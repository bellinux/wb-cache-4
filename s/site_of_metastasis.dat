50|$|In medicine, Blumer's shelf is {{a finding}} felt in rectal {{examination}} {{that indicates that}} a tumor has metastasized to the pouch of Douglas. It is usually a <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>metastasis</b> of cancers of the lung, pancreas, and stomach.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{different}} parts of the brain are responsible for different functions, symptoms vary depending on the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>metastasis</b> within the brain. However, brain metastases should be considered in any cancer patient who presents with neurological or behavioral changes.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{there are}} no lymphatic {{channels}} to the uveal tract, metastasis occurs through local extension and/or blood borne dissemination. The most common <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>metastasis</b> for uveal melanoma is the liver; the liver is the first <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>metastasis</b> for 80%-90% of ocular melanoma patients. [...] Other common sites of metastasis include the lung, bones and just beneath the skin (subcutaneous). Approximately 50 percent of patients will develop metastases within 15 years after treatment of the primary tumor, and the liver will be involved 90% of the time. Metastasis can occur more than 10 years after treatment of the primary tumor, and patients {{should not be considered}} cured even after a 10-year interval of monitoring. [...] Molecular features of the tumor including Chromosome 3 status, Chromosome 6p status, and Chromosome 8q status and gene expression profiling (such as the DecisionDx-UM test) can be used to adjust this likelihood of metastasis for an individual patient.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> <b>metastasis</b> are the lung, {{abdominal}} lymph nodes, and bone.|$|R
50|$|For surface epithelial-stromal tumors, {{the most}} common <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> <b>metastasis</b> are the pleural cavity (33%), the liver (26%), and the lungs (3%).|$|R
50|$|Treatment is {{varied and}} {{depends on the}} <b>site</b> and extent <b>of</b> tumor involvement, <b>site(s)</b> <b>of</b> <b>metastasis,</b> and {{specific}} individual factors. Surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy have all been used to treat these masses, although studies on survival {{have yet to be}} conducted to delineate various treatment regimens.|$|R
5000|$|Bone is {{the third}} most common {{location}} for metastasis, after the lung and liver. While any type of cancer is capable of forming metastatic tumors within bone, the microenvironment of the marrow tends to favor particular types of cancer, including prostate, breast, and lung cancers. Particularly in prostate cancer, bone metastases {{tend to be the}} only <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>metastasis.</b> [...] The most common sites of bone metastases are the spine, pelvis, ribs, skull, and proximal femur.|$|E
5000|$|The {{prognosis}} for brain metastases is variable. It {{depends on the}} type of primary cancer, the age of the patient, the absence or presence of extracranial metastases, and the number of metastatic sites in the brain. [...] For patients who do not undergo treatment the average survival is between one and two months. [...] However, in some patients, such as those with no extracranial metastases, those who are younger than 65, and those with a single <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>metastasis</b> in the brain only, prognosis is much better, with median survival rates of up to 13.5 months. Because brain metastasis can originate from various different primary cancers, the Karnofsky performance score is the used for a more specific prognosis.|$|E
5000|$|Apocrine gland anal sac adenocarcinomas first {{appear as}} small lumps {{associated}} {{with one of}} the anal sacs (rarely bilateral), but they can grow to a large size. Smaller tumors are undetectable without a rectal examination, while larger tumors can cause pain and straining to defecate. Between 25 and 40 percent of dogs with these tumors will also develop hypercalcaemia through secretion of parathyroid hormone-related protein by the tumor. [...] Symptoms of hypercalcaemia include increased drinking and urination, vomiting, loss of appetite, weight loss, and bradycardia (slow heart rate). Apocrine gland anal sac adenocarcinomas also have a tendency to metastasize to the regional lymph nodes, spleen, and eventually lungs and, less commonly, bones. [...] The sublumbar (iliac) lymph nodes are the most common <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>metastasis</b> and can become larger than the original tumor.|$|E

5000|$|Rhabdomyosarcoma, or RMS, is an {{aggressive}} and highly malignant {{form of cancer}} that develops from skeletal (striated) muscle cells that have failed to fully differentiate. It is {{generally considered to be}} a disease of childhood, as the vast majority of cases occur in those below the age of 18. It is commonly described as one of the [...] "small, round, blue cell tumours of childhood" [...] due to its appearance on an H&E stain. Despite being a relatively rare cancer, it accounts for approximately 40% of all recorded soft tissue sarcomas. RMS can occur in any site on the body, but is primarily found in the head, neck, orbit, genitourinary tract, genitals, and extremities. There are no clear risk factors for RMS, but the disease has been associated with some congenital abnormalities. Signs and symptoms vary according to tumor site, and prognosis is closely tied to the location of the primary tumor. Common <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>metastasis</b> include the lungs, bone marrow, and bones. There are many classification systems for RMS and a variety of defined histological types. Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common type and comprises about 60% of cases. Patient outcomes vary considerably, with 5 years survival rates between 35% and 95% {{depending on the type of}} RMS involved, so clear diagnosis is critical for effective treatment and management. [...] Unfortunately, accurate and quick diagnosis is often difficult due to the heterogeneity of RMS tumors and a lack of strong genetic markers of the disease. Treatment usually involves a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Sixty percent to 70% of newly diagnosed patients with nonmetastatic disease can be cured using this combined approach to therapy. Despite aggressive multimodality treatment, less than 20% of patients with metastatic RMS are able to be cured of their disease.|$|E
40|$|Every year, 31 230 men {{and women}} are {{diagnosed}} with colorectal carcinoma, and up to 60 % of these will ultimately develop advanced disease. However, there is little information to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from palliative chemotherapy. This analysis is unique in evaluating how the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>metastasis</b> influences response and survival. A database of 497 patients treated within randomized clinical trials using 5 -Fluorouracil (5 FU) -based chemotherapy at the Royal Marsden Hospital was analysed. The potential for <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>metastasis</b> as a predictive variable for response to chemotherapy and survival was examined, in addition to other clinical parameters. The presence of liver metastases was a better predictor for overall response than either performance status or number of metastatic sites on presentation. Probability of response was significantly decreased by a raised serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and presence of peritoneal metastases. In liver metastases, a normal serum albumin was as significant a predictor for response as good performance status. The most important predictor for survival was initial performance status. The number of metastatic sites on presentation had no influence on survival. <b>Site</b> <b>of</b> <b>metastasis</b> can predict for response to 5 FU-based chemotherapy and patients should be stratified according to the involved <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>metastasis</b> in the future. © 1999 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Accurate staging is the {{cornerstone}} in management of lung cancer. It helps to determine the therapeutic modality and to assess prognosis. More than half of bronchogenic carcinomas have distant metastasis {{at the time of}} diagnosis. Presence <b>of</b> <b>metastasis</b> confers stage 4 for the disease. Presence <b>of</b> <b>metastasis</b> also increases patient morbidity and mortality. So the knowledge <b>of</b> pattern and <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> <b>metastasis</b> in bronchogenic carcinoma is crucial for its detection and management. Staging of bronchogenic carcinoma is one of the important indications for Positron Emission Tomography. Combined Computed tomography and PET (PET-CT) is superior to either modality alone in staging of lung cancer. It helps in identifying the <b>site</b> and morphology <b>of</b> lesion. Aims and Objectives- 1. To determine the <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> metastases in Bronchogenic carcinoma by PETCT 2. To compare <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> metastases with the histological cell type MATERIALS AND METHODS It was a hospital based retrospective study involving 78 patients with histologically proven bronchogenic carcinoma who underwent PETCT scan from June 2016 -May 2017 in A J Institute of medical sciences, Mangalore.

40|$|The liver is {{the most}} common <b>site</b> <b>of</b> distant <b>metastasis</b> from {{colorectal}} cancer. About one-fourth of patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer have no other <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> <b>metastasis</b> and can be treated with regional therapies directed toward their liver tumors. Surgical resection of colorectal cancer liver metastases can result in a 24 %- 38 % five-year survival, but only a minority of patients are candidates for resection. Other regional therapies such as cryosurgery, radiofrequency ablation, and hepatic intra-arterial chemotherapy may be offered to patients with unresectable but isolated liver metastases. The efficacy of these treatments is still being determined. For most patients with spread of metastatic colorectal cancer beyond the liver, systemic chemotherapy rather than regional therapy is a more appropriate option.
