2500|$|In 1996 Valdobrev {{married his}} high school love Jana. [...] "We have many shared {{memories}} as childhood sweethearts in Stara Zagora. We were 10 when we first met. Our parents were coming back from an excursion, we {{got off the bus}} at the same station and headed in different directions. After a few meters I stopped and turned to look back. She had stopped too and was looking at me. We <b>stood</b> <b>like</b> that for a few moments, staring at each other, our parents holding our hands. Growing up with someone's memories and making that journey through adulthood together is probably what makes a relationship strong. No one knows me better than Jana." [...] In 1998 Jana gave birth to their daughter Maria. Three weeks after that Valdobrev had a terrible car accident that almost cost him his life and kept him immovable and out of action for a year. For that reason he couldn’t join Regis Wargnier’s Oscar-nominated film production East/West, for which he'd been cast to play opposite Catherine Deneuve and Sandrine Bonnaire.|$|E
2500|$|The tie was the {{greatest}} of achievements for the underdog Commodores. The game's result was [...] "a great surprise to the sporting world." [...] It features prominently in the school's history. [...] "The Commodores surprising even to their followers, fought the Michigan eleven, headed by Coach Yost, to a standstill." [...] Commodore fans celebrated by throwing some 3,000 seat cushions onto the field. Many publications called it [...] "one of the big moments of the gridiron season." [...] The Vanderbilt Alumnus wrote [...] "That 0 to 0 finish meant night shirt parades and a sleepless night of jollification. [...] And so it was." [...] Vanderbilt's yearbook The Commodore remarked, [...] "Whence came that irresistible spirit that shattered the Michigan plays no one knows. [...] Every man on the squad possessed it. [...] It was the re-enactment {{of more than one}} chapter in the record of Vanderbilt's past. [...] There never was a greater reversal in the history of athletics than that day. [...] The dwarf <b>stood</b> <b>like</b> a Titan foot to foot and breast to breast with the grim Michigan giant, and disarmed him." [...] It was said one Detroit reporter wrote [...] "Michigan was lucky to escape with their lives." [...] Sam S. Greene remarked, [...] "The defensive showing of Vanderbilt against the touted attack of the Western conference moleskin wearers was a revelation even to the ardent followers of the gold and black, who had expected a defeat by at least three touchdowns." [...] Captain Neely had tears of joy streaming down his face by game's end. [...] "They were lucky to tie us," [...] Neely later said of Michigan.|$|E
