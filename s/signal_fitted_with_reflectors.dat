40|$|Abstract- Simple hybrid photovoltaic/thermal or PV/T solar {{water systems}} are commercially unattractive {{due to its}} less {{combined}} efficiency, low concentration ratios, long payback period etc. The augmentation of solar radiation on module surface is the easy and cost effective method to increase concentration ratio and combined PV/T efficiency of simple hybrid solar system.

This paper offers design and performance analysis of oscillatory flow heat exchanger used in hybrid system <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> aluminum <b>reflectors.</b> The investigational results such as performance efficiencies of photovoltaic, thermal, and combined PV/T system over a range of operating conditions are determined and assessed for latitude of Mumbai. At solar radiation of 929 W/m 2 and water flow rate of 0. 042 kg/sec, the present hybrid system has generated combined PV/T efficiency of 65. 10 % with PV efficiency of 12. 50 %.

If the <b>signal</b> is <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> TPWS, the driver resets the Driver reminder appliance, pushes the TPWS Trainstop Override button in the cab, and proceeds cautiously through the section. If the train reaches the next signal without finding an obstruction, he must obey its aspect, at which point he can revert to normal working.|$|R
5000|$|Motion capture uses cameras placed {{around a}} subject. The subject is {{generally}} <b>fitted</b> either <b>with</b> <b>reflectors</b> (passive motion capture) or sources (active motion capture) that precisely determine the subject's position in space. The data {{recorded by the}} cameras is then digitized and converted into a three-dimensional computer model of the subject. Until recently, {{the size of the}} detectors/sources used by motion capture systems made the technology inappropriate for facial capture. However, miniaturization and other advancements have made motion capture a viable tool for computer facial animation. Facial motion capture was used extensively in Polar Express by Imageworks where hundreds of motion points were captured. This film was very accomplished and while it attempted to recreate realism, it was criticized for having fallen in the 'uncanny valley', the realm where animation realism is sufficient for human recognition and to convey the emotional message but where the characters fail to be perceived as realistic. The main difficulties of motion capture are the quality of the data which may include vibration as well as the retargeting of the geometry of the points.|$|R

The chiral metamamaterials has simplified fabrication design but still capable to exhibit different refractive index for each circular polarization. Nonlinear response of metamaterials was observed by terahertz emission spectroscopy.

By positioning a board reflector close to a light source, its effective size can be increased by [...] "bouncing" [...] the light off it. A very common example of this technique is the traditional umbrella reflector, invented by George Larson, typically having a gold, silver or matte white interior onto which a lamp <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> a circular <b>reflector</b> is projected, providing a broad, soft illumination.

40|$|The Himalayan endemic alpine genus Roscoea, {{like other}} members of ginger family, {{exhibits}} the combination of floral traits that would fit pollination by long distant foragers such as bees, birds or flies. We studied the pollination biology of Roscoea alpina, observed potential floral visitors and determined their foraging behaviour, visitation frequency and pollination efficiency, to seek {{evidence in support of}} the pollination syndrome hypothesis. We also measured the floral spectra of R. alpina flowers to evaluate if <b>signals</b> <b>fit</b> <b>with</b> the currently known framework for observed floral visitors. We found that R. alpina have autonomous selfing and pollinator-mediated crossing, but lack apomixis. We observed that a beetle (Mylabris sp.), and a moth (Macroglossum nycteris) visit the flowers of R. alpina for pollen and nectar feeding respectively. Our field observations, the stigmatic pollen count and fruit set data indicated that the visit by the beetle was legitimate, while that of the moth was illegitimate. Emasculated flowers visited by beetles set as many fruits and seeds/fruit as auto-selfed and naturally pollinated flowers, while emasculated flowers excluded from beetle visits did not set fruit and seed; indicating that a single visit of a beetle to the flowers of R. alpina can facilitate pollination. We found that flower spectral signal of R. alpina does not fit typical spectra previously reported for beetle or bee-visited flowers. Our results suggest that, to ensure reproductive success in alpine habitat, R. alpina has evolved autonomous selfing as a predominant mode of reproduction, while beetle pollination would promote genetic diversity of this plant species. The visitation of beetles to the flowers of R. alpina, despite floral signal mismatch with the classically associated beetle vision, suggests that a different visual processing may operate in this plant-pollinator interaction at high altitudes...|$|R
40|$|In February 1993, {{measurements}} {{to determine}} side reflection on bicycles {{were carried out}} {{in a number of}} Dutch cities. At bicycle sheds of secondary schools, approximately 76 % of cycles were found to be <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> side <b>reflectors</b> to both wheels, while circa 17 % were found to have no side reflection at all. Bicycle sheds at railway stations gave comparative figures of approximately 74 % and 12 %, respectively. The results of previous measurements showed that the figures for school bicycle sheds were better than those for railway stations. However, the current situation found little difference between the percentage of side reflection at either location. The ATB category includes: "all terrain bikes", mountain bikes, city bikes and hybrid bicycles. It can be determined that currently, approximately 20 % of bicycles stalled at schools are represented by the ATB category. Only 32 % of ATBs were found to have side reflection on both wheels, while 58 % had none at all. At measurement sites where many ATBs were stalled, the percentage of side reflection found was therefore less. The presence of side reflectors on both wheels increases from circa 76 % to approximately 87 %, provided that these ATBs are not included in the school assessment. At company bicycle sheds, only few ATBs were found...|$|R
40|$|Since January 1, 1987, side {{reflection}} {{in the form of}} wheel circles fitted to both wheels has been compulsory for all bicycles in The Netherlands. From this initial date until the year 1994, the SWOV Institute for Road Safety Research has made a general inventory. The aim is to assess the level of compliance regarding these legally prescribed side reflectors. The most recent observations, made in February 1994, showed that about 72 % of cycles stored in the sheds of secondary schools and about 77 % of cycles stored in company bicycle sheds were <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> side <b>reflectors</b> to both wheels. The 1994 observations produced the following conclusions: (1) to date, a considerable proportion of bicycles still fail to meet the legal requirements concerning side reflectors; (2) the situation at schools appears to have actually worsened somewhat, while the proportion of side reflectors at company bicycle sheds seems to have improved slightly; and (3) since the last SWOV report dating from 1993, the minimal presence of side reflectors particularly amongst mountain bikes has not improved. The SWOV believes that the 1994 figures offer even more grounds to take action than the 1993 figures. The government, in consultation with industry, should formulate equipment requirements for all cycle types. See also C 2411 (IRRD 862253) ...|$|R
