5|$|Blackouts in {{freediving}} {{can occur}} when the breath is held long enough for metabolic activity to reduce the oxygen partial pressure <b>sufficiently</b> <b>to</b> cause loss of consciousness. This is accelerated by exertion, which uses oxygen faster, or by hyperventilation, which reduces the carbon dioxide level in the blood. Lower carbon dioxide levels increase the oxygen-haemoglobin affinity, reducing availability of oxygen to brain tissue {{towards the end of}} the dive (Bohr effect); they also suppress the urge to breathe, making it easier to hold the breath to the point of blackout. This can happen at any depth.|$|E

5|$|Since American kestrels are carnivores, toxic {{chemical}} runoff ingested by their prey can concentrate {{at high levels}} in their blood. Wild kestrels are subject to immunomodulation, or an altered immune response, to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a group of industrial flame retardants that may leach from factories into the environment. When PBDEs accumulate in body tissues of kestrels, the T-cell mediated immune response decreases in efficiency. As a result, kestrels that ingest PBDEs may not respond <b>sufficiently</b> <b>to</b> viruses or other invading microorganisms. In addition, certain PBDEs may suppress growth {{and development of the}} spleen and bursa in American kestrels.|$|E

He purchased a ship and sailed toward Micronesia, intending {{to work on a}} mission. Bachelot's health significantly worsened after leaving Hawaii and he died at sea on December 5, 1837. He was buried on an islet off the coast of Pohnpei. In 1838, a small chapel was built near his grave.|$|E
5|$|The {{difference}} {{in the shape of}} the light curves is believed to be caused, in the case of TypeII-L supernovae, by the expulsion of most of the hydrogen envelope of the progenitor star. The plateau phase in TypeII-P supernovae is due to a change in the opacity of the exterior layer. The shock wave ionizes the hydrogen in the outer envelope – stripping the electron from the hydrogen atom – resulting in a significant increase in the opacity. This prevents photons from the inner parts of the explosion from escaping. When the hydrogen cools <b>sufficiently</b> <b>to</b> recombine, the outer layer becomes transparent.|$|E

5|$|There is some {{evidence}} that the youngest galactic supernova, G1.9+0.3, occurred in the late 19th century, considerably more recently than Cassiopeia A from around 1680. Neither supernova was noted at the time. In the case of G1.9+0.3, high extinction along the plane of the galaxy could have dimmed the event <b>sufficiently</b> <b>to</b> go unnoticed. The situation for Cassiopeia A is less clear. Infrared light echos have been detected showing that it was a type IIb supernova and was not in a region of especially high extinction.|$|E
5|$|Until the 1970s Crucibulum {{was thought}} to be monotypic, {{containing}} the single species C.laeve (formerly C.vulgaris). This was in part due to the stance that Curtis Gates Lloyd and other mycologists had taken in the early 20th century, believing that the designation of new species was not justifiable due to the existence of intermediate forms in similar habitats and close proximity. In 1970–71, Brodie discovered and reported two variants that differed from C.laeve <b>sufficiently</b> <b>to</b> justify naming them as new species.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa behind Hurricane Luis on August 31. Strong outflow from Luis prevented development of the wave, and it continued westward until crossing into the eastern Pacific Ocean on September 12. Convection increased as it moved through the Gulf of Tehuantepec, and the cloud pattern organized <b>sufficiently</b> <b>to</b> warrant Dvorak classifications for the system on September 15. Based on the development of a low-level circulation, it is estimated the system organized into Tropical Depression Eleven-E on September 16 while located around 290miles (465km) south of Manzanillo, Mexico. Due to the tropical depression moving over an area of warm water temperatures with favorable upper level outflow, the National Hurricane Center forecast the tropical depression to slowly intensify to 70mph (110km/h) winds within 72hours the forecast early on September 16.|$|E

5|$|According to the Big Bang theory, the Universe {{originated}} {{in an extremely}} hot and dense state about 13.8 billion years ago and began expanding rapidly. About 380,000 years later the Universe had cooled <b>sufficiently</b> <b>to</b> allow protons and electrons to combine and form hydrogen—the so-called recombination epoch. When this happened, matter and energy became decoupled, allowing photons to travel freely through space. The matter that remained following the initial expansion has since undergone gravitational collapse to create stars, galaxies and other astronomical objects, leaving behind a deep vacuum that forms {{what is now called}} outer space. As light has a finite velocity, this theory also constrains the size of the directly observable universe. This leaves open the question as to whether the Universe is finite or infinite.|$|E
5|$|As Bellerophon slowly drifted away, she was sighted by the 74-gun , {{approaching}} the centre. It was by now about 9 pm; {{in the darkness}} Swiftsures captain, Benjamin Hallowell, was unable to identify the dismasted ship and presumed {{that she was a}} damaged French ship attempting to escape. He debated firing into her, but decided to hold fire and press on to the French centre, where he eventually came to anchor astern of Orient, close to Bellerophons original position. Darby had by this time recovered <b>sufficiently</b> <b>to</b> resume command, and at his order the battered Bellerophon came to anchor at the east end of the bay, and her crew began making repairs. The battle raged throughout the night, and eventually ended in a decisive victory for the British. The next five days were spent repairing the ship and burying the dead. 49 men were killed and 148 wounded on Bellerophon. Eight more died of their wounds in the following week.|$|E

SAS announced on 10 March 2004 that SAS and Braathens would be merged into a single company, SAS Braathens, in May. At the same time, the airline would create separate national airlines for Sweden and Denmark. SAS Braathens would operate 50 aircraft, all variations of the 737. The company took over the operating licence of Braathens, including the IATA and ICAO code, and callsign. Because all the operations streamlined and coordinated, {{there would be no}} further downstaffing due to the merger. From 1 June 2007, SAS Braathens was rebranded to Scandinavian Airlines, making it identical to the branding in Sweden and Denmark, although it remain a separate limited company named SAS Norge AS.|$|E
