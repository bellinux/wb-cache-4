5|$|The Admiral Hipper-class {{ships were}} powered by {{three sets of}} geared <b>steam</b> <b>{{turbines}}.</b> Admiral Hippers and Blüchers engines were built by Blohm & Voss, while Prinz Eugens turbines were built by Germaniawerft. The turbines installed on Seydlitzs and Lützows engines were manufactured by Deschimag. Steam was provided {{in the first three}} ships by twelve ultra-high-pressure boilers. Seydlitz and Lützow were equipped with nine double-ended high-pressure boilers. Admiral Hippers and Prinz Eugens boilers were manufactured by Wagner, while the boilers for the other three ships were built by La Mont.|$|E
5|$|The station's {{boiler house}} housed three {{coal-fired}} Lancashire boilers, each of 200 HP capacity and each with individual economisers. These boilers provided steam for two 410 kilowatt (kW) and one 150kW direct current Parsons turbo generators. This gave the station a total generating capacity of 970kW. Before {{being used in}} the Lemington power station, these generators had been used in Forth Banks Power Station and in Newburn Steelworks. One of the <b>steam</b> <b>turbines</b> from these sets is now on display at the Electric Power and Historical Museum in Yokohama, Japan, after sitting on display in the entrance to Blyth Power Station for many years.|$|E
5|$|Water is {{essential}} to a thermal power station, heated to create steam to turn the <b>steam</b> <b>turbines.</b> Water used in the boilers is taken from two licensed boreholes on site. Once this water has been through the turbines it is cooled by condensers using water taken from the nearby River Ouse. Water is pumped from the river by a pumphouse on the river, north of the station. Once it has been through the condenser, the water is cooled {{by one of the}} natural draft cooling towers, with two towers serving each generating set. Once cooled, the water is discharged back into the river.|$|E
40|$|In {{the study}} of the {{condensation}} phenomenon in the operation of <b>steam</b> <b>turbine,</b> the existence of two-phase flow in the low pressure stage becomes significant in causing problems regarding the blade life span and efficiency reduction.

5|$|For {{creating}} the steam to turn <b>steam</b> <b>turbines</b> and generate electricity, and for cooling the steam coming {{away from the}} turbines, water is needed, and is thus beneficial to have near any thermal power station. The cooling water that {{is used in the}} Lynemouth power station is taken from a body of water located close to the plant, the North Sea. The water is transferred from the sea to the plant by a series of shafts and tunnels. There are three condensers (one per each generating set) in the interior of the power station, which are used to cool the heated water before it is reused in the steam cycle. The cooling water is then transferred back to the North Sea.|$|E
5|$|From the hoppers, {{the waste}} falls onto the furnace-charging chute {{and from there}} onto the incinerating grate. Here it is burned at a {{temperature}} in excess of 1,200°C. This heat is then converted into super heated steam through the plant's boilers. This in turn powers <b>steam</b> <b>turbines,</b> much {{in the same way}} as a conventional thermal power station. Electricity is generated at 11 kilovolts. After exiting the turbines, the steam is condensed back to water. For the original two incinerating lines use river water from the Tees as a cooling medium, whereas in the third line, water is condensed through air cooled condenser. The cooled water is treated and reused in the boilers.|$|E

5|$|The two cruisers {{ordered in}} the 1905–1906 program {{represented}} a continuation in the slow, upward trend in displacement, {{though the two}} ships had the same top speed as the earlier Königsberg-class ships.

All subsequent designs adopted <b>steam</b> <b>turbines</b> universally. Dresden and Emden had very active and short careers.

5|$|The {{two ships}} were based in {{southern}} Italy during World War I {{to help ensure}} that the Austro-Hungarian Navy surface fleet would be contained in the Adriatic. Neither vessel saw any combat during the conflict. After the war, they cruised the Mediterranean and were involved in several international incidents, including at Corfu in 1923. In 1933, both ships were placed in reserve. In 1937 the ships began a lengthy reconstruction. The modifications included removing their center main battery turret and boring {{out the rest of}} the guns to , strengthening their armor protection, installing new boilers and <b>steam</b> <b>turbines,</b> and lengthening their hulls. The reconstruction work lasted until 1940, by which time Italy was already engaged in World War II.|$|E
5|$|Döblin's 1918 comic novel {{has been}} seen, in its {{experimental}} narrative technique, {{its refusal to}} psychologize its characters, and its depictions of Berlin as modern metropolis, as a precursor to Döblin's better-known Berlin Alexanderplatz. Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine (Wadzek's Battle with the Steam Turbine) {{tells the story of}} Wadzek, a factory owner locked in a losing battle with a more powerful competitor. His futile and increasingly delusional countermeasures culminate in the fortification and quixotic defense of his family's garden house in suburban Reinickendorf. Following the dissipation of this endeavor, he suffers a breakdown and finally flees the country, eloping aboard a steamship bound for America that is powered by the <b>steam</b> <b>turbines</b> of his victorious competitor. Döblin wrote the novel in the fall of 1914, submitting it to extensive stylistic revisions while serving as a doctor on the Western front; it was published in May 1918 by the Fischer Verlag. In its stringent refusal of a tragic tone, the book earned the praise of a young Bertolt Brecht.|$|E
50|$|<b>Steam</b> <b>turbine</b> {{governing}} is {{the procedure}} {{of controlling the}} flow rate of steam to a <b>steam</b> <b>turbine</b> so as to maintain its speed of rotation as constant. The variation in load during the operation of a <b>steam</b> <b>turbine</b> can {{have a significant impact}} on its performance. In a practical situation the load frequently varies from the designed or economic load and thus there always exists a considerable deviation from the desired performance of the turbine. The primary objective in the <b>steam</b> <b>turbine</b> operation is to maintain a constant speed of rotation irrespective of the varying load. This can be achieved by means of governing in a steam turbine.There are many types of governors.|$|R
