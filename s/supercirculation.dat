50|$|The lift of a wing can {{be greatly}} {{increased}} with blowing flow control. With mechanical slots the natural boundary layer limits the boundary layer control {{pressure to the}} freestream total head. Blowing with {{a small proportion of}} engine airflow (internal blown flap) increases the lift. Using much higher quantities of gas from the engine exhaust, which increases the effective chord of the flap (the jet flap), produces <b>supercirculation,</b> or forced circulation up to the theoretical potential flow maximum. Surpassing this limit requires the addition of direct thrust.|$|E
40|$|The term <b>super{{circulation}}</b> {{refers to}} an active, fluidic circulation control method used {{for a variety of}} aeronautical applications. In particular, this paper refers to <b>supercirculation</b> of entrainment wings. Using experimental data as well as some basic analytical equations, a mathematical expression is used to define supercirculation; subsequently an optimization calculation is provided for the minimal blowing pressure ratio needed for achieving <b>supercirculation.</b> Also, based on the proposed definition, a screening equation is determined in order to discern whether or not a certain airfoil has a geometry suited for <b>supercirculation...</b>|$|E
40|$|Thrust-induced <b>supercirculation</b> {{effects from}} thrust {{vectoring}} have indicated {{a potential for}} not only increasing maneuverability of fighter aircraft {{but also as a}} means of improving cruise performance. The current study investigated a partial-span rectangular jet-exhaust nozzle located at the wing trailing edge that acts similar to a jet flap by increasing lift due to <b>supercirculation.</b> This paper summarizes experimental studies including the effects of nozzle deflection angle, wing camber, and nozzle shape and exit location on lift, drag and load distributions. The results indicate that significant increases in thrust-induced lift along with substantial decreases in drag are possible...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} of the thrust-induced longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics of three fighter-type configurations is presented. A brief discussion of the take-off and landing requirements {{for the next generation}} fighter aircraft leads to the conclusion that advances in lift coefficient and thrust reversing will be required to allow short-field operation. Typical power-on longitudinal aerodynamic data for the three fighter configurations, indicating different approaches to meeting the high-lift coefficient requirement, are discussed. Thrust reversing is not addressed in this paper. The power-on data are analyzed to determine what power effects are present, that is, direct thrust, boundary-layer control, vortex flows, or <b>supercirculation.</b> The results of the analysis indicate, for the configurations studied, that induced effects are small compared to direct thrust and that boundary-layer control, rather than leading-edge vortex flows or <b>supercirculation,</b> is the only significant thrust-induced effect...|$|E
40|$|An {{assessment}} {{was made of}} the aerodynamic uncertainties associated with the design of a cold-deck-environment Navy VSTOL fighter/attack aircraft utilizing jet-diffuser ejectors for vertical lift and vectored-engine-over-wing blowing for <b>supercirculation</b> benefits. The critical aerodynamic uncertainties were determined as those associated with the constraints which size the aircraft to a specified set of requirements. A wind tunnel model and test programs are recommended for resolving these uncertainties...|$|E
40|$|The flow entraining {{capabilities}} of the Circulation Control Wing high lift system were employed to provide an even stronger STOL potential when synergistically combined with upper surface mounted engines. The resulting configurations generate very high <b>supercirculation</b> lift {{in addition to a}} vertical component of the pneumatically deflected engine thrust. A series of small scale wind tunnel tests and full scale static thrust deflection tests are discussed which provide a sufficient data base performance. These tests results show thrust deflections of greater than 90 deg produced pneumatically by nonmoving aerodynamic surfaces, and the ability to maintain constant high lift while varying the propulsive force from high thrust recovery required for short takeoff to high drag generation required for short low speed landings...|$|E
40|$|During {{the second}} half of the 20 th century, Henri Coanda had {{extensively}} studied theCoanda effect and also it’s application for high lift devices that use –in one way or another- <b>supercirculation.</b> A previous work has been done for using the Coanda effect to generate perpendicularforces to the aircraft trajectory– including aircraft specifically designed to attain short take off suchas the An- 72 and YC- 14. Dwelling on the same principles, the author had tried to imagine and test a 2 D thrust vectoring deviceusing differentiated super circulation on two flat surfaces placed near the jet exhaust. The success ofthis endeavor has been limited because the forces produced were not as great as anticipated. However, the numerical simulations indicated the presence of another, opposite effect, more powerfuland potentially more useful than the first: the counter circulation. This paper describes the working principles of a two dimensional thrust vectoring nozzle aimingsatisfy the need for a conventional rudder to control yaw and also shows the prospect of upgrading itto a 3 D thrust vectoring nozzle...|$|E
40|$|This chapter has {{presented}} a new propelled wing concept with a breakthrough potential {{in terms of}} lift generation, much higher than any other wing concept ever designed before. This concept could be intended to {{be the basis of}} new aircraft with a huge potential in terms of lift even at low speed which can emulate many of the operation of the helicopters with major energy benefits. In particular, it appears evident that the presented concept has a huge potential of future application into the aeronautic domain because of the realization of three simultaneous effects: Depression at {{the leading edge of the}} wing that reduces the drag, Coanda effect and related <b>supercirculation</b> effects caused by the high-speed jet that generates a huge increase in terms of lift. The novel design of the wing as shown in Fig. 7 shows a promising candidate for the new design of the aircraft and shows good simulation with CFD. However, it will require further validation through 3 D CFD study and experiments, which are on the way to be performed...|$|E
40|$|The {{tactical}} {{need for}} {{fixed wing aircraft}} with hovering capably has long been recognized bythe military for two reasons: increased safety when landing on aircraft carriers and higher velocitiesthat the ones obtainable with rotary wing aircraft. Thus far, the only concept governing the field of vertical flight was to use thrust either from a liftfan-F 35, puffer ducts –Harrier or smaller jet engines-D 0 31 or Yak- 141, i. e. direct lift thrust. In this paper {{we will look at}} the prospect of using a combination of the Coanda effect with theVenturi effect to generate lift by so- called “supercirculation”. This novel approach can yield manyadvantages to conventional vertical lifting by providing a more stable platform and requiring lowerpower settings – and thus lower fuel consumption. The aircraft has a fixed, negatively sweped wing that uses circulation control to achieve lift atzero air speed. The fluid used for <b>supercirculation</b> will come from the fan thrust reversers – which, ifcorrectly managed, can give a sufficient flow for lifting the craft and also a negative thrust componentto compensate for the positive thrust of the primary flow (not diverted) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{accelerating}} {{growth of}} environmental awareness {{has not stopped}} at the aerospace industry. The need for greener and more efficient airplanes threatens to outpace the flow of new technology. This has ignited development in several fields, {{one of which is}} active flow control (AFC). Active flow control has quickly proven its tremendous potential for real applications. Even though the roots of this technology date back a century, we still lack fundamental understanding. This thesis combines both modern and traditional approaches to lay out a new foundation for future research. The thesis first focuses on the rising stars of active flow control: the so-called fluidic oscillators or sweeping jet actuators. These devices consist of simple, rigid internal geometries that create a sweeping output jet motion. The fluid dynamic interactions with the internal geometry are studied in detail using high-speed Schlieren imaging. Additionally, the influence of adjacent sweeping jets is investigated. It is revealed that the internal driving mechanism is far stronger than the fluid dynamic interactions at the outlet, resulting in a completely independent jet behavior. Next, a high-lift airfoil design is combined with active flow control, and an extensive wind tunnel study is carried out. It is shown that for the given wing design active flow control leads to much higher lift benefits when applied to the trailing edge. Applied to the leading edge active flow control disrupts the vortex lift of the high-lift airfoil, resulting in a deleterious lift effect; however, it shows potential for pitch moment control. This project also underlines the advantages of jet-like active flow control over steady blowing actuation at limited available mass flow rates. The momentum input coefficient as an important parameter in active flow control is discussed in detail, identifying common misconceptions and difficulties that hinder its proper calculation. An innovative, much simpler approach is introduced. This allows a detailed study of the underlying physics, unveiling unknown limitations of active flow control. The approach is then used as a model to derive the novel concept of thermal active flow control. Experimental studies, including a wind tunnel test campaign, are performed to confirm the viability of the concept for practical applications. The new calculation method of the input momentum coefficient emphasizes its weakness as a similarity parameter in active flow control studies. The extended mass flow coefficient is introduced as a new parameter. It is shown that it can overcome the deficiencies of the input momentum coefficient without suffering other disadvantages. Its further investigation leads to a deeper understanding of active flow control, which is supported by PIV experiments. The main findings of this investigation divide active flow control into three different "states": boundary layer thickening, separation control, and <b>supercirculation.</b> </p...|$|E
