40|$|It {{has been}} {{recently}} suggested that <b>sponsor</b> <b>identification</b> may be biased {{in favor of}} prominent brands. All things equal, consumers {{are more likely to}} attribute sponsorship to brands that they perceive to be more prominent in the marketplace, such as large-share brands. This article offers additional empirical evidence for this phenomenon and examines the underlying processes. The results of a controlled laboratory experiment replicate the phenomenon and show that this bias arises only when consumers are unable to retrieve the name of the sponsor directly from memory. In other words, direct retrieval is the default process of <b>sponsor</b> <b>identification.</b> The prominence bias is therefore more likely to occur in cluttered media environments where learning the event-sponsor associations is difficult. The findings further suggest that this bias emanates from a relatively controlled hypothesis-testing process that combines retrieval and constructive processes. During identification, the prominence of the brand is used as a confirmation cue that either validates or conflicts with people’s vague recollections. The results also indicate that prominent brands identified or misidentified as sponsors do in fact benefit from enhanced brand image. 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

40|$|Event {{sponsors}} {{often do}} not receive proper credit for their efforts. This issue was examined in a field study involving over 300 basebaii fans attending minor league games during the summer season. Signal detection analyses reveai that, even among such sports fans, the abiiity to correctly discriminate actual officiai sponsors of the home team from matched foiis, although above chance, was rather poor. Consistent with recent laboratory findings, <b>sponsor</b> <b>identification</b> responses were further found to be heavily influenced by the mere plausibility of the brand as a potential sponsor. This plausibility effect was equally pronounced for actual sponsors and for foiis. The phenomenon seems {{to be driven by}} a reiiance on plausibility-based inferences that was widespread across respondents (as opposed to limited to a few). These piausibiiity-based inferences, whether correct or incorrect, can have as much infiuence on attributions of sponsorship as actuai exposure to genuine sponsorship information.

40|$|Recent surveys {{find that}} while {{managers}} favored issues of media coverage {{not more than}} ten years ago, now they rate sponsor awareness and image transfer from the sponsored event to the sponsor as the main reasons for engaging in sport C. However, the evalua-tion of C has not kept up with this change in priorities. Companies seem to be reluctant to evaluate sponsor awareness even though measurement is straightforward and not very costly. An important reason might be that previous studies showed unsatisfying effects of “ambush marketing”. In this form of marketing, other firms make consumers believe, incor-rectly, that these companies are the actual sponsors of an event. In the case of image transfer, evaluation seems to be difficult {{due to a lack of}} a compelling comprehensive and testable model. We examine these obstacles of assessing sponsor awareness and image transfer in sport sponsorships in two ways. As a means of reducing the danger of ambush marketing, we analyze what drives correct <b>sponsor</b> <b>identification.</b> Our empirical results indicate that event-sponsor fit, event involvement, and exposure are the dominant factors predicting sponsor recall. These factors offer sponsors a basis for successful sponsorship planning and execution through the selection of an appropriate sponsorship. Second, we propose and empirically test a model that assesses image transfer in sport sponsorships. We find support for a basic level of image transfer for all sponsors. However, more detailed research and interpretation of results suggest that the magnitude of image transfer depends on two factors, sponsorship leverage and event-sponsor fit...|$|E
40|$|Packaging and {{sponsorship}} {{have been}} recognised as key tools for gaining competitive advantage, with worldwide packaging expenditures reaching US$ 500 billion and sponsorship investments reaching US$ 37 billion. Evidence {{highlights the importance}} of supporting sponsorship with additional leveraging, yet little research has addressed the integrative effects of sponsorship with leveraging. This paper examines consumer response to sponsorship leveraged packaging (SLP), a marketing tool widely used in the Australian fast moving consumer goods industry. Exploratory research suggests that SLP is processed peripherally and is impacted by <b>sponsored</b> property <b>identification</b> and <b>sponsor</b> brand loyalty. With multinational corporations allocating {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} to sponsorship activity alone, it is crucial that marketers understand how to maximise their packaging and sponsorship investments.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} concern that the {{marketing}} of pharmaceutical products exerts undue influence over healthcare professionals. However, {{there is a lack of}} empirical evidence to substantiate or refute this. Furthermore, the pharmaceutical industry’s marketing strategy has evolved to a two-pronged approach, incorporating consumer-directed marketing activities alongside the more traditional direct-to-physician marketing. In response, my thesis reports on two parallel lines of research that tackles each prong. In a series of randomised controlled experiments, I have 1) sought to provide more empirical evidence for the impact of pharmaceutical promotion on healthcare professionals and 2) evaluated an educational intervention developed to combat consumer-directed disease awareness advertisements disseminated by the pharmaceutical industry. First, I attempted to replicate and advance Grande, Frosch, Perkins, and Kahn (2009) ’s work by investigating whether exposure to pharmaceutical print advertising can shift medical students’ implicit attitude towards the advertised product, such that the individual exhibits a stronger positive association with the advertised product relative to a non-advertised product. Implicit attitudes were measured using an Implicit Association Test (IAT) designed to assess the strength of association between the advertised/non-advertised product and a list of positive/negative words. I could not replicate Grande and colleagues’ (2009) findings because of difficulties recruiting enough participants. A lack of statistical power meant that I could not make any inferences or draw any conclusions with confidence. However, the experiment did illuminate methodological issues associated with the IAT. Next, I investigated the effectiveness of an educational intervention that informs the general public about industry-sponsored disease awareness campaigns and encourages the cultivation of healthy scepticism (i. e. having a critical eye when evaluating information) towards such potentially biased and misleading sources of health information. Specifically, I investigated the impact of this intervention on participants’ ability to identify the sponsor of a disease awareness advertisement, their attitudes towards such ads, their perceptions of the medical conditions discussed in the ads, their scepticism towards pharmaceutical advertising, and their behavioural intentions after viewing the ads. Across three experiments, I consistently demonstrated that the intervention increased participants’ <b>sponsor</b> <b>identification</b> accuracy and their scepticism towards pharmaceutical advertising. Healthy scepticism was consistently observed with regards to the perceived value of an ad. Participants who underwent the intervention were less likely to agree that an ad was valuable only when it was industry-sponsored. However, there was more inconsistency for measures, such as participants’ reported behavioural intentions, that required them to think through the implications of their attitude changes. Thesis (Ph.

40|$|With {{worldwide}} sponsorship spending now exceeding US 33 billion, it {{is essential}} that sponsorship investments be carefully managed to ensure their effectiveness. In the Australian FMCG industry,sponsorship leveraged packaging (SLP) is widely used to communicate sponsorship arrangements to consumers. This paper develops a research framework, specifically addressing the factors impacting effectiveness of SLP. It is hypothesized that effectiveness of SLP will be impacted by loyalty to the <b>sponsoring</b> brand and <b>identification</b> with the <b>sponsored</b> property. It is expected that this relationship will be moderated by the degree of sponsorship leverage and the perceived fit between the sponsoring brand and the sponsored property. To explore these factors, research is proposed consisting of an experiment, using a two group before and after design. ...|$|R
