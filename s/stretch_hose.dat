5000|$|The {{game was}} first shown {{at a press}} conference held during Sony's PlayStation Premiere 2007 event in Tokyo. Takahashi showed a silver <b>stretch</b> <b>hose</b> with two pink balls at the ends, {{explaining}} that it wasn't a controller, but a visual aid to help explain the game. A 30-second demonstration clip featuring the character [...] "Boy" [...] was shown.|$|E
40|$|Photograph is of a two lane {{road with}} cars stopped behind a fire hose laid across the road. Far in the {{background}} is an unidentified group of people standing near the road with the stopped cars.

5|$|As {{the fire}} was going into its sixth hour it had spread up to the 26th floor. With {{inadequate}} water pressure coming from the standpipes, firefighters <b>stretched</b> <b>hoses</b> up the building's stairwells to help fight the fire. While hoses were being taken up to the fire a sprinkler technician arrived to fix the water pressure. This improved the hose streams, but the fire had engulfed several floors {{and could not be}} contained with just hoses. By 7:00 AM, almost eleven hours into the fire, firefighters were able to get control of the fire on the 22nd through 24th floors, but {{the fire was}} still out of control on the 25th and 26th floors and was spreading upwards. Structural damage observed inside the building by firefighters and consultations with a structural engineer led to fears that the damaged floors might collapse. At 7:00 AM an order to evacuate the building was issued by Fire Commissioner Roger Ulshafer, and the building was completely evacuated by 7:30 AM. After the evacuation, the only fire suppression efforts left were water streams being directed to the building from the neighboring Girard Trust Building and One Centre Square.|$|R
50|$|Fintrol is used {{primarily}} by {{federal and state}} governments in order to eliminate invasive species in an area where resident species are threatened. Antimycin A is added drop-wise in order to reach a concentration of 25 parts per billion. These drip stations are typically used upstream in an area that is accessible to boats and traffic. In deeper bodies of water, a pump mechanism is used to disperse Antimycin A through a perforated <b>hose</b> <b>stretching</b> the length of the water column.|$|R
50|$|At the Indianapolis 500, Leonard battled with {{teammate}} Unser for the lead. Leonard {{eventually led}} for 21 laps before retiring {{with a broken}} turbocharger. Leonard then got back-to-back second-place finishes at the Rex Mays Classic 150 at Wisconsin State Fairgrounds Park Speedway and the Schaefer 500 at Pocono International Raceway; in the latter Leonard battled with Mark Donohue for the win, until Leonard <b>stretched</b> his fuel <b>hose</b> during his final pit stop. Leonard won the California 500 at Ontario Motor Speedway. Leonard clinched the championship at the next to last race of the season, the Trenton 300 at Trenton International Speedway, with a third-place finish.|$|R
25|$|The initial attack {{focused on}} {{extinguishing}} {{the fire in}} the loading dock area, with a secondary effort to search for and evacuate people inside, and prevent the fire from spreading to the showroom and warehouse. Crews entering the showroom reportedly initially encountered clear visibility with only very light puffs of smoke visible near the ceiling {{at the back of the}} showroom. Shortly thereafter, an exterior door was opened near where the fire was raging. Efforts to close the door failed, allowing the fire to enter the showroom. Firefighters were ordered to <b>stretch</b> two <b>hose</b> lines into the showroom to attack the spreading fire; however, the pre-connected hose line from one of the units was too short. This required some firefighters to again exit the building to add additional sections of hose, and left only one small handline to hold back the growing fire. At about this time, fire dispatchers advised the crews on-scene that they had received a 9-1-1 call from an employee who was trapped in the warehouse, which required some firefighters to direct their attention to the rescue. The trapped employee was eventually rescued by firefighters who breached an exterior wall to reach him.|$|R
