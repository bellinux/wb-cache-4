It was the religion that gave humanity the strongest sense of collective consciousness. Durkheim saw the {{religion as}} a force that emerged in the early hunter and gatherer societies, as the emotions collective effervescence run high in the growing groups, forcing them to act in a new ways, and giving them a sense of some hidden force driving them. Over time, as emotions became symbolized and interactions ritualized, religion became more organized, giving a rise to the division between the sacred and the profane. However, Durkheim also believed that religion was becoming less important, as it was being gradually superseded by science and the cult of an individual.|$|E

This study focuses on <b>social</b> <b>institutions</b> related to gender inequality understood as long-lasting norms, values and codes of conduct that shape gender roles, and presents evidence on why they matter for development. We derive hypotheses from existing theories and empirically test them at the cross-country level with linear regressions using the newly created <b>Social</b> <b>Institutions</b> and Gender Index (SIGI) and its subindices as measures for <b>social</b> <b>institutions.</b> We find that apart from geography, political system, religion, {{and the level of}} economic development, one has to consider <b>social</b> <b>institutions</b> related to gender inequality to better account for differences in development. Our results show that <b>social</b> <b>institutions</b> that deprive women of their autonomy and bargaining power in the household, or that increase the private costs and reduce the private returns to investments into girls, are associated with lower female education, higher fertility rates and higher child mortality.

Several themes recur throughout these writings. Dewey continually argues that education and learning are social and interactive processes, and thus the school itself is a <b>social</b> <b>institution</b> through which social reform can and should take place. In addition, he believed that students thrive {{in an environment where}} they are allowed to experience and interact with the curriculum, and all students should have the opportunity to take part in their own learning.|$|E

Identity theory, affect control theory, and the Iowa School are major programs of research in this tradition. Identity Theory and Affect Control Theory both focus on how actions control mental states, thereby manifesting the underlying cybernetic nature of the approach, evident in Mead's writings Affect Control Theory provides a mathematical model of role theory and of labeling theory.|$|E

25|$|In Rabelais and His World, {{a classic}} of Renaissance studies, Bakhtin {{concerns}} {{himself with the}} openness of Gargantua and Pantagruel; however, the book itself also serves {{as an example of}} such openness. Throughout the text, Bakhtin attempts two things: he seeks to recover sections of Gargantua and Pantagruel that, in the past, were either ignored or suppressed, and conducts an analysis of the Renaissance social system in order to discover the balance between language that was permitted and language that was not. It is by means of this analysis that Bakhtin pinpoints two important subtexts: the first is carnival (carnivalesque) which Bakhtin describes as a <b>social</b> <b>institution,</b> and the second is grotesque realism which is defined as a literary mode. Thus, in Rabelais and His World Bakhtin studies the interaction between the social and the literary, as well as the meaning of the body and the material bodily lower stratum.|$|E

The Bible was the primary religious document of the society, and it also served as the primary legal document. Church attendance was not only mandatory, but membership was socially vital.

They reject a more specific understanding of social realities in literature. An author, for example, is a social being, raised and shaped by society and is in a dialectic relationship with the audience: the audience provides recognition and an income, and the author shapes audiences' tastes and behavior. Intrinsic elements of the work, and indeed the [...] "realization of certain aesthetic values", can reflect contemporary society and its attitudes. Literature does not, however, [...] "correctly" [...] reflect society or life, and may exhibit little connection.

500|$|Vargas Llosa's style {{encompasses}} historical {{material as}} well as his own personal experiences. For example, in his first novel, The Time of the Hero, his own experiences at the Leoncio Prado military school informed his depiction of the corrupt <b>social</b> <b>institution</b> which mocked the moral standards it was supposed to uphold. Furthermore, the corruption of the book's school {{is a reflection of the}} corruption of Peruvian society at the time the novel was written. Vargas Llosa frequently uses his writing to challenge the inadequacies of society, such as demoralization and oppression by those in political power towards those who challenge this power. One of the main themes he has explored in his writing is the individual's struggle for freedom within an oppressive reality. For example, his two-volume novel Conversation in the Cathedral is based on the tyrannical dictatorship of Peruvian President Manuel A. Odría. The protagonist, Santiago, rebels against the suffocating dictatorship by participating in the subversive activities of leftist political groups. In addition to themes such as corruption and oppression, Vargas Llosa's second novel, The Green House, explores [...] "a denunciation of Peru's basic institutions", dealing with issues of abuse and exploitation of the workers in the brothel by corrupt military officers.|$|E
