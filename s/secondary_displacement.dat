40|$|Background Open wedge {{osteotomy}} with {{bone grafting}} and plate fixation {{is the standard}} procedure for the correction of malunited distal radius fractures. Bone grafts are used to increase structural stability and to enhance new bone formation. However, bone grafts are also associated with donor site morbidity, delayed union at bone-graft interfaces, size mismatch between graft and osteotomy defect, and additional operation time. Purpose The goal {{of this study was}} to assess bone healing and <b>secondary</b> fracture <b>displacement</b> in the treatment of malunited distal radius fractures without the use of bone grafting. Methods Between January 1993 and December 2013, 132 corrective osteotomies and plate fixations without bone grafting were performed for malunited distal radius fractures. The minimum follow-up time was 12 months. Primary study outcomes were time to complete bone healing and <b>secondary</b> fracture <b>displacement.</b> Preoperative and postoperative radiographs during follow-up were compared with each other, as well as with radiographs of the uninjured side. Results All 132 osteotomies healed. In two cases (1. 5 %), healing took more than 4 months, but reinterventions were not necessary. No cases of <b>secondary</b> fracture <b>displacement</b> or hardware failure were observed. Significant improvements in all radiographic parameters were shown after corrective osteotomy and plate fixation. Conclusion This study shows that bone grafts are not required for bone healing and prevention of <b>secondary</b> fracture <b>displacement</b> after corrective osteotomy and plate fixation of malunited distal radius fractures.

50|$|Yet other Affordable Housing advocates {{state the}} reverse is true, that Inclusionary Zoning can have the {{opposite}} effect and actually reduce affordable housing in a community. For example, in Los Angeles, California, inclusionary zoning apparently accelerated gentrification, as older, unprofitable buildings were razed and replaced with mostly high-rent housing, and {{a small percentage of}} affordable housing; the net result was less affordable housing. In New York, NY, inclusionary zoning allows for up to a 400% increase in luxury housing for every unit of affordable housing and for an additional 400% luxury housing when combined with the liberal use of development rights. Critics have stated the affordable housing can be directed to those making up to $200,000 through the improper use of an Area Median Income, and used as political tools by organizations tied to various politicians.

40|$|Comminution of the dorsal {{metaphysis}} is {{a relatively}} common feature of distal radius fractures. However, its effects on the radiographic outcomes of these fractures are not entirely understood. One hundred and twenty-four conservatively managed distal radius fractures were analysed retrospectively to assess the effect of dorsal metaphyseal comminution on fracture stability, especially with respect to initial displacement (minimally displaced versus displaced) and age group. Seventy-seven fractures (62 %) had radiographic evidence of dorsal comminution. The <b>secondary</b> <b>displacement</b> rate of these fractures was 75 %, compared to 45 % in non-comminuted counterparts (P 50. 001). In minimally displaced fractures, the <b>secondary</b> <b>displacement</b> rate was higher in those with dorsal comminution as compared to those without (57 % vs. 31 %, P 0. 086). Dorsal metaphyseal comminution was found in 75 % of fractures in patients 65 þ years old (P 0. 05). Among those with dorsal comminution, the <b>secondary</b> <b>displacement</b> rates were similar {{for both men and}} women (63 % vs. 79 %; P 0. 20).

30|$|Yoo et al. {{described}} the anatomical {{reconstruction of the}} CC ligaments assisted by arthroscopy, in which three bone tunnels were performed in the native origins of the CC ligaments—two tunnels in the clavicle {{and one in the}} coracoid [23]. The authors argue that making only one tunnel in the coracoid carries a low risk of iatrogenic fracture. The described technique does not involve the use of a primary mechanical stabilizer that would protect the graft during the integration process to the bone tunnels; a reason why it can be inferred that their reconstructions may be prone to distraction forces that might affect the initially obtained ACJ reduction. In fact, although the authors report satisfactory clinical results, subtle <b>secondary</b> <b>displacements</b> were observed at final follow-up in 100 % of patients in their series (13 / 13) [23].|$|R
40|$|SummaryIntroductionClosed {{reduction}} of <b>secondary</b> <b>displacements</b> of distal metaphyseal radius fractures {{is an easy}} procedure only when performed within the first ten to fifteen days post-trauma, prior to the occurrence of malunion. When a hard bony callus prevents proper reduction, an open osteotomy is generally advocated. HypothesisWe suggest {{the use of a}} less invasive technique which aims at correcting early malunion when closed reduction is made impossible: the percutaneous callus osteoclasis. Materials and methodsCallus osteoclasis consists in a series of multiple bone-drilling in a postage stamp pattern performed under image intensifier using a large diameter pin, at a distance from the growth plate. Once the bone has been weakened, reduction is obtained by using the pin as an intrafocal lever. The pin is then pushed through the opposite cortex to ensure postero-lateral stabilization. ResultsTwenty-one patients were managed using this technique and reported good results with no complications. DiscussionThis technique offers a low aggressive management of malunions and may be performed within two to six weeks after trauma. Level of evidenceLevel IV. Multicenter retrospective study...|$|R
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{long-term}} {{safety of a}} deep repository of spent nuclear fuel, upper bound estimates of seismically induced <b>secondary</b> fracture shear <b>displacements</b> are needed. For this purpose, we analyze a model including an earthquake fault, which {{is surrounded by a}} number of smaller discontinuities representing fractures on which <b>secondary</b> <b>displacements</b> may be induced. Initial stresses are applied and a rupture is initiated at a predefined hypocenter and propagated at a specified rupture speed. During rupture we monitor shear displacements taking place on the nearby fracture planes in response to static as well as dynamic effects. As a numerical tool, we use the 3 Dimensional Distinct Element Code (3 DEC) because it has the capability to handle numerous discontinuities with different orientations and at different locations simultaneously. In tests performed to benchmark the capability of our method to generate and propagate seismic waves, 3 DEC generates results in good agreement with results from both Stokes solution and the Compsyn code package. In a preliminary application of our method to the nuclear waste repository site at Forsmark, southern Sweden, we assume end-glacial stress conditions and rupture on a shallow, gently dipping, highly prestressed fault with low residual strength. The rupture generates nearly complete stress drop and an M-w 5. 6 event on the 12 km(2) rupture area. Of the 1584 secondary fractures (150 m radius), {{with a wide range of}} orientations and locations relative to the fault, a majority move less than 5 mm. The maximum shear displacement is some tens of millimeters at 200 m fault-fracture distance...|$|R
40|$|Although <b>secondary</b> <b>displacement</b> {{following}} closed {{reduction and}} plaster immobilisation is high, several guidelines still recommend non-operative treatment for displaced distal radius fractures with an adequate closed reduction. The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate functional outcomes, measured with the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire, in non-operative treated patients with displaced distal radius fractures and an adequate closed reduction confirmed on radiograph. From a retrospective database, we reviewed non-operative treated adult patients with an unilateral displaced distal radius fracture and adequate closed reduction confirmed on radiograph. The primary outcome was the DASH score at 12 months. DASH scores were prospectively collected pre-trauma and at three, six and 12 months. Secondary outcome was the number of subsequent surgeries due to <b>secondary</b> <b>displacement</b> or a symptomatic malunion, and their possible predictors. Additionally, the difference in DASH scores between patients who were treated due to <b>secondary</b> <b>displacement</b> and asymptomatic malunion was compared. One-hundred and sixteen patients were included. The median age was 62 years and 79 % was female. Fractures were classified according to the AO/OTA classification as follows: AO/OTA type A (49 %), AO/OTA type B (3 %), AO/OTA type C (48 %). After 12 months the median DASH score was 15. Forty-six (40 %) patients underwent subsequent surgery due to a <b>secondary</b> <b>displacement</b> or symptomatic malunion. No significant differences in DASH scores between patients who were treated non-operatively and patients who received subsequent surgery were found. Younger patients were more likely to undergo subsequent surgery. Patients with a symptomatic malunion had significant higher DASH scores compared to patients with <b>secondary</b> <b>displacement.</b> Non-operative treatment of displaced distal radius fractures after adequate closed reduction confirmed on radiograph leads to acceptable functional outcomes after 12 months, however, at the expense of 40 % subsequent surgeries.

30|$|Study {{findings}} show that access to the reviewed minimum standards of shelter could be a challenge for Afghan returnees. The living conditions of some Afghan returnees are so dire that their lives can be put at risk (Simpson et al. 2017). As stated by Afghan returnees themselves, shelter is their most important need and an essential element in their reintegration into Afghan society (Assessment Capacities Project 2016). It is estimated that 900, 000 people will need shelter assistance in Afghanistan in 2018 and among them are 440, 000 returnees (United States Agency for International Development [USAID] 2017). The literature suggests that {{lack of access to}} a durable shelter {{is one of the main}} reasons for the <b>secondary</b> <b>displacement</b> of Afghan returnees (Abbasi-Shavazi et al. 2005; Barr and Sanei 2013; Macdonald 2011; Schmeidl 2009; Milani 2006; Simpson et al. 2017). Estimates show that on average around 15 % of the registered returnees in Afghanistan are forced to <b>secondary</b> <b>displacement</b> (UNHCR 2012).

40|$|Beryllium is a favoured {{candidate}} for a neutron multiplier in solid breeder blankets of fusion reactors. This is mainly due to its low (n, 2 n) -reaction threshold and because of its good thermal and mechanical properties. Its behaviour under intense neutron irradiation, however, is a crucial issue for its use in future fusion reactors. Displacement damage in beryllium {{so far has been}} calculated both with data related and methodological deficiencies. First of all, {{there is a need to}} have accurate cross-section data in order to obtain reliable spectra of primary knock-on atoms (PKA's). Furthermore, there are principal restrictions of the NRT-model in general used to calculate <b>secondary</b> <b>displacements</b> initiated by PKA's. The underlying theory of damage-energy (part of kinetic energy of PKA transferred elastically to matrix atoms) according to Lindhard is strictly valid only for medium and heavy mass ions with moderate energies in targets of the same element.
