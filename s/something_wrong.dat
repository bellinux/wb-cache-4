5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) takes a {{pregnant}} Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{to the hospital}} when she doubles over in pain. There, Reyes phones him {{to ask about the}} case, but Mulder cedes to the authority of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), who is formally running the X-Files. However, Reyes says she can't call Doggett since it is about him. Meanwhile, Jeb is in a hotel room in Georgia trying to shoot himself in the head. Suddenly, he notices <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with his face; he claws at his face, peeling away the skin to reveal burning embers beneath the skin.|$|E
5|$|The {{first time}} he cheated on me, I thought there was <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with me or the relationship, but when someone makes a habit of it, you know the problem lies with him. Yet I was foolish enough {{to give him a}} second chance because he begged and pleaded, despite the fact that {{everyone}} around me said he was still straying. I guess I really wanted to believe in him. Then I actually caught him red-handed. It {{took me a while to}} get out. But having done that, nothing can make me go back.|$|E
5|$|Although {{attacks against}} living humans are rare, the spotted hyena readily feeds on human corpses. In the {{tradition}} of the Maasai and the Hadza, corpses are left in the open for spotted hyenas to eat. A corpse rejected by hyenas is seen as having <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with it, and liable to cause social disgrace, therefore {{it is not uncommon for}} bodies to be covered in fat and blood from a slaughtered ox. In Ethiopia, hyenas were reported to feed extensively on the corpses of victims of the 1960 attempted coup and the Red Terror. Hyenas habituated to scavenging on human corpses may develop bold behaviours towards living people; hyena attacks on people in southern Sudan increased during the Second Sudanese Civil War, when human corpses were readily available to them.|$|E

5|$|I've {{always been}} drawn to her story. More than anything, drawn to her {{commitment}} to what she believed in. In the face of death, she did not back down. And that is a theme that resonates with me. And women need female role models like that. There's not a lot. I mean, she was {{burned at the stake}} after leading her country to victory, after defeating the English. I mean, the idea that instead of celebrating her, they called her a heretic because she was dressed like a boy, and how could this person, this one girl, be so victorious and so clever to have the strategy and knowledge to wage, and win, a war? There must be <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with her. OK, she's a witch. Now we have to destroy her. And she didn't back down, and I admire that.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} as Mr. and Mrs. Mallard fly over various {{potential}} {{locations around the}} city of Boston, Massachusetts (United States) to start a family. Each time Mr. Mallard selects a location, Mrs. Mallard finds <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with it. Tired from their search, the mallards land at the Public Garden Lagoon to spend the night. In the morning, a swan boat passes by the mallards. The mallards mistake the swan boat for a real bird and enjoy peanuts thrown by {{the people on the}} boat. Mrs. Mallard suggests that they build their nest in the Public Garden. However, just as she says this, her husband is nearly run down by a passing bicyclist. The mallards continue their search, flying over Boston landmarks such as Beacon Hill, the Massachusetts State House, and Louisburg Square. The Mallards finally decide on an island in the Charles River. From this island, the Mallards visit a policeman named Michael on the shore, who feeds them peanuts every day.|$|E
5|$|In 1776, Edward Gibbon had {{observed}} {{that there was}} <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with the numbers and names of the imperial biographers, and that this had already been recognised by older historians who had written on that subject. A clear example was the referencing of the biographer 'Lampridius' (who was apparently writing his biographies after 324) by 'Vopiscus', who {{was meant to be}} writing his biographies in 305-6. Then in 1889, Hermann Dessau, who had become increasingly concerned by the large number of anachronistic terms, Vulgar Latin vocabulary, and especially the host of obviously false proper names in the work, proposed that the six authors were all fictitious personae, and that the work was in fact composed by a single author in the late 4th century, probably in the reign of Theodosius I. Among his supporting evidence was that the life of Septimius Severus appeared to have made use of a passage from the mid-4th-century historian Aurelius Victor, and that the life of Marcus Aurelius likewise uses material from Eutropius. In the decades following Dessau, many scholars argued to preserve {{at least some of the}} six Scriptores as distinct persons and in favor of the first-hand authenticity for the content. As early as 1890, Mommsen postulated a Theodosian 'editor' of the Scriptores work, an idea that has resurfaced many times since. Hermann Peter (editor of the Augustan History and of the Historicorum Romanorum reliquiae) proposed a date of 330 for when the work was written, based upon an analysis of style and language. Others, such as Norman H. Baynes, abandoned the early 4th century date but only advanced it as far as the reign of Julian the Apostate (useful for arguing the work was intended as pagan propaganda).|$|E

5|$|In {{the next}} episode, Mahone and Michael {{are the only}} ones left on the team. Linc and Sara are captured, and Self is in the hospital. Mahone and Michael decide it is time to bring the Company down and save everyone; they decide to go after Lincoln first. They set up a trap for Christina, but the police arrive; one of Christina's guards is killed in an {{explosion}} set up by Michael and meant for Christina. Later Michael gives Scylla to Mahone without the hard drive and has him save Lincoln, while Michael goes after Sara. Mahone has a bomb in Scylla which is large enough to kill Christina and her man, Downey. Christina has Mahone put in the same room Lincoln is in, moving Lincoln {{to the other side of}} the room. When the bomb fails to detonate and Christina realizes there is <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with Scylla, she calls on Mahone to check the device and threatens to kill him if he cannot activate it. He sets it manually. After a struggle with Christina and Downey, Mahone runs to the room where Lincoln is; the bomb detonates, killing Downey, but Christina survives. Michael and Sara come to pick up Lincoln and Mahone and head to another location, where Scylla's hard drive is. The remaining team then heads to a hospital for supplies to treat Lincoln's gunshot wound. Sara and Mahone go into the hospital, and Mahone is arrested by Federal agents. He is later freed and exonerated when Michael delivers Scylla to Kellerman. In the series' epilogue (set four years later), Mahone, Lincoln, Sucre, Michael's child and Sara visit Michael’s grave at a beach.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes, the {{problems}} with pushers and helpers arose not from the hardware but the politics and the economics. In the 1880s, the BR and the Erie shared locomotive facilities at Clarion Junction. They had an agreement that each company would provide helper service {{to each other on}} the basis of whose engine was first up at the enginehouse when a train came along needing a push. After some years of this, the BR management realized that their engines were doing most of the work. The Erie crews had acquired the knack of finding <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with their engines, keeping them conveniently immobilized {{when it was time for}} work. The agreement ended.|$|E
25|$|Westlake {{now has a}} full clock schedule: Making {{the skin}} last longer than 99 minutes, visiting Julie, {{studying}} his enemies and even mimicking their voice patterns- in order to assume their identities to cause confusion and sow dissension. This culminates in him impersonating Durant himself, causing confusion among the mobster and his henchmen. When Westlake and Julie have a date at the carnival, an altercation causes Westlake to lose his temper and inadvertently reveals to Julie that there is indeed <b>something</b> <b>wrong</b> with him. She follows him as he flees (his 99 minutes were up,) and when she discovers his discarded mask, she calls to Peyton that she still loves him regardless. Julie tells Strack she can no longer see him, and after discovering the Bellasarious Memorandum on his desk {{while he was on}} the phone, confirms he was collaborating with Durant the entire time. She reveals Westlake is still alive, but Strack tells her as long as he has the memorandum, no charges can be filed. When Julie leaves, Durant enters and is told to capture Julie and kill Westlake.|$|E
