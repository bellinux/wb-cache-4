Listening to the tapes, they agreed their material sounded {{better than they}} originally thought. They briefly {{returned to}} Berlin in January 1991 to finish their work at Hansa. Reflecting on their time in Berlin, Clayton called the sessions a [...] "baptism of fire" [...] and said, [...] "It was something {{we had to go}} through to realize {{what we were trying to}} get to was not <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> find physically, outside of ourselves, in some other city—that there was not magic to it and that we actually had to put the work in and figure out the ideas and hone those ideas down." [...] Although just two songs were delivered during their two months in Berlin, the Edge said that in retrospect, working there had been more productive and inspirational than the output had suggested. The band had been removed from a familiar environment, providing what they described as a certain [...] "texture and cinematic location", and many of their incomplete ideas would be revisited in the subsequent Dublin sessions with success.|$|E

2500|$|Initially, {{while living}} on Fire Island in the 1970s, Kramer had no {{intention}} of getting involved in political activism. There were politically active groups in New York City, but Kramer notes the culture on Fire Island was so different that they would often make fun of political activists: [...] "It was not chic. It was not <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> brag about with your friends... Guys marching down Fifth Avenue was a whole other world. The whole gestalt of Fire Island was about beauty and looks and golden men." ...|$|E

All's fair in love and war." [...] Producer Spikings, while proud of the film, regrets the way the Vietnamese were portrayed. [...] "I don't {{think any of us}} meant it to be exploitive," [...] Spikings said. [...] "But I think we were... ignorant. I can't think of a better word for it. I didn't realize how badly we'd behaved to the Vietnamese people..." ...|$|E

Sex [...] "was <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> just do {{and it was}} for free". She was [...] "13, 14" [...] and having sex with men of [...] "19, 20, 25, 26". In the film, the narration states: “It could be good, really something. I {{remember the first time}} someone asked me to grab their balls, I remember the power it gave me. But it wasn’t always like that; sometimes they’d just cum, and then they’d leave me there, wherever I was, half naked.” In the final scenes, the artist performs at a local dance competition and people begin to clap.

For Homecoming, Watts worked with a team to [...] "figure out the visual language for the action sequences and just ... you get to try stuff out before you’re actually on-set shooting it" [...] which helped Watts practice given his lack of experience working on large-scale action films. For the [...] "web-slinging" [...] sequences in the film, Watts wanted to avoid the big [...] "swoopy" [...] camera moves that had been previously used for such Spider-Man scenes and instead [...] "keep it all as grounded as possible.

Although this was denied {{by both the}} Tunku and Abdul Razak, there was great concern among non-Malays {{as to how the}} NOC's policy would affect them, as the NOC was chaired by Abdul Razak and not the Tunku. Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, later finance minister, cited Ismail as a major factor in increasing public confidence in the government, stating: [...] "The Chinese did not have much confidence in Razak, but they did in Ismail. Razak was always associated with Malay and rural affairs, et cetera. Ismail was a principled man — and was seen that way by the different races. He was the Rock of Gibraltar.

2500|$|Director Marc Webb has {{described}} the film {{as more of a}} [...] "coming of age" [...] story as opposed to a [...] "rom-com". He stated, [...] "We arrive at a different conclusion, for one thing. Plus, most romantic comedies are more loyal to a formula than to emotional truth. It's about happiness, and learning that you'll find it within yourself, rather than in the big blue eyes of the girl in the cubicle down the hall. I wanted to make an unsentimental movie and an uncynical movie. In my mind, I wanted it to be <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> dance to. That's why we put a parenthesis in the title – it's like a pop song in movie form. It's not a big film. It's not about war or poverty. It's about 500 days in a young guy's relationship, but it's no less deserving of scrutiny. When your heart is first broken, it consumes you. And it's an emotion I wanted to make a movie about, before I forgot how it felt".|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, Late Night host David Letterman was {{preparing}} to leave, prompting executive producer Lorne Michaels {{to search for a}} new host. Michaels approached O'Brien to produce; then-agent Gavin Polone stressed that O'Brien wanted to perform, rather than produce. He arranged with Michaels that O'Brien would do a test audition on the stage of The Tonight Show. Jason Alexander and Mimi Rogers were the guests, and the audience was composed of Simpsons writers. Wolodarksky recalled the experience: [...] "Seeing this friend of yours, this guy that you worked with, walk out from behind that curtain and deliver a monologue was like <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> only dream up that you couldn’t ever imagine actually happening." [...] The performance was beamed by satellite to New York, where Lorne Michaels and NBC executives watched. O'Brien was picked as the new host of Late Night on April 26, 1993. As the writers headed to the voice record for [...] "Homer Goes to College", O'Brien {{received a phone call from}} Polone informing him of the decision. [...] "He was passed out facedown into this horrible shag carpet. He was just quiet and comatose down there on that carpet," [...] recalled postproduction supervisor Michael Mendel. [...] "I remember looking at him and saying, 'Wow. Your life is about to change, in a really dramatic way.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Frusciante's musical {{style has}} evolved {{over the course of}} his career. His guitar playing employs melody and emotion rather than virtuosity. Although virtuoso {{influences}} can be heard throughout his career, he has said that he often minimizes this. Frusciante brought a more melodic and textured sound to albums such as [...] Californication (1999), By the Way (2002) and Stadium Arcadium (2006). This contrasts with his previous abrasive approach in Mother's Milk, as well as his dry, funky and more docile arrangements on Blood Sugar Sex Magik. On Californication (1999) and By the Way (2002), Frusciante derived the technique of creating tonal texture through chord patterns from post-punk guitarist Vini Reilly of The Durutti Column, and bands such as Fugazi and The Cure. On By The Way, he wanted lead guitar to be <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> sing, his guitar playing was then influenced by John McGeoch of Siouxsie and the Banshees, Johnny Marr of The Smiths and Bernard Sumner of Joy Division. He initially wanted to take another direction and [...] intended the record to be made up of [...] "these punky, rough songs", drawing inspiration from early punk artists such as The Germs and The Damned. However, this was discouraged by producer Rick Rubin, and he instead built upon Californications (1999) melodically driven style. During the recording of Stadium Arcadium (2006), he moved away from his New Wave influences and concentrated on emulating flashier guitar players such as Hendrix and Van Halen.|$|E
