Surface treatments {{act as a}} barrier between {{the environment and the}} concrete, preventing or retarding the entry of harmful substances and cutting off the transportation path into concrete. There is a linear relation between the ionic permeability of the resin and the electrolytic conductivity of the resin. Virtually all the surface protecions are permeable to water, enough to be little effective controlling the corrosion but not the ionic permeability which is much lower. It seems to be a connection between the permeability and the characteristics of the density of the crosslinking of the coating. The water (or aggressive solution) is transported trough the film in a process with several phases called permeation, which depends on two independent parameters: the solubility of the water in the polymer and its diffusivity or ability to pass trough the film, both concerning the molecular structure of the resin. The effectiveness <b>of</b> a <b>surface</b> <b>protection</b> preventing the permeation depends on how close and strongly connected are the resin molecules.

40|$|Concrete {{structures}} {{are exposed to}} carbonation that may cause rapid decay, shortening their service life and raising maintenance and repair costs. Carbonation lowers the alkalinity of the concrete depassivating the steel reinforcement. Two limit states can be identified with regard to service life. The first limit state ends when the steel is depassivated. The second limit state is based on cracking of the concrete cover due to oxides generated during corrosion. The service life includes a certain propagation period of corrosion during which the cross-sectional area of steel is progressively decreased, the bond between steel and concrete is reduced and the effective cross-sectional area of concrete is diminished due to spalling <b>of</b> the cover. <b>Surface</b> treatment is commonly used to improve the resistance of concrete to carbonation. A barrier is formed retarding the carbonation reactions {{in the interior of}} the concrete. In this study surface protected concretes were compared with non-protected concretes. The used surface protected concretes presented generally lower carbonation diffusion coefficients than the non-protected concretes. The use of epoxy resin showed better protection than the use of acrylic and siloxane resins. The composition of the concretes is an important factor affecting the diffusion of carbonation. The influence of the water–cement ratio was very important. The carbonation diffusion coefficients increased with the water–cement ratio.

40|$|Post-implant {{annealing}} of InP and GaInAs {{is usually}} accomplished using thermal cycles of 10 - 30 minutes duration; this thesis reports {{the results of}} a systematic study of an alternative technique, 'rapid thermal annealing' (RTA), in which the implanted material is held at elevated temperatures for less than 180 seconds. Results were obtained using Hall-effect measurements, Rutherford backscattering (RBS), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), and photoluminescence (PL), amongst other methods. Iron-doped InP, implanted with magnesium, zinc or mercury was subjected to RTA and five different methods of protecting the InP surface were compared: the use of an indium-tin pseudobinary leads to tin incorporation and n-type surface layer formation above 700 °C; encapsulating layers of phosphosilicate glass, SiO 2, Si 3 N 4 or a novel 'dual' layer of Si 3 N 4 /AlK may lead to p-type, semi-insulating or n-type behaviour. This is shown to be due to the indiffusion of silicon from these encapsulants into the implanted substrate; this indiffusion is enhanced by implantation damage. RTA in a phosphine ambient gives the best <b>surface</b> <b>protection</b> at elevated temperatures, but leads to substantial outdiffusion and loss of the implanted dopant. Electrically active p-type layers were successfully obtained from both zinc and mercury implants. GaInAs was implanted with beryllium, magnesium, zinc and mercury and electrically active p-type layers obtained following magnesium implantation; electrical results were, however, dominated by the quality of the starting material and not reproducible. 'Proximity' annealing under a GaAsP or GaAs cover piece gave adequate <b>surface</b> <b>protection</b> for GaInAs at annealing temperatures up to 800 °C. The presence of an amorphous layer In InP and GalnAs is shown to be detrimental and the maximum amorphous thickness which can be fully regrown is found to be about 250 nm at 750 °C. It is suggested that solid phase epitaxy of thicker amorphous layers is inhibited by the local nucleation of microcrystallites within the remaining amorphous material and a model describing the regrowth of III-V compounds is presented. Substantial redistribution of the implanted dopant occurs during RTA of InP and GalnAs, the shape of dopant profiles is modified by both the residual damage present within the material and the form <b>of</b> <b>surface</b> <b>protection</b> employed.

Now there are well-described corrosion protection systems that give 15 years <b>of</b> <b>surface</b> <b>protection</b> without much maintenance work. However, there are deterioration mechanisms that are not understood. Further research efforts are needed and new understanding should be turned into procedures for implementation. Tankers and bulk carriers are designed for about 25 years. In trans-ocean trade these ships may make as few as 300 - 1000 voyages in the lifetime. The loading and discharge cycle ballast-cargo-ballast causes high local stresses in some bracket corners and cutouts. During the ocean voyages wave loads causes high stresses in the same spots. When stresses are superimposed the yield point of the material is frequently reached and there will be local yielding in many such places. In the paper it is shown that the steel sustains high strain better than the aged coating. Spots at risk are not systematically identified today despite the very high probability of localized failure of the coating. Once the coating has failed locally corrosion starts and accelerated crack propagation takes place in the steel for the wave-induced stresses. The paper gives a state of the art description concerning corrosion protection systems and focuses on the localized strain induced coating failures, some methods under development. In order to avoid localized cracks in the coating due to high strain followed by corrosion one should identify spots with very high strain, give the local geometry of the steel below the vulnerable coating a perfect shape for the benefit of a sustainable coating...|$|R

40|$|So far direct diode lasers are {{not very}} common for laser {{cladding}} applications in the field <b>of</b> <b>surface</b> <b>protection,</b> remanufacturing and rapid prototyping, since they have a low beam quality and usually a rectangular or line shaped spot with a short working distance. However, their extreme compact size, ease of operation, high wall plug efficiency and lower investment and running costs makes them very interesting for laser cladding, especially in an industrial environment. In this study a diode laser coating process for cladding of oil drilling equipment is presented, which was developed a the Fraunhofer Center for Coatings and Laser Applications. In order to develop a simple and cost efficient system for laser cladding, a direct diode laser was modified to match the required beam profile. In the first attempt to increase the working distance and to scale the focus size, one lens of the focusing optics was removed. To further increase the spot size, the laser beam was defocused below its focal plane. In a second step the laser spot was made square in the focal plane by readjusting the diode stacks inside the laser head.

Furthermore the only dislocation observed in the (010) sector able to produce a step on the surface was characterised as having the Burgers vector. Two growth mechanisms were observed to operate on the (010) face of KAP crystals studied using AFM. On most crystals, a spiral growth mechanism was observed. On a minority of crystals a two dimensional nucleation and growth mechanism occurred at the higher range of supersaturations (above 15 %). In the case of a spiral mechanism it was generally noted that growth hillocks were dominated by a small number of non co-operating spiral sources. The spirals were all observed to be anisotropic and polygonised. The degree of polygonisation was found to vary as a function of supersaturation. The step spacing was found to have an inverse relation with the supersaturation, as predicted theoretically. From an inverse plot of step spacing against supersaturation it was possible to calculate the step edge free energies of both the fast and slower moving steps. These were 40 erg/cm" 2 and 8 erg/cm" 2 respectively.

40|$|In recent years, {{research}} projects on coating and strengthening {{products for the}} protection and conservation of building stones has been increased. In particular, cheap, eco-friendly, reversible, compatible and high activity products are under testing in order to verify their efficiency and applicability on stones. In this work we present {{the results obtained on}} the Sabucina Stone, a calcarenite outcropping in Central Sicily and widely used as building and replaced stone, by applying TiO 2 nanoparticle coatings and hybrid organic-inorganic strengthening products. The durability of the studied calcarenite determined by its structural, textural and porosimetric features, requires an integrated preservation and conservation of stone both in terms <b>of</b> <b>surface</b> <b>protection</b> and structural strengthening. First we tested self-cleaning photocatalytic coatings based on TiO 2 nanoparticles obtained by the sol-gel process at different pH values. Photocatalytic activity of theTiO 2 coatings on Sabucina Stone was assessed under daylight and ultraviolet irradiation, monitoring methyl orange (MeO) and methyl blue (MB) dye degradation as a function of time. To evaluate the effect of the treatment, colorimetric and water absorption tests were performed. Moreover, in order to verify the action of coating in inhibiting degradation processes, aging tests were carried out by evaluating stone resistance to salt crystallization. Second, a network based on aluminium and silicon oxides with epoxidic functional groups have been used with strengthening aims. In order to test the effectiveness of the hybrid organic-inorganic strengthening product, colorimetric, water adsorption, compressive strength and aging tests have been performed. Finally, the performance of a hydrophobic coating applied in association with the strengthener was verified by colorimetric and water adsorption tests. The results obtained show good photodegradation rates for titania nanosols and good protection properties, especially using the basic pH preparation. With reference to hybrid organic-inorganic strengthening products and hydrophobic coatings, preliminary tests highlight promising applications to the preservation of calcarenites...|$|R
