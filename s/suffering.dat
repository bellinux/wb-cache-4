5|$|Because Irenaeus saw {{the purpose}} of the world to be the {{development}} of the moral character of humans, he believed that a good world would be best suited to that purpose. Irenaeaus believed that this world would include some <b>suffering</b> and evil to help people draw closer to God. He perceived God's declaration in the Book of Genesis that his creation was good to mean that the world is fit for purpose, rather than being free from <b>suffering.</b> To illustrate the benefits of <b>suffering,</b> Irenaeus cited the Biblical example of Jonah, from the Book of Jonah. His <b>suffering,</b> being swallowed by a whale, both enabled God's plan to be fulfilled and also brought Jonah closer to God: Jonah ended up repenting for his sin and the people of Nineveh turn to God.|$|E

The animals are euthanized at the end of studies for sample collection or post-mortem examination; during studies if their pain or <b>suffering</b> falls into certain categories regarded as unacceptable, such as depression, infection that is unresponsive to treatment, or the failure of large animals to eat for five days; or when they are unsuitable for breeding or unwanted for some other reason.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{basically}} a study of Percy Bysshe Shelley's The Cenci. By analyzing the main female character, Beatrice Cenci, the thesis writer is interested to know how far Beatrice's <b>sufferings</b> affect her {{that she needs to}} murder her father and also why she fails all her efforts to escape from her father's cruelty. The writer intends to prove that Beatrice's <b>sufferings</b> are such that she needs to murder her father and also her failure to escape from her <b>sufferings</b> {{is the result of the}} strong patriarchal concept in the society at that time. To accomplish the objective goal of thesis, the use of characterization, setting, some psychological theories and historical review as the literary approaches is necessary. The evil character of Cenci creates the <b>sufferings</b> on Beatrice, his daughter, as Cenci continuosly abuses her physically, emotionally and sexually. As a normal human being who cannot stand such pressure, Beatrice tries to escape from her <b>sufferings</b> by doing almost anything she could. However, all of her efforts to escape fail because she is blocked by the society, law and the Church. Finally, Beatrice decides to murder Cenci to escape from her <b>sufferings.</b> Ironically, instead of ending all her <b>sufferings,</b> she is sentenced to death by the Pope in order to defend the patriarchal system in the society...|$|R
5|$|Writing in the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Michael Tooley {{rejected}} the Irenaean theodicy as unsatisfactory. He {{argued that the}} magnitude of <b>suffering</b> experienced by some people is excessive, supporting Eleanor Stump's view that the <b>suffering</b> endured by those with terminal illnesses cannot be for moral development, and that such illnesses do not fall more often upon those seemingly immoral or in need of development. He also challenged the <b>suffering</b> both of animals and of young children. Neither of these instances of <b>suffering</b> serve any useful purpose, as they cannot lead to moral development. Finally, he questioned whether the current universe is the best possible world for the moral development of humans. Citing the examples of those who die young and those who experience too great a pain to learn from it, {{as well as people}} who suffer too little to learn anything, he suggested that this world is not ideally suited to human development.|$|E

[...] In his trilogy Opbyggelige Taler i Forskellig Aand ("Edifying Discourses in Another Vein"), Kierkegaard passed from a general religious and philosophical standpoint to a specifically Christian one. The Gospel of <b>Sufferings</b> forms {{the third part}} of that trilogy, and is a central plank {{in the structure of}} Kierkegaard's mature thought. [...] "The theme these discourses is our <b>sufferings.</b> It is also the gospel that pertains to, and is appropriate to, our <b>sufferings.</b> It is in the realm of faith, and though this gospel that is the peculiar property of those who suffer, that <b>sufferings</b> are found to contain joys. We may say therefore that it is the purpose of this volume to disclose the meaning in the most meaningless element of life. Which might be held to be quite a good definition of the Christian faith." ...|$|R

Beside that, Jo?s own personality and the interfere of other characters like Bob and Giles also causes JO?S <b>sufferings.</b> The efforts that Jo has done to escape from her <b>sufferings</b> and her failure to escape are the main points that I {{want to find out}} in my discussion.

Moreover, I also include some psychological theories such as alcoholism and emotional support to explain more about the main female character?s efforts and failure. They are used as additional tools that can help me to analyze the main female character more deeply. Through the conflicts; it is found out that Jo has struggled to free herself from her <b>sufferings.</b> Through the characterization and other psychological theories; it is found out that at last the main female character fails to escape from her <b>sufferings.</b> It is concluded that Jo Armitage?s failure to escape from her <b>sufferings</b> happens because of her inability to cope with her problems which makes her suffer.
