25|$|In the event, larger nasal wounds (defects) do {{successfully}} heal by <b>secondary</b> <b>intention,</b> but do present two disadvantages. First, {{the resultant}} scar often {{is a wide}} patch of tissue that is aesthetically inferior to the scars produced with other nasal-defect correction techniques; however, {{the skin of the}} medial canthus is an exception to such scarring. The second disadvantage to healing by <b>secondary</b> <b>intention</b> is that the contracture of the wound might distort the normal nasal anatomy, which can lead to a pronounced deformity of the alar rim area. For this reason, healing by <b>secondary</b> <b>intention</b> generally is not recommended for defects of the distal third of the nose; nonetheless, the exception is a small wound directly upon the nasal tip.|$|E

40|$|Quality is {{nowadays}} {{an important}} issue {{to be applied to}} everything. The evaluation of the quality standards is sometimes an obsession extended to all the human activities. Sometimes these criteria could hide other <b>secondary</b> <b>intentions</b> avoiding certain competitiveness. The second half of the last century was characterized by the expansion of the teaching Institutions according to the demographic explosion in almost all the planet, especially in the emerging countries. The progressive urban concentration helped to the democratization of the education as an engine to ensure the progress of the several cultures. The final step of this process is arriving with the application of e-learning processes where problems of territorial motilities are avoided. After this proliferation, with different quality results, the responsible Institutions have decided to apply the quality criteria. High Education (HE) Institutions are affected by this crescent preoccupation. This paper tries to analyze some of the different processes developed by Official and Professional institutions in Europe and Eastern Mediterranean countries along the last two decades. The homogenization of these process is the main characteristic in Europe, because the Bologna process. Several experiences previously developed were harmonized and adapted for the Bologna grid. The initial intentions from the Professional Associations to control this process were forwarded to the respective National Agencies. The roles of the professional associations were progressively deactivated. In Eastern Mediterranean countries the experience is leaded by the British and USA Institutions. The work is about the evaluation of the Schools of Architecture and its comparative analysis cover different case studies in three southern European countries (Portugal, Spain and Italy) and Lebanon. The author tries to define the changes these processes have experimented. The conclusions must show the similarities and disparities and discuss about the rationality of these processes when applied to different cultures. It seems that the criteria for the evaluation must pay attention to the specificities, cultural and economic conditions of the different faculties to be evaluated. The globalization of some of these processes can be a trouble to respect the singularities of the different systems...|$|R

It is argued that these provide useful insights into the widely discussed categories of speaker's intentions (e. g. a priori versus post facto intentions, private i-intentions versus shared we-intentions). First of all, " ironic meaning " is viewed as comprising a set of different types of meaning, including a bundle of implicatures that can be hierarchically ranked in terms of both communicative priority and inferential priority. Secondly, examples of different degrees of manifestness of the ironist's intentions are discussed in light of the communicative complexities of irony, which is viewed as a higher-order phenomenon. The final discussion attempts to bring together the analyses of the speaker's and the hearer's perspectives, contributing to a dynamic model of ironic discourse...|$|R

25|$|To {{correct a}} defect {{of the nasal}} lining of the upper two-thirds of the nose, the wound {{dimensions}} (length, width, depth) determine the technique. A nasal-lining defect of less than 5nbsp&mm in diameter can be closed primarily, with sutures. A nasal-lining defect 5–15nbsp&mm in diameter can be closed with a random transposition flap harvested from a nasal area that remains protected, either by the nasal bones or by the upper lateral cartilages; and the flap donor-site can be healed by <b>secondary</b> <b>intention,</b> re-epithelialisation.

For a wound wider than 15mm—especially a wound that comprehends the alar lobule and the lateral wall of the nose—primary closure is not indicated, because such a wound closure imposes {{excessive}} stresses upon the skin flap, thereby risking either blanching (whitening) or distortion, or both. Such risks are avoided by advancing (moving) {{the skin of the}} cheek towards the nasofacial junction, where it is sutured to the deep tissues.

The essentials of my development of García Landa’s model García Landa 1990 and 1998 understands communication through speech as the production of speech perceptions that he calls linguistic percepts (symbolised as LPs 2). Let me remind us what he means: what a speaker means to say, his vouloir dire or meaning meant, comes to his conscience as a linguistic percept intended (LPI), that is, as it were, an “amalgam ” of propositional and pragmatic content moulded by and articulated as speech. Such perception of what a person wishes to communicate to himself or others {{does not come from}} nowhere or for no reason at all: it is always the product of a conscious motivation governed by the speaker’s unconscious as a certain orientedness towards his addressee 3 (which I symbolise respectively as W and Z) governing a main and a host of <b>secondary</b> pragmatic <b>intentions</b> (Yy).

40|$|Background: Patients with {{irritable}} bowel syndrome (IBS) {{often feel}} they {{have some form of}} dietary intolerance and frequently try exclusion diets. Tests attempting to predict food sensitivity in IBS have been disappointing but none has utilised IgG antibodies. Aims: To assess the therapeutic potential of dietary elimination based on the presence of IgG antibodies to food. Patients: A total of 150 outpatients with IBS were randomised to receive, for three months, either a diet excluding all foods to which they had raised IgG antibodies (enzyme linked immunosorbant assay test) or a sham diet excluding the same number of foods but not those to which they had antibodies. Methods: Primary outcome measures were change in IBS symptom severity and global rating scores. Non-colonic symptomatology, quality of life, and anxiety/depression were <b>secondary</b> outcomes. <b>Intention</b> to treat analysis was undertaken using a generalised linear model. Results: After 12 weeks, the true diet resulted in a 10 % greater reduction in symptom score than the sham diet (mean difference 39 (95 % confidence intervals (CI) 5 - 72); p = 0. 024) with this value increasing to 26 % in fully compliant patients (difference 98 (95 % CI 52 - 144); p< 0. 001). Global rating also significantly improved in the true diet group as a whole (p = 0. 048, NNT = 9) and even more in compliant patients (p = 0. 006, NNT = 2. 5). All other outcomes showed trends favouring the true diet. Relaxing the diet led to a 24 % greater deterioration in symptoms in those on the true diet (difference 52 (95 % CI 18 - 88); p = 0. 003). Conclusion: Food elimination based on IgG antibodies may be effective in reducing IBS symptoms and is worthy of further biomedical research...|$|R
40|$|Two of {{the most}} {{effective}} health behaviours with regard to HIV prevention are condom use and sexual abstinence. While determinants of condom use among sub-Saharan African adolescents have been studied extensively, factors related to abstinence have received far less attention. This study identified socio-cognitive determinants of primary and <b>secondary</b> abstinence <b>intentions</b> and of early sexual activity. This study also assessed whether these factors had a direct or indirect association with intentions to abstain from sex. A longitudinal design was used in which 1670 students (age 12 - 16) of non-private South African high schools filled in a questionnaire, with a follow-up after 6 months, concerning sexual abstinence, attitudes, social norms, self-efficacy, risk perception and knowledge. Logistic and linear regression analysis with latent factors was used to assess determinants of intentions and abstinence, and structural equation modelling was used to assess indirect effects. Results showed that among sexually inactive students, social norms predicted the intention to abstain from sex in the next 6 months. Among sexually active students, reporting less disadvantages of abstinence predicted the intention to abstain. Sexual activity at follow-up was predicted by attitudes and intention among sexually inactive girls, and by knowledge among sexually inactive boys. No predictors were found for sexually active adolescents. Structural equation modelling further showed that risk perception was indirectly related to intentions to abstain from sexual intercourse. We conclude that addressing socio-cognitive factors in order to motivate adolescents to delay sex {{is more likely to be}} successful before they experience sexual debut. In addition, this study shows that the effect of increasing risk perceptions, a strategy often applied by parents and HIV prevention programmes, is to a large extent mediated by more proximal cognitive factors such as attitude.
