50|$|The blue-winged kookaburra hunts {{and eats}} {{a great variety}} of animals that live on or close to the ground. In the summer wet season, insects, lizards and frogs make up a higher {{proportion}} of their diet, while they eat arthropods such as crayfish, <b>scorpions,</b> spiders, <b>fish,</b> earthworms, small birds and rodents at other times.

40|$|Despite {{its wide}} range and {{abundance}} on certain habitats, the crab-eating raccoon Procyon cancrivorus (G. Cuvier, 1798) {{is considered one}} of the less known Neotropical carnivore species. In the present study we analyzed the diet of P. cancrivorus in a peat forest and in an estuarine island in southernmost Brazil. Fruits of the gerivá palm tree Syagrus romanzoffiana were the most consumed item in the peat forest, followed by insects and mollusks. Small mammals, followed by Bromelia antiacantha (Bromeliaceae) fruits and brachyuran crustaceans were the most frequent items in the estuarine island. Other items found in lower frequencies were Solanum sp., Psidium sp., Smilax sp. and Dyospiros sp. fruits, diplopods, <b>scorpions,</b> <b>fishes,</b> anuran amphibians, reptiles (black tegu lizard and snakes), birds and medium-sized mammals (white-eared opossum, armadillo and coypu). Levin’s index values (peat forest: 0. 38; estuarine island: 0. 45) indicate an approximation to a median position between a specialist and a well distributed diet. Pianka’s index (0. 80) showed a considerable diet similarity between the two systems. Procyon cancrivorus presented a varied diet in the studied areas and may play an important role as seed disperser on coastal environments in southernmost Brazil...|$|R

2500|$|Because {{channels}} {{underlie the}} nerve impulse and because [...] "transmitter-activated" [...] channels mediate conduction across the synapses, channels are especially prominent {{components of the}} nervous system. Indeed, numerous toxins that organisms have evolved for shutting down the nervous systems of predators and prey (e.g., the venoms produced by spiders, <b>scorpions,</b> snakes, <b>fish,</b> bees, sea snails, and others) work by modulating ion channel conductance and/or kinetics. In addition, ion channels are key components {{in a wide variety}} of biological processes that involve rapid changes in cells, such as cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle contraction, epithelial transport of nutrients and ions, T-cell activation and pancreatic beta-cell insulin release. In the search for new drugs, ion channels are a frequent target.|$|R

50|$|Cape genets feed {{mostly on}} rodents such as African vlei rats, rock rats, mice and birds. Also seeds, leaves and grass {{was found in}} their stomachs, as well as beetles, grasshoppers, crickets, locusts and termites.They find most of their prey in low bushes and leaf litter, {{including}} African climbing mice, multimammate mice and African dormice. They {{are considered to be}} opportunistic omnivores, since they also catch and feed on insects, spiders, <b>scorpions,</b> and scavenge <b>fish</b> on the beach. Eating grass may aid digestion, dislodge hair in the intestines, induce vomiting to get rid of ingested toxins, relieve throat inflammation and stomach irritation. Birds appear to not be prevalent their diet.|$|R
5|$|The short-tail {{stingray}} forages {{for food}} both {{during the day}} and at night. It feeds primarily on benthic bony fishes and invertebrates, such as molluscs and crustaceans. The lateral line system on its underside allows it to detect the minute water jets produced by buried bivalves and spoon worms, which are then extracted via suction; the excess water is expelled through the spiracles. Fishes and invertebrates from open water, including salps and hyperiid amphipods, are also eaten in significant quantities. Off South Africa, this ray has been observed patrolling the egg beds of the chokka squid (Loligo vulgaris reynaudii) during mass spawnings, capturing squid that descend to the bottom to spawn. The short-tail stingray has few predators due to its size; these include the copper shark (Carcharhinus brachyurus), the smooth hammerhead (Sphyrna zygaena), the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), and the killer whale (Orcinus orca). When threatened, it raises its tail warningly over its back like a <b>scorpion.</b> Smaller <b>fishes</b> have been observed using swimming rays for cover while hunting their own prey. Known parasites of this species include the nematode Echinocephalus overstreeti, and the monogeneans Heterocotyle tokoloshei and Dendromonocotyle sp.|$|R

50|$|During the Cambrian, {{the land}} masses now {{composing}} the United States were separate and {{located in the}} southern hemisphere. Trilobites are the most characteristic animal of the time, and are especially abundant in Utah. Ordovician America was still home {{to a wide variety}} of marine invertebrates. An important fauna was preserved in the states of Indiana, Kentucky, and Ohio in the Cincinnati region. Life in Silurian America was especially diverse around the coral reefs of Indiana. It was also the time of New York's famous sea <b>scorpion,</b> Eurypterus. <b>Fishes</b> diversified greatly during the Devonian. On land the first known seed plants appeared in Pennsylvania and some of the world's first forests appeared in New York. Mississippian America was once more covered in seas, now notably home to abundant crinoids. During the Pennsylvanian America was largely terrestrial and vast swamps expanded across the country which were home to amphibians. Reptiles were appearing around this time. Into the Permian the continents had collided uniting into a single supercontinent called Pangaea. Much of the country was dry. Precursors to mammals like Dimetrodon and Edaphosaurus lived in Texas. At the end of the Permian the largest mass extinction in earth's history occurred, killing some 96% of species on the planet.|$|R
40|$|The fauna of Saudi Arabia {{comprises}} a {{large number}} of venomous species of snakes, <b>fish,</b> <b>scorpions,</b> insects, coelenterates and molluses. The venoms of these animals show a remarkable diversity of actions on human tissues. Neurotoxins (for example, from the Arabian cobra Naja haje arabica) interrupt transmission at peripheral neuromuscular junctions or (for example scorpion neurotoxins) stimulate voltage sensitive synaptic sodium and potassium channels with release of acetylcholine and catecholamines. The venoms of Red Sea carnivorous marine snails (genus Conus) contain 'conotoxins' which have effects on voltage sensitive calcium and sodium channels, acetylcholine receptors, the vasopressin receptor and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Of particular interest are sarafotoxins from the venom of the burrowing asp (Atractaspis engaddensis, Atractaspididae), which cause coronary artery vasoconstriction and atrioventricular block. They are homologous with human endogenous endothelins. Human victims of bites by this species may die very rapidly after developing anaphylactic/autonomic symptoms, shock and atrioventricular conduction abnormalities. Improved ovine Fab fragment antivenoms are being developed for treatment of envenoming by Saudi Arabian snakes and scorpions. These Fab antivenoms have the pharmacological advantage of more rapid tissue distribution, a larger apparent volume of distribution and less risk of Fc or aggregate-induced complement activation than conventional F (ab 1) 2 antivenoms...|$|R
