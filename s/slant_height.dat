25|$|A nearly similar pyramid shape, {{but with}} {{rational}} proportions, {{is described in}} the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus (the source of {{a large part of}} modern knowledge of ancient Egyptian mathematics), based on the 3:4:5 triangle; the face slope corresponding to the angle with tangent 4/3 is 53.13 degrees (53 degrees and 8 minutes). The <b>slant</b> <b>height</b> or apothem is 5/3 or 1.666... times the semi-base. The Rhind papyrus has another pyramid problem as well, again with rational slope (expressed as run over rise). Egyptian mathematics did not include the notion of irrational numbers, and the rational inverse slope (run/rise, multiplied by a factor of 7 to convert to their conventional units of palms per cubit) was used in the building of pyramids.|$|E
25|$|In 1859, the pyramidologist John Taylor claimed that, in the Great Pyramid of Giza, {{the golden}} ratio is {{represented}} by the ratio of the length of the face (the slope height), inclined at an angle θ to the ground, to half the length of the side of the square base, equivalent to the secant of the angle θ. The above two lengths were about 186.4 and 115.2 meters respectively. The ratio of these lengths is the golden ratio, accurate to more digits than either of the original measurements. Similarly, Howard Vyse, according to Matila Ghyka, reported the great pyramid height 148.2 m, and half-base 116.4 m, yielding 1.6189 for the ratio of <b>slant</b> <b>height</b> to half-base, again more accurate than the data variability.|$|E

Local pressure distributions and total aerodynamic {{forces on the}} arrays are shown. Design loads are presented to cover the conditions of array angles relative to the ground from 20 deg to 60 deg, variable array spacings, a ground clearance gap up to 1. 2 m (4 ft) and array <b>slant</b> <b>heights</b> of 2. 4 m (8 ft) and 4. 8 m (16 ft). Several means of alleviating the wind loads on the arrays are detailed. The expected reduction of the steady state wind velocity {{with the use of}} fences as a load alleviation device are indicated to be in excess of a factor of three for some conditions. This yields steady state wind load reductions as much as a factor of ten compared to the load incurred if no fence is used to protect the arrays. This steady state wind load reduction is offset by the increase in turbulence due to the fence but still an overall load reduction of 2. 5 can be realized. Other load alleviation devices suggested are the installation of air gaps in the arrays, blocking the flow under the arrays and rounding the edges of the array. A wind tunnel test plan to supplement the theoretical study and to evaluate the load alleviation devices is outlined...|$|R

30|$|In the {{equatorial}} region, the most frequently-observed type of Es layer {{is the type}} “q” (equatorial). Despite {{the fact that this}} kind of signature in the ionograms does not indicate a layer in the sense of resulting in an enhancement of the electron density, and does not block signals reflected at the upper regions, it is classified as an Es layer in ionosphere research based on ionosondes (Piggot and Rawer, 1972). Indeed, the Esq layer is associated with equatorial electrojet (EEJ) current instabilities (Fejer and Kelley, 1980; Forbes, 1981). The signatures of the Esq layers in ionograms appears as a scattering of the ionosonde signal covering most of the frequency scale, and occurs during daylight time. Knecht and Mcduffie (1969) showed that the Esq can be detected over a distance of about 700 km in latitude around the magnetic equator, which agrees with the width of {{the equatorial}} geomagnetic field enhancements observed with a magnetometer. However, {{it must be noted that}} Esq layers may be observed simultaneously with other Es layers, such as the type “s” (slant), which are <b>slants</b> (in <b>height)</b> that emerge in the original layer trace (Cohen et al., 1962).

The learning process inherent in Neural Networks (NN) {{can be applied to}} the process of verifying handwritten signatures that are electronically captured via a stylus. This paper presents a method for verifying handwritten signatures by using NN architecture.

Several Network topologies are tested and their accuracy is compared. Although the verification process can be thought to as a monolith component, it is recommended to divide it into loosely coupled phases (like preprocessing, feature extraction, feature matching, feature comparison and classification) allowing us to gain a better control over the precision of different components. This paper focuses on classification, the last phase in the process, covering some of the most important general approaches in the field. Each approach is evaluated for applicability in signature verification, identifying their strength and weaknesses. It is shown, that some of these weak points are common between the different approaches and can partially be eliminated with our proposed solutions.

5000|$|An all-new clean sheet {{redesign}} of General Motors' Chevrolet and GMC brand C/K-Series pickups débuted in mid-1972 for the 1973 model year. Development {{of the new}} third-generation trucks began in 1968 with vehicle components undergoing simulated testing on computers before the first prototype pickups were even built for real world testing. The redesign was revolutionary in appearance at the time, particularly the cab, departing from typical American pickup truck designs of the era. Aside from being near twins, the Chevrolet and GMC pickups looked like nothing else on the road. The third-generation trucks are colloquially known as the [...] "Square-body" [...] or [...] "Box-body" [...] generation. GM's official [...] "Rounded-Line" [...] moniker highlighted the pickup's rounded styling cues that were incorporated into the design. This included rounded windshield corners, rounded corners of the cab roof, rounded-corner doors which cut high into the cab roof eliminating roof <b>height,</b> <b>slanted</b> front fenders, and rounded pickup box corners which allowed for rounded wraparound taillamps, a first for GM pickups. The design also featured strong distinctive curved shoulderlines which rounded out below the beltline. The curved shoulderline continued across the back tailgate on Chevrolet Fleetside and GMC Wideside models. However, the low slope of the hood and rectangular {{front end of the}} truck originated the [...] "square/box-body" [...] nickname, which was propagated through truck magazines and word of mouth.|$|R
40|$|AbstractLi and Zaidi (Li, A., and Zaidi, Q. (2000) Vision Research, 40, 217 – 242) {{showed that}} the veridical {{perception}} of the 3 -dimensional (3 D) shape of a corrugated surface from texture cues is entirely dependent on the visibility of critical patterns of oriented energy. These patterns are created by perspective projection of surface markings oriented along lines of maximum 3 D curvature. In images missing these orientation modulations, observers confused concavities with convexities, and leftward slants with rightward slants. In this paper, it is shown that these results were {{a direct consequence of}} the physical information conveyed by different oriented components of the texture pattern. For texture patterns consisting of single gratings of arbitrary spatial frequency and orientation, equations are derived from perspective geometry that describe the local spatial frequency and orientation for any <b>slant</b> at any <b>height</b> above and below eye level. The analysis shows that only gratings oriented within a few degrees of the axis of maximum curvature exhibit distinct patterns of orientation modulations for convex, concave, and leftward and rightward slanted portions of a corrugated surface. All other gratings exhibit patterns of frequency and orientation modulations that are distinct for curvatures {{on the one hand and}} slants on the other, but that are nearly identical for curvatures of different sign, and nearly identical for slants of different direction. The perceived shape of surfaces was measured in a 5 AFC paradigm (concave, convex, leftward slant, rightward slant, and flat-frontoparallel). Observers perceived all five shapes correctly only for gratings oriented within a few degrees of the axis of maximum curvature. For all other oriented gratings, observers could distinguish curvatures from slants, but could not distinguish signs of curvature or directions of slant. These results demonstrate that human observers utilize the shape information provided by texture components along both critical and non-critical orientations...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{addresses}} {{the application of}} multiple classifier systems (MCS) methods {{in the domain of}} handwriting recognition. To evaluate the MCS methods two different state-of-the-art handwritten word recognizers are used. Both recognizers are based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and process handwritten words in the same manner: First the word image is normalized in respect to <b>slant,</b> skew and <b>height.</b> Then a sequence of feature vectors is extracted from the image. Finally the HMMs are used to determine the most likely word class from a set of candidate word classes. As the performance of every MCS method depends on the performance of the classifiers it is applied to, the optimization of the recognizers is also addressed in the thesis. There are mainly two kind of MCS methods: The ensemble methods which create several classifiers out of one base classifier and the combination schemes which combine the output of several classifiers to a single output. Both kind of methods are addressed in the thesis. Also the optimal values of the parameters of the MCS methods, such as the number of classifiers created by the ensemble methods, are evaluated in the thesis. There are two objectives of the thesis. The first objective is to the design new MCS methods and the second objective is to evaluate some classic and the new MCS methods in large scale experiments. Four new categories of ensemble methods and two new combination schemes are proposed in the thesis. In addition the adaption of some classic combination schemes for the use with HMM classifiers is addressed. All methods are tested in a handwritten word recognition task where the recognizer, given an image of a word, has to choose a word from 3997 possible word classes...|$|R

40|$|Quantitative {{predictions}} of egocentric distance and geographical slant perception may {{be derived from}} dense coding (scale expansion) in angular variables (Durgin 2 ̆ 6 Li, 2011). In particular, distance/height matching tasks can {{be accounted for by}} measured biases in perceived direction (elevation) relative to the horizon (Li et al., 2011). However, substantial interest has accumulated for studies arguing that perception is affected by physiological factors such as BMI and age. We used a cross-sectional methodology to look at space perception across the adult lifespan (ages 18 - 72). We examined performance in several distance, <b>height,</b> and <b>slant</b> tasks including estimation and perceptual matching. We also measured factors concerning specialized knowledge (golfers and skiers know more about distance and slope estimation, respectively), physiology (age, BMI), and personality (e. g., Agreeableness) that might influence performance. Participants (N= 106) included college students (N= 58), but also non-student members of the nearby community (N= 48). Consistent with coding efficiency theory, <b>slant,</b> distance and <b>height</b> estimates closely accord with the angular expansion account: Distances were underestimated (0. 72 of actual distance); height was overestimated (1. 11 of actual height) and egocentric distance-height matching performance (mean ratio: 1. 53) accorded well with the ratio between estimate ratios (i. e., 1. 54). Contrary to the action-ability hypothesis, participants defined as obese by CDC guidelines (mean BMI = 35. 2) tended to underestimate distance more than those defined as normal. Slant overestimates were consistent with scale expansion, but were also affected reliably both by knowledge and by age. Although obese adults tended to give higher slant estimates, the reliable effect of age on slant estimation was opposite to the {{predictions of}} action ability (older adults gave lower slant estimates). Whereas some aspects of the slant results could be used to support an action-ability account, the data as a whole contradict the action-ability account.

30|$|Handwriting {{refers to}} the style of writing textual {{documents}} with a writing instrument such as a pen or pencil by a person. Characteristics of handwriting include the following: (1) specific shapes of letters, e.g., their roundness or sharpness; (2) regular or irregular spacing between letters; (3) {{the slope of the}} letters; (4) the rhythmic repetition of the elements or arrhythmia; (5) the pressure to the paper; and (6) the average size of letters. Because each person’s handwriting is unique, {{it can be used to}} verify a document’s writer. Therefore, writer identification has been recently studied in a wide variety of applications, such as security, financial activity, and forensics and has been used for access control. Writer identification is the task of determining the writer of a document among different writers. Writer identification methods can be categorized into two types: text-dependent methods and text-independent methods. In text-dependent methods, a writer has to write the same fixed text to perform identification, but in text-independent methods, any text may be used to establish the identity of the writer. These methods can be performed on-line, where dynamic information about the writing is available, or off-line, where only a scanned image of the writing is available. Recently, different approaches for writer identification have been proposed. A scientific validation of the individuality of handwriting was performed in [22]. In that study, handwriting samples from 1500 individuals, representative of the US population with respect to gender, age, ethnic groups, etc., were obtained. The writer can be identified based on macro-features and micro-features that were extracted from handwritten documents. The authors in [23] proposed a global approach based on multi-channel Gabor filtering, where each writer’s handwriting is regarded as a different texture. Bensefia et al. [24] used local features based on graphemes extracted from segmentations of cursive handwriting. In addition, writer identification has been performed by a textual-based information retrieval model. The work in [25] presented a new approach using a connected-component contour codebook and its probability density function. In addition, combining connected-component contours with an independent edge-based orientation and curvature PDF yields very high correct identification rates. Schlapbach and Bunke [26] proposed an HMM-based approach for writer identification and verification. In [27], the authors used a combination of directional, grapheme, and run-length features to improve writer identification and verification performance. Other studies used chain code and global features for writer identification [28]. Both proposed methods are applicable to cursive handwriting and have practical feasibility for writer identification. Other applications including such as off-line handwriting recognition systems for different languages reached up to 99 % for handwritten characters [29]. For handedness detection our earlier study proved that it can work [30]. Authors in [25] evaluated the performance of edge-based directional probability distributions as features in comparison to a number of non-angular features. [31] extracted a set of features from handwritten lines of text. The features extracted correspond to visible characteristics of the extracted feature score writing, such as the width, <b>slant,</b> and <b>height</b> of the three main writing zones. In [32], a new feature vector was employed by means of morphologically processing the horizontal profiles of the words. Because of the lack of a standard database for writer identification, a comparison of the previous studies is not possible. Because our purpose is to introduce an automatic method and because no limitation on handwriting is considered, methods that need no segmentation or connected-component analysis are regarded. Most previous studies are based on English documents with the assumption that the written text is fixed (text-dependent methods), and no research has been reported on English and Arabic texts or Arabic documents. In this paper, we propose a new method that is text-independent for off-line writer identification based on English/Arabic handwriting. Based on the idea that was presented in [23], we assume handwriting as a texture image, and a set of new features are extracted from preprocessed images of documents.|$|R
