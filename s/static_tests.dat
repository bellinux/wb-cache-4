40|$|In {{order to}} improve trainees’ {{operational}} quality of <b>static</b> <b>test</b> of guidance station of one antiaircraft missile, a <b>static</b> <b>testing</b> simulator is necessary to gain the goal. It {{is obvious that the}} key problem of developing the simulator is how to generate the <b>static</b> <b>testing</b> signals of the simulator. Aiming to solve the problem, at first, the paper adopts a standard called signal testing definition(STD), which is applied to describe simulating signals used for <b>static</b> <b>testing</b> simulation of guidance station of one antiaircraft missile; then those simulating signals for the <b>static</b> <b>testing</b> simulation are implemented based on the platform Labwindows/CVI, and D/A converters are employed for generating physical <b>static</b> <b>testing</b> signals, which are outputted through operational panels or interfaces of the <b>static</b> <b>testing</b> simulator.

25|$|Goddard {{was able}} to flight-test many of his rockets, but many {{resulted}} in what the uninitiated would call failures, usually resulting from engine malfunction or loss of control.

25|$|The A119 {{designation}} {{was first}} {{applied to a}} proposed 11-seat stretched version of the A109 in the 1970s; however this concept did not emerge and no such rotorcraft actually built. The helicopter that was eventually to enter production as the A119 was conceived in 1994, as Agusta was recovering from a period of financial woes that had nearly put the company out of business. In February 1995, the second of two prototypes conducted its first flight. The first prototype was used for <b>static</b> <b>tests.</b> Civil certification was originally anticipated in 1997, this deadline was missed allegedly due to multiple issues such as personnel problems, the need to concentrate resources {{on the development of}} the A109 Power, and further development to increase the aircraft's performance to meet customer expectations.|$|E
25|$|Compared {{to other}} cargo {{aircraft}} then coming into service, the C-76 was already obsolescent, even allowing for its war-priority method of construction. In addition, the C-76 failed {{a number of}} critical flight tests. It was discovered in testing that the C-76 was unstable when not carrying a cargo load; {{in order to obtain}} a stable center of gravity, the plane had to be ballasted beyond its maximum permissible gross takeoff weight. At any speed, or in any gusting wind, the C-76's elevators would flap back and forth violently. The wing structure failed in eight separate <b>static</b> <b>tests,</b> sometimes with a load as low as 40% of the wing's rated capacity. The wing failures were attributed by some sources to the failure of the fasteners used to secure the wood components of the aircraft. Numerous additional fasteners, metal stirrups, and wood ply reinforcements were added to the structure in an effort to strengthen it, thereby increasing the plane's overall weight.|$|E
500|$|Development of the I-3 {{began in}} mid-1926 after {{investigations}} into {{the loss of the}} Polikarpov DI-1 were completed. Although the new biplane shared many of the characteristics of the earlier design, including the staggered sesquiplane layout of the wings, it was a new design. It was designed by the OSS ( [...] — Landplane Department) of Aviatrest (Aviation Trust) under the supervision of Nikolai Nikolaevich Polikarpov, head designer of the department. There was much debate within the OSS about the proper powerplant for the new fighter, but Polikarpov rejected the Wright Tornado radial engine and decided in favor of the BMW VI liquid-cooled V12 engine. A wooden mock-up was completed in April 1927, but formal approval of the design did not come until 3 June 1927. <b>Static</b> <b>tests</b> of a full-sized model began in October {{at the same time as}} negotiations for a license for the BMW engine were finished.|$|E

2500|$|The Curtiss-Wright C-76 Caravan (company {{designation}} CW-27) was an American all-wood military [...] transport aircraft. The C-76 {{was intended}} as a substitute standard aircraft in the event of expected wartime shortages of light alloys.

2500|$|At the Clark physics lab, Goddard {{conducted}} <b>static</b> <b>tests</b> {{of powder}} rockets to measure their thrust and efficiency. He found his earlier estimates to be verified; powder rockets were converting only about 2 {{percent of their}} fuel into thrust. At this point he applied de Laval nozzles, which were generally used with steam turbine engines, and these greatly improved efficiency. (Of the several definitions of rocket efficiency, Goddard measured in his laboratory what is today called the internal efficiency of the engine: {{the ratio of the}} kinetic energy of the exhaust gases to the available thermal energy of combustion, expressed as a percentage.) By mid-summer of 1915, Goddard had obtained an average efficiency of 40 percent with a nozzle exit velocity of [...] Connecting a combustion chamber full of gunpowder to various converging-diverging expansion nozzles, Goddard was able in <b>static</b> <b>tests</b> to achieve engine efficiencies of more than 63% and exhaust velocities of over 7000 feet (2134 meters) per second. Few would recognize it at the time, but this little engine was a major breakthrough. These experiments suggested that rockets could be made powerful enough to escape Earth and travel into space. This engine, and subsequent experiments sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution, were the beginning of modern rocketry and, ultimately, space exploration. Goddard realized, however, that it would take the more efficient liquid propellants to reach space.|$|E

From 1949 until 1954, Daniel worked at Aerojet designing, building and installing transducers for control, feedback and measurement of rockets during flight and <b>static</b> <b>tests.</b> From 1954 onward, Fry helped build the Crescent Engineering & Research Company into a multimillion-dollar company along with the founder, Edmund Vail Sawyer, eventually becoming the Vice President of Research and a stockholder.

40|$|Space Shuttle Reusable Solid Rocket Motors (RSRM) are <b>static</b> <b>tested</b> at two ATK Thiokol Propulsion {{facilities}} in Utah, T- 24 and T- 97. The newer T- 97 <b>static</b> <b>test</b> facility was recently upgraded to allow thrust measurement capability. All previous <b>static</b> <b>test</b> motor thrust measurements {{have been taken}} at T- 24; data from these tests were used to characterize thrust parameters and requirement limits for flight motors. Validation of the new T- 97 thrust measurement system is required prior to use for official RSRM performance assessments. Since thrust cannot be measured on RSRM flight motors, flight motor measured chamber pressure and a nominal thrust-to-pressure relationship (based on <b>static</b> <b>test</b> motor thrust and pressure measurements) are used to reconstruct flight motor performance. Historical <b>static</b> <b>test</b> and flight motor performance data are {{used in conjunction with}} production subscale test data to predict RSRM performance.

Therefore, an accurate nominal thrust-to-pressure (F/P) relationship is critical for accurate RSRM flight motor performance and Space Shuttle analyses. Flight Support Motors (FSM) 7, 8, and 9 provided thrust data for the validation of the T- 97 thrust measurement system.
