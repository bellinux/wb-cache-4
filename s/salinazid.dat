40|$|The {{design and}} {{synthesis}} of mechanically responsive materials is interesting because they are potential candidates to convert thermal energy into mechanical work. Reported in this paper are thermosalient effects {{in a series of}} halogen derivatives of salinazids. The chloro derivative, with higher electronegativity and a weaker inter-halogen bond strength (Cl [...] . Cl) exhibits an excellent thermal response, whereas the response is weaker in the iodo derivative with stronger I [...] . I halogen bonding. 3, 5 -Dichlorosalinazid (Compound-A) exists in three polymorphic forms, two room-temperature polymorphs (Forms I and II) and one high-temperature modification (Form III). The transformation of Form I to Form III upon heating at 328 – 333  K is a reversible thermosalient transition, whereas the transformation of Form II to Form III is irreversible and non-thermosalient. 3, 5 -Dibromo- (Compound-B) and 3 -bromo- 5 -chloro- (Compound-C) <b>salinazid</b> are both dimorphic: the Form I to Form II transition in Compound-B is irreversible, whereas Compound-C shows a reversible thermosalient effect (362 – 365  K). In the case of 3, 5 -diiodosalinazid (Compound-D) and 3, 5 -difluorosalinazid (Compound-E), no phase transitions or thermal effects were observed. The thermosalient behaviour of these halosalinazid molecular crystals is understood from the anisotropy in the cell parameters (an increase in the a axis and a decrease in the b and c axes upon heating) and the sudden release of accumulated strain during the phase transition. The di-halogen <b>salinazid</b> derivatives (chlorine to iodine) show a decrease in thermal effects with an increase in halogen-bond strength. Interestingly, Compound-B shows solid-state photochromism in its polymorphs along with the thermosalient effect, wherein Form I is cyan and Form II is light orange...|$|E
