5|$|Voltaire {{depicts the}} worst of the world and his pathetic hero's desperate effort to fit it into an optimistic outlook. Almost all of Candide is a {{discussion}} of various forms of evil: its characters rarely find even temporary respite. There is at least one notable exception: the episode of El Dorado, a fantastic village in which the inhabitants are simply rational, and their society is just and reasonable. The positivity of El Dorado may be contrasted with the pessimistic attitude of most of the book. Even in this case, the bliss of El Dorado is fleeting: Candide soon leaves the village to seek Cunégonde, whom he eventually marries only out of a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligation.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Holy Roman Empire was {{not able}} to {{maintain}} political unity. In addition to the growing independence of the towns, local rulers turned their counties and duchies into private kingdoms and felt little <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligation</b> to the emperor who reigned over large parts of the nation in name only. Large parts of what now comprise the Netherlands were governed by the Count of Holland, the Duke of Gelre, the Duke of Brabant and the Bishop of Utrecht. Friesland and Groningen in the north maintained their independence and were governed by the lower nobility.|$|E
25|$|Curtiss began thorough, active {{testing of}} Genie's {{language}} in October 1971, {{when she and}} Fromkin decided that her linguistic abilities were sufficient to yield usable results. Linguists designed their tests to measure both Genie's vocabulary and her acquisition of various aspects of grammar, including syntax, phonology, and morphology. They also continued to observe her in everyday conversations to gauge what pragmatics of language she acquired. The research team considered her language acquisition to be {{a substantial part of}} their larger goal of helping her to integrate herself into society, so although they wanted to observe what vocabulary and grammar Genie could learn on her own, out of a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligation</b> they sometimes stepped in to assist her.|$|E

Hardship forges strong family bonds and highlights Kristin's <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> to her family and her faith. However, she and Erlend become estranged from Simon and Ramborg after Erlend and Ramborg become aware that Simon has never ceased to love Kristin.|$|R
25|$|The royal couple's murder {{upset and}} shocked most of Europe, but was met enthusiastically at home. Russia {{immediately}} recognized the National Assembly's decision declaring Peter the next King of Serbia and expressed satisfaction that the inter-dynastic intrigues which had plagued {{the country since}} the early 19th century {{had been brought to}} an end. Austria-Hungary declared its neutrality on the matter, but privately, policymakers in Vienna expressed hope that Peter's accession would have a placating effect. The United Kingdom demanded that the chief conspirators be severely punished, and when the Royal Serbian Government neglected to carry out this request, the British severed all diplomatic ties. Several other European nations followed in the United Kingdom's footsteps and severed ties as well. Peter lacked the power or authority to punish the conspirators. He also felt a deep <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligation</b> towards them, acknowledging that he {{would not have been able}} to assume the throne were it not for their actions.|$|E
500|$|The secular {{approach}} to conscience includes psychological, physiological, sociological, humanitarian and authoritarian views. Lawrence Kohlberg considered critical conscience {{to be an}} important psychological stage in the proper moral development of humans, associated with the capacity to rationally weigh principles of responsibility, being best encouraged in the very young by linkage with humorous personifications (such as Jiminy Cricket) and later in adolescents by debates about individually pertinent moral dilemmas. Erik Erikson placed the development of conscience in the 'pre-schooler' phase of his eight stages of normal human personality development. The psychologist Martha Stout terms conscience [...] "an intervening <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligation</b> based in our emotional attachments." [...] Thus a good conscience is associated with feelings of integrity, psychological wholeness and peacefulness and is often described using adjectives such as [...] "quiet", [...] "clear" [...] and [...] "easy".|$|E
500|$|The {{traditions and}} rituals of Freemasonry contributed {{more to the}} basic {{structure}} of the OA ritual than any other organization. In fact, {{there appears to be no}} known fraternal organization more faithful in form to Freemasonry than the OA. Familiar terms such as [...] "lodge" [...] and [...] "obligation" [...] were borrowed from Masonic practice, as were most of the ceremonial structures and ritual formulae. Even the early national meeting was called a [...] "Grand Lodge," [...] a Masonic reference. Of course, despite several facts—the common intent to impart a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligation</b> to a higher moral authority; that groups such as OA that employ these rituals share many of the moral precepts; and even that there are historical connections to the founders of OA and other organizations to Freemasonry—nothing should imply any political connection to Freemasonry itself.|$|E

2500|$|The {{state of}} New York began, in 1799, to legislate the {{abolition}} of slavery, although the process of emancipating those people enslaved in New York was not complete until July 4, 1827. Dumont had promised to grant Truth her freedom {{a year before the}} state emancipation, [...] "if she would do well and be faithful." [...] However, he changed his mind, claiming a hand injury had made her less productive. She was infuriated but continued working, spinning 100 pounds of wool, to satisfy her <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligation</b> to him.|$|E
2500|$|The Holy Roman Empire (the {{successor}} state of East Francia and then Lotharingia) ruled {{much of the}} Low Countries in the 10th and 11th century, but {{was not able to}} maintain political unity. Powerful local nobles turned their cities, counties and duchies into private kingdoms, that felt little <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligation</b> to the emperor. Holland, Hainaut, Flanders, Gelre, Brabant, and Utrecht were in a state of almost continual war or paradoxically formed personal unions. The language and culture of {{most of the people who}} lived in the County of Holland were originally Frisian. As Frankish settlement progressed from Flanders and Brabant, the area quickly became Old Low Franconian (or Old Dutch). The rest of Frisia in the north (now Friesland and Groningen) continued to maintain its independence and had its own institutions (collectively called the [...] "Frisian freedom") and resented the imposition of the feudal system.|$|E

He was announced as its new CEO in January 1991 but drew only a symbolic salary of one dollar (he remained managing general partner of Bain Capital during this time). His turnaround of Bain & Company {{has been identified as}} a primary example of Romney's turnaround talents from the business world, and Romney says there was no upside for him personally: [...] "There was no particular reason to do it other than a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligation</b> and duty to an organization that had done great things for me and which employed a thousand people." [...] However, once Romney took up the challenge, his stake in success became enormous, and his reputation would have been diminished if Bain & Company went bankrupt.

2500|$|Orwell {{set out for}} Spain {{on about}} 23 December 1936, dining with Henry Miller in Paris on the way. The American writer told Orwell that going {{to fight in the}} Civil War out of some <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligation</b> or guilt was 'sheer stupidity,' and that the Englishman's ideas 'about combating Fascism, {{defending}} democracy, etc., etc., were all baloney.' A few days later, in Barcelona, Orwell met John McNair of the Independent Labour Party (ILP) Office who quoted him: [...] "I've come to fight against Fascism". Orwell stepped into a complex political situation in Catalonia. The Republican government was supported by a number of factions with conflicting aims, including the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM– Partido Obrero de Unificación Marxista), the anarcho-syndicalist Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) and the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia (a wing of the Spanish Communist Party, which was backed by Soviet arms and aid). The ILP was linked to the POUM so Orwell joined the POUM.|$|E
2500|$|While {{she was the}} Director of the Liaison Office (1983–85), {{there were}} {{conflicts}} with the staff of Reagan's Chief of Staff James A. Baker III and his deputy Michael Deaver, which led to Senator Arlen Specter and others urging her to take a federal judgeship on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. After careful consideration, she declined the nomination. A judicial appointment would have effectively removed her from the public policy and political arena, which she did not wish. [...] She had taken the job of Public Liaison because of [...] "a profound <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligation</b> to the grassroots voters who had elected Reagan believing {{him to be a}} man of deep principle and traditional faith." [...] Infighting in the White House continued, however. [...] She eventually decided to return to Switzerland after Donald Regan became Chief of Staff, replacing James A. Baker. Whittlesey resumed her duties representing the U.S. in Bern for a second term in 1985. She was the first to greet President Reagan as he stepped off the plane in Geneva for his meeting with Gorbachev in November, 1985.|$|E

40|$|Based on 43 {{interviews}} conducted with employees who spend around {{half of their}} working-hours on non-work related activities such as cyberloafing', a typology of empty labour is suggested according to <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> work <b>obligation</b> and potential output in order to set the phenomenon of workplace time-appropriation into a theoretical context in which wasteful aspects of organization and management are taken into account. Soldiering, which emanates from a weak <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> work <b>obligation</b> in the individual, may entail aspects of resistance, {{but there are also}} less voluntary forms of empty labour deriving from a lack of relevant work tasks. All types of empty labour are, however, bound up with the simulation of productivity. Therefore, they ironically serve to maintain the capitalist firm's reputation for efficiency...|$|R

The reading, detached from the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> seems to make the reading as an entertainment and playing activity, that is, free of that compulsory feature which usually is present in the school. In this kind of activity, the reading becomes more pleasant. Understood in this way, this practice may be a very efficient way to develop the interest of the children in reading activities...|$|R
