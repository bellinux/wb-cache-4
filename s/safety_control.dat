25|$|At the 2009 TPA annual meeting, {{concerns}} were raised about landings {{at the airport}} after the 11 pm closing time. Local residents had two concerns: the late-night noise and <b>safety.</b> <b>Control</b> tower staff are not present at Bishop after 11 pm (a practice that is very common at most Canadian airports). In one specific incident in September 2008, a late Porter flight was advised by air traffic controllers to divert to Pearson, but instead landed at Bishop. For the landing, Porter was fined an undisclosed amount by the TPA.

40|$|The {{likelihood}} of the voluntary adoption of hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) among food processing firms is evaluated by exploring {{the perceptions of}} food safety managers {{with respect to a}} range of possible motivating factors including the exogenous pressure to adopt HACCP, efficacy of existing food <b>safety</b> <b>controls,</b> perception that HACCP will improve the firm's food <b>safety</b> <b>controls,</b> relative costs and benefits of HACCP implementation, impact of HACCP on business performance, and the nature of barriers to implementing HACCP. While market-based factors exert substantial pressure on firms to adopt HACCP, many food safety managers perceive that their existing food <b>safety</b> <b>controls</b> are adequate to meet existing food safety demands. While good manufacturing practice (GMP) and traceability are considered the most efficacious food <b>safety</b> <b>controls,</b> HACCP is most often perceived to provide intangible and "incidental" benefits that are often not recognized by food safety managers a priori. An important barrier to the voluntary adoption of HACCP is the perceived questionable appropriateness of HACCP for enhancing food <b>safety</b> <b>controls,</b> while financial constraints can be an absolute barrier to implementation. The results suggest a number of potential strategies through which the implementation of HACCP might be facilitated and enhanced through cooperation and coordination between regulators and industry organizations.

2500|$|Another {{frequently}} ignored {{safety regulation}} {{mentioned in the}} report was the [...] "deadman's pedal", which a locomotive engineer had to keep depressed for the train to remain underway. [...] Were he to fall asleep or pass out, his foot would slip from the pedal, triggering an alarm and engaging the train's brakes automatically a few seconds later. [...] However, many engineers found this tiresome and bypassed the pedal by placing a heavy weight (often a worn out brake shoe) on it. [...] It was uncertain whether the pedal had been bypassed {{in this case because}} the lead locomotive of the train had been destroyed. [...] A more advanced safety device was available, the reset <b>safety</b> <b>control</b> (RSC), which required crew members to take an action such as pushing a button at regular intervals, or else automatic braking would occur, but neither lead locomotive was equipped with this safety feature. [...] While the second locomotive in the freight train was equipped with RSC, it was not assigned as the lead locomotive because it lacked a [...] "comfort cab". [...] Management and union practice was to place more comfortable locomotives at the front of trains, even at the expense of safety.|$|E

This paper investigates {{the potential for a}} deflagration hazard within these boxes and whether <b>safety</b> <b>controls</b> identified for drum deflagration hazards should be applied to operations involving these boxes. The study evaluates the accumulation of hydrogen and VOCs within the waste box and the transport of these gases and vapors out of the waste box. To perform the analysis, there were numerous and major assumptions made regarding the generation rate and the transport pathway dimensions and their number. Since there is little actual data with regards to these assumptions, analyses of three potential configurations were performed to obtain some indication of the bounds of the issue (the concentration of hydrogen or flammable VOCs within a waste box). A brief description of each of the three cases along with the results of the analysis is summarized...|$|R

While the stringency of public regulation has been enhanced and increased emphasis put on management-based food safety standards, pri-vate regulation is playing a greater role in driving the adoption decisions of firms. Further, systems of private food safety standards are extending across a wide geographical sphere through the evolution of global commodity chains. Recognising the dual role of public and private regulation suggests that new perspectives are needed on the nature and role of regula-tion in the management of food safety...|$|R
