5|$|The {{secondary}} armament of dreadnoughts was, on the whole, unsatisfactory. A {{hit from}} a light gun {{could not be}} relied on to stop a destroyer. Heavier guns could not be relied on to hit a destroyer, as experience at the Battle of Jutland showed. The casemate mountings of heavier guns proved problematic; being low in the hull, they proved liable to flooding, and on several classes, some were removed and plated over. The only <b>sure</b> <b>way</b> to protect a dreadnought from destroyer or torpedo boat attack {{was to provide a}} destroyer squadron as an escort. After World War I the secondary armament tended to be mounted in turrets on the upper deck and around the superstructure. This allowed a wide field of fire and good protection without the negative points of casemates. Increasingly through the 1920s and 1930s, the secondary guns were seen as {{a major part of the}} anti-aircraft battery, with high-angle, dual-purpose guns increasingly adopted.|$|E

His wife quest, however, is difficult because in that time (in the 19th century) based on traditions women were kept at home and when allowed out they were heavily covered in hijab and because actually you {{were not allowed to}} know who {{you were going to get}} married with in the 19th century.

25|$|M.N. Roy, an ex-member of the Anushilan Samiti, {{perhaps the}} most {{important}} secret revolutionary organisation operating in East Bengal in the opening years of the 20th century, went to Moscow in by the end of April 1920. The new Russian government under Lenin evinced interest in him and encouraged him to form an Indian Communist Party. Roy went on to found the émigré Communist Party of India on 17 October 1920 in Tashkent. On his return to India, M.N. Roy who had read Gandhi Vs. Lenin met Dange in 1922. Dange at that time was closely associating with Lotvala to spread Marxian ideas. It was during this period that Dange grew in prominence as a Marxist; a <b>sure</b> <b>way</b> those days to invite antagonism from the British Government.|$|E
25|$|Pharaohs' {{subjects}} {{viewed the}} pharaoh {{as a living}} god, the god Horus. Once the pharaoh died, he became the god Osiris, the king of eternity. While some retainers' deaths {{appear to have been}} taken for granted, other sacrifices appear to have raised the status and wealth of some retainers in the afterlife. This can be inferred from the wealth they were interred with and their graves' position in relation to the king's grave. This also suggests that the retainers agreed to be sacrificed to raise their social status and wealth in the afterlife. Matthew Adams, an archeologist from the University of Pennsylvania and the associate director of an expedition made by New York University, Yale and the University of Pennsylvania, suggests that the ancient Egyptians may have viewed being sacrificed at a king's death a <b>sure</b> <b>way</b> to reach eternal life. For a civilization so centered on the life to come, a guarantee of eternal happiness and security would seem a likely motivation for a retainer to agree to be sacrificed.|$|E

Enobarbus once again knows of Antony's unrelenting attachment to Cleopatra and Cleopatra's mind games while the audience knows Cleopatra isn't dead as Antony kills himself over her. They both spent their whole lives trying to achieve higher fame than the other and became notorious for their lust. They are their own Gods and live separate from those that they call normal and watch. The play progresses into the protagonists decline in fame, leaving them to pursue a <b>sure</b> <b>way</b> into that immortality they coveted. They become immortals in death along with even more fame and has as well achieved their goal from the beginning. They die in the name of their love when they really die in the name of fame. A status of nobility higher than us and pity for the tragedy that is their relationship. The tragedy is Antony and Cleopatra's own happy ending as death was a small price to pay to become real gods. They proved that the only death that could touch them were by their own hand, further increasing that godly power they received from the people. Now they are apart from those they watched, now they are above them, and now they will be worshipped as gods.|$|E
500|$|The idea to use zombies for [...] "Millennium" [...] {{arose from}} a {{separate}} aborted project. Reportedly, Stephen King, who had co-penned season five's [...] "Chinga", wished {{to write an}} episode based on George A. Romero's cult 1968 zombie film Night of the Living Dead. In addition, Romero was slated to direct the episode. According to [...] "Millennium" [...] co-writer and executive producer Frank Spotnitz, the staff of The X-Files met with both King and Romero and the two showed an interest in producing the episode. Initially, the episode was slated for the seventh season, but it never came to fruition. Zombies as a plot device were then later relegated to what would become [...] "Millennium".

[...] He had threatened to kill the new king with his own hands, but was asked by Catesby to restrain himself, and told [...] "I am thinking of a most <b>sure</b> <b>way</b> and I will soon let thee know what it is." [...] Thus Percy found himself at the Duck and Drake inn near the Strand in London, along with Catesby and his cousin Thomas Wintour, John Wright and Guy Fawkes.

500|$|According to the {{principle}} of a numerical majority, the will of the more numerous citizens should always rule, regardless of the burdens on the minority. [...] Such a principle tends toward a consolidation of power in which the interests of the absolute majority always prevail over those of the minority. Calhoun believed that the great achievement of the American constitution was in checking the tyranny of a numerical majority through institutional procedures that required a concurrent majority, such that each important interest in the community must consent to the actions of government. To secure a concurrent majority, those interests that have a numerical majority must compromise with the interests that are in the minority. A concurrent majority requires a unanimous consent of all the major interests in a community, which is the only <b>sure</b> <b>way</b> of preventing tyranny of the majority. This idea supported Calhoun's doctrine of interposition or nullification, in which the state governments could refuse to enforce or comply with a policy of the Federal government that threatened the vital interests of the states.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the ease}} with which Catesby seems to have {{inspired}} his fellow conspirators, that it was he and not Fawkes (today most often associated with 5November) who devised {{what became known as the}} Gunpowder Plot, has largely been forgotten. The precise date on which he set events in motion is unknown, but it is likely that he first had the idea early in 1604. Sometime around June of the previous year he was visited by his friend Thomas Percy. A great-grandson of the 4th Earl of Northumberland, Percy was reported to have had a [...] "wild youth" [...] before he became a Catholic, and during Elizabeth's final years had been entrusted by the 9th Earl with a secret mission to James's court in Scotland, to plead with the king on behalf of England's Catholics. He now complained bitterly about what he considered to be James's treachery, and threatened to kill him. Catesby replied [...] "No, no, Tom, thou shalt not venture to small purpose, but if thou wilt be a traitor thou shalt be to some great advantage." [...] Percy listened while Catesby added [...] "I am thinking of a most <b>sure</b> <b>way</b> and I will soon let thee know what it is." [...] During Allhallowtide on 31October he sent for his cousin Thomas Wintour, who was at Huddington Court in Worcestershire with his brother Robert. Thomas was educated as a lawyer and had fought for England in the Low Countries, but in 1600 had converted to Catholicism. Following the Earl of Essex's failed rebellion, he had travelled to Spain to raise support for English Catholics, a mission which the authorities would later describe as comprising part of a 'Spanish Treason'. Although Thomas declined his invitation, Catesby again invited him in February the next year.|$|E

2500|$|Honorific {{speech is}} used in several {{settings}} {{as a way of}} showing honor and respect to older ones, those who have been assigned titles, royalty, and in almost all religious settings. Depending on the second or third person, a given sentence may vary widely because honorific speech comprises a separate vocabulary, including all parts of speech and topics both lofty and mundane.
