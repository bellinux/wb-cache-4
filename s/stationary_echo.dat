40|$|Determination {{of blood}} {{velocities}} for color flow mapping systems involves both <b>stationary</b> <b>echo</b> canceling and velocity estimation. Often the <b>stationary</b> <b>echo</b> canceling filter is the limiting factor in color flow mapping and the optimization and {{further development of}} this filter {{is crucial to the}} improvement of color flow imaging. Optimization based on in-vivo data is difficult since the blood and tissue signals cannot be accurately distinguished and the correct extend of the vessel under investigation is often unknown. This study introduces a model for the simulation of blood velocity data in which tissue motion is included. Tissue motion from breathing, heart beat, and vessel pulsation were determined based on in-vivo RF-data obtained from 10 healthy volunteers. The measurements were taken at the carotid artery at one condition and in the liver at three conditions. Each measurement was repeated 10 times to cover the whole cardiac cycle and a total of 400 independent RF measurements of [...] ...|$|E

Strong avoidance reactions were observed on haddock, with both horizontal and vertical movements of the fish. The observations indicate that the fish density available for the bottom trawl at shallow depths may be significantly higher than estimated by the echo integration system on board the trawling vessel, and that vessel avoidance may be an important trawl selection factor...|$|E

Several strong, downward avoidance {{reactions of}} haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) were recorded. At depths greater than 100 m, however, the reaction pattern was weak and irregular. A comparative analysis of echo-integrator data at random bottom-trawl sampling sites indicates that fish avoidance occurs between the surface and 200 -m depth, even before the vessel arrives. At greater depths, such pre-vessel avoidance reactions are not significant...|$|E
25|$|Clutter is {{detected}} and neutralized in several ways. Clutter tends to appear static between radar scans; on subsequent scan echoes, desirable targets will appear to move, and all <b>stationary</b> <b>echoes</b> can be eliminated. Sea clutter {{can be reduced}} by using horizontal polarization, while rain is reduced with circular polarization (note that meteorological radars wish for the opposite effect, and therefore use linear polarization to detect precipitation). Other methods attempt to increase the signal-to-clutter ratio.|$|R

50|$|Unlike {{spectral}} Doppler, Colour tissue Doppler samples velocities {{from all}} {{points of the}} sector, by shooting two pulses successively, and calculating the velocity from the phase shift between them by autocorrelation. The calculation is slightly different from the true Doppler effect, but the result becomes identical. This results in a single velocity value per sample volume. The result is a velocity field of (nearly) simultaneous velocity vectors towards the probe. The advantage of colour Doppler over spectral Doppler is that all velocities can be sampled simultaneously. The disadvantage is {{that if there is}} clutter noise (stationary reverberations), the <b>stationary</b> <b>echoes</b> will be integrated in the velocity calculation, resulting in an under estimate. As pulsed wave Doppler are displayed as a spectrum, the colour Doppler values will correspond to the mean of the spectrum (in the absence of clutter), giving slightly lower values. In the HUNT study, the difference in peak systolic values were about 1.5 cm/s.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 41 - 42) In airborne or shipborne doppler radar, discrimination {{of moving}} target <b>echos</b> from <b>stationary</b> clutter <b>echo</b> {{is complicated by}} the doppler frequency shift of the <b>stationary</b> clutter <b>echo</b> due to the radar's own motion. When a severe clutter interference is expected, a specially designed doppler filter is needed to reject as much of the clutter as possible while enhancing the echo signal from a moving target. For this purpose, the optimum Moving Target Indication filter is described and a FORTRAN program to calculate the filter weights is presented. The frequency response of certain calculated filters is also analyzed. To implement these filters in a radar system, the optimum weights must be truncated to fit the finite word length of the radar's computer. The effect of truncation is analyzed for various degrees of truncation and various filter bandwidths. The filter's truncation errors are found to be within a tolerable limit for a typical level of truncation (sic.). If more than one set of filter weights can be stored in the radar's computer, the computer may be able to choose a set of weights based on information about the radar's own motion. A simple method of implementing the adaptive doppler filter by the method of variable filter weights is suggested...|$|R
40|$|Mesopelagic {{acoustic}} scattering layers (SLs) in 2 fjords {{were studied}} from a stationary research vessel. Diel vertical movements of SLs were assessed by hull-mounted transducers, while in situ behavior of individuals constituting the SLs was resolved by a submerged echo sounder. The {{study focused on}} SLs {{made up of the}} lightfish Maurolicus muelleri and the lanternfish Benthosema glaciale. Individual fish migrated in a pronounced stepwise manner, alternating between vertical movements and stationary phases both during ascent and descent. Mean lengths of steps varied between 2. 01 and 0. 40 m, and mean duration of stationary phases between 69 and 36 s for fish in different SLs. Such travel-pause behavior concords with saltatory search, where fish scan the water for prey during the stationary phases, relocate and scan a new water parcel. Little activity was recorded among individuals in deep water, apart from infrequent, short shifts in vertical distribution. This study shows that <b>stationary</b> submerged <b>echo</b> sounders can provide detailed information on in situ behavior of mesopelagic fish...|$|R

Our observations in June 1996 detected three cases of the line-shaped <b>stationary</b> radar <b>echoes</b> extending from the Nagasaki Peninsula area to the direction of Isahaya Bay. The appearance {{of this kind of}} line echo is fairly common. These particular echoes suggest that there is a topographical effect of rain-cloud formation, because these line-shaped echoes appear only under some common limited conditions, which are : (a) A considerably strong, humid surface wind from the S to SSW. (b) Individual cellular echoes within the linear echoes move in a velocity coinciding with the upper wind, so that, every component is replaced continuously.

40|$|The {{application}} of <b>stationary</b> <b>echo</b> canceling to ultrasonic estimation of blood velocities using time-domain cross-correlation is investigated. Expressions are derived {{that shows the}} influence from the echo canceler on the signals that enter the crosscorrelation estimator. It is demonstrated that the filtration results in a velocity dependent degradation of the signal-to-noise ratio. An analytic expression is given for the degradation for a realistic pulse. Due to the inherent non-linear method of velocity estimation, it is most appropriate to state a probability of correct detection at low signal-to-noise ratios. This probability is influenced by signal-to-noise ratio, transducer bandwidth, center frequency, number of samples in the range gate, and number of A-lines employed in the estimation. Quantitative results calculated by a simple simulation program are given for the variation in probability from these parameters.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of real-time blood velocity estimators using time-domain cross-correlation is investigated. The basic algorithm is presented for doing <b>stationary</b> <b>echo</b> canceling, cross-correlation estimation and subsequent velocity estimation. Sampled data acquired at rates of approximately 20 MHz {{are used in}} the algorithm imposing a heavy burden on the signal processing hardware. The algorithm is analyzed with regard to the high sampling frequency, and a method for performing real time high speed data movement and cross-correlation is suggested. Implementation schemes based on using the sign of the data as well as the full precision are proposed. From an analysis of the process it is concluded that the sign data implementation can attain real-time processing. This can also be obtained for the full precision data, however, at the expense of using a number of dedicated signal processing chips. Both implementations suggested can handle the estimation of velocities for A-lines acquired [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Institute of Perception, Action and BehaviourSo-called CF-FM bats {{are highly}} mobile creatures who emit long calls in which {{much of the}} energy is {{concentrated}} in a single frequency. These bats face sensor interpretation problems {{very similar to those}} of mobile robots provided with ultrasonic sensors, while navigating in cluttered environments. This dissertation presents biologically inspired engineering on the use of narrowband Sonar in mobile robotics. It replicates, using robotics as a modelling medium, how CF-FM bats process and use the constant frequency part of their emitted call for several tasks, aiming to improve the design and use of narrowband ultrasonic sensors for mobile robot navigation. The experimental platform for the work is RoBat, the biomimetic sonarhead designed by Peremans and Hallam, mounted on a commercial mobile platform as part of the work reported in this dissertation. System integration, including signal processing capabilities inspired by the bat’s auditory system and closed loop control of both sonarhead and mobile base movements, was designed and implemented. The result is a versatile tool for studying the relationship between environmental features, their acoustic correlates and the cues computable from them, in the context of both static, and dynamic real-time closed loop, behaviour. Two models of the signal processing performed by the bat’s cochlea were implemented, based on sets of bandpass filters followed by full-wave rectification and low-pass filtering. One filterbank uses Butterworth filters whose centre frequencies vary linearly across the set. The alternative filterbank uses gammatone filters, with centre frequencies varying non-linearly across the set. Two methods of estimating Doppler-shift from the return echoes after cochlear signal processing were implemented. The first was a simple energy-weighted average of filter centre frequencies. The second was a novel neural network-based technique. Each method was tested with each of the cochlear models, and evaluated in the context of several dynamic tasks in which RoBat was moved at different velocities towards <b>stationary</b> <b>echo</b> sources such as walls and posts. Overall, the performance of the linear filterbank was more consistent than the gammatone. The same applies to the ANN, with consistently better noise performance than the weighted average. The effect of multiple reflectors contained in a single echo was also analysed in terms of error in Doppler-shift estimation assuming a single wider reflector. Inspired by the Doppler-shift compensation and obstacle avoidance behaviours found in CF-FM bats, a Doppler-based controller suitable for collision detection and convoy navigation in robots was devised and implemented in RoBat. The performance of the controller is satisfactory despite low Doppler-shift resolution caused by lower velocity of the robot when compared to real bats. Barshan’s and Kuc’s 2 D object localisation method was implemented and adapted to the geometry of RoBat’s sonarhead. Different TOF estimation methods were tested, the parabola fitting being the most accurate. Arc scanning, the ear movement technique to recover elevation cues proposed by Walker, and tested in simulation by her, Peremans and Hallam, was here implemented on RoBat, and integrated with Barshan’s and Kuc’s method in a preliminary narrowband 3 D tracker. Finally, joint work with Kim, K¨ampchen and Hallam on designing optimal reflector surfaces inspired by the CF-FM bat’s large pinnae is presented. Genetic algorithms are used for improving the current echolocating capabilities of the sonarhead for both arc scanning and IID behaviours. Multiple reflectors around the transducer using a simple ray light-like model of sound propagation are evolved. Results show phase cancellation problems and the need of a more complete model of wave propagation. Inspired by a physical model of sound diffraction and reflections in the human concha a new model is devised and used to evolve pinnae surfaces made of finite elements. Some interesting paraboloid shapes are obtained, improving performance significantly with respect to the bare transducer...|$|E
40|$|Hands-free {{telecommunication}} systems require {{acoustic echo}} con-trol to cancel echoes {{that arise from}} a coupling between loudspeak-ers and microphones. Acoustic echo suppression (AES) represents a robust and efficient approach to cope with such echoes. Since AES applies a frequency selective attenuation of the microphone signal, it may also affect the near-end speech quality in case of non-ideal behavior of the AES. In this contribution we present a method to as-sure reliable suppression of echoes, while minimizing distortions of the near-end speech. The proposed approach is based on perform-ing the suppression separately for <b>stationary</b> and non-stationary <b>echo</b> components. This allows for different optimization strategies for de-termining the corresponding echo suppression rules...|$|R
40|$|We study {{synthetic}} aperture radar (SAR) imaging and motion estimation of complex scenes consisting of stationary and moving targets. We use the classic SAR setup with a single antenna emitting signals and receiving the echoes from the scene. The known motion estimation methods for SAR work only in simple cases, with {{one or a few}} targets in the same motion. We propose to extend the applicability of these methods to complex scenes, by complementing them with a data pre-processing step intended to separate the <b>echoes</b> from the <b>stationary</b> targets and the moving ones. We present two approaches. The first is an iteration designed to subtract the <b>echoes</b> from the <b>stationary</b> targets one by one. This approach first estimates the location of each stationary target from a preliminary image, and then uses the location to define a filter that removes the corresponding target’s echo from the data. The second approach is based on the robust principle component analysis (PCA) method. The key observation is that with appropriate pre-processing and windowing, the discrete samples of the <b>stationary</b> target <b>echoes</b> form a low rank matrix, whereas the samples of a few moving target echoes form a high rank sparse matrix. The robust PCA method is designed to separate the low rank from the sparse part, and thus can be used for the SAR data separation. We present a brief analysis of the two methods and explain how they can be combined to improve the data separation for extended and complex imaging scenes. We also assess the performance of the methods with extensive numerical simulations. ...|$|R
