5|$|Montacute, {{like many}} Elizabethan mansions, is built in an 'E' <b>shape,</b> <b>a</b> much-used plan in this era. On {{the ground floor}} was the great hall, kitchens and pantries, on the upper floors, {{retiring}} rooms for the family and honoured guests. Over the centuries, the layout and use of rooms changed: drawing and dining rooms evolved on the ground floor.|$|E
5|$|Between 1142 and 1170 the Knights Hospitaller {{undertook}} a building programme on the site. The castle was defended by a stone curtain wall studded with square towers which projected slightly. The main entrance was between two towers {{on the eastern}} side, {{and there was a}} postern gate in the northwest tower. At the center was a courtyard surrounded by vaulted chambers. The lay of the land dictated the castle's irregular <b>shape.</b> <b>A</b> site with natural defences was a typical location for Crusader castles and steep slopes provided Krak des Chevaliers with defences on all sides bar one, where the castle's defences were concentrated. This phase of building was incorporated into the later castle's construction.|$|E
5|$|Both of the mansion's {{two floors}} consist of four large rooms with high ceilings, {{and each of}} these rooms {{is exactly the same}} size and <b>shape.</b> <b>A</b> grand {{stairway}} is located {{at the end of the}} mansion's central hall, extending from the first floor to the attic. The stairway's handrail is crafted of walnut, and it is connected to the stairway's shallow steps by a balustrade consisting of three small balusters per step.|$|E

5|$|Broaching is a {{machining}} process {{that uses a}} toothed tool, called a broach, to remove material. There are two main types of broaching: linear and rotary. In linear broaching, which is the more common process, the broach is run linearly against a surface of the workpiece to effect the cut. Linear broaches are used in a broaching machine, which is also sometimes shortened to broach. In rotary broaching, the broach is rotated and pressed into the workpiece to cut an axisymmetric <b>shape.</b> <b>A</b> rotary broach is used in a lathe or screw machine. In both processes the cut is performed in one pass of the broach, which makes it very efficient.|$|E
5|$|Professor Johannes Krahn, {{who built}} several churches and early skyscrapers {{such as the}} Beehive House in Frankfurt am Main, {{designed}} a space recalling elements of an early Romanesque Basilica. In a simple <b>shape,</b> <b>a</b> single long nave is concluded by a semicircle choir around the altar. On the right side the wall opens to a side chapel, reminiscent of a transept. The outer walls are sandstone, visible both inside and outside. Light flows in from a band of windows under the plain wooden ceiling. The combination of materials {{has been compared to}} Le Corbusier. The building recalls the austere style of sacred architecture of the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|The pair's latest book, The Body Shape Bible, was {{published}} on 18 September 2007. Through a survey about different body shapes conducted amongst women, Constantine and Woodall {{were able to}} discover the twelve most common women's body shapes. They used this information to write The Body Shape Bible which highlights these twelve shapes which have all been named in ways such as 'cornet' or 'brick'. In the fashion advice book, women can interpret which shape they are, and can then be given adequate fashion advice on their own individual <b>shape.</b> <b>A</b> few pages in the book are also devoted to illustrating some of Constantine and Woodall's own fashion disasters.|$|E

5|$|By gaining {{power through}} {{a vote of}} {{confidence}} from the people and then willingly surrendering power, Selvo, like many other Doges who underwent similar transitions, left a long-term impact on the succession process that would eventually become a model for peaceful, anti-nepotistic transitions of power in a classical republic. Although his deposition did not immediately change the system, it was one of many important changes of power in a society that {{was in the process of}} moving away from a monarchy and toward a government led by an elected official. Following the battles at Corfu, Selvo was seen by many as inept and incapable of handling the duties that a Doge must perform. His apparent squandering of nearly the entire fleet coupled with a decade-long distrust for his royal wife caused Selvo to become unpopular in Venice. By responding to the will of the people, Selvo helped <b>shape</b> <b>a</b> society that would eventually create a complicated system to check the power of its most influential members, create cooperative governmental branches that checked each other's power, and fuse the nation into a classical republic.|$|E
5|$|The neck {{formed a}} straighter S <b>shape</b> (<b>a</b> sigmoid curve typical of theropods) than that seen in other theropods; in fact, the neck was {{initially}} thought to lack the Scurve. The {{shape of the}} cervical vertebrae indicate that they tapered towards the head and were progressively longer front to back. The neural spines of the cervical vertebrae were low, thin, and were not always sutured to the centra (the bodies of the vertebrae). The axis vertebra, small relative {{to the size of}} the skull, had a well-developed hyposphene. The centra of the dorsal vertebrae were similar in size. Like other dinosaurs, Baryonyx reduced its weight (skeletal pneumaticity) with fenestrae (openings) in the neural arches and with pleurocoels (hollow depressions) in the centra (primarily near the transverse processes). From front to back, the neural spines of the dorsal vertebrae changed from short and stout to tall and broad.|$|E
