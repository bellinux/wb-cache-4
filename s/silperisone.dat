40|$|The spinal reflex {{depressant}} {{mechanism of}} tolperisone {{and some of}} its structural analogs with central muscle relaxant action was investigated. Tolperisone (50 – 400 M), eperisone, lanperisone, inaperisone, and <b>silperisone</b> (25 – 200 M) dose dependently depressed the ventral root potential of isolated hemisected spinal cord of 6 -day-old rats. The local anesthetic lidocaine (100 – 800 M) produced qualitatively similar depres-sion of spinal functions in the hemicord preparation, whereas its blocking effect on afferent nerve conduction was clearly stronger. In vivo, tolperisone and <b>silperisone</b> as well as lido-caine (10 mg/kg intravenously) depressed ventral root reflexes and excitability of motoneurons. However, in contrast with li-docaine, the muscle relaxant drugs seemed to have a more pronounced action on the synaptic responses than on th...|$|E
40|$|The major drug {{binding site}} of sodium {{channels}} is inaccessible from the extracellular side, drug molecules can only access it {{either from the}} membrane phase, or from the intracellular aqueous phase. For this reason, ligand-membrane interactions are as important determinants of inhibitor properties, as ligand-protein interactions. One way to probe this is to modify the pH of the extracellular fluid, which alters the ratio of charged vs. uncharged forms of some compounds, thereby changing their interaction with the membrane. In this electrophysiology study we used three different pH values: 6. 0, 7. 3 and 8. 6 to test {{the significance of the}} protonation-deprotonation equilibrium in drug access and affinity. We investigated drugs of several different indications: carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenytoin, lidocaine, bupivacaine, mexiletine, flecainide, ranolazine, riluzole, memantine, ritanserin, tolperisone, <b>silperisone,</b> ambroxol, haloperidol, chlorpromazine, clozapine, fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, amitriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, maprotiline, nisoxetine, mianserin, mirtazapine, venlafaxine, nefazodone and trazodone. We recorded the pH-dependence of potency, reversibility, as well as onset/offset kinetics. As expected, we observed a strong correlation between the acidic dissociation constant (pKa) of drugs and the pH-dependence of their potency. Unexpectedly, however, the pH-dependence of reversibility or kinetics showed diverse patterns, not simple correlation. Our data are best explained by a model where drug molecules can be trapped in at least two chemically different environments: A hydrophilic trap (which may be the aqueous cavity within the inner vestibule), which favors polar and less lipophilic compounds, and a lipophilic trap (which may be the membrane phase itself, and/or lipophilic binding sites on the channel). Rescue from the hydrophilic and lipophilic traps can be promoted by alkalic and acidic extracellular pH, respectively...|$|E
