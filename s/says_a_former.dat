50|$|On 22 May 2012, a {{blog post}} from lemonde.fr {{identified}} {{the killer of}} Pierre Goldman as René Resciniti de <b>Says.</b> <b>A</b> <b>former</b> paratrooper for the French Armed Forces, Resciniti de Says was known as René lélégant and died on 17 April 2012 {{at the age of}} 61. Goldmans assassin had previously been identified under the pseudonym Gustavo by documentarian Michel Despratx in 2010. Extreme right journalist, Emmanuel Ratier, in the bimonthly newsletter Faits et Documents, claims the true identity of Gustavo to have been René Resciniti de Says. The blog post alleges that René Resciniti de Says was an associate of French monarchist group Action Française as well as being one of Bob Denards mercenaries. Gustavo, the 2010 Michel Despratx documentary which was broadcast by Canal+, claims to have assassinated Goldman as part of a four-person commando squad which included an inspector of the Direction de la surveillance du territoire (DST) and a police officer of the Direction centrale des renseignements généraux (RG). Nevertheless, as pointed out by the blog post, Gustavos testimony and his identification as René Resciniti de Says remain to be corroborated.|$|E
40|$|Back in 1998, when Suharto’s New Order regime crumbled in {{the face}} of {{economic}} turmoil and massive student protests, Golkar seemed destined for the dustbin of history. The party had been the regime’s electoral vehicle, and many of those who participated in the demonstrations viewed it as an artificially created and thoroughly corrupt organisation that had helped the regime to maintain a pseudo-democratic façade. Now that Suharto had resigned, many activists hoped Golkar would also disappear from the political stage. But despite widespread public anger and demands for its disbandment, the party has proven remarkably resilient. ‘Golkar is like a zombie,’ <b>says</b> <b>a</b> <b>former</b> high-ranking party member who left the party in 1998. ‘You think it’s dead but in fact it’s always there. ...|$|E

Initially, Alphonse had an influential supporter for his position through his long friendship with statesman Léon <b>Say,</b> <b>a</b> <b>former</b> employee of the Rothschild's Northern Railway Company who became the Minister of Finance in 1872.

The diary of John Howell, tenant farmer of Beamish and House Farm gives the year of planting as 1832.For most of the 14th century and into the 15th the manor of Albrighton, together with Ryton, was held by the Carles, Careles or Careless family.

5000|$|Reviewing Richard, Paul Owen of The Guardian {{writes that}} “It seems a cheap {{criticism}} to <b>say</b> that <b>a</b> <b>former</b> music journalist falls back too frequently on {{the style of}} the indie press, but unfortunately that is the case here...Banality and lack of imagination mar the text...Myers deploys frequent paragraph breaks and short, solemn sentences in an attempt to imbue the text with gravitas, a device overused to the point of self-parody. The book is also poorly edited, adding to an overall impression of sloppiness.” Owen {{goes on to say that}} “Myers tries to interpret Edwards's depression, eating disorders and self-harm, key components of his cult status and crucial precursors of his decision to disappear. The trouble is that the real Richey wrote about these things far more memorably and distinctively himself, most notably on his final album with the Manics, The Holy Bible...Set against this existing body of work, the task Myers has set himself seems somewhat pointless...it is hard to escape the feeling that this is less a novel than a music biography written in the first and second person.” ...|$|R
5|$|Another {{strike in}} Szczecin broke out on 22 January 1971. In a risky move, Gierek went to Szczecin on 24 January and to Gdańsk the next day.

Workers striking in Szczecin formulated demands in the area of freely elected worker councils and union representatives. Gierek agreed, but the authorities soon marginalized and eliminated the worker leaders from the legally existing structures and their places of employment. The February 1971 Łódź strikes followed and concentrated on economic demands. Afterwards prices were lowered, wage increases were announced, and sweeping economic and political changes were promised.|$|R
