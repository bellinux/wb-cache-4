40|$|Abstract Background Emerging and re-emerging {{infectious}} diseases {{are a significant}} public health concern, and early detection and immediate response is crucial for disease control. These challenges {{have led to the}} need for new approaches and technologies to reinforce the capacity of traditional <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> for detecting emerging {{infectious diseases}}. In the last few years, the availability of novel web-based data sources has contributed substantially to infectious disease surveillance. This study explores the burgeoning field of web-based infectious disease <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> by examining their current status, importance, and potential challenges. Methods A systematic review framework was applied to the search, screening, and analysis of web-based infectious disease <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems.</b> We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases to extensively review the English literature published between 2000 and 2015. Eleven <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> were chosen for evaluation according to their high frequency of application. Relevant terms, including newly coined terms, development and classification of the <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems,</b> and various characteristics associated with the systems were studied. Results Based on a detailed and informative review of the 11 web-based infectious disease <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems,</b> it was evident that these systems exhibited clear strengths, as compared to traditional <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems,</b> but with some limitations yet to be overcome. The major strengths of the newly emerging <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> are that they are intuitive, adaptable, low-cost, and operated in real-time, all of which are necessary features of an effective public health tool. The most apparent potential challenges of the web-based systems are those of inaccurate interpretation and prediction of health status, and privacy issues, based on an individual’s internet activity. Conclusion Despite being in a nascent stage with further modification needed, web-based <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> have evolved to complement traditional national <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems.</b> This review highlights ways in which the strengths of existing systems can be maintained and weaknesses alleviated to implement optimal web <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

5|$|The People's Committees {{led to a}} high {{percentage}} of public involvement in decision making, within the limits permitted by the RCC, but exacerbated tribal divisions. They also served as a <b>surveillance</b> <b>system,</b> aiding the security services in locating individuals with views critical of the RCC, leading to the arrest of Ba'athists, Marxists, and Islamists. Operating in a pyramid structure, the base form of these Committees were local working groups, who sent elected representatives to the district level, and from there to the national level, divided between the General People's Congress and the General People's Committee. Above these remained Gaddafi and the RCC, who remained responsible for all major decisions. In crossing regional and tribal identities, the committee system aided national integration and centralization and tightened Gaddafi's control over the state and administrative apparatus.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background In recent years, {{problems}} like insufficient coordination, low efficiency, and heavy working load in national communicable disease <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> in China have {{been pointed out}} by many researchers. To strengthen the national communicable disease <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> becomes an immediate concern. Since the World Health Organization has recommended that a structured approach to strengthen national communicable disease surveillance must include an evaluation to existing systems which usually begins with a systematic description, we conducted the first survey for communicable disease <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> in China, {{in order to understand}} the situation of core and support surveillance activities at province-level and county-level centers for disease control and prevention (CDCs). Methods A nationwide survey was conducted by mail between May and October 2006 to investigate the implementation of core and support activities of the Notifiable Disease Reporting System (NDRS) and disease-specific <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> in all of the 31 province-level and selected 14 county-level CDCs in Mainland China The comments on the performance of communicable disease <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> were also collected from the directors of CDCs in this survey. Results The core activities of NDRS such as confirmation, reporting and analysis and some support activities such as supervision and staff training were found sufficient in both province-level and county-level surveyed CDCs, but other support activities including information feedback, equipment and financial support need to be strengthened in most of the investigated CDCs. A total of 47 communicable diseases or syndromes were under surveillance at province level, and 20 diseases or syndromes at county level. The activities among different disease-specific <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> varied widely. Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), measles and tuberculosis (TB) <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> got relatively high recognition both at province level and county level. Conclusions China has already established a national communicable disease surveillance framework that combines NDRS and disease-specific <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems.</b> The core and support activities of NDRS were found sufficient, while the implementation of those activities varied among different disease-specific <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Most of the {{notification}} {{mechanisms of}} current intelligent video <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> {{are based on}} traditional methods, which either require operators on duty to receive and deal with early-warning notification from <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems,</b> or notice related personnel by broadcasting. The former costs {{a great deal of}} labor and effort, and the latter is inconvenient. Moreover, some other intelligent video <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> could even only provide clues for ex post analysis, whose instantaneity performance is poor. To solve these problems of notification mechanisms in current intelligent video <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems,</b> a security early warning system based on mobile push technology which uses XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is proposed in this paper. The performance test results indicate that the proposed system not only improves the instantaneity performance, but also saves labor and effort...|$|R
