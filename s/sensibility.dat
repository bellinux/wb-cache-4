5|$|Sense and <b>Sensibility</b> was {{aired in}} three parts, {{with the first}} shown on 1 January 2008. The other two episodes were {{broadcast}} on 6 and 13 January. The first episode of Sense and <b>Sensibility</b> {{became one of the}} top ten streamed programmes on the BBC iPlayer following its broadcast. In the United States, Sense and <b>Sensibility</b> was broadcast on PBS, as part of their Austen Masterpiece Theatre series. The drama was split into two episodes, which aired on 30 March and 6 April 2008. Sense and <b>Sensibility</b> began airing from 26 June 2008 on the UKTV channel in Australia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sensibility</b> in {{the second}} half of the eighteenth century was {{considered}} both a physical and a moral phenomenon. Physicians and anatomists believed that the more sensitive people's nerves, the more emotionally affected they would be by their surroundings. Since women were thought to have keener nerves than men, it was also believed that women were more emotional than men. The emotional excess associated with <b>sensibility</b> also theoretically produced an ethic of compassion: those with <b>sensibility</b> could easily sympathize with people in pain. Thus historians have credited the discourse of <b>sensibility</b> and those who promoted it with the increased humanitarian efforts, such as the movement to abolish the slave trade, of the eighteenth century. But <b>sensibility</b> was also thought to paralyze those who had too much of it; they were weakened by constant vicarious suffering.|$|E
5|$|Both of Wollstonecraft's novels also {{critique}} {{the discourse}} of <b>sensibility,</b> a moral philosophy and aesthetic that had become popular {{at the end of}} the eighteenth century. Mary is itself a novel of <b>sensibility</b> and Wollstonecraft attempts to use the tropes of that genre to undermine sentimentalism itself, a philosophy she believed was damaging to women because it encouraged them to rely overmuch on their emotions. In The Wrongs of Woman the heroine's indulgence on romantic fantasies fostered by novels themselves is depicted as particularly detrimental.|$|E

5|$|With {{knowledge}} of his sexuality becoming more common beginning in the 1970s, some film historians and gay studies scholars have detected homosexual themes in Whale's work, particularly in Bride of Frankenstein in which {{a number of the}} creative people associated with the cast, including Ernest Thesiger and Colin Clive, were alleged to be gay or bisexual. Scholars have identified a gay <b>sensibility</b> suffused through the film, especially a camp <b>sensibility,</b> particularly embodied in the character of Pretorius (Thesiger) and his relationship with Henry Frankenstein (Clive).|$|E

5|$|Sense and <b>Sensibility</b> {{garnered}} various accolades {{following its}} release, {{ranging from the}} main cast's performances to Thompson's screenwriting. The adaptation received seven Academy Award nominations including the Academy Award for Best Film, though the sole win that night was for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, the only time a person has earned Oscars for both acting and writing. Thompson's screenwriting collected a further eleven accolades, including those given by the Broadcast Film Critics Association, Golden Globe Awards, and London Critics Circle. At the 49th British Academy Film Awards, Sense and <b>Sensibility</b> garnered twelve BAFTA nominations, ultimately coming away with three awards including the BAFTA Award for Best Film; Thompson and Winslet won the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role and BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role, respectively.|$|E
40|$|This article {{draws on}} a qualitative, interview-based project {{to argue that}} emotionally close friendships at-a-distance can create {{distinctive}} spatial <b>sensibilities</b> of friendship. These <b>sensibilities</b> are formed when friends move apart geographically. In part, they are composed of the tangible forms of friendship practices (such as visiting), but their main constituent is the more intangible emotional bond between friends which can extend across considerable distances. The spatial <b>sensibilities</b> of friendship thus form particular geographies of intimacy; they shape how individuals come to understand and ‘feel’ spatial distances, and influence individuals’ own feelings about moving...|$|R

5|$|Aesthetics as {{a factor}} of well-being. From the early austere {{principle}} that form should strictly follow function, {{there is a growing}} <b>sensibility</b> that aesthetics affect the physical and emotional health of those who use a building or structure. Norwegian laws concerning occupational health have for several decades emphasized access to daylight and fresh air, and it may also be that harsh climatic conditions create an added imperative for uplifting aesthetics.|$|E

40|$|Although the {{new middle}} classes in {{emerging}} markets are {{a matter of}} significant interest for marketing scholars and managers, {{there has been little}} systematic research on their values and preoccupations. This article focuses on new middle class consumers to identify the new, shared socio-ideological <b>sensibilities</b> informed by the recent neoliberal reforms in emerging markets and examines how these <b>sensibilities</b> are actualized in consumption. Through an ethnographic study of fashion consumption in Turkey, the authors explicate three salient new middle class <b>sensibilities,</b> which implicate the mastery of the ordinary in pursuit of connections with people, institutions, and contexts. These <b>sensibilities</b> crystallize into a particular mode of consumption - "formulaic creativity" - which addresses consumers' desire to align with the middle and helps them reconcile the disjuncture between the promises of neoliberalism and the realities of living in unstable societies. The article provides recommendations on product portfolio management, positioning strategies, and marketing mix adaptation decisions...|$|R

5|$|Jane Austen was {{primarily}} educated {{at home by}} her father and older brothers and through her own reading. Her apprenticeship as a writer lasted from her teenage years until she was about thirty-five years old. During this period, she wrote three major novels and began a fourth. From 1811 until 1815, {{with the release of}} Sense and <b>Sensibility</b> (1811), Pride and Prejudice (1813), Mansfield Park (1814), and Emma (1815), she achieved success as a published writer. She wrote two additional novels, Northanger Abbey (originally written in 1798–1799 and revised later) and Persuasion, both published after her death in 1817, and began a third (eventually titled Sanditon), but died before it could be completed. A product of 18th-century literary traditions, Austen's works were influenced most by those of renowned writer and critic Samuel Johnson and novelists Frances Burney and Maria Edgeworth. She considered poet and novelist Sir Walter Scott a rival. Family theatricals, which included plays by Richard Brinsley Sheridan and other 18th-century dramatists, shaped Austen's writing from an early age. William Cowper's poetry was a favourite as were the novels of Samuel Richardson. Austen's engagement with <b>sensibility</b> illustrates her debt to sentimental writers such as Laurence Sterne.|$|E
5|$|Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark {{retreated from}} Wollstonecraft's earlier focus on God as judge to God as mere creator, {{shocking}} some conservative readers {{who were not}} prepared to accept anything akin to deism. Worried more about Wollstonecraft's promotion of <b>sensibility,</b> fellow feminist and author Mary Hays criticized the book's mawkishness. A professor of moral philosophy, Thomas Brown, published a poetic response to the book, The Wanderer in Norway (1816). Rather than rejoicing in the freedom that Wollstonecraft argued the connection between nature and emotion offered, however, Brown represented {{her work as a}} failure and Wollstonecraft as a tragic victim. He read the book as a cautionary tale, whereas Wollstonecraft had intended it as a description of the possibilities of social and personal reform. As Favret argues, almost all of the responses to Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark placed the narrator/Mary in the position of a sentimental heroine, while the text itself, with its fusion of <b>sensibility</b> and politics, actually does much to challenge that image.|$|E
