Although the <b>settlement</b> <b>was</b> founded during the Iron Age, {{evidence}} exists of activity on the site as far back as 8,000BC; during the Bronze Age the hill may have been an area where funerary practices were performed. Artefacts such as a Bronze Age amber necklace indicate the site was high status and that its residents took part in long-distance trade.
