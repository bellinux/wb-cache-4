40|$|AbstractObjectiveEndoscopic <b>saphenectomy</b> is {{associated}} with a decreased incidence of wound complications without an increase in histologic trauma or endothelial dysfunction in published reports. Concern remains about the patency of saphenous vein grafts harvested endoscopically and the development of early intimal hyperplasia. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare early quantitative coronary analysis of saphenous vein grafts used for coronary artery bypass grafting harvested with the open versus endoscopic techniques. MethodsForty patients undergoing primary coronary artery bypass grafting surgery with at least 1 saphenous vein graft were randomized preoperatively to open versus endoscopic <b>saphenectomy</b> with bipolar cauterization of side branches. Quantitative coronary angiography was performed a mean of 3 months (range, 1 - 9 months) after the operation. ResultsThere was no statistically significant difference in the patency rates of internal thoracic artery grafts between the open and endoscopic groups and no statistically significant difference in the patency rates of saphenous vein grafts between both groups (85. 2 % vs 84. 4 %, P =. 991). Quantitative coronary angiography showed no difference in graft stenosis (≥ 50 % of the internal diameter of the graft) in the body of the saphenous vein grafts in the open versus endoscopic <b>saphenectomy</b> groups (3. 7 % vs 0 %, P =. 280). ConclusionAngiographic appearance and patency rates of saphenous vein grafts harvested with the endoscopic technique are similar to those of saphenous vein grafts harvested with the open technique. These results support the use of endoscopic <b>saphenectomy</b> because of the known lower incidence of wound and infectious complications and superior functional results...|$|E
40|$|Aim. The aim of {{our study}} is to {{evaluate}} which surgical procedures can be considered the ideal teaching procedure for a resident surgeon. Materials and methods. This is a retrospective study. A chart review was performed on all patients who underwent inguinal hernia repair, <b>saphenectomy,</b> excision of pilonidal sinus and hemorrhoidectomy at our institution, between September 2000 and July 2011, and have at least 1 year of follow-up. We evaluated operative time and complications comparing the results obtained by resident or attending surgeon. Results. We obtained a higher operative time among the procedures performed by resident surgeons for all evaluated interventions. Whereas the occurrence of complications after hernia repair and excision and primary closure of pilonidal sinus were similar in case and control subjects (p = 0, 1 and p = 0, 1), the occurrence of complications after hemorrhoidectomy and <b>saphenectomy</b> was significantly higher in the case group (p = 0, 08 and p = 0, 1). Conclusion. Hernia repair and excision and primary closure of pilonidal sinus {{have to be considered}} the ideal teaching procedure in a residency program, giving to the young surgeon the opportunity of reach several skills that he needs to master most difficult surgical procedures. <b>Saphenectomy</b> and hemorrhoidectomy should be considered safe only if performed by a senior resident surgeon...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Saphenous vein {{harvesting}} can {{be associated with}} wound complications, incision pain, infection, and poor cosmetic outcome. The objective of our study is to determine the difference in wound complication and infection rates between two saphenous {{vein harvesting}} techniques, long incision versus multiple short interrupted incisions (tunneling) for coronary artery bypass grafting at the King Abdullah University Hospital - Jordan. METHODS: Retrospectively we analyzed data from 1, 050 consecutive elective coronary artery bypass procedures performed from May 5, 2003, to December 31, 2007, in our institution. <b>Saphenectomy</b> using traditional Long incision vein harvesting (Group 1) performed in six hundred and fifty patients (n= 650), while <b>saphenectomy</b> using multiple incisions with small skin bridges - tunneling (Group 2) performed in four hundred patients (n= 400). <b>Saphenectomy</b> performed by the cardiac surgery assistant or main cardiac surgeon. Inflammation, dehiscence, cellulites, lymphangitis, drainage, necrosis, or abscess necessitating dressing, antibiotics or debridement before complete healing without eschar were defined as wound complications. There was no statistical difference in preoperative risk factors in both groups. Test results were considered significant when P< 0. 05. RESULTS: Leg wound complications observed more in traditional long incision vein harvesting technique (P= 0. 0005). Female gender, obesity, diabetes are associated with an increased incidence of wound problems (P< 0. 05).

The objective of our study was to compare the level of IFN-γ in open and endoscopic methods of vein harvesting for coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). Method: Ninety samples of human saphenous veins harvested from patients prepared for CABG. Pre- and postprocedure sera of the patients, in addition to supernatants of 3 -day endothelial cell culture, were analyzed for IFN-γ. Results: The mean preoperative IFN-γ level (0. 09 ± 0. 03 pg/mL) and that for postoperative sera (0. 08 ± 0. 02 pg/mL) {{were not significantly different}} (P = 0. 2). The mean IFN-γ level in endothelial cell culture from the endoscopic (0. 18 ± 0. 21 pg/mL) and the open method (0. 19 ± 0. 39 pg/mL) were not significant (P = 0. 89).

40|$|Objective: Interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) is an {{anti-inflammatory}} cytokine that suppresses lymphocyte functions, regulates {{production of}} proinflammatory cytokines, and suppress-es nitric oxide production by activated macrophages. We examined IL- 10 expression and its {{value as a}} surrogate index for nitric oxide (NO) production in endothelial cul-tures obtained from saphenous vein samples. Methods: Using 2 different techniques (the open and endoscopic), we harvested samples of human saphenous veins from 90 randomly selected patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). Endothelial cells collected from the vein samples retrieved through both techniques were cultured for 72 hours. Using a solid phase enzyme linked-immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA), we analyzed pre- and postoperative sera, {{in addition to the}} supernatants from the cultures, for IL- 10. Results: Mean preoperative levels of IL- 10 (0. 09 ± 0. 04 pg/mL) did not differ significantly from that for postop-erative sera (0. 14 ± 0. 17 pg/mL) (P = 0. 54). Mean IL- 10 levels for endothelial cell culture supernatants did not differ significantly between the endoscopic (0. 32 ± 0. 39 pg/mL) and the open method (0. 46 ± 0. 80 pg/mL) (P = 0. 30). Conclusion: Our findings indicate that endoscopic and open <b>saphenectomies</b> are technically comparable with respect to their effects on IL- 10 release during saphenous vein harvesting for CABG.

40|$|Aim. The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} safety and efficacy of saphenactomy in elderly patients. Patients and methods. A total of 358 patients with varicose veins of the lower limbs treated between January 2001 and December 2011. 213 of these were patients under 65 years old and 145 patients were over this age. We have evaluated shortand long-term complications to compare the results among young and elderly patients. Results. Postoperative complications that occurred were: infection, haematoma, nerve injury (paresthesia and pain) and deep vein thrombosis. Although a trend towards better results was observed among the young patients, no significant differences were shown in our experience. Conclusion. Elective <b>saphenectomy</b> has a good outcome also in the elderly patients. The slightly higher rate of complications that occurred in older patients is not significant and does not support advising against the use of this surgical approach in the elderly. So in our opinion <b>saphenectomy</b> is quite safe and feasible also in patients over 65 years...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Tumescent local {{anesthesia}} (TLA) {{is widely used}} for ambulatory surgery. Patients with transplanted organs are on immunosuppressive therapy and with risk for organ rejection or severe infection. Case report. <b>Saphenectomy</b> with phlebectomy on the left leg under TLA was performed in a patient with kidney transplantation performed four years ago. A combination of 35 mg of 1 % prilocaine-hydrochloride, 5 mL of 8. 4 % sodium bicarbonate and 500 μg of epinephrine in 460 mL of normal saline was used for TLA. Overall 750 mL of the solution was used. The patient had satisfactory postoperative analgesia and was discharged home on the same day. Blood levels of urea, creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and tacrolimus concentration, measured preoperatively and on the second postoperative day, were in a regular range. Prilocaine blood concentrations determined on the 4 th, 10 th and 16 th postoperative hours, were below toxic levels. Conclusion.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Varicose {{veins of}} the lower limbs have a high {{prevalence}} worldwide. New treatment techniques have been developed with the objectives of improving patients' {{quality of life and}} reducing recovery times. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate patients with incompetent saphenous veins treated using conventional <b>saphenectomy</b> or radiofrequency ablation (RF), in terms of postoperative status. METHODS: From May 2012 to April 2013 146 varicose veins patients with saphenous insufficiency, 90 of whom were treated with conventional surgery (G 1) and 56 with RF ablation (G 2), were evaluated prospectively. RESULTS: In G 1, 88. 61 % of patients complained of postoperative pain and needed to take analgesics, compared with 28. 85 % in G 2 (p< 0. 05). Mean pain rating on an analog scale from 0 to 10 was 3. 91 &# 177; 2. 13 points for G 1 and 1. 76 &# 177; 3. 01 points for G 2 (p< 0. 05). Recovery periods ranged from 26. 63 &# 177; 13. 3 days to 18. 26 &# 177; 19. 37 days, for G 1 and G 2 respectively.

40|$|Background: It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that venous ulcers result from venous insufficiency related to venous valve damages. To further investigate the pathogenesis of venous ulcers, we compared the influence of oxidative stress in venous valvular tissue on stasis ulcer formation in patients with venous ulcers secondary to superficial venous reflux disease. Methods: Thirty-nine consecutive patients with superficial venous reflux who underwent <b>saphenectomy</b> {{were included in the}} study. Patients were divided into 2 groups: with healed venous ulcers (group 1, n 15) and without ulcers (group 2, n 24). All patients were pre-operatively evaluated with duplex ultrasound scanning and their blood samples were obtained to examine leukocyte count, interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. All patients underwent standard above-knee <b>saphenectomy.</b> Extracted saphenous vein segments were from the saphenofemoral junction, the first valve along. The biochemical analysis of the valve tissues included matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) - 9, MMP- 2, IL- 6, TNF-a, superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), and nitric oxide (NO) studies. Results: There {{was no significant difference between}} patients in terms of age, gender, hospital stay, and preoperative blood levels of leukocyte, IL- 6, TNF-a, and CRP (P>. 05). Biochemical exam-ination of valve tissue showed that the levels of MMP- 9, MMP- 2, IL- 6, TNF-a, SOD, MDA, and NO in patients with healing venous ulcer were higher than those of the second group.

40|$|The greater {{saphenous vein}} (SV) is the conduit {{of choice for}} {{coronary}} and infrapopliteal revascularization procedures. Unfortunately, to harvest an SV it is often necessary to make an incision {{the length of the}} leg, and this is associated with a significant incidence of wound complications. Minimally invasive procedures have several advantages including reduced incidence of wound complications, decreased hospital length of stay, and, therefore, health-care savings. Currently, little information is available that compares traditional open <b>saphenectomy</b> (OS) versus a minimally invasive procedure, endoscopic <b>saphenectomy</b> (ES). The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare SV harvest time, incision length, and harvested vein quality between the OS and ES techniques in six nonpreserved cadavers. Each limb was randomly selected for either OS or ES. The length of incision, number of SV leaks after harvest, length of SV, and time required for harvest were recorded for each technique. (continued on next page) The table summarizes the findings of the cadaver dissections. Per limb, no difference was noted in vein harvest length or number of leaks between OS and ES. A significant reduction was found in incision length for ES (14. 4 ± 1. 4 cm per limb), but the time required for OS was significantly shorter (P= 0. 01). This study suggests an equivalent length of SV can be harvested with either OS or ES techniques; however, with the ES technique there is a reduction in incision length and, therefore, a less morbid operative technique...|$|E

40|$|Anatomic, histologic and {{ultrasound}} studies demonstrate {{two distinct}} types of longitudinal veins {{in the lower}} extremities. The great saphenous vein is deep to the saphenous fascia. Accessory saphenous veins are superficial to this layer, have thin walls with diminished muscle cells and elastic fibers. Vein characteristics may affect long-term graft patency. This study assesses the incidence of accessory saphenous veins in various patient groups and evaluates issues related to their use as coronary conduits. Ultrasound imaging assessed great and accessory saphenous veins in 476 normal limbs, in 42 patients post-saphenous vein harvesting and in 75 patients undergoing coronary revascularization. Accessory saphenous veins are found in 67 % of normal subjects. Intraoperative ultrasound identifies accessory saphenous veins in 54 % of limbs, most in the proximal calf where 42 % of all accessory vein segments are located. Great saphenous vein segments are more common in males while accessory veins are more common in females. In 54 limbs following <b>saphenectomy,</b> patent great saphenous vein segments are demonstrated in 20 %, adjacent to incision sites, indicating use of accessory saphenous veins in these patients.

40|$|ABSTRACT The current {{dispute over}} the effects of "low " vs "high"doses of aspirin should take into {{consideration}} the pharmacokinetics of this drug. In fact, different pharmaceutical formulations of aspirin may deliver little or no aspirin to the systemic blood. This was the case, for instance, in healthy volunteers taking 320 mg of compressed aspirin or 800 mg of enteric-coated aspirin. In all instances thromboxane B 2 generation in serum was fully inhibited. Platelet cyclooxygenase might therefore be effectively acetylated by exposure to aspirin in the portal circulation, whereas vascular cyclooxygenase could be spared. Thus aspirin formulations ensuring complete first-pass deacetylation should be sought rather than "low " or "high " doses of unspecified aspirin formulations. Regardless of the type and dose of aspirin administered, salicylate is formed and accumulates in the circulation. It may antagonize the effects of aspirin on cyclooxygenase, at least in acute conditions. As an example, after administration of 1 g of salicylate to healthy volunteers, when plasma levels of the drug were about 75,ug/ml, the effect of 40 mg iv aspirin (given 40 min later) on platelet cyclooxygenase and aggregation was significantly diminished. In contrast, in patients undergoing <b>saphenectomy,</b> the same dose of salicylate (1 g) gave plasma drug levels of about 25,ug/ml; salicylate was unable to prevent the inhibitory effect on platelets of 40 mg iv aspirin (given 1 hr later) but did act on vascular prostacyclin.

Venous production of prostacyclin (PGI 2), thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2) and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) was assessed by bioassay and/or radioimmunologic assays as appropriate. Fragments of saphenous veins from varicosed patients produced significantly less PGI 2 and more TXA 2 and PGE 2 than those from the control patients. Addition of arachidonic acid to incubation mixtures dose de-pendently increased release of these prostanoids, but the levels of PGI 2 pro-duced were consistently lower in veins from varicosed patients. No {{differences were found in}} varicosed patients between various segments of the same vein, no matter whether macroscopically affected or unaffected. These results demon-strate that the cyclooxygenase pathway in the venous wall of subjects with vari-cosis is shifted toward lesser {{formation of}} PGI 2 and higher production of proaggregatory and proinflammatory prostanoids such as PGE 2 and TXA 2.

40|$|Introduction. Necrotizing {{fasciitis}} is a rare, progressive {{bacterial infection}} of superficial fascia followed by secondary subcutaneous tissue necrosis. We pressented {{a patient with}} massive fulminant lifethreatening necrotising fasciitis after bellow-knee femoro-popliteal vein bypass grafting successfully treated by antibiotics, surgical debridement and final skin reconstruction using the Tierch method. Case report. A 61 -year-old patient was ad-mitted to the Vascular Surgery Clinic for below-knee femoro-popliteal bypass grafting. He complained of intermittent claudication in the left leg after 50 m, ankle brachial indexes were 0. 45 {{on the left and}} 1. 0 on the right side. Femoropopliteal below-knee bypass grafting was done using the autologous great saphenous vein. In the very next day, initial signs of skin infection appeared including local inflammation, erythema, swelling and cellulitis restricted to <b>saphenectomy</b> site. These changes had rapidly spread in the following days on the deep tissue of the whole upper and lower leg, including the groin and with clinical signs of life-threatening systemic infection. Immediate surgical debridement was done followed by extensive wound packing and wide spectrum antibiotics administration for the next 33 days when final skin reconstruction by the Tierch method was performed. Interesting point is that this entire time wound swab was sterile. Conclusion. In the presented case immediate surgical debridement, wide spectrum antibiotics administration and consistent wound packing gave satisfactory results in this life-threatening systemic infection. Wound swab is not always a reliable indicator of the infection while clinical findings and surgeons’ experience are of great significance in rapid reaction to this rare surgical complication.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare different quantitation parameters of venous reflux by duplex scan in different venous disease manifestations. Duplex scan is a new modality to quantify venous reflux. Several studies propose different parameters. In addition, there is controversy about the importance of deep and superficial involvement in different disease manifestations. It is not clear whether there is an increased venous reflux associated with varied clinical stages. Venous conditions were classified in seven stages and their differences for several quantitation variables studied. Most quantitation variables, such as average and peak velocity, average and peak flow, and reflux volume disclosed significantly increased reflux from normal, pain only, and edema group to varicose vein, with or without edema, to lipodermatosclerosis and ulcer groups at every location in the lower extremity. Reflux time was not as consistent as other variables. Totalization of the results of every parameter for the whole extremity points to an increased reflux from pain only to edema and from lipodermatosclerosis to ulcer group. Chronic edema is not usually associated with increased venous reflux. The greater saphenous vein (superficial system) seems to be the main contributor to reflux in all stages of disease. Different quantitation methods of venous reflux are equivalent. Increased deep and superficial reflux and its totalization are associated with a more advanced disease stage. Reflux time may be the least useful variable. Chronic edema is frequently not associated with venous reflux. Greater <b>saphenectomy</b> may be the most useful intervention, even in the presence of deep vein reflux...|$|E
40|$|Abnormal venous valvular {{function}} {{may produce}} venous reflux and venous insufficiency. While valvular agenesis is a known, but rare cause of venous insufficiency. While valvular agenesis is a known, but rare cause of venous insufficiency, little {{work has been}} done on the relative number of greater saphenous vein (GSV) valves in patients with venous insufficiency. This study investigates whether the GSV in patients with symptomatic venous insufficiency has fewer valves than the GSV of patients without venous insufficiency. The number of GSV valves in patients (n = 51) with symptomatic venous insufficiency undergoing <b>saphenectomy</b> (VI) were compared with the number of GSV valves in patients (n = 26) without venous insufficiency undergoing in situ GSV bypass under angioscopic surveillance who served as a control group. The two groups differed, as expected, in age and sex distribution. The VI group had a mean of 25. 7 ± 11. 0 centimeters of GSV between valves, while the control group had 19. 0 ± 9. 7 centimeters of GSV between valves (F = 6. 99; p = 0. 01). The mean number of valves in the saphenous veins of the two groups also differed significantly: VI = 2. 3 ± 0. 83 versus control (CTRL) = 4. 8 ± 2. 01 (F = 61. 86; p 3 ̆c 0. 0001). That properly functioning valve leaflets help maintain physiologic antegrade venous flow is indisputable. This study, however, suggests that the relative lack of valves {{may be related to the}} development of venous insufficiency. This report documents that patients with symptomatic reflux in the GSV have significantly fewer valves than patients with apparently normal functioning saphenous veins...|$|E
40|$|Aim. Chronic venous ulcer {{treatment}} is often time consuming and requires {{a high degree}} of compliance from the patient. This derives not only from venous hypertension but also from chronic structural and metabolic changes of underlying tissues which impair the healing process. It therefore becomes necessary to improve the ulcer tissue condition in order to accelerate the healing process. This is obtained mainly with the improvement of local haemodynamics and secondly by direct action on the ulcer. The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of a treatment with a pedunculated flap of fascia as an additional treatment of chronic venous ulcer. Methods. Four patients classified C 6 according to the CEAP classification were treated for chronic venous ulcer with correction of venous hypertension (<b>saphenectomy</b> or ligature of incompetent perforating veins). The patients also underwent rotation of a fascial pedunculated flap transferred from the sural area to the perimalleolar area. After 7 - 15 days they had a free skin graft in the treated area. Results. All patients were discharged on the 3 rd postoperative day after the flap rotation. In 3 patients the ulcer healed within 30 days and in a 4 th patient within 45 days. No recurrence was observed. Conclusion. With this method the healing time seems to be shortened compared to the typical evolution in patients treated with only reflux control followed by conservative therapy. Associating fascial flap in the treatment of chronic venous ulcers improves the bed on which the free skin graft is applied. We can also hypothesize that this procedure restores the aponeurotic barrier between deep venous circulation and superficial microcirculation with the ensuing improvement in local venous hypertension...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurpose: This study {{assessed}} {{clinical outcomes}} of two catheter-based endovenous procedures to eliminate or greatly mitigate saphenous vein reflux. Materials and Methods: A computer-controlled, dedicated generator and two catheter designs {{were used to}} treat 210 patients at 16 private clinic and university centers in Europe. The Closure catheter applied resistive heating over long vein lengths to cause maximum wall contraction for permanent obliteration; the Restore catheter induced a short subvalvular constriction to improve the competence of mobile but nonmeeting leaflets. Results: Closure treatment caused acute obliteration in 141 (93 %) of 151 limbs; Restore treatment, shrinking one or more valves, acutely reduced reflux to less than 1 second in 41 (60 %) of 68 limbs. Closure treatments were associated with early recanalization (6 %), paresthesias (thigh, 9 %; leg, 51 %; P <. 001), 3 skin burns, and 3 deep-vein thrombus extensions, with 1 embolism. Restore treatments were thrombogenic (16 %) despite prophylactic anticoagulation, and treated valves enlarged over 6 weeks, becoming less competent. Clinical Efficacy Assessment Project clinical class was significantly improved after both treatments, up to 1 year. At 6 months, 87 % of 53 Closure patients were class 0 or 1, 75 % were symptom-free, and 96 % of 55 treated limbs were completely free of reflux. Fourteen of 31 Restore patients (45 %) had no symptoms, but 55 % were class 2 or lower and only 19 % had less than 1 -second reflux. Conclusion: Closure treatment is clinically effective, albeit with offsetting complications and early failures; these are being addressed through four procedural modifications. Restore valve shrinking, although conceptually attractive, is too problematic to be competitive with Closure treatment or <b>saphenectomy.</b> (J Vasc Surg 2000; 32 : 330 - 42. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurpose: We {{assessed}} the etiology and {{the prevalence of}} peripheral arterial and venous disease in leg ulcers in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic sclerosis and analyzed the outcome after treatment of macrovascular disease. Methods: A clinical study on 15 consecutive patients with chronic leg ulcers in collagen vascular disease (nine patients with rheumatoid arthritis, six patients with systemic sclerosis) {{was carried out in}} a referral center. Angiography was used when the ankle-arm index was less than 0. 8; venography was used when venous reflux was detectable by means of a hand-held Doppler examination. Therapies included percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (seven patients), femoropopliteal bypass grafting surgery (one patient), <b>saphenectomy</b> of the greater saphenous vein (six patients), and split skin graft (11 patients). Results: All patients with rheumatoid arthritis exhibited a multifactorial etiology of their ulcers: four of nine patients had peripheral arterial disease, and five of nine patients had venous insufficiency. In one of these patients, arterial and venous disease was combined. Five of six patients with systemic sclerosis exhibited a multifactorial etiology of their ulcers: three of six patients had peripheral arterial disease, and three of six patients had venous insufficiency. One of these patients had both arterial and venous disease. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, healing was achieved in six of nine patients, and marked improvement occurred in two of nine patients. A below-knee amputation was necessary in one patient with rheumatoid vasculitis. In patients with systemic sclerosis, healing was achieved in three of six patients, and marked improvement occurred in the other three patients. Conclusion: Most leg ulcers in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic sclerosis disclose a multifactorial etiology. Relevant arterial and venous disease can be found in approximately half the patients. Our study suggests that revascularization and vein surgery improve the healing of leg ulcers in patients with collagen vascular disease. A prospective trial is now required to confirm these results.

The identification of preventable risk factors could reduce infection-related morbidity and cost and improve patient management. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify the risk factors associated with lower-limb cellulitis, including both analysis of risk factors associated with cellulitis in either limb and risk factors in a single limb associated with cellulitis in the same limb. We placed particular emphasis on dermatophytic infections of the foot and bacterial infection and colonization of the toe webs. METHODS: We conducted a prospective case-control study of 100 subjects with cellulitis and 200 control subjects, matched for age and sex, who were admitted to a university hospital during the period October 2000 -February 2004. Data were obtained with a questionnaire and from examination of lower limbs and microbiological analyses of samples from the feet. RESULTS: The median age of the participants was 66. 5 years (interquartile range, 48. 8 - 77. 0). The following risk factors were strongly and independently associated with cellulitis: previous history of cellulitis (OR, 31. 04; 95 % CI, 4. 15 - 232. 20), the presence of Staphylococcus aureus and/or beta -hemolytic streptococci in the toe webs (OR, 28. 97; 95 % CI, 5. 47 - 153. 48), presence of leg erosions or ulcers (OR, 11. 80; 95 % CI, 2. 47 - 56. 33), and prior <b>saphenectomy</b> (OR, 8. 49; 95 % CI, 1. 62 - 44. 52). Tinea pedis interdigitalis was associated with cellulitis only when toe web bacteria were excluded from the analysis (OR, 3. 86; 95 % CI, 1. 32 - 11. 27). CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for acute bacterial cellulitis in hospitalized patients include predisposing factors and the presence of sites of pathogen entry on legs and toe webs. These findings indicate that improved awareness and management of toe web intertrigo, which may harbor bacterial pathogens, and other skin lesions might reduce the incidence of cellulitis...|$|E

Chirurgia Vascolare 1, Azienda Ospedaliera Città della Salute e della Scienza di Torino, Torino, Italy Abstract: Challenges to {{the widely}} {{accepted}} concept of retrograde progression of superficial venous insufficiency (SVI) {{have come from}} studies showing that the conventional descending paradigm is unable to account for many clinical presentations that would be better explained by the ascending hypothesis for the condition. Evidence substantiating this hypothesis holds therapeutic importance because, if confirmed, it would further weaken the rationale for aggressive surgery, {{in keeping with the}} general trend for alternative procedures. To evaluate the progression of SVI we performed echo Doppler examinations twice yearly for 5 years (ten examinations per patient) in 100 patients with SVI in which superficial venous branches (suprafascial) or segments of saphenous vein were incontinent, while the saphenofemoral junction was continent. Ascending progression of SVI was found in about 76 % of patients. In the remaining patients, stabilization of the condition was probably due to its slow natural history. Venous insufficiency initially affecting the superficial venous branches of the leg variously progressed upward to involve the saphenous trunk in most cases and different sites in the vein, sometimes involving the saphenous ostium as well. The ascending hypothesis provides a convincing explanation for the various clinical presentations of SVI and the recurrence of varicosities after <b>saphenectomy.</b> In addition to intrinsic weakening of the superficial venous wall, elevated pressure in the calf venous circulation pushing on the superficial compartments, devoid of protective mechanisms, could be an alternative/complementary pathogenetic mechanism leading to structural weakening of the perforating vein valves. From a therapeutic perspective, the hypothesis for ascending progression of SVI is consistent with the use of alternative methods that halt the progression of venous disease and preserve the saphenous axis. Anatomical and functional assessment of ostial incontinence is key to achieving good outcomes after treatment. Of equal importance are the diameter and length of the incontinent saphenous trunk and the length of the continent saphenous segment below the contiguous incontinent saphenous segment. In cases of crossectomy, meticulous short or ultrashort stripping can maintain saphenous drainage through the perforators into the deep circulation.
