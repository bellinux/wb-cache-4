40|$|Special {{considerations}} {{in the planning}} of Space Shuttle missions for multidiscipline applications are summarized. Selection of orbits and launch times, the optimum operations schedule and viewing opportunities for a given mission are discussed. Trade-offs between the limitations of a mission-peculiar <b>sensor</b> <b>mount</b> and time requirements for sensor retraction/deployment operations in the planning of the payload mounting design are considered. It is suggested that payloads which are largely automated or whose operation is not orbit-time sensitive be considered as possible 'fill-ins' between opportunity-constrained operations. Sequential scheduling of payload operations and delayed real-time data transmission may be means of avoiding RF interference between payloads and with Orbiter communications links, and of maintaining resource demands within manageable levels...|$|E
40|$|Continuous {{monitoring}} of diesel engine performance under its operating {{is critical for}} the prediction of malfunction development and subsequently functional failure detection. Analysis of instantaneous angular speed (IAS) of the crankshaft is considered {{as one of the}} nonintrusive and effective methods of the detection of combustion quality deterioration. In this paper results of experimental verification of fuel system's malfunction detecting, using optical encoder for IAS recording are presented. The implemented method relies on the comparison of measurement results, recorded under healthy and faulty conditions of the engine. Elaborated dynamic model of angular speed variations enables us to build templates of engine behavior. Recorded during experiment, values of cylinder pressure were taken for the approximation of pressure basic waveform. The main task of data processing is smoothing the raw angular speed signal. The noise is due to <b>sensor</b> <b>mount</b> vibrations, signal emitter machining, engine body vibrations, and crankshaft torsional vibrations. Smoothing of the measurement data was carried out by the implementation of the Savitzky-Golay filter. Measured signal after smoothing was compared with the model of IAS run...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In our project, we {{consider}} the problem of replicating human two-fingered grasping motions on the AX 12 Smart Robotic Arm. Two-fingered grasping motions {{are among the most}} common motions used in everyday life. Examples include picking up a plate from a dishwasher, moving a chess piece, and as we will demonstrate, opening a drawer. In fact, many more complicated motions, such as holding a pen/pencil and writing involve a two-fingered grasping component. To accomplish this goal, we designed a <b>sensor</b> <b>mount</b> positioned behind the robotic arm that accommodates a variety of sensors including a 720 p highdefinition webcam. Then, using SIFT features, we locate (in the webcam image) the feature associated with the drawer that we want to open and close defined by a point in the image. Using previous calibration and bilinear interpolation, we convert this coordinate into global Cartesian space. This coordinate is subsequently fed into the analytical inverse kinematics service which replies with the joint coordinates. Subsequently, these are given to the controller which moves the arm to a desired location. Then, using a series of movements, we can perform our task. In particular, this project takes advantage of ROS’s service/client and publisher/subscriber model. These paradigms form the basis for communication between different components of the project.

40|$|This master thesis {{describes}} the dynamical behaviour of a loudspeaker woofer and the modelling of it. By {{the use of}} the knowledge gained from the model, a feedback controller is implemented in order to enhance the woofer’s performance in terms of acoustic total harmonic distortion (THD) and low frequency bandwidth. The first objective of the research is to build a woofer set-up that suppresses the THD below 1 % during operation. The second objective is to evaluate diaphragm break-up and compensate for this break-up by the use of feedback. The woofer is equipped with an accelerometer sensor. By the use of feedback, the motion of the voice-coil of the loudspeaker is controlled. This enhanced motion results into an acoustic enhancement. Since the motion of only a single point on the woofer diaphragm is measured and used for feedback, only the local distortion is reduced. Even when feedback is applied, the surround of the woofer is radiating acoustic distortion. Initially a woofer is used that has some very specific characteristics in terms of acoustic radiation. The contribution of distortion by the surround is large with the chosen woofer. Therefore, the increase in performance measured on the accelerometer is not identical to the increase in performance measured by the microphone. Where the accelerometer is mounted, the motion of the diaphragm is improved, but the acoustic distortion radiated by the surround is not reduced. After analysing the first woofer, the knowledge gained from the experiments is used to determine a better candidate for the experiments. The experiments are repeated on a second set-up. Two important observations have led to the final result. One observation is that the surround of the woofer is a large contributor of the acoustic radiation. Choosing a woofer that is very uniform in terms of the distortion profile across the diaphragm, is advised. In that situation, when the motion of the location where the sensor is mounted is improved, the same holds for the surround of the woofer. Secondly, it is observed that when using a piezoelectric sensor, the sensor output is not only determined by the acceleration. Stress leading to deformation of the sensor is measured too. When the contribution of measured deformation becomes dominant over the measured acceleration, the magnitude of the signal is that of the deformation instead of the acceleration. For low frequencies, this leads to a limitation in terms of potential loop gain. To some extend, both problems have been solved by the use of a different type of <b>sensor</b> <b>mount</b> and by a careful selection of the woofer. The second woofer used, has an acoustic distortion profile that is nearly identical across the membrane. This observation indicates that for the operating bandwidth of the woofer, the motion of the diaphragm is a close match to that of a rigid piston. Increasing the performance in terms of the motion of the centre, therefore leads to an increase in performance throughout the entire diaphragm. In order {{to solve the problem of}} the measured deformation of the sensor, a different type of <b>sensor</b> <b>mount</b> is designed. This <b>sensor</b> <b>mount</b> reduces the deformation of the sensor. This leads to a steeper roll-off slope in the sub-resonant frequency band of the woofer. This steeper slope makes it possible to design a controller, that leads to higher distortion suppression. The achieved reduction of harmonic distortion measured on the accelerometer sensor is up to 22 dB, a factor 12, 5. The acoustic reduction of harmonic distortion measured with a microphone is up to 22 dB too. In practice, the frequency band of this high suppression is narrow. The frequency band in which the suppression is over 17 dB, a factor 7, is between 40 Hz and 150 Hz. When the woofer excursion becomes large, the THD without feedback can be over 12, 5 %. Suppressing the distortion by a factor 12, 5 therefore does not lead to the target THD of under 1 %. The diaphragm break-up is evaluated, but a controller that suppresses this motion is not implemented. A controller would only compensate for the break-up effect on the diaphragm location where the sensor is mounted. The actual break-up in the diaphragm would remain.

40|$|Abstract. An {{innovative}} temperature sonde, {{equipped with}} an ultra thin tungsten wire (10 µm in diameter), has been de-veloped to meet the scientific requirements suitable for cli-mate change research. The response time, shorter than 40 ms achieved at the altitude of 30 km, enables the temperature observations with the radiation correction of less than 0. 5 K in the whole observation range. Test flights during the de-velopment stage reveal significant artificial perturbations in the observed temperature profiles. They are identified as the thermal contamination arising primarily from radiosonde package box with some additional effect from the launch-ing balloon. The modification of the <b>sensor</b> <b>mount</b> success-fully removed the contribution from the former effect. On the other hand, some filtering procedure need {{to be applied to}} remove the latter, although the use of a long suspension line will be effective. There remain unavoidable small fluc-tuations (less than 0. 4 K) that are brought about by the solid angle modulation of the illumination against the sensor body in the daytime. While conventional radiation correction may unintentionally have taken a part of such contaminations into account, they may not be properly corrected in existing ra-diosonde data, as the origin of errors has not been identified. Our tungsten sonde that scarcely relies on the ambiguous cor-rection procedures will be ideal for serving as a kind of an international reference...|$|E
40|$|A {{proposed}} shear sensor calibrator {{consists of}} a rotating wheel with the sensor mounted tangential to the rim and positioned {{in close proximity to}} the rim. The shear stress generated by the flow at the sensor position is simply tau(sub omega) = (mu) r(omega) /h, where mu is the viscosity of the ambient gas, r the wheel radius, omega the angular velocity of the wheel, and h the width of the gap between the wheel rim and the sensor. With numerical values of mu = 31 (mu) Pa s (neon at room temperature), r = 0. 5 m, omega = 754 /s (7200 rpm), and h = 50. 8 m, a shear stress of tau(sub omega) = 231 Pa can be generated. An analysis based on one-dimensional flow, with the flow velocity having only an angular component {{as a function of the}} axial and radial coordinates, yields corrections to the above simple formula for the curvature of the wheel, flatness of the sensor, and finite width of the wheel. It is assumed that the <b>sensor</b> <b>mount</b> contains a trough (sidewalls) to render a velocity release boundary condition at the edges of the rim. The Taylor number under maximum flow conditions is found to be 62. 3, sufficiently low to obviate flow instability. The fact that the parameters entering into the evaluation of the shear stress can be measured to high accuracy with well-defined uncertainties makes the proposed calibrator suitable for a physical standard for shear stress calibration...|$|E
