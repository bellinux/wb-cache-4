The resulting surface morphologies and the wetting characteristics were investigated using SEM and the liquid contact angle measurements to quantify important parameters for enhancing the dropwise condensation.

50|$|Resin {{sealants}} {{require an}} phosphoric acid solution ("etch") to create microscopic porosity {{into which the}} sealant material can flow thereby increasing retention, increasing surface area and improving {{the strength of the}} bond between the sealant and the tooth <b>surface.</b> <b>Etching</b> time varies from 15-60 second depending on the product. After that, the tooth must be rinsed and dried thoroughly for 15-20 seconds. Chalky appearance on the dried tooth means the tooth has been properly etched. If the tooth does not have this chalky appearance, the etching process must be repeated. The sealant is then applied to the tooth and either set with a curing light or left to dry by itself. Compared to a typical dental filling, where an injection of local anesthetic and use of a dental drill may be involved, fissure sealants are quick and painless. The sealant material is carefully placed into the prepared pits and fissures by using a disposable instrument provided by the manufacturer. Overfilling on the tooth should be prevented to minimize occlusal adjustment. The material is left for 10 seconds after the placement prior to curing to allow optimum penetration of the sealant materials into the pores created by the etching procedure. Usually, curing is 20-30 seconds. Glass ionomer do not require light curing, however they will set faster with the usage of a curing light.|$|E
40|$|Surface {{modification}} of pollen-shape hydroxyapatite (HA) carriers is achieved using <b>surface</b> <b>etching</b> technique. Characterization of HA carriers {{before and after}} etching are performed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Carr’s compressibility index (CI), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Four <b>surface</b> <b>etching</b> temperatures are tested but only the particles etched at 40 and 50 °C are found satisfactory. Proper <b>surface</b> <b>etching</b> allows a reduction of the petal-like structure on the particle surface and improves the crystallinity of the particles. While the reduction of petal-like structure decreases the emitted dose (ED) of the drug particles, an increase in fine particle fraction (FPF) can be attained owing to the improvement in drug liberation. An increase in the air flow rate, however, decreases the significance of particle surface morphology and the difference in FPF among the use of different carrier particles diminishes. <b>Surface</b> <b>etching</b> technique is found to have good potential as an economical process to improve dry powder inhalation efficiency through surface modification...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{extensive}} technically recoverable shale natural gas resources {{and an increase}} in production from shale plays over the last 10 years, it is essential to focus on stimulation techniques to enhance productivity in shale resources. One such stimulation technique is acid fracturing. Similar to hydraulic fracturing, acid fracturing injects acid into a formation at a pressure greater than the fracture pressure, creating fractures and etching the created fracture face. The high carbonate content of the Eagle Ford Shale makes the formation a possible acid fracturing candidate. Minimal research has been completed on the effects of acid fracturing high carbonate-containing shale formations, where various conditions can limit the permeability of petroleum fluids. In this study, eight Eagle Ford shale samples, four from Zone C and four from Zone D, are used to determine the effect of <b>surface</b> <b>etching</b> pattern, acid concentration, calcite content, and Brinell Hardness Number on created acid fracture conductivity in the Eagle Ford shale. The resultant <b>surface</b> <b>etching</b> volume is determined by a pre-and post-surface Profilometer scan to calculate the change in surface profile. Calcite content is determined by X-Ray Diffraction analyses. Conductivity tests are performed on the eight samples up to a closure stress of 4000 psi, sample integrity permitting. Based on the results determined in this study, acid fracturing the Eagle Ford shale could provide optimistic increases in production. Acid fracturing treatments in high calcite containing zones of the Eagle Ford shale are expected to result in an increase in productivity. For the Eagle Ford Shale, the <b>surface</b> <b>etching</b> patterns that result in highly sustained conductivity values are channeling and roughness. A direct correlation is shown between calcite content of the shale and resultant <b>surface</b> <b>etching</b> volume. Furthermore, the higher the calcite content of the samples, the more likely the etching pattern will result in channeling and surface roughness.

The main objective of this thesis is to investigate the effect of surface pretreatment using acid etching and physical vapour deposition coating (PVD) coating on tungsten carbide (WC) cutting tool. The effect of machining performance on tungsten carbide cutting tool using this pretreatment in term of wear rate also studied. The scope of work include tungsten carbide as cutting tool, acid hydrofluoric, HF for etching, PVD coating process and machining by turning operation. Tungsten carbide cutting tool was subjected to acid <b>etching</b> <b>surface</b> pretreatment for 20 minutes before it was deposited with PVD coating process.

The surface pretreatment with HF acid provide rough surface to tungsten carbide microstructure. Besides, the machining test performance shows the coated tungsten carbide with acid <b>etching</b> <b>surface</b> pretreatment provided longer tool’s life compared to original tungsten carbide and coated tungsten carbide without surface pretreatment cutting tools. In addition, the hardness test indicated that average Vickers hardness of original tungsten carbide specimen was 970. 7 HV while coated tungsten carbide with acid etching pretreatment specimen was 1232. 33 HV.

40|$|Possessing the {{advantages}} of both polymeric membranes and the specific inorganic nanoparticles or nanotubes, mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) have {{captured the imagination of}} researchers for a possible technological breakthrough for efficient gas separation. However, it is still very challenging to achieve defect-free interface between fillers and polymer matrix. In this study, the naturally abundant and low cost halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) were applied as fillers for MMMs synthesis. To improve the filler dispersion and filler-matrix interface affinity, the raw HNTs were modified by either alkali etching or (3 -Aminopropyl) triethoxysilane grafting. After <b>surface</b> <b>etching,</b> the defect holes were formed on the surfaces of etched-HNTs, resulting in the rougher HNT walls and significant increment of surface area and CO 2 adsorption capacity. The filler/polymer interfacial voids and filler dispersion were quantitatively assessed by tomographic focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy. HNTs <b>surface</b> <b>etching</b> significantly improved the HNTs/polymer interfacial affinity (void% = 0. 06 % for Raw-HNTs MMM, 0. 02 % for Etched HNTs MMMs) and filler dispersion, while grafted-HNTs mainly contribute to the filler dispersion. Compared to the pure polymer membrane and MMMs with untreated HNTs, MMMs containing 10 wt. % etched HNTs filler exhibited both increased CO 2 permeability (807. 7 Barrer) and higher CO 2 selectivity (CO 2 /CH 4 selectivity of 27. 8) on the well-known limit of Robeson upper bound. In contrast, grafting HNTs only increased the membrane permeability without enhancing CO 2 selectivity. The results suggest that <b>surface</b> <b>etching</b> can be an effective route in filler modification to improve interfacial morphology and membrane separation performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.
