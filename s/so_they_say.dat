5|$|Two {{weeks before}} {{starting}} a tour {{to promote the}} album, John Hembree joined the band to replace bassist Jeremy Davis, though Davis ended up rejoining the group after five months away from the band. In February, the group went on Midwest and east coast tour with Halifax, My American Heart, and <b>So</b> <b>They</b> <b>Say.</b> Through the spring of 2006, Paramore was an opening act on tours for both Bayside and The Rocket Summer. The band was initially planned {{to appear on the}} 2006 edition of the Take Action Tour in early March 2006, but Williams came down with flu, which resulted in the band being replaced by Sullivan. The band went on the 2006 edition of the Warped Tour, which took place in Nashville, near the group's hometown. In August and September, the band headlined a tour in the United States with support from Hit the Lights, Cute Is What We Aim For and This Providence, followed by some dates in the United Kingdom in October.|$|E
500|$|Acoustic guitar, {{violin and}} drums {{accompany}} Eminem's verses. The lyrics transition from discussing {{positive aspects of}} love to describing violent events. Eminem raps, [...] "It's the rage that took over, it controls you both, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> it's best to go your separate ways. Guess that they don't know ya, cause today that was yesterday." [...] Sady Doyle of The Atlantic interpreted these lyrics as the rapper's confession to having abused Scott, as he [...] "turns the anger and accusations toward himself". In the second verse, Eminem accepts the outcome after feeling sorry, admitting, [...] "Yesterday is over, it's a different day." [...] His frustration increases and he raps that two personalities can clash and devastate: [...] "maybe that's {{what happens when a}} tornado meets a volcano". The described love–hate relationship worsens and leads to domestic violence. Eminem admits to lying about promises he makes and says late in the song, [...] "If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire", a reference to Rihanna's lyrics.|$|E
500|$|Ottavio's {{marriage}} troubled Alessandro; {{he struggled}} with the burden of chastity and entertained fantasies of marrying a princess. He resented his younger brother's arrangement; during the wedding ceremony he [...] "became more deathly pale than death itself, and, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> is unable to bear this thing, that he, the first-born, should see himself deprived of such splendid status and of {{the daughter of an}} Emperor." [...] In 1546 Paul gave Pier Luigi the duchies of Parma and Piacenza as papal fiefs, a highly political move by the pope: in doing so he gave titles and wealth to Pier and appointed a lord who was subservient and owed a debt of gratitude, guaranteeing that the duchies would remain under papal control. At the same time, Ottavio was posted to the North of Italy to support Charles. By 1546 Ottavio was 22 years old, married to Margaret of Austria and an accomplished and distinguished individual. In 1547 his father was assassinated and Ottavio claimed the dukedom of Parma and Piacenza against the express wishes of both Charles, his father-in-law, and Paul. In doing so, Ottavio acted in opposition to the pope's desire to maintain the duchies as papal fiefs, and to Charles, whom he believed responsible for the plot to assassinate Pier Luigi.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the case}} of Antonietta Vial (who was to sing the role of Irene and whom he {{described}} on first hearing her as [...] "both a bastard soprano and a veiled contralto", {{he was able to}} make adjustments to suit her vocal limitations. [...] By {{the time of the first}} performance, which was well received, Donizetti reported to his publisher the audience's reaction to most of the numbers, specifically that [...] "in the duet for Vial and Salvatore, many shouts of bravi, but at the end (<b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>say)</b> the situation is so moving that they were weeping".|$|E
2500|$|Some (including Albert Einstein) {{argue that}} our {{inability}} to predict any more than probabilities is simply due to ignorance. The idea is that, beyond the conditions and laws we can observe or deduce, there are also hidden factors or [...] "hidden variables" [...] that determine absolutely in which order photons reach the detector screen. They argue that {{the course of the}} universe is absolutely determined, but that humans are screened from knowledge of the determinative factors. <b>So,</b> <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> it only appears that things proceed in a merely probabilistically determinative way. In actuality, they proceed in an absolutely deterministic way.|$|E
2500|$|Ishikawa Goemon is {{the subject}} of many classic kabuki plays. The only one still in {{performance}} today is Kinmon Gosan no Kiri (The Golden Gate and the Paulownia Crest), a five-act play written by Namiki Gohei in 1778. The most famous act is [...] "Sanmon Gosan no Kiri" [...] ("The Temple Gate and the Paulownia Crest") in which Goemon is first seen sitting on top of the Sanmon gate at Nanzen-ji. He is smoking an oversized silver pipe called a kiseru and exclaims [...] "The spring view is worth a thousand gold pieces, or <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> but 'tis too little, too little. These eyes of Goemon rate it worth ten thousand!". Goemon soon learns that his father, a Chinese man named So Sokei, was killed by Mashiba Hisayoshi (a popular kabuki alias for Hideyoshi) and he sets off to avenge his father's death. He also appears in the famous tale of the Forty-seven Ronin, first staged also in 1778. In 1992, Goemon appeared in the kabuki series of Japanese postage stamps.|$|E
