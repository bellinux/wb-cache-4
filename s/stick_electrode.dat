The welder instructs the surface operator to make and break the contact as required during the procedure. The contacts should only be closed during actual welding, and opened at other times, particularly when changing electrodes.|$|E

O desgaste abrasivo em peças e equipamentos representa, nestas industriais, um dos principais fatores de depreciação de capital e uma importante fonte de despesas com manutenção. Para a aplicação do revestimento por soldagem, os arames tubulares têm sido uma alternativa cada vez mais viável, devido à sua alta produtividade e qualidade de solda, substituindo, em parte, o uso do eletrodo revestido. O objetivo deste trabalho é fazer um estudo comparativo da resistência ao desgaste abrasivo do revestimento aplicado por soldagem com arames tubulares autoprotegidos de três ligas metálicas utilizadas na indústria, uma do tipo Fe-Cr-C, outra do tipo Fe-Cr-C com adição de nióbio e boro e a terceira, do tipo Fe-Cr-C com adição de nióbio. Os revestimentos anti-desgaste, conhecidos como revestimento duro, foram aplicados em chapas de aço carbono, com os mesmos parâmetros e procedimentos de soldagem.

The abrasive wear on parts and equipments represents one of the main depreciation factors of capital and the major source of expenditure on maintenance in industries.

The wear resistant coatings, known as hardfacing were deposited on carbon steel plates, with the same parameters and procedures of welding. The samples were obtained by cutting and grinding and were subjected to abrasive wear tests, in a Rubber Wheel apparatus, according to procedure established by ASTM G 65 - 91.

30|$|The use {{of two or}} more {{channels}} of EMG signals implies that this prosthesis uses an extraction pattern of signals for controlling, as noted in [34 – 36]. The EMG signal can be generated from muscles. In this way, the EMG signals are received through <b>stick</b> <b>electrodes.</b> To extract the EMG, two electrodes placed on the muscle biceps or triceps brachial were used, and the third should be placed on the bone. The extracted data for sweating hands and feet control the velocity or force modes to suit the strong-willed users [30, 33]. Several authors successfully contributed to refining variance estimation of the myoelectric signal, for example, by applying a whitening filter or changing the smoothing window length {{to increase the number of}} states available from the surface EMG signal [37 – 39]. These techniques require a different muscle contraction for each controlled function, making the control {{of two or more}} joints very difficult. Because the effects of unwanted movement of the surrounding muscles create the additive noise, the EMG signal is dependent on physical condition of disabilities due to its natural characteristics. Only one input signal is used in the control system to decrease the impact of noises. The external control system with a single input can produce control command (speed and torque, clockwise and counterclockwise action). Speed and torque are obtained by the voltage domain of the EMG signal. So one of our parameters is the amount of the EMG voltage domain, and it was determined by putting two thresholds (up/down); the clockwise and counterclockwise actions were assigned. The single input senses EMG signal by electrodes on the skin surface of biceps brachial muscle. In the first phase signal is generated due to low voltage (about 4  mV) into the differential operational amplifier which amplifies voltage range (about 3.3  V) (Fig.  3).|$|R

The indefinite nature of the factors affecting TTI raised our interest in clinical study of the TTI behavior during long-term applications of the defibrillation pads in different positions on the patient's chest. The study involved 86 randomly selected patients (39 male and 49 female, age (20 - 83) years, height (150 - 190) cm, weight (50 - 110) kg, chest size (86 - 130) cm, 67 patients with normal skin, 13 patients with dry skin and 6 patients with greasy skin, 70 patients without and 16 patients with chest pilosity). TTI was measured by passing of a low-amplitude high-frequency (23 kHz) current between the two PADs (active area about 92 cm 2). For each patient, the TTI was measured 10 s, 1 min and 5 min after <b>sticking</b> on the <b>electrodes</b> to the skin surface, separately for the two tested electrode positions - Position 1 (sub-clavicular/sub-axillar position) and Position 2 (antero-posterior position).

TTI mean +/- SD value in Position 1 (107, 2 +/- 22, 3) Ohm is significantly higher than TTI in Position 2 (96, 6 +/- 19, 2) Ohm.

30|$|Stream and {{rotating}} {{metal transfer}} occur at higher power ranges. The {{rotation of the}} molten metal {{is the result of}} longer <b>electrode</b> <b>stick</b> out (25 to 35  mm) and higher current and voltage, which cause stream metal to deflect out of its symmetry axis and start to rotate under magnetic forces. Although butt welding is the most typical application of rotating arc mode welding, a rotating arc can also be used in narrow gap welding. Heavy thick plates can be welded using this method. Due to the flexibility, efficiency, and productivity of this mode, it can be used in the manufacturing of large and heavy structural parts (Church and Imaizumi 1990). Although the process is reported by Church and Imaizumi (1990) as requiring quaternary shielding (He-Ni-CO 2 and O 2), which allows very limited tolerance, Suban and Tusek (2003) indicated that a binary shielding gas (argon and CO 2) could produce satisfactory results with optimized welding parameters. Full exploitation of its potential is in completely mechanized procedures (Masseti 2010). Large-scale bridge parts, heavy machinery, shipbuilding, and heavy cylindrical structures are some examples of its applications. A new development of the rotating arc, rotation that is not due to the magnetic effect but to special small rotating torches, makes it possible to apply a rotating arc mode to fillet welding in shipbuilding, bridges, etc. The mode is also suitable for low carbon steel plates (Iwata et al. 2009 a, b; Yang et al. 2009; Christensen et al. 2005).|$|R

40|$|Hydraulic {{processes}} and soil storage capacity {{may be affected}} by the crop residue management. Thus, {{a better understanding of the}} spatial and temporal distribution of water as a consequence of different tillage methods is needed. The distribution of soil water content is basically studied thanks to soil moisture sensors such as time domain reflectometry (TDR) probes. However, this method requires the disturbance of the soil and only provides local information. Comparatively, electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) slightly alters the soil structure. It has been considered as a proxy to assess the spatial and temporal variability of the soil water content. This study aims at assessing whether and to which extent the crop residue management influences soil water dynamics and the water availability for maize. Water content will be monitored from March to October 2014, under three crop residue managements: conventional tillage realized in the end of autumn, conventional tillage realized just before sowing, and strip tillage. A bare soil under conventional tillage will also be monitored so as to better understand the influence of the plant over the growing season. So as to better understand the dynamics of water in the soil-water-continuum, the influence of the crop residue management on the soil structure and the plant development will also be investigated.

40|$|Variations {{of fluid}} densities can alter flow {{patterns}} and transport processes, if solute concentration differences are {{high enough to}} cause relevant density contrasts. Since numerous environmental problems are related to these phenomena, the need for accurate process description and modeling continues to increase. The numerical simulation of such processes is challenging due to the strong non-linear coupling of flow and transport processes. Therefore, experimental studies are required to elaborate the basic principles and to test numerical codes {{in order to provide}} reliable tools for water resources management and planning. In this thesis, density-coupled flow processes under the influence of geometrical boundary conditions are studied and numerical codes are tested against high resolution experimental data. Photometric methods were further developed to increase the accuracy of measurements in flow tank experiments. They directly related digitally measured intensities of a tracer dye to solute concentrations. This enabled an effective processing {{of a large number of}} images in order to compute concentration time series at various points of the flow tank and concentration contour lines. Perturbations of the measurements were lens flare effects and the image resolution. Transmissive and reflective intensity measurements were compared. The reflection images were more homogeneous in spatial illumination than the transmission images. Major perturbations of the transmissive images were lens flare effects and light dispersion within the bead-water-Plexiglas system which smeared the front of the plume. Based on the conducted evaluation of transmissive and reflective intensity measurements, the reflection data delivered more reliable intensity values to derive solute concentrations in intermediate scale flow tank experiments. The newly developed resistivity measurement system used two different input voltages at gilded <b>electrode</b> <b>sticks</b> to enable the measurement of salt concentrations from 0 to 300 g/l.

The two measurement approaches, photometric and resistivity methods, were compared with regard to their usefulness in providing data for benchmark experiments. Due to the unknown measurement volume of the electrodes, the photometric method was better to determine experiments in a series of laboratory-scale 2 D porous medium tank experiments. Various density-driven flow problems were investigated using well-defined experimental parameters and boundary conditions. The experiments were carried out both in a rectangular flow tank (158 × 100 × 4 cm 3) and in a more complex geometrical setup aiming to study variable density flow in geological formations of aquifers and aquicludes connected via fault zones. An impermeable layer within the porous medium tank forced the solutes to pass through a channel to reach the outlet of the tank. The porous medium was homogeneous in both cases.

40|$|Electrostatic {{actuators}} {{are often}} used in MEMS since they are relatively easy to manufacture and provide a short response time. Previous studies have already considered topology optimization of such micro-actuators like the work by Raulli and Maute [1] and by Yoon and Sigmund [2]. Raulli considers maximization of the actuator output displacement for given electric potential input locations. The paper by Yoon et al. goes further by replacing the staggered modeling used by Raulli by a monolithic approach where both physical fields (electric and mechanical) are solved at once. However, electrostatic micro-actuators possess a limit input voltage called the pull-in voltage, beyond which they become unstable. If a voltage greater than the pull-in voltage {{is applied to the}} device, elastic forces of the suspension system are not able to balance electrostatic forces and <b>electrodes</b> <b>stick</b> together. In some cases, the pull-in effect can damage the device. Previous researches by the authors [3] have considered the possibility to control pull-in voltage using topology optimization. In this first approach, pull-in voltage itself was included in the optimization problem and treated as objective function. Nevertheless, in some applications, the developed pull-in voltage optimization procedure suffers from design oscillations that prevent from reaching solution. As illustrated in this paper, the issue is similar to the mode switching problem that arises in eigenvalue optimization problems. The classical solution to this issue consists in including several eigenvalues in a ‘max-min’ formulation. However as the classical pull-in voltage optimization problem is not formulated as an eigenproblem, direct application is not possible. Indeed, pull-in being a nonlinear instability phenomenon, strictly speaking, it is only possible to compute one instability mode and upcoming instability modes cannot be captured. Therefore, this paper is dedicated {{to the development of a}} linear eigenproblem approximation for the nonlinear stability problem after the work on nonlinear buckling by Lindgaard and Lund [4]. The proposed stability eigenproblem leads to an alternative optimization procedure aiming at maximizing pull-in voltage. The first eigenmode corresponds to the actual pull-in mode while higher order modes allow estimating upcoming instability modes. Using a multiobjective formulation to maximize the smallest eigenvalue of the stability problem, it is possible to circumvent oscillation issues met with pull-in voltage optimization. Moreover, numerical results show that even if the eigenproblem formulation is an approximation of the actual pull-in voltage optimization problem, eigenproblem formulation leads to significant improvement of pull-in voltage.
