5|$|The {{first attempt}} to measure the {{diameter}} of Triton was made by Gerard Kuiper in 1954. He obtained a value of 3,800km. <b>Subsequent</b> <b>measurement</b> attempts arrived at values ranging from 2,500 to 6,000km, or from slightly smaller than the Moon (3474.2km) to nearly half the diameter of Earth.

5|$|The images {{returned}} from Galileo, and the <b>subsequent</b> <b>measurement</b> of Ida's mass, provided {{new insights into}} the geology of S-type asteroids. Before the Galileo flyby, many different theories had been proposed to explain their mineral composition. Determining their composition permits a correlation between meteorites falling to the Earth and their origin in the asteroid belt. Data {{returned from}} the flyby pointed to S-type asteroids as the source for the ordinary chondrite meteorites, the most common type found on the Earth's surface.|$|E

40|$|We characterise the {{relationships}} between preliminary and <b>subsequent</b> <b>measurements</b> for 16 commonly-used UK macroeconomic indicators drawn from two existing real-time data sets and a new nominal variable database. Most preliminary measurements are biased predictors of <b>subsequent</b> <b>measurements,</b> with some revision series affected by multiple structural breaks. To illustrate how these findings facilitate real-time forecasting, we use a vector autoregresion to generate real-time one step ahead probability event forecasts for 1990 Q 1 to 1999 Q 2. Ignoring the predictability in initial measurements understates considerably the probability of above trend output growth. Copyright Reserve Bank of New Zealand 2006 [...] ...|$|R

60|$|We are {{indebted to}} the [British] Royal Society and to the Royal Astronomical Society for the {{investigation}} of this important deduction. Undaunted by the [first world] war and by difficulties of both a material and a psychological nature aroused by the war, these societies equipped two expeditions -- to Sobral (Brazil), and to the island of Principe (West Africa) -- and sent several of Britain's most celebrated astronomers (Eddington, Cottingham, Crommelin, Davidson), {{in order to obtain}} photographs of the solar eclipse of 29th May, 1919. The relative discrepancies to be expected between the stellar photographs obtained during the eclipse and the comparison photographs amounted to a few hundredths of a millimetre only. Thus great accuracy was necessary in making the adjustments required for the taking of the photographs, and in their <b>subsequent</b> <b>measurement.</b>|$|E

It was to this middle one that the mate led me. As you entered the galley, with its litter of tumbled pots and dishes, was upon the right, and upon the left was a small room with two bunks for the officers. Then beyond there was a place about twelve feet square, which was littered with flags and spare canvas. All round the walls were a number of packets done up in coarse cloth and carefully lashed to the woodwork. At the other end was a great box, striped red and white, though the red was so faded and the white so dirty that it was only where the light fell directly upon it that one could see the colouring. The box was, by <b>subsequent</b> <b>measurement,</b> four feet three inches in length, three feet two inches in height, and three feet across--considerably larger than a seaman's chest.|$|E

It was to this middle one that the mate led me. As you entered, the galley, with its litter of tumbled pots and dishes, was upon the right, and upon the left was a small room with two bunks for the officers. Then beyond there was a place about 12ft. square, which was littered with flags and spare canvas. All round the walls were a number of packets done up in coarse cloth and carefully lashed to the woodwork. At the other end was a great box, striped red and white, though the red was so faded and the white so dirty that it was only where the light fell directly upon it that one could see the colouring. The box was, by <b>subsequent</b> <b>measurement,</b> 4ft. 3ins. in length, 3ft. 2ins. in height, and 3ft. across--considerably larger than a seaman's chest. But it was not to the box that my eyes or my thoughts were turned as I entered the store-room. On the floor, lying across the litter of bunting, there was stretched a small, dark man with a short, curling beard. He lay as far as it was possible from the box, with his feet towards it and his head away. A crimson patch was printed upon the white canvas on which his head was resting, and little red ribbons wreathed themselves round his swarthy neck and trailed away on to the floor, {{but there was no sign}} of a wound that I could see, and his face was as placid as that of a sleeping child. It was only when I stooped that I could perceive his injury, and then I turned away with an exclamation of horror. He had been pole-axed; apparently by some person standing behind him. A frightful blow had smashed in the top of his head and penetrated deeply into his brains. His face might well be placid, for death must have been absolutely instantaneous, and the position of the wound showed that he could never have seen the person who had inflicted it.|$|E
