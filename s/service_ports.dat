50|$|The RT-component is a {{functional}} unit which {{conforms to the}} RT-component specification defined by OMG. In OpenRTM-aist, RTCs have data ports, <b>service</b> <b>ports,</b> and execution context which controls the RTC's state.|$|E

50|$|ShieldsUp is {{an online}} port {{scanning}} service created by Steve Gibson of Gibson Research Corporation and hosted at grc.com. The {{purpose of this}} utility is to alert the users of any ports that have been opened through their firewalls or through their NAT routers.

50|$|In 2002 Immigrations <b>Service</b> <b>Ports</b> Directorate {{achieved}} {{its highest}} number of refusals at the border ever, 50,362 as compared with 17,220 refusals at port in 1994. The gradual impact of more visas being issued abroad and the greater emphasis on screening people pre-entry reduced the figure, as did the general fall in non-EEA passenger from its peak in 2000. By 2004, 31,930 passengers were refused entry at port and subsequently removed and, in 2010 the figure had markedly fallen to 18,276.|$|E

50|$|Q-go was {{a privately}} owned {{international}} company {{that specializes in}} semantic search SaaS, based on Natural Language Processing technology. The technology provides relevant answers to users in response to queries on a company’s internet website or corporate intranet, formulated in natural sentences or keyword input alike. It integrates automatic statistical reporting of user query behavior for businesses that want to monitor what kinds of questions their customers are asking. This is in order to adjust content to provide the appropriate information for customers and to reduce the load on traditional customer <b>service</b> <b>ports</b> of call, such as call centers and answers by email. RightNow Technologies acquired Q-go for $34 million on January 18, 2011. Rightnow was subsequently acquired by Oracle Corporation.|$|E

50|$|On October 4, 1967, {{within a}} week of being {{purchased}} by the institute, Exochorda was towed by tugboats from the Hudson River Reserve Fleet in Jones Point, NY to the Hoboken Yard of Bethlehem Steel Corporation in Hoboken, New Jersey, where refurbishing work prepared the ship to become a floating dormitory. The ship's engines were deactivated and the engine room and cargo hatches were sealed. External utility <b>service</b> <b>ports</b> were installed to permit connecting the ship's electrical, heating, water and sewage systems to land-based utility services. Deck equipment, including the many kingposts and booms used to load and unload the cargo holds, were removed, except for two masts. The hull was painted pristine white. Final preparation for students included adding rugs, mattresses and draperies. Additionally, the air-conditioning system was overhauled.|$|E
30|$|As {{discussed}} in Section 1, {{we know that}} well-known Ports, which range between 0 to 1023, and are closely bound to some specific <b>services.</b> Registered <b>Ports,</b> port numbers range from 1024 to 49151, they are used by processes of procedures and executed programs of common users. Ephemeral Ports, most implementations use port numbers between 1024 to 5000. Reserved Ports: port numbers larger than 5000 are reserved for other services. We can divided 65536 ports into four types: Well-known Ports, Ephemeral Ports, Registered Ports, Reserved Ports. The role of Well-known <b>port</b> is <b>service</b> <b>port.</b> The role of Ephemeral Port is client port. Registered Ports and Reserved Ports are linked to <b>service</b> <b>port</b> in a local host.|$|R

50|$|The Border and Immigration Agency {{was created}} on 1 April 2007. This {{was not the}} unified border force that had been {{recommended}} by the Home Affairs Committee in 2001. The creation of the new agency {{took place in the}} wake of the, still toxic, Foreign National Prisoners scandal. The publicly stated benefits were that the agency would be more accountable. The key organisational change was that of regionalisation. The new agency would be divided into six new regions each under the command of a Director. Border staff would not be regionalised owing the fact that their workforce was inextricably tethered to ports in London and the South East. The Immigration <b>Service</b> <b>Ports</b> Directorate would, for the first time, be uniformed. The case for regionalisation was set out on the basis that local teams would form closer links with other regional government offices and with local communities. The Unions suspected another motive of creating an environment where national pay scales would be ended in favour of local rates. The practical argument for regionalisation appeared to undermined by the fact that most migrants lived in the South East.|$|E

40|$|Existing {{classification}} of the Croatian seaports {{does not fit}} the level and {{meet the needs of}} the economic development of the Republic of Croatia, particularly after the Republic of Croatia joined the European Union. Equalizing public service offered by a port with the purpose of the port itself (general purpose – port open for public traffic, special purpose – port not open for public traffic) limits the economic development and aggravates the implementation of the basic market policies of the EU. Therefore, modernisation of the basic {{classification of}} ports in the Croatian legislation is suggested. Basic categorization of ports should be as follows: public <b>service</b> <b>ports,</b> private <b>service</b> <b>ports</b> and private ports for private needs of an entrepreneur. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{design and}} {{implementation}} of a data communications protocol for the Intel Data Base Processor (DBP) is defined. The protocol is termed SPP (<b>Service</b> <b>Port</b> Protocol) since it enables data transfer between the host computer and the DBP <b>service</b> <b>port.</b> The protocol implementation is extensible {{in that it is}} explicitly layered and the protocol functionality is hierarchically organized. Extensive trace and performance capabilities have been supplied with the protocol software to permit optional efficient monitoring of the data transfer between the host and the Intel data base processor. Machine independence was considered to be an important attribute during the {{design and implementation}} of SPP. The protocol source is fully commented and is included in Appendix A of this report...|$|R

So {{if it is a}} overlay port, A’s value range is (- 2,- φ). For the range (φ,[*] 2), it contains normal and P 2 P service port.

40|$|D espite many {{attempts}} to counter them,cyberattacks on computer and networksystems continue {{to threaten the}} globalinformation infrastructure, targeting datafiles, services, or <b>service</b> <b>ports.</b> Unfortunately, current countering methods—pre-vention, detection, or reaction—tend to be inefficient, inaccurate, and limited. Prevention mechanisms, for example, make attacks more difficult, but they can-not completely block skilled attackers because computers and networks have myriad unknown vul-nerabilities. Detection mechanisms monitor system activities for signs of an ongoing attack, but do not work well if the attack is novel or if the system normally behaves irregularly. Finally, reaction approaches attempt to trace and diagnose the attack path, establish cause-effect patterns, and take actions accordingly, but they remain manual and slow with little understanding of cause-effect patterns an...|$|E
