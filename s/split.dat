30|$|The {{mechanism}} of <b>splitting</b> of timber loaded parallel to grain {{is not clear}} {{and it is difficult}} to evaluate the <b>splitting</b> strength. In this research, <b>splitting</b> tests on Japanese cedar and Douglas fir were conducted to clarify <b>splitting</b> strength. A monotonic tensile force was applied to a drift-pinned joint with steel side plates and <b>splitting</b> failure originated from the pin hole. In order to evaluate the <b>splitting</b> strength, specimens with various parameters, i.e., diameter of drift pin, end margin, edge margin and thickness were used. All parameters affected the <b>splitting</b> strength, but particularly, end margin and thickness also affected the failure mode. As the end margin lengthened, the failure mode was transferred from shear to <b>splitting.</b> On the other hand, as thickness increased, the drift pin bent more at <b>splitting.</b> This bending of the drift pin caused a lag of bearing stress to timber, and the failure mode was transferred from full width <b>splitting</b> to partial width <b>splitting.</b> The <b>splitting</b> strength under various conditions could be evaluated by consideration of the difference in failure modes.|$|R

40|$|AbstractOperator or time <b>splitting</b> {{is often}} used in the {{numerical}} solution of initial boundary value problems for differential equations. It is, for example, standard practice in computational air pollution modelling where we encounter systems of three-dimensional, time-dependent partial differential equations of the advection–diffusion–reaction type. For such systems {{little attention has been}} devoted to the analysis of <b>splitting</b> and to the question why <b>splitting</b> can work so well. From the theoretical point of view, the success of <b>splitting</b> is primarily determined by the <b>splitting</b> error. This paper presents an analysis of operator <b>splitting</b> aimed at providing insight into the <b>splitting</b> error. Using the Lie operator formalism, a general expression is derived for a three-term Strang <b>splitting</b> in the pure initial value case. For a class of advection–diffusion–reaction problems the <b>splitting</b> error is analyzed in greater detail. A special case is discussed in which the <b>splitting</b> error can be reduced.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a modification of}} existing entropy-based <b>splitting</b> criteria for classification and regression trees. Trees are typically grown using <b>splitting</b> criteria that choose optimal <b>splits</b> without taking future <b>splits</b> into account. This thesis examines localised <b>splitting</b> criteria {{that are based on}} local averaging in regression trees or local proportions in classification trees. The use of a localised criterion is motivated by the fact that future <b>splits</b> result in leaves that contain local observations, and hence local deviances provide a better approximation of the deviance of the fully grown tree. While most recent research has focussed on tree-averaging techniques that are aimed at taking a moderately successful <b>splitting</b> criterion and improving its predictive power, this thesis concentrates on improving the <b>splitting</b> criterion. Use of a localised <b>splitting</b> criterion captures local structures and enables later <b>splits</b> to capitalise on the placement of earlier <b>splits</b> when growing a tree. Using the localised <b>splitting</b> criterion results in much simpler trees for pure interaction data (data with no main effects) and can produce trees with fewer errors and lower residual mean deviances than those produced using a global <b>splitting</b> criterion when applied to real data sets with strong interaction effects. The superiority of the localised <b>splitting</b> criterion can persist when multiple trees are grown and averaged using simple methods. Although a single tree grown using the localised <b>splitting</b> criterion can outperform tree averaging using the global criterion, generally improvements in predictive performance are achieved by utilising the localised <b>splitting</b> criterion's property of detecting local discontinuities and averaging over sets of trees grown by placing <b>splits</b> where the deviance is locally minimal. Predictive performance improves further when the degree of localisation of the <b>splitting</b> criterion is randomly selected and weighted randomisation is used with locally minimal deviances to produce sets of trees to average over. Although state of the art methods quickly average very large numbers of trees, thus making the performance of the <b>splitting</b> criterion less critical, predictive performance when the localised criterion is used in bagging indicates that different <b>splitting</b> methods warrant investigation. The localised <b>splitting</b> criterion is most useful for growing one tree or a small number of trees to examine structure in the data. Structurally different trees can be obtained by simply <b>splitting</b> the data where the localised <b>splitting</b> criterion is locally optimal...|$|R
