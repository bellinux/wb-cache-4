5|$|The {{formation}} of Tropical Storm Juliette {{can be traced}} back to a tropical wave that emerged off the western coast of Africa on September12. After interacting with a <b>secondary</b> <b>wave</b> over the central Atlantic a few days later, it entered the eastern Caribbean, becoming steadily better defined. Convective activity was enhanced as the wave passed into the West Caribbean on September22 and it moved inland over Central American shortly thereafter. A broad area of low pressure formed along the wave axis on September27 and convection steadily increased; around 0000UTC on September19, the system acquired enough organization to be declared a tropical depression. Twelve hours later, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Juliette. Turning northwest as a result of an upper-level trough, the system attained its peak with winds of 60mph (95km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 997mb (hPa; 29.44inHg) at 1200UTC on September30. Strong wind shear began to affect the storm thereafter, causing it to steadily weaken to tropical depression strength by 0000UTC on October2. Twelve hours later, the system degenerated into a remnant low. The low meandered several hundred miles off the coast of Baja California before degenerating into a trough on October5.|$|E

40|$|Fast magnetoacoustic wave is an {{important}} tool for inferring solar atmospheric parameters. We numerically simulate the propagation of fast wave pulses in randomly structured plasmas mimicking the highly inhomogeneous solar corona. A network of <b>secondary</b> <b>waves</b> is formed {{by a series of}} partial reflections and transmissions. These <b>secondary</b> <b>waves</b> exhibit quasi-periodicities in both time and space. Since the temporal and spatial periods are related simply through the fast wave speed, we quantify the properties of <b>secondary</b> <b>waves</b> by examining the dependence of the average temporal period (p̅) on the initial pulse width (w_ 0) as well as the density contrast (δ_ρ) and correlation length (L_c) that characterize the randomness of the equilibrium density profiles. For small-amplitude pulses, δ_ρ does not alter p̅ significantly. Large-amplitude pulses, on the other hand, enhance the density contrast when δ_ρ is small but have a smoothing effect when δ_ρ is sufficiently large. We found that p̅ scales linearly with L_c and that the scaling factor is larger for a narrower pulse. However, in terms of the absolute values of p̅, broader pulses generate <b>secondary</b> <b>waves</b> with longer periods, and this effect is stronger in random plasmas with shorter correlation lengths. <b>Secondary</b> <b>waves</b> carry the signatures of both the leading wave pulse and background plasma, our study may find applications in MHD seismology by exploiting the <b>secondary</b> <b>waves</b> detected in the dimming regions after CMEs or EUV waves.

Wave-wave interactions that produce waves at tidal periods include tide-tide interactions and interactions between tides and stationary planetary waves.

Pedra Furada provides potential evidence for the proponents of the long chronology theory, which states that the first group of people entered the hemisphere at a much earlier date, possibly 21,000-40,000 years ago, with a much later mass <b>secondary</b> <b>wave</b> of immigrants.

For a decelerating bore propagating upstream against a steep slope, its properties vary at different locations before it finally changes into an arrested bore: i. e. a stationary hydraulic jump. The present study conducted some novel and systematic research on the transformation of a decelerating bore into a stationary hydraulic jump in a relatively large channel with adverse slope. The arrested bore could be of different types: an undular jump with long shock <b>waves,</b> strong <b>secondary</b> <b>waves</b> and no breaking, a partially breaking jump with long shock <b>waves</b> and strong <b>secondary</b> <b>waves,</b> or a strongly breaking jump with short shock <b>waves</b> and weak <b>secondary</b> <b>waves.</b> All the experiments were repeated more than 25 times to yield some ensemble-averaged results {{in terms of the}} free-surface characteristics, velocity and turbulent Reynolds stresses.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimitedWaves {{in the surf}} zone are a highly nonlinear process which is evident {{by the appearance of}} <b>secondary</b> <b>waves.</b> The <b>secondary</b> <b>waves</b> appear as strong peaks in the period PDFs corresponding to the first harmonic of the peak of the wave spectrum. The strong first harmonic period peak is also reflected in the highly correlated height and velocity PDFs. Ereaking waves may be viewed as a gradation between two extremes. The period, height and velocity PDFs for spilling breakers generally were unimodal, whereas for plunging breakers strong bimodality was found. The joint probability density functions for periods and heights of the breaking waves show high correlation (0. 60 - 0. 80) which says that greater wave periods are associated with larger breaker heights. The joint PDFs of period and particle velocity, and velocity and height, suggest that the maximum onshore particle velocities are correlated with both the wave periods and wave heights.

40|$|We {{calculate}} the electron acceleration in random superluminal strong waves (SLSWs) and radiation from them by using numerical methods {{in the context}} of the termination shock of the pulsar wind nebulae. We pursue the electrons by solving the equation of motion in the analytically expressed electromagnetic turbulences. These consist of primary SLSW and isotropically distributed <b>secondary</b> electromagnetic <b>waves.</b> Under the dominance of the <b>secondary</b> <b>waves,</b> all electrons gain nearly equal energy. On the other hand, when the primary wave is dominant, selective acceleration occurs. The phase of the primary wave felt by the electrons moving nearly along the wavevector changes very slowly compared to the oscillation of the wave, which is called "phase locked", and such electrons are continuously accelerated. This acceleration by SLSWs may play a crucial role in the pre-acceleration for the shock acceleration. In general, the radiation from the phase-locked population is different from the synchro-Compton radiation. However, when the amplitude of the <b>secondary</b> <b>waves</b> is not extremely weaker than that of the primary wave, the typical frequency can be estimated from the synchro-Compton theory by using the <b>secondary</b> <b>waves.</b> The primary wave does not contribute to the radiation, because the SLSW accelerates electrons almost linearly. This radiation can be observed as a radio knot at the upstream of the termination shock of the pulsar wind nebulae without counter parts in higher frequency range.

The spectral Boussinesq model of Freilich and Guza (1984) for uni- directional waves propagating perpendicular to a beach with straight and parallel depth contours is extended to obliquely propagating waves. Predictions of the shoaling evolution of a single resonant triad with two primary incident wave components driving a <b>secondary</b> <b>wave</b> component are compared to finite depth theory predictions of forced secondary waves. Results for both sum- and difference-interactions are presented {{for a range of}} beach slopes, incident wave amplitudes, frequencies and propagation directions.

While significant progress has been made on understanding how this form of vertical coupling occurs, uncertainty still exists on how the horizontal structures of primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>waves</b> evolve with height and the processes responsible for this evolution, in part due to lack of global observations between 120 ækm and 260 ækm. In this work we employ a Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Electrodynamics general circulation model simulation covering all of 2009 that is forced by Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications dynamical fields, to assess the relative contribution of zonal mean winds and molecular dissipation on the vertical coupling of the eastward propagating diurnal tide with zonal wave number 3 (DE 3), the 3 æday ultrafastæKelvin <b>wave,</b> and the <b>secondary</b> <b>waves</b> arising from their nonlinear interaction. By developing and applying a new analytic formulation describing the latitudinal structure of an equatorially trapped wave subject to dissipation and background winds, we show that dissipation is the primary contributor to the broadening of the latitudinal structures with height, while asymmetries in the background wind field are responsible for the distortion of the height-latitude structures. © 2017.

40|$|The authors {{propose that}} the body force that accompanies wave {{breaking}} is potentially an important linear mechanism for generating secondary waves that propagate into the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. While {{the focus of this}} paper is on 3 D forcings, it is shown that this generating mechanism can explain some of the mean wind and <b>secondary</b> <b>wave</b> features generated from wave breaking in a 2 D nonlinear model study. Deep 3 D body forces, which generate secondary waves very efficiently, create high-frequency waves with large vertical wavelengths that possess large momentum fluxes. The efficiency of this forcing is independent of latitude. However, the spatial and temporal variability/intermittency of a body force is important in determining the properties and associated momentum fluxes of the secondary waves. High spatial and temporal variability accompanying a wave breaking process leads to large <b>secondary</b> <b>wave</b> momentum fluxes. If a body force varies slowly with time, negligible <b>secondary</b> <b>wave</b> fluxes result. Spatial variability is important because distributing ‘‘averaged’ ’ body forces over larger regions horizontally (as is often necessary in GCM models) results in waves with smaller frequencies, larger horizontal wavelengths, and smaller associated momentum fluxes than would otherwise result. Because some of the secondary waves emitted from localized body force regions have large vertical wavelengths and large intrinsic phase speeds, the authors anticipate that <b>secondary</b> <b>wave</b> radiation from wave breaking in the mesosphere may {{play a significant role in}} the momentum budget well into the thermosphere. 1...|$|E

After nine hours, the wave front reaches the convection zone in Brazil where a <b>secondary</b> <b>wave</b> is generated and can be clearly seen until 23 : 00 UT.
