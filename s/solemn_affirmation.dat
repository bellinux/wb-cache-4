2500|$|The Federal Court {{ruled on}} 11 February 2015 in Ishaq's favour. Judge Keith Boswell opined the {{regulations}} require citizenship judges administer the oath [...] "allowing the greatest possible {{freedom in the}} religious solemnization or the <b>solemn</b> <b>affirmation</b> thereof" [...] and asked how that could be possible if a rule requires candidates to [...] "violate or renounce a basic tenet of their religion". Prime Minister Stephen Harper reacted by stating the following day that the Crown-in-Council would appeal the judgement. However, the Federal Court of Appeal upheld the earlier ruling and refused an application for a stay of proceedings, prompting the Conservative Party to, during the ongoing federal election (in which the niqāb matter became a 'wedge' issue) craft a press release indicating the Cabinet would introduce to parliament [...] "in the days ahead" [...] legislation to ban niqāb at citizenship ceremonies. Ishaq recited the oath privately before a female citizenship judge and became a Canadian citizen on 9 October 2015, though the government pressed the issue to the supreme court. Following the election won by the Liberal Party, the new Cabinet withdrew the challenge.|$|E

Whether {{he had forgotten}} the art of Polite Conversation in Newgate, or had made a vow in those troubled times to forego, for a period, the display of his accomplishments, is matter of uncertainty; but certain it is that {{for a whole year}} he never indulged in any other sound than a grave, decorous croak. At the expiration of that term, the morning being very bright and sunny, he was heard to address himself to the horses in the stable, upon the subject of the Kettle, so often mentioned in these pages; and before the witness who overheard him could run into the house with the intelligence, and add to it upon his <b>solemn</b> <b>affirmation</b> the statement that he had heard him laugh, the bird himself advanced with fantastic steps to the very door of the bar, and there cried, 'I'm a devil, I'm a devil, I'm a devil!' with extraordinary rapture.|$|E

If Long and Beauchamp could reject my <b>solemn</b> <b>affirmation</b> three years ago, what would a retractation slowly wrung from them be worth to me now? It might once have been, but that is all over now. Even the desire {{to take care of you}} would no longer actuate me since you have Keith again; and in a few years I hope to make my child independent in money matters--independent of your love and care you would not wish her to be. Forget the troubles of your life, Ermine, and be happy with your faithful Keith, without further efforts on behalf of one whom they only harass and grieve." ...|$|E
50|$|The Oaths Act 1961 {{extended}} the 1888 Act, {{but did not}} apply to Parliamentary Oaths. All of the provisions in the Oaths Acts of 1838, 1888, 1909, 1961 and 1977 were repealed and consolidated in the Oaths Act 1978, although the form of wording of the oath set out in the 1868 Act was preserved. The 1978 Oaths Act contains provisions relating to the manner of administering the oath, the option of swearing with uplifted hand, the validity of oaths, the making of <b>solemn</b> <b>affirmations</b> and the form of affirmation. The current Oath of Allegiance or Official Oath is set out in the Promissory Oaths Act 1868.|$|R
5000|$|On {{one hand}} {{there is a}} growing moral {{sensitivity}} alert to the value of every individual as a human being without any distinction of race, nationality, religion, political opinion, or social class. On the other hand these proclamations are contradicted in practice. How can these <b>solemn</b> <b>affirmations</b> be reconciled with the widespread attacks on human life and the refusal to accept those who are weak, needy, elderly, or just conceived? These attacks go directly against respect for life; they threaten the very meaning of democratic coexistence, and our cities risk becoming societies of people who are rejected, marginalized, uprooted, and oppressed, instead of communities of [...] "people living together." ...|$|R
50|$|In the 1685 {{election}} Machell and Anthony Eversfield {{were returned}} for Horsham, though as a Whig he took little {{part in the}} parliament of James II. They were returned together again for the Convention Parliament of 1689. John Machell held his seat in three further parliaments spanning the 1690s, through the election of 1690 (with Thomas White) and those of 1695 and 1698 (with Henry Yates). He was probably an Exclusionist, and {{was identified as a}} Court supporter. Among his parliamentary contributions he advocated the rights of Quakers to make <b>solemn</b> <b>affirmations</b> instead of taking the Oath, attacked the severity of James II's judiciary, and spoke against other oppressive measures. Having been Commissioner for wine licences in 1690-91, he soon afterwards advocated a general tax on the imports of French red wines. He voted for the attainder of Sir John Fenwick in 1696.|$|R
6000|$|... (M161) The pope {{had been}} despoiled of territory, his sway {{within the walls}} of Rome itself was in {{constant}} danger, his most powerful protector north of the Alps had been weakened and humiliated by protestant Prussia. He was now to be compensated for his calamities by a majestic demonstration of his hold upon the spiritual allegiance of millions of adherents in every portion of the habitable globe. The twentieth ecumenical council assembled in St. Peter’s at Rome on December 8, 1869. In this gathering of catholic prelates from both hemispheres, two antagonistic schools confronted one another. The ultramontanes held that the revolutionary welter and confusion of the modern world could only be healed by <b>solemn</b> <b>affirmation</b> of the principle of sovereign authority lodged in an infallible pope, with absolute power to define by that apostolic authority what ought to be held as articles of faith or morals. The assumptions, the standards, the ruling types of the modern age, they boldly encountered with rigid iteration of maxims of old time, imposing obedience and submission to a fixed social order and a divinely commissioned hierarchy. Inflexibility was to be the single watchword by which the church could recover a world that, from Naples even to Mexico, seemed to be rapidly drifting away from her. The opposing school took other ground. Perhaps they saw that supremacy is one thing, and infallibility another thing quite different. The liberal catholics did not contest the dogma of papal infallibility; they questioned the expediency of its proclamation; they were for associating ideas of religion with ideas of liberty; they were not for extending the domain of miracle and the supernatural.|$|E
6000|$|The sect of Quakers amongst us, whose {{system of}} religion, first founded upon enthusiasm, hath been many years growing into a craft, held it an {{unlawful}} action {{to take an}} oath to a magistrate. This doctrine was taught them by the author of their sect, from a literal application of the text, [...] "Swear not at all;" [...] but being a body of people, wholly turned to trade and commerce of all kinds, they found themselves on many occasions deprived of the benefit of the law, as well as of voting at elections, by a foolish scruple, which their obstinacy would not suffer them to get over. To prevent this inconvenience, these people had credit enough in the late reign to have an Act passed, that their <b>solemn</b> <b>affirmation</b> and declaration should be accepted, instead of an oath in the usual form. The great concern in those times, was to lay all religion upon a level; in order to which, this maxim was advanced, [...] "That no man ought to be denied the liberty of serving his country upon account of a different belief in speculative opinions," [...] under which term some people were apt to include every doctrine of Christianity: however, this Act, in favour of the Quakers, was only temporary, in order to keep them in constant dependence, and expired of course after a certain term, if it were not continued. Those people had, therefore, very early in the session, offered a petition to the House of Commons for a continuance of the Act, which was not suffered to be brought up; upon this they applied themselves to the Lords, who passed a Bill accordingly, and sent it down to the Commons, where it was not so much as allowed a first reading.|$|E
50|$|Section 5 {{provides}} for {{the making of a}} <b>solemn</b> <b>affirmation</b> by a person who objects to being sworn. A <b>solemn</b> <b>affirmation</b> may also be used where it is not reasonably practicable to administer an oath in a manner appropriate to a person's religious beliefs.|$|E
40|$|International audiencehe {{right to}} {{education}} and academic success of all are the concerns of all time regardless of the contexts (UNESCO, 2008). Unfortunately, despite the <b>solemn</b> <b>affirmations</b> and commitments to education for all and inclusive education, {{the question of the}} effectiveness of including all-out pupils with disabilities remains a relatively unexplored topic. Inclusive education implies a paradigm shift in which the conditions for success are based on the ability of the school to adapt to the diversity of the public it hosts (Plaisance, Belmont, Verillon et al., 2007; Dyson, Millward et al., 1999). Some researchers (Armstrong, 2001; Ainscow, 2003) showed that if educational policies are formulated around the differences of pupils, they favor inclusion; such policies in addition to their voluntary nature, should provide mechanisms to the effective management of pupils at school. Therefore, one can question the quality of systems set up in France and Cameroon to host and assist students with disabilities. From the multidimensional evaluation model of the quality of school systems (Tremblay, 2012), quantitative data were collected by questionnaires from 133 teachers in France and Cameroon. The ANOVA test is used for the comparison of means between the two countries. The results show points of similarities and significant differences that will be presented and discussed...|$|R
60|$|Notwithstanding {{these great}} plans, {{it came in}} time to Endymion's ear, that poor St. Barbe was in terrible straits. Endymion delicately helped him and then {{obtained}} for him a pension, and not an inconsiderable one. Relieved from anxiety, St. Barbe resumed his ancient and natural vein. He passed his days in decrying his friend and patron, and comparing his miserable pension with the salary of a secretary of state, who, so far as his experience went, was generally a second-rate man. Endymion, though he knew St. Barbe was always decrying him, only smiled, and looked upon it all as the necessary consequence of his organisation, which involved a singular combination of vanity and envy in the highest degree. St. Barbe was not less a guest in Carlton Terrace than heretofore, and was even kindly invited to Princedown to profit by the distant sea-breeze. Lady Montfort, whose ears some of his pranks had reached, was not so tolerant as her husband. She gave him one day her views of his conduct. St. Barbe was always a little afraid of her, and on this occasion entirely lost himself; vented the most <b>solemn</b> <b>affirmations</b> {{that there was not}} a grain of truth in these charges; that he was the victim, as he had been all his life, of slander and calumny--the sheer creatures of envy, and then began to fawn upon his hostess, and declared that he had ever thought there was something godlike in the character of her husband.|$|R
6000|$|First, {{let their}} {{attention}} be {{fixed on the}} history of Christianity as learnt from universal tradition, and the writers of each successive generation. Draw their minds to the fact of the progressive and still continuing fulfilment of the assurance of a few fishermen, that both their own religion, though of Divine origin, and the religion of their conquerors, which included or recognised all other religious of the known world, should be superseded by the faith in a man recently and ignominiously executed. Then induce them to meditate on the universals of Christian Faith--on Christianity taken as the sum of belief common to Greek and Latin, to Romanist and Protestant. Show them that this and only this is the ordo traditionis, quam tradiderunt Apostoli iis quibus committebant ecclesias, and which we should have been bound to follow, says Irenaeus, si neque Apostoli quidem Scripturas reliquissent. This is that regula fidei, that sacramentum symboli memoriae mandatum, of which St. Augustine says:- noveritis hoc esse Fidei Catholicae fundamentum super quod edificium surrexit Ecclesiae. This is the norma Catholici et Ecclesiastici sensus, determined and explicated, but not augmented, by the Nicene Fathers, as Waterland has irrefragably shown; a norm or model of Faith grounded on the <b>solemn</b> <b>affirmations</b> of the Bishops collected {{from all parts of the}} Roman Empire, that this was the essential and unalterable Gospel received by them from their predecessors in all the churches as the [Greek text which cannot be reproduced] cui, says Irenaeus, assentiunt multae gentes eorum qui in Christum credunt sine charta et atramento, scriptam habentes per Spiritum in cordibus suis salutem, et veterum traditionem diligenter custodientes. Let the attention of such as have been shaken by the assaults of infidelity be thus directed, and then tell me wherein a spiritual physician would be blameworthy, if he carried on the cure by addressing his patient in this manner:- ...|$|R
