25|$|The IDF stated on 31 July {{that more}} than 280 Hamas rockets malfunctioned and fell inside the Gaza strip, hitting sites {{including}} Al-Shifa Hospital and the Al-Shati refugee camp, killing at least 11 and wounding dozens. Hamas denied that any of its rockets hit the Gaza Strip., but Palestinian sources said numerous rocket launches ended up falling in Gaza communities and that <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> have been killed or injured. Israeli Military sources said the failed Hamas launches increased amid heavy Israeli air and artillery strikes throughout the Gaza Strip. They said the failed launches reflected poorly-assembled rockets {{as well as the}} rush to load and fire projectiles before they are spotted by Israeli aircraft. While the Al-Shifa Hospital incident is disputed, early news reports have suggested that the strike was from an Israeli drone missile. Amnesty International concluded that the explosion at the Shati refugee camp on 28 July in which 13 civilians were killed was caused by a Palestinian rocket, despite Palestinian claims it was an Israeli missile.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{interesting}} thing about the way SimGolf works is the calculation of the skill rating of your course. There are three skills all golfers either have or don't have: length, accuracy, and imagination. Length {{is the ability to}} hit the ball a long way, accuracy the ability to hit the ball straight, and imagination is the ability to [...] "shape" [...] shots the way you want to and put spin on the ball. The skill rating of a hole is determined by the average <b>score</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> with each skill compared to the average <b>score</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> without each skill. For example, if the average <b>score</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> with length is 4, and without length is 4.5, you have a length rating of 4.25. The skill rating of your hole is the rating in all three categories added together, and the skill rating of your course is the ratings of all your holes added together.|$|R

25|$|Schaper's death squad was {{deployed}} in the newly formed Bezirk Bialystok district soon after the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Himmler himself visited Białystok on 30 June 1941 and pronounced that more forces were needed in the area, because the massive chase after the fleeing Red Army left behind a security vacuum. On 3 July additional formation of Schutzpolizei arrived in the city from the General Government, led by SS-Hauptsturmführer Wolfgang Birkner, veteran of Einsatzgruppe IV from the Polish Campaign. The relief unit, called kommando Bialystok, was sent in by SS-Obersturmbannfuhrer Eberhard Schöngarth on orders from the Reich Main Security Office, due to reports of Soviet guerrilla activity in the area with Jews being of course immediately suspected of helping them out. On 10 July 1941 Schaper's Einsatzgruppe was subdivided into dozens of smaller commandos (Einsatzkommandos) numbering from several to several <b>scores</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> whose mission was to kill Jews, alleged communists and the Soviet NKVD collaborators in the captured territories often far behind the advancing German front. The entire Einsatzgruppe employed the same, systematic method of mass killing across many Polish villages and towns {{in the vicinity of}} Białystok. Schaper's murderous rampage south-east of East Prussia is fairly well documented, and included Wizna (end of June), Wąsosz (5 July), Radziłów (7 July), Jedwabne (10 July), Łomża (early August), Tykocin (22–25 August), Rutki (4 September), Piątnica, Zambrów as well as other locations.|$|E
