5|$|A toxin-antitoxin {{system is}} a set of two or more closely linked genes that {{together}} encode both a protein 'poison' and a corresponding 'antidote'. When these <b>systems</b> <b>are</b> contained on plasmids– transferable genetic elements– they ensure that only the daughter cells that inherit the plasmid survive after cell division. If the plasmid is absent in a daughter cell, the unstable antitoxin is degraded and the stable toxic protein kills the new cell; this is known as 'post-segregational killing' (PSK). Toxin-antitoxin <b>systems</b> <b>are</b> widely distributed in prokaryotes, and organisms often have them in multiple copies.|$|E

50|$|Since the 1970s, the AN/ALQ-135 <b>system</b> has <b>been</b> a {{component}} of F-15 aircraft. The <b>system</b> has <b>been</b> continually upgraded. These upgrades include processor upgrades, durability upgrades, and weight reduction. Now the <b>system</b> <b>is</b> installed on more than 500 F-15s.

5|$|Another theory {{states that}} {{chromosomal}} toxin-antitoxin <b>systems</b> <b>are</b> {{designed to be}} bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal. RelE, for example, is a global inhibitor of translation during nutrient stress, and its expression reduces the chance of starvation by lowering the cell's nutrient requirements. A homologue of mazF toxin called mazF-mx is essential for fruiting body formation in Myxococcus xanthus.|$|E
5|$|In 3D video games, {{a virtual}} camera system aims at {{controlling}} a camera or {{a set of}} cameras to display a view of a 3D virtual world. Camera <b>systems</b> <b>are</b> used in videogames where their purpose is to show the action at the best possible angle; more generally, they are used in 3D virtual worlds when a third person view is required.|$|E
5|$|Many number systems, {{such as the}} {{integers}} and the rationals enjoy {{a naturally}} given group structure. In some cases, such as with the rationals, both addition and multiplication operations give rise to group structures. Such number <b>systems</b> <b>are</b> predecessors to more general algebraic structures known as rings and fields. Further abstract algebraic concepts such as modules, vector spaces and algebras also form groups.|$|E

The FDI system is used worldwide, and the universal is used widely in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Telecommunications {{in which}} {{multiple}} transmitters and multiple receivers {{have been designed}} to cooperate and to share the same physical channel are called multiplex systems. The sharing of physical channels using multiplexing often gives very large reductions in costs. Multiplexed <b>systems</b> <b>are</b> laid out in telecommunication networks, and the multiplexed signals are switched at nodes through to the correct destination terminal receiver.|$|E
5|$|The F-22 has {{integrated}} radio functionality, {{the signal}} processing <b>systems</b> <b>are</b> virtualized {{rather than as}} a separate hardware module. There have been several reports on the F-22's inability to communicate with other aircraft, and funding cuts have affected the integration of the Multifunction Advanced Data Link (MADL). Voice communication is possible, but not data transfer.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{problems}} arising {{at operation}} of force compensating <b>systems</b> <b>were</b> considered. The necessity to apply additional speed restriction <b>systems</b> <b>was</b> proved. Two approaches to implement speed restriction <b>systems</b> <b>were</b> proposed due to {{application of a}} nonlinear negative feedback of speed and with use of the motor acceleration control. The ways of considered <b>systems</b> <b>were</b> proposed, the analysis of their operation in static and dynamic modes was made. Operation simulation of speed restriction <b>systems</b> <b>was</b> performed while operating under conditions of impact of various external efforts.

The areas of the rational application of different systems of speed restriction were defined...|$|R

If the crystal <b>system</b> <b>is</b> trigonal, then the lattice <b>system</b> <b>is</b> hexagonal unless the space group {{is one of the}} seven in the rhombohedral lattice system consisting of the 7 trigonal space groups in the table above whose name begins with R. (The term rhombohedral <b>system</b> <b>is</b> also sometimes used as an alternative name for the whole trigonal system.) The hexagonal lattice <b>system</b> <b>is</b> larger than the hexagonal crystal system, and consists of the hexagonal crystal system together with the 18 groups of the trigonal crystal system other than the seven whose names begin with R.|$|R
5|$|The {{assembly}} of these extracellular structures {{is dependent on}} bacterial secretion systems. These transfer proteins from the cytoplasm into the periplasm or into the environment around the cell. Many types of secretion <b>systems</b> <b>are</b> known and these structures are often essential for the virulence of pathogens, so are intensively studied.|$|E

Known mechanisms include carbon monoxide binding to hemoglobin, myoglobin and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase and restricting oxygen supply, and carbon monoxide causing brain lipid peroxidation.|$|E
5|$|Toxins of type I <b>systems</b> <b>are</b> small, {{hydrophobic}} {{proteins that}} confer toxicity by damaging cell membranes. Few intracellular targets of type I toxins have been identified, possibly {{due to the}} difficult nature of analysing proteins that are poisonous to their bacterial hosts.|$|E
