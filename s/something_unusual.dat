5|$|The sound {{equipment}} {{was provided by}} Showco who used the PRISM system, which adapted the show for each venue according to its height, width and the coverage required. The sound was mixed by Front of house engineer Monty Lee Wilkes {{on a combination of}} Yamaha PM4000 and PM3000 consoles, an unusual choice for Spears's shows. He used dbx 903 compressors for kick and snare drums. The compressors were also used on Spears's microphones, a Shure Beta 58A handheld and a Crown CM-311AE headset-mounted capsule. Spears's vocals were mostly live—pre-recorded vocals ran in parallel on an ADAT machine during the shows, and were used to replace her live microphone when the dance routines became too energetic for good voice control. Spears's band, backline technicians and monitor engineer Raza Sufi were all fitted with in-ear monitors and headset mics, enabling rapid and clear communications around the stage area. Spears did not use them, preferring the ambient sound of a battery of eight Showco SRM wedges spread across the downstage area. These were augmented by Showco SS full-range sidefills and a pair of one-by-18-inch subs {{on each side of the}} stage. Sufi also used a dbx 160A to limit Spears's louder moments, while backing vocalists were controlled by a duo of BSS DPR901 dynamic equalizers. Effects were limited to vocal and drum reverbs. Amplification for the wedges and the FOH system were all Crown-based, with a pair of drum stool shakers completing the line-up. All the cables used during the tour were brought from the US, even in Europe, <b>something</b> <b>unusual</b> in audio production.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} much {{analysis}} of the event from critical sociological and scientific perspectives. According to critics, the eyewitness testimony was actually a collection of inconsistent and contradictory accounts. Proposed alternate explanations include witnesses being deceived by their senses due to prolonged staring at the sun and then seeing <b>something</b> <b>unusual</b> as expected.|$|E
25|$|The entire {{speech was}} being {{broadcast}} live around Romania, {{and it is}} estimated that perhaps 76% of the nation was watching. Censors attempted to cut the live video feed and replace it with Communist propaganda songs and video praising the Ceaușescu regime, but parts of the riots had already been broadcast and most of the Romanian people realised that <b>something</b> <b>unusual</b> was in progress. Ceaușescu and his wife, as well as other officials and CPEx members, panicked; Ceaușescu's bodyguard hustled him back inside the building.|$|E

25|$|As a child, Zhou Qun studied {{under the}} tutelage of his father and became well-versed in {{astronomy}} and divination. As he was born in a wealthy family with scores of servants, he built an observation tower in his residence, and ordered his servants to take shifts to observe the sky round the clock and keep him updated. Whenever there was <b>something</b> <b>unusual,</b> he would rush to the tower to see it for himself, regardless of whether it was in the day or at night. He was thus able to predict future events based on his observations. Sometime between 194 and 214, when Liu Zhang was the Governor of Yi Province (益州; covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing), he recruited Zhou Qun to serve in his administration as an Assistant Officer for Education (師友從事).|$|E
25|$|Large sharks {{species are}} apex predators in their environment, {{and thus have}} little fear of any {{creature}} (other than orcas) with which they cross paths. Like most sophisticated hunters, they are curious when they encounter <b>something</b> <b>unusual</b> in their territories. Lacking any limbs with sensitive digits such as hands or feet, {{the only way they}} can explore an object or organism is to bite it; these bites are known as test bites. Generally, shark bites are exploratory, and the animal will swim away after one bite. For example, exploratory bites on surfers are thought to be caused by the shark mistaking the surfer and surfboard for the shape of prey. Nonetheless, a single bite can grievously injure a human if the animal involved is a powerful predator such as a great white or tiger shark.|$|E
25|$|In essence, this {{technique}} is a statistical method of assessing the behavior of incoming requests to detect if <b>something</b> <b>unusual</b> or abnormal is going on. Imagine {{if you were to}} observe the behavior of normal, paying customers at a brick-and-mortar department store. On average, they would spend in aggregate a known percentage of time on different activities such as picking up items and examining them, putting them back on shelves, trying on clothes, filling a basket, waiting in line, paying for their purchases, and leaving. These high-level activities correspond to the Key Completion Indicators in a service or site, and once normal behavior is determined, abnormal behavior can be identified. For example, if a huge number of customers arrive and spend all their time picking up items and setting them down, but never making any purchases, this can be flagged as unusual behavior.|$|E

25|$|By now {{the rate}} of {{production}} of religious art was noticeably slowing down. After a spate of building and re-building in the Baroque period, Catholic countries were mostly clearly overstocked with churches, monasteries and convents, {{in the case of}} some places such as Naples, almost absurdly so. The Church was now less important as a patron than royalty and the aristocracy, and the middle class demand for art, mostly secular, was increasing rapidly. Artists could now have a successful career painting portraits, landscapes, still lifes or other genre specialisms, without ever painting a religious subject – <b>something</b> <b>unusual</b> hitherto unusual in the Catholic countries, though long the norm in Protestant ones. The number of sales of paintings, metalwork and other church fittings to private collectors increased during the century, especially in Italy, where the Grand Tour gave rise to networks of dealers and agents. Leonardo da Vinci's London Virgin of the Rocks was sold to the Scottish artist and dealer Gavin Hamilton by the church in Milan that it was painted for in about 1781; the version in the Louvre having apparently been diverted from the same church three centuries earlier by Leonardo himself, to go to the King of France.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{industries}} {{where it is}} critical to make a correct decision within a strict time limit, based on the decision-maker’s knowledge of the current situation: for example air traffic controllers or surgeons. In these situations it is common that the key decision maker is supported by other team members or by complex monitoring systems feeding them information, which can involve multiple sources and formats of information. Even in these time-critical situations, the importance of having situation awareness (SA) is not constant: i.e. it is more critical to the outcome to have better SA for non-standard situations, such as points of high information traffic, extraneous activity and unforeseeable events. These ‘points of fracture’ are likely to cause additional workload on the individuals and therefore affect their SA and the time to make the decision. At the critical point the perceived situational awareness utilized to make the decision is directly affected by the cognitive workload to gain, comprehend and process the SA that is coming in to the operator, both general background SA and the SA specifically related to the decision. (Smith, K. T. 2013) In other words, if everything is going OK the level of SA you have is not as critical as it is when <b>something</b> <b>unusual</b> happens or something goes wrong.|$|E
25|$|Recall {{memory is}} linked with {{instincts}} and mechanisms {{in order to}} remember how an event happened to learn from it or avoid the agitator, connections are made with emotions. For instance, if a speaker is very calm and neutral, the effectiveness of encoding memory is very low and listeners get the gist of what the speaker is discussing. On the other hand, if a speaker is shouting and/or using emotionally driven words, listeners tend to remember key phrases {{and the meaning of}} the speech. This is full access of the fight or flight mechanism all people have functioning in the brain, but based on what triggers this mechanism will lead to better recall of it. People tend to focus their attention on cues that are loud, very soft, or <b>something</b> <b>unusual.</b> This makes the auditory system pick up the differences in regular speaking and meaningful speech, when something significant is spoken in the discussion people home in on the message at that part of the speech but tend to lose {{the other part of the}} discussion. Our brains sense differences in speech and when those differences occur the brain encodes that part of speech into memory and the information can be recalled for future reference.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} the Spartans {{realized}} that <b>something</b> <b>unusual</b> was happening {{it was already too}} late. Shortly before the Theban left wing made contact, the Spartans hastily stretched out their right wing in an attempt to outflank and engulf the rapidly approaching Thebans. This was a traditional tactic and, once the Thebans were in range, the stretched wing would then be brought back in an encircling movement. Acting under his own initiative, Pelopidas quickly led the Sacred Band ahead of the Theban left wing to intercept the Spartan maneuver before it could be completed. They succeeded in fixing the Spartans in place until the rest of the Theban heavy infantry finally smashed into the Spartan right wing. The sheer number of Thebans overwhelmed the Spartan right wing quickly. The number of Spartan casualties amounted to about 1,000 dead, among whom were 400 Spartiates and their own king. Although some Spartans were in favor of resuming the battle in order to recover the bodies of their dead, the allied perioeci of the Spartan left wing were less than willing to continue fighting (indeed some of them were quite pleased at the turn of events). The remaining polemarchoi eventually decided to request a truce, which the Thebans readily granted. The Spartan dead were returned and a tropaion was set up on the battlefield by the Thebans to commemorate their victory.|$|E
500|$|The B-52 {{departed}} Minot at 0840 {{and landed}} at Barksdale at 1123 (local times) on 30 August.

After {{a member of the}} munitions crew noticed <b>something</b> <b>unusual</b> about some of the missiles, at 2200 a [...] "skeptical" [...] supervisor determined that nuclear warheads were present and ordered them secured and the incident reported, 36 hours after the missiles were removed from the bunker at Minot.|$|E
500|$|The name Hives, used by Shearsmith's character, {{was taken}} from a Laurel and Hardy butler of the same name. Meanwhile, Hives's costume and mannerisms were {{inspired}} by those worn and adopted by Noel Edmonds in undercover practical jokes. A related influence for the episode was a prank-gone-wrong seen on YouTube, in which a joke's target punches a costumed person when the latter surprises the former. Pemberton's character spoke with a cockney accent, <b>something</b> <b>unusual</b> for Pemberton, who normally does not affect accents when acting. In addition to playing Pete, Pemberton provided the deep voice spoken by [...] "Madam Talbot" [...] during the séance.|$|E

500|$|Celina Sotomayor put great {{stress on}} the value of education; she bought the Encyclopædia Britannica for her children, <b>something</b> <b>unusual</b> in the housing projects. Despite the {{distance}} between the two, which became greater after her father's death and which was not fully reconciled until decades later, Sotomayor has credited her mother with being her [...] "life inspiration". For grammar school, Sotomayor attended Blessed Sacrament School in Soundview, where she was valedictorian and had a near-perfect attendance record. Although underage, Sotomayor worked at a local retail store and a hospital. Sotomayor passed the entrance tests for and then attended Cardinal Spellman High School in the Bronx. At Cardinal Spellman, Sotomayor was on the forensics team and was elected to the student government. She graduated as valedictorian in 1972. [...] Meanwhile, the Bronxdale Houses had fallen victim to increasing heroin use, crime, and the emergence of the Black Spades gang. [...] In 1970, the family found refuge by moving to Co-op City in the Northeast Bronx.|$|E
500|$|The plot, {{featuring}} {{both the}} Klingons and the Organians, follows {{up to the}} episode [...] "Errand of Mercy", which had previously been adapted into a short story by Blish. The story also features references to other works of fiction. Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast series of novels is referenced {{in the name of}} an alien species called [...] "Gormanghastlies", and one of the plot points is based around a language featured in James Joyce's Finnegans Wake. It also uses the word [...] "mathom" [...] which was later considered to be a deliberate reference to J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings universe. The novel doesn't reset the universe once more to that seen in the television series, <b>something</b> <b>unusual</b> for the book line. Instead, the Klingon Empire is left unable to make any space flight for a thousand years, and the character of Koloth is stuck forever in an asymptotically slowing distortion of local time.|$|E
500|$|The {{musical score}} for [...] "The Winds of Winter" [...] was {{composed}} by Ramin Djawadi. Djawadi {{has worked on}} the series since its inception, and additionally composed the show's main theme. In an interview, Djawadi spoke about the score he created {{for the beginning of}} the episode, titled [...] "Light of the Seven", which largely consisted of piano, <b>something</b> <b>unusual</b> for the series. Djawadi stated, [...] "The interesting thing to me was the use of the piano. When we started the season, showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss, and Miguel Sapochnik, the director of the episode, reached out to me and said, 'There's something coming up in episode 10.' We talked about 'The Light of the Seven', and how it needed to be a new piece of music. Any kind of character theme could tip it, and we didn't want to tip the audience. Miguel brought it up: 'What about the piano?' We discussed it. The piano is not really {{in the language of the}} Game of Thrones score." ...|$|E
