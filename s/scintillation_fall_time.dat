Yet another paper, The Review, began operations in 1903. In 1905, The Review and The Press merged and in 1912, the News and Press merged to form News-Press. In 1911, the Thief River <b>Falls</b> <b>Times</b> was formed with the intent on taking over the two papers.

40|$|A spherical particle’s {{acceleration}} {{fall through}} still fluid was investigated analytically and experimentally using the Basset-Boussinesq-Oseen equation. The relationship between drag coefficient and Reynolds number was studied, and various parameters in the drag coefficient equation were obtained {{with respect to}} the small, medium, and large Reynolds number zones. Next, some equations were used to derive the finite <b>fall</b> <b>time</b> and distance equations in terms of certain assumptions. A simple experiment was conducted to measure the <b>fall</b> <b>time</b> and distance for a spherical particle falling through still water. Sets of experimental data were used to validate the relationship between <b>fall</b> velocity, <b>time,</b> and distance. Finally, the initial velocity effect on the total <b>fall</b> <b>time</b> and distance was discussed with different terminal Reynolds numbers, and it was determined that the initial velocity plays a more important role in the falling motion for small terminal Reynolds numbers than for large terminal Reynolds number scenarios...|$|R

40|$|Ion beam with a fast <b>fall</b> <b>time</b> {{is useful}} in {{building}} neutron generators {{for the application of}} detecting hidden, gamma-shielded SNM using differential die-away (DDA) technique. Typically a <b>fall</b> <b>time</b> of less than 1 {micro}s can't be achieved by just turning off the power to the ion source due to the slow decay of plasma density (partly determined by the <b>fall</b> <b>time</b> of the RF power in the circuit). In this paper, we discuss the method of using an array of mini-apertures (instead of one large aperture beam) such that gating the beamlets can be done with low voltage and a small gap. This geometry minimizes the problem of voltage breakdown as well as reducing the time of flight to produce fast gating. We have designed and fabricated an array of 16 apertures (4 x 4) for a beam extraction experiment. Using a gating voltage of 1400 V and a gap distance of 1 mm, the <b>fall</b> <b>time</b> of extracted ion beam pulses is less than 1 {micro}s at various beam energies ranging between 400 eV to 800 eV.

According to measurements, the digital circuit works well when the rise and <b>fall</b> <b>times</b> of the clock is varied from 0. 5 ns to 10 ns.

40|$|We report {{results of}} both {{theoretical}} and {{experimental studies of}} optical precursors generated from a square-modulated probe laser pulse having a finite rise and <b>fall</b> <b>time</b> and propagating through a cold atomic ensemble, under the conditions of either a two-level Lorentz absorber system or a three-level system with electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). Because of the finiteness of the rise (and <b>fall)</b> <b>time,</b> the precursor signal is observed to decrease with increasing optical depth (alpha L- 0). We find that the precursor can experience little absorption even at high optical depth if the rise (and <b>fall)</b> <b>time</b> is sufficiently short. At an optical depth of alpha L- 0 = 42, the normalized precursor peak intensity is observed to increase from 9 % to 27 % when the rise (and <b>fall)</b> <b>time</b> is shortened from 7 to 3 ns. Meanwhile, we reaffirm {{that there is no}} violation of Einstein's causality principle in light propagation through both slow and fast light media. In the EIT system with high optical depth, the main field propagates with a subluminal group velocity and it is separated from the precursor. In the two-level system, the effect of negative group velocity in the anomalous dispersion regime is observed, but we detect no advancement in the rising edge of the precursors. In both cases, the leading edges of the precursors show no detectable delay to that through vacuum...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} model for the {{so-called}} constant-amplitude charge-pumping (CP) characteristics, giving the Elliot Gaussian-like CP current curve (ICP-VL) of lightly doped drain (LDD) MOSFET with local oxidation of silicon (LOCOS). This method is based on modulation of the contributing active-channel area (AG) to the ICP-VL curve, depending on the position of the high and low levels of the gate signal voltage. In addition, it allows to separate and clarify the contribution of all MOSFET regions (such as the effective channel, LDD, LOCOS, and LDD subdiffusion under the LOCOS) to the amount of ICP-VL curves. We have simulated this model and compared with experimental CP data. The model shows a very good correlation with experimental ICP-VL curves, particularly for transistors with short channel gate lengths (LG ≤ 1 μm). However, as the channel gate length increases, the model matches only for rising and falling ICP-VL curve edges, corresponding to the contribution of LDD and LOCOS regions, respectively. Moreover, we have demonstrated that the deviation, which was observed between the CP model and experimental data at the maximum plateau of ICP-VL characteristics, depends on the gate pulse <b>fall</b> <b>time</b> and vanishes for large <b>fall</b> <b>time.</b> This difference has been found to behave like a geometric component, since it depends on gate length and <b>fall</b> <b>time</b> and disappears for both short gate lengths and long <b>fall</b> <b>time...</b>|$|R
