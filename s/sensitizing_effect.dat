40|$|Apoptosis is {{the central}} {{mechanism}} of cell death mediating the killing of malignant cells upon chemotherapy. Resistance of tumor cells against cytostatic drugs is frequent and this underlines the necessity to understand the underlying molecular events. That is the basis to develop strategies which are able to overcome these resistance mechanisms and to achieve susceptibility of tumor cells to cancer treatment. In the present study, TNF-alpha was characterized as a sensitizer of malignant hematological cells for cytostatic drug- and ceramide-induced apoptosis. The molecular mechanisms mediating this <b>sensitizing</b> <b>effect</b> were {{the focus of this}} study. The <b>sensitizing</b> <b>effect</b> of TNF-alpha and the implicated signaling pathways were investigated in the well characterized Hodgkin-derived cell line HD-MyZ. Despite the complete resistance of HD-MyZ cells to TNF-alpha itself, TNF-alpha sensitized for cell death triggered by etoposide, epirubicin and C 2 -ceramide. The expression of a dominant-negative I-kappa B-alpha (IkappaBdn) resulted in the disruption of the NF-kappa-signaling pathway and blocked the expression of the anti-apoptotic gene, hiap- 1. While HD-MyZ IkappaBdn cells were more sensitive for drug-induced apoptosis, the <b>sensitizing</b> <b>effect</b> of TNF-alpha was not effected upon blocking of the NF-kappa B-signaling. The sensitization by TNF-alpha led to a better activation of the mitochondrial apoptosome and the downstream caspase cascade, i. e. caspase- 3. Functional experiments showed that interconnecting signaling pathways which link the death receptor signaling to the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis are not the underlying mechanism in the cell line modell of HD-MyZ since no caspase- 8 or bid cleavage was observed. Furthermore, caspase- 8 inhibition could not prevent the <b>sensitizing</b> <b>effect</b> of TNF-alpha. Additionally, the activation of the sphingomyelin second messenger pathway as cause for the sensitizing by TNF-alpha was excluded. The <b>sensitizing</b> <b>effect</b> of TNF-alpha was not restricted to the Hodgkin cell line HD-MyZ as TNF-alpha also augmented the drug-induced apoptosis of different chronic and acute leukemia-derived cell lines and the Burkitt-like lymphoma line BJAB. Therefore, activators of this sensitizing pathway could represent a useful strategy to improve chemotherapy of hematological malignancies and could also be the basis for novel drug design...|$|E

Patch-clamp studies revealed that CrMP decreases the open probability of a tetraethylammonium-sensitive (TEA-sensitive) 105 pS K channel in interlobar artery smooth muscle cells, and that this effect of CrMP is reversed by CO.

40|$|As single agents, {{chemical}} inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) are nontoxic {{and have}} clinical efficacy against BRCA 1 - and BRCA 2 -deficient tumors. PARP inhibitors also enhance the cytotoxicity of ionizing radiation and alkylating agents but will only improve clinical outcomes if tumor sensitization exceeds effects on normal tissues. It {{is unclear how}} tumor DNA repair proficiency affects the degree of sensitization. We have previously shown that the radiosensitizing effect of PARP inhibition requires DNA replication and will therefore affect rapidly proliferating tumors more than normal tissues. Because many tumors exhibit defective DNA repair, we investigated the impact of double-strand break (DSB) repair integrity on the <b>sensitizing</b> <b>effects</b> of the PARP inhibitor olaparib. Sensitization to ionizing radiation and the alkylating agent methylmethane sulfonate was enhanced in DSB repair–deficient cells. In Artemis −/− and ATM −/− mouse embryo fibroblasts, sensitization was replication dependent and associated with defective repair of replication-associated damage. Radiosensitization of Ligase IV− −/− mouse embryo fibroblasts was independent of DNA replication and is explained by inhibition of "alternative" end joining. After methylmethane sulfonate treatment, PARP inhibition promoted replication-independent accumulation of DSB, repair of which required Ligase IV.

40|$|Ovarian {{control of}} gonadotrophin {{secretion}} is normally achieved via the feedback mechanisms mediated by oestradiol and progesterone. Evidence {{has been provided}} that nonsteroidal substances, such as inhibin A and B, participate in the negative feedback control of FSH secretion. Another nonsteroidal ovarian substance is gonadotrophin surge-attenuating factor (GnSAF), the activity of which is particularly evident in women undergoing ovulation induction. Accumulating evidence has suggested that GnSAF plays a physiological role during the menstrual cycle. In particular, this factor antagonizes the <b>sensitizing</b> <b>effect</b> of oestradiol on the pituitary response to gonadotrophin-releasing hormone during the follicular phase of the cycle. A hypothesis has been developed that, in the late follicular phase, the activity of GnSAF is reduced and this facilitates the <b>sensitizing</b> <b>effect</b> of oestradiol on the pituitary, thus enforcing the massive discharge of gonadotrophins at the midcycle LH surge. The interaction of oestradiol, progesterone and GnSAF on the hypothalamic-pituitary system provides a novel approach to explain the mechanisms which control LH secretion during the normal menstrual cycle.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which thymosin β 4 (Tβ 4) regulates the inflammatory response to injury are poorly understood. Previously, we demonstrated that ectopic Tβ 4 treatment inhibits injury-induced proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production. We have also shown that Tβ 4 suppresses TNF-α-mediated NF-κB activation. Herein, we present novel evidence that Tβ 4 directly targets the NF-κB RelA/p 65 subunit. We find that enforced expression of Tβ 4 interferes with TNF-α-mediated NF-κB activation, as well as downstream IL- 8 gene transcription. These activities are independent of the G-actin-binding properties of Tβ 4. Tβ 4 blocks RelA/p 65 nuclear translocation and targeting to the cognate κB site in the proximal region of the IL- 8 gene promoter. Tβ 4 also inhibits the <b>sensitizing</b> <b>effects</b> of its intracellular binding partners, PINCH- 1 and ILK, on NF-κB activity after TNF-α stimulation. The identification of a functional regulatory role by Tβ 4 and the focal adhesion proteins PINCH- 1 and ILK on NF-κB activity in this study opens a new window for scientific exploration of how Tβ 4 modulates inflammation.

Methods Mice were exposed to mSPS, which includes: 2 -h restraint, 10 -min group forced swim, 15 -min exposure to rat bedding odor, and diethyl ether exposure until unconsciousness or control conditions. Seven days following mSPS exposure, the locomotor <b>sensitizing</b> <b>effects</b> of EtOH were assessed.

Here we show that the fibroblast growth factor- 1 (FGF- 1), that is expressed on dopamine and GABA neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA), is involved in the <b>sensitizing</b> <b>effects</b> of morphine. The receptor FGFR- 1 is expressed on VTA astrocytes, as well as dopamine and GABA neurons. FGF- 1 or anti-FGF- 1 infusions into the VTA during the induction (not expression) phase of sensitization advanced or blocked morphine's activating motor effects respectively, in a dose-dependent manner. Infusions into the adjacent substantia nigra, whose neurons also express FGF- 1 and FGFR- 1, did not modify normal morphine-induced sensitization. Biochemical traits related to morphine's <b>sensitizing</b> <b>effects</b> were altered by intra-VTA anti-FGF- 1 because morphine-induced upregulation of both tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and N-methyl d-aspartate glutamate receptor 1 (NMDAR 1) in the VTA was blocked after anti-FGF- 1. Changes in the activation state of VTA calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase type II seem to participate in FGF- 1 -induced effects as well.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the {{possibility}} to obtain an efficient downconverting waveguide which combines the quantum cutting properties of Tb 3 +/Yb 3 + codoped materials with the optical <b>sensitizing</b> <b>effects</b> provided by silver doping. The preparation of 70 SiO 2 – 30 HfO 2 glass and glass-ceramic waveguides by sol-gel route, followed by Ag doping by immersion in molten salt bath is reported. The films were subsequently annealed in air to induce the migration and/or aggregation of the metal ions. Results of compositional and optical characterization are given, providing evidence for the successful introduction of Ag in the films, while the photoluminescence emission is strongly dependent on the annealing conditions. These films could find potential applications as downshifting layers to increase the efficiency of PV solar cell...|$|R
