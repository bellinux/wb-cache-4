50|$|<b>Skip</b> <b>counting</b> is a {{mathematics}} technique {{taught as}} a kind of multiplication in reform mathematics textbooks such as TERC. In older textbooks, this technique is called counting by twos (threes, fours, etc.).|$|R
2500|$|In math, kindergartners {{usually do}} single digit {{addition}} and subtraction, learn to count with [...] "more or less" [...] games, {{become acquainted with}} a clock, and learn <b>skip</b> <b>counting</b> {{to prepare them for}} one digit multiplication.|$|R
5000|$|In <b>skip</b> <b>counting</b> by twos, {{a person}} can count to 10 by only naming every other number: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. [...] Combining the base (two, in this example) {{with the number of}} groups (five, in this example) {{produces}} the standard multiplication equation: two multiplied by five equals ten.|$|R
3000|$|The <b>skipped</b> <b>count</b> of an ordered pair of trainings 〈 a [...] b 〉 (among a given set of {{sequences}}) {{is the sum}} of {{the counts}} of the trigrams of the form 〈 a [...] x [...] b 〉, where x is any training. We define the co-occurrence count of a bigram 〈 a [...] b 〉 as the number of sequences in which both a and b occur, but not necessarily in the same order, and not necessarily next to each other (i.e. with any number of other elements between them). The inverse count of the bigram 〈 a [...] b 〉 is the count of the bigram 〈 b [...] a 〉. In our example, for the bigram 〈 c [...] d 〉 the <b>skipped</b> <b>count</b> is 2, the co-occurrence count is 9, and the inverse count is 1.|$|R
50|$|In 1995, {{the first}} three books in Murphy’s 63 book MathStart were {{published}} by HarperCollins Children’s Books. MathStart books teach mathematical skills such as identifying patterns, <b>skip</b> <b>counting</b> and solving for unknowns {{through a combination of}} storytelling and visual learning strategies. The series is divided into 3 levels for children ages Pre-K through Grade 4. Taken separately, the 21 Level 1 books comprise one of the largest Pre-K math series available.|$|R
40|$|Using {{a design}} approach, this study {{monitors}} {{the growth in}} mathematics learning of ten Kindergarten students engaged in a Pattern and Structure Mathematics Awareness Program (PASMAP) over 15 weekly teaching episodes. Pre- and post- interviews using a Pattern and Structure Assessment (PASA) and standardised measures indicated substantial growth across number, measurement and geometry concepts. Qualitative analyses of digital recordings and students’ representations provided complementary evidence of their invented symbolisations and generalisations in repetitions and growing patterns. Improvements in mathematical processes such as <b>skip</b> <b>counting,</b> multiplicative thinking, unitising and partitioning, similarity and congruence, and area measurement were observed. 8 page(s...|$|R
30|$|The {{construction}} of a TNS is marked by constructing composite units of counting acts (like the composite unit of 4 that represented the subsequence from 8 to 12) {{that can be used}} in further operations (like the repeated use of “counting by 3 ” as a unit of measure in Cupcake Task A). In general, composite units are units composed of multiple smaller units such that the student can treat them as a single unit while remaining aware of the constituent units contained within it. Therefore, when solving Cupcake Task A, a student who has constructed a TNS can form the goal of figuring out how many times they count by 3, a composite unit, to get to 39. In general, use of a TNS would be indicated by <b>skip</b> <b>counting</b> or repeated addition to solve multiplication or division problems 2 (Olive, 2001; Ulrich, 2015).|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a physical computing application that helps kindergarten and early elementary students learn and practice basic math skills. Similar to hopscotch or jump rope, this application uses physical activity to reinforce basic math skills (like <b>skip</b> <b>counting).</b> At {{the same time}} SmartStep hones motor skills, pattern recognition, rhythm and coordination. The hardware component consists of nine, differently colored, 12 ” square floor tiles arranged in a 3 � 3 grid, connected to the computer through a MIDI interface. The student interface is a 3 � 3 grid of cells in a table that mirrors {{the arrangement of the}} floor tiles. Each cell presents a sequence of numbers required to play the math game. Visual and auditory feedback accompanies each hop a student makes on the floor tiles. The teacher’s interface allows them to create math games and set their parameters through easy to use forms and pull-down menus. These games can be saved to create libraries of exercises for individual learners or groups...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{longitudinal}} case {{study was to investigate}} the progressive development of unitizing in a cohort of students receiving reform-oriented mathematics instruction. One-on-one videotaped mathematics interviews were conducted twice annually for 4 years from Grade 1 to Grade 4 with a varying number of participants from 61 to 45 respectively. Multiplication and quotative division questions were analyzed for correctness, the physical model used to solve the problem, and the computation strategy used to solve the problem. Multiplication and adding up for division models that required the development of more sophisticated unitizing included modelling only one group, modelling just the groups, modelling the groups with the composite numeral, and modelling the new whole. Multiplication and adding up for division strategies that indicated the development of a unitizing structure included rhythmic counting, starting with a doublet, <b>skip</b> <b>counting,</b> regrouping to form a new composite, and splitting the composite and then iterating the sub-composites to find the total. The varying levels of simultaneity demonstrated by students were also noted as they pertain {{to the development of a}} unitizing structure. A theoretical landscape of the development unitizing is proposed...|$|R
50|$|The test {{consists}} of 80 {{questions at the}} elementary and junior high levels (the number is not specified for {{the high school level}} but usually {{consists of}} 70 questions), which the student must complete in only 30 minutes. Judges give no intermediate time signal—at the end of 30 minutes, students must immediately stop calculator processing, but may write one final answer for the problem they're working on at the stop signal. Students must answer questions in order. A <b>skipped</b> question <b>counts</b> as a wrong answer.|$|R
50|$|Free {{accounts}} {{were limited}} to playing up to 1000 songs/mo (up to 12,000/yr) without any special restrictions. A song could be skipped to bypass an undesired track, but <b>skipped</b> songs <b>counted</b> against the monthly allowance. If a free account user exceeds the monthly limit, the user {{would no longer be}} able to listen to LAUNCHcast radio for the remainder of the month, although they could listen to their personal station with no skips. Like skips, songs did not roll over to the next month. This won't be the case when LAUNCHcast is powered by CBS as it will provide unlimited listening.|$|R
40|$|Query {{suggestion}} {{has been}} an effective approach to help users narrow down to the information they need. However, most of existing studies focused on only popular/head queries. Since rare queries possess much less information (e. g., clicks) than popular queries in the query logs, {{it is much more}} difficult to efficiently suggest relevant queries to a rare query. In this paper, we propose an optimal rare query suggestion framework by leveraging implicit feedbacks from users in the query logs. Our model resembles the principle of pseudo-relevance feedback which assumes that top-returned results by search engines are relevant. However, we argue that the clicked URLs and skipped URLs contain different levels of information and thus should be treated differently. Hence, our framework optimally combines both the click and skip information from users and uses a random walk model to optimize the query correlation. Our model specifically optimizes two parameters: (1) the restarting (jumping) rate of random walk, and (2) the combination ratio of click and skip information. Unlike the Rocchio algorithm, our learning process does not involve the content of the URLs but simply leverages the click and <b>skip</b> <b>counts</b> in the query-URL bipartite graphs. Consequently, our model is capable of scaling up to the need of commercial search engines. Experimental results on one-month query logs from a large commercial search engine with over 40 million rare queries demonstrate the superiority of our framework, with statistical significance, over the traditional random walk models and pseudo-relevance feedback models...|$|R
40|$|Children's {{solution}} {{strategies to}} a variety of multiplication and division word problems were analysed at four interview stages in a 2 -year longitudinal study. The study followed 70 children from Year 2 into Year 3, from the time where they had received no formal instruction in multiplication and division to the stage where they were being taught basic multiplication facts. Ten problem structures, five for multiplication and five for division, were classified on the basis ofdifferences in semantic structure. The relationship between problem condition (i [...] e. small or large number combinations and use ofphysical objects or pictures), on performance and strategy use was also examined. The results indicated that 75 % ofthe children were able to solve the problems using a wide variety ofstrategies even though they had not received formal instruction in muitiplication or division for most of the 2 year period. Performance level generally increased for each interview stage, butfew differences were found between multiplication and division problems except for Cartesian and Factor problems. Solution strategies were classifiedfor both multiplication and division problems at three levels: (i) direct modelling with counting; (ii) no direct modelling, with counting, additive or subtractive strategies; (iii) use ofknown or derived facts (addition, multiplication). A wide range of counting strategies were classified as counting-all, <b>skip</b> <b>counting</b> and double counting. Analysis of intuitive models revealed preference for a repeated addition model for multiplication, and a 'building-up 'model for division. In recent years there has been a steady growth in mathematics education research investigating how children develop mathematical concepts an...|$|R
40|$|Wispeco Aluminium’s Profiling {{department}} {{is used for}} the production of the aluminium profiles that Wispeco sells to its’ customers nationwide. The production at this {{department is}} achieved through the usage of five extrusion machines (EP 1 -EP 5) that run continuously throughout a working shift. The continuous running of these machines is what Wispeco would like to maintain as any stoppage of the machines results in financial losses for the company, an estimated loss of R 25248 per hour per machine was highlighted. This figure was calculated using the average production quantity per machine (789 kg/hr.) multiplied by the price per kilogram (R 32 /kg) of aluminium. The only reason that causes the machines to be stopped from running is when {{there is a shortage of}} skips within this department. A skip is a material handling component that needs to be readily available next to the extrusion machines after the production of the aluminium profiles by the machines. The problem for this project was to ensure that there is always an availability of skips next to each extrusion machine and therefore the continuous running of the machines can be maintained, of which a total number of 2720 skips is available within the company and is shared by four departments including the Profiling department. The other three departments are Powder coating, Anodizing and Gauteng Stockists (warehouse). To get a clear understanding of the problem, a time study for a single shift (6 am- 6 pm) was performed with the results thereof used as input data to a simulation model using Simio software. The results of the simulation model gave an indication of the instantaneous production quantities for every machine and hence gave an indication of the number of skips needed per machine per production batch. The remaining number of skips was allocated to the remaining three departments based on the average number of skips needed per department, this number was achieved using the daily <b>skip</b> <b>counts</b> performed at each department.

40|$|The gravure {{industry}} {{does not have}} an inexpensive tester which can accurately predict the behavior of paper on a gravure press. The most acceptable tester currently available is the Parker Print Surf. A 2 ̆ 2 conformity 2 ̆ 2 tester, based on compression of paper into a thin channel, was designed and built. It was compared to the Parker Print Surf and found to be poorer in predicting ability except in the special case of groundwood papers. More study is necessary. Several unusual techniques were used. The first involved running sheets of paper through a web press. This technique had a slight 2 ̆ 2 leading 2 ̆ 2 sample distortion problem. The second involved a new method for designating the <b>skipped</b> dot <b>count</b> of a paper sample.
