5|$|A {{powerful}} way {{of studying}} rings is through their modules. A module {{consists of a}} choice of ring, another set, usually distinct from the underlying <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ring and called the underlying <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> module, an operation on pairs of elements of the underlying <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> module, and an operation which takes {{an element of the}} ring and an element of the module and returns an element of the module. The underlying <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> module and its operation must form a group. A module is a ring-theoretic version of a group representation: Ignoring the second ring operation and the operation on pairs of module elements determines a group representation. The real utility of modules is that the kinds of modules that exist and their interactions, reveal the structure of the ring in ways that are not apparent from the ring itself. An important special case of this is an algebra. (The word algebra means both a subject within mathematics as well as an object studied in the subject of algebra.) An algebra consists of a choice of two rings and an operation which takes an element from each ring and returns an element of the second ring. This operation makes the second ring into a module over the first. Often the first ring is a field.|$|E

Jasmine returns home to see that Khan has filled her house with expensive presents. Her mother is taken aback when Jasmine explains that Khan is a gangster with whom she'd prefer not to associate. Her family questions the sense in rejecting a man as powerful and dangerous as Khan.|$|E

5|$|At {{no point}} during The Wrath of Khan are Khan and Kirk {{in the same}} location; they {{speak to each other}} only over {{communication}} links such as view screens.

Montalbán recited his lines with a script assistant instead of to William Shatner.|$|E

40|$|Currently, mould {{design and}} <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process {{parameters}} <b>of</b> transfer moulding for electronic packages are done manually in a trial-and-error manner. <b>The</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> parameters is largely dependent on <b>the</b> experience <b>of</b> engineers. <b>The</b> paper describes an intelligent process design system for transfer moulding of electronic packages {{that is used}} to determine optimal mould design parameters and <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process parameters mainly based on case-based reasoning, artificial neural networks and a multiobjective optimization scheme. <b>The</b> system consists <b>of</b> two modules: a case-based reasoning module and a process optimization module.
