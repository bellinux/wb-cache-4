40|$|Significant Birds is a 12 channel sound {{installation}} {{created for}} ILLUSION, an {{exhibition at the}} Science Gallery in Dublin, in response to its theme of illusion {{as a means of}} accessing the activity of the human brain. The installation extends Parry’s research techniques into ‘exploratory form’, developed for his ‘Exploded Sound’ project, to create a unique aural illusion that interrogates perceptions of sound. In contrast to the static musical soundworld of the former, Significant Birds focuses on rapidly fluctuating <b>sinewaves</b> which occasionally coalesce into recognisable speech. Each of the 12 speakers is hung in a birdcage around the exhibition space. From each speaker a pure 'chirping' sound can be heard which is in fact a single sine wave extracted from a recording of speech. When all twelve speakers are active and in perfect time with one another the listener hears the speech reconstructed, although no speaker ever contains more than its one single 'partial'. Setting up a sound system of rapidly changing harmonics the installation tests how harmonics are gradually pulled apart in time and intelligibility is lost leaving a virtual 'aviary' of chirping <b>sinewaves.</b> Significant Birds uses real-time analysis of a sound file in Max/MSP allowing the use of a constantly changing (speech) input.

40|$|Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) is {{expected}} to be a technology reshaping the landscape of low-power applications such as the Internet of Things, Radio Frequency identification (RFID) networks, etc. Although there has been some progress towards multi-antenna multi-sine WPT design, the large-scale design of WPT, reminiscent of massive MIMO in communications, remains an open challenge. In this paper, we derive efficient multiuser algorithms based on a generalizable optimization framework, in order to design transmit <b>sinewaves</b> that maximize the weighted-sum/minimum rectenna output DC voltage. The study highlights the significant effect of the nonlinearity introduced by the rectification process on the design of waveforms in multiuser systems. Interestingly, in the single-user case, the optimal spatial domain beamforming, obtained prior to the frequency domain power allocation optimization, turns out to be Maximum Ratio Transmission (MRT). In contrast, in the general weighted sum criterion maximization problem, the spatial domain beamforming optimization and the frequency domain power allocation optimization are coupled. Assuming channel hardening, low-complexity algorithms are proposed based on asymptotic analysis, to maximize the two criteria. The structure of the asymptotically optimal spatial domain precoder can be found prior to the optimization. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated. Numerical results confirm the inefficiency of the linear model-based design for the single and multi-user scenarios. It is also shown that as nonlinear model-based designs, the proposed algorithms can benefit from an increasing number of <b>sinewaves.</b> Comment: Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Signal Processin...|$|R
