25|$|In 1820 Kilmaurs Parish {{had only}} four freeholders {{qualified}} {{to vote and}} Dreghorn had only five, these being the proprietors of Cunninghamhead, Annock Lodge, Langlands (2) and Warwickhill. On Saturday, 3 March 1827 a remarkable <b>snow-storm</b> hit Ayrshire. The snow lay up to twenty feet deep in places and it snowed for twenty-four hours. A strong wind got up and drifts covered even {{the tops of the}} hedges so the roads were all but hidden.|$|E
25|$|I {{afterwards}} travelled {{much with}} him, and have now only {{to speak of}} him with great respect, or, I ought to say, with admiration... No living person possesses a tithe of his information respecting the Hudson's Bay countries... Never mind his Bunyan-like face and cropped hair; {{he has a very}} powerful mind, and a singular faculty of picture-making. He can create a wilderness and people it with warring savages, or climb the Rocky Mountains with you in a <b>snow-storm,</b> so clearly and palpably, that only shut your eyes and you hear the crack of the rifle, or feel the snow-flakes melt on your cheeks as he talks.|$|E
2500|$|The poem was {{inspired}} by Wordsworth being surrounded by snow, and his sister's memory of a real incident that happened at Halifax. Wordsworth explained the origins when he wrote, [...] "Written at Goslar in Germany in 1799. It was founded on a circumstance told me by my Sister, {{of a little girl}} who, not far from Halifax in Yorkshire, was bewildered in a <b>snow-storm.</b> Her footsteps were traced by her parents {{to the middle of the}} lock of a canal, and no other vestige of her, backward or forward, could be traced. The body however was found in the canal." [...] Lucy Gray was first published in Volume 2 of the 1800 edition of Lyrical Ballads.|$|E

60|$|Another curious {{thing about}} these stage <b>snow-storms</b> {{is that the}} moon is always shining brightly through the whole of them. And it shines only on the heroine, and it follows her about just like the snow does.|$|R
60|$|Of {{course you}} can't {{get away from}} a <b>snow-storm</b> like that! A stage <b>snow-storm</b> {{is the kind of}} <b>snow-storm</b> that would follow you upstairs and want to come into bed with you.|$|E
60|$|Morning came, but {{the cabin}} {{was almost as}} dark as by night. A blinding, {{swirling}} <b>snow-storm</b> obscured the sun.|$|E
60|$|Half an {{hour after}} we {{embarked}} a <b>snow-storm</b> came on, but still we pulled along, preferring anything to resuming the snow-shoes.|$|E
60|$|Eliz. Silence! I'll go. Better in God's hand than man's. He shall kill us, if we die. This bitter blast Warping the {{leafless}} willows, yon white <b>snow-storms,</b> Whose wings, like vengeful angels, cope the vault, They are God's,--We'll {{trust to}} them.|$|R
50|$|Winters are {{prolonged}} and {{are characterized}} by steady frosty weather and high northerly winds. During this period the temperatures usually stay well below freezing for months. In February and March there are frequent <b>snow-storms</b> with wind speeds of 140 km/h or above.|$|R
60|$|For {{many years}} I was self-appointed {{inspector}} of <b>snow-storms</b> and rain-storms, and did my duty faithfully; surveyor, if not of highways, then of forest paths and all across-lot routes, keeping them open, and ravines bridged and passable at all seasons, where the public heel had testified to their utility.|$|R
60|$|We {{have even}} known {{a more than}} unusually {{malignant}} <b>snow-storm</b> to follow a heroine three times round the stage and then go off (R.) with her.|$|E
60|$|The stage heroine's only {{pleasure}} {{in life is}} to go out in a <b>snow-storm</b> without an umbrella and with no bonnet on. She has a bonnet, we know (rather a tasteful little thing); we have seen it hanging up behind the door of her room; but when she comes out for a night stroll during a heavy <b>snow-storm</b> (accompanied by thunder), she is most careful to leave it at home. Maybe she fears the snow will spoil it, and she is a careful girl.|$|E
6000|$|... "What are {{we going}} to do?" [...] said he. [...] "If we get lost in this <b>snow-storm,</b> we shall have to stay in the woods perhaps all night." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, dear, {{more like}} this than {{anything}} else you have ever seen; but the sun does not always shine so brightly as it does just now, and sometimes there are terrible <b>snow-storms.</b> But we will build you a nice house, Eda, with a very large fireplace, so that we won't feel the cold." ...|$|R
60|$|So Nursey {{told her}} best tales; and {{when at last}} the child lay down under her lace curtains, her head was full of a curious jumble of Christmas elves, poor children, <b>snow-storms,</b> sugarplums, and surprises. So {{it is no wonder}} that she dreamed all night; and this was the dream, which she never quite forgot.|$|R

6000|$|... "'In <b>snow-storms</b> it was awful, {{and more}} than one of my mates dropped dead with {{overwork}} and discouragement. I used to wish I could do the same, for my poor feet, badly shod, became so lame I could hardly walk at times, and the constant strain on the up grades brought back the old trouble in my shoulder worse than ever.|$|R
60|$|The mill-windows were alight, {{the bell}} still rung loud, {{and now the}} little {{children}} came running in, in too great a hurry, let us hope, to feel very much nipped by the inclement air; and indeed, by contrast, perhaps the morning appeared rather favourable to them than otherwise, for they had often come to their work that winter through <b>snow-storms,</b> through heavy rain, through hard frost.|$|R

60|$|One {{of the few}} <b>snow-storms</b> of the memorably mild {{winter of}} 1876 was coming quietly down, watched with lazy {{interest}} by the passengers in a certain train that rumbled leisurely toward the city. Without {{it was cold and}} wintry enough, but within as hot as an oven; for, with the usual American disregard of health, there was a roaring fire in the stove, every ventilator shut, and only one man in the crowded car had his window open.|$|R
60|$|Daddy never {{finished}} a story. If {{he started in}} to tell about a horse-trade, it infallibly {{reminded him of a}} cattle trade, and talking of cattle switched him off upon logging, and logging reminded him of some heavy <b>snow-storms</b> he had known. Each parenthesis outgrew its proper limits, till he forgot what should have been the main story. His stories had some compensation, for when he stopped to try to recollect where he was, the pressure on the grindstone was released.|$|R
40|$|Stable isotope {{studies of}} snow cover along several itineraries through Spitsbergen {{were carried out}} (from Gronfjorden coast till ice divide of Gronfjord â€“ Fridtjov glacier and from Barentsburg {{settlement}} till Olav mountain). Results obtained were compared with ones fixed for snow on Severnaya Zemlya archipelago. Uncertainty of condensation processes were shown for precipitation falling on Arctic polar ice domes (sometimes we fixed altitudinal isotope gradient and in other cases the gradient was absent). In periglacial zone of arctic islands isotope values are scattered randomly, covering the entire annual precipitation range due to strong <b>snow-storms.</b> </p...|$|R
