[...] Senior Vice President Joel Stillerman ascribed that much of its success came from the storytelling presented in the episode; [...] "The Walking Dead is that rare piece of programming that works on so many levels.

Speaking {{of the first two}} episodes, Mark Hughes of Forbes added additional praise, saying, [...] "Quite simply, in Daredevil Marvel delivers one of the greatest live-action superhero origin stories ever made. It is in the same top-tier category of true superhero origin films along with Batman Begins, Iron Man, and [...]" [...] Hughes stated that if the first two episodes were released in theaters with only minor tweaks, they [...] "would’ve been hailed as one of Marvel’s best films to date." [...] Mike Hale at the New York Times was less positive about the series, calling it ordinary, but admitting having high expectations due to his love for the comics, and admiring the care and seriousness with which the series was made. He called the series pace [...] "leisurely", but [...] "a pleasant change from the norm", and called Cox's performance [...] "divided", praising him as Murdock and criticizing him as Daredevil. Hale was positive about the cast overall, and ultimately surmised that after seeing the first five episodes, Daredevil is [...] "eminently watchable", but not the Daredevil he remembered from the comics.|$|E

40|$|We {{continue}} {{the study of}} model-independent constraints on the unitary Conformal Field Theories in 4 -Dimensions, initiated in arXiv: 0807. 0004. Our main result is an improved upper bound on the dimension ∆ of the leading scalar operator appearing in the OPE of two identical scalars of dimension d: φd × φd = 1 + O ∆ + [...] . In the interval 1 < d < 1. 7 this universal bound takes the form ∆ ≤ 2 + 0. 7 (d − 1) 1 / 2 + 2. 1 (d − 1) + 0. 43 (d − 1) 3 / 2. The proof is based on prime principles of CFT: unitarity, crossing symmetry, OPE, and conformal block decomposition. We also discuss possible applications to particle phenomenology and, via a 2 -D analogue, to string theory. 1 Introduction and formulation of the problem Our knowledge about non-supersymmetric Conformal Field Theories (CFTs) in four dimensions (4 D) is still quite incomplete. <b>Suffices</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that not a single nontrivial example is known which would be solvable {{to the same extent}} as, say, the 2 D Ising model.
