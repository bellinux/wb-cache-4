60|$|She {{pushed the}} tangled {{hair from her}} forehead, {{mechanically}} readjusting her cumbersome garments, then she stepped close up to the young Spaniard; <b>she</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> over her breast and looked him boldly in the eyes.|$|E
60|$|She {{determined}} {{to go and see}} Mary Erskine after dinner, again, as the visit would at least be a token of kindness and sympathy, even if it should do no other good. She arrived at the house about the middle of the afternoon. She found Mary Erskine busily at work, putting the house in order, and rectifying the many derangements which sickness and death always occasion. Mary Erskine received Mrs. Bell at first with a cheerful smile, and seemed, to all appearance, as contented and happy as usual. The sight of Mrs. Bell, however, recalled forcibly to her mind her irremediable loss, and overwhelmed her heart, again, with bitter grief. She went to the window, where her little work-table had been placed, and throwing herself down in a chair before it, <b>she</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> upon the table, laid her forehead down upon them in an attitude of despair, and burst into tears.|$|E
6000|$|LADY (letting {{her hands}} fall [...] ). Tear them from me--by force! (As he glares {{at her like}} a tiger about to spring, <b>she</b> <b>crosses</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> on <b>her</b> breast in the {{attitude}} of a martyr. The gesture and pose instantly awaken his theatrical instinct: he forgets his rage in the desire to show her that in acting, too, she has met her match. He keeps her a moment in suspense; then suddenly clears up his countenance; puts his hands behind him with provoking coolness; looks at her {{up and down a}} couple of times; takes a pinch of snuff; wipes his fingers carefully and puts up his handkerchief, her heroic pose becoming more and more ridiculous all the time.) ...|$|R
6000|$|There was Miss Nan, to be sure, tugging along a {{very large}} band-box tied up in linen bag. Very hot and dusty and tired did she look, but marched stoutly along, and came puffing up to the steps, where she dropped her load {{with a sigh of}} relief, and sat down upon it, {{observed}} as <b>she</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> tired <b>arms,</b> ...|$|R
60|$|Beatrice did {{not quite}} see it all; but she saw enough of it to know that Mary was to be pitied; so, instead of scolding her friend for being <b>cross,</b> <b>she</b> threw <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> round <b>her</b> and kissed her affectionately.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of the {{painting}} "Blossoms" by Morre, depicting a woman draped in cloth, [s. d. ]. The woman stands in full figure at center, wrapped in a lightly-colored sheet. <b>She</b> <b>crosses</b> both of <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> across <b>her</b> chest, holding the hands behind her right ear. Her flaxen hair seems to be bound back with a darkly-colored bonnet of some kind. She is barefoot. A wall of flowers can be seen behind her...|$|R
60|$|Mrs Gaff {{promptly}} {{locked the}} door {{with an air of}} thorough determination, put the key in <b>her</b> bosom, and <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> thereon tightly.|$|R
60|$|Belle stood quite still till he had finished. She {{had assumed}} her {{favourite}} attitude and <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> behind <b>her</b> back, and her sweet childish face was calm and very white.|$|R
60|$|Miggs, hearing this, let her {{end of the}} box fall {{heavily to}} the floor, gave a very loud sniff, <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> screwed down {{the corners of her}} mouth, and cried, in an {{ascending}} scale, 'Ho, good gracious!' three distinct times.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> {{hands in}} front of her and bowed her head solemnly, without uttering a word, and without taking her eyes off mine for a moment.|$|R
6000|$|To {{my great}} dismay, the {{housekeeper}} took even a more gloomy view than Morgan of the approaching event. When I had explained all the circumstances to her, she carefully put down <b>her</b> basket, <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> {{and said to}} me in slow, deliberate, mysterious tones: ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{last the}} girl raised herself; {{now that the}} pallid, masklike despair of the last month was broken, she seemed on fire, and her face had a wild look. She withdrew herself from Leila's touch, and, <b>crossing</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> tightly across <b>her</b> chest, said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What then? Is it {{something}} {{you may not}} tell me?" [...] asked the woman in a wheedling tone, as <b>she</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> legs and toyed with the flap of her tail.|$|R
60|$|Petite maman {{smoothed}} out <b>her</b> apron, <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> before <b>her,</b> and looked the sergeant quite {{straight in the}} face. Rosette's eyes were full of tears, but she {{showed no signs of}} fear either, although her shoulder--where one of the gendarmes had seized it so roughly--was terribly painful.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, if I am a {{trouble to}} you, be it so. Be {{it as you}} wish," [...] and she {{leaned back against the}} wall of the rock, and <b>crossing</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> upon <b>her</b> breast looked away from him and fixed her eyes upon the sharp granite peaks of Canigou.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{the blonde}} {{character}} from I Dream of Jeannie (portrayed by Barbara Eden), the animated Jeannie was a ponytailed redhead. Jeannie could use her magical powers by <b>crossing</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> and whipping <b>her</b> ponytail instead of blinking her eyes. On September 22, 1973, Jeannie and Babu made one guest appearance on The New Scooby-Doo Movies. Four years later, Babu alone appeared on Laff-A-Lympics.|$|R
5000|$|In {{countries}} {{other than}} Scotland the hands are often crossed {{from the beginning}} of the song at variance with Scottish custom. The Scottish practice was demonstrated by the Queen at the Millennium Dome celebrations for the year 2000. The English press berated her for not [...] "properly" [...] <b>crossing</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> unaware that <b>she</b> was correctly following the Scottish tradition.|$|R
6000|$|She {{said it in}} a quick {{involuntary}} way, {{but half}} playfully, and not more petulantly or disagreeably than a favourite child might have done, who laughed next moment. Tattycoram set her full red lips together, and <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> upon <b>her</b> bosom. 'Did you wish to know, sir,' she said, looking at Mr Meagles, 'what Miss Wade wrote to me about?' ...|$|R
60|$|Giving him a {{friendly}} shake of the hand, Mrs. Bagnet draws {{a long breath}} after her walk and sits down to enjoy a rest. Having a faculty, matured {{on the tops of}} baggage-waggons and in other such positions, of resting easily anywhere, she perches on a rough bench, unties her bonnet-strings, pushes back <b>her</b> bonnet, <b>crosses</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> and looks perfectly comfortable.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{only the}} doctor," [...] said Mrs. Rook. <b>She</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> {{hands over her}} bosom with a {{deep-drawn}} sigh. [...] "I want no doctor, now. My peace is made with my Maker. I'm ready for death; I'm fit for Heaven. Go away! go away!" ...|$|R
6000|$|A lady, {{behind the}} Times, smiled; her mouth--indeed, her whole hard, {{handsome}} face--was reminiscent of dappled rocking-horses {{found in the}} Soho Bazaar. <b>She</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> feet, and some rich and silk stuff rustled. Her whole personality seemed to creak as, without looking, she answered in harsh tones: ...|$|R
6000|$|MAUD. [Struggling to {{withdraw}} {{her hand and}} finally succeeding. Her voice is rather faint.] Ye-es, er [...] . Bob [...] . er [...] . {{glad to see you}} again. [She looks ruefully at her bruised fingers and sinks into chair. Then, recollecting <b>her</b> part, <b>she</b> <b>crosses</b> <b>her</b> legs in a mannish way.] ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> hands resignedly. [...] "You {{know all}} by this time," [...] she answered. [...] "Sebastian would tell you, of course, {{when you went}} to {{announce}} that you were leaving Nathaniel's. He could not do otherwise; it is the outcome of his temperament--an integral part of his nature." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And you live, as I understand, over at {{the pretty}} little cottage. It is very {{nice of you to}} call so early. I don't suppose that we shall get on, but still the {{intention}} is equally good." [...] <b>She</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> legs and leaned her back against the marble mantelpiece.|$|R
60|$|There was a {{momentary}} flush on her firm square face, {{a momentary}} stillness in her restless hands, {{which seemed to}} betoken a coming outburst of anger that might throw her off her guard. But no--she mastered the rising irritation, leaned back in <b>her</b> chair, <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> on <b>her</b> broad bosom, and with a smile of grim sarcasm on her thick lips, {{looked at me as}} steadily as ever.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{even smaller}} panels each depict a female figure with a halo on a plain golden background, with {{cypresses}} {{on either side}} of them, symbolising the Garden of Eden. According to their inscriptions they represent the Virtues of [...] "η αλιθηα" [...] (ἡ ἀλήθεια, Sincerity) and [...] "η ταινοσις" [...] (ἡ ταπείνωσις, Humility). Sincerity holds a cross in one hand and points to her mouth, while Humility <b>crosses</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> over <b>her</b> chest.|$|R
60|$|She {{went down}} the long gallery, whose walls glowed with the new frescoes from the wonder-working brush of Andrea Mantegna; <b>she</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> ante-chamber and gained the very room where some hours ago she had {{received}} the insult of Gian Maria's odious advances. She passed through the now empty room, and stepped out on to the terrace that overlooked the paradise-like gardens of the Palace.|$|R
5000|$|Karen Olivo as Cassie Reynolds (season 2): A lawyer Harry hires {{soon after}} {{expanding}} the law firm. It was revealed in [...] "Insanity" [...] that when Cassie {{was in high}} school, a man opened fire on campus and killed her best friend. She formerly worked in the DA's office with Roseanna Remmick. Highly strung and prone to <b>crossing</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> when <b>she's</b> in an argument, she is still {{shown to be a}} gifted lawyer. Often employed by Harry to [...] "flash some leg" [...] at people causing her difficulties.|$|R
6000|$|She {{laid her}} cigar aside like Amelius, and <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> over <b>her</b> bosom, {{and looked at}} him, with the first {{softening}} gleam of tenderness {{that he had seen}} in her face. [...] "My friend," [...] she said, [...] "yours will be a sad life--I pity you. The world will wound that sensitive heart of yours; the world will trample on that generous nature. One of these days, perhaps, you will be a wretch like me. No more of that. Get up; I have something to show you." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>crossed</b> to <b>her</b> uncle's {{desk and}} looked downward. The carpet had {{apparently}} not been disturbed. There {{were no signs}} {{that it had been}} touched at all.|$|R
60|$|In {{due course}} {{one of the}} more dashing of the young men remarked that if they wanted to dance they'd better begin. The girl who had played the accompaniments sat at the piano and placed a decided foot on the loud pedal. She played a dreamy waltz, marking the time with the bass, while with the right hand she 'tiddled' in {{alternate}} octaves. By way of a change <b>she</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> hands and played the air in the bass.|$|R
60|$|No singer after a first concert {{has felt}} more triumphant than Claire when <b>she</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> first state-line; rumbled {{over the bridge}} across the Red River into North Dakota. To see Dakota car {{licenses}} everywhere, instead of Minnesota, was like the sensation of street signs in a new language. And when she found a good hotel in Fargo and had a real bath, she felt that by her own efforts she had {{earned the right to}} enjoy it.|$|R
6000|$|He seemed however to be uneasy and restless, and he moaned now {{and then}} as if in pain. Mary Erskine stood leaning over him for some time, with a countenance filled with anxiety and concern. She then turned away, saying to herself, [...] "If Albert {{is going to be}} sick and to die, what will become of me?" [...] She kneeled down upon the floor {{at the foot of the}} bed, <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> before <b>her,</b> laid them down very quietly upon the counterpane, and {{reclined}} her forehead upon them. She remained in that position for some time without speaking a word.|$|R
50|$|He {{became the}} {{retained}} jockey for Sir Joseph Hawley {{and was therefore}} most often found riding for that owner's trainer, George Manning, who was based at Cannons Heath, near Kingsclere, Berkshire. Early on in his professional career, he suffered a serious accident while riding the mare Freedom in the Earl Spencer's Plate at Northampton in April 1852. As two horses closed on <b>her</b> to overtake, <b>she</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> legs and fell, breaking her back and dying instantly. Wells himself was left with severe concussion.|$|R
60|$|It did offend her; I {{thought it}} would. But she looked really {{interesting}} when <b>she</b> was <b>cross.</b> <b>Her</b> grey eyes would flash, and {{her whole body}} quiver. There was a charming spice of danger always about making <b>her</b> <b>cross.</b>|$|R
60|$|There <b>she</b> paused, and <b>crossed</b> <b>her</b> {{hands on}} her lap, and waited for {{what was to come}} next.|$|R
