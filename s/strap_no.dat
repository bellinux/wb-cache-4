60|$|On the 3rd of June, 1890, a gentleman, {{who gave}} {{his name as}} Monsieur Louis Caratal, desired an {{interview}} with Mr. James Bland, the superintendent of the London and West Coast Central Station in Liverpool. He was a small man, middle-aged and dark, with a stoop which was so marked that it suggested some deformity of the spine. He {{was accompanied by a}} friend, a man of imposing physique, whose deferential manner and constant attention showed that his position was one of dependence. This friend or companion, whose name did not transpire, was certainly a foreigner, and probably from his swarthy complexion, either a Spaniard or a South American. One peculiarity was observed in him. He carried in his left hand a small black, leather dispatch box, and it was noticed by a sharp-eyed clerk in the Central office that this box was fastened to his wrist by a <b>strap.</b> <b>No</b> importance was attached to the fact at the time, but subsequent events endowed it with some significance. Monsieur Caratal was shown up to Mr. Bland's office, while his companion remained outside.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This study {{aimed to}} {{quantify}} bra shoulder strap pressures, to investigate how bra strap cushions moderated this pressure and increased comfort, and {{to investigate the}} effects of variations in bra shoulder strap configuration on vertical breast motion, breast discomfort, shoulder pressures, and comfort. Methods: Fourteen healthy women (C+ bra cup size) ran on a treadmill wearing a sports bra under five <b>strap</b> conditions (<b>no</b> <b>straps,</b> traditional vertical alignment, crossed-back alignment, and with and without bra strap cushions inserted under the straps). Bra shoulder strap pressure, vertical breast displacement, breast pain, and shoulder comfort were measured during each trial. Results: Maximal pressures from 0. 83 to 2. 67 N·cm- 2 and mean pressures from 0. 52 to 1. 06 N·cm- 2 were recorded during running. The bra strap cushions only reduced maximal shoulder strap pressure in the crossed-back strap orientation. Vertical breast displacement was significantly less in the crossed-back orientation compared with <b>no</b> <b>straps,</b> and breast pain was significantly reduced in both the traditional and crossed-back orientation compared with the <b>no</b> <b>strap</b> condition. <b>No</b> significant between-condition difference was found in shoulder comfort regardless of shoulder strap orientation, although the crossed-back strap orientation resulted in significant increases in shoulder force and mean pressure values compared with the traditional strap orientation. Conclusion: The bra shoulder strap cushion was not effective in decreasing the bra shoulder strap pressure due to design flaws that prevented it from adequately increasing the strap–shoulder contact area. However, modifying shoulder strap orientation from a traditional to a crossed-back configuration could alleviate the common problem of bra shoulder straps slipping off {{the shoulders of the}} wearer, without decreasing the overall efficacy of the sports bra in providing breast support...|$|R

40|$|Twenty four uninjured female volunteers (mean age = 19. 6 years) were {{utilised}} {{to study}} the effect of modified Gibney ankle strapping on proprioception before, during and after exercise, by measuring performance on an instrumented wobbleboard. Following a familiarisation session, testing was conducted on two occasions using a crossover research design, utilising strapped and unstrapped conditions. The time in contact, the number of contacts and the average time in contact that the wobbleboard made with a metal baseplate under the wobbleboard were recorded during a ten second test duration. Tests were conducted at the times of 0, 5, 10 and 15 minutes of a standardised exercise regime performed by the subjects. Results revealed that <b>strapping</b> had <b>no</b> significant effect on wobbleboard performance. Since the wobbleboard is widely accepted {{as a method of}} training as well as a clinical assessment of ankle proprioception, it could be inferred that <b>strapping</b> had <b>no</b> effect on proprioception before, during or after exercise...|$|R

2500|$|Spermatogenesis {{takes place}} within several {{structures}} of the male reproductive system. The initial stages occur within the testes and progress to the epididymis where the developing gametes mature and are stored until ejaculation.

50|$|The {{original}} Galand revolver was a double-action, {{open frame}} (<b>no</b> <b>strap</b> {{across the top}} of the cylinder) revolver patented in 1868. Military versions were produced in 9 mm while civilian versions were made in 12 mm. The gun is easily recognizable due to its long extraction lever, which stretches under the gun to form the trigger guard. Pulling the lever forward separates the barrel and cylinder from the rest of the gun. At the same time the extractor plate is blocked which catches any cartridges in the cylinder, thereby extracting them.|$|R
5000|$|The unfluted {{cylinder}} was [...] "rebated", {{meaning that}} {{the rear of the}} cylinder was turned to a smaller diameter than the front. The barrel was rounded and smoothed into the frame, as was the Navy Model. The frame, hammer, and rammer lever were case-hardened, the remainder blued; grips were of one-piece walnut; and the trigger guard and front grip strap were of brass while the backstrap was blued."A distinguishing feature of the Model 1860 was that its frame had <b>no</b> top <b>strap,</b> or <b>no</b> component running above the cylinder. Instead, its strength came from the lower frame and the massive fixed cylinder pin. This made the gun slimmer and lighter than its main competitor, the Remington Model 1858, but with a possible loss of strength. The fixed cylinder pin also meant that the barrel had to be removed to remove the cylinder, unlike the Model 1858, which only required removal of the cylinder retaining pin.|$|R

25|$|A {{buddy line}} is a line or strap {{physically}} tethering two scuba divers together underwater to avoid separation in low visibility conditions. A buddy line is usually a short length of about 2 meters with a floating element between the divers {{to reduce the risk}} of snagging on the bottom. A buddy {{line is a}} means of communication and does not need to be very strong or secure, but should not pull off under moderate loads while in use. The divers may communicate by rope signals, but will more usually just use the line to attract attention before moving closer and communicating by hand signals. The disadvantage of a buddy line is an increased risk of snagging and entanglement. The divers may need to disconnect the line quickly at either end in an emergency which may be done by using a quick release mechanism or by cutting the line, both of which require at least one hand to be free. A velcro <b>strap</b> requires <b>no</b> tools for release and can be released under tension.|$|R
