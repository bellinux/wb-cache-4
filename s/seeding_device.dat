40|$|There is a {{clinical}} {{need for a}} tissue-engineered vascular graft (TEVG), and combining stem cells with biodegradable tubular scaffolds {{appears to be a}} promising approach. The goal {{of this study was to}} characterize the incorporation of muscle-derived stem cells (MDSCs) within tubular poly(ester urethane) urea (PEUU) scaffolds in vitro to understand their interaction, and to evaluate the mechanical properties of the constructs for vascular applications. Porous PEUU scaffolds were seeded with MDSCs using our recently described rotational vacuum <b>seeding</b> <b>device,</b> and cultured inside a spinner flask for 3 or 7 days. Cell viability, number, distribution and phenotype were assessed along with the suture retention strength and uniaxial mechanical behavior of the TEVGs. The <b>seeding</b> <b>device</b> allowed rapid even distribution of cells within the scaffolds. After 3 days, the constructs appeared completely populated with cells that were spread within the polymer. Cells underwent a population doubling of 2. 1 -fold, with a population doubling time of 35 h. Stem cell antigen- 1 (Sca- 1) expression by the cells remained high after 7 days in culture (77 ± 20 % vs. 66 ± 6 % at day 0) while CD 34 expression was reduced (19 ± 12 % vs. 61 ± 10 % at day 0) and myosin heavy chain expression was scarce (not quantified). The estimated burst strength of the TEVG constructs was 2127 ± 900 mmHg and suture retention strength was 1. 3 ± 0. 3 N. We conclude from this study that MDSCs can be rapidly seeded within porous biodegradable tubular scaffolds while maintaining cell viability and high proliferation rates and without losing stem cell phenotype for up to 7 days of in-vitro culture. The successful integration of these steps is thought necessary to provide rapid availability of TEVGs, which is essential for clinical translation. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|The {{success of}} small-diameter tissue {{engineered}} vascular grafts (TEVGs) greatly relies on an appropriate cell source and an efficient cellular delivery and carrier system.

The objective {{of this study was}} to incorporate pericytes into a biodegradable scaffold rapidly, densely and efficiently, and to assess the efficacy of the pericyte-seeded scaffold in vivo. Bi-layered elastomeric poly(ester-urethane) urea scaffolds (length = 10 mm; inner diameter = 1. 3 mm) were bulk seeded with 3 × 10 6 pericytes using a customized rotational vacuum <b>seeding</b> <b>device</b> in less than 2 min (seeding efficiency > 90 %). The seeded scaffolds were cultured in spinner flasks for 2 days and then implanted into Lewis rats as aortic interposition grafts for 8 weeks.

After implantation, pericyte-seeded TEVGs showed a significant higher patency rate than the unseeded control: 100 % versus 38 % (p < 0. 05). Patent pericyte-seeded TEVGs revealed extensive tissue remodeling with collagen and elastin present.

40|$|Limited {{autologous}} {{vascular graft}} availability and poor patency rates of synthetic grafts for small-diameter revascularization (e. g., coronary artery bypass, peripheral bypass, arteriovenous graft for hemodyalisis access, etc.) remain a {{concern in the}} surgical community. A tissue engineering vascular graft (TEVG), including suitable cell source, scaffold, seeding, and culture methods can potentially solve these limitations. Muscle-derived stem cells (MDSCs) are multipotent cells, with long-term proliferation and self-renewal capabilities, which represent a valid candidate for vascular tissue engineering applications due to their plasticity/heterogeneity. The poly(ester urethane) urea (PEUU) is also an attractive potential candidate {{for use as a}} TEVG due to its elasticity and tunable mechanical and degradation properties. We hypothesized that a novel scaffold optimally seeded with stem cells, acutely cultured and stimulated in vitro, and ultimately implanted in vivo will remodel into a functional vascular tissue. To test this hypothesis, we developed an innovative, multidisciplinary framework to fabricate and culture a TEVG in a timeframe compatible with clinical practice. In this approach, MDSCs were incorporated into a newly-designed and characterized PEUU-based scaffold via a novel <b>seeding</b> <b>device,</b> which was tested quantitatively for cell seeding uniformity and viability. The seeded TEVGs were acutely cultured in dynamic conditions and assessed for cell phenotype, proliferation, and spreading. The conduits were then implanted systemically in a small and a large animal model and assessed, at different time points, for patency rate, remodeling, and cellular engraftment and phenotype. The seeding technology demonstrated a rapid, efficient, reproducible, and quantitatively uniform seeding without affecting cell viability. The PEUU scaffold that was developed is suitable for arterial applications, exhibiting appropriate strength, compliance, and suture retention properties. The dynamic culture resulted in cell proliferation and spreading within the 3 D scaffold environment. Rat preclinical studies suggested a role of the seeded MDSCs in the maintenance of patency and in the remodeling of the TEVG toward a native-like structure. Pig studies were inconclusive due to a poor pre-implantation cell density. Future work should address this and other issues encountered during the large animal study, and should test longer time points in both models.

40|$|Abstract. Seed-filling {{device of}} plot seeder is the {{research}} object. Influences {{of the four}} test factors (motion velocity (v), rotation speed of filling device (ω), generatrix length of seed-filling device (l), base angle of seed-filling device (α)) on the uniformity in seeding-filling process for wheat seed are analyzed by DPS 7. 05. The effect order of four test factors on wheat seed is obtained. Optimum parameters for wheat seed established are as follows: motion velocity of plot seeder 0. 4 m/s, rotation speed of seed-filling device 0. 25 rad/s, generatrix length of seed-filling device 0. 1 m, base angle of seed-filling device 50 º. The best plot length for the seed-filling device is 10 m and the best CV in seed-filling process for wheat seed is 7. 85 % when seeding rate for wheat seed are 180 g per plot. Working Process of Seed-Filling Device Main structure of plot seeder is as shown in Fig. 1. The operator places seed on the desk for supplying <b>seed</b> into storage <b>device</b> 3. With the vibration of plot seeder at work, <b>seed</b> in storage <b>device</b> by vibration gradually levels. Storage device 1 is lifted, and <b>seed</b> in storage <b>device</b> slides on conical surface of seed-filling device into every grids of grid plate when seed began to sow in the plot.

40|$|Abstract. Wheat {{precision}} seeding test {{system is designed}} to develop a measurement device of wheat {{precision seeding}} with high efficiency and precision. The wheat seeds are falling from the <b>seed</b> sowing <b>device</b> to the conveyer belt. Using image processing techniques, the system gets the pictures of seeds on the belt. Then these pictures are processed and analyzed to calculate the qualified rate, reseeding rate and leakage sowing rate, etc. This paper introduces the whole structure, design parameters of the system, the hardware and software of the image acquisition system. Through selection of a proper threshold, the method of seed identification and seed-space measurement are given in this paper...|$|R
