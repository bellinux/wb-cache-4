5000|$|PCIBank has {{a diverse}} and unique history. It was {{established}} on February 1960 as the Philippine Commercial Industrial Bank, with its Head Office in Dasmarinas Street, Binondo Manila. In 1966 it moved its head {{office to the}} corner of T.M. Kalaw and A. Mabini Streets (building now demolished). In 1976, it merged with the Philippine Bank of Commerce and Merchants Banking Corporation, creating then the largest branch network. The 1980s was a very significant decade in the bank; in 1982 it officially decided to adopt the history of the Philippine Bank of Commerce, resulting it to get the distinction of being the first Filipino-owned private commercial bank in the country, and it established its ExpressPadala Center in Ermita and it pioneered the remittance business in the country. Then in 1983, it decided to change the [...] "I" [...] in PCIBank from Industrial to International, to reflect the wide foreign office network of the bank. In 1985, it merged with the Insular Bank of Asia and America. In 1987, John Gokongwei bought shares in the bank, becoming the second largest stockholder he appointed Rafael Buenaventura to head PCIBank as President and CEO. Adding sparkle to PCI Bank’s history are the string of the [...] "Bank of the Year" [...] awards from the editors of Euromoney and Asiamoney. The Bank has also been cited for its export financing, <b>specialized</b> <b>lending</b> and consumer finance activities by the Philippine Export and Foreign Loan Guarantee Corporation, the Development Bank of the Philippines, and the Home Insurance and Guaranty Corporation. Addressing the various needs of its customers, PCI Bank set up subsidiaries to provide services ranging from leasing, investment banking and stock market transactions to credit cards, consumer loans, insurance, and overseas remittances. Also in the 1980s proved hard for the Lopezes because all of their businesses were seized by President Marcos. To this day The Romualdez-Lopez Dispute case still remains at court. Also in the 1980s when Gokongwei entered PCIBank he also owned Far East Bank and Trust Co and talks of a merger surfaced which would have created the largest bank in the Philippines. In 1991, PCIBank formed BancNet along with Security Bank, Chinabank, RCBC, Allied Bank (merged with PNB), Metrobank, International Corporate Bank (now part of UnionBank) and Citytrust Savings Bank. BancNet was also the brainchild of one of PCIBank's senior officers Mr. Ramon Arceo, Jr., the Senior Vice President. The PCIBank Group also had 3 companies/subsidiaries listed at the Philippine Stock Exchange namely the mother bank itself (PSE:PCI), Bankard; Now an affiliate of RCBC (PSE:BKD) and PCI Leasing and Finance (PSE:PCIL) now named BDO Leasing and Finance (PSE:BLFI).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{implications}} of cross-border financial integration for financial stability when banks' loan portfolios adjust endogenously. Banks can be subject to sectoral and aggregate domestic shocks. After integration they can share these risks in a complete interbank market. When banks have a comparative advantage in providing credit to certain industries, financial integration may induce banks to <b>specialize</b> in <b>lending.</b> An enhanced concentration in lending does not necessarily increase risk, because a well-functioning interbank market allows to achieve the necessary diversification. This greater need for risk sharing, though, {{increases the risk of}} cross-border contagion and the likelihood of widespread banking crises.

40|$|From the {{beginning}} of IMF lending in 1947, the staff understood that countries could have difficulty financing their balance of payments for two reasons: either because their economic policies were inadequate or because of circumstances beyond their control. With experience, though, the Fund realized a basic lesson. Even if {{the root cause of}} the problem was an external shock, such as a weak market for the country’s exports, policies would have to be adjusted to compensate unless the shock was temporary and the gap could be covered by a repayable loan. Because few shocks could be judged reliably to be “temporary, ” the Fund increasingly conditioned its lending on policy adjustments. This confidence in and reliance on conditionality reached its zenith in the 1990 s. Of course, to paraphrase Leo Tolstoy, every unhappy country is unhappy in its own way. Every country that asks to borrow from the IMF faces a unique set of circum-stances that requires a tailored response. The policy conditions and the mix of adjust-ment and financing must reflect the context. Throughout this decade, the Fund made a number of changes to its policies on conditionality, and it introduced new <b>specialized</b> <b>lending</b> windows in response to changing world conditions. This chapter reviews the overall pattern of Fund lending, policy advice, and technical assistance in the 1990 s and the various changes that the Fund introduced...|$|E
40|$|The paper aims {{to examine}} the new {{regulatory}} framework of project finance in the economics of banking firms. In particular, the paper investigates {{the uniqueness of the}} project finance, the significant importance of the project finance in bank activity, {{and the role of the}} new bank capital requirements to promote the innovative financial scheme. In the project finance business loans terms and characteristics are primarily based on the assets and quality of the project to be financed. It means that the usual bank rating models for lending business might not been implemented in the project finance lending. Quantitative estimates of credit risk could not be always possible in project finance lending. Consequently, the new regulatory capital requirements framework gives banks the option to implement a qualitative method – a supervisory slotting criteria approach – to evaluate credit risk in project finance lending business. The regulatory capital requirement recognizes project finance as <b>specialized</b> <b>lending.</b> The paper provides a summary of the treatment of the project finance in the New Basel Capital Accord. The paper is organized as follows. Section 1 provides a general description of project finance. Section 2 identifies the economic and financial uniqueness of project finance loans and credit risk assessment process. Section 3 delineates the impact of the new regulatory capital requirements framework on project finance lending. Final sections concludes. </p...|$|E
40|$|Historically, {{banks in}} the U. S. were the only {{depository}} institution that could offer checking deposits. They also tended to <b>specialize</b> in commercial <b>lending,</b> while thrifts (S&L's and mutual savings banks) tended to specialize in home mortgage lending and credit unions tended to <b>specialize</b> in consumer <b>lending.</b> Since 1980, the powers of these depository institutions have became more similar, due to legislation and regulatory changes. Consequently, credit unions have been increasingly in more direct competition with banks and thrifts. Because credit unions are cooperatives, if they can operate efficiently, they should have overall better interest rates than banks on both deposits and loans since they do not pay out dividends to stockholders. Credit union advocates and consumer groups have also argued that the credit union industry provides competition that also benefits banks customers. But, it has only been since December 2000 that any articles have shown in the peer-reviewed economic literature that indeed credit union competition with banks does in fact also benefit bank customers. This paper uses the regression estimates from two such studies to estimate the benefit in certificates-of-deposits (CDs) payments to bank customers that results from credit union competition. Of course, this implies that this benefit is a transfer from the bank stockholders to the bank customers. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} real estate markets and bank distress among German universal and specialized mortgage banks between 1995 and 2004. Higher house prices increase the value of collateral, which reduces the probability of bank distress (PDs). But higher prices at given rents may also indicate excessive expectations regarding {{the present value of}} real estate assets, which can increase PDs. Increasing price-to-rent ratios are positively related to PDs and larger real estate exposures amplify this effect. Rising real estate price levels alone reduce bank PDs, but only for banks with large real estate market exposure. This suggests a positive, but relatively small 'collateral' effect for banks with more expertise in <b>specialized</b> mortgage <b>lending.</b> Likewise, lower price-to-rent ratios are estimated to reduce the riskiness of banks. The multilevel logit model used here further shows that real estate markets are regionally segmented and location-specific effects contribute significantly to predicted bank PDs.
