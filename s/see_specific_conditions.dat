For example for discrete subgroups of Lie groups, virtually poly-infinite cyclic groups, Artin braid groups, a class of virtually poly-surface groups, virtually solvable linear group and 3 -manifold groups. In this article we <b>see</b> under which <b>specific</b> <b>conditions</b> the conjecture {{is true for the}} above classes of groups for the formulation of the conjecture in the setting of equivariant homology theory...|$|R
40|$|The {{escape from}} a {{metastable}} {{state is a}} problem that appears in many various fields such as fluid mechanics, chemistry or nuclear physics. Systems that are initially out of equilibrium display a transient behaviour during which relaxation in all degrees of freedom takes place. The proper understanding of transient effects occurring before a quasi-equilibrium is reached is important due to their direct connection with the viscosity of the studied medium. Fission is an excellent probe to study such relaxation effects on the subatomic scale. Due to the transient effects, before the quasi-equilibrium is achieved fission is purely or partly inhibited. This delay of fission is commonly called the transient time τtrans. In the present work (<b>see</b> [1]), very <b>specific</b> <b>conditions</b> for studying nuclear transient effects were achieved for the first time...|$|R

The phenomenon has been closely linked to modernization, industrialization and the sociological process of rationalization. Urbanization can be <b>seen</b> as a <b>specific</b> <b>condition</b> at a set time (e.g. the proportion of total population or area in cities or towns) or as an increase in that condition over time. So urbanization can be quantified either in terms of, say, the level of urban development relative to the overall population, or as {{the rate at which the}} urban proportion of the population is increasing. Urbanization creates enormous social, economic and environmental changes, which provide an opportunity for sustainability with the “potential to use resources more efficiently, to create more sustainable land use and to protect the biodiversity of natural ecosystems.” ...|$|R
40|$|Characteristically for a {{regulatory}} protein, the IRF- 1 tumor suppressor turns over rapidly with a half-life of between 20 – 40 min. This allows IRF- 1 to reach new steady state protein levels swiftly {{in response to}} changing environmental conditions. Whereas CHIP (C terminus of Hsc 70 -interacting protein), appears to chaperone IRF- 1 in unstressed cells, formation of a stable IRF- 1 ·CHIP complex is <b>seen</b> under <b>specific</b> stress <b>conditions.</b> Complex formation, in heat- or heavy metal-treated cells, {{is accompanied by a}} decrease in IRF- 1 steady state levels and an increase in IRF- 1 ubiquitination. CHIP binds directly to an intrinsically disordered domain in the central region of IRF- 1 (residues 106 – 140), and this site is sufficient to form a stable complex with CHIP in cells and to compete in trans with full-length IRF- 1, leading to a reduction in its ubiquitination. The study reveals a complex relationship between CHIP and IRF- 1 and highlights the role that direct binding or “docking” of CHIP to its substrate(s) can play in its mechanism of action as an E 3 ligase...|$|R
