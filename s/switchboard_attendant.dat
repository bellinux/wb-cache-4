50|$|Yates {{worked in}} several {{different}} power plants. Yates began working at the Utah Power and Light Company in July 1902 as a <b>switchboard</b> <b>attendant.</b> In 1903, he was made the foreman of a power plant. That same year, power plants in Utah went on strike, and Yates was hired to visit the different power plants and instruct workers. After that, he was made superintendent of the company's power plants. He had this job position from 1903 to 1906. In 1907, Yates started working as a consulting electrical engineer. He also built power plants including the Heber City and Murray power plants. Yates later performed tests on the New York City Subway for two years.|$|E
50|$|The Afon Clun {{marks the}} {{southern}} edge of the South Wales Coalfield. There are several former collieries {{to the north of the}} river. Many pits were begun in the 1860s in Beddau, Ty'n-y-nant and Gelynog pits being the most important, prior to which the area was mostly farmland. Cwm Colliery was sunk by the Great Western Colliery Company Limited in 1909 and this marked a rapid expansion of the population. In 1923 the Powell Duffryn Steam Coal Company sunk the Ynysmaerdy Colliery at Llantrisant, also known as the New Duffryn and Llantrisant Colliery, it had three shafts, employing 216 men. The Cwm was acquired by Powell Duffryn in 1928. In 1931 an underground railway linked the Cwm to the Maritime Colliery, Pontypridd and by 1934 the Cwm employed 100 men on the surface and 780 men underground. A methane gas explosion on bank holiday Monday, 2 June 1941, killed four men — Ernest Evans (Banksman), Noah Fletcher (Winding Engineman), John Gregor (Manager), and David Thomas (<b>Switchboard</b> <b>Attendant)</b> — and destroyed most of the surface buildings. The explosion would have caused far greater loss of life had it not occurred on a bank holiday. The colliery never reopened after the accident.|$|E
50|$|In systems without {{direct inward dial}} capability, all {{calls for}} a large {{organisation}} originally were placed to the facility's main number, where a <b>switchboard</b> operator or <b>attendant</b> would ask which extension or department the caller intended to reach. The call would then be transferred manually. As soon as the front office closed for the day, the system would be unusable for inbound calls.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the advent}} of Internet {{telephony}} (Voice over IP) technologies, PBX development has tended toward the IP PBX, which uses the Internet Protocol to carry calls. Most modern PBXs support VoIP. ISDN PBX systems also replaced some traditional PBXs in the 1990s, as ISDN offers features such as conference calling, call forwarding, and programmable caller ID. As of 2015 ISDN is being phased out by most major telecommunication carriers throughout Europe in favour of all-IP networks, with some expecting complete migration by 2025 Originally having started as an organization's manual <b>switchboard</b> or <b>attendant</b> console operated by a telephone operator or just simply the operator, PBXs have evolved into VoIP centers that are hosted by the operators or even manufacturers.|$|R
