25|$|Since the 1992 Games, {{the rules}} for {{combined}} changed, where the winner was determined by total time instead of points. The women's downhill was originally scheduled for Hafjell, but after protests it was moved to Kvitfjell, which also hosted the men's downhill and <b>super-G.</b> In the men's events, Germany's Markus Wasmeier won two disciplines, giant slalom and <b>super-G,</b> finishing ahead of the United States's Tommy Moe on the <b>super-G.</b> Moe won the downhill ahead of Norway's Kjetil André Aamodt, who came in third in the <b>super-G.</b> Austria's Thomas Stangassinger won the slalom ahead of Italy's Alberto Tomba.

Miller is one of 5 skiers who have won Olympic medals in 4 {{different}} disciplines, matching the feats of Kjetil André Aamodt and female racers Anja Pärson, Janica Kostelić and Katja Seizinger.|$|E
25|$|The last {{downhill}} race of {{the season}} at the World Cup finals was cancelled, so Maze finished as runner-up in the downhill standings, a single point behind Lindsey Vonn, whose season had ended in February after a knee injury at the World Championships. The last <b>super-G</b> race was also cancelled and Maze won the <b>super-G</b> title. In the last race, a giant slalom on 17 March, she gained her 11th victory {{of the season and}} finished with a record 2,414 points.|$|E
25|$|At the 2002 Winter Paralympics, {{disciplines}} {{for this}} classification {{were eligible for}} included the downhill, giant slalom, slalom and <b>super-G.</b> At the 2002 Winter Paralympics in alpine-skiing, this classification was not grouped with others for the men's giant slalom, giant slalom, <b>super-G,</b> and downhill events, and women's slalom, <b>super-G,</b> and downhill events. Two years later, at the 2004 World Championships, LW2 women had their own medal events in para-Alpine for events including the downhill. At the 2005 IPC Nordic Skiing World Championships, this class was grouped with other standing skiing classifications. In cross country, this class was eligible {{to compete in the}} men and women's 5km, 10km and 20km individual race. In the men and women's biathlon, this classification was again grouped with standing classes in the 7.4km race with 2 shooting stages 12.5km race which had four shooting stages. At the 2006 Winter Paralympics, events for this classification included the downhill and <b>super-G.</b> At the 2009 World Championships, this classification was grouped with other standing classes, with 3 of the 10 female skiers in the standing downhill event were from this class and the highest placed female finishing fifth. In the men's standing downhill, there were nine skiers from this class.|$|E
25|$|Eight British athletes {{competed in}} alpine skiing events, a {{decrease}} from the eleven who had {{competed in the}} 1992 Games. Six of the athletes had previous Games experience. A total of four bronze medals were won by British skiers. Richard Burt medalled in both the giant slalom and <b>super-G</b> B3 classification, {{as he had done}} in 1992. Matthew Stockford, who won three bronze medals at the previous Games, took home a bronze in the <b>super-G</b> LXW and James Barker won bronze in the downhill LWXI.|$|E
25|$|Miller {{followed}} his Olympic {{success with the}} mediocre season, but still managed to finish Top 3 in three occasions. He was third at the city event in Munich, second to Didier Cuche at Kitzbuehel's downhill and third in <b>super-G</b> at Hinterstoder. He started World Championships in Garmisch-Partenkirchen with typical Bode-like fashion at <b>super-G</b> race. He was leading the field despite losing a pole midway through the course, however he lost his balance {{coming out of a}} bend at the bottom, slowed down and stood up as he crossed the finish line on 12th position.|$|E
25|$|In para-Alpine skiing events, this {{classification}} is grouped with standing classes, who are seeded {{to start}} after visually impaired classes and before sitting {{classes in the}} slalom and giant slalom. In downhill, <b>Super-G</b> and Super Combined, this same group competes after the visually impaired classes and sitting classes. For alpine events, a skier is required to have their ski poles or equivalent equipment planted in the snow {{in front of the}} starting position {{before the start of the}} race. The IPC advises event organisers to run the men's standing ski group after the blind men's group and before the blind women's group. Women's standing classes are advised to go last. During the 2005/2006 para-Alpine ski season, the giant slalom had a factor of 1.000. The 2011/2012 alpine-skiing season factoring for LW6/8.1 was 0.9902 for Slalom, 0.995 for Giant Slalom, 0.9969 for <b>Super-G</b> and 0.998 for downhill, and for LW6/8.2 was 0.9926 for slalom, 1 for giant slalom, 1 for <b>Super-G</b> and 1 for downhill.|$|E
25|$|At the 2002 Winter Paralympics, women's Downhill and men's {{visually}} impaired Downhill were held on day 1 with men's standing and sitting Downhill {{taking place on}} day 2.
