5|$|S. iniae {{is highly}} {{pathogenic}} in freshwater, marine, and euryhaline fish, and is highly lethal: outbreaks {{may be associated}} with 30–50% mortality. It is, therefore, one of the foremost economically important pathogens in intensive aquaculture. In 1997, the global economic impact of S.iniae infection to the aquaculture industry was estimated at US$100million (one-tenth of which in the United States). As of 2007, infection had been reported in 27 species of fish, including tilapia (genus Oreochromis and Tilapia), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), Japanese amberjack (<b>Seriola</b> quinqueradiata), red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), and barramundi (Lates calcarifer, which can be an asymptomatic carrier). Common carp (Cyprinus carpio), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), and goldfish (Carassius auratus) appear to be resistant. Fish raised in intensive aquaculture operations and subject to environmental stressors (i.e. suboptimal temperature, poor water quality, crowding, handling, etc.) are most prone to S.iniae infection. Wild fish populations located both near and far from aquaculture operations have also proven susceptible to S.iniae infection.|$|E

25|$|The {{rainbow runner}} {{is the only}} species in the {{monotypic}} genus Elagatis, {{which is one of}} thirty genera in the jack family, Carangidae. The Carangidae are Perciform fishes in the suborder Percoidei. The species was first scientifically described in 1825 by French zoologists Jean René Constant Quoy and Joseph Paul Gaimard based on the type specimen collected from the Indian Ocean, somewhere in the Malay Archipelago. They named the species <b>Seriola</b> bipinnulata, believing the species was related to the amberjacks. This was later revised to the genus Seriolichthys by Bleeker before it was concluded the species warranted a new genus. The genus Micropteryx was initially created, but was already in use in the Lepidoptera. In 1840, Frederick Debell Bennett created the genus Elagatis, taken from a name published in a whaling voyage memoir, which he used in combination with the species name of bipinnulatus, which was deemed to be incorrect as the genus name is feminine and the original spelling of bipinnulata was reinstated. Phylogenetically, the species is most closely related to the amberjack genus, <b>Seriola,</b> being the most basal member identified of the carangid subfamily Naucratini. This has been determined by the sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome b genome, as well as older morphological studies.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT-The {{sensitivity}} of yellowtail Senola quinqueradiata and {{red sea bream}} Pagrus major tq Nocardia <b>seriolae</b> was investigated. The LDso for yellowtail and red sea bream after being injected with N. <b>seriolae</b> was 1. 1 x 103 CFU/l 00 9 B. W. and 3. 4 x 104 CFU/l 00 g B. W., respectively. In an immersion challenge, the LDso for yellowtail was 1. 2 x 104 CFU/mL, while no mortality was observed in red sea bream at 1. 0 x 105 CFUlmL for 26 days. These data indicate that yellowtail is {{more sensitive to the}} bacterium than red sea bream. Serum bactericidal activity against N. <b>seriolae</b> was not observed in both fish species. Production of superoxide anion in kid-ney phagocytes isolated from red sea bream significantly increased in response to addition of live N. <b>seriolae.</b> However, such increase of superoxide anion production was not detected in yellowtail kidney phagocytes.

40|$|Relationships {{between the}} three classes of Neodermata (parasitic Platyhelminthes) are much debated and {{restrict}} {{our understanding of the}} evolution of parasitism and contingent adaptations. The historic view of a sister relationship between Cestoda and Monogenea (Cercomeromorphae; larvae bearing posterior hooks) has been dismissed and the weight of evidence against monogenean monophyly has mounted. We present the nucleotide sequence of the complete mitochondrial (mt) genome of Benedenia <b>seriolae</b> (Monogenea: Monopisthocotylea: Capsalidae), the first complete non-gyrodactylid monopisthocotylean mt genome to be reported. We also include nucleotide sequence data for some mt protein coding genes for a second capsalid, Neobenedenia sp. Analyses of the new mt genomes with all available platyhelminth mt genomes provide new phylogenetic hypotheses, which strongly influence perspectives on the evolution of diet in the Neodermata. Our analyses do not support monogenean monophyly but confirm that the Digenea and Cestoda are each monophyletic and sister groups. Epithelial feeding monopisthocotyleans on fish hosts are basal in the Neodermata and represent the first shift to parasitism from free-living ancestors. The next evolutionary step in parasitism was a dietary change from epithelium to blood. The common ancestor of Digenea+Cestoda was monogenean-like and most likely sanguinivorous. From this ancestral condition, adult digeneans and cestodes independently evolved dietary specialisations to suit their diverse microhabitats in their final vertebrate hosts. These improved perspectives on relationships fundamentally enhance our understanding of the evolution of parasitism in the Neodermata and in particular, the evolution of diet. Elizabeth M.

40|$|The Capsalidae is {{a diverse}} family of ectoparasites of marine fish (Platyhelminthes: Monogenea). It {{is a large}} family with {{approximately}} 180 described species and many more yet to be discovered. Capsalids have a global distribution and parasitise a diversity of hosts from the Chondrichthyes to bony fishes. A morphological classification exists for the family based on a few key characters such as testes number, their arrangement and morphology of the posterior attachment organ (haptor). Phylogenetic relationships within the family and its position within the Monogenea are largely unexplored. I have used various molecular phylogenetic techniques to resolve relationships and explore the evolution and radiation of this family. Specimens from the Capsalidae and other monogenean families (outgroups) were obtained through fresh collections and generous donations by other parasitologists. Specimens were stored in 95 % undenatured ethanol. Three unlinked nuclear genes (28 S ribosomal RNA, Histone 3 and Elongation Factor 1 α) and two mitochondrial genes (Cytochrome Oxidase 3 and Cytochrome B) were amplified for 78 capsalid taxa in 28 genera representing all nine subfamilies and 30 outgroup taxa (eight Polyopisthocotylea and 22 Monopisthocotylea). Analyses showed the Capsalidae is monophyletic, with the sister group remaining unresolved. Some analyses supported Gyrodactylidae and Udonellidae as the sister group but in other analyses, it was unresolved with the Monocotylidae and Microbothriidae also possible sister groups. The Capsalinae, Encotyllabinae and Nitzschiinae are monophyletic, but analyses did not support monophyly for the Benedeniinae, Entobdellinae and Trochopodinae. Monophyly was supported for Capsala, Capsaloides, Encotyllabe, Entobdella, Listrocephalos, Neobenedenia, Nitzschia and Tristoma, but Metabenedeniella is paraphyletic and Benedenia and Neoentobdella are polyphyletic. Comparisons {{of the distribution of}} character states for the small number of morphological characters on a molecular phylogeny show a high frequency of apparent homoplasy. Consequently the current morphological classification for the Capsalidae shows little correspondence with the phylogenetic hypotheses I present. I also sequenced the first complete mitochondrial (mt) genome for a capsalid species, Benedenia <b>seriolae.</b> The mt genome of B. <b>seriolae</b> shows some tRNA rearrangements in comparison to three Gyrodactylus spp. (Gyrodactylidae), the only other complete monopisthocotylean mt genomes sequenced. It also lacks the duplicated, conserved non-coding regions present in Gyrodactylus spp. making the genome smaller in size. I combined this genome with other available platyhelminth mt genomes to investigate the monophyly of Monogenea and the evolution of diet across the Neodermata. Results confirm paraphyly for the Monogenea and also suggest paraphyly for the epidermal feeding Monopisthocotylea. I hypothesise that the Monopisthocotylea represent the first shift to parasitism in the Neodermata from a free living ancestor and following this, there was a dietary shift to blood feeding (Polyopisthocotylea). The Digenea and Cestoda independently evolved dietary specialisations to suit their diverse microhabitats and broad range of vertebrate final hosts. Using Elongation Factor 1 α I have estimated molecular divergence dates for the Neodermata, Monogenea and Capsalidae. Molecular clock analyses estimate the Neodermata diverged from the free living platyhelminths 513 million years ago (mya) (95 % HPD [highest posterior density]: 473 – 605) before the appearance of vertebrates in the fossil record. The Monogenea diverged from the other neodermatan classes 441 mya (95 % HPD: 420 – 547) coinciding with the appearance of fish in the fossil record. The most recent common ancestor of the Capsalidae arose approximately 235 million years ago (95 % HPD: 200 – 274) following the Permian/Triassic extinction event and coinciding with the diversification of bony fishes in the marine environment. I compared the capsalid phylogeny to a phylogeny of fishes that I generated using eight nuclear and three mt genes to explore the evolution and the radiation of the Capsalidae across fishes. There is no significant global signal of coevolution with only five parasite-host associations that may be a result of coevolution. Estimated molecular divergence dates are also compared and do not reveal temporal congruence. Radiation of the family may have been driven by host switching constrained by shared host ecology, biology, behaviour and plasticity in morphological adaptations by the parasites. This study advances our understanding of the evolution of this monogenean family and provides insights into the evolution of the Neodermata and the complicated realities of reconstructing the evolutionary history of parasitic groups.

40|$|Benedenia Diesing, 1858, a genus of capsalid (benedeniine) monogeneans, is redefined. The generic {{diagnosis}} is amended to include: {{the path of}} tendons in the haptor from extrinsic muscles in the body; presence and form of the marginal valve; a penis occupying a penis canal with weakly muscular wall; a weakly muscular accessory gland reservoir proximal to the penis and enclosed by a proximal extension of {{the wall of the}} penis canal; male and female genital apertures usually common, rarely separate; vagina with pore usually close to the common genital pore but may open in mid body between the germarium and the common genital pore, or anterior to the common genital pore. A conservative approach is adopted and the generic {{diagnosis is}} clarified and broadened to accommodate species that display some variation in reproductive anatomy, especially of the female system. We argue against potential alternative actions such as defining Benedenia strictly to contain species with separate male and female genital apertures and against recognition of a separate genus, Tareenia Hussey, 1986, for species with a vaginal pore anterior to the common genital pore. Under our conception, Benedenia comprises 21 species: B. sciaenae (van Beneden, 1856) Odhner, 1905 (type species); B. acanthopagri (Hussey, 1986) comb. nov.; B. anticavaginata Byrnes, 1986; B. bodiani Yamaguti, 1968; B. elongata (Yamaguti, 1968) Egorova, 1997; B. epinepheli (Yamaguti, 1937) Meserve, 1938; B. hawaiiensis Yamaguti, 1968; B. hendorffi(von Linstow, 1889) Odhner, 1905; B. hoshinai Ogawa, 1984; B. innobilitata Burhnheim Gomes and Varela, 1973 : B. jaliscana Bravo-Hollis, 1952; B. lolo Yamaguti, 1968; B. lutjani Whittington and Kearn, 1993 : B. monticellii (Parona and Perugia, 1895) Johnston, 1929; B. ovata (Goto, 1894) Johnston. 1929 : B. pompatica Burhnheim, Gomes and Varela, 1973; B. rohdei Whittington, Kearn and Beverley-Burton, 1994; B. scari Yamaguti, 1968; B. sekii (Yamaguti, 1937) Meserve, 1938; B, <b>seriolae</b> (Yamaguti, 1934) Meserve, 1938; and B. synagris Yamaguti, 1953. The type species, B. sciaenae, is redescribed based on new material from Australia. No types for this taxon were designated and we have assigned a series of voucher specimens. Tareenia acanthopagri Hussey, 1986 becomes B. acanthopagri (Hussey, 1986) comb. nov. and T. anticavaginata (Byrnes, 1986) Egorova, 1997 and T. lutjani (Whittington and Kearn, 1993) Egorova, 1997 are returned to Benedenia as B. anticavaginata and B. lutjani Benedenia akaisaki Iwata, 1990 is considered a synonym of B. ovata and B. kintoki Iwata, 1990 is considered a synonym of B. elongata. Two species, B, madai Ishii and Sawada, 1938 and B. pagrosomi Ishii and Sawada, 1938, are considered species inquirendae. Based on the redefinition of Benedenia, the diagnosis for the Benedeniinae is amended. Tareenia is synonymized with Benedenia but Menziesia Gibson, 1976 is recognized and its generic diagnosis amended to include: anterior attachment organs tending to form a 2 ̆ 7 hooded 2 ̆ 7 appearance; prominent anterior gland cells between the pharynx and the anterior margin of the body: long penis, tapering proximally, occupying a penis canal with weakly muscular wall: penis canal and penis describe a sigmoid; accessory gland reservoir dorsal and alongside, or posterior and lateral to, proximal end of the penis and enclosed by a proximal extension of the wall of the penis canal. Under this conception. Menziesia comprises: M. noblei (Menzies. 1946) Gibson, 1976 (type species); M. malaboni (Velasquez. 1982) comb. nov. : M. merinthe (Yamaguti, 1968) Gibson. 1976 : M. ovalis (Yamaguti, 1968) Gibson, 1976 : and M. sebastodis (Yamaguti, 1934) comb, nov.
