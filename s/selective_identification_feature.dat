50|$|In {{the neutral}} loss scan method both Q1 and Q3 are scanned together, {{but with a}} {{constant}} mass offset. This allows the selective recognition of all ions which, by fragmentation in q2, lead {{to the loss of}} a given neutral fragment (e.g., H2O, NH3). Similar to the precursor ion scan, this method is useful in the <b>selective</b> <b>identification</b> of closely related compounds in a mixture.|$|R

40|$|Identification of {{unwanted}} microbial contaminants microscopically observed in food products is challenging {{due to their}} low abundance in a complex matrix, quite often containing other microorganisms. Therefore, a <b>selective</b> <b>identification</b> method was developed using laser capture microdissection in combination with direct-captured cell PCR. This procedure was validated with Geobacillus stearothermophilus and further used to identify microbial contaminants present in some industrial milk samples. The microscopically observed contaminants were identified as mainly Methylobacterium species...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{demonstrate}} the potential of selective reagent ionisation-time of flight-mass spectrometry for the rapid and <b>selective</b> <b>identification</b> of a popular new psychoactive substance blend called ‘synthacaine’, a mixture {{that is supposed to}} imitate the sensory and intoxicating effects of cocaine. Reactions with H 3 O+ result in protonated parent molecules which can be tentatively assigned to benzocaine and methiopropamine. However, by comparing the product ion branching ratios obtained at two reduced electric field values (90 and 170 Td) for two reagent ions (H 3 O+ and NO+) to those of the pure chemicals, we show that identification is possible with a much higher level of confidence then when relying solely on the m/z of protonated parent molecules. A rapid and highly <b>selective</b> analytical <b>identification</b> of the constituents of a recreational drug is particularly crucial to medical personnel for the prompt medical treatment of overdoses, toxic effects or allergic reactions...|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{a new strategy}} for the identification of material parameters {{in the case of}} restricted or redundant data, based on a hybrid approach combining a genetic algorithm and the Levenberg-Marquardt method. The proposed methodology consists essentially in a statistically based topological analysis of the search domain, after this one has been reduced by the analysis of the parameters ranges. This is used to identify the parameters of a model representing the behavior of damaged elastic, visco-elastic, plastic and visco-plastic composite laminates. Optimization of the experimental tests on tubular samples leads to the <b>selective</b> <b>identification</b> of these parameters...|$|R

40|$|An {{algorithm}} for {{detection of}} electrical potentials characteristic for simple (SS) and complex spikes (CS) of the cerebellar Purkinje cells (PC) is presented. The algorithm {{is based on}} determination of front of signals to be detected, forming of feature description of impulses taking into account their duration and amplitude dynamics in successive bins, and on comparing vectors describing a chosen template of impulse and the current signal. The results of algorithm testing on artificial sequences of impulses and neuronal activity recordings are described which demonstrate a high accuracy of impulse front detection and possibility of <b>selective</b> <b>identification</b> of SS and CS having similar polarity, amplitude and duration of initial components...|$|R
40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} two- and higher dimensional pattern matching, i. e. the identification of instances of a template within a larger signal space, which {{is a form of}} registration. Unlike traditional correlation, we aim at obtaining more selective matchings by considering more strict comparisons of gray-level intensity. In order to achieve fast matching, a nonlinear thresholded version of the fast Fourier transform is applied to a gray-level decomposition of the original 2 D image. The potential of the method is substantiated with respect to real data involving the <b>selective</b> <b>identification</b> of neuronal cell bodies in gray-level images.

5000|$|In {{a neutral}} loss scan, the first mass {{analyzer}} scans all the masses. The second mass analyzer also scans, {{but at a}} set offset from the first mass analyzer. [...] This offset corresponds to a neutral loss that is commonly observed for the class of compounds. In a constant-neutral-loss scan, all precursors that undergo {{the loss of a}} specified common neutral are monitored. To obtain this information, both mass analyzers are scanned simultaneously, but with a mass offset that correlates with the mass of the specified neutral. Similar to the precursor-ion scan, this technique is also useful in the <b>selective</b> <b>identification</b> of closely related class of compounds in a mixture.|$|R
