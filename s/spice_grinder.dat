5000|$|Cassia bark (both {{powdered}} and in whole, or [...] "stick" [...] form) {{is used as}} a {{flavouring agent}} for confectionery, desserts, pastries, and meat; it is specified in many curry recipes, where Ceylon cinnamon is less suitable. Cassia is sometimes added to Ceylon cinnamon, but is a much thicker, coarser product. Cassia is sold as pieces of bark (as pictured below) or as neat quills or sticks. Cassia sticks can be distinguished from Ceylon cinnamon sticks in this manner: Ceylon cinnamon sticks have many thin layers and can easily be made into powder using a coffee or <b>spice</b> <b>grinder,</b> whereas cassia sticks are extremely hard and are usually made up of one thick layer.|$|E
50|$|The barks of {{the species}} are easily {{distinguished}} when whole, both in macroscopic and microscopic characteristics. Ceylon cinnamon sticks (quills) have many thin layers and can easily be made into powder using a coffee or <b>spice</b> <b>grinder,</b> whereas cassia sticks are much harder. Indonesian cinnamon is often sold in neat quills made up of one thick layer, capable of damaging a spice or coffee grinder. Saigon cinnamon (C. loureiroi) and Chinese cinnamon (C. cassia) are always sold as broken pieces of thick bark, as the bark is not supple enough to be rolled into quills. The powdered bark is harder to distinguish, {{but if it is}} treated with tincture of iodine (a test for starch), little effect is visible with pure Ceylon cinnamon, but when Chinese cinnamon is present, a deep-blue tint is produced.|$|E
50|$|Special purpose coffee {{grinders}} {{usually are}} either blade grinders or burr grinders: blade grinders being {{less expensive and}} having additional uses, burr grinders giving {{a better quality of}} grind (see Coffee preparation#Grinding). Special purpose <b>spice</b> <b>grinders</b> usually are either blade grinders or mortar and pestle (or related tools).|$|R

CHROMA also sells <b>spice</b> <b>grinders,</b> knife {{sharpening}} stones, kitchen shears and other cooking accessories. The focus on Chroma Cnives is the professional user.

50|$|Although ethnic Indians {{no longer}} tend to stay solely {{segregated}} {{in one place}} as previously arranged under the modern People's Action Party (PAP) policy of racial harmony, {{for the sake of}} cultural heritage, many of the ethnically Indian commercial or cottage industry usages are concentrated in Little India, although Indian-dominant commercial zones are also found in HDB estates. Contrary to stereotypes, Little India is not solely an Indian neighbourhood. Located in the neighbourhood alongside shops that cater predominantly to the Indians are Chinese clan associations, places of worship of different religions, and a variety of different business ranging from electrical supplies, hardware, second-hand goods alongside traditional <b>spice</b> <b>grinders</b> and grocers. One of the more prominent examples of cross-cultural patronage besides those regarding food is that many Chinese parents go to shops in Little India to grind rice to make congee for infants. The machinery used in this instance was initially flown in from India to grind spices into powder for use in Indian cuisine. Little India differs from many other neighbourhoods in Singapore in many ways. Tekka Market is also multi-cultural, with produce and sundries that cater to the many ethnic groups in Singapore.|$|R
