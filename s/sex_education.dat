5|$|Raëlians {{say they}} {{encourage}} adult homosexual, bisexual, and heterosexual relationships and that society should recognize them legally. Some Swiss government authorities responded to Raëlians' views about Sensual Meditation with {{a fear that}} Raëlians are a threat to public morals for supporting liberalized <b>sex</b> <b>education</b> for children. They express the view that such liberalized <b>sex</b> <b>education</b> teaches youngsters how to obtain sexual gratification which would encourage sexual abuse of underage children.|$|E
5|$|Abstinence-only <b>sex</b> <b>education</b> {{does not}} reduce teenage {{pregnancy}}. Teen pregnancy rates are higher in students given abstinence-only education, {{as compared with}} comprehensive <b>sex</b> <b>education.</b> Some authorities recommend that those using abstinence as a primary method have backup method(s) available (such as condoms or emergency contraceptive pills). Deliberate non-penetrative sex without vaginal sex or deliberate oral sex without vaginal sex are also sometimes considered birth control. While this generally avoids pregnancy, pregnancy can still occur with intercrural sex {{and other forms of}} penis-near-vagina sex (genital rubbing, and the penis exiting from anal intercourse) where sperm can be deposited near the entrance to the vagina and can travel along the vagina's lubricating fluids.|$|E

Hemmings received little response from heads of state comprehensive schools.|$|E

5|$|The Sex Party was a {{political}} party based in British Columbia, Canada. The party was guided by {{the philosophy of the}} sex-positive movement.

They advocated for the repeal of laws that promote antisexualism, such as prostitution laws and censorship.

Karmal, who had moved into the computer industry, set up a model agency for her, ExSell Management, although it was not successful. In 1987, Mills went to live in Paris, telling Karmal that a cosmetics company had given her a modelling contract, but became the mistress of millionaire Lebanese businessman George Kazan for two years and took part in a photo session for a stills-only German <b>sex</b> <b>education</b> manual called Die Freuden der Liebe (The Joys of Love).|$|E
5|$|In teenagers, pregnancies are {{at greater}} risk of poor outcomes. Comprehensive <b>sex</b> <b>education</b> and access to birth control {{decreases}} the rate of unwanted pregnancies in this age group. While all forms of birth control can generally be used by young people, long-acting reversible birth control such as implants, IUDs, or vaginal rings are more successful in reducing rates of teenage pregnancy. After the delivery of a child, a woman who is not exclusively breastfeeding may become pregnant again after as few as four to six weeks. Some methods of birth control can be started immediately following the birth, while others require a delay of up to six months. In women who are breastfeeding, progestin-only methods are preferred over combined oral birth control pills. In women who have reached menopause, it is recommended that birth control be continued for one year after the last period.|$|E

5|$|Not {{only does}} SCI present {{children}} and adolescents {{with many of the}} same difficulties adults face, it affects the development of their sexuality. Although substantial research exists on SCI and sexuality in adults, very little exists on the ways in which it affects development of sexuality in young people. Injured {{children and adolescents}} need ongoing, age-appropriate <b>sex</b> <b>education</b> that addresses questions of SCI as it relates to sexuality and sexual function. Very young children become aware of their disabilities before their sexuality, but as they age they become curious just as able-bodied children do, and it is appropriate to provide them with increasing amounts of information. Caregivers help the child and family prepare for transition into adulthood, including in sexuality and social interaction, beginning early and intensifying during adolescence. Parents need education about the effects of SCI on sexual function so that they can answer their children's questions.|$|E
5|$|Wall {{describes}} the marriage as traumatic, with frequent rapes and miscarriages. She recounts {{that she did}} not receive any <b>sex</b> <b>education</b> while in school and as a result was unable to understand her husband's advances. As her marriage with her cousin fell apart, she began to spend nights sleeping in her truck, and at that point met former FLDS member Lamont Barlow. Wall, then 17, began an affair with the then 25-year-old Barlow, who encouraged her to leave the church with him. The affair was eventually uncovered when she became pregnant by him, and Jeffs had the marriage to Steed annulled. Wall left the FLDS and married Barlow, having two children with him.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1970s, Valiente {{became a member}} of a far right white {{nationalist}} political party, the National Front, for about eighteen months, during which she designed a banner for her local branch. Valiente's biographer Philip Heselton suggested that the party's nationalistic outlook may have appealed to her strongly patriotic values and that she might have hoped that the Front would serve as a political equivalent to the Pagan movement. At the same time she also {{became a member of}} another, more extreme far right group, the Northern League. However, she allowed her membership of the National Front to lapse, sending a letter to her local branch stating that although she respected its leader John Tyndall and had made friends within the group, she was critical of the party's opposition to women's liberation, gay rights, and <b>sex</b> <b>education,</b> all of which she lauded as progressive causes. Heselton has also suggested that Valiente may have joined these groups in order to investigate them before reporting back to Britain's intelligence agencies.|$|E
