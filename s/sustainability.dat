5|$|Some of {{the best}} known and most widely used <b>sustainability</b> {{measures}} include corporate <b>sustainability</b> reporting, Triple Bottom Line accounting, World <b>Sustainability</b> Society, Circles of <b>Sustainability,</b> and estimates of the quality of <b>sustainability</b> governance for individual countries using the Environmental <b>Sustainability</b> Index and Environmental Performance Index.|$|E
5|$|In ecology, <b>sustainability</b> (from sustain and ability) is the {{property}} of biological systems to remain diverse and productive indefinitely. Long-lived and healthy wetlands and forests are examples of sustainable biological systems. In more general terms, <b>sustainability</b> is the endurance of systems and processes. The organizing principle for <b>sustainability</b> is sustainable development, which includes the four interconnected domains: ecology, economics, politics and culture. <b>Sustainability</b> science {{is the study of}} sustainable development and environmental science.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sustainability</b> {{measurement}} is a {{term that}} denotes the measurements used as the quantitative basis for the informed management of <b>sustainability.</b> The metrics used for the measurement of <b>sustainability</b> (involving the <b>sustainability</b> of environmental, social and economic domains, both individually and in various combinations) are evolving: they include indicators, benchmarks, audits, <b>sustainability</b> standards and certification systems like Fairtrade and Organic, indexes and accounting, as well as assessment, appraisal and other reporting systems. They are applied {{over a wide range}} of spatial and temporal scales.|$|E
5|$|The Circles of <b>Sustainability</b> {{assessment}} of Delhi gives a marginally more favourable {{impression of the}} ecological <b>sustainability</b> of the city only because {{it is based on}} a more comprehensive series of measures than only air pollution. Part of the reason that the city remains assessed at basic <b>sustainability</b> is because of the low resource-use and carbon emissions of its poorer neighbourhoods.|$|E
5|$|The Council on Environmental Stewardship and <b>Sustainability,</b> made up {{of representatives}} from various departments, is {{exploring}} ways to improve <b>sustainability.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{philosophical}} and analytic framework of <b>sustainability</b> draws on and connects with many different disciplines and fields; {{in recent years}} {{an area that has}} come to be called <b>sustainability</b> science has emerged.|$|E
5|$|Though UCSC {{has been}} known for its {{conservation}} efforts and environmentally minded students since it was founded, since 2000 enthusiasm for the UCSC <b>sustainability</b> movement has grown steadily among students and administrators alike. Students established the Student Environmental Center (SEC) in 2001, have held annual Earth Summits, and established a <b>sustainability</b> funding body, the Campus <b>Sustainability</b> Council. In 2004, the UC Policy on Sustainable Practices was released, stating that the University of California Office of the President was committed to minimizing its impact on the environment and reducing its dependence on non-renewable energy. This set the scene for huge breakthroughs in 2006, when a Committee on <b>Sustainability</b> and Stewardship (CSS) was established and a campus-wide <b>Sustainability</b> Assessment was completed. The following year, the pilot <b>Sustainability</b> Office was created to help institutionalize <b>sustainability,</b> coordinate communication and collaboration between the many entities already engaged in campus <b>sustainability</b> activities at UCSC, support policy implementation, and serve as a resource for the campus. <b>Sustainability</b> has become a major part of every aspect of the campus, and students, staff, and faculty campus-wide are working toward <b>sustainability</b> in a variety of different ways.|$|E
5|$|Another model {{suggests}} humans {{attempt to}} achieve {{all of their}} needs and aspirations via seven modalities: economy, community, occupational groups, government, environment, culture, and physiology. From the global to the individual human scale, {{each of the seven}} modalities can be viewed across seven hierarchical levels. Human <b>sustainability</b> can be achieved by attaining <b>sustainability</b> in all levels of the seven modalities.|$|E
5|$|Application {{of social}} <b>sustainability</b> {{requires}} stakeholders {{to look at}} human and labor rights, prevention of human trafficking, and other human rights risks. These issues {{should be considered in}} production and procurement of various worldwide commodities. The international community has identified many industries whose practices have been known to violate social <b>sustainability,</b> and many of these industries have organizations in place that aid in verifying the social <b>sustainability</b> of products and services. The Equator Principles (financial industry), Fair Wear Foundation (garments), and Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition are examples of such organizations and initiatives. Resources are also available for verifying the life-cycle of products and the producer or vendor level, such as Green Seal for cleaning products, NSF-140 for carpet production, and even labeling of Organic food in the United States.|$|E

5|$|The most {{important}} <b>sustainability</b> fact about bismuth is its byproduct status, which can either improve <b>sustainability</b> (i.e., vanadium or manganese nodules) or, for bismuth from lead ore, constrain it; bismuth is constrained. The {{extent to which}} the constraint on bismuth can be relieved is going to be tested by the future of the lead storage battery, since 90% of the world market for lead is currently in storage batteries for gasoline or diesel-powered motor vehicles.|$|E
