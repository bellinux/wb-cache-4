40|$|A fractal bears {{a complex}} {{structure}} that {{is reflected in}} a <b>scaling</b> <b>hierarchy,</b> indicating that {{there are far more}} small things than large ones. This <b>scaling</b> <b>hierarchy</b> can be effectively derived using head/tail breaks - a clustering and visualization tool for data with a heavy-tailed distribution - and quantified by an ht-index, indicating the number of clusters or hierarchical levels, a head/tail breaks-induced integer. However, this integral ht-index {{has been found to be}} less precise for many fractals at their different phrases of development. This paper refines the ht-index as a fraction to measure the <b>scaling</b> <b>hierarchy</b> of a fractal more precisely within a coherent whole, and further assigns a fractional ht-index - the fht-index - to an individual data value of a data series that represents the fractal. We developed two case studies to demonstrate the advantages of the fht-index, in comparison with the ht-index. We found that the fractional ht-index or fractional hierarchy in general can help characterize a fractal set or pattern in a much more precise manner. The index may help create intermediate map scales between two consecutive map scales. Keywords: Ht-index, fractal, scaling, complexity, fht-indexComment: 7 pages, 2 figure...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new classification scheme - head/tail breaks - {{in order to}} find groupings or hierarchy for data with a heavy-tailed distribution. The heavy-tailed distributions are heavily right skewed, with a minority of large values in the head and a majority of small values in the tail, commonly characterized by a power law, a lognormal or an exponential function. For example, a country's population is often distributed in such a heavy-tailed manner, with a minority of people (e. g., 20 percent) in the countryside and the vast majority (e. g., 80 percent) in urban areas. This heavy-tailed distribution is also called <b>scaling,</b> <b>hierarchy</b> or <b>scaling</b> <b>hierarchy.</b> This new classification scheme partitions all of the data values around the mean into two parts and continues the process iteratively for the values (above the mean) in the head until the head part values are no longer heavy-tailed distributed. Thus, the number of classes and the class intervals are both naturally determined. We therefore claim that the new classification scheme is more natural than the natural breaks in finding the groupings or hierarchy for data with a heavy-tailed distribution. We demonstrate the advantages of the head/tail breaks method over Jenks' natural breaks in capturing the underlying hierarchy of the data.

The way supersymmetry protects <b>scale</b> <b>hierarchies</b> is the following: since for every particle there is a superpartner with the same mass but different statistics, any loop in a radiative correction is cancelled by the loop corresponding to its superpartner, rendering the theory more UV finite.|$|R
40|$|Multiplicative random {{processes}} in (not necessaryly equilibrium or steady state) stochastic systems with many {{degrees of freedom}} lead to Boltzmann distributions when the dynamics is {{expressed in terms of}} the logarithm of the normalized elementary variables.

40|$|The {{version of}} the warp model that we {{proposed}} to explain the mass <b>scale</b> <b>hierarchy</b> has been extended {{by the introduction of}} one or more singularities in the metric. We restricted ourselves to a real massless scalar field supposed to propagate in a five dimensional bulk with the extradimension being compactified on a strip or on a circle. With the same emphasis on the hermiticity and commutativity properties of the Kakuza Klein operators, we have established all the allowed boundary conditions to be imposed on the fields. From them, for given positions of the singularities, one can deduce either mass eigenvalues building up a Kaluza Klein tower, or a tachyon, or a zero mass state. Assuming the Planck mass to be the high mass scale and by a choice, unique for all boundary conditions, of the major warp parameters, the low lying mass eigenvalues are of the order of the TeV, in this way explaining the mass <b>scale</b> <b>hierarchy.</b> In our model, the physical masses are related to the Kaluza Klein eigenvalues, depending on the location of the physical brane which is an arbitrary parameter of the model. Illustrative numerical calculations are given to visualize the structure of Kaluza Klein mass eigenvalue towers. Observation at high energy colliders like LHC of a mass tower with its characteristic structure would be the fingerprint of the model. Comment: 33 pages, 1 figur...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background As one ages, physical, cognitive, and {{clinical}} problems accumulate and {{the pattern of}} loss follows a distinct progression. The first areas requiring outside support are the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living and over time {{there is a need}} for support in performing the Activities of Daily Living. Two new functional hierarchies are presented, an IADL hierarchical capacity scale and a combination scale integrating both IADL and ADL hierarchies. Methods A secondary analyses of data from a cross-national sample of community residing persons was conducted using 762, 023 interRAI assessments. The development of the new IADL Hierarchy and a new IADL-ADL combined scale proceeded through a series of interrelated steps first examining individual IADL and ADL item scores among persons receiving home care and those living independently without services. A factor analysis demonstrated the overall continuity across the IADL-ADL continuum. Evidence of the validity of the scales was explored with associative analyses of factors such as a cross-country distributional analysis for persons in home care programs, a count of functional problems across the categories of the hierarchy, an assessment of the hours of informal and formal care received each week by persons in the different categories of the hierarchy, and finally, evaluation of the relationship between cognitive status and the hierarchical IADL-ADL assignments. Results Using items from interRAI’s suite of assessment instruments, two new functional scales were developed, the interRAI IADL <b>Hierarchy</b> <b>Scale</b> and the interRAI IADL-ADL Functional <b>Hierarchy</b> <b>Scale.</b> The IADL <b>Hierarchy</b> <b>Scale</b> consisted of 5 items, meal preparation, housework, shopping, finances and medications. The interRAI IADL-ADL Functional <b>Hierarchy</b> <b>Scale</b> was created through an amalgamation of the ADL Hierarchy (developed previously) and IADL <b>Hierarchy</b> <b>Scales.</b> These scales cover the spectrum of IADL and ADL challenges faced by persons in the community. Conclusions An integrated IADL and ADL functional assessment tool is valuable.

We examine the role of multipartite entanglement in the FMO complex by direct computation of the convex roof optimization {{for a number of}} measures, including some that have not been previously evaluated. We also consider the role of monogamy of entanglement in these simulations. We utilize the fact that the monogamy bounds are saturated in the single exciton subspace. This enables us to compute more measures of entanglement exactly and also to validate the evaluation of the convex roof. We then use direct computation of the convex roof to evaluate measures that are not determined by monogamy. This approach provides a more complete account of the entanglement in these systems than has been available to date. Our results support the hypothesis that multipartite entanglement is maximum primary along the two distinct electronic energy transfer pathways. Comment: 37 pages, 19 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{anomalies}} in five-dimensional orbifold {{theories are}} examined in a generic type of non-factorizable geometries. In spite of complicated fermion wavefunctions, {{the shape of}} anomaly {{is found to be}} identical to that of flat theories. In particular it is split evenly on the orbifold fixed points. This result also follows from the arguments on the AdS/CFT correspondence and an anomaly cancellation mechanism. The cancellation with Chern-Simons term works if the four-dimensional effective theory is free from chiral anomalies. We also discuss the Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) term in warped supersymmetric theories. Unlike the gauge anomaly, FI divergences reside not only on the orbifold fixed points but also in the whole five-dimensional bulk. The effect of the FI term is to generate supersymmetric masses for charged hypermultiplets, which are no longer constant but have metric factor dependence.
