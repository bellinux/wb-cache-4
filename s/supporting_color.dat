50|$|One popular use of CompuServe in the 1980s was file exchange, {{particularly}} pictures. Indeed, in 1985 it hosted {{perhaps the}} first online comic in the world, Witches and Stitches. CompuServe introduced a simple black-and-white image format known as RLE (run-length-encoding) to standardize the images {{so they could be}} shared among different microcomputer platforms. With the introduction of more powerful machines, universally <b>supporting</b> <b>color,</b> CompuServe introduced the much more capable GIF format, invented by Steve Wilhite. GIF {{went on to become the}} de facto standard for 8-bit images on the Internet in the early and mid-1990s.|$|E

5000|$|Trapping {{towards a}} rich black (a black with a support screen of another color {{added to it}} {{to give it a}} ‘deeper’ look and making it more opaque - often called [...] "undercolor"), will follow the same rules as {{trapping}} to a ‘normal’ black. However, a stay-away should be created for the <b>supporting</b> <b>color</b> to prevent misregistration from revealing the undercolor {{at the edges of the}} rich black object. In short, a stay-away pushes the undercolor away from the edge of the rich black, and is usually created with a single color black stroke, set to [...] "knock-out".|$|E
5000|$|The Sorcerer instead chose {{another method}} entirely, {{which was to}} use definable {{character}} graphics. There were 256 characters possible for each screen location. The lower half was fixed in ROM, and contained the usual ASCII character set. The upper half was defined in RAM. This area would be loaded with a default set of graphics at reset, but could be re-defined and used in lieu of pixel-addressable graphics. In fact the machine was actually drawing a 64×30 display (8×8 characters) which was well within {{the capabilities of the}} hardware. However this meant that all graphics had to lie within a checkerboard pattern on the screen, and the system was generally less flexible than machines with [...] "real" [...] graphics. In addition, the high resolution was well beyond the capability of the average color TV, a problem they solved by not <b>supporting</b> <b>color.</b> In this respect the Sorcerer was similar to the PET and TRS-80 in that it had only [...] "graphics characters" [...] to draw with, but at least on the Sorcerer one could define a custom set. It was also possible to provide animation by character replacement or by redefining the character bitmap.|$|E

40|$|Cigarette {{packaging}} {{matters to}} consumer behavior. However, {{it is less}} clear which changes to packaging design would be salient for adult smokers. Such information is critically important to regulators in the United States who are charged with reviewing new tobacco products for their impact on population health. In this qualitative study, U. S. adult smokers (n = 33) participated in six telephone-based focus groups in March 2017. Separate groups were comprised of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) participants; participants with less than four years of post-secondary education; a mix of LGB and straight participants; and, the general population. All groups were purposely selected for diversity. Open thematic coding identified salient design elements used on cigarette packaging. Smokers articulated design elements’ use, meaning, and links with consumer behaviors. Three themes were identified: (1) the power of color, (2) <b>supporting</b> <b>color</b> with other design elements (e. g., logos/images, typography, the pack itself), and (3) the combined product brand experience of multiple design elements. Participants linked design elements to product characteristics and to consumer behavior (e. g., purchase). As the Food and Drug Administration is charged with regulating tobacco products, these findings suggest the importance of considering the cigarette pack part {{of the characteristics of}} a product...|$|E
40|$|Tese de dout., Psicologia, Faculdade de Ciências Humanas e Sociais, Univ. do Algarve, 2011 In this thesis, {{we present}} six studies that {{investigated}} {{the role of}} color information during visual object recognition. The interactions between surface color and color knowledge information were investigated in two studies (chapters 2 and 3). In chapters 4 and 5, we present data that identify the visual processing stage at which color information improves color and non-color diagnostic object recognition. In chapter 6, the neural pathways <b>supporting</b> <b>color</b> object recognition were investigated. Additionally, {{in an attempt to}} bring some consistency to the literature, we performed a systematic meta-analysis on the effects of color on object recognition in chapter 7. Chapter 2 and 3 provided data suggesting that surface color information is more influential than color knowledge information during object recognition. Chapter 4 and 5 showed that color information improves the recognition of color and non-color diagnostic objects at different stages of visual processing. Although color information is an important cue for both of these types of objects in the early visual processes, it is also important in later stages of visual processing for color diagnostic object recognition. In chapter 6, we observed that colored objects, when compared with black and white objects, activated a more extensive brain network related to visuo-semantic activation and retrieval. Finally, the meta-analysis in chapter 7 conclusively showed a significant effect of color information during object recognition. In summary, the general picture that emerges from this body of work is that color information takes part in object recognition processes at multiple levels of representation.

40|$|Accounting for the {{astonishing}} {{developments in the}} field of Extragalactic Astronomy and Cosmology, this second edition has been updated and substantially expanded. Starting with the description of our home galaxy, the Milky Way, this cogently written textbook introduces the reader to the astronomy of galaxies, their structure, active galactic nuclei, evolution and large scale distribution in the Universe. After an extensive and thorough introduction to modern observational and theoretical cosmology, the focus turns to the formation of structures and astronomical objects in the early Universe. The basics of classical astronomy and stellar astrophysics needed for extragalactic astronomy are provided in the appendix. The new edition incorporates some of the most spectacular results from new observatories like the Galaxy Evolution Explorer, Herschel, ALMA, WMAP and Planck, as well as new instruments and multi-wavelength campaigns which have expanded our understanding of the Universe and the objects populating it. This includes new views on the galaxy population in the nearby Universe, on elliptical galaxies, as well as a deeper view of the distant Universe approaching the dark ages, and an unprecedented view of the distant dusty Universe. Schneider also discusses the impressive support for the standard model of the Universe, which has been substantially strengthened by recent results, including baryon acoustic oscillations (an approach which has significantly matured over the years), results from the completed WMAP mission and from the first Planck results, which have confirmed and greatly improved on these findings, not least by measuring the gravitational lensing effect on the microwave background. Further, a new chapter focusing on galaxy evolution illustrates how well the observations of distant galaxies and their central supermassive black holes can be understood in a general framework of theoretical ideas, models, and numerical simulations. Peter Schneider’s Extragalactic Astronomy and Cosmology offers fundamental information on this fascinating subfield of astronomy, while leading readers to the forefront of astronomical research. But it seeks to accomplish this not only with extensive textual information and insights; the author’s own passion for exploring the workings of the Universe, which {{can be seen in the}} text and the many <b>supporting</b> <b>color</b> illustrations, will further inspire the reader. While this book has grown out of introductory university courses on astronomy and astrophysics and includes a set of problems and solutions, it will not only benefit undergraduate students and lecturers; thanks to the comprehensive coverage of the field, even graduate students and researchers specializing in related fields will appreciate it as a valuable reference work.
