5|$|Beechwood Theater, {{a replica}} of the Little Theater on Broadway, was {{included}} in Wells Bosworth's design of the primary school building because Vanderlip particularly wanted his own theater. Beechwood Theater, with 256 gold velvet seats, was designed by Winthrop Ames around 1917. Details were closely examined upon construction; the lighting equipment, the scene lofts and fly gallery, and the dressing rooms were well-designed and state-of-the-art. The <b>stage</b> <b>floor</b> was designed especially for dancing, and the acoustics and theater proportions made varieties of productions possible.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{movie was}} sketched out via {{hand-drawn}} storyboards and then re-created as computer-generated 3D animatics {{with all of}} the 2D background photographs digitally painted to resemble the 1939 setting. With the animatics as a guide, grids were created to map camera and actor movements with digital characters standing in for the real actors. The grids were made into actual maps on the blue screen <b>stage</b> <b>floor</b> to help the actors move around invisible scenery.|$|E
5|$|In the 2000 ceremony, a dove {{image was}} {{projected}} on an enormous white cloth {{held by the}} athletes on the stadium floor. In 2004, an LED screen was used. In 2006, acrobats formed {{the shape of a}} dove. The 2008 ceremony had fireworks representing doves. In 2010, dove figures were projected on the <b>stage</b> <b>floor.</b> The 2012 ceremony had bicyclists with dove-wings, lit by LEDs. In the 2014 ceremony several dancers, holding strands of blue LED lights, danced on the shape of a dove projected on the stadium floor. In the 2016 ceremony , children with dove shaped kites were seen running with the first Olympic Laurel winner, Kipchoge Keino.|$|E
50|$|The Bijou was razed to the {{orchestra}} and <b>stage</b> <b>floors,</b> {{which became the}} roof of the stores below. Most of what remained of the Bijou building was demolished in 2008, but Emerson College bought the property and plans to make the Bijou and Paramount Theatre into theatres and dormitories.|$|R
5000|$|... 1995 - A Capital Campaign was {{undertaken}} {{to fund a}} complete renovation of the Civic Auditorium {{as well as the}} construction of the SuzanneD. Parish Theatre. New electrical systems, rigging, <b>stage</b> <b>flooring,</b> and seating were installed in the auditorium as part of the renovation. Furnishings were reupholstered, and walls received a fresh coat of paint.|$|R
50|$|He started acting at {{an early}} age, {{beginning}} his tenure as a spear carrier rounding out productions at many New Orleans theaters. He mostly played small roles with stock companies, where he not only starred in traveling shows, but also worked at a movie theater, selling tickets and cleaning the <b>stage</b> <b>floors.</b> His family moved to Dallas, Texas, where he joined a repertory theater company under Margo Jones in 1938.|$|R
5|$|The fourth {{match was}} between The Undertaker and Muhammad Hassan (managed by Daivari). During Hassan's entrance, men in masks {{accompanied}} {{him to the}} ring to represent his Arabic culture. The masked men proceeded to interfered in the match, but Undertaker retaliated and removed all of the masked men from the ring. Midway through the match, Undertaker attempted to use a Tombstone piledriver on Hassan, but Hassan escaped the move and attempted a Clothesline. The Undertaker countered by chokeslamming Hassan and scored the pinfall on Hassan to win the match. Following this, Undertaker executed a Last Ride through the <b>stage</b> <b>floor</b> on Hassan, writing him out of storylines.|$|E
5|$|Notable {{changes were}} made to give the {{ceremony}} a sleek, interactive look while shortening {{the length of the}} ceremony. Cates announced that in certain categories, all five nominees would be up onstage prior to the announcement of the award. In other instances, the actor or actress would present the award in the audience. In addition, production designer Roy Christopher designed an technologically ambitious stage for the telecast that both saluted the past while look toward the future. The set prominently featured 26 high-definition video monitors floating over the first twelve rows of the audience and a 40-foot LED screen situated beneath a layer of plexiglass on the <b>stage</b> <b>floor.</b> Both screens were used display images of previous Oscar appearances as presenters took the stage or random film clips during several commercial breaks. A gold rod featuring 23 different life-sized Oscar statuettes spiraling upward was placed at center stage.|$|E
25|$|Tightrope: Four artists (two {{male and}} two female) would jump and dance across {{a series of}} tight ropes strung just above the <b>stage</b> <b>floor,</b> using peacock {{feathers}} as fans.|$|E
50|$|Doris Cole {{was born}} in the Bronx to a magician father who ran a magic store. She grew up in Manhattan and Brookline, Massachusetts, and started in theater by {{sweeping}} <b>stage</b> <b>floors</b> and acting in summer stock performances. In 1945, while still in her teens, she became the producer of Blue Holiday, an all-black Broadway variety show that ran for eight performances at the Belasco Theater, starring Katherine Dunham, Ethel Waters and Josh White.|$|R
5000|$|Arden studied {{dancing with}} Robert Alton, {{who later became}} a Broadway director. Arden decided he was better suited to {{organize}} and direct dance shows rather than perform in them. Arden got his first break in Cleveland, where he <b>staged</b> <b>floor</b> shows in clubs operated by racketeer Moe Dalitz. [...] "My success was due to…I hate {{to use the word}} 'mafia'," [...] Arden once said. [...] "Moe was a great guy to work for. He believed in spending money." ...|$|R
5000|$|The first indoor theatres {{were created}} in French tennis courts and Italian Renaissance palaces where the newly embraced {{principles}} of perspective allowed designers to create stunning vistas with buildings and trees decreasing in size toward a [...] "vanishing point" [...] on the horizon. <b>Stage</b> <b>floors</b> were raked upward slightly {{from front to back}} in order to contribute to the perspective illusion and also to make actors more visible to audiences, who were seated on level floors. Subsequently, audience seating was raked, and balconies were added to give audiences a fuller view. By the end of the 19th century most <b>stages</b> had level <b>floors,</b> and much of the audience looked down on, rather than up to, the stage.|$|R
25|$|Sometimes, petals {{would become}} loose and {{fall to the}} <b>stage</b> <b>floor.</b> Nijinsky's servant Vasili would collect the petals and sell them as souvenirs. It was said that he built a large house called Le Château du Spectre de la Rose with the profits {{from the sale of}} the petals.|$|E
25|$|The Westport Country Playhouse has a {{counterweight}} fly system currently employing 22 battens, {{with space}} for future installations. The height {{from the stage}} to the grid is 40 feet (12.19m), with an effective fly range from 3 feet 10inches (1.17m) to 38 feet (11.58m). Each arbor is 6 feet tall with a capacity for 1200 pounds (544kg). The locking rail is on the stage right wall, and the loading bridge is 32 feet 3inches (9.83m) above the <b>stage</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
25|$|A wagon brake has {{a handle}} which, when pushed down, extends a steel rod down {{and onto the}} stage. When fully extended, the steel rod {{actually}} lifts {{a section of the}} wagon slightly off the <b>stage</b> <b>floor.</b> The bottom end of the rod has a threaded cavity that will accept an extension spindle, which in turn can be used to adjust the height of the wagon above the stage. The brake is released by raising its handle, thereby retracting the steel rod away from the stage.|$|E
5000|$|Miller was {{famed for}} her speed in tap dance. Studio publicists concocted press {{releases}} claiming she could tap 500 times per minute, but in truth, {{the sound of}} ultra-fast [...] "500" [...] taps was looped in later. Because the <b>stage</b> <b>floors</b> were waxed and too slick for regular tap shoes, she had to dance in shoes with rubber treads on the sole. Later she would loop {{the sound of the}} taps while watching the film and actually dancing on a [...] "tap board" [...] to match her steps in the film.|$|R
50|$|The venue was {{relatively}} small, holding about 450 people. The <b>stage</b> and <b>floors</b> were wooden. The intimate setting allowed for good acoustics, different from popular arena-style venues at the time. Banks constructed {{the stage and}} balcony.|$|R
5000|$|In 1972, she {{purchased}} {{an historic}} theatre (Colonial Theatre, built in 1905) across from Lincoln Center and renamed it The Harkness Theater. The theatre was completely remodeled with state-of-the-art dance <b>stage</b> <b>flooring</b> and Spanish artist Enrique Senis-Oliver painted ceiling murals, opening with a season {{by the company}} in 1974. The company disbanded within the next year. The vitality of the dancers was widely admired {{and many of the}} ballets were very erotic, including the homoerotic [...] "Sebastian" [...] (1963) to music of Gian-Carlo Menotti, [...] "Monument for a Dead Boy" [...] (1966) by Rudi Van Dantzig (b. 1933) and [...] "Gemini" [...] (1972) by Vincente Nebrada (b. 1930).|$|R
25|$|Hinged foot irons may be {{bolted to}} the sides of the wagon. To lock the wagon in place, the free ends of the foot iron hinges are folded down and then secured to the stage with stage screws. This is a {{reliable}} method for immobilizing wagons, but it creates holes in the stage and can slow the process of locking and unlocking a wagon. Also, if a foot iron is allowed to contact the stage while the wagon is being moved, the <b>stage</b> <b>floor</b> can be damaged.|$|E
25|$|The stage {{design was}} created by Aigars Ozoliņš {{and based on the}} concept called Planet Latvia. The stage used several light and video effects and {{included}} an innovation new to the contest - a video screen <b>stage</b> <b>floor</b> {{that could be used to}} give each entry a unique look. The green room where the delegations and competitors awaited the results of the contest was placed directly behind the stage and unveiled shortly before the voting portion of the show commenced, allowing the audience to view the representatives of the competing nations as they received points.|$|E
25|$|Berlin {{is home to}} 44 {{theaters and}} stages. The Deutsches Theater in Mitte was built in 1849–50 and has {{operated}} almost continuously since then. The Volksbühne at Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz was built in 1913–14, though the company had been founded in 1890. The Berliner Ensemble, famous for performing the works of Bertolt Brecht, was established in 1949. The Schaubühne was founded in 1962 {{and moved to the}} building of the former Universum Cinema on Kurfürstendamm in 1981. With a seating capacity of 1,895 and a <b>stage</b> <b>floor</b> of , the Friedrichstadt-Palast in Berlin Mitte is the largest show palace in Europe.|$|E
5000|$|Gym: {{including}} a basketball court, several storerooms, two simple <b>stages</b> on 2 <b>floors</b> each.|$|R
50|$|MityLite, Inc. is an American {{manufacturer}} of tables, chairs, portable dance <b>floors,</b> <b>staging,</b> and partitions.|$|R

25|$|In 2006, due {{to years}} of wear and tear, the {{original}} concert <b>stage</b> <b>floor</b> was replaced {{at a cost of}} $250,000. In order to avoid any change {{to the sound of the}} hall, the new floor was built using same methods and materials as the original. These included tongue-in-groove, three-quarter inch, hard maple boards, a compressed wool underlayment and hardened steel cut nails, hammered in by hand. The vertical grain fir subfloor from 1899 was in excellent shape and was left in place. The nails used in the new floor were hand cut using the same size and construction as the originals and the back channelling on the original maple top boards was replicated as well.|$|E
25|$|In {{designing}} the Jedi Master Yoda, Stuart Freeborn used {{his own face}} as a model and added the wrinkles of Albert Einstein for the appearance of exceptional intelligence. Sets for Dagobah were built five feet above the <b>stage</b> <b>floor,</b> allowing puppeteers to crawl underneath and hold up the Yoda puppet. The setup presented communication problems for Frank Oz, who portrayed Yoda, as he was underneath the stage and unable to hear the crew and Mark Hamill above. Hamill later expressed his dismay at being the only human character on set for months; {{he felt like a}} trivial element on a set of animals, machines, and moving props. Kershner commended Hamill for his performance with the puppet.|$|E
25|$|The Chelsea {{version was}} marked by a unique {{production}} style. Eugene Lee helped Prince {{make sure that the}} multi-scene show would not get bogged down in set changes - he created platforms for the action that allowed scenes to change by refocusing attention instead of changing scenery. Actors performed on platforms in front, behind, and sometimes between audience members. Some sat on bleachers, others on stools on the <b>stage</b> <b>floor.</b> As the story unfolded, so did the stage, with sections falling from above, opening, closing, flying apart or coming together. A 13-member orchestra played from four areas. The conductor, who wore period costume and gold braid, could be seen by audience and musicians alike on television monitors.|$|E
50|$|The Robson Valley Community Centre {{is located}} in McBride. This centre has a <b>stage,</b> dance <b>floor</b> and {{commercial}} kitchen. The Robson Valley Community Centre is an ideal place to rent for theatre performances, conferences, wedding receptions, tradeshows or a family reunion.|$|R

2500|$|Armstrong {{started to}} work at Connie's Inn in Harlem, chief rival to the Cotton Club, a venue for elaborately <b>staged</b> <b>floor</b> shows, and a front for gangster Dutch Schultz. Armstrong also had {{considerable}} success with vocal recordings, including versions of famous songs composed by his old friend Hoagy Carmichael. His 1930s recordings took {{full advantage of the}} new RCA ribbon microphone, introduced in 1931, which imparted a characteristic warmth to vocals and immediately became an intrinsic part of the 'crooning' sound of artists like Bing Crosby. Armstrong's famous interpretation of Carmichael's [...] "Stardust" [...] {{became one of the most}} successful versions of this song ever recorded, showcasing Armstrong's unique vocal sound and style and his innovative approach to singing songs that had already become standards.|$|R
25|$|These {{buildings}} were semi-circular and possessed certain inherent architectural structures, with minor differences {{depending on the}} region {{in which they were}} constructed. The scaenae frons was a high back wall of the <b>stage</b> <b>floor,</b> supported by columns. The proscaenium was a wall that supported the front edge of the stage with ornately decorated niches off to the sides. The Hellenistic influence is seen through the use of the proscaenium. The Roman theatre also had a podium, which sometimes supported the columns of the scaenae frons. The scaenae was originally not part of the building itself, constructed only to provide sufficient background for the actors. Eventually, it became a part of the edifice itself, made out of concrete. The theatre itself was divided into the stage (orchestra) and the seating section (auditorium). Vomitoria or entrances and exits were made available to the audience.|$|E
500|$|In the [...] "Opening Sequence", {{after the}} RKO logo appears, Astaire, shown {{only from the}} waist down, dances onto a {{polished}} <b>stage</b> <b>floor,</b> backed by a male chorus sporting canes. On pausing his name appears. Rogers then follows suit and the two dance together as the picture dissolves to reveal a top hat. A similar concept {{was used in the}} opening sequence of The Barkleys of Broadway (1949).|$|E
500|$|In her {{performance}} it's always {{clear that a}} finely tuned engine is at work, but what was refreshing here {{was that it was}} in service of a surprisingly casual manner. She made funny, exaggerated faces; twirled her hair (when it was not floating); and spoke to the crowd like a knowing buddy. She was working off a teleprompter for her between-song patter, but improvising frequently, and for the better ... Beyoncé persevere, with a voice that skips up octaves and still gains power, with words that are as compelling as they are straightforward, with legs that treat the <b>stage</b> <b>floor</b> like an enemy in need of a thorough stomping. Even in moments of uncertainty, these are her constants. They survive her missteps.|$|E
5000|$|Saki {{ended the}} year by {{competing}} in the sixteen-man 2012 Glory Heavyweight Grand Slam at Glory 4: Tokyo - 2012 Heavyweight Grand Slam in Saitama, Japan on December 31, 2012. Saki defeated Raoumaru with ease at the opening <b>stage,</b> <b>flooring</b> the out-matched Korean twice in round one and forcing the referee to stop the bout. Then, in the quarter-finals, he knocked out Anderson [...] "Braddock" [...] Silva with his patented left hook in the closing seconds of round one. Advancing to the semis, Saki was eliminated by the eventual tournament winner, Semmy Schilt. Dwarfed by eleven inches and outweighed by twenty seven kilograms, Saki's high work rate {{was not enough to}} outpoint Schilt and he lost on points after the judges awarded the giant Dutchman the first two rounds.|$|R
