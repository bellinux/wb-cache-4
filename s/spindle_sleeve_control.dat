40|$|Choke valves {{are widely}} used in the oil&gas {{industry}} to control the fluid flowing in the system. Some of these valves rely on a "cage and sleeve" functioning, in which an outer, sliding <b>sleeve</b> <b>controls</b> the flow rate by overlapping the holes of an inner, fixed cage. The regulation characteristic of choke valves is typically quantified by the opening curve, which is {{the plot of the}} flow coefficient versus the valve opening. Experimental tests performed on a ???cage and sleeve??? choke valve revealed that the orientation of the holes of the cage affects significantly the flow coefficient. This work focuses on the worst situation encountered, in which an anomalous decreasing trend in the opening curve for large valve openings is accompanied by strong vibrations of the device. CFD simulations were run to provide a physical interpretation of this unexpected result. Due to the complexity of the flow field structure at the origin of this behavior particular attention was paid in properly defining the CFD model; the turbulence model and the differencing scheme for the convective fluxes were found to be the most significant parameters. The CFD runs allowed attributing the anomalous trend of the opening curve to the peculiar interactions of the jets within the cage. At last, a modification of the trim design is suggested for avoiding the malfunctioning of the valve and the abnormal vibrations...|$|R

40|$|A {{sleeve valve}} is under {{development}} for ground-based forced response testing of air compression systems. This valve {{will be used}} to inject air and to impart momentum to the flow inside the first stage of a multi-stage compressor. The valve was designed to deliver a maximum mass flow of 0. 22 lbm/s (0. 1 kg/s) with a maximum valve throat area of 0. 12 sq. in (80 sq. mm), a 100 psid (689 KPA) pressure difference across the valve and a 68 F, (20 C) air supply. It was assumed that the valve mass flow rate would be proportional to the valve orifice area. A static flow calibration revealed a nonlinear valve orifice area to mass flow relationship which limits the maximum flow rate that the valve can deliver. This nonlinearity was found to be caused by multiple choking points in the flow path. A simple model was used to explain this nonlinearity and the model was compared to the static flow calibration data. Only steady flow data is presented here.

40|$|Previous {{investigations}} {{have shown that}} prickle discomfort sensations of wool fabrics are primarily determined by the mean fiber diameter of the wool. It is also known that differences in wool fiber curvature (crimp) affect softness of handle of greasy wool and of wool textiles. In a replicated experiment, we investigated if wearers could detect the effect of using 17 µm superfine wool of low (74 °/mm) or high (114 °/mm) fiber curvature, and when the wools were blended with 17 µm cashmere (fiber curvature 49 °/mm) in differing proportions, on four comfort sensations. Eight single jersey knitted fabrics were assessed under a controlled protocol using forearm sleeves made of the test fabric and a control fabric. Data (37 sensorial assessments of high curvature wool fabrics; 38 sensorial assessments of low curvature wool fabrics) were analyzed using linear mixed model analysis (restricted maximum likelihood), which included fixed effects for wool type and blend ratio and a random effect for participant. The use of a <b>control</b> <b>sleeve</b> fabric reduced variance due to participant effects by providing an anchor for each sensation over time. Wool fiber curvature affected participant assessment of breathability, comfort, feel after exercise (damp/dry) and skin feel (prickly/soft), with preferred values associated with high curvature (crimp) superfine wool.

40|$|The {{relationships}} were investigated between the prickle discomfort scores, assessed by human response from wearer trial garment assessment, and sleeve trial, Wool ComfortMeter (WCM) and Wool HandleMeter (WHM) assessments of fabrics, and fiber diameter characteristics including mean fiber diameter (MFD). Sleeve trial assessment followed exercise, {{the use of}} a <b>control</b> <b>sleeve</b> to reduce participant variance and four sensory traits. WHM provides eight handle parameters calibrated against a panel of experts. Four scenarios were evaluated: sleeve trial assessment with MFD; sleeve trial assessment with MFD and WCM; sleeve trial assessment with MFD, WCM and WHM parameters; and sleeve trial assessment with WCM and WHM parameters. Data were analyzed using correlation and forward stepwise general linear modeling. There was no evidence that the incidence of fibers coarser than 30 µm aided the prediction of prickle discomfort once MFD had been accounted for in the models. There were significant correlations between the WCM measurement and each sleeve trial attribute. There was no significant correlation between WHM parameters and sleeve trial assessments. The sleeve trial attribute of ‘skin feel’ offers potential to improve the predictions made of wearer trial prickle discomfort when used in association of the WCM with or without data on fabric MFD. There was little evidence to support using WHM parameters with or without the WCM in predicting wearer assessed prickle discomfort of fabrics. These results indicate that the rapid evaluation of fabrics using sleeve trial assessment can provide cost effective ranking of consumer preferences...|$|R

We examined the effect of 2 -weeks elevation of retrograde SR on brachial artery endothelial function in young and in older men. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirteen healthy young (23 +/- 2 years) and 13 older men (61 +/- 5 years) were instructed to continuously wear a compression sleeve around the right forearm to chronically (2 weeks) elevate brachial artery retrograde SR in 1 arm. We assessed SR, diameter, and flow-mediated dilation in both the <b>sleeve</b> and contralateral <b>control</b> arms at baseline and after 30 minutes and 2 weeks of continuous sleeve application. The sleeve intervention increased retrograde SR after 30 minutes and 2 weeks in both young and older men (P= 0. 03 and 0. 001, respectively). In young men, brachial artery flow-mediated dilation % was lower after 30 minutes and 2 weeks (P= 0. 004), while resting artery diameter was reduced after 2 weeks (P= 0. 005). The contralateral arm showed no change in retrograde SR or flow-mediated dilation % (P= 0. 32 and 0. 26, respectively), but a decrease in diameter (P= 0. 035).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{details the}} theoretical development, design, fabrication, {{and testing of}} two remote sensing antennas. The antennas operate in Ku and Ka bands and must support multiple beams, polarizations, and frequencies with a single aperture. ^ The first antenna, developed for NASA 2 ̆ 7 s High-Altitude Imaging Wind and Rain Airborne Profiler, is a single, offset-fed reflector that supports dual-band beams incident at 30 ° and 40 ° off-nadir. The antenna uses two compact, dual-band feeds {{moved away from the}} reflector 2 ̆ 7 s focal point to meet the dual beam requirement. The radar is to be flown on the Global Hawk Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle which has a small payload bay requiring the feeds to be both rugged and compact. ^ The second antenna, developed for Remote Sensing Solutions 2 ̆ 7 Dual-Wavelength Precipitation Radar, is a dual-offset Gregorian reflector. The antenna supports a single, dual-band, beam with dual-polarization at each band. Additionally, the antenna has high polarization purity and matched half power beamwidths at Ku and Ka bands. The strict requirements of the antenna are met by precisely controlling feed radiation characteristics. ^ The two antennas necessitated several advances in feed design. A foam sleeve is demonstrated as an effective method to reduce the beamwidth of a tapered dielectric rod antenna. The foam sleeve is an attractive design because it allows dual-band feeds where a corrugated horn is used to control radiation at lower frequencies and the sleeve corrected rod is used to control the upper band. By judiciously choosing <b>sleeve</b> material, independent <b>control</b> of the radiation pattern and phase center at each band is achieved allowing higher performance feeds. This dissertation also focuses on new developments in the backend design of feeds. Specifically, the use of tuning arms in the feed backend and double ridged waveguide to couple the signal into the feed allow more compact designs with greater bandwidth. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether calf compression sleeves (CS) affects physiological and biomechanical parameters, exercise performance, and perceived sensations of muscle fatigue, pain and soreness during prolonged (~ 2 h 30 min) outdoor trail running. Methods: Fourteen healthy trained males took part in a randomized, cross-over study consisting in two identical 24 -km trail running sessions (each including one bout of running at constant rate on moderately flat terrain, and one period of all-out running on hilly terrain) wearing either degressive CS (23 ± 2 mmHg) or <b>control</b> <b>sleeves</b> (CON, & 4 mmHg). Running time, heart rate and muscle oxygenation of the medial gastrocnemius muscle (measured using portable near-infrared spectroscopy) were monitored continuously. Muscle functional capabilities (power, stiffness) were determined using 20 s of maximal hopping before and after both sessions. Running biomechanics (kinematics, vertical and leg stiffness) were determined at 12 km·h− 1 at the beginning, during, and at the end of both sessions. Exercise-induced Achilles tendon pain and delayed onset calf muscles soreness (DOMS) were assessed using visual analog scales. Results: Muscle oxygenation increased significantly in CS compared to CON at baseline and immediately after exercise (p & 0. 05), without any difference in deoxygenation kinetics during the run, and without any significant change in run times. Wearing CS was associated with (i) higher aerial time and leg stiffness in running at constant rate, (ii) with lower ground contact time, higher leg stiffness, and higher vertical stiffness in all-out running, and (iii) with lower ground contact time in hopping. Significant DOMS were induced in both CS and CON (> 6 on a 10 -cm scale) with no difference between conditions. However, Achilles tendon pain was significantly lower after the trial in CS than CON (p & 0. 05). Discussion: Calf compression did not modify muscle oxygenation during ~ 2 h 30 of trail running but significantly changed running biomechanics and lower limb muscle functional capabilities toward a more dynamic behavior compared to control session. However, wearing compression sleeves did not affect performance and exercise-induced DOMS, while it minimized Achilles tendon pain immediately after running...|$|R

Bariatric surgery is an efficient procedure for controlling T 2 DM in morbidly obese patients. in T 2 DM, the incretin effect is either greatly impaired or absent. This study aimed to evaluate the preliminary results from interposing a segment of ileum into the proximal jejunum associated with a sleeve or diverted <b>sleeve</b> gastrectomy to <b>control</b> T 2 DM in patients with a body mass index (BMI) less than 35 kg/m(2). Methods for this study, 39 patients (16 women and 23 men) underwent two laparoscopic procedures comprising different combinations of ileal interposition into the proximal jejunum via a sleeve or diverted sleeve gastrectomy. {{the mean age of}} these patients was 50. 3 years (range, 36 - 66 years). the mean BMI was 30. 1 kg/m(2) (range, 23. 4 - 34. 9 kg/m(2)). All the patients had a diagnosis of T 2 DM that had persisted for at least 3 years and evidence of stable treatment with oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin for at least 12 months. the mean duration of T 2 DM was 9. 3 years (range, 3 - 22 years). Results the mean operative time was 185 min, and the median hospital stay was 4. 3 days. Four major complications occurred in the short term (30 -days), and the mortality rate was 2. 6 %. the mean postoperative follow-up period was 7 months (range, 4 - 16 months), and the mean percentage of weight loss was 22 %. the mean postoperative BMI was 24. 9 kg/m(2) (range, 18. 9 - 31. 7 kg/m 2). An adequate glycemic control was achieved for 86. 9 % of the patients, and 13. 1 % had important improvement. the patients whose glycemia was not normalized were using a single oral hypoglycemic agent. No patient needed insulin therapy postoperatively. All the patients except experienced normalization of their cholesterol levels. Targeted triglycerides levels were achieved by 71 % of the patients, and hypertension was controlled for 95. 8 %. Conclusions the laparoscopic ileal interposition via either a sleeve gastrectomy or diverted sleeve gastrectomy seems to be a promising procedure for the control of T 2 DM and the metabolic syndrome.

40|$|Lightweight alloy {{materials}} such as magnesium and aluminum alloys are frequently employed in the automotive and manufacturing industry {{in order to improve}} vehicle fuel economy. This creates a pressing need for joining of these materials to each other, as well as to steels. Given the drastic difference in thermal and mechanical properties of these materials and the limited solubility of aluminum or magnesium in steel, dissimilar alloy fusion welding is exceptionally difficult. Refill friction stir spot welding (RFSSW) is a solid-state joining technology which connects two materials together with minimal heat input or distortion. The RFSSW process involves a three-piece non-consumable tool with independently <b>controlled</b> <b>sleeve</b> and pin components, which rotate simultaneously at a constant speed with the sleeve penetrating into only the top sheet. Joining of Al 5754 alloy and DP 600 plate using friction stir seam welding is investigated. Two travel speeds of the shoulder are used to compare the mechanical and microstructural properties of the two kinds of welds made. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical microscopy are utilized to characterize the microstructure. Mechanical properties are evaluated using tensile testing. Joining of Al 6063 -T 6 and Zn coated DP 600 steel using RFSSW is studied. Spot welds could reach a maximum overlap shear load of 3. 7 kN when using a tool speed of 2100 RPM, a 2. 5 s welding time and 1. 1 mm of penetration into the upper Al 6063 sheet. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were conducted to characterize the interface, which revealed that zinc layer was displaced into the interface and upper sheet, which may facilitate the bonding between the two sheets. Microhardness measurements reveal that the fracture path propagates through the soft heat affected zone of the Al alloy during overlap shear testing. Joining of Mg alloys ZEK with Zn coated DP 600 steel sheets by RFSSW is also studied here. In joints between ZEK 100 and DP 600, the maximum overlap shear fracture load is 4. 7 kN, when a 1800 RPM tool speed, 3. 0 s welding time and 1. 5 mm penetration into the upper ZEK 100 sheet is applied. SEM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that a continuous layer of FeAl 2 particles accommodate bonding of the ZEK 100 and DP 600 sheets, which appears to have originated from the galvanized coating on the DP 600. If the zinc layer is removed then the maximum overlap shear fracture load is 3. 1 kN. X-ray diffraction analysis of the interface between the Mg alloy and the DP 600 steel on the Mg side also revealed that intermetallic (IMCs) such as FeAl 2 existed as an interfacial layer between the two sheets. It can be revealed from the displacement curve that the absorbed energy of the weld made under the condition of 1800 RPM, 3. 5 s, and 1. 5 mm of plunge depth in tensile testing up to failure point is approximately 2. 73 J...|$|R
