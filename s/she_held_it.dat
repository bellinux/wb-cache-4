25|$|Williams began 2002 {{by winning}} the Mondial Australian Women's Hardcourts in Gold Coast, Australia, {{defeating}} Henin in the final. However, she then lost {{for the first time}} in her career to Seles in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open. Williams then went on to win the Open Gaz de France in Paris when Jelena DokiÄ‡ withdrew from the final, and the Proximus Diamond Games in Antwerp, Belgium, defeating Henin in the final. As a result of her strong start to the season, Williams assumed the World No. 1 position for the first time on February 25, dislodging Capriati. Williams was the first African-American woman ever to hold the ranking. <b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> for just three weeks before surrendering it back to Capriati.|$|E
25|$|Sharapova was the {{top seed}} at the Australian Open due to top-ranked Justine Henin's withdrawal. After being two points away from defeat {{in the first round}} against Camille Pin, she went on to reach the final of the tournament for the first time, but was routed there by Serena Williams who was ranked world No. 81 at the time. After {{reaching}} the final, Sharapova recaptured the world No. 1 ranking. <b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> for seven weeks, surrendering it back to Henin after failing to defend her title at the Pacific Life Open, instead losing in the fourth round to Vera Zvonareva after struggling with a hamstring injury. The following fortnight, she defeated Venus Williams in the third round of the Sony Ericsson Open, before being beaten again by Serena Williams.|$|E
25|$|Under her {{editorial}} management {{it proved}} the swiftest journalistic success on record, numbering its subscribers by the hundred thousand, and while other papers took {{a loss for}} granted in the beginning, putting itself upon a paying basis at the outset. While she had assistants in every department, among their names those of some most distinguished in our literature, she was herself the inspiration of the whole corps, and under the advice and suggestion of its proprietors <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> on an even course. There was scarcely a poet, or a story-writer, or novelist of any rank in America or England {{who is not a}} contributor to its pages, and its purity, its self-respect, its high standard, and its literary excellence, were unrivalled among periodical publications. The influence of such a paper within American homes was something hardly to be computed. It was always on the side of good and sweet things; it made the right seem the best and pleasantest; it taught while it has amused; it held the happiness, well-being, and virtue of women and the family as its first consideration, and it created a wholesome atmosphere wherever it was constantly read. Through its columns, its editor made her hand felt in countless families for nearly 16 years, and helped to shape the domestic ends of a generation to peace and righteousness.|$|E
60|$|This time, when Madeline {{caught his}} arm <b>she</b> <b>held</b> to <b>it,</b> {{even after he}} stopped.|$|R
60|$|Barbara Heathcote had a temper, {{and though}} <b>she</b> usually <b>held</b> <b>it</b> in check it swept her away just then.|$|R
6000|$|To {{her great}} {{surprise}} the flower nodded at her, {{and then a}} faint, sweet voice said, as <b>she</b> still <b>held</b> <b>it</b> close to her face,-- ...|$|R
2500|$|Next, King {{considered}} {{whether the}} ordinance was vague {{in all its}} possible applications. <b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> significant that the guidelines had been drawn up by the city in response to business concerns, giving it a point of similarity with the Hoffman Estates ordinance and the Court's holding {{that the ability to}} clarify justified a less strict vagueness standard. But [...] "to be safe", she wrote, the court was applying the stricter standards for criminal ordinances.|$|E
60|$|Then, {{lifting the}} gourd from her head, <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> out to me.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> {{out before}} him. He glanced {{at it and}} back into her face.|$|E
60|$|He bowed {{over the}} hand which <b>she</b> <b>held</b> half-shyly out. <b>It</b> {{was not a}} form of {{greeting}} in which she often indulged.|$|R
50|$|In 1963, Sue was {{enrolled}} at Highland Park High School. Shortly after she turned 15, Pitt {{set a new}} world record in the 200-meter butterfly (long course) of 2:29.1 on July 27, 1963, which <b>she</b> <b>held</b> until <b>it</b> was eclipsed by Sharon Stouder in 1964.|$|R
60|$|Not a word, not a movement, escaped Mrs. Rook. <b>She</b> <b>held</b> the locket {{before her}} as <b>she</b> had <b>held</b> <b>it</b> from the first. Alban looked at Emily. Her eyes were riveted on the housekeeper: she was barely capable of {{preserving}} the appearance of composure. Seeing the necessity of acting for her, he at once said the words which {{she was unable to}} say for herself.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> {{out without}} a word. She {{had been holding}} it in her hand.|$|E
60|$|I {{gave it to}} her, and <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> {{against the}} sky by the naked blade.|$|E
60|$|I {{took out}} a card. <b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> without glancing at it, and invited me in.|$|E
50|$|This was {{the first}} time that the Liberal-Democrats won a seat in the St Margarets ward. Inga Lockington gained one of the ward's 3 seats from the Conservatives. <b>She</b> has <b>held</b> <b>it</b> ever since. The ward had been solidly Conservative for a century.|$|R
50|$|With Lemay {{completely}} {{gone from}} AW, Swajeski became head writer, a position <b>she</b> <b>held</b> until 1992. <b>It</b> {{has been argued}} that much of her critically acclaimed storylines came from Lemays storyline projections.|$|R
60|$|He took it {{from the}} table towards which <b>she</b> pointed, and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> under the lamplight. Presently he called to her. His {{forefinger}} rested upon a certain column.|$|R
60|$|She {{took out}} a piece of folded silk, and Miss Schuyler noticed the fashion in which <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
60|$|Wonderful. <b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> to her own. And {{through the}} sifted light pale gold in {{contrast}} glided. To hear.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Pegler's cup, {{rattling}} {{against her}} saucer as <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>it,</b> denoted some nervousness on her part. 'No,' she said. 'Not now, not now.' ...|$|E
6000|$|As {{she stood}} {{with the letter}} in her hand, every nerve tingling, every vein throbbing, and every muscle as rigid {{as if it had}} been cast in metal, she could {{scarcely}} comprehend that it had really come--that <b>she</b> really <b>held</b> <b>it.</b> After all this waiting and hoping and trusting, here was news from Captain Horn--news by his own hand, now, here, this minute! ...|$|R
50|$|His widow, Dona, {{endorsed}} Penny Priddy as Cadman's successor in the 2006 federal election. Priddy, {{a longtime}} {{member of the}} New Democratic Party, had been friendly with the Cadmans for many years despite their sharp political differences. Dona Cadman subsequently reconciled with the Conservatives and was elected to her husband's seat in 2008. <b>She</b> only <b>held</b> <b>it</b> for one term before it fell to the NDP in 2011.|$|R
50|$|His mother, Sarah, {{was first}} elected to the Winnipeg School Board as the school trustee for Ward 3 in 1925. Orlikow's cousin, Mindel Cherniak Sheps, succeeded her in the seat when <b>she</b> retired, and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> until 1950 when her brother, Saul Cherniak, was elected.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> up in {{the light}} of the {{carriage}} lamp, and the most dreadful expression of grief and of horror contorted her face.|$|E
60|$|Statira {{had slipped}} {{her hand into}} Lemuel's, and <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> fast, as if in that clasp she were holding on to her chance of life.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold {{out your}} hand, dear," [...] he said, and when <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> out {{he placed the}} ring on her finger. Then he took her in his arms.|$|E
60|$|Her words feebly {{expressed}} {{the sense of}} deliverance which overflowed her heart. Her strength failed her {{like that of a}} person suddenly relieved from some great physical stress or peril; but she felt that he had given her the truth, and <b>she</b> <b>held</b> fast by <b>it</b> while she went on.|$|R
500|$|In Krimstock v. Kelly (2002), Sotomayor {{wrote an}} opinion halting New York City's {{practice}} of seizing the motor vehicles of drivers accused of driving while intoxicated {{and some other}} crimes and holding those vehicles for [...] "months or even years" [...] during criminal proceedings. Noting the importance of cars to many individuals' livelihoods or daily activities, <b>she</b> <b>held</b> that <b>it</b> violated individuals' due process rights to hold the vehicles without permitting the owners to challenge the City's continued possession of their property.|$|R
60|$|Dorothea when {{thoroughly}} moved cared little {{what any}} one {{thought of her}} feelings; and {{even if she had}} been able to reflect, <b>she</b> would have <b>held</b> <b>it</b> petty to keep silence at injurious words about Will from fear of being herself misunderstood. Her face was flushed and her lip trembled.|$|R
60|$|She {{lifted the}} {{beautiful}} goblet from the table, {{put it to}} her lips, and drank a deep draught from it; then, smiling mockingly, <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> towards him.|$|E
60|$|She {{opened her}} bed-gown at the throat, and {{drew up a}} loop of ribbon over her head. 'The pocketbook was {{attached}} to the ribbon. <b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> out.|$|E
60|$|Watching her opportunity, Fanny Mere came to {{me while}} I was alone, {{carrying}} a thick letter in her hand. <b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> before me with the address uppermost.|$|E
6000|$|For a {{few weeks}} Christie's illusions lasted; then she {{discovered}} that the new life was nearly as humdrum as the old, that her companions were ordinary men and women, and her bright hopes were growing as dim as her tarnished shield. She grew unutterably weary of [...] "The Castle of the Sun," [...] and found the [...] "Demon's Daughter" [...] an unmitigated bore. She was not tired of the profession, only dissatisfied with the place <b>she</b> <b>held</b> in <b>it,</b> and eager to attempt a part that gave some scope for power and passion.|$|R
6000|$|She {{abruptly}} quitted her hold of him, and fronted {{the whole}} court in an instant. The railing {{in front of}} her shook with the quivering of her arms and hands as <b>she</b> <b>held</b> by <b>it</b> to support herself! Her hair lay tangled on her shoulders; her face had assumed a strange fixedness; her gentle blue eyes, so soft and tender at all other times, were lit up wildly. A low hum of murmured curiosity and admiration broke from the women of the audience. Some rose eagerly from the benches; others cried: ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{it was not}} her {{business}} to think for me, or to seek a place for me: besides, in her eyes, how doubtful must have appeared my character, position, tale. She shook her head, she [...] "was sorry she could give me no information," [...] and the white door closed, quite gently and civilly: but it shut me out. If <b>she</b> had <b>held</b> <b>it</b> open a little longer, I believe I should have begged a piece of bread; for I was now brought low.|$|R
