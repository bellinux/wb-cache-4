5|$|The pass {{is above}} tree line, so the {{surrounding}} terrain is alpine tundra. Open grassy expanses are occasionally broken by low shrubbery and bare patches of rock, {{particularly on the}} <b>steep</b> <b>slope</b> to the north. Snow lingers in some areas year-round. Adjacent to the road and parking area are small ephemeral pools on the southwest, with a larger, permanent one north of the road.|$|E
5|$|To {{the north}} of Edinburgh lay the marshy Nor Loch, formed in the early 15th century in the {{depression}} where Princes Street Gardens are now laid out. This natural defence was augmented by the <b>steep</b> <b>slope</b> up to {{the northern edge of}} the Old Town. Edinburgh Castle, on its rocky outcrop, defended the western approach. Walls were therefore needed primarily on the south and east sides of the burgh.|$|E
5|$|At {{the base}} of the first drop, the train banks a few degrees to the right and climbs the first air-time hill and descends. Following this, the train climbs up to a hairpin 180-degree hammerhead turn to the left. The train descends from the height of the turn to travel up and over three more air-time hills. After the hills, the train climbs up a <b>steep</b> <b>slope</b> into the mid-course brake run.|$|E
40|$|Shoaling {{characteristics}} of waves on <b>steep</b> <b>slopes</b> are unique due to significant reflections. Wave heights on <b>steep</b> <b>slopes</b> are altered {{in a way}} that is different from wave interaction with mild slopes. Studies on detailed characterization of such phenomenon on <b>steep</b> <b>slopes</b> are scanty. In this study, an attempt has been made to quantify the wave shoaling coefficient (K-s) on <b>steep</b> <b>slopes.</b> Wave shoaling and reflection characteristics are studied on <b>steep</b> <b>sloped</b> (1 / 2. 8, 1 / 3. 8, 1 / 5. 6), smooth and impermeable beaches a physical wave tank facility. The thorough analysis of experimentally measured wave heights along the <b>steep</b> <b>slopes</b> revealed that K-s is influenced by relative depth which is the ratio of shoaling depth (d(sh)) and shoaling wave length (L-sh) as well as surf similarity parameter (xi) and this led to an empirical formula between K-s and other important parameters related to initial wave and beach slope conditions. Through this study, application of linear wave theory (LWT) has been extended for the estimation of shoaling coefficients on <b>steep</b> <b>slopes,</b> which otherwise reported to be not applicable. The derived empirical relations were also tested for the results obtained from experiments performed on a gentle slope (1 / 100) for similar test conditions. The details of experimental program, analyzing methodology and results are discussed in this paper...|$|R
50|$|The gentler slopes to {{the east}} and north are settled, while the <b>steeper</b> <b>slopes</b> to the west and south are free of buildings. The <b>steepest</b> <b>slope</b> is to the south, where it reaches the sea within a {{distance}} of 400 meters.|$|R
50|$|<b>Steep</b> <b>slopes</b> {{encourage}} rapid soil loss by {{erosion and}} allow less rainfall {{to enter the}} soil before running off and hence, little mineral deposition in lower profiles. In semiarid regions, the lower effective rainfall on <b>steeper</b> <b>slopes</b> also results in less complete vegetative cover, so there is less plant contribution to soil formation. For all of these reasons, <b>steep</b> <b>slopes</b> prevent the formation of soil from getting very far ahead of soil destruction. Therefore, soils on steep terrain tend to have rather shallow, poorly developed profiles in comparison to soils on nearby, more level sites.|$|R
5|$|Due to the <b>steep</b> <b>slope</b> {{on which}} the {{building}} is situated, {{it had to be}} specially designed out of concrete to fit into its foundations correctly. From the front, the building appears to have only three floors. However, from the rear, all of its six floors can be seen. One part of the building's foundation was made of concrete piles, and the other as a continuous foundation. Usually, these two approaches do not mix well but Horodecki somehow succeeded in overcoming this technical problem.|$|E
5|$|Harold's forces {{deployed}} in a small, dense formation {{at the top}} of <b>steep</b> <b>slope,</b> with their flanks protected by woods and marshy ground in front of them. The line may have extended far enough to be anchored on a nearby stream. The English formed a shield wall, with the front ranks holding their shields close together or even overlapping to provide protection from attack. Sources differ on the exact site that the English fought on: some sources state the site of the abbey, but some newer sources suggest it was Caldbec Hill.|$|E
5|$|Nathu La has {{moderately}} shallow, excessively drained, coarse, and {{loamy soil}} on a <b>steep</b> <b>slope</b> (30–50%) with gravelly loamy surface, moderate erosion, and moderate stoniness.

5|$|On 22 December Hinkler, {{accompanied}} by John F. Leeming, {{president of the}} Lancashire Aero Club, made another attempt. The landing was no problem. On the <b>steep</b> <b>slope</b> and with a strong headwind the plane stopped quickly. Professor E. R. Dodds witnessed the landing. The uphill take-off was more difficult and the plane dived {{off the edge of}} the summit with insufficient airspeed, but picked up speed as it dived, narrowly missing Striding Edge, to return to Manchester.|$|E
5|$|At 03:00 on 26 October, Oka's unit {{finally reached}} and {{attacked}} the Marine defenses near the Matanikau. Oka's troops assaulted all along an east-west saddle ridge held by Hanneken's battalion but concentrated particularly on Hanneken's Company F, which defended the extreme left {{flank of the}} Marine positions on the ridge. A Company F machine gun section under Mitchell Paige killed many of the Japanese attackers, but Japanese fire eventually killed or injured almost all the Marine machine gunners. At 05:00, Oka's 3rd Battalion, 4th Infantry succeeded in scaling the <b>steep</b> <b>slope</b> of the ridge and pushed the surviving members of Company F off the crest.|$|E
5|$|Located in the Northern Rockies, Missoula has {{a typical}} Rocky Mountain ecology. Local {{wildlife}} includes populations of white-tailed deer, black bears, osprey, and bald eagles. During the winter, rapid snowmelt on Mount Jumbo {{due to its}} <b>steep</b> <b>slope</b> leaves grass available for grazing elk and mule deer. The rivers around Missoula provide nesting habitats for bank swallows, northern rough-winged swallows and belted kingfishers. Killdeer and spotted sandpipers can be seen foraging for insects along the gravel bars. Other species include song sparrows, catbirds, several species of warblers, and the pileated woodpecker. The rivers also provide cold, clean water for native fish such as westslope cutthroat trout and bull trout. The meandering streams also attract beaver and wood ducks. The parks also host a variety of snakes such as racers, garter snakes, and rubber boa.|$|E

5|$|Work {{on the new}} {{fortification}} {{was completed}} in 1068. Probably at first a wooden keep was constructed, which was later replaced with a much stronger stone one. Lincoln Castle is very unusual in having two mottes, the only other surviving {{example of such a}} design being at Lewes. To the south, where the Roman wall stands {{on the edge of a}} <b>steep</b> <b>slope,</b> it was retained partially as a curtain wall and partially as a revetment retaining the mottes. In the west, where the ground is more level, the Roman wall was buried within an earth rampart and extended upward to form the Norman castle wall. The Roman west gate (on the same site as the castle's west gate) was excavated in the 19th century but began to collapse on exposure, and so was re-buried.|$|E
5|$|Although {{orders for}} the attack had been hurried and lacking in detail, and the {{strength}} of the defenders unknown, the assaulting force had prevailed, securing the ridge with only limited offensive support. During the fighting one of the B Company platoon commanders, Lieutenant Eric Larsen, who had only the week before led the crossing at Kujin, was killed. One of the section commanders, Corporal Jeff Jones, immediately took command of the 5 Platoon assault, moving from section to section across the <b>steep</b> <b>slope</b> to direct their fire, even while under heavy Chinese mortar and machine-gun fire. He was awarded the US Silver Star for his actions. The successful assault opened the road south, enabling the Middlesex battalion, brigade headquarters and a number of supporting units to withdraw down the road through the Australians, followed by the Argylls. 3 RAR remained behind as a rearguard while the British battalions took up new positions, covering the Chongchon River crossing at Anju. Chinese mortars and machine-gun fire continued to fall on 3 RAR, and at 17:00 a round destroyed the A Company headquarters, killing two men and wounding four others, including Chitts who was evacuated by stretcher.|$|E
5|$|FitzRoy's {{instructions}} from the Admiralty required a detailed geological survey of a circular coral atoll to investigate how coral reefs formed, particularly whether they rose {{from the bottom of}} the sea or from the summits of extinct volcanoes, and the effects of tides measured with specially constructed gauges. He chose the Keeling Islands in the Indian Ocean, and on arrival on 1 April the entire crew set to work. Darwin found a coconut economy, serving both the small settlement and wildlife. There was a limited range of native plants and no land birds, but hermit crabs everywhere. The lagoons teemed with a rich variety of invertebrates and fish, and he examined the atoll's structure in view of the theory he had developed in Lima, of encircling reefs becoming atolls as an island sank. This idea was supported by the numerous soundings FitzRoy had taken showing a <b>steep</b> <b>slope</b> outside the reef with no living corals below 20–30 fathoms (10–15m).|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, American general Stephen Van Rensselaer III, a Federalist {{political}} appointee, {{in command}} of a sizable army near Lewiston, was pressured by the American president to invade. Although Van Rensselaer had severe doubts {{about the quality of}} his troops, {{he had no choice but}} to attack. He was an inexperienced militia general, and not trusted by the majority of regular army troops. In the early morning of 13 October 1812, he attempted to cross the Niagara River, leading to the Battle of Queenston Heights. Despite heavy fire from British artillery, the first wave of Americans (under Captain John E. Wool) managed to land, and then follow a fishermen's path up to the heights. From this point, they attacked and routed the British artillery. Brock had arrived from nearby Fort George and moved up to the artillery battery to gain a better view only minutes before Wool attacked. He, his aides, and the gunners were forced to beat a hasty retreat, leading their horses down the <b>steep</b> <b>slope.</b>|$|E
5|$|Still {{farther north}} along the {{mountain}} ridge, in the Battle Mountain area, the battle was going poorly for the 24th Infantry. After C Company lost Battle Mountain, heavy UN airstrikes and artillery fire struck its crest in preparation for an infantry counterattack planned to regain the mountain from the North Koreans. The hot and sultry weather made climbing the <b>steep</b> <b>slope</b> difficult, but L Company was on top by 12:00 on August 21. North Korean troops had left the summit under fire from the UN aircraft, artillery, and mortars. The North Koreans placed their own mortar fire on the crest and prevented L Company from consolidating its position. This situation continued until mid afternoon when a North Korean platoon {{came out of the}} trenches on the eastern slope of the mountain and surprised a platoon of L Company with an attack from behind. The other two platoons of L Company, upon hearing firing, started to leave their positions and drift down the hill. The North Koreans swiftly reoccupied the peak while officers tried to assemble L and I Companies on the eastern slope. Elements of E Company also left their position during the day.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese had {{developed}} the position considerably, establishing a complex defensive network and, whereas {{up until that}} point they had usually withdrawn {{in the face of}} the advancing Australians, they decided to make a stand. Employing a 75mm gun, which was fired over open sights due to the closeness of the fighting, along with some 37mm guns and a number of machine guns of varying calibre, they fought fiercely. Halted by fire, the Australians called in fire support to overwhelm the Japanese with fire superiority, and resorting to employing the indirect method that would characterise their operations during this phase of the advance, and which was necessitated by the depleted state of their forces. Moving up a <b>steep</b> <b>slope</b> that was covered by kunai grass, one of the tanks broke down, nevertheless the Australian armour was able to deliver a significant bombardment which enabled the infantry to take the position early in the evening.|$|E

5|$|The {{perimeter}} wall of {{the citadel}} is not a continuous fortification wall, but consists of the façades of approximately 100 houses that have been built against each other. Because they have been built {{on or near the}} <b>steep</b> <b>slope</b> of the citadel mound, many of these façades were strengthened by buttresses to prevent their collapse or subsidence. There were circa 30 city-palaces; most of them located along the perimeter of the citadel. The oldest surviving house that can be securely dated through an inscription was built in 1893. The oldest houses {{can be found on the}} southeastern side of the mound, whereas houses on the northern perimeter date to the 1930s–1940s. Before the introduction of modern building techniques, most houses on the citadel were built around a courtyard. A raised arcade overlooking the courtyard, a flat roof and a bent-access entrance to prevent views of the courtyard and the interior of the house were characteristic elements of the houses on the citadel.|$|E
5|$|The {{remains of}} Ahmose's pyramid in Abydos were {{discovered}} in 1899 and identified as his in 1902. Most of its outer casing stones had been robbed for use in other building projects over the years, and the mound of rubble upon which it was built has collapsed. However, two rows of intact casing stones were found by Arthur Mace, who estimated its <b>steep</b> <b>slope</b> as about 60 degrees, {{based on the evidence}} of the limestone casing (compare to the less acute 51 degrees of the Great Pyramid of Giza). Adjacent to the main pyramid temple and to its east, Harvey has identified two temples constructed by Ahmose's queen, Ahmose-Nefertary. One of these structures also bears bricks stamped with the name of Chief Treasurer Neferperet, the official responsible for re-opening the stone quarries at el-Ma'asara (Tura) in Ahmose's year 22. A third, larger temple (Temple C) is similar to the pyramid temple in form and scale, but its stamped bricks and details of decoration reinforce that it was a cult place for Ahmose-Nefertary.|$|E
5|$|Two weeks later, on {{the night}} 19/20 April 1943, the {{battalion}} {{took part in the}} 5th Infantry Brigade's attack on the Tunisian village of Takrouna. The village was situated atop a <b>steep</b> <b>slope,</b> and the attack stalled due to heavy concentrations of indirect fire and landmines, which wounded a number of men, including the commanding officer. Nevertheless, two sections under the command of Sergeant Haane te Rauawa Manahi, managed to scale the western side of the escarpment and gain a foothold on the pinnacle in the early dawn. Following heavy shellfire and hand-to-hand combat with the Italian defenders, the Māoris were forced off the pinnacle twice; each time, though, Manahi led his small force in a counterattack. In the afternoon, Manahi and two other men captured a number of machine gun and mortar positions, encircling the Italians and forcing them to surrender. For these actions, Manahi was also recommended for a Victoria Cross, but the nomination was not approved and he received a Distinguished Conduct Medal instead.|$|E
