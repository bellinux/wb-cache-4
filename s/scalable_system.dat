It is notable {{for the inclusion of}} the Hybrid EuCon Digital Audio Workstation control protocol functionality as standard. Hybrid EuCon DAW control is offered as a cost option on the larger System 5 console and its inclusion in the base system is the rationale behind the marketing term 'Fusion', the 'S5' part of the product name is derived from 'System 5'.
