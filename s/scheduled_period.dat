30|$|Today, taxis are an {{important}} component of China’s urban public transit network. However, taxi drivers frequently work under extremely stressful and hazardous conditions, including long working hours, frequent driving, and occasional disputes with passengers, all of which increase drivers’ physical and mental stress. A survey in Beijing reported that taxi drivers worked up to 11  h per day and at least 27.8  days per month [1]. Taxi drivers in Tlahuac, Mexico City were found to drive 11.1  h a day behind the wheel [2]. Another survey in Sydney showed that 67 % of taxi drivers drove at least 50  h per week [3]. Obviously, taxi drivers’ e daily earnings rely heavily on their driving distance within a <b>scheduled</b> <b>period,</b> so they must spend long hours driving in order to carry more passengers and earn more money. Therefore, {{it is no surprise that}} taxi drivers engage in occupational risks while driving.|$|E
40|$|Unit {{commitment}} (UC) is {{to determine}} the optimal unit status and generation level during each time interval of the <b>scheduled</b> <b>period.</b> The purpose of UC is to minimize the total generation cost while satisfying system demand, reserve requirements, and unit constraints. Among the UC constraints, an adequate provision of reserve is important to ensure the security of power system and the fast-response reserve is essential to bring system frequency back to acceptable level following the loss of an online unit within a few seconds. In this paper, the authors present and solve a UC prob-lem including the frequency-based reserve constraints to determine the optimal FRR requirements and unit MW sched-ules. The UC problem is solved by using Lagrangian Relaxation-based approach and compared with the actual system schedules. It is observed that favorable reserve and unit MW schedules are obtained by the proposed method while the system security is maintained...|$|E
