50|$|Under {{the action}} of steady wind, free snow {{particles}} accumulate and drift like the sand grains in barchan dunes, and the resulting drifting snow shapes are also popularly referred to as barchans. Inuit of Canada call them kalutoqaniq. When winds slacken, the drifted formations consolidate via sublimation and recrystallization. Subsequent winds erode kalutoqaniq into the sculptured forms of <b>sastrugi.</b> Inuit call large sculpturings kaioqlaq and small ripples tumarinyiq. Further erosion may turn kaioqlaq back into drifting kalutoqaniq. An intermediate stage of erosion is mapsuk, an overhanging shape. On the windward side of a ridge, the base erodes faster than the top, producing a shape like an anvil tip pointing upwind.|$|E

40|$|In polar regions, <b>sastrugi</b> are {{a direct}} manifestation of {{drifting}} snow and form the main surface roughness elements. In turn, <b>sastrugi</b> alter {{the generation of}} atmospheric turbulence and thus modify the wind field and the aeolian snow mass fluxes. Little {{attention has been paid}} to these feedback processes, mainly because of experimental difficulties. As a result, most polar atmospheric models currently ignore <b>sastrugi</b> over snow-covered regions. This paper aims at quantifying the potential influence of <b>sastrugi</b> on the local wind field and on snow erosion over a sastrugi-covered snowfield in coastal Adélie Land, East Antarctica. We focus on two erosion events during which <b>sastrugi</b> responses to shifts in wind direction have been interpreted from temporal variations in drag and aeolian snow mass flux measurements during austral winter 2013.

40|$|The {{observations}} {{were made on}} net ablation of some of <b>sastrugi</b> and drifts (like barchanoids) in the area subjected to strong katabatic winds between 100 and 200 km inland from the Antarctic coast near Syowa Station in September and November, 1969 and in January, 1970 {{by means of the}} stake measurements. The net ablation of hard <b>sastrugi</b> during the period from November to January (mean 2. 8 cm/month) was larger than that from September to November (mean 0. 7 cm/month). The large amount of ablation from November to January may be attributed to the increase of solar radiation which accelerates sublimation-deflation on the surface of <b>sastrugi.</b> On the other hand, net ablation of soft <b>sastrugi</b> and drifts from September to November was larger than that from November to January. The large amount of ablation from September to November may be attributed to the strong erosion by the wind, since <b>sastrugi</b> and drifts were soft. Since they were hardened or flattened after erosion by the wind from September to November, the ablation from November to January was not larger than that from September to November. Since the rate of ablation at the top of <b>sastrugi</b> and drifts was higher than that at the surrounding surface in late spring and summer, and the bulk of yearly accumulation is deposited in autumn and winter, {{it can be said that}} surface irregularities are supposed to be built up in winter, then smoothed in summer. The best season for yearly stake measurements is considered to be the end of summer when the more accurate value of mean net accumulation may be expected since surface irregularities are less than any other season. Gow (1965) and WELLER (1969) gave some explanation for the higher rate of net ablation of <b>sastrugi</b> than the surrounding surface at the South Pole and Plateau Station. However, since the area of this report is located where the katabatic winds are strong as mentioned above, the situation is different from their case. According to the logarithmic increase of wind velocity, the top of <b>sastrugi</b> is expected to be subjected to stronger winds, hence greater wind erosion, than the surrounding surface...|$|E
40|$|Frequencies of snow surface {{features}} such as <b>sastrugi,</b> dunes and thermal cracks were measured along the traverse route from the coastal region to {{the summit of the}} Queen Maud Land ice sheet, Dome Fuji Station, East Antarctica. The study route can be clearly divided into three regions {{on the basis of the}} regional characteristics of snow surface features : coastal region, katabatic wind region and inland plateau region. The coastal region is characterized by high frequency of small <b>sastrugi</b> and low frequency of dunes. The katabatic wind region is characterized by the co-exis-tence of small and large <b>sastrugi,</b> dunes and glazed surface. The inland region is characterized by low frequencies of small <b>sastrugi</b> and dunes. These regional characteristics of snow surface features reflect the deposition-erosion process affected by surface topography of the ice sheet.

40|$|The Cloud and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) {{instruments}} on NASA's Terra, Aqua and Soumi NPP satellites {{are used}} to provide a long-term measurement of Earth's energy budget. To accomplish this, the radiances measured by the instruments must be inverted to fluxes {{by the use of}} a scene-type-dependent angular distribution model (ADM). For permanent snow scenes over Antarctica, shortwave (SW) ADMs are created by compositing radiance measurements over the full viewing zenith and azimuth range. However, the presence of small-scale wind blown roughness features called <b>sastrugi</b> cause the BRDF (bidirectional reflectance distribution function) of the snow to vary significantly based upon the solar azimuth angle and location. This can result in monthly regional biases between − 12 and 7. 5 Wm − 2 in the inverted TOA (top-of-atmosphere) SW flux. The bias is assessed by comparing the CERES shortwave fluxes derived from nadir observations with those from all viewing zenith angles, as the <b>sastrugi</b> affect fluxes inverted from the oblique viewing angles more than for the nadir viewing angles. In this paper we further describe the clear-sky Antarctic ADMs from Su et al. (2015). These ADMs account for the <b>sastrugi</b> effect by using measurements from the Multi-Angle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MISR) instrument to derive statistical relationships between radiance from different viewing angles. We show here that these ADMs reduce the bias and artifacts in the CERES SW flux caused by <b>sastrugi,</b> both locally and Antarctic-wide. The regional monthly biases from <b>sastrugi</b> are reduced to between − 5 and 7 Wm − 2, and the monthly-mean biases over Antarctica are reduced by up to 0. 64 Wm − 2, a decrease of 74 %.

These instruments were installed at different sites, on the drift snow, on the <b>sastrugi</b> and on the glazed surface. In winter the surface temperature measured by these different methods is roughly similar, but in spring and summer the surface temperature depends upon the density of snow and the wind speed.

We then use the rough surface boundary conditions of conical scattering from the coherent part, in the incoherent radiative transfer equations. The radiative transfer equations are then solved iteratively that includes multiple interactions between the layered structures and the rough surfaces. Simulation results indicate that large third and fourth Stokes parameters are obtained because of the coupling of large angle transmissions of the rough surfaces with the internal reflections of layered structures.

40|$|Abstract — WindSat has systemically {{collected}} the first global passive polarimetric data over both land and ocean at three frequencies: 10. 7, 18. 7 and 37 GHz, including the brightness temperatures at {{vertical and horizontal}} polarizations, and the real and imaginary parts of the cross-correlation of the vertical and horizontal polarizations. Prior to the launch of WindSat, it was commonly believed that land polarimetric signatures at satellite footprint scales are below instrumental noise levels {{and do not have}} any useful geophysical information. On the contrary, WindSat polarimetric data exhibit distinct geophysical and observation geometry signatures, particularly over Greenland and Antarctic where the signatures are related to snow accumulation, melting and metamorphism. The third and fourth Stokes parameters show well defined, large azimuth modulation which is correlated with geophysical variations, particularly with snow metamorphism, and has consistent seasonal variation. We use simple empirical models to separate and quantify such azimuthal modulations and geophysical changes. By comparing the temporal variations of harmonic coefficients and brightness temperature signatures in vertical and horizontal polarization channels, we find that both volume and surface scattering have important contributions to the polarimetric signature. Such signatures are relatively weak in the summer, when <b>sastrugi</b> are small and surface scattering is significant, and are strongest in spring, when the <b>sastrugi</b> are larger and volume scattering is important.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} {{increased}} interest in using SAR to study and monitor glaciers and ice sheets for glaciological and climate change research. However, due to the medium's complexity, SAR backscattering from ice remains poorly understood, including the relative importance of scattering from surface and volume layers, and dependencies on frequency and glacier zone. Extreme weather conditions can result in quickly changing surface conditions influencing backscatter signatures, while leaving the underlying volume of interest unchanged. Surface and volume components must thus be separated in order to infer information regarding the properties of the ice volume. This paper describes a three-component scattering model to decompose polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images of glacier ice. Total backscatter is modeled as the incoherent summation of surface, volume and <b>sastrugi</b> (wind-induced feature) components. The proposed model adapts and extends the Freeman and Durden decomposition for an ice volume scenario in which the volume is a dielectric medium. Forms of the model for both random and oriented volumes are considered and a new oriented <b>sastrugi</b> component is introduced which is able to explain backscatter behavior between different winter scenes.

40|$|Antarctica is a {{continent}} {{with a strong}} character. High wind speeds, very low temperatures and heavy snow storms. All these parameters are well known due to observations and measurements, but precipitation measurements are still rare {{because the number of}} manned stations is very limited in Antarctica. In such a polar snow region many wind driven phenomena associated with snow fall exist like snow drift, blowing snow or <b>sastrugi.</b> Snow drift is defined as a layer of snow formed by the wind during a snowstorm. The horizontal visibility is below eye level. Blowing snow is specified as an ensemble of snow particles raised by the wind to moderate or great heights above the ground; the horizontal visibility at eye level is generally very poor (National Snow And Ice Data Center (NSIDC), 2013). <b>Sastrugi</b> are complex, fragile and sharp ridges or grooves formed on land or over sea ice. They arise from wind erosion, saltation of snow particles and deposition. To get more details about these procedures better instruments than the conventional stake array are required. This small report introduces a new measuring technique and therefore offers a never used dataset of snow heights. It is very common to measure the snow height with a stake array in Antarctica (f. e.

40|$|Abstract—While {{designed}} for ocean observation, scatterometer and radiometer data have proven very useful {{in a variety}} of cryosphere studies. Over large regions of Antarctica, ice sheet and bedrock topography and the snow deposition, drift, and erosional environment combine to produce roughness on various scales. Roughness ranges from broad, basin-scale ice-sheet topography at 100 km wavelengths to large, spatially coherent dune fields at 10 km wavelength to erosional features on the meter scale known as <b>sastrugi.</b> These roughness scales influence the microwave backscattering and emission properties of the surface, combining to introduce azimuth-angle dependencies in the satellite observation data. In this paper, we explore the use of NASA scatterometer (NSCAT) data, European remote sensing (ERS) advanced microwave instrument (AMI) scatterometer mode data, and special sensor microwave/imager (SSM/I) data to study surface roughness effects in Antarctica. All three sensors provide strong evidence of azimuth modulation, which is correlated with the surface slope environment and results in a katabatic wind flow regime. Due to its broad azimuth coverage, NSCAT data appears to be the best suited for azimuth-angle observations. A simple empirical model for the azimuth variation in the radar backscatter is developed, and an algorithm for computing the parameters of the model from NSCAT data at a fine scale is presented. Results indicate relationships exist between the azimuthal variation of the data and the orientation of the surface slope and small-scale roughness relative to the sensor-look direction.

The azimuth modulation signature in this region is characterized by higher backscatter, less modulation, and more local maxima than in a nearby non-dune region. We develop a fourth-order best-fit model to describe the azimuth modulation and apply it independently to two disjoint portions of the megadune region. The locations of the vertices of these boundaries are listed in table I. The regions are not continued farther south because visual images show that the dunes there are less coherent.
