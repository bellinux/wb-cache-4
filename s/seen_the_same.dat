5|$|The Tempest can be {{interpreted}} as Shakespeare's last treatise on the human soul, in particular the Renaissance conception of the tripartite soul divided into vegetative, sensitive, and rational spheres, as described in Plato's tripartite theory of soul and Christian Philosophy. This was later also described in Sigmund Freud's id, ego and super-ego which was first linked to The Tempest in the 1956 screenplay for Forbidden Planet by Cyril Hume, Irving Block, and Allen Adler. The film presents Caliban reinterpreted as the 'monster from the Id', although the theory is dismissed as 'obsolete' in that imagined future, and was also dismissed by James E Phillips in 1964. Prospero is exiled to an island with a symbol of his baser, 'vegetative' nature – Caliban – and his higher, 'sensitive' or supernatural side – Ariel. Some productions have <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> actor play all three roles, making them symbols of the conflict within a fully actualised or awakened Prospero – that between crude selfish physicality and a higher, mystical side.|$|E

[...] Elton's on-camera narration forms a present-day frame story to a series of flashbacks related to the Doctor. Elton recalls a chance meeting with the Doctor and remembers having <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> man as a child in his living room one night. On the internet he discovers others, including Ursula Blake (Shirley Henderson), who have also reported similar experiences with the Doctor. Elton and Ursula form a group known as LINDA, the [...] "London Investigation [...] 'N' [...] Detective Agency". They are joined by three other people: Bridget (Moya Brady), Bliss (Kathryn Drysdale), and Mr Skinner (Simon Greenall). LINDA meets in a library basement to discuss their experiences, but soon their meetings become more social in nature.|$|E

2500|$|Since the 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq, Karbala province had not <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> intensity {{of violence that}} had wracked other areas of Iraq such as Baghdad and Al Anbar province. [...] Although Karbala had been the site of many attacks, it had largely been free of the spectacular bombings that regularly took place in Baghdad or the heavy urban warfare seen in Fallujah, Mosul, Najaf, Ramadi, and elsewhere. [...] There were two notable exceptions: the March 2004 Ashura massacre and the uprising of Muqtada al-Sadr's Mahdi Army across southern Iraq the following month.

A computer analysis of the footage concluded it was a solid, three-dimensional object.

An investigation conducted by Benjamin Radford with Joe Nickell and John Kirk for the National Geographic Channel TV show Is It Real?, in 2005 revealed that the object Folden filmed was indeed a real animal but its size had been greatly overestimated.

2500|$|Cyclospora is a {{gastrointestinal}} pathogen {{that causes}} fever, diarrhea, vomiting, and severe weight loss. [...] Outbreaks {{of the disease}} occurred in Chicago in 1989 and other areas in the United States. But investigation by the Center for Disease Control could not identify an infectious cause. The discovery of the cause was made by Mr. Ramachandran Rajah, {{the head of a}} medical clinic's laboratory in Kathmandu, Nepal. Mr. Rajah was trying to discover why local residents and visitors were becoming ill every summer. He identified an unusual looking organism in stool samples from patients who were sick. But when the clinic sent slides of the organism to the Center for Disease Control, it was identified as blue-green algae, which is harmless. Many pathologists had <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thing before, but dismissed it as irrelevant to the patient's disease. Later, the organism would be identified as a special kind of parasite, and treatment would be developed to help patients with the infection.

2500|$|The {{prosecutor}} provided embarrassing {{details of}} the crime to the jury. He described how Hitchen and Williamson moved from Royal Oak in the Strand to Rummer Tavern {{and came to the}} Talbot Inn, where the under-marshal ordered a bedroom. Along the way in each bar Hitchen offered either beer or wine and showed disgraceful manners. Williamson said he wanted to leave the marshal but was not allowed to, being forced to leave his hat with him and receiving a little money in return. According to Williamson's testimony he was persuaded to follow the marshal into the room, where he [...] "did all that a beastly appetite could prompt him to". Williamson reported going to his relative, Joseph Cockrost, who took him back to the tavern and asked to be informed as soon as the prisoner appeared, which happened the following Saturday. In his testimony Cockrost mentioned knocking at the door after seeing [...] "filthy actions" [...] through the keyhole. When opening the door he took the marshal by the collar and threatened him, saying, [...] "I'll whip you through the Gills" [...] when he laid his hand on the sword. Testimonies were given by a servant of the tavern proving to have <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> scene with the prosecutor, a constable, John Carter, watchmen and some character witnesses. Interestingly, the constable opposed the watchmen, who were probably trying to accuse Williamson of inventing the story. At last, the prisoner was acquitted of actual sodomy and found guilty on the second charge, assault. For [...] "sodomitical practices" [...] Hitchen was fined [...] £20 and sentenced to 6 months imprisonment and standing in the pillory near the end of Catherine Street, in the Strand.|$|E
