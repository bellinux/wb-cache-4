5|$|Balfour's <b>social</b> <b>standing</b> {{appears to}} have been a {{significant}} factor in his appointment.|$|E
5|$|After getting established, on December 17, 1818, Sharp {{at the age}} of 31 married Eliza T. Scott, the {{daughter}} of a physician who had served as an officer in the War of 1812. She was from Frankfort and above him in <b>social</b> <b>standing.</b> They had three children together. He moved the family to the state capital of Frankfort in 1820 for his political career.|$|E
5|$|Favre died in 1813, leaving many minor {{children}} and a substantial estate of more than 5000 acres of land and 57 slaves. He had 13 known children with three different women, and leaves numerous descendants. A well-known descendant is former National Football League quarterback Brett Favre. Simon Favre's associations with property owners and prominent officials demonstrate {{that he was a}} person of very high <b>social</b> <b>standing.</b>|$|E
50|$|PTAWUG connects {{members from}} vastly {{different}} backgrounds and <b>social</b> <b>standings</b> {{and provides a}} sandbox for technology experimentation and community skills development.|$|R
50|$|All the parties, groupings {{and people}} of all <b>social</b> <b>standings</b> should be given equal {{opportunities}} for dialogue and bilateral and multilateral dialogues be developed.|$|R
50|$|The {{speech of}} the lovers Lady Milford, Luise and Ferdinand {{takes on a}} special position. Their use of {{language}} usually does not display their <b>social</b> <b>standings.</b>|$|R
5|$|Heydrich's family held <b>social</b> <b>standing</b> and {{substantial}} financial means. Music {{was a part}} of Heydrich's everyday life; his father founded the Halle Conservatory of Music, Theatre and Teaching and his mother taught piano there. Heydrich developed a passion for the violin and carried that interest into adulthood; he impressed listeners with his musical talent.|$|E
5|$|The Interstate grew quickly, {{along with}} the {{automobile}} industry, allowing a new-found mobility that permeated ways of American life and culture. The automobile and the Interstate became the American symbol of individuality and freedom, and, for the first time, automobile buyers accepted that the automobile they drove indicated their <b>social</b> <b>standing</b> and level of affluence. It became a statement of their personality and an extension of their self-concepts.|$|E
5|$|The {{usage of}} ain't in the {{southern}} United States is distinctive, however, in the continued usage of the word by well-educated, cultivated speakers. Ain't is in common usage of educated Southerners. In the South, the use of ain't {{can be used as}} a marker to separate cultured speakers from those who lack confidence in their <b>social</b> <b>standing</b> and thus avoid its use entirely.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, Byrd co-starred in Easy A {{opposite}} Emma Stone. He played Brandon, a gay {{friend of}} Stone's character Olive Penderghast, whom she pretends {{to have sex}} with at a house party to boost their <b>social</b> <b>standings.</b>|$|R
50|$|Although {{little more}} {{is known about}} Percivall Pott's private life, Pott is {{regularly}} described as having excellent character, and an archetypical English surgeon. It is believed that Pott's standard of living was {{a contributor to the}} rise of the surgeon within <b>social</b> <b>standings.</b>|$|R
50|$|On June 10, Roh Tae-woo was {{nominated}} {{as a candidate}} for the presidency in a party convention of Democratic Justice Party at Jamsil Arena. Major demonstrations occurred throughout the country, with an estimated 240,000 people participating in 22 cities including Seoul. Many people of all <b>social</b> <b>standings</b> joined and supported participants.|$|R
5|$|A fold of semi-wild Highland cattle was studied, over {{a period}} of 4 years. It was found that the cattle have a clear {{structure}} and hierarchy of dominance, which reduced aggression. <b>Social</b> <b>standing</b> depended on age and sex, with older cattle being dominant to calves and younger ones and males dominant to females. Young bulls would dominate adult cows when they reached around 2 years of age. Calves from the top ranking cow were given higher social status, despite minimal intervention from their mother. Playfighting, licking and mounting were seen as friendly contact.|$|E
5|$|Crinolines {{were worn}} by women of every <b>social</b> <b>standing</b> and class across the Western world, from royalty to factory workers. This led to {{widespread}} media scrutiny and criticism, particularly in satirical magazines such as Punch. They were also hazardous if worn without due care. Thousands of women {{died in the}} mid-19th century {{as a result of}} their hooped skirts catching fire. Alongside fire, other hazards included the hoops being caught in machinery, carriage wheels, gusts of wind, or other obstacles.|$|E
5|$|Food and cuisine in Ireland {{takes its}} {{influence}} from the crops grown and animals farmed in the island's temperate climate {{and from the}} social and political circumstances of Irish history. For example, whilst from the Middle Ages until the arrival of the potato in the 16th century the dominant feature of the Irish economy was the herding of cattle, the number of cattle a person owned was equated to their <b>social</b> <b>standing.</b> Thus herders would avoid slaughtering a milk-producing cow.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to {{evaluate}} the legal, economic, <b>social</b> <b>standings</b> of cooperatives in the current legal environment of the Czech Republic, {{as well as the}} history of cooperatives not only in the Czech lands, but also in Europe. In particular, it explores the roles of cooperatives in social housing...|$|R
50|$|In this inscription, Iucundus {{was very}} exact in the details. He {{included}} {{the date and}} the list of witnesses, which were listed in descending order of social status. So by examining several of his tablets, {{it is possible to}} determine the relative <b>social</b> <b>standings</b> of clients with whom Iucundus arranged numerous transactions.|$|R
50|$|Other {{elements}} {{that contributed to}} the riots were a series of miscommunications between the students and the University administration, {{and the nature of the}} University itself, which was an institution that encouraged non-traditional educational philosophy, openness and accessible higher education to a wider range of students from different backgrounds and different <b>social</b> <b>standings.</b>|$|R
5|$|In England, ain't is {{generally}} considered a non-standard or illiterate usage, as it is used by speakers of a lower socio-economic class, or by educated people in an informal manner. In the nineteenth century, ain't was often used by writers to denote regional dialects such as Cockney English. Ain't is a non-standard feature commonly found in mainstream Australian English, and in New Zealand, ain't is a feature of Maori-influenced English. In American English, usage of ain't corresponds to a middle level of education, although {{it is widely believed}} that its use establishes of lack of education or <b>social</b> <b>standing</b> in the speaker.|$|E
5|$|Rand {{did not use}} a {{specific}} architect {{as a model for}} Keating. Her inspiration for the character came from a neighbor she knew while working in Hollywood in the early 1930s. Rand asked this young woman to explain her goals in life. The woman's response was focused on social comparisons: the neighbor wanted her material possessions and <b>social</b> <b>standing</b> to equal or exceed those of other people. Rand created Keating as an archetype of this motivation, which she saw as the opposite of self-interest.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} {{employs the}} Scout method, a programme of informal education {{with an emphasis}} on practical outdoor activities, including camping, woodcraft, aquatics, hiking, backpacking, and sports. Another widely recognized movement characteristic is the Scout uniform, by intent hiding all differences of <b>social</b> <b>standing</b> in a country and making for equality, with neckerchief and campaign hat or comparable headwear. Distinctive uniform insignia include the fleur-de-lis and the trefoil, as well as badges and other patches.|$|E
50|$|María meets {{and falls}} in love with Javier during his visit to the Hacienda. María is captivated by Javier, who despite his wealth -and unlike his family- has a good soul and is unconcerned by <b>social</b> <b>standings.</b> Javier in turn, {{falls in love}} with María, realizing that her nature is even more {{attractive}} than her physical beauty.|$|R
50|$|Most {{people of}} Vietnamese origin in Brazil still {{preserve}} traditional customs, such as celebrating Tết (the lunar new year). Despite {{a lack of}} ingredients, traditional Vietnamese foods such as phở, and bánh chưng are still prepared in the traditional fashion. The Vietnamese community in Brazil remains relatively marginalized, {{in contrast to the}} <b>social</b> <b>standings</b> of other Overseas Vietnamese communities.|$|R
50|$|Like {{any other}} literature, The Tale of Chunhyang also {{reflects}} its society. Although {{the author is}} unknown, it is deducible that every nation was involved. The common people might get vicarious pleasure from the main characters who get over the difference of <b>social</b> <b>standings</b> and punish the greedy lord. Also keeping female's integrity is the traditional Korean's conservative moral.|$|R
5|$|Butch {{women were}} not a novelty in the 1950s; even in Harlem and Greenwich Village in the 1920s some women assumed these personae. In the 1950s and 1960s, however, the roles were {{pervasive}} and not limited to North America: from 1940 to 1970, butch/femme bar culture flourished in Britain, though there were fewer class distinctions. They further identified {{members of a group}} that had been marginalized; women who had been rejected by most of society had an inside view of an exclusive group of people that took a high amount of knowledge to function in. Butch and femme were considered coarse by American lesbians of higher <b>social</b> <b>standing</b> during this period. Many wealthier women married to satisfy their familial obligations, and others escaped to Europe to live as expatriates.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the individualistic Roark, Peter Keating is a conformist who bases his choices on what others want. Introduced to the reader as Roark's classmate in architecture school, Keating does not {{really want to be}} an architect. He loves painting, but his mother steers him toward architecture instead. In this as in all his decisions, Keating does what others expect rather than follow his personal interests. He becomes a social climber, focused on improving his career and <b>social</b> <b>standing</b> using a combination of personal manipulation and conformity to popular styles. He follows a similar path in his private life: He chooses a loveless marriage to Dominique instead of marrying the woman he loveswho lacks Dominique's beauty and social connections. By middle age, Keating's career is in decline and he is unhappy with his path, but it is too late for him to change.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th century Royal Navy, {{rank and}} {{position}} on board ship {{was defined by}} a mix of two hierarchies, an official hierarchy of ranks and a conventionally recognized social divide between gentlemen and non-gentlemen. Boys aspiring for a commission were often called young gentlemen instead of their substantive rating to distinguish their higher <b>social</b> <b>standing</b> from the ordinary sailors. Generally, aboard most warships common seamen berthed in the fo'c'sle, while officers were quartered at the stern. Occasionally, a midshipman would be posted aboard a ship in a lower rating such as able seaman but would eat and sleep with his social equals in the cockpit.|$|E
50|$|The league {{still stands}} behind the {{traditional}} values upon {{which it was}} founded in 1925. American Legion Baseball has taught hundreds of thousands of young Americans the importance of sportsmanship, good health and active citizenship. The program is also a promoter of equality, making teammates out of young athletes regardless of their income levels or <b>social</b> <b>standings.</b>|$|R
5000|$|If {{two people}} of {{different}} <b>social</b> <b>standings</b> talk to each other, the person with a higher position usually takes a more relaxed attitude. Their posture may be unbalanced, relaxed, and {{may appear to be}} nonchalant. A person with a lower position often maintains symmetrical posture by placing both hands on their lap or at their sides.|$|R
5|$|Jolin {{spent most}} of 1918 in Copenhagen, where he showed his {{paintings}} at an art gallery at Nikolaiplads. They sold well {{enough for him to}} stay in Denmark almost a year. Jolin enjoyed life in the Danish capital, the social life was more spontaneous than in Stockholm and people from different professions, or <b>social</b> <b>standings,</b> mixed with each other in a way that appealed to him.|$|R
5|$|It {{was common}} to leave gifts with the deceased. Both {{men and women}} {{received}} grave goods, even if the corpse was to be burnt on a pyre. A Norseman could also be buried with a loved one or house thrall, or cremated together on a funeral pyre. The amount {{and the value of}} the goods depended on which social group the dead person came from. It was important to bury the dead in the right way so that he could join the afterlife with the same <b>social</b> <b>standing</b> that he had had in life, and to avoid becoming a homeless soul that wandered eternally.|$|E
5|$|Morikawa Kaichirō {{identifies}} the subculture as distinctly Japanese, {{a product of}} the school system and society. Japanese schools have a class structure which functions as a caste system, but clubs are an exception to the social hierarchy. In these clubs, a student's interests will be recognized and nurtured, catering to the interests of otaku. Secondly, the vertical structure of Japanese society {{identifies the}} value of individuals by their success. Until the late 1980s, unathletic and unattractive males focused on academics, hoping to secure a good job and marry to raise their <b>social</b> <b>standing.</b> Those unable to succeed socially focused instead on their interests, often into adulthood, with their lifestyle centering on those interests, furthering the creation of the otaku subculture.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} three years, Jean and Marguerite de Carrouges had two more {{children}} and settled in Paris and Normandy, profiting from their celebrity with gifts and investments. In 1390, Carrouges was promoted to a chevalier d'honneur as a bodyguard of the King, a title which came with a substantial financial stipend and was a position of important <b>social</b> <b>standing.</b> The following year he was dispatched to Hungary {{on a mission to}} investigate the severity of the threat from the Ottoman Empire, the boundaries of which had been steadily spreading under Sultan Bayezid I. In this mission he was second in command to Jean de Boucicant, a Marshal of France and famous soldier, indicating the elevated social position Carrouges enjoyed following the duel.|$|E
50|$|The International Office of Marmara University and the student-oriented ESN Marmara {{organisation}} {{provide support}} to the foreigner students among the university. Every year the students of Marmara University Management Club organize an 'International Week' to promote the <b>social</b> <b>standings</b> {{of the international community}} of Marmara University along with offering a wide-ranged cultural program to the guest-students invited from all across the world to the event.|$|R
25|$|Society often {{constructs}} our behaviours and beliefs, such {{as personal}} developments, physiological and psychological interactions, {{and the common}} “perception of our bodies {{as a reflection of}} self worth”. Body image struggles have been prevalent for many centuries now, especially with the rapid constant shifts in ideal body types. In the past, norms were typically set by cultural beliefs, genders, or <b>social</b> <b>standings.</b> Despite these being prevalent today, changes in the fashion and media industries are other influences at hand.|$|R
5000|$|Gwangbokjeol {{is the day}} for celebrating {{liberation of}} the country from Japan in 1945 as well as celebrating the {{establishment}} of Korean government in 1948. Gwangbok means [...] "returned light" [...] representing gaining national sovereignty from Japan. It was first declared to be national holiday in 1949 October 1. On this date every year, the president of Korea visits Independence Hall, and invites diplomatic envoys from many countries and all <b>social</b> <b>standings</b> in countries to Cheongwadae (the Blue House, the Korean presidential residence).|$|R
