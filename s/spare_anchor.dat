25|$|Shortly afterwards, John Paul Jones got the {{opportunity}} {{he had been}} striving for—not a moment too soon, as his ship had been holed below the waterline and was becoming increasingly unresponsive. Serapis’ jib-boom caught in the rigging of Bonhomme Richard’s mizzen mast, and Jones immediately led his crew in attaching the two ships together as strongly as they could. Seeing the danger, Pearson dropped anchor. Because both ships were under sail, when Serapis {{came to an abrupt}} halt, Bonhomme Richard would keep going, and with luck, tear free. Jones’ men had been very efficient, so what actually happened was that Bonhomme Richard’s motion was turned into a rotation, and the two ships, still firmly attached, ended up side-by-side, facing in opposite directions, their great guns touching each other’s hull planks. Better still for Jones, Serapis’ <b>spare</b> <b>anchor</b> caught in the woodwork of Bonhomme Richard’s stern, locking the two ships in that extraordinary position. Making a virtue of necessity, Pearson’s crew fired broadsides straight into Bonhomme Richard’s hull, tearing huge holes in its side, and doing terrible damage to the gun-decks. For Jones’s boarding plan to succeed, he needed to drive all the Royal Navy sailors from Serapis’ deck before his ship was destroyed beneath him. He had prepared well for such an eventuality, and his men at stations up the masts were equipped both with small guns and with incendiary grenades. Three 9-pound guns on the quarter-deck (the rear part of the upper deck) were still usable, although one was on the wrong side, and had to be dragged around. Two of these guns were loaded with anti-personnel grapeshot to help drive Pearson’s men from the deck, but the third was used with solid bar-shot (see Naval Artillery page) aimed at Serapis’ main-mast.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the night}} of September 24, 1939 after unprecedentedly hot summer, Santa Monica Bay {{was hit by a}} severe storm, gales {{reaching}} [...] At the time, captain Olaf A. Olsen, five other crew members were on board together with an unidentified number of guests. Anchored at the bay, the Minnie A. Caine was riding out the storm six miles off the Santa Monica pier. When the old anchor chain failed the crew was too slow to cast the <b>spare</b> <b>anchor,</b> and the former schooner was thrown onto the shore at [...] by the intersection of Sunset boulevard and then Roosevelt Highway (now Pacific Coast Highway, part of California State Route 1).|$|E
6000|$|... "As Lyon was {{cruising}} about," [...] he said, [...] "and his sloop was pitching her catheads under, {{this thing}} was washed upon a <b>spare</b> <b>anchor,</b> where it stuck. It's a queer flag. Can it have had any connection with the lugger?" ...|$|E
60|$|All {{afternoon}} the Dazzler pitched and rolled at her anchorage, and as evening {{drew on the}} wind deceitfully eased down. This, and the example set by French Pete, encouraged {{the rest of the}} oyster-boats to attempt to ride out the night; but they looked carefully to their moorings and put out <b>spare</b> <b>anchors.</b>|$|R
60|$|Tommy came, as {{he thought}} thus, upon an open space of ground on which were strewn <b>spare</b> <b>anchors</b> and chain cables. Tumbling over a fluke {{of one of the}} former he fell to the earth with a shock that well-nigh drove all the wind out of his stout little body. He was up in a moment, however, and off again.|$|R

60|$|The {{order was}} {{promptly}} obeyed, and the helm shoved hard a-port, {{but there was}} no responsive sheer. The sea was at the time currentless. Another moment and the vessel, which was a large deserted brig, struck the floating light on the port-bow, and her fore shrouds caught the fluke of the <b>spare</b> <b>anchor</b> which projected from the side.|$|E
60|$|French Pete {{scrambled}} forward like a cat, at {{the same}} time drawing his knife, with one stroke of which he severed the rope that held them to the <b>spare</b> <b>anchor.</b> This threw the whole weight of the Dazzler on the chain-anchor. In consequence she swung off to the left, and just in time; for the next instant, drifting stern foremost, the Ghost passed over the spot she had vacated.|$|E
60|$|The wreck {{was evidently}} a sailing vessel. Her masts were all gone, her bulwarks carried away, and she lay far heeled over. A {{group of people}} could be seen huddled up in the bow as they neared her. Tom Hoskins and Jack had {{for the last ten}} minutes been busy getting the <b>spare</b> <b>anchor</b> up on deck and {{fastening}} to it the wrap of the trawl-net, which was by far the strongest rope they had on board.|$|E
50|$|Flinders discovered, on {{departure}} {{during the}} morning of Saturday 21 May 1803, that HMS Investigator {{was in danger of}} being driven aground on Middle Island by a freshening breeze before the sails could be loosed. This danger was mitigated by using the sloop's <b>spare</b> <b>anchors</b> to hold it in place. However, Flinders needed to abandon the best bower anchor, a stream anchor, and a quantity of cable in order to safely depart from the bay. Instead of recovering the two anchors, HMS Investigator continued towards Port Jackson with the intention of retrieving these at a later time.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are as {{far out of}} the way as we are here, down on {{the coast}} of Spain! The truth is just this. The Seven Dollies was lying among the rest of them, at anchor, below Canton, with the weather as fine as young girls love to see it in May, when Joe began to get down his yards, to house his masts, and to send out all his <b>spare</b> <b>anchors.</b> He even went so far as to get two hawsers {{fastened}} to a junk that had grounded a little ahead of him. This made a talk among the captains of the vessels, and some came on board to ask the reason. Joe told them he was getting ready for the typhoon; but when they inquired his reasons for believing there was to be a typhoon at all, Joe looked solemn, shook his head, and said he had reasons enough, but they were his own. Had he been explicit, he would have been laughed at, but the sight of an old grey-headed man, who had been at sea forty years, getting ready in this serious manner, set the others at work too; for ships follow each other's movements, like sheep running through a breach in the fence. Well, that night the typhoon came in earnest, and it blew so hard, that Joe Bunk said he could see the houses in the moon, all the air having blown out of the atmosphere." ...|$|R
60|$|My {{ideas are}} cramped, you say?--Oh, I {{forgot to tell}} you that this home I am {{describing}} is to be a floating home, and that my wife and I are to journey around the world in it for the matter of seven years or more. I forgot also to state that there will be an engine-room in it for a seventy-horse-power engine, a dynamo, storage batteries, etc.; tanks for water to last long weeks at sea; space for fifteen hundred gallons of gasolene, fire extinguishers, and life-preservers; and a great store-room for food, <b>spare</b> sails, <b>anchors,</b> hawsers, tackles, and a thousand and one other things.|$|R
60|$|In an {{hour the}} Arato, moored by her <b>spare</b> <b>anchor,</b> {{lay in the}} little bay, less than two hundred yards from shore. It gave the shipwrecked men a wild delight to find {{themselves}} again upon the decks of a seaworthy vessel, and everybody worked with a will, especially the prisoner and Inkspot. And when the last sail had been furled, it became evident to all hands on board that they wanted their breakfast, and this need was speedily supplied by Maka and Inkspot from the Arato's stores.|$|E
60|$|The Scarecrow {{clapped his}} stuffed hands in glee {{as he saw}} his friend drawn from the water into the air; but the next moment the straw man was himself in the air, his stuffed legs kicking wildly; for the crows had flown {{straight}} up through the trees. On {{one end of the}} line dangled the Tin Woodman, hung by the neck, and on the other dangled the Scarecrow, hung by the waist and clinging fast to the <b>spare</b> <b>anchor</b> of the boat, which he had seized hoping to save himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not often," [...] replied Jim. [...] "Considering the {{constancy}} {{of their}} exposure {{to all sorts of}} weather, and the number of light-vessels afloat, it is amazin' how few accidents take place. There has been nothing of the kind as long as I can remember anything about the service, but my father has told me of a case where one of the light-vessels that marked a channel {{at the mouth of the}} Thames once broke adrift in a heavy gale. She managed to bring up again with her <b>spare</b> <b>anchor,</b> but did not dare to show her light, being out of her proper place, and therefore, a false guide. The consequence was that eight vessels, which were making for the channel, and counted on seeing her, went on the sands and were lost with nearly all hands." ...|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} October {{a violent}} gale almost wrecked Naiad near the Île de Ré. She sat for two days on shore under the guns of a French battery, which, much to the mystification of her captain and crew, did not fire on them. On the second day the French {{commander}} sent boats with <b>spare</b> cables and <b>anchors</b> and informed Wilkinson that England had signed the preliminaries of a peace treaty with France. Naiad then returned to Plymouth on 1 November.|$|R
5000|$|USN {{life rafts}} are stowed in {{heavy-duty}} fiberglass canisters {{and can be}} launched manually or automatically should the ship begin to sink. Automatic launching and inflation is actuated by a change in pressure sensed by a hydrostatic release device should the ship begin to sink. A hand pump is provided to [...] "top-off" [...] pressure at night when temperatures drop and internal air pressure decreases. Relief valves are installed in each tube to prevent overpressure. Repairs to holes or rips up to six inches in length can be made using special sealing clamps. Occupants in USN life rafts are protected from wind, rain and sun by built-in canopies which automatically inflate. Hatches are sealable to prevent rain and seawater from entering the life rafts. Survival equipment includes: manual reverse osmosis desalinator (MROD), bottles of fresh water, individual food packets, fishing kit, signaling mirror, rocket and smoke flares, flashlight, <b>spare</b> sea <b>anchor,</b> first aid kit, paddles, spare batteries and bulbs, and aluminized mylar sheets ("space blankets") to aid in caring for victims of hypothermia.|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} (October 12th), my men {{set to work}} making anchors and oars. The native Malay anchor is ingeniously {{constructed}} {{of a piece of}} tough forked timber, the fluke being strengthened by twisted rattans binding it to the stem, while the cross-piece is formed of a long flat stone, secured in the same manner. These anchors when well made, hold exceedingly arm, and, owing to the expense of iron, are still almost universally used on board the smaller praus. In the afternoon the head men arrived, and promised me as many rowers as I could put on the prau, and also brought me a few eggs and a little rice, which were very acceptable. On the 14th there was a north wind all day, which would have been invaluable to us a few days earlier, but which was now only tantalizing. On the 16th, all being ready, we started at daybreak with two new anchors and ten rowers, who understood their work. By evening we had come more than half-way to the point, and anchored for the night in a small bay. At three the next morning I ordered the anchor up, but the rattan cable parted close to the bottom, having been chafed by rocks, and we then lost our third anchor on this unfortunate voyage. The day was calm, and by noon we passed the southern point of Gilolo, which had delayed us eleven days, whereas the whole voyage during this monsoon should not have occupied more than half that time. Having got round the point our course was exactly in the opposite direction to what it had been, and now, as usual, the wind changed accordingly, coming from the north and north-west,--so that we still had to row every mile up to the village of Gani, which we did not reach till the evening of the 18th. A Bugis trader who was residing there, and the Senaji, or chief, were very kind; the former assisting me with a <b>spare</b> <b>anchor</b> and a cable, and making me a present of some vegetables, and the latter baking fresh sago cakes for my men; and giving rue a couple of fowls, a bottle of oil, and some pumpkins. As the weather was still very uncertain, I got four extra men to accompany me to Ternate, for which place we started on the afternoon of the 20th.|$|E
60|$|In the morning, {{finding it}} would be {{necessary}} for us to get round a rocky point, I wanted my men to go on shore and cut jungle-rope, by which to secure us from being again drafted away, as the wind was directly off shore. I unfortunately, however, allowed myself to be overruled by the pilot and crew, who all declared that it was the easiest thing possible, and that they would row the boat round the point in a few minutes. They accordingly got up the anchor, set the jib, and began rowing; but, just as I had feared, we drifted rapidly off shore, and had to drop anchor again in deeper water, and much farther off. The two best men, a Papuan and a Malay now swam on shore, each carrying a hatchet, and went into the jungle to seek creepers for rope. After about an hour our anchor loosed hold, and began to drag. This alarmed me greatly, and we let go our <b>spare</b> <b>anchor,</b> and, by running out all our cable, appeared tolerably secure again. We were now most anxious for the return of the men, and were going to fire our muskets to recall them, when we observed them on the beach, some way off, and almost immediately our anchors again slipped, and we drifted slowly away into deep water. We instantly seized the oars, but found we could not counteract the wind and current, and our frantic cries to the men were not heard till we had got a long way off; as they seemed to be hunting for shell-fish on the beach. Very soon, however, they stared at us, and in a few minutes seemed to comprehend their situation; for they rushed down into the water, as if to swim off, but again returned on shore, as if afraid to make the attempt. We had drawn up our anchors at first not to check our rowing; but now, finding we could do nothing, we let them both hang down by the full length of the cables. This stopped our way very much, and we drifted from shore very slowly, and hoped the men would hastily form a raft, or cut down a soft-wood tree, and paddle out, to us, as we were still not {{more than a third of}} a mile from shore. They seemed, however, to have half lost their senses, gesticulating wildly to us, running along the beach, then going unto the forest; and just when we thought they had prepared some mode of making an attempt to reach us, we saw the smoke of a fire they had made to cook their shell-fish! They had evidently given up all idea of coming after us, and we were obliged to look to our own position.|$|E
5000|$|The Ambrose was {{involved}} in a number of collisions during this time. In September 1935, she was rammed by the Grace Liner Santa Barbara, with both ships sustaining heavy damage. In January 1950, it was [...] "brushed" [...] in heavy fog by an unidentified vessel, suffering damage to the radio antenna and losing her <b>spare</b> <b>anchor.</b> Eleven weeks later in March the Santa Monica, another Grace Line vessel, rammed the Ambrose in a dense fog, rupturing her hull. She was later repaired, and redeployed to Portland, Maine. Retired from lightship duty in 1969, she passed through several owners before being sold for scrap in 1984.|$|E

5000|$|A popular {{feature is}} a [...] "Portuguese bridge", which {{consists}} of a walkway behind the foredeck, in front and to the sides of, the pilothouse windows, separated from the foredeck by a (generally) waist-high bulwark. The purpose of the bridge is to deflect green water from the foredeck up over the superstructure top rather than slamming against the forward windows of the pilothouse. It gives a semi-sheltered area outside the pilothouse while underway. A secondary benefit is that it provides a [...] "safe area" [...] or handhold when {{it is necessary to}} be on the foredeck in inclement weather. And lastly, it provides additional storage space for lines, fire extinguisher, <b>spare</b> <b>anchor,</b> drogue, etc., if the builder has provided access doors and lockers {{on the inside of the}} bridge.|$|E
5000|$|In April 1965, she was {{assigned}} to the [...] "Market Time" [...] operation along the coast of Vietnam, that was designed to interdict enemy infiltration and coastwise logistics operations. A South Vietnamese Navy patrol boat, RVNS PC-04, had caught an enemy [...] "trawler" [...] unloading weapons at Vung Ro, South Vietnam and there was growing concern with enemy coastal traffic. In July 1965, Tillamook entered Vung Ro about midnight based on reports from her Vietnamese liaison that a RVN outpost had been captured by the VC, the idea being to use Tillmook's 3 inch 50 single gun to attack the outpost. After slinking quietly in the cove, the Captain ordered the First Lieutenant to anchor, whereupon the First lieutenant opened the wrong pelican hook, sending the <b>spare</b> <b>anchor</b> splashing into the sea. With that, Tillamoook departed the cove without firing.|$|E
50|$|At 3:13 am on 8 December 1959, the Mona was {{launched}} {{to assist the}} North Carr Lightship, which was reported adrift in St Andrews Bay. Weather conditions were exceptionally severe, with a strong south-easterly gale, and the Broughty Ferry lifeboat was the only boat in the area able to launch. The Mona was seen clearing the Tay and heading south into St Andrews Bay. Her last radio message was at 4:48 am. As the Mona was struggling to reach the North Carr reef, {{off the coast of}} Fife, the lightship's crew of six were able to drop their <b>spare</b> <b>anchor.</b> They were all rescued alive and well by helicopter the next morning, 24 hours after the first call for help had gone out.
