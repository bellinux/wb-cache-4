50|$|In the Philippines, {{especially}} in Ilocano-dominated areas, this vegetable, locally known as <b>saluyot,</b> can be mixed with either bitter gourd, bamboo shoots, loofah, or sometimes all of them. These have a slimy and slippery texture.|$|E
50|$|In Philippine cuisine, the shoots are {{commonly}} called labóng (other names include rabong or rabung). The {{two most popular}} dishes for these are ginataáng labóng (shoots in coconut milk and chilies) and dinengdeng na labóng (shoots in fish bagoóng and stew of string beans, <b>saluyot,</b> and tinapa). Bamboo shoots are also preserved as atchara, traditional sweet pickles that are often made from papaya.|$|E
5000|$|Based {{from the}} info, Bardagul deduces that the {{perpetrator}} {{of the bombing}} in the mall is a woman named Lita (the one mentioned by the Ilocano-speaking man earlier) and the explosive used in the bombing is a pyrotechnic device from Bulacan. He then asks for the receipts and the leaf that is among the evidence. The receipts have names of restaurants in Quezon City specializing in Ilocano cuisine and all of which list a dish called [...] "inabraw nga saluyot." [...] The leaf {{happens to be a}} <b>saluyot</b> leaf, which is predominant in Ilocano dishes.|$|E

There, Bardagul {{discusses}} the confirmed doubt that Lita's (Kainam) actions against her father, Abraham, are just an inside job because their farms are {{right next to}} each other and both have <b>saluyot</b> planted on them. So to make sure, he asked Abraham and the other farmers' help in staking Lita. He also explains that Kainam collaborated with Lagumbay in his security business to create terrorist threats on malls, forcing the mall owners to hire more guards, and lose money in the process. He also finds out that Brossy was kidnapped because she was flirting with a security guard, just as he suspected. They then return to Manila, having finished their mission.|$|E
