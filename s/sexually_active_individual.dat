40|$|Based {{on popular}} media and AIDS {{education}} posters from Germany and Switzerland I distinguish two main phases within {{the history of}} AIDS in the 1980 s and 1990 s. The first of them comprises the period {{from the beginning of}} the so-called »AIDS crisis« to the mid- 1980 s, during which AIDS was constructed as a disease of the (sexual) other. In this context of sexist, racist, and classist discourses about »the plague«, a con- nection of AIDS and male homosexuality came to the fore that was unknown in the 1970 s debate on the recurrence of infectious diseases. The second phase began around 1985 when the focus of the AIDS prevention programs was gradually shifted from »risk groups« to »risk behavior« – not least in response to the harsh criticism raised by grass- roots groups. This transformation, I argue, came along with a re-subjectivation of the <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> <b>individual</b> as self-reliant and socially responsible. Furthermore, the emer- gence of the risk discourse was accompanied by an iconography of a healthy and athletic »prevention body«. Since the early 1990 s it increasingly replaced the haggard and dis- eased »AIDS body« that had dominated the iconography of AIDS throughout the previous decade...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: If sexual compulsivity {{and other}} {{addictive}} behaviours share common aetiology, contemporary proposals {{about the role}} of attentional processes in understanding addictive behaviours are relevant. METHODS: To examine attentional biases for sex-related words among <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> <b>individuals</b> and the relationship between sexual compulsivity and sexual behavioural engagement with attentional bias, 55 <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> <b>individuals</b> completed a modified Stroop task and the sexual compulsivity scale. RESULTS: Findings showed attentional bias towards sex-related stimuli among <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> participants. In addition, among those with low levels of sexual compulsivity, levels of attentional bias were the same across all levels of sexual experience. Among those with higher levels of sexual compulsivity, greater attentional bias was linked with lower levels of sexual experience.

Material and Methods: During February 2004, a cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted. The research tool was an unidentified 20 -item questionnaire addressing the sexual behavior of study subjects and their partners and methods of protection from STIs. Descriptive statistics and χ 2 – test were used for data analysis. Results: The response rate was 84. 2 % (278 / 330). A total of 278 subjects, 96 (34. 5 %) males and 182 (65. 5 %) females, 167 (60. 1 %) married and 111 (39. 9 %) single, mean age 31. 3 ± 8. 4, age range 18 - 52 years were enrolled in the study. Study results revealed 22. 3 % (62 / 278) subjects to have had two or more sexual partners over the one-year period and the use of condom was reported by 40. 3 % (25 / 62) of those subjects.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{incidence}} and antibiotic sensitivity of Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis strains cultured from the genital discharges of <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> <b>individuals</b> who attended our STD outpatient service. Samples were taken with universal swab (Biolab®, Budapest, Hungary) into the Urea-Myco DUO kit (Bio-Rad®, Budapest, Hungary) and incubated in ambient air for 48 h at 37  °C. The determination of antibiotic sensitivity was performed in U 9 and arginin broth using the SIR Mycoplasma kit (Bio-Rad®, Budapest, Hungary) under the same conditions. Between 01. 05. 2008 and 31. 12. 2011, 373 / 4, 466 (8. 35  %) genito-urethral samples with U. urealyticum and 41 / 4, 466 (0. 91  %) genito-urethral samples with M. hominis infection were diagnosed in <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> <b>individuals</b> in the National STD Center, Semmelweis University. U. urealyticum was isolated in 12. 54  % in the cervix and 4. 1  % in the male urethra, while M. hominis was isolated in 1. 33  % in the cervix and 0. 51  % in the male urethra. The affected age group was between 21 and 60 years old. U. urealyticum strains were sensitive to tetracycline (95. 9  %), doxycycline (97. 32  %), and azithromycin (85. 79  %), and resistant to erythromycin (81. 23  %), clindamycin (75. 06  %), and ofloxacin (25. 2  %).

40|$|Models of HIV {{transmission}} and the AIDS epidemic generally assume random mixing among those infected with HIV {{and those who}} are not. For sexually transmitted HIV, this implies that individuals select sex partners without regard to attributes such as familiarity, attractiveness, or risk of infection. This paper formulates a model for examining the impact of nonrandom mixing on HIV transmission. We present threshold conditions that determine when HIV epidemics can occur within the framework of this model. Nonrandom mixing is introduced by assuming that <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> <b>individuals</b> select sex partners to minimize the risk of infection. In addition to variability in risky sex rates, some versions of our model allow for error (or noise) in information exchanged between prospective partners.

In 1981 the incidence of gonorrhoea started to decrease, thus preceding the onset of the AIDS epidemic in The Netherlands. Since 1983 the decline in gonorrhoea further accelerated and has been most apparent among homo- and bisexual men, presumably as a result of behavioural changes because of AIDS. There is less evidence for massive (AIDS related) behavioural changes among heterosexuals.

40|$|Abstract HPV {{infection}} in the genital tract is common in young <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> <b>individuals,</b> the majority of whom clear the infection without overt clinical disease. However {{most of those who}} develop benign lesions eventually mount an effective cell mediated immune (CMI) response and the lesions regress. Failure to develop effective CMI to clear or control infection results in persistent infection and, {{in the case of the}} oncogenic HPVs, an increased probability of progression to CIN 3 and invasive carcinoma. The prolonged duration of infection associated with HPV seems to be associated with effective evasion of innate immunity thus delaying the activation of adaptive immunity. Natural infections in animals show that neutralising antibody to the virus coat protein L 1 is protective suggesting that this would be an effective prophylactic vaccine strategy. The current prophylactic HPV VLP vaccines are delivered i. m. circumventing the intra-epithelial immune evasion strategies. These vaccines generate high levels of antibody and both serological and B cell memory as evidenced by persistence of antibody and robust recall responses. However there is no immune correlate - no antibody level that correlates with protection. Recent data on how HPV infects basal epithelial cells and how antibody can prevent this provides a mechanistic explanation for the effectiveness of HPV VLP vaccines. </p...|$|R
40|$|Toxoplasmic {{encephalitis}} is {{the most}} common cerebral mass lesion in patients with AIDS. The definitive diagnosis requires direct demonstration of the tachyzoite form of Toxoplasma gondii in cerebral tissue. The presumptive diagnosis is based on serology, clinical and radiological features, and on response to anti-Toxoplasma therapy. Typically, patients have a subacute presentation of focal neurological signs, with multiple lesions in computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, the neurological and CT scan spectrum is broad. We report a case of toxoplasmic encephalitis in a heterosexual man without prior history of HIV infection. He was admitted with four days of headache, confusion, and new onset of seizures. His brain CT disclosed no alterations and MRI revealed multiple lesions. Empirical specific anti-Toxoplasma therapy was initiated and the patient experienced excellent clinical and radiological improvement. His HIV tests were positive and the CD 4 + cell count was 74 cells/ml (8. 5 %). On follow up, three months later, the general state of the patient was good, without neurological sequelae and with a normal MRI.

In 2009, 1145 <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> <b>individuals</b> aged 18 - 65 years were surveyed online, after being recruited via an e-mail message circulated at a large Croatian university and posted on various social networking websites. Participants' mean age was 28. 1 years (SDÂ =Â  8. 01). Women constituted a slight majority of the sample (51. 6 %). The research questions - whether the frequently observed association between condom use at first and most recent sexual intercourse could be best predicted by (a) norm-oriented behavior; (b) calculative decision-making; or (c) habit formation - were tested using multiple logistic regression. Only the calculative and habitual motivational determinants of condom use were significant predictors. Unlike calculative use, which decreased the odds of condoms being used at both occasions, habitual use, as expected, increased the odds of condom use. In addition, the habitual modality of condom use significantly predicted consistent condom use with both casual and steady sexual partners. Age, being in a relationship, and the number of lifetime sexual partners were negatively associated with habitual condom use. The finding that habit plays a substantial role in consistent condom use suggests the need for further exploration of personality and relational factors associated with the initiation of habitual condom use.

Potential condom outlets (n = 281) were mapped and surveyed, and questionnaires on condom access and use (n = 630) were administered to a random sample of men and women aged 15 - 49. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess the relative roles of supply-side and demand-side barriers on condom use. RESULTS: the median straight-line distance to free condoms was 18 -fold higher in the rural versus urban site. Among <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> respondents, 42 % had ever used a condom, and 23 % had used a condom over the past 12 months, with lower levels among rural versus urban respondents (P < 0. 05). The mean number of condoms used was 2. 2 /person per year among all <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> <b>individuals</b> (condom users and nonusers), amounting to 8. 2 % protected sex acts/person per year. The adjusted odds of condom use (past 12 months) were 8. 1 times greater among individuals experiencing no supply-side or demand-side barriers, compared with individuals experiencing both types of barriers. Despite low levels of usage and the presence of supply-side and demand-side barriers, reported unmet need for condoms was low. CONCLUSIONS: there is an urgent need for renewed condom promotion efforts aimed at building demand, in addition to improving physical access, in resource-limited settings with generalized HIV epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa...|$|R
5000|$|Young {{people in}} the U.S. are no more <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> than <b>individuals</b> in other {{developed}} countries, but they are significantly less knowledgeable about contraception and safe sex practices. As of 2006, only twenty states required sex education in schools - of these, only ten required information about contraception. [...] On the whole, less than 10% of American students receive sex education that includes topical coverage of abortion, homosexuality, relationships, pregnancy, and STI prevention. [...] Abstinence-only education was used {{throughout much of the}} United States in the 1990s and early 2000s. [...] Based upon the moral principle that sex outside of marriage is unacceptable, the programs often misled students about their rights to have sex, the consequences, and prevention of pregnancy and STIs.|$|R
40|$|This paper evaluates an {{experiment}} in which individuals in rural Malawi were randomly assigned monetary incentives to learn their HIV results after being tested. Distance to the HIV results centers was also randomly assigned. Without any incentive, 34 {{percent of the participants}} learned their HIV results. However, even the smallest incentive doubled that share. Using the randomly assigned incentives and distance from results centers as instruments for the knowledge of HIV status, <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> HIV-positive <b>individuals</b> who learned their results are {{three times more likely to}} purchase condoms two months later than <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> HIV-positive <b>individuals</b> who did not learn their results; however, HIV-positive individuals who learned their results purchase only two additional condoms than those who did not. There is no significant effect of learning HIV-negative status on the purchase of condoms. (JEL I 12, O 15) Over the past two decades, the HIV/AIDS epidemic has afflicted millions of individuals in Africa. In the absence of significantly expanded prevention and treatment programs, the epidemic is expected to worsen in many other parts of the world. One intervention often suggested to alleviate the spread of the disease is HIV testing, and some have gone so far as to say that voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) is the “missing weapon in the battle against AIDS. ” 1 Under the assumption that HIV testing is an effective prevention strategy, many international organizations and governments have called for increased investments in counseling and testing, requiring large amounts of monetary and human resources (Global Business Coalition 2005; Know hiv aids 2005). For example, in South Africa, government expenditures on counseling and testing increased from $ 2. 4 million in 2000 to $ 17. 3 million i...|$|R
40|$|Phenotypic {{plasticity}} can be adaptive when phenotypes {{are closely}} matched {{to changes in}} the environment. In crickets, rhythmic fluctuations in the biotic and abiotic environment regularly result in diel rhythms in density of <b>sexually</b> <b>active</b> <b>individuals.</b> Given that density strongly influences the intensity of sexual selection, we asked whether crickets exhibit plasticity in signaling behavior that aligns with these rhythmic fluctuations in the socio-sexual environment. We quantified the acoustic mate signaling behavior of wild-caught males of two cricket species, Gryllus veletis and G. pennsylvanicus. Crickets exhibited phenotypically plastic mate signaling behavior, with most males signaling more often and more attractively during the times of day when mating activity is highest in the wild. Most male G. pennsylvanicus chirped more often and louder, with shorter interpulse durations, pulse periods, chirp durations, and interchirp durations, and at slightly higher carrier frequencies {{during the time of the}} day that mating activity is highest in the wild. Similarly, most male G. veletis chirped more often, with more pulses per chirp, longer interpulse durations, pulse periods, and chirp durations, shorter interchirp durations, and at lower carrier frequencies during the time of peak mating activity in the wild. Among-male variation in signaling plasticity was high, with some males signaling in an apparently maladaptive manner. Body size explained some of the among-male variation in G. pennsylvanicus plasticity but not G. veletis plasticity. Overall, our findings suggest that crickets exhibit phenotypically plastic mate attraction signals that closely match the fluctuating socio-sexual context they experience...|$|R
