40|$|Abstract:- The {{potential}} of the thermal reverse flow reactor for reducing the methane emission has been demonstrated, but the further optimization of the structure parameters and operation parameters of the reactor is necessary because the intrinsic feedback of heat {{gives rise to a}} complex dynamic behavior. The effects of <b>switch</b> <b>time</b> and velocity on the stability of the reactor were studied experimentally using the presented pilot scale reactor. Emphasis was the effect of <b>switch</b> <b>time</b> from a perspective of minimizing the thermal energy loss to the outlet stream. Based on detailed analyses, it was found that for the lower velocity, the longer <b>switch</b> <b>time</b> should be used, on the other hand, for the higher velocity, the shorter <b>switch</b> <b>time</b> should be used. Further, for a given reacting section length, the production of velocity and <b>switch</b> <b>time</b> is a constant.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} time-optimal motions for a mobile platform in a planar environment. The platform has two nonsteerable, independently driven wheels. The overall mission of the robot is {{expressed in terms of}} a sequence of via points at which the platform must be at rest in a given configuration (position and orientation). The objective is to plan time-optimal trajectories between these configurations, assuming an unobstructed environment. Using Pontryagin’s maximum principle (PMP), we formally demonstrate that all time-optimal motions of the platform for this problem occur for bang-bang controls on the wheels (at each instant, the acceleration on each wheel is at either its upper or its lower limit). The PMP, however, provides only the conditions necessary for time optimality. To find the time-optimal robot trajectories, we first parameterize the bang-bang trajectories using the <b>switch</b> <b>times</b> on the wheels (the times at which the wheel accelerations change sign). With this param-eterization, we can fully search the robot trajectory space and find the <b>switch</b> <b>times</b> that will produce particular paths to a desired final configuration of the platform. We show numer-ically that robot trajectories with three <b>switch</b> <b>times</b> (two on one wheel and one on the other) can reach any position, while trajectories with four <b>switch</b> <b>times</b> can reach any configuration. By numerical comparison with other trajectories involving sim-ilar or greater numbers of <b>switch</b> <b>times,</b> we then identify the sets of time-optimal trajectories. These are uniquely defined using ranges of the parameters and consist of subsets of trajec-tories with three <b>switch</b> <b>times</b> (for the problem when the final orientation of the robot is not specified) or four <b>switch</b> <b>times</b> (when a full final configuration is specified). We conclude with a description of the use of the method for trajectory planning for one of our robots and discuss some comparisons of sample time-optimal paths with minimum length paths. 1...|$|R
