40|$|For highדּpeed networks, it is {{important}} that <b>fault</b> <b>management</b> be proactive [...] i. e., detect, diagnose, and mitigate problems before they result in severe degradation of network performance. Proactive fault manageשּׂent depends on monitoring the network to obtain the data on which to base manager decisions. However, monitoring introduces additional overhead that may itself degrade network performance especially when the network is in a stressed state. Thus, a tradeoff must be made be﫠tween the amount of data collected and transferred on one hand, and the speed and accuracy of fault detection and diagnosis on the other hand. Such a tradeoff can be naturally formulated as a Partially Observable Markov decision process (POMDP).

The need for <b>fault</b> <b>management</b> capabilities for improving network reliability {{is critical to}} rectify these faults. Current communication networks are moving towards the distributed computing environment enabling these networks to transport heterogeneous multimedia information across end to end connections. An advanced <b>fault</b> <b>management</b> system is thus required for such communication networks. <b>Fault</b> <b>Management</b> provides information {{on the status of}} the network by locating, detecting, identifying, isolating, and correcting network problems thereby increasing network reliability.

TINA also defines a Management Architecture that follows the functional area organization defined in the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) <b>Management</b> Framework, namely <b>fault,</b> configuration, accounting, performance, and security management (FCAPS).
