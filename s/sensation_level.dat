The noise level is close to and usually somewhat louder than the perceived loudness of the tinnitus.

40|$|Cortical {{auditory}} evoked potentials (CAEPs) are {{an emerging}} tool for hearing aid fitting evaluation in young children who cannot provide reliable behavioral feedback. It is therefore useful to determine {{the relationship between the}} <b>sensation</b> <b>level</b> of speech sounds and the detection sensitivity of CAEPs, which is the ratio between the number of detections and the sum of detections and non-detections. Twenty-five sensorineurally hearing impaired infants with an age range of 8 to 30 months were tested once, 18 aided and 7 unaided. First, behavioral thresholds of speech stimuli /m/, /g/, and /t/ were determined using visual reinforcement orientation audiometry. Afterwards, the same speech stimuli were presented at 55, 65, and 75 dB sound pressure level, and CAEPs were recorded. An automatic statistical detection paradigm was used for CAEP detection. For sensation levels above 0, 10, and 20 dB respectively, detection sensitivities were equal to 72 ± 10, 75 ± 10, and 78 ± 12 %.

Interaural time or level differences, {{a combination of these}} differences, and filtering with head-related transfer functions were applied to broadband noise bursts, to establish lateralization in quiet at center and right positions in the lateral plane. While applying these interaural differences, the subjects' ability to accurately align the noise's onset to the meter of a regular series of diotic reference onsets was investigated for various signal-to-noise ratios. At high target <b>sensation</b> <b>levels,</b> mean onset positions were close to physical isochrony and no systematic differences in temporal positioning due to different interaural cues were observed. At low target <b>sensation</b> <b>levels,</b> positioning accuracy decreased with a decreasing signal-to-noise ratio, and dichotic targets were positioned less accurately than diotic targets. This reduced temporal positioning accuracy could not be attributed to differences in detectability of the targets just above the threshold, nor to a reduction of effective target bandwidth of dichotic broadband targets.

Such models intend to contribute to a deep comprehension of the perception or recognition mechanism which permits listeners to decide whether a source of a sound is located on the right or {{on the left side of}} their medial plane. Methods Numerous lateralization judgments are accomplished through a computer controlled experiment set-up in order to investigate the transduction mechanism beneath them. The statistical treatment of the psychoacoustic data obtained has been performed by Two and Three Factors – Probit (Probability Unit) Analysis.

40|$|Background: Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that cortical auditory-evoked potentials (CAEPs) can be reliably elicited in response to speech stimuli in listeners wearing hearing aids. It is unclear, however, how close to the aided behavioral threshold (i. e., at what behavioral <b>sensation</b> <b>level)</b> a sound must be before a cortical response can reliably be detected. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study was}} to systematically examine the relationship between CAEP detection and the audibility of speech sounds (as measured behaviorally), when the listener is wearing a hearing aid fitted to prescriptive targets. A secondary aim was to investigate whether CAEP detection is affected by varying the frequency emphasis of stimuli, so as to simulate variations to the prescribed gain-frequency response of a hearing aid. The results have direct implications for the evaluation of hearing aid fittings in nonresponsive adult clients, and indirect implications for the evaluation of hearing aid fittings in infants. Research Design: Participants wore hearing aids while listening to speech sounds presented in a sound field. Aided thresholds were measured, and cortical responses evoked, under a range of stimulus conditions. The presence or absence of CAEPs was determined by an automated statistic. Study Sample: Participants were adults (6 females and 4 males). Participants had sensorineural hearing loss ranging from mild to severe-profound in degree. Data Collection and Analysis: Participants' own hearing aids were replaced with a test hearing aid, with linear processing, during assessments. Pure-tone thresholds and hearing aid gain measurements were obtained, and a theoretical prediction of speech stimulus audibility for each participant (similar to those used for audibility predictions in infant hearing aid fittings) was calculated. Three speech stimuli, (/m/, /t/, and /g/) were presented aided (monaurally, nontest ear occluded), free field, under three conditions (+ 4 dB/octave, − 4 dB/octave, and without filtering), at levels of 40, 50, and 60 dB SPL (measured for the unfiltered condition). Behavioral thresholds were obtained, and CAEP recordings were made using these stimuli. The interaction of hearing loss, presentation levels, and filtering conditions resulted in a range of CAEP test behavioral sensation levels (SLs), from − 25 to + 40 dB. Results: Statistically significant CAEPs (p 10 dB, and for only 5 % of occasions when the <b>sensation</b> <b>level</b> was negative.

This indicates that recruitment for loudness growth must be occurring much more in impaired ear. This is due to abnormality in cochlea such as hypersensitivity of haircells due to damage.

For infants with a sensory/neural hearing loss (SNHL), the audiogram can be estimated objectively using auditory brainstem response (ABR) testing and hearing aids prescribed accordingly. However, for infants with auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD) due to the abnormal/absent ABR waveforms, alternative measures of auditory function are needed to assess the need for amplification and evaluate whether aided benefit has been achieved. Cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs) are used to assess aided benefit in infants with hearing loss; however, there is insufficient information regarding the relationship between stimulus audibility and CAEP detection rates. It is also not clear whether CAEP detection rates differ between infants with SNHL and infants with ANSD.

40|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} showed that acute vascular responses to hand-transmitted vibration depend on the magnitude, the frequency, and the duration of the vibration but the mechanisms involved in the immediate vasoconstriction on exposure to vibration are not clear. This research was designed to advance understanding of the relation between the characteristics of vibration and changes in vascular circulation on exposed hands, and to develop a model of the mechanoreceptor channel involved in mediating vascular changes during vibration. Study 1 was designed to determine an appropriate temperature for investigating changes in finger circulation induced by hand-transmitted vibration. Subjects were exposed to vibration with two room temperatures (20 °C and 28 °C). The reduction in absolute finger blood flow was greater with the higher room temperature, but the percentage reduction in finger blood flow relative to FBF during pre-exposure to vibration was similar. The room temperature was then setting up at 25 °C to maintain suitable absolute finger blood flow value and obtain clear reduction pattern for digits circulation during vibration exposure. Three experiments were designed to investigate the role of the Pacinian channel in mediating vasoconstriction in the fingers during exposure to 125 -Hz vibration. In study 2, the association between vibration-induced reductions in finger blood flow and vibrotactile perception thresholds was investigated. Thresholds for the perception of 125 -Hz vibration were measured on the thenar eminence of the right hand and then changes in finger blood flow were measured when exposed to vibration (125 -Hz at 0. 5 and 1. 5 ms- 2 r. m. s.). When the vibration magnitude was greater than individual vibration thresholds, vasoconstriction was correlated with thresholds at both vibration magnitudes. In study 3, the relation between thresholds and vasoconstriction was investigated with 125 -Hz vibration and two contactors: 3 -mm and 6 -mm diameter probes. Subjects provided thresholds for perceiving vibration with both contact areas. With the magnitude of vibration 15 dB above each individual’s threshold with the 3 -mm probe, the reduction in FBF with the 6 -mm probe was greater than with the 3 -mm probe. There were similar reductions in finger circulation when vibration was presented by the two sizes of contactor at the same <b>sensation</b> <b>level.</b> In study 4, the relationship between 125 -Hz perception thresholds and vascular changes was investigated by applying vibration to different body locations. Vibration (125 -Hz 15 dB above the individual threshold at the right thenar eminence) was applied to three body locations: right index finger, right thenar eminence, and left thenar eminence. Differences in reductions in finger blood flow caused by vibration at each location were correlated with differences in thresholds: subjects with a greater difference in threshold between fingertip and thenar eminence showed a greater difference in the vascular changes when vibration was applied to the fingertip and the thenar eminence. Study 5 investigated the role of the Pacinian channel in mediating vascular responses to vibration at different frequencies of vibration. Subjects were exposed to 10 magnitudes of vibration (from - 10 dB to 40 dB <b>sensation</b> <b>level)</b> at 8, 16, 31. 5, 63, 125, and 250 Hz. Finger blood flow was reduced by 63 -, 125 -, and 250 -Hz vibration when the vibration magnitude reached a <b>sensation</b> <b>level</b> of 10 dB. With 8 -, 16 - and 31. 5 -Hzvibration, 25 dB <b>sensation</b> <b>level</b> was required to cause vasoconstriction. It is concluded that acute reductions in finger blood flow during vibration are mediated by the Pacinian channel through the sympathetic nervous reflex. The differences in the reductions in finger blood flow induced by vibration when exposed to different contact areas, body locations, and frequencies reflect the variation of the sensitivity of the Pacinian channel due to its characteristics (i. e., spatial summation, receptor density, frequency-dependent sensitivity) ...|$|E

The research was aimed to identify the effect of hypnosis in reducing the pain sensation of orthopedic post-operative patients. This quasy-experimental study involved 32 respondents, 16 respondents for each control and intervention group. The pain was measured by numeric pain intensity scale of 0 to 5. The hypnotherapy procedure was conducted using a cassette-recorder. The data were undertaken directly by the researcher at two hospitals. Independent t-test showed {{that there was a}} significant average deviation of the pain <b>sensation</b> <b>level</b> in the pre and post therapy from both groups (P = 0. 020, = 0. 05). However, the average deviation of pain <b>sensation</b> <b>level</b> of the intervention group was greater than the control group. The same result was obtained with paired t-test sample. There was a significant average deviation of pain sensation levels in the pre and post therapy for both groups (p = 0. 000, = 0. 05). The combination therapy between analgesic and hypnotherapy was more effective in reducing the level of orthopedic postoperative pain sensation than the single therapy. Terapi hipnosis belum banyak dikenal dan dikembangkan sebagai terapi keperawatan di Indonesia. Penelitian kuasi eksperimen ini bertujuan mengidentifikasi pengaruh hipnosis dalam menurunkan sensasi nyeri pasien pascabedah ortopedi. Sampel penelitian sebanyak 32 responden, terdiri dari 16 responden pada kelompok kontrol dan intervensi. Nyeri diukur dengan numeric pain intensity scale skala 0 - 5. Prosedur terapi hipnosis dikembangkan dalam bentuk rekaman pita kaset. Pengumpulan data dilakukan di dua rumah sakit. Hasil uji dengan independent t-test menunjukkan ada perbedaan signifikan rerata selisih tingkat sensasi nyeri sebelum dan setelah terapi baik pada kelompok kontrol dan intervensi (p = 0, 020, = 0, 05). Kelompok intervensi mempunyai rerata selisih tingkat sensasi nyeri yang lebih besar dari kelompok kontrol. Hasil yang sama juga ditunjukkan dengan paired sample t-test bahwa ada perbedaan signifikan rerata tingkat sensasi nyeri sebelum dan setelah terapi pada kelompok kontrol dan intervensi (p = 0, 000, = 0, 05). Kombinasi terapi analgesik dan hipnosis lebih efektif dibandingkan analgesik sebagai terapi tunggal untuk menurunkan tingkat sensasi nyeri pascabedah ortopedi...|$|E
40|$|A 62 year-old {{white female}} {{presented}} with a 10 -year-history of slowly progressive spastic paraparesis, pain and dysesthesia in the lower limbs and sphincter disturbance. A few years after {{the onset of the}} neurologic symptoms she developped migratory arthritis with swelling of the knees and pain on palpation of knees and fingers, dry eyes, mouth and skin. Two months before admission she presented bilateral nongranulomatous anterior uveitis. Examination revealed spastic paraparesis with bilateral Babinski sign, a decreased <b>sensation</b> <b>level</b> below L 3, decreased vibration sense in the lower extremities, and a postural tremor of the upper limbs. Laboratory work-up disclosed HTLV-I positive tests in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and a mild pleocytosis in the CSF with a normal protein content. Nerve conduction velocity studies were normal. The present case shows the association of uveitis, arthritis and Sjögren's syndrome in a patient with tropical spastic paraparesis / human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) associated myelopathy (TSP/HAM), and illustrates the wide spectrum of clinical manifestations which may accompany this infection with this virus...|$|E

40|$|High {{sensation}} seekers have unusual creativities. Recent years Furnham Adrian et al, {{found that}} the groups have different arts tendency have higher difference in Sensation seeking dimension than in Big 5. Some studies found arts students have higher level in many dimension. Sensation seeking has an important influence to peoples` aesthetic conception. This thesis measured art (including painting, music, dancing) students and non-art students` trait of sensation seeking Personality, and looked for {{the similarities and differences}} between art students and non-art students in development of sensation seeking personality. Try to find the influence of different procession of art study to <b>sensation</b> seeking <b>level.</b> The outcome of this study: 1. In non-art students, <b>sensation</b> seeking <b>level</b> has a decrease from Grade 1 to Grade 3 in college students, especially in males. Male has higher <b>sensation</b> seeking <b>level</b> than female, especially in TAS, DIS and GEN. 2. There are differences between art students and non-art students in sensation seeking. In ES and GEN Painting students have higher level than non-art students, but in TAS dancing students have lower level than non-art students, in BS students studied in music have lower level than non-art students. 3. Tendency of arts development in art students and non-art students has difference from grade 1 to grade 3. Tendency in non-art students has a decrease, but in art students is not so obviously. The developments in TAS、ES、GEN of painting students, in ES、BS、GEN of dancing students, in TAS、ES、GEN of music major students have differences towards to non-art students. Different art studies have possibility to improve opening of experiment and normal <b>sensation</b> seeking <b>level.</b> All the Different art kinds may affect the development of ES and GEN, and ES and GEN may become commonness gradually within all kind art groups. But this commonness is not so notable in Grade 1 - 3. 4. Between different art kinds have differences. TAS Scores of dancing group is notably lower than scores of music and painting groups, score of painting group in ES BS and GEN is remarkably higher than that of music and dancing groups, and painting group in DIS has a higher score than music group and dancing group. Painting group has highest sensation seeking in all art kinds students, and dancing group has lowest score in TAS. 5. For female, development tendency of all art kinds dimensions have no remarkable difference, except DIS. Interaction in female DIS dimension may be aroused by scores increase of painting group. In other scores development tendency of different kinds arts have no notable difference. 高感觉寻求者可以表现出异乎寻常的创造力。近年来Furnham Adrian等人的研究发现，不同艺术倾向的人在感觉寻求量表上的差异比在大五人格量表的差异更大。有研究证明艺术学生在感觉寻求的多个维度上水平更高。感觉寻求对人的审美观具有重要的影响。 本研究以艺术类（绘画、音乐、舞蹈专业）大学生和普通大学生为研究对象，比较了艺术学生与普通学生的感觉寻求特点与发展趋势。尝试从感觉寻求的角度证明艺术学习与人格发展之间的相关性。 本研究得到的几点结论： 1. 普通学生的感觉寻求水平在大学 1 - 3 年级间呈下降趋势，其中男性下降较明显。平均得分男性高于女性，集中体现在TAS、DIS、GEN上。 2. 艺术专业学生与普通学生存在感觉寻求的差异。美术ES、GEN水平高于普通人，舞蹈TAS低于普通人，音乐BS低于普通人。 3. 艺术学生与普通学生在大学 1 - 3 年级间的感觉寻求发展趋势存在差异。普通人呈下降趋势，艺术专业均不存在明显下降。美术TAS、ES、GEN，舞蹈ES、BS、GEN，音乐TAS、ES、GEN的发展趋势与普通人存在差异。不同艺术专业均可能影响ES和GEN的发展，ES、GEN可能逐渐发展成为各艺术专业之间的共性。但这种共性在大学的 1 - 3 年级并不十分明显。 4. 不同艺术专业之间存在差异，舞蹈TAS得分显著低于美术和音乐；美术ES、BS和GEN得分显著高于舞蹈和音乐；美术DIS得分显著高于音乐，边缘显著高于舞蹈。美术是艺术中感觉寻求最高的专业，舞蹈是TAS得分最低的专业。 5. 不同艺术专业之间除了女性的DIS维度外，其余维度的发展趋势均没有显著差异。女性DIS维度的交互可能是由于美术专业得分提高引起。在其他得分上，不同艺术专业的发展趋势差异不明显...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a quantitative {{characterization of the}} instability that a human user often experiences while interacting with a virtual textured surface rendered with a force-reflecting haptic interface. First, we quantified the degree of stability/ instability during haptic texture rendering through psychophysical experiments. The stiffness of the virtual textured surface upon detection of instability was measured {{under a variety of}} experimental conditions using two texture rendering methods, two exploration modes, and various texture model parameters. We found that the range of stiffness values for stable texture rendering was quite limited. Second, we investigated the attributes of the proximal stimuli experienced by a human hand while exploring the virtual textured surface in an attempt to identify the sources of perceived instability. Position, force, and acceleration were measured and then analyzed in the frequency domain. The results were characterized by <b>sensation</b> <b>levels</b> in terms of spectral intensity in dB relative to the human detection threshold at the same frequency. We found that the spectral bands responsible for texture and instability perception were well separated in frequency such that they excited different mechanoreceptors and were, therefore, perceptually distinctive. Furthermore, we identified the high-frequency dynamics of the device to be a likely source of perceived instability. Our work has implications for displaying textured surfaces through a force feedback device in a virtual environment...|$|R
