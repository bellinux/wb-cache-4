40|$|Underwater {{ambient noise}} was {{investigated}} in the stream-mouths of Clear, Cub and Pelican Creeks. Noise levels were determined from 0. 1 to 10 KHz during periods of high stream discharge and wave action. Minimum noise levels could not be determined due to instrument noise interference. Two noise sources contributed to ambient pressure spectrum levels in the stream-mouths: (1) flow noise and/or bubbles, and (2) surf-beats. The former is mainly composed of frequencies below 4 KHz while the latter is above 5 KHz. Four cutthroat trout (Salmo clarki) sounds were recorded and analyzed. The 2 ̆ 7 thump 2 ̆ 7 sound occurred when fish were alarmed and gave a sudden tail-flip. The principal frequency was 150 Hz in the band from 100 to 200 Hz. The 2 ̆ 7 squawk 2 ̆ 7 sound had principal frequencies in the band from 600 to 850 Hz. The 2 ̆ 7 squeak 2 ̆ 7 sound was infrequent and usually of low intensity. A sound with maximum energy above 2 KHz was created when a trout <b>shifted</b> <b>bottom</b> materials while preparing a redd. The response to low frequency sound was tested with 29 cutthroat trout. The conditioned response technique was applied using shock or light as the unconditioned stimulus. A positive response was not readily obtained.

40|$|Relations {{between the}} bandgap and {{structural}} properties {{and composition of}} the M–Si–N nitridosilicates (M = alkali, alkaline earth or rare earth metal) have been obtained, using experimental data collected from literature; and qualitative models are presented to explain the observed trends. Compounds with {{a higher degree of}} condensation, i. e. a higher Si/N ratio, generally have longer M–N bonds and shorter Si–N bonds. The observations can be explained based on the effective charge of N, dependent on its coordination with Si (NSix). With increasing Si/N ratio the coordination number of N by Si increases, making the effective charge of the nitrogen atom less negative, resulting in a longer and less covalent M–N bond. This also shifts the N 2 p levels down in energy, lowering the top of the valence band (mainly composed of N orbitals); while decreasing the Si–N distance <b>shifts</b> the <b>bottom</b> of the conduction band (mainly composed of Si and M orbitals) upward.

30|$|In conclusion, our {{detailed}} shift-share analysis returns {{a number}} of important and novel results that can be summarised as follows: the improvements in educational attainment have sustained the shift from middling to top occupations, while the reallocation of workers across occupations within skill groups has led to a substantial shift from the middle to the bottom. Polarisation has occurred within non-graduates (although heavily skewed towards the bottom), but not within the graduate group. The decline in middling occupations is entirely accounted for by non-graduates who have both decreased in numbers and seen their employment become more concentrated at the bottom. In the 2000 s the share of native workers employed in low-pay occupations declined {{for the first time and}} graduates (both natives and immigrants) also saw their employment <b>shift</b> towards the <b>bottom.</b>|$|R

Over 3 years, we investigated how pollinator diversity contributes to the magnitude of pollination service through spatial complementarity and differential response to high winds in California almond orchards.

Where wild pollinators were present, they showed spatial complementarity to honey bees and visited the bottom tree sections more frequently. As wind speed increased, honey bees' spatial preference <b>shifted</b> toward the <b>bottom</b> tree sections. In high winds (> 2. 5 m s - 1), orchards with low pollinator diversity (honey bees only) received almost no flower visits.

40|$|Within the {{frameworks}} of spin-polaron {{concept and}} the spherically symmetric {{state for the}} antiferromagnetic spin background, the one-particle motion is studied for two-dimensional Kondo-lattice. The elemetary excitations are represented as a Bloch superposition of four one-site electron states: two local states- a bare electron state and a local spin-polaron of small radius, and two states of delocalized polarons which correspond to the coupling of local states to the antiferromagnetic spin wave with momentum Q=(pi,pi), so called Q-polarons. As a remarkable result we show that the lowest band of elementary excitations is essentially determined by Q-polaron states in strongly coupled regime. The account of Q-polarons <b>shifts</b> the band <b>bottom</b> from (pi,pi) to (0, 0). The spectral weight of a bare particle in the lowest band states can greatly differ from 1.

40|$|Broken spatial {{inversion}} symmetry in spin-orbital coupled systems {{leads to}} a mixing between orbitals with different parity, which results in unusual electronic structures and transport properties. We theoretically investigate the possibility of multipole ordering induced by a parity mixing. In particular, {{we focus on the}} system in which the parity mixing appears in a sublattice-dependent form. Starting from the periodic Anderson model with such a local parity mixing, we derive an extended Kondo lattice model with sublattice-dependent antisymmetric exchange couplings between itinerant electrons and localized spins. By the variational calculation, simulated annealing, and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that the model on a quasi-one-dimensional zig-zag lattice exhibits an odd-parity multipole order composed of magnetic toroidal and quadrupole components at and near half filling. The multipole order causes a band deformation with the band <b>bottom</b> <b>shift</b> and a magnetoelectric response.

The cycle of magnetic-field generation in this model can be represented in the form of sequency of processes. There are vortexes with azimuth axis, similar with Taylor vortex, close to the bottom of convection zone. This leads to the generation of twisted flux tubes because of screw dynamo. The growth of magnetic field causes emersion of U- loops. During the process of emersion and extraction azimuthal field of flux tubes converts to axial field, and reaches the surface as bipolar of sunspots with U-shaped configuration. Due to differential rotation residual bipolar fields stretch out to the surface toroidal field and are <b>shifted</b> to the <b>bottom</b> of the convective zone by means of meridional flow at high latitudes.

Productivity by phytoplankton in the river water was insignificant as was rcspira-tion in the <b>shifting</b> sand <b>bottom.</b> The river behaved as a heterotrophic stream because of suspended organic detritus in the water. A higher and more variable quantity of particulate detritus was present in the water during summer than winter. This seasonal diffcrcnce was attributed to stream dischargostrcam bed relationships and a more rapid decomposition of organic fragments at higher summer temperatures. The net annual productivities, determined by the cropping method, in Cal/cm 2 for trophic groups were: Podostemum 434, filter fccdcrs 16. 8, herbivores 6. 51, detritus feeders 1. 68, herbivore and detritus feeders 2. 78 (total primary consumer 27. 8), and carnivore 3. 66.

Direct correlation of planktonic foraminiferal and calcareous nannofossil zonations results in positioning the NP 9 /NP 10 zonal boundary within the top part of Zone P 6 a. Benthic foraminiferal assemblages in the two areas are diverse and very similar: 92 % of the more abundant species are observed at both s 1 tes. These sites were situated in the deeper parts of a NE-SW trending basin at a paleodepth of 500 - 700 m. The well-known deep-sea benthic extinction (within Zones P 6 a, NP 9) is easily recognized by the sudden disappearance of Gavelinella beccariiformis, Angulogavelinella avnimelechi, Pullenia coryelli and other species within a 50 Kyr. times pan. In contrast to deep ocean sites, simple diversity drops only 17 %, since the abundant shallow-water species in the assemblages are not affected. Post-extinction faunas are dominated by Nuttallides truempyi (up to 29 %). In addition to this species {{a number of other}} species occur which seem to invade the deeper parts of the basin from shallow waters, immediately after the extinction.
