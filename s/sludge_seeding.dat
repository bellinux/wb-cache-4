The addition of this AT sludge (1. 2 % 0. 5 % of total volatile solids) to methanogenic sludge enhanced the production of biogas. The optimum volume of the addi-tion and the pretreatment temperature of the AT sludge for optimum biogas production were 5 % (v/v) and 65 °C. Batch-fed anaerobic digestion was covered with the addition of various AT sludges. The AT sludge prepared with the AT <b>seed</b> <b>sludge</b> improved the biogas production by 2. 2 times relative to that from the sewage sludge addition. The addi-tion of <b>sludge</b> without AT <b>seed</b> <b>sludge</b> weakly enhanced biogas production. An aerobic thermophilic bacterium (strain AT 1) was isolated from the AT <b>seed</b> <b>sludge.</b> Strain AT 1 grew well in a synthetic medium. The production of biogas from the anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge was improved by the addition of 5 % (v/v) AT 1 bacterial culture compared with that from the sewage sludge addition. The addition of AT 1 culture reduced the volatile solids by 21 %, which was higher than the 12. 6 % achieved with the sewage sludge addition. The AT 1 bacterial culture enhanced the biogas production more than the AT <b>seed</b> <b>sludge.</b> The phy-logenetic analysis of the 16 S rRNA gene revealed that strain AT 1 is closely related to Geobacillus thermodenitrif-icans (100 % sequence similarity).

The present study investigated the influence of mixing the <b>seeding</b> <b>sludge</b> with clay minerals on the efficiency of raw sewage treatment in a pilot-scale model simulating UASB reactor. Kaolinite and montmorillonite are utilized in the present work as clay minerals, while organics (BOD and COD) and solids (SS and DS) are selected as assessment parameters of the treatment process. While the two UASB models constructed and operated within the work-frame of the present work are identical and operated under the same operation conditions and scenario, one of them was seeded with a mixture of sludge and kaolinite and the other was seeded with a mixture of sludge and montmorillonite.

However, most of these have not maintained the features that make the BOD 5 assay so relevant - {{a high level of}} substrate bio-oxidation and use of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) sludge as the biocatalyst. Two recently described ferricyanide-mediated (FM) -BOD assays, one for trade wastes and one for WWTP influents and treated effluents, satisfy these criteria and were investigated further here for their suitability for use with diverse biocatalysts. Both FM-BOD assays responded proportionately to increasing substrate concentration with sludges from 11 different WWTPs and temporally (months to years) using sludges from a single WWTP, confirming the broad applicability of both assays. Sludges from four WWTPs were selected as biocatalysts for each FM-BOD assay to compare FM-BOD equivalent values with BOD 5 (three different <b>sludge</b> <b>seeds)</b> measurements for 12 real wastewater samples (six per assay). Strong and significant relationships were established for both FM-BOD assays.

The reactor has been operating for 6 months. The <b>seed</b> <b>sludge</b> used to inoculate the NOSBR was investigated by molecular biological methods. The results give the first evidence regarding the presence of bacteria from the Nitrospira phylum in wastewater treatment systems. It is hypothesized that these bacteria are the unknown nitrite oxidizers in these processes...|$|R
40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the XXI century one of the main issues in the life of processing industries is the use of secondary resources. At that, the main factors are the desire to miti-gate the impact on the environment, on the one hand, and to receive new products additionally, on the other hand. This trend is of topical interest in the industries engaged in the processing of agricultural raw materials, since the so-called waste products are of biological origin and may be the initial material for the production of feed and, in some cases, food products. In the production of wines the main wastes are sweet and fermented grape pomace, yeast and racking <b>sludges,</b> grape <b>seed</b> and others. One of the new directions is the use of vegetative parts of the vine plant of a seasonal nature. These primarily include red vine leaves, which have a larg...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the effects of <b>seed</b> <b>sludge</b> properties and the selective sludge discharge method on aerobic granulation in biological wastewater treatment. Small-loose flocs and larger-denser flocs were separated from raw activated sludge by sedimentation in a settling column. The two types of sludge were used as seed biomass in two laboratory batch reactors for the granulation experiment. A fixed daily sludge discharge ratio of around 10 % of slow-settling sludge {{was applied to the}} two reactors. The results showed that aerobic granules could be formed in the reactors from both <b>seed</b> <b>sludge</b> of different structural and settling properties. The initial washout of small-loose sludge flocs during the start-up of the bioreactors {{did not appear to be}} a crucial factor for granulation. The key operating parameter was the daily discharge of relatively slow-settling biomass from the reactors. PCR-DGGE analysis showed insignificant differences between the bacterial communities of the mature granular sludge in the two reactors. It implied that continuous discharge of small and slow-settling flocs removed these competitors for substrate uptake from the system and hence made the substrate more available for large and compact flocs and granules. This selective sludge discharge facilitated the growth and accumulation of denser sludge in the reactor, leading to complete granulation. © 2010 Elsevier B. V.

The experiments were performed using different initial pHs (5.0, 5.5, 6.0 and 6.5) and SRTs (2, 4, 6 and 8  days). The initial pH was adjusted using 2  M hydrochloric acid (HCl), and the sludge retention times (SRT) were adjusted using a sludge-adding ratio {{according to the}} method described by Lee et al.

40|$|A dynamic {{mathematical}} model based on anaerobic digestion model no. 1 (ADM 1) {{was developed for}} accumulation (AC) system treating concentrated black water and faecal matter at different temperatures. The AC system was investigated {{for the treatment of}} waste(water) produced from the following systems: vacuum toilet for black water (VBW), vacuum toilet for faeces with urine separation (VF), dry toilet (DT), dry toilets for faeces with urine separation (DF), separated faecal matter from conventional black water by filter bag (FB). For evaluation of the AC system treating the proposed waste(water) sources at 20 and 35 °C, two options were studied: (1) The filling period of the AC system was constant for all waste(water) sources (either 1, 3 or 6 months) and for each period, the <b>seed</b> <b>sludge</b> volume was varied; (2) The volume of the AC system was constant for all proposed waste(water) sources. The results showed that the filling period of the AC system was the main parameter affecting the system performance, followed by operational temperature, while the increase of the <b>seed</b> <b>sludge</b> volume slightly enhanced the performance of the system. The model results indicated that the filling period of the AC system should be higher than 150 days for obtaining a stable performance. It was found that the hydrolysis of biodegradable particulate chemical oxygen demand (COD) is the rate limiting step, as volatile fatty acid concentration is very low in all experimental conditions...|$|R
40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} to study the response of different concentrations of treated petroleum <b>sludge</b> on <b>seed</b> germination, root and shoot length and tolerance of Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp. The biologically treated petroleum sludge with bacterial consortium showed 54. 8 % reduction in total petroleum hydrocarbons. Treated sludge was utilized with agricultural soil in known concentration {{for the assessment of}} growth of V. unguiculata. A remarkable absence of seed germination was observed at higher sludge concentration. The different concentrations of treated petroleum sludge showed severe decline on the length, weight and vigour index of the tested seedlings with increasing sludge concentrations. The results showed that the difference in rate of seed germination was significant among various concentrations. Under environmental stress condition, germination is the most critical phase of life cycle in crop plants. In this present study, the high oil content found to alter the osmotic relation between seed and water and thus reduce the amount of water absorbed. It was concluded that the concentration of nutrients and oil present in the treated sludge were toxic to the plant...|$|R

Waste cooking oil (hereby {{referred to as}} FOG) was separated using an oil remover, then precipitated FOG for 48  h to make particulate precipitation, after that filtered to remove bubbles and solid and then stored at 4  °C. The pretreated FOG with density of 0.928  g mL− 1 were used as the raw material for anaerobic fermentation. The <b>seed</b> <b>sludge</b> was obtained from an anaerobic digester that was used for treating WF at 35  °C.

30|$|Haandel et al. (1994) {{reported}} that SMA of sludge {{is a measure}} of specific COD digestion or biotransformation rate. The nature of sludge developed is affected by the nature of influent fed to reactor. Sludge from anaerobic digesters is reported to have SMA in the range of 0.01 – 0.04  g CH 4 -COD g− 1 VSS day− 1. Sludge from digester is usually used as <b>seed</b> <b>sludge</b> for reactors. During the operation of reactor, <b>seed</b> <b>sludge</b> accumulates methanogens and inert particles are washed out, increasing SMA of sludge. SMA of sludge at different stages of UASB operation has been reported by several investigators. An increase in SMA of poor quality digested sludge from 0.04 to 0.85  g CH 4 -COD g− 1 VSS day− 1 was reported when sludge was grown on VFA mixture for 6  weeks from start up of UASB (Zeeuw and Lettinga 1980). A high value of SMA reported by (Zeeuw and Lettinga 1980) was due to additional methane generation via carbon dioxide reduction with VFA mixture as substrate. SMA was reported to increase from 0.06  g CH 4 -COD g− 1 VSS day− 1 to 0.2  g CH 4 -COD g− 1 VSS day− 1 for UASB sludge developed from diluted digested manure. SMA of UASB sludge was reported in the range of 0.14 – 0.17  g CH 4 COD g− 1 VSS day− 1 after 8  months of operation of self-inoculated UASB reactor treating sewage (Barbosa and Anna 1989). Acetate is generally used as substrate for determination of SMA. Gradual increase in size of granular sludge on feeding with ethanol was reported by Kato et al. (1994).|$|R
40|$|Batch {{tests were}} carried out to study the {{possibility}} of hydrogen production from alkali-pretreated <b>sludge</b> without <b>seed</b> and the pH dependency of hydrogen fermentation from alkali-pretreated sludge. Experimental {{results showed that the}} sewage sludge with alkali-pretreatment could be successfully applied to biologically producing hydrogen without seed and extra-feed. The results also showed that the initial pH value of sewage sludge was an important factor throughout the hydrogen fermentation of alkali-pretreated sludge. The maximum hydrogen yield was obtained at initial pH value of 11. 0 (14. 4 mL. g VS- 1). The hydrogen yield of alkali-pretreated sludge at alkaline initial pH value was much higher than that of acidic or neutral initial pH value. The optimal pH value of hydrogen production from alkalipretreated sludge was approximately 9. 5. The consumption of hydrogen could be inhibited when the pH value of sludge was above 8. 5. The change of hydrogen yield at various initial pH values was similar to that of sludge SCOD. The change of sludge pH value was slow and acetate was the major component of volatile fatty acids produced in the process of hydrogen production. The yield and the constitution of volatile fatty acids were sensitive to the initial pH value...|$|R
40|$|The {{wastewater}} {{produced by}} food manufacturing industry {{is known for}} its high concentration of COD and suspended solid. In wastewater treatment, anaerobic process is favorable due to its low cost, biogas production, low sludge production and more. In this study, upflow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) and hybrid-UASB (HUASB) reactors, were combined with anaerobic filter (AF) bioreactors forming two stages system to treat food processing industry wastewater. This study was focused on the performance of UASB-AF (R 1) and HUASB-AF (R 2) treatment systems and the granules development. <b>Seed</b> <b>sludge</b> was deposited into HUASB column up to a third of the height. Palm oil shells were then packed into the HUASB (above <b>seed</b> <b>sludge)</b> as well as AF reactors to promote growth of microorganisms. The R 1 and R 2 systems were operated simultaneously, fed with raw food manufacturing wastewater taken from Azhar Food Manufacturing Factory. Parameters measured to evaluate the performance of the process were pH, COD, NH 3 -N, oil and grease and total phosphorus. The highest average COD removal efficiency, at 99 %, were detected in R 1 and R 2 systems, both at OLR 10. 56 g COD/L. d. Moreover, the presence of aggregated bio particles with diameter ranges from 2. 934 to 5. 00 mm were observed in both UASB and HUASB reactors. The highest percentage of 2. 934 to 5. 00 mm diameter granules were 7. 6 % and 10. 7 % in the UASB and HUASB respectively. In addition, the highest removal rate coefficient, k values for UASB and HUASB were 2. 1981 and 3. 3950, occurred at OLR 8. 59 and 10. 56 g COD/L. d, respectively. Overall, the k values have proved that HUASB reactor had performed better than UASB reactor...|$|R
