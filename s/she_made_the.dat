5|$|In {{the post-war}} period, {{following}} {{the invention of}} long-playing records, Tosca recordings were dominated by Maria Callas. In 1953, with conductor Victor de Sabata and the La Scala forces, <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> recording for EMI which for decades has been considered {{the best of all}} the recorded performances of the opera. She recorded the role again for EMI in stereo in 1964. A number of Callas's live stage performances of Tosca were also preserved.

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1944 at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, McClintock began {{systematic}} studies on the mechanisms of the mosaic color patterns of maize seed and the unstable inheritance of this mosaicism. She identified two new dominant and interacting genetic loci that she named Dissociator (Ds) and Activator (Ac). She found that the Dissociator did not just dissociate or cause the chromosome to break, it also had a variety of effects on neighboring genes when the Activator was also present, which included making certain stable mutations unstable. In early 1948, <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> surprising discovery that both Dissociator and Activator could transpose, or change position, on the chromosome.|$|E

5|$|Argus was recommissioned and {{partially}} modernised {{shortly before the}} Second World War {{and served as a}} training ship for deck-landing practice until June 1940. The following month <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>the</b> first of her many ferry trips to the Western Mediterranean to fly off fighters to Malta; she was largely occupied in this task for the next two years. The ship also delivered aircraft to Murmansk in Russia, Takoradi on the Gold Coast, and Reykjavík in Iceland. By 1942, the Royal Navy was very short of aircraft carriers and Argus was pressed into front-line service despite her lack of speed and armament. In June, she participated in Operation Harpoon, providing air cover for the Malta-bound convoy. In November, the ship provided air cover during Operation Torch, the invasion of French North Africa, and was lightly damaged by a bomb. After returning to the UK for repairs, Argus was used again for deck-landing practice until late September 1944. In December, she became an accommodation ship and was listed for disposal in mid-1946.
