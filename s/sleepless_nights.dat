5|$|Children {{were also}} {{affected}} through {{the loss of}} parents in the bombing. Many children lost one or more parents in the blast, with a reported seven children that lost their only remaining parent. Children of the disaster have been raised by single parents, foster parents, and other family members. Adjusting to the loss has made these children suffer psychologically and emotionally.

5|$|In Mumbai and Goa, Kaira (Alia Bhatt) is a {{promising}} cinematographer {{who wishes to}} direct her own films. Blunt and cynical, she is most comfortable when with her three best friends, Fatima (Ira Dubey), Jackie (Yashaswini Dayama) and Ganju (Gautmik). Kaira's life takes a downturn when Raghuvendra (Kunal Kapoor), a film producer for whom she breaks up with her childhood sweetheart, gets engaged to someone else. Her landlord turns {{her out of her}} apartment because the building association wants to rent apartments only to married couples. All this plus dissatisfaction with her prospects at work serves as a catalyst for her shift to Goa, where she now has to grudgingly live with her parents (Aban Deohans and Atul Kale) with whom she has some issues. She ends up spending many <b>sleepless</b> <b>nights</b> in unhappiness and uncertainty.|$|E
5|$|Pinfold is very {{protective}} of his privacy, but uncharacteristically agrees {{to be interviewed}} on BBC radio. The main inquisitor is a man named Angel, whose voice and manner disconcert Pinfold, who believes he detects a veiled malicious intent. In the weeks that follow, Pinfold broods on the incident. He finds his memory beginning to play tricks on him. The encroaching winter depresses him further; he decides to escape by taking a cruise, and secures passage on the SS Caliban, bound for Ceylon. As the voyage proceeds, Pinfold finds that he hears sounds and conversations {{from other parts of}} the ship which he believes are somehow being transmitted into his cabin. Amid an increasingly bizarre series of overheard incidents, he hears remarks which become progressively more insulting, and then directly threatening towards himself. The main tormentors are a man and a woman, whose vicious words are balanced by those of an affectionate younger woman, Margaret. He is convinced that the man is the BBC interviewer Angel, using his technical knowledge to broadcast the voices. Pinfold spends <b>sleepless</b> <b>nights,</b> awaiting a threatened beating, a kidnapping attempt and a seductive visit from Margaret.|$|E

25|$|Harris soon {{returned}} to performing {{as part of}} a trio with Gerry Mule and Tom Guidera. In 1971, members of the country rock group the Flying Burrito Brothers saw her perform; former Byrds member Chris Hillman had taken over the band after the departure of founder Gram Parsons, was impressed by Harris, and briefly considered asking her to join the Flying Burrito Brothers. Instead, Hillman recommended her to Parsons, who was looking for a female vocalist to collaborate with on his first solo album, GP. Harris toured as a member of Parsons's band, the Fallen Angels, in 1973, and the pair shone during vocal harmonies and duets. Later that year, Parsons and Harris worked on a studio album, Grievous Angel. Parsons died in his motel room near what is now Joshua Tree National Park on September 19, 1973, from an accidental overdose of drugs and alcohol. Parsons's Grievous Angel was released posthumously in 1974, and three more tracks from his sessions with Harris were included on another posthumous Parsons album, <b>Sleepless</b> <b>Nights,</b> in 1976. One more album of recorded material from that period was packaged as Live 1973, but was not released until 1982.|$|E

500|$|The dragons {{featured}} in the episode's finale were implemented by Bluebolt, UK, the lead VFX agency for the first season. VFX supervisor Angela Barson confirmed that the CGI dragons {{were among the most}} stressful effects, prompting <b>sleepless</b> <b>nights.</b> Commenting on the episode's climactic scene where the hatchling dragons are revealed, actress Emilia Clarke told VH1, [...] "You see the relationship that Dany has with her eggs, and you see that grow and grow and grow and kind of the intuitive connection she has with them, you see that develop really beautifully." [...] Clarke also hinted that she expected to [...] "get to play with some more dragons!" [...] in the second season, based on her conversations with book author and executive producer George R.R. Martin. [...] "VFX Data Wrangler" [...] Naill McEvoy has confirmed that dragon presence will be increasing in season two.|$|E
500|$|As {{the studio}} {{sessions}} progressed, the band members' new intimate relationships that formed after various separations started {{to have a}} negative effect on Fleetwood Mac. The musicians did not meet or socialise after their daily work at the Record Plant. At the time, the hippie movement still affected Sausalito's culture and drugs were readily available. Open-ended budgets enabled the band and the engineers to become self-indulgent; <b>sleepless</b> <b>nights</b> and the extensive use of cocaine marked much of the album's production. Chris Stone, one of the Record Plant's owners, indicated in 1997 that Fleetwood Mac brought [...] "excess at its most excessive" [...] by taking over the studio for long and extremely expensive sessions; he stated, [...] "The band would come in at 7atnight, have a big feast, party till1or2 in the morning, and then when they were so whacked-out they couldn't do anything, they'd start recording".|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to offering behind-the-scenes glimpses into Beyoncé's intimate world on tour, the film also features performances of over twenty songs with staging, choreography, lighting and production values. In between performances of [...] "If I Were a Boy", {{which included a}} medley with Alanis Morissette's [...] "You Oughta Know", viewers get glimpses of her childhood from old video footage. The footage transitions from Beyoncé dancing up a storm in her childhood home, to <b>sleepless</b> <b>nights</b> on tour where she worries about her health after nine consecutive days of touring, rehearsing, and recording. Despite her struggles, she sings Destiny's Child songs, [...] "Bootylicious" [...] and [...] "Survivor", and asks for a guest appearance from Kanye West. For [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", Beyoncé's performance is accompanied by YouTube footage of fans mimicking her moves, and a short video clip of US President Barack Obama.|$|E

Whether the song is uptempo or a ballad", adding that [...] "there has to be a heartbeat in back of it. There needs to be a pulse in the song". To American Songwriter, Philip Lawrence from The Smeezingtons recalled <b>sleepless</b> <b>nights</b> during the record's process, as the team was trying to prove that the debut album [...] "wasn't a fluke", which according to Lawrence is [...] "the absolute wrong mind-set to be". He went on expressing that the first four or five months they worked on the record were fruitless, because [...] "nothing would stick". When they decided to leave the studio and have a few drinks, they came to conclusion to relax and not put themselves under so much pressure; it resulted in [...] "the ideas [...] coming out again." ...|$|E
500|$|Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama {{praised the}} variety of genres present in the soundtrack {{and the lack of}} remixes. He gave it an overall rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars, calling it a [...] "zero {{compromise}} album" [...] that [...] "stays true to the film's spirit". Planet Bollywood's Atta Khan rated it 9 out of 10, noting that the soundtrack [...] "unquestionably lives up to all expectations". He felt that it maintained an [...] "all round polished nature" [...] and [...] "is destined to become a classic". Although he, too, enjoyed the musical variety, he believed the composers overused the guitar and synthesizers. Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com gave the soundtrack a score of 3 out of 5, commenting, [...] "Taare Zameen Par isn't your regular soundtrack about fluttering hearts and <b>sleepless</b> <b>nights.</b> What makes these delicate and whimsical creations special is their underlying innocence." [...] According to the Indian trade website Box Office India, with around 11,00,000 units sold, this film's soundtrack album was the year's thirteenth highest-selling.|$|E
500|$|The Brisbane Test {{was dubbed}} [...] "Meckiff's Test" [...] by the Australian media; {{speculation}} abounded that the bowler was being chosen {{so he could}} be no-balled as a public relations effort to promote Australia's anti-throwing credentials. Keith Miller described the left-armer's selection as having [...] "peppered this once drab-looking series into a curry hot-pot, with all the excitement and trimmings of an Alfred Hitchcock thriller". Miller further predicted that the umpires Egar and Lou Rowan would be having <b>sleepless</b> <b>nights</b> and predicted that the selectors would be biting their fingernails, adding that he hoped Meckiff was not being used as a scapegoat for the anti-throwing movement. Former Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly—a correspondent for The Sydney Morning Herald—described the selection as [...] "one of the most fantastic somersaults in cricket policies in our time". As a close friend of the fast bowler, umpire Egar was in a difficult situation; the duo had won a pairs lawn bowling competition just a few months earlier. Nevertheless, the paceman and umpire socialised freely at the pre-match function.|$|E

Tomer said [...] "the reason why it looks so real is that it's not a fighting choreography, but an acting scene. It's not about the kicks and the punches! It's about a tragedy! It's not an action movie at all!" ...|$|R
