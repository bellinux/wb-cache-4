5|$|Vitarelli's {{personal}} views often {{put him at}} odds with the US government. He personally wanted to help the Palauans become self-sufficient, but the TTPI wanted to focus on improving Micronesia–United States relations. Nevertheless, he established community schools that replaced the Japanese three Rs educational model with Deweyism. In 1962, the TTPI assigned Vitarelli as an architect and project coordinator in the Accelerated Elementary <b>School</b> <b>Program</b> (AESP), a project costing over one million dollars. He wanted to have local Palauans to build schools and houses under this program. The TTPI rejected these plans, insisting that the locals could not meet the project's physical specifications. As a result of this conflict, the TTPI transferred Vitarelli to its headquarters in Saipan. While on Saipan, Vitarelli used local bayogo seeds to create the Bo Jo Bo Wishing Doll for an upcoming arts festival. These traditional-style dolls are still sold on Saipan today.|$|E
