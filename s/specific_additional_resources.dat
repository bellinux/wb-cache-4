50|$|The DHS {{administered}} the plan when in came {{into effect in}} December 2004. Within the United States, the responsibility for natural disaster planning and response follows a progression in which responsibility first falls on local governments. When a local government has exhausted its resources, it then requests <b>specific</b> <b>additional</b> <b>resources</b> from the county level. The request process then proceeds similarly from the county to the state {{to the federal government}} as additional resource needs are identified. In the event of a large-scale emergency, DHS assumes primary responsibility for ensuring that response professionals are prepared. This is intended to prevent the negative consequences of uncoordinated responses by local, state, and federal agencies during emergencies.|$|E

Many of the problems that arose developed from inadequate planning and back-up communications systems at various levels. One example of this is that the City of New Orleans attempted to manage the disaster from a hotel ballroom with inadequate back-up communications plans instead of a properly staffed Emergency Operations Center. When phone service failed, they had difficulty communicating their specific needs to the state EOC in Baton Rouge.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Delays are an endemic {{feature of}} the {{construction}} industry. Typically, when a delay occurs in a project, the project manager often expedites progress through activity crashing with respect to available float and time-cost relationships. An accelerated schedule is thus obtained by either prescribing overtime working hours or procuring <b>additional</b> <b>resources</b> {{or a combination of}} both. However, excessively prolonged overtime work can generate quality problems, such as rework, and <b>additional</b> <b>resources.</b> There is therefore a need for a model to assist project managers with understanding the complex nature of attaining a trade-off between overtime working and the procurement of <b>additional</b> <b>resources.</b> In this paper, a system dynamics model for MItigating Days in CONstruction (MiDiCON) due to the effects of prolonged overtime work on project costs and quality is presented To overcome project delays, several options representing various combinations of prescribing overtime work and injecting <b>additional</b> <b>resources</b> are analyzed. Utility theory is then applied to determine the most appropriate solution for mitigating project delays...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} in next-generation Internet is to allocate services to nodes in the network. This problem, known as the service placement problem, can be solved by layered graph approach. However, due {{to the existence of}} resource bottleneck, the requests are rejected from the beginning in the resource constrained network. In this paper we propose two iterative algorithms for efficient allocation of <b>additional</b> <b>resources</b> in order to improve the ratio of accepted service placement requests. To this end, we (1) introduce a new concept of sensitivity for each service node to locate the bottleneck node, (2) state the problem of allocating <b>additional</b> <b>resources,</b> and (3) use sensitivity to propose a simple iterative algorithm and an utilization-based iterative algorithm for efficient resource allocation. The performance of these two algorithms is evaluated by simulation experiments in a variety of parameter settings. The results show that the proposed algorithms increase request acceptance ratio significantly by allocating <b>additional</b> <b>resources</b> into the bottleneck node and links. The utilization-based iterative algorithm also decreases the long-term cost by making efficient use of <b>additional</b> <b>resources...</b>|$|R
