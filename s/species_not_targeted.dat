40|$|Many nature {{reserves}} are established {{to protect the}} habitat needs of particular endangered species of interest but their effectiveness for protecting other species is questionable. In this study, this effectiveness was evaluated in a nature reserve network located in the Qinling Mountains, Shaanxi Province, China. The network of reserves was established mainly {{for the conservation of}} the giant panda, a species considered as a surrogate for the conservation of many other endangered species in the region. The habitat suitability of nine protected species, including the giant panda, was modeled by using Maximum Entropy (MAXENT) and their spatial congruence was analyzed. Habitat suitability of these species was also overlapped with nature reserve boundaries and their management zones (i. e., core, buffer and experimental zones). Results show that in general the habitat of the giant panda constitutes a reasonable surrogate of the habitat of other protected species, and giant panda reserves protect a relatively high proportion of the habitat of other protected species. Therefore, giant panda habitat conservation also allows the conservation of the habitat of other protected species in the region. However, a large area of suitable habitat was excluded from the nature reserve network. In addition, four species exhibited a low proportion of highly suitable habitat inside the core zones of nature reserves. It suggests that a high proportion of suitable habitat of protected <b>species</b> <b>not</b> <b>targeted</b> for conservation is located in the experimental and buffer zones, thus, is being affected by human activities. To increase their conservation effectiveness, nature reserves and their management zones need to be re-examined in order to include suitable habitat of more endangered species. The procedures described in this study can be easily implemented for the conservation of many endangered species not only in China but in many other parts of the world...|$|E
40|$|Masters Research - Master of Philosophy (MPhil) Despite an {{increase}} in elasmobranch research in general, the knowledge of small benthic shark species is still sparse. Commonly, <b>species</b> <b>not</b> <b>targeted</b> in commercial fisheries and of limited economic value are rarely the focus of research and often assumed to be relatively resilient to increased mortality rates. However, many of these species inhabit areas which are exposed to significant impact from anthropogenic perturbation such as fishing, coastal development, dredging and pollution. It is therefore important to collect information on these less studied species regarding basic biology, life history strategies, ecology and demography {{as well as their}} place and function in the ecosystem. This study was conducted from July 2011 to September 2013 and investigated the basic biology and life history of the blind shark, Brachaelurus waddi, a small benthic shark endemic to the east coast of Australia. A total of 180 blind sharks were obtained from a commercial trap fishery operating off the Central Coast of New South Wales. Vertebral band counts were used to estimate age and growth parameters for B. waddi, whilst Marginal Increment Analysis (MIA) and edge analysis (EA) was used to validate the growth band deposition rate. The von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) and linear regression were used to estimate growth rates. Assuming an annual growth band deposition, maximum age {{for both males and females}} was 19 years. The VBGF produced growth estimates for males that indicated slow growth, L∞ 1112 mm and k= 0. 03 years- 1. Female length-at-age data did not provide any reliable growth estimates. Importantly, the MIA and EA, proved to be less reliable for B. waddi, indicating that growth bands may not be deposited annually. Length and age at maturity was determined for males whilst length at maturity was determined for females. Reproductive periodicity, including gestation time and vitellogenic period was determined for females. Sex-ratio of pups, and length at birth were estimated as well as litter size. Female B. waddi matured at a smaller TL than males (L 50 females; 495 mm TL, L 50 males; 581 mm TL), which is contrary to most shark species. Age at maturity for males was estimated to between 7. 3 - 13. 9 years (L 50 -L 95). Females displayed consecutive growth of follicles and embryos, each lasting one year, with a likely yearlong resting phase. B. waddi has a reproductive cycle that it, at least, biennial and more likely triennial. Litter size ranged from three to nine (mean= 6. 6) embryos per female and length at birth was approximately 175 - 209 mm TL...|$|E

Totara and other woody native <b>species</b> were <b>not</b> <b>targeted.</b> The site had been regularly grazed by cattle using a beef-raising regime achieving 800  kg live weight per ha per year, estimated by the landowner to approximate 11 stock units per ha (ewe equivalents). This intensive grazing regime comprised break-feeding using portable electric fencing on a 35 -day rotation over summer (October-April) and 70 -day rotation over winter (May-September). As part of standard farm practice the site had been top-dressed annually with reactive rock phosphate with potassium at 350  kg per ha. Lime had been applied at 2.5 tonnes per ha once every four years. Fertiliser and lime were applied by truck traversing the flat and rolling terrain with some associated dispersal onto steeper hill slopes (Doug Lane, pers. comm.).|$|R
50|$|The filetail {{catshark}} (Parmaturus xaniurus) is an Eastern Pacific endemic deepwater catshark {{ranging from}} Oregon to the Gulf of California. Adults are epibenthic and found near areas of rocky vertical relief over soft mud bottoms {{on the outer}} continental shelf and upper slope at depths of 91 to 1,251 m, juveniles are mesopelagic, found around 500 m off the bottom in waters over 1,000 m deep. Reaches a maximum size of 60 cm TL. An oviparous species, females deposit eggcases throughout the year with concentrated reproductive output July through September. There is no information available on the age and growth, longevity, fecundity, abundance or mortality of this <b>species.</b> It is <b>not</b> <b>targeted</b> by commercial fisheries or utilized for human consumption, but {{is known to be}} incidental catch in longline and bottom trawl fisheries, although no specific data is available.|$|R
25|$|Drift nets {{are usually}} used to catch {{schooling}} forage fish such as herring and sardines, and also larger pelagic fish such as tuna, salmon and pelagic squid. Net haulers are usually {{used to set}} and haul driftnets, with a drifter capstan on the forepart of the vessel. In developing countries most nets are hauled by hand. The mesh size of the gillnets is very effective at selecting or regulating the size of fish caught. The drift net has a low fuel/fish energy consumption compared to other fishing gear. However, the issue of concern {{with this type of}} net is the bycatch of <b>species</b> that are <b>not</b> <b>targeted,</b> such as marine mammals, seabirds and to a minor extent turtles. The use of drift nets longer than 2.5 kilometres on the high seas was banned by the United Nations in 1991. Prior to this ban, drift nets were reaching lengths of 60 kilometres.

40|$|Vector, snail and rodent-borne {{diseases}} {{are responsible for}} {{a great deal of}} human morbidity and mortality in the tropical developing countries. Of the three methods for controlling tropical diseases, environmental, biological and chemical, pesticides are the best alternative.

Public health officials must be concerned that the compound chosen is safe for the user as well as inhabitants and domestic animals in the treated area. The method of control must also be appropriate for each targeted vector, because there are large biological differences among species. Some other considerations are that: (a) the chemical must be a narrow spectrum pesticide; (b) it should be effective in the proposed geographic area; (c) the target should be evaluated to check its resistance to a given chemical; and (d) the proposed pesticide must not pose a hazard to <b>species</b> that are <b>not</b> <b>targeted.</b> Earth Sciences&GIS,Health Monitoring&Evaluation,Pest Management,Montreal Protocol,Agricultural Knowledge&Information Systems...|$|R

40|$|For {{successful}} blood-feeding, ticks {{must confront}} the host immune system comprising many cells and signaling molecules, mainly cytokines and growth factors. These factors bind to specific receptors {{on the cell}} membranes, thereby initiating a signaling cascade that leads to distinct cellular activities. Ticks are able to manipulate host immune responses via molecules secreted from their salivary glands. Saliva of ixodid ticks contains factors binding important cytokines and their subgroup, chemokines. Here we demonstrate that constituents of tick salivary gland extract (SGE) also appear to bind growth factors: transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β 1), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF- 2), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), depending on tick species. SGE derived from Amblyomma variegatum reacted with TGF-β 1, PDGF, FGF- 2 and HGF; Dermacentor reticulatus and Rhipicephalus appendiculatus with TGF-β 1, FGF- 2 and HGF; and Ixodes ricinus and Ixodes scapularis with PDGF. SGE from the species targeting PDGF (A. variegatum and I. ricinus) also inhibited cell proliferation in vitro and induced a change in morphology of different cell lines. These effects correlated with disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. Such effects were not observed with SGE of the two <b>species</b> that did <b>not</b> <b>target</b> PDGF.

30|$|Herring (C. harengus) and {{mackerels}} (T. trachurus, S. scombrus) {{were also}} frequently caught by traps throughout the study. The presence and distributions of these planktivorous species of commercial interest are usually correlated, but both populations display {{spatial and temporal}} differences (Langøy et al. 2012; Utne et al. 2012). Although these species frequently use the same feeding and spawning areas, mackerels seemed to prefer warmer water than herring (Utne et al. 2012), and therefore, occurred near surface (0 – 5  m) more frequently during summer. Some flatfishes of commercial interest were also captured during this study, but {{to a less extent}} than gadids or small pelagic fishes. Flatfishes such as plaice (P. platessa) and turbot (S. maximus) are generally abundant far inside fjords, living on sandy, rocky or mixed bottoms of shallow brackish waters (Albert et al. 1998). Although these traps were not specifically designed for this kind of bentho-demersal fish (He and Inoue 2010) some individuals might be trapped during spawning or feeding on shallow coastal waters. On their turn, small demersal fishes such as wrasses (e.g. L. bergylta, L. bimaculatus, C. exoletus, C. rupestris, S. melops) were captured in very less numbers probably due to the large mesh size of the traps in this study. They are commonly found in shallow rocky bottoms along the coast of Norwegian fjords (Salvanes and Nordeide 1993), and expected to be found within trap captures (Darwall et al. 1992; Bjordal 1993; Barlaup et al. 2013). Other migratory species, such as the pelagic garfish (B. belone) and the benthopelagic lumpsucker (C. lumpus), were also captured in this study, but they presented less abundance and a great spatial and temporal heterogeneity. These <b>species</b> were <b>not</b> <b>targeted</b> in the study area but can be accidentally caught as by-catch in outer fisheries (e.g. Evans et al. 1994; van Marlen et al. 2014). The catadromous eel (A. anguilla) was rarely captured, probably due to the large mesh size (Poole 1990; Chisnall and West 1996) or a seasonal effect, since seaward migrations mainly occur during autumn (Haraldstad et al. 1985; Vøllestad 1986).|$|R
40|$|Reports were scanned {{in black}} and white at a {{resolution}} of 600 dots per inch and were converted to text using Adobe Paper Capture Plug-in. Prior to this study, the alien plant control program at Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park was hampered by the paucity and quality of alien plant distribution maps. A systematic program to map important localized alien plants was conducted 1983 - 1985 to determine the need and feasibility of controlling key alien plant species, establish a baseline for assessing the spread of these species, infer range expansions, locate all populations of a target species to assure thorough treatment, and assess the effectiveness of control programs. Thirty-six species were mapped, with emphasis given to localized alien plant species and those listed as target species in the 1982 Resources Management Plan (National Park Service 1982). The studies focused on Ainahou Ranch, Kilauea Crater, and the Coastal Lowlands west of the 1 % 9 - 1974 Mauna Ulu flows. The species distributions were mapped on topographic maps at 1 : 24, 000, 1 : 12, 000, or 1 : 6, 000 scales, although most species are displayed in this report on smaller scale maps. In addition, species profiles are provided. These characterize importance to management, significance as a pest in native ecosystems, effective treatment methods, and history of management. There were two important findings from the distribution studies. Eleven <b>species,</b> previously <b>not</b> <b>targeted</b> for management, were identified from mapping efforts to be invasive and require control efforts. These are Formosan koa, slash pine, loquat, sisal, orange pittosporum, oleaster, English ivy, paperbark, blackwood acacia, kudzu, and guavasteen. The second finding is that five target species were found to be much more widespread than previously thought. These include silky oak, koa haole, fountain grass, Russian olive, and raspberry. This finding lead to an approach in which control efforts on widespread species were carried out only in intensive management units called Special Ecological Areas.

40|$|Implementing {{ecosystem}} based {{fisheries management}} (EBFM) {{will require a}} suite of ecological indices to track the state of an ecosystem, in addition to monitoring species-abundance for both economically important species, as well as <b>species</b> that are <b>not</b> <b>targeted</b> for harvest. However, EBFM implementation requires an examination of current methods and applications of ecological indices that are being used. This paper identifies four key uses for ecosystem indices {{in the context of}} EBFM and discusses the implications of each: (1) motivation for socio-political action, (2) information for individual users to modify their behavior, (3) implementation of decision rules for management evaluation, and (4) discovery of ecosystem functions to advance scientific knowledge. In a fisheries management context, ecological indicators will be linked to decision rules based on the definitions of both "ecosystem overfishing" and the current single-species definitions of overfishing. Two components of common ecological indicators are species weightings (i. e. catch or abundance data by species) and the species-specific ecological attributes (e. g. mortality rates, body size, trophic level). We discuss statistical issues that arise from estimating the parameters in ecological index calculations from both fishery-dependent and independent data and the potential biases introduced by using catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data, catch data, and abundance estimates. Given the range of biases that arise, often the best estimates of species weightings (abundances) are those derived from fish stock assessments. This implies that progress in EBFM may be best served by increasing the number of species for which single-species assessments are done and to expand the list of species to include <b>species</b> which may <b>not</b> be economically important. The policy framework exists to carry out EBFM; however, future works needs to focus on empirical management strategy simulations, as well as theoretical works to identify management criteria based on those indicators.

40|$|Three {{species of}} skates {{commonly}} {{occur in the}} southern Gulf of St. Lawrence: thorny skate Amblyraja radiata, winter skate Leucoraja ocellata, and smooth skate Malacoraja senta. Trends in their abundance and size are described using data from annual bottom-trawl surveys conducted each September since 1971. Biomass and the abundance of mature skates decreased over the 1971 – 2002 period, by 80 – 90 % for thorny and winter skates, {{and to a lesser}} degree for smooth skates. Abundance of juvenile thorny and smooth skates increased from the mid- 1980 s to a peak in the mid- 1990 s, and then declined in the late 1990 s. Mean length decreased by 20 – 30 % during the 1980 s {{for each of the three}} species. The increase in the abundance of juvenile skates in the 1990 s coincided with a collapse in the biomass of large-bodied demersal teleost fishes, a dramatic decline in fishing effort, a cooling of the cold intermediate layer in the southern Gulf and decreasing abundance of mature skates. The decline in the abundance of large skates may be an effect of fishing, though reported landings of skates have been low.

Predictions of the survival of discarded fish are dependent on understanding how a fish responds to stressful conditions. Our objective was to describe the immunological health of sablefish exposed to capture stressors. In laboratory experiments designed to simulate the capture process, we subjected sablefish to various stressors that might influence survival: Towing in a net, hooking, elevated seawater and air temperatures, and air exposure time. After stress was imposed, the in vitro mitogen-stimulated proliferation of sablefish leukocytes {{was used to evaluate}} the function of the immune system in an assay we validated for this species. The results demonstrated that regardless of fishing gear type, exposure to elevated seawater temperature, or time in air, the leukocytes from stressed sablefish exhibited significantly diminished proliferative responses to the T-cell mitogen, concanavalin A, or the B-cell mitogen, lipopolysaccharide. There was no difference in the immunological responses associated with seawater or air temperature. The duration and severity of the capture stressors applied in our study were harsh enough to induce significantly elevated levels of plasma cortisol and glucose, but {{there was no difference in}} the magnitude of levels among stressor treatments. These data suggest that immunological suppression occurs in sablefish subjected to capture-related stressors. The functional impairment of the immune system after capture presents a potential reason why delayed mortality is possible in discarded sablefish.

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{contribution}} of fish spawning aggregations and aggregating species to commercial marine fisheries in the Gulf of California, we: (1) investigated associations between the timing of spawning aggregations and monthly trends in commercial landings and ex-vessel revenues for aggregating reef fishes in the southwest Gulf of California and (2) compared present (2000 - 2005) and past (1956 - 1961) landings of aggregating species groups from the entire Gulf. Species known to form seasonal spawning aggregations comprised the eight most important commercial reef fish fisheries of the southwest Gulf with respect to landings and ex-vessel revenues, and three of these species increased in annual landings between 1999 and 2007. Peaks in mean monthly landings and revenues for five of eight aggregating species coincided with the timing of their spawning aggregations, whereas commercial fisheries for the remaining three <b>species</b> did <b>not</b> specifically <b>target</b> spawning aggregation periods.
