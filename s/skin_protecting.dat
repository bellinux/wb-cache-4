They are generally designed for subcompact and compact handguns since they are easier to conceal. Concealment holsters {{are designed to}} be worn under clothing, such as on the belt under a coat, under pants in an ankle holster, or in a trouser pocket. Since the holster is held close to the body, comfort is important, and concealment holsters often have broad surfaces in contact with the user's body, to distribute the pressure across a wider area and prevent abrasion of the <b>skin.</b> <b>Protecting</b> the handgun from the user's perspiration is often an important consideration in such carry locations. Often the outside of the holster is broader, to help break up the outline of the handgun and prevent printing, where the outline of the gun can be seen through clothing. For pocket holsters, the external flat side is often the side with a nap, or rougher surface, to hold the holster in place when drawing the pistol.|$|E
40|$|Abstractβ-Carotene is {{discussed}} as an anti-oxidant micronutrient and singlet oxygen quencher in human <b>skin,</b> <b>protecting</b> against UV light-induced damage. However, we recently demonstrated that β-carotene has a pro-oxidant potential in cultured human skin fibroblasts because it enhances the UVA induction of heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1). Herein, we further show that β-carotene also strongly promotes the UVA induction of pro-inflammatory interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) in skin fibroblasts in vitro. Singlet oxygen quencher sodium azide abrogated up-regulation of IL- 6, and likewise also of HO- 1. In UVB-irradiated cells, β-carotene did not modulate levels of IL- 6 and HO- 1.

Alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay) was employed to assess aqueous extracts derived from soil or hydroponically glasshouse-grown roots of Althea officinalis (Marshmallow) and Astragalus membranaceus, compared with commercial, field-grown roots. Hydroponically grown root extracts from both plant species were found to significantly reduce UVA-induced DNA damage in cultured human lung and skin fibroblasts, although initial Astragalus experimentation detected some genotoxic effects, indicating that Althea root extracts may be better suited as potential constituents of dermatological formulations. Glasshouse-grown soil and hydroponic Althea root extracts afforded lung fibroblasts with statistically significant protection against UVA irradiation for a greater period of time than the commercial field-grown roots. No significant reduction in DNA damage was observed when total ultraviolet irradiation (including UVB) was employed (data not shown), indicating that the extracted phytochemicals predominantly protected against indirect UVA-induced oxidative stress.

Traditional cooling rice powder or can be known as bedak sejuk is a traditional cosmetic product made from rice. This cooling rice powder is applied {{not only on the}} face but it can be applied over the whole human body for <b>skin</b> <b>protecting</b> and healing. Through distribution of questionnaires, the improvement of bedak sejuk was decided. A survey to identify the usage percentage of bedak sejuk among students of Universiti Malaysia Kelantan, Jeli Campus was first conducted before the questionnaires were distributed. Based on the descriptive analysis of questionnaire obtained, aroma and packaging of bedak sejuk rated as the lowest score. The bedak sejuk was then improved in term of aroma instead of improvement in packaging because of some limitation. The improved bedak sejuk is then further analyzed with microbial testing and heavy metal testing for the safety evaluation of cosmetic product generally. From the study conducted, it shows that the sample bought in the market have the lowest content of microbes which is 0. 15 x 105 cfu/ml. From the result obtained in heavy metal analysis, all samples are not contained mercury, lead and cadmium concentration above the permissible limit. Therefore, all the bedak sejuk' are safe for consumption. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT − DEET, N,N’-diethyl-m-toluamide, is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used mosquito repellent. However, it can easily permeate through skin leading to toxic effects. A recent study showed that the ortho analogue of DEET showed enhanced repellency with reduced permeation compared to the commercially used meta analogue. Thus, {{in order to understand the}} differences in properties and effectiveness among the m-, o- and p-analogues of DEET, an HPLC-UV method was developed for separately analyzing the three analogues. Moreover, stability profiles at temperatures ranging from 30 oC to 70 oC as well as pH ranging from pH 3 to pH 9 have been determined. All three analogues were stable with no degradation observed dur-ing the 5 day period. o-DEET therefore could be further developed into a safer and more effective mosquito repellent. Key words − DEET, Temperature stability, pH stability, Mosquito repellency m-DEET is known as the golden standard of mosquito repel-lents for being highly effective, stable and relatively safe (Katz et al., 2008). In most cases it is directly applied to the human <b>skin</b> <b>protecting</b> against tick-borne diseases (Jensennius et al., 2005) and mosquito-mediated diseases including dengue fever, West Nile virus and Eastern Equine Encephalitis (Gubler, 2001). However, information about the mechanism of action of DEET is still controversial. Studies report that DEET may block behavior of mosquitoes by inhibiting chemo-receptors on the mosquito antennae that are stimulated by lactic acid (Dogan et al., 1999) whereas other studies refute this phe-nomenon (Syed and Leal, 2008). Nevertheless, m-DEET exhibits mosquito repellency as shown in the complete pro-tection time (CPT) ranging from 203 to 756 minutes, varying with factors including climatic effects, mosquito species and physical activities (Barnard and Xue, 2004; Bidlingmayer...|$|E

40|$|Mastitis causes largest {{economic}} losses in dairy production. Sub-clinical mastitis is detected in 50 % of lactating cows in Lithuania. Curing effect is transient if major causes and factors of mastitis are not eliminated. Prophylactic measures are directed {{to strengthen the}} immune system of the cow and to define and to eliminate all factors causing mastitis. Bacteria are present on skin of the teat in the surroundings. Use of antiseptics of cow teats before and after milking {{is the most effective}} preventive procedure that can prevent from new mastitis cases. Antiseptic solutions help to fight most opportunistic and contagious bacterial infections causing mastitis. Teat antiseptics can reduce mastitis incidence by 50 to 75 %. It is recommended to use antiseptic solutions for udder and teats, as they improve physical condition of the udder and milk quality. Agents for udder and teat antiseptics contain bactericidal, <b>skin</b> <b>protecting</b> components in aqueous solution. Bactericidal activity is defined to kill germs during chemical and biological reactions. Active ingredients are iodoforms, chlorhexidins, sodium hypochloride, sodium chloride, lactic acid, hypochloric acid, antimicrobial proteins and fatty acids. Teat dipping reduces bacterial milk contamination, and spreading of pathogens on the teats during the milking. For the present moment this procedure is also used in Europe. Spraying teats with two different concentrations of iodine solution before and after the milking effectively reduces skin contamination with staphylococcal and colliform bacteria. Action of pre-dip and post-dip is similar. The aim of our investigation was {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} antiseptic materials used before and after milking on bulk milk bacterial contamination, somatic cell count and incidences of sub-clinical mastitis. We selected in farm No. 1, cows with 500 000 103 /ml somatic cell count. In this farm antiseptic teat dipping was routinely used after milking. In this farm we also used disincentive wood shave for udder cleansing. Udders were cleansed before each milking using 5 to 10 g. disincentive wood shave soaked in water. No significant changes were observed after the use of this udder cleansing method. At the start of the experiment in Farm No. 1, total bacterial count was 57. 33 ± 9. 45 103 /ml. and 7 days following the treatment decreased to 49. 11 ± 9. 45 103 /ml. One month after the treatment total bacterial count was 43. 67 ± 7. 82 103 /ml (p> 0. 5). These changes in were not statistically significant. Somatic cell count was 507. 89 ± 47. 40 103 /ml. One month after the treatment somatic cell count was 199. 33 ± 41. 69 103 /ml (p> 0. 1). These changes in were not statistically In farm No. 2, no antiseptic substances were used before the experiment. Before each milking, udders were routinely cleaned with damp towels. At the start of the experiment, udders were cleansed with disincentive wood shave and teats were dipped following the milking. At the start of the experiment, the results were worse – total bacterial count increased, as well as somatic cell count. Microbial contamination of udder was higher at the start of the experiment, compared to the end. At the start of use of antiseptic substances, bacterial udder contamination significantly decreased, and this resulted in decreased milk bacterial contamination and milk somatic cell count. At the start of the experiment in Farm No. 1, total bacterial count was 46. 33 ± 8. 23 103 /ml. and 7 days following the treatment decreased to 40. 21 ± 7. 33 103 /ml. One month after the treatment total bacterial count was 35. 24 ± 7. 82 103 /ml (p> 0, 5). These changes in were not statistically significant. Somatic cell count was 340. 0 ± 36. 93 103 /ml. One month after the treatment somatic cell count was 122. 17 ± 12. 08 103 /ml (p> 0. 1). These changes in were not statistically Wood shave was used for udder cleaning in the farm. Many farms use this cleaning method for the present time. It is very effective to remove rests of bedding and manure from the teats. It is enough 5 to 10 g. of wood shave to clean udder ant teats. The shave can also be soaked with antiseptic solution. One more advantage is that teat cleansing with wood shave more intensively stimulates milk let-down. We, however, did not observe an increase in milk production during our experiment, but this cleansing method had positive effect reducing bacterial contamination of udder. Analysis data shows that antiseptic materials must be used before and after the milking, because teat canal is open 30 min. after the milking...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY In humans, skin is {{the largest}} organ {{and serves as a}} barrier between our body and the outside world. <b>Skin</b> <b>protects</b> our {{internal}} organs from external pathogens and other contaminants, and melanocytes within the <b>skin</b> <b>protect</b> the body from damage by ultraviolet light. These same pigment cells also determine our skin colour and complexion. Skin wounding triggers a repair response that includes a robust recruitment of inflammatory cells, which function to kill invading microbes and clear away cell and matrix debris. Once at the wound site, these innate immune cells release a barrage of cytokines that direct the activities of other cells during the repair process. Tissue damage and repair also frequently lead to alterations in skin pigmentation, in particular to wound hyperpigmentation. In this study, we describe a model of wound hyperpigmentation in the translucent zebrafish larva, where we can live-image the recruitment of melanocytes and their precursors, melanoblasts, to the wound site. We show that these pigment cells are drawn in after the initial recruitment of innate immune cells and that the inflammatory response is essential for wound hyperpigmentation. This new model will allow us to uncover the molecular link between immune and pigment cells during tissue repair and to screen for potential therapeutics to dampen wound hyperpigmentation...|$|R
40|$|<b>Skin</b> <b>protects</b> {{itself against}} {{infection}} {{through a variety}} of mechanisms. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are major contributors to cutaneous innate immunity, and this system, combined with the unique ionic, lipid and physical barrier of the epidermis is the first line defense against invading pathogens. However, recent studies have revealed that our skin’s innate immune system is not solely of human origin. Staphylococcus epidermidis, a major constituent of the normal microflora on healthy human skin, acts as a barrier against colonization of potentially pathogenic microbes and against overgrowth of already present opportunistic pathogens. Our resident commensal microbes produce their own AMPs, act to enhance the normal production of AMPs by keratinocytes, and are beneficial to maintaining inflammatory homeostasis by suppressing excess cytokine release after minor epidermal injury. These observations indicate that the normal human <b>skin</b> microflora <b>protects</b> <b>skin</b> via various modes of action, a conclusion supported by many lines of evidence associating diseases such as acne, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis and rosacea with an imbalance of the microflora {{even in the absence of}} classical infection.
