In this paper we define an allometry inspired <b>scaling</b> <b>indicator</b> for cities that is a first step towards quantifying the resilience borne of a complex systems' hierarchical structural composition. The <b>scaling</b> <b>indicator</b> is calculated using large census datasets and is analogous to fractal dimension in spatial analysis.

40|$|AbstractThe loss {{of natural}} {{habitats}} {{and the loss}} of biological diversity is a global problem affecting all ecosystems including agricultural landscapes. Indicators of biodiversity can provide standardized measures that make it easier to compare and communicate changes to an ecosystem. In agricultural landscapes the amount and variety of available habitat is directly correlated with biodiversity levels. Linear woody features (LWF), including hedgerows, windbreaks, shelterbelts as well as woody shrubs along fields, roads and watercourses, {{play a vital role in}} supporting biodiversity as well as serving a wide variety of other purposes in the ecosystem. Earth observation can be used to quantify and monitor LWF across the landscape. While individual features can be manually mapped, this research focused on the development of methods using line intersect sampling (LIS) for estimating LWF as an indicator of habitat availability in agricultural landscapes. The methods are accurate, efficient, repeatable and provide robust results. Methods were tested over 9. 5 Mha of agricultural landscape in the Canadian Mixedwood Plains ecozone. Approximately 97, 000 km of LWF were estimated across this landscape with results useable both at a regional reporting scale, as well as mapped across space for use in wildlife habitat modelling or other landscape management research. The LIS approach developed here could be employed at a variety of scales in particular for large regions and could be adapted for use as a national <b>scale</b> <b>indicator</b> of habitat availability in heavily disturbed agricultural landscape...|$|E

The morphologies of SMC PNs {{are similar to those}} of LMC and Galactic PNs. However, only a third of the resolved SMC PNs are asymmetric, compared to half in the LMC. The low metallicity environment of the SMC seems to discourage the onset of bipolarity in PNs. We measured the line intensity, average surface brightness (SB), and photometric radius of each nebula in halpha, hbeta, [O III] lambda 4959 and 5007, [NII] 6548 and 6584, [S II] lambda 6716 and 5731, He I 6678, and [OI] 6300 and 6363. We show that the surface brightness to radius relationship is the same as in LMC PNs, indicating its possible use as a distance <b>scale</b> <b>indicator</b> for Galactic PNs. We determine the electron densities and the ionized masses of the nebulae where the [S II] lines were measured accurately, and we find that the SMC PNs are denser than the LMC PNs by a factor of 1. 5. The average ionized mass of the SMC PNs is 0. 3 Msun. We also found that the median [O III]/hbeta intensity ratio in the SMC is about half than the corresponding LMC median. We use Cloudy to model the dependence of the [O III]/hbeta ratio on the oxygen abundance. Our models encompass very well the average observed physical quantities. We suggest that the SMC PNs are principally cooled by the carbon lines, making it hard to study their excitation based on the optical lines at our disposal.

40|$|In this research, the {{behaviours}} of hot particle curtains are investigated experimentally and numerically. An {{introduction to}} particle curtains and their importance in industry {{is given in}} Chapter 1, where the broad research aims are stated. These include developing a CFD model of hot particle curtains, to experimentally characterising the curtain bulk properties, and assessing the reliability of experimental methods and predictability of CFD modelling techniques. Chapter 2 provides a literature review which first outlines typical industrial drying equipment and emphasises flighted rotary dryers, because they are examples of a device in which particle curtains are critical to their performance. Various approaches to modelling flighted rotary dryers were discussed and in particular, the methods used to model particle curtains were outlined. CFD {{was identified as a}} powerful tool for modelling particle curtains within flighted rotary dryers. The various Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approaches were described and Eulerian-Eulerian was selected for further consideration because of its simplicity and potential for extracting bulk property predictions. Examples of modelling particle curtains in the literature were discussed in order to choose the most effective methods and equations. Drag and heat transfer were emphasised. In this thesis, hot particle curtains were simulated using Eulerian-Eulerian CFD. Chapter 3 presents CFD models to generate single particle curtains which are bounded by a rectangular box with slot widths varying between 20 mm and 80 mm. Particles with mean diameters of 290 μm, 400 μm and 610 μm were modelled. The single particle model in the absence of internal heat conduction, widely used in modelling particle curtains in flighted rotary dryers, was also presented for comparison. Centreline particle temperature profiles from CFD simulations were compared to those derived using the single particle model. The base CFD model was used to derive Reduced Order Models (ROM) suitable for implementation in larger scale process models. Furthermore, CFD simulations of the effects of particle mass flow, particle size, and particle slot width on temperature profiles and heat loss, were investigated using analysis of variance techniques. Good agreement was found between CFD and single particle at low mass flow rates and small particle sizes, but the single particle model was not able to predict the behaviour of particles in curtains at larger particle sizes and higher mass flow rates. A ROM correlation was developed to enable the single particle model {{to be used as a}} basis for predicting curtain behaviour. Key properties of particle curtains that were modelled included residence time, curtain area and average solid volume fraction. Methodologies based on image analysis techniques to identify the edges of the curtain from CFD data were also described. Chapter 4 describes experimental apparatus and methods used to generate hot particle curtains. The primary apparatus consisted of a hopper, perforated plates, wire mesh screens, <b>scale</b> <b>indicator,</b> data logger and oven.
