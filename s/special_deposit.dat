40|$|This paper explores {{recurring}} patterns among <b>special</b> animal <b>deposits</b> {{in rural}} {{settlements in the}} Dutch river area from the Roman period and draws a comparison with finds of other material categories. Recognising patterns is a step towards interpreting <b>special</b> <b>deposits</b> as the material remains of ritual actions since ritual usually follows strict rules. Any interpretation of <b>special</b> <b>deposits,</b> such as animal burials, {{should be based on}} sound argumentation. Archaeologists may be faced with, and have to distinguish between, deliberate or casual rubbish disposal, intentional deposition without attending rituals and deposition surrounded by ritual actions. Detailed descriptions of good examples of both rubbish dumps and structured deposits will be of great value in this process. This paper also argues for a more holistic approach where various find categories are studied together. This will lead to the identification of similarities between deposits. As an example, remarkable bone and non-bone finds from wells are described. Some of these finds should be seen as foundation or abandonment deposits, suggesting that like farmhouses, wells had a life cycle punctuated by ritual moments. <b>Special</b> <b>deposits</b> of animal remains and other find categories deserve much more attention than they now receive in excavation reports...|$|R

5000|$|Competition {{and credit}} control (CCC) was a {{monetary}} policy {{operated by the}} Bank of England from September 1971 until the autumn of 1973.

Reserve Asset Ratios were imposed on all financial institutions where formerly cash and liquidity rations had applied to major clearing banks only.

50|$|It {{should be}} noted that while the Treasury can and does hold cash and a <b>special</b> <b>deposit</b> account at the Fed (fed funds), these assets do not count in any of the aggregates.

To counter this, the government created the Treasury Tax and Loan (TT&L) program in which any receipts above a certain threshold are redeposited in private banks. The idea is that tax receipts won't decrease the amount of reserves in the banking system. The TT&L accounts, while demand deposits, do not count toward M1 or any other aggregate either.|$|E

Due to untamed territory and also to prevent a reduction in population, Ibarra bought a mine that offered the Indigenous peoples and the Spanish explorers work, with the sole condition that they in turn would settle in the new-founded city.|$|E

40|$|The {{excavations}} of the Cambridge Keros Project at early {{bronze age}} Dhaskalio and Dhaskalio Kavos on the Cycladic Island of Keros during the 2006 and 2007 seasons are described. They were directed by Colin Renfrew with Olga Philaniotou as Associate Director and Neil Brodie and Giorgos Gavalas as Assistant Directors. The site of Dhaskalio Kavos is well-known for the extensive looting {{which took place}} there during the 1950 's. Rescue excavations by Christos Doumas in 1963 and by Photeini Zapheiropoulou in 1967, and a project in 1987, directed by Renfrew, Doumas and Lila Marangou, defined {{the extent of the}} looted 'special deposit', assigned to the early bronze age Keros-Syros culture (Early Bronze II). At the beginning of the 2006 field season a separate and unlooted <b>special</b> <b>deposit</b> was located {{at the southern end of}} the Kavos site (the 'Special Deposit South'). Its excavation yielded thousands of fragments of marble vessels and potsherds, and hundreds of broken marble figurines. These had been deliberately broken elsewhere, brought to the site and deposited there in what appears to be a ritual context. Work on the <b>Special</b> <b>Deposit</b> South continued in 2007, and excavations on the extensive Early Cycladic settlement on the small (200 metre) but precipitous island of Dhaskalio were initiated. Well preserved building remains were uncovered with abundant Early Cycladic domestic materials. Dhaskalio island may now be recognised as a major settlement of the Keros-Syros culture (c. 2800 to 2300 BC). Kavos, immediately opposite on Keros itself, is confirmed as the locus for two separate areas of structured deposition of high status materials, brought from a wide range of sources in the Cyclades and possibly beyond, apparently already in fragmentary condition, and placed there in a series of prestations for which a ritual context may safely be inferred. Dhaskalio Kavos may now be claimed as the first major symbolic centre of the early Aegean...|$|E

In this situation a <b>special</b> <b>deposit</b> system is necessary, which supports procedures to preserve electronic publications (online and offline) and keeps them accessible through time. To implement such a system, specific standards, technologies, and procedures are needed. The basic standard of a Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System – OAIS describes the situation in principal. The OAIS generic model consists of functional entities with well-defined interfaces and introduces a concept of packages to standardize and interconnect preservable content and metadata. Within this model the building block "Archival Storage" is responsible for keeping intact the bitstream of the digital object&# 39;s preservation master. It may either be the original bitstream or the result of one of several migration procedures in the archive life cycle of the digital object. Whatever strategy will be followed in the future to provide access to the digital content, it will depend on the existence of a bitstream, the integrity and authenticity of which has been kept in order over the years.

40|$|Nonsulfides" is a term,which {{comprises}} {{a series}} of oxidized Zn(Pb) -ore minerals. It has also been used to define a <b>special</b> <b>deposit</b> type, mainly considered as derived from the weathering of Zn(Pb) sulfide concentrations. However, nonsulfide zinc deposits have been distinguished between supergene and hypogene, according to their mineralogy, geological characteristics and genetic setting. The supergene deposits formed by weathering and oxidation at ambient temperatures, whereas the hypogene ones are considered hydrothermal, or associated with metamorphic processes on primary sulfide ores. In this review paper, a comparison between a number of several nonsulfide deposits has been carried out: typical "Calamines", peculiar "Calamines" and "Others". The whole group comprises deposits of typical supergene origin, mixed supergene, hypogene mineralizations, and oxidized concentrations characterized by different metals only locally associated with zinc. The Zn-Pb nonsulfide concentrations hosted in carbonate rocks, which are mainly attributed to "wall-rock replacement" and "direct-replacement" supergene processes, are the typical "Calamines" (Liège district, Belgium; Iglesias district, Italy; Silesia-Cracow district, Poland). Peculiar "Calamine" deposits are those mineralizations that have been generally considered as supergene, but which are instead genetically related, at least partly, to hypogene processes (e. g. Angouran, Iran; Jabali, Yemen), though mineralogically and texturally similar to supergene nonsulfide deposits. The "Others" are prevailingly supergene nonsulfide zinc deposits not hosted in carbonate rocks (Skorpion, Namibia; Yanque, Peru), or characterized by other metals as main commodities, like lead (Magellan, Australia), silver (Sierra Mojada, Mexico; Wonawinta, Australia) or vanadium (Otavi Mountainland, Namibia). Minerals of current economic importance in most "Calamine" deposits are smithsonite, hydrozincite, and cerussite. This mineralogical association is generally simple but, when the "Calamines" are dolomite-hosted, one {{of the consequences of}} the "wall-rock replacement" process is the generation of {{a series of}} economically useless Zn- and Mg-bearing mixed carbonate phases. Secondary deposits hosted in silicatic (sedimentary or volcanic) rocks mainly contain hemimorphite and/or sauconite. Lead-, Ag- and V-rich nonsulfide ores are characterized by a more complex mineralogical association: mixed Pb-carbonates, Pb-sulfates, Pb- phosphates, Pb-arsenates, various Ag-sulfosalts, and Zn-Pb-Cu-vanadates. Carbon and oxygen stable isotope studies allow distinguishing between supergene and hypogene nonsulfide deposits, evaluating the effects of oxidative heating and even gaining indirect paleoclimatic information. The oxygen-isotope variation of the individual carbonate minerals within a deposit is relatively small, indicating constant formation temperatures and a single, meteoric fluid source. Carbon-isotope values are highly variable, thus suggesting several isotopically distinct carbon sources. Periods of paleoclimatic switch-overs from seasonally humid/arid to hyperarid have been considered as the most favorable conditions for the formation and preservation of supergene nonsulfide deposits. However, while several recent nonsulfide deposits throughout the world are positioned between 15 ° and 45 ° N latitude, thus pointing to a warm and humid weathering climate, others have been deposited in sub-Arctic regions. The economic value of the nonsulfide Zn(Pb-Ag-V) ores is highly variable, because more than in the case of metallic sulfide deposits, it resides not only on the geological setting, but also on their mineralogy that can directly influence processing and metallurgy...|$|E
