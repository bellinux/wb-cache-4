40|$|Research has title " The Effect of Brand Image Component in the XL-Bebas Card on Purchasing Decision (Study on Student of Economic Faculty of Malang Muhammadiyah University) ". Problems {{challenged}} by {{students will be}} how to select cellular card suitable to the expectation because students may remain as critical customer and experience mental and intellectual maturity process. Students involve within smart customer segment requiring some considerations before making their purchasing decision on product. The objective or research seems about understanding and analyzing the effect simultaneously of brand image components such as producer image, user image, and XL-Bebas card product image on purchasing decision among students of Malang Muhammadiyah University, and about examining and analyzing the effect of dominat brand image components on purchasing decision among students of Economic Faculty of Malang Muhammadiyah University in selecting XL-Bebas cellular card. Type of research considers survey. This kind of research employs explanatory research explaining the causal relationship between variables through hypothesis testing. Population of research includes active students of Economic Faculty of Malang Muhammadiyah University, Class of 2004 / 2007 in academic years 2008 - 2009, especially having experience of purchasing XL-Bebas cellular card. Minimum sample of research comprises to 70 respondents developed from non probability sampling through Accidental Sampling technique in which everybody observed by the researcher becomes research sample by the criterion of representation of being sample. Results of analysis indicate that: regression coefficient (b) of Producer <b>Image</b> variable (<b>X</b> 1) equals to 0. 097; regression coefficient (b 2) of User <b>Image</b> (<b>X</b> 2) variable counts to 0. 151; regresion coefficient (b 3) of Product <b>Image</b> variable (<b>X</b> 3) represents 0. 164. Results of research prove that Producer <b>Image</b> (<b>X</b> 1), User <b>Image</b> (<b>X</b> 2), and Product <b>Image</b> (<b>X</b> 3) simultaneously have significant effect on customer decision to purchase XL-Bebas cellular card. Research ensures the theory previously proposed by Gronroos (1990) that image development and improvement program has {{to be based on}} reality. If the image reflects company performance, the customer seems more loyal to product brand. Results of research proved that the product image has significantly dominant effect on customer decision in purchasing XL-Bebas cellular card. Reseacrh concludes that producer <b>image</b> (<b>X</b> 1), User <b>Image</b> (<b>X</b> 2), and Product <b>Image</b> (<b>X</b> 3) simultaneously have significant effect on customer decision to purchase XL-Bebas cellular card. Results of research also confirm that the product image has significantly dominant effect on customer decision to purchase XL-Bebas cellular card. ...|$|R
