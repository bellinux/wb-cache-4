They differ from each other in many technical aspects and therefore have strengths and weaknesses which can be rated in order to facilitate the evaluation of the optimum equipment configuration for a certain application. This paper specifically concentrates on the comparison of rotordynamic key figures like the logarithmic decrement (damping) of the lowest bending mode, the presence of overhung coupling modes within the speed range or the presence of torsional critical speeds which can be excited within the speed range and which therefore might adversely affect the integrity of the train components. The evaluated configurations include modern hermetically sealed, oil-free, magnetic bearing levitated compressor designs.

As our global population increases at an exponential rate and our consumerism grows with it, a sustainable source of energy needs to be developed to meet our power requirements. At this stage wind energy conversion systems (WECS) cannot produce power to the same scale as coal or gas fuelled power stations, but they do however offer the ability to operate as stand-alone power generation systems, reducing the need for long distance power transmission lines. Stand alone WECS are suitable electricity suppliers for isolated communities, island communities or applications where the cost of grid connection exceeds the installation and maintenance cost of a WECS. Small WECS can be configured to: - Feed into an existing grid - Supply charge to a battery bank - Directly power an appliance The prototype design incorporates: - 3 bladed aerofoil rotor - Adjustable blade pitch - Self governing speed regulation - <b>Speed</b> <b>increase</b> <b>gear</b> box - AC-induction generator – DC conversion circuit. - Steel tower The mechanical design was complimented by a functioning prototype of the Hub and rotor demonstrating {{the effectiveness of the}} power extraction mechanism.

Nonlinear dynamic equations are solved by Runge-Kutta method. Effect of backlash, crack in shaft and tooth wear faults on the nonlinear dynamic behavior of gear-shaft-bearing system is studied. The results show that gear-shaft-bearing system may change from periodic motion to non-periodic motion as backlash <b>increases,</b> and <b>gear</b> <b>pair</b> change from normal mesh to tooth separation, double-sided impact fault. If crack fault appears, quasi-periodic and chaos motion region increases, and gentle crack fault can result in instantaneous tooth separation and double-sided impact faults. Serious tooth wear fault will also induce tooth separation and double-sided impact faults. If both shaft crack and tooth wear faults exist, tooth wear fault will be intensified by double-sided impact fault from shaft crack, which will result in early failure of the gear system...|$|R

40|$|The {{lubrication}} regime in <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> is usually elasto-hydrodynamic, i. e. solid deformations {{due to the}} fluid pressure are not negligible. It {{is well known that}} lubrication in <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> depends upon a number of kinematical parameters, so that it is a non stationary EHD problem. Moreover, it depends upon the dynamic response (i. e. the dynamic load) of the <b>gear</b> <b>pair</b> [1 - 5]. The problem of finding the dynamic response in gear systems, especially spur gears, has been studied by many research works. Most of them consider as the main source of vibration the time variation of the number of teeth pairs that are in contact at the same time. This fluctuation makes the transmission more stiff, when two pair of teeth are in contact, more deformable when only one pair is in contact. This behaviour can cause oscillations of the gears, and eventually detachment of the teeth in contact, with impacts and noise.
