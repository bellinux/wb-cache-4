5000|$|Serum iron levels (i.e. iron {{not part}} of the {{hemoglobin}} in red cells) may be measured directly in the blood, but these levels increase immediately with iron supplementation (the patient must stop supplements for 24 hours), and pure blood-serum iron concentration, in any case, is not as sensitive as a combination of total serum iron, along with a measure of the serum iron-binding protein levels (TIBC). The ratio of serum iron to TIBC (called iron saturation or transferrin <b>saturation</b> <b>index</b> or percent) is the most specific indicator of iron deficiency when it is sufficiently low. The iron saturation (or transferrin saturation) of < 5% almost always indicates iron deficiency, while levels from 5% to 10% make the diagnosis of iron deficiency possible but not definitive. A transferrin saturation of 12% or more (taken alone) makes the diagnosis unlikely. Normal saturations are usually slightly lower for women (>12%) than for men (>15%), but this may indicate simply an overall slightly poorer iron status for women in the [...] "normal" [...] population.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{relationships}} between biliary lipid composition and cholesterol or triglyceride concentration in plasma lipoprotein fractions (i. e., very-low density, low-density, high-density, HDL 2 and HDL 3) {{have been studied}} in normolipaemic female gallstone patients. Univariate and multivariate stepwise statistical analyses were used to correlate biliary-tested variables against lipid lipoprotein concentration. Cholesterol <b>saturation</b> <b>index</b> {{was found to be}} positively and independently associated with total triglycerides, very-low-density lipoprotein triglycerides, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and furthermore, negatively, with HDL 3 -cholesterol. Percent biliary deoxycholate was positively correlated with both cholesterol <b>saturation</b> <b>index</b> and plasma very-low-density cholesterol or triglycerides. Neither cholesterol <b>saturation</b> <b>index</b> nor percent biliary deoxycholate showed any correlation with total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, HDL 2 -cholesterol. The present findings suggest a linkage between biliary deoxycholate, biliary cholesterol saturation and plasma very-low-density lipoprotein levels in gallstone patients. Furthermore, since the lipoprotein risk factors for coronary heart disease showed no correlation with cholesterol <b>saturation</b> <b>index,</b> these results were considered a biochemical proof against the supposed association between coronary heart disease and gallstone disease...|$|E
