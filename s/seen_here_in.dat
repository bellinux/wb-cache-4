500|$|An Adventurous Automobile Trip {{was one of}} Méliès's most {{successful}} films, and ran to acclaim at the Folies Bergère for six months.

[...] Before the game, Fincher said [...] "You're a great player Bo...I feel awful sorry about it because {{you are not going to}} be in there very long—about three minutes." [...] The Atlanta Constitution reported, [...] "McMillin's forward passes outdid anything of the kind <b>seen</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> many years, but Tech seemed to know where they were going".

500|$|Restaurants {{are popular}} in the area known as Le Midi. Oysters come from the Etang de Thau, to be served in the {{restaurants}} of Bouzigues, Meze, and Sète. Mussels are commonly <b>seen</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> addition to fish specialties of Sète, Bourride, Tielles and Rouille de seiche. In the Languedoc [...] jambon cru, sometimes known as jambon de montagne is produced. High quality Roquefort comes from the brebis (sheep) on the Larzac plateau. The Les Cévennes area offers mushrooms, chestnuts, berries, honey, lamb, game, sausages, pâtés and goat cheeses. [...] Catalan influence {{can be seen in}} the cuisine here with dishes like brandade made from a purée of dried cod wrapped in mangold leaves. Snails are plentiful and are prepared in a specific Catalan style known as a cargolade. Wild boar can be found in the more mountainous regions of the Midi.|$|E
2500|$|In 1820, Hokusai {{changed his}} name yet again, this time to [...] "Iitsu," [...] a change which marked {{the start of a}} period in which he secured fame as an artist {{throughout}} Japan. His most famous work, Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji, including the famous Great Wave off Kanagawa, was produced in the early 1830s. The results of Hokusai's perspectival studies in Manga can be <b>seen</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> The Great Wave off Kanagawa where he uses what would have been seen as western perspective to represent depth and volume. It proved so popular that Hokusai later added ten more prints to the series. Among the other popular series of prints he published during this time are A Tour of the Waterfalls of the Provinces, Oceans of Wisdom and Unusual Views of Celebrated Bridges in the Provinces. He also began producing a number of detailed individual images of flowers and birds, including the extraordinarily detailed Poppies and Flock of Chickens.|$|E

60|$|In {{the other}} {{there is the}} boldness and courage with which St. Paul {{undertook}} {{to talk to a}} set of men who, he knew, despised all the world, as thinking themselves able to teach them anything. In the audience there is anticipating pride and conceit in some, a smile or fleer of contempt in others, but a kind of sensible conviction, though crushed in its beginning, on the faces of the rest; and all together appear confounded, but have little to say, and know nothing at all of it; they gravely put him off to hear him another time; all these are <b>seen</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> the very dress of the face--that is, the very countenances which they hold while they listen to the new doctrine which the Apostle preached to a people at that time ignorant of it.|$|E

A large prime red fox will bring only four dollars to perhaps six or seven {{in a year when}} fur is scarce and high, and the fur of a black fox isn't any {{different}} or better. All that difference in price is because once in a blue moon Nature gets tired of red and tries black for a change, and people with more money than brains pay the price because it is rare and they can wear something that mighty few others can have. It's fox, just the same, and it will wear out just as quickly as if it were common every-day red. It's a fad.

60|$|She {{felt certain}} that she would marry Rodney. How could one avoid it? How could one find fault with it? Here she sighed, and, putting the thought of {{marriage}} away, fell into a dream state, in which she became another person, {{and the whole world}} seemed changed. Being a frequent visitor to that world, she could find her way there unhesitatingly. If she had tried to analyze her impressions, she would have said that there dwelt the realities of the appearances which figure in our world; so direct, powerful, and unimpeded were her sensations there, compared with those called forth in actual life. There dwelt the things one might have felt, had there been cause; the perfect happiness of which here we taste the fragment; the beauty <b>seen</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> flying glimpses only. No doubt much of the furniture of this world was drawn directly from the past, and even from the England of the Elizabethan age. However the embellishment of this imaginary world might change, two qualities were constant in it. It was a place where feelings were liberated from the constraint which the real world puts upon them; and the process of awakenment was always marked by resignation and a kind of stoical acceptance of facts. She met no acquaintance there, as Denham did, miraculously transfigured; she played no heroic part. But there certainly she loved some magnanimous hero, and as they swept together among the leaf-hung trees of an unknown world, they shared the feelings which came fresh and fast as the waves on the shore. But the sands of her liberation were running fast; even through the forest branches came sounds of Rodney moving things on his dressing-table; and Katharine woke herself from this excursion by shutting the cover of the book she was holding, and replacing it in the bookshelf.|$|E

6000|$|Some {{time after}} my return from Constantinople {{to this city}} I {{received}} the thirty-first number of the Edinburgh Review[245] as a great favour, and certainly at this distance an acceptable one, from the captain of an English frigate off Salamis. In that number, Art. 3, containing the review of a French translation of Strabo,[246] there are introduced some remarks on the modern Greeks and their literature, with a short account of Coray, a co-translator in the French version. On those remarks I mean to ground a few observations; and the spot where I now write will, I hope, be sufficient excuse for introducing them in a work in some degree connected with the subject. Coray, the most celebrated of living Greeks, at least among the Franks, was born at Scio (in the Review, Smyrna is stated, I have reason to think, incorrectly), and besides the translation of Beccaria and other works mentioned by the Reviewer, has published a lexicon in Romaic and French, if I may trust the assurance of some Danish travellers lately arrived from Paris; but the latest we have <b>seen</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> French and Greek is that of Gregory Zolikogloou.[247] Coray has recently been involved in an unpleasant controversy with M. Gail,[248] a Parisian commentator and editor of some translations from the Greek poets, in consequence of the Institute having awarded him the prize for his version of Hippocrates' [...] "Περὶ ὑδάτων [Peri\ y(da/tôn]," [...] etc., to the disparagement, and consequently displeasure, of the said Gail. To his exertions, literary and patriotic, great praise is undoubtedly due; but {{a part of that}} praise ought not to be withheld from the two brothers Zosimado (merchants settled in Leghorn), who sent him to Paris and maintained him, {{for the express purpose of}} elucidating the ancient, and adding to the modern, researches of his countrymen. Coray, however, is not considered by his countrymen equal to some who lived in the two last centuries; more particularly Dorotheus of Mitylene,[249] whose Hellenic writings are so much esteemed by the Greeks, that Meletius[250] terms him [...] "Μετὰ τὸν Θουκυδίδην καὶ Ξενοφώντα ἄριστος Ἑλλήνων [Meta\ to Thoukydi/dên kai\ Xenophô/nta a)/ristos E(llê/nôn]" [...] (p. 224, Ecclesiastical History, iv.).|$|E
