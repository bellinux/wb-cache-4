2500|$|The {{decision}} to use the banking hall for functions instead of serving as the hotel's lobby was financially driven by allowing the hotel to rent out the large hall for events. In the banking hall, the teller counter was removed despite being a [...] "character defining" [...] feature. The State Historic Preservation Office recommended that a <b>shadow</b> <b>line</b> of the counter be incorporated in the floor, but the recommendation was not carried out. The metal and glass wall that separates the mezzanines and the hall was required by safety code. The staircase that connects the mezzanine floors had been enclosed by a modern wall, but the wall was removed in the restoration. The 33rd-floor rooms, including the boardroom, were restored, {{and much of the}} original furniture was acquired by Loews. There were few distinct features of the building on the first floor so the developers used the area for the hotel lobby. Among other changes to the first floor was creating access to the lobby from the Market Street entrance.|$|E

30|$|Using a 64 -slice spiral CT scanner, we {{previously}} {{noticed that}} normal interlobular fissures presented as multiple parallel <b>shadow</b> <b>lines</b> in MIP-reconstructed images, {{while the number}} of <b>shadow</b> <b>lines</b> was equal to the ratio of the thickness of the MIP reconstruction layer to the thickness of the original layer. A five-line sign could be generated if the following parameters were adopted: 1.25 -mm layer thickness, 1.25 -mm space, and 6.25 -mm MIP slab thickness [6]. The five-line sign of interlobular fissures could be used to differentiate the underdeveloped interlobular fissures and the accessory fissures from pulmonary linear fibrosis.|$|R

40|$|In recent years, a {{sense of}} {{belonging}} has become a critical issue that provokes intense discussion among diasporic authors. Struggling for {{a sense of}} belonging, closely associated with issues of history, memory, and borders, reflects the colonized people’s current dilemma. In Amitav Ghosh’s The <b>Shadow</b> <b>Lines,</b> borders considered to be “shadow lines”, influence the individual and community. Some individuals revere the borders and feel that they can have {{a sense of belonging}} only if they are in their original homeland, while other individuals believe that one can create a sense of home wherever they are. This paper discusses the way in which Ghosh evokes the border in relation to personal and public identity in The <b>Shadow</b> <b>Lines</b> and also shows how, by using the imagination with precision, it is possible {{to create a sense of}} home and identity...|$|R
40|$|This essay {{critically}} {{examines the}} blurred boundaries – or the analytical <b>shadow</b> <b>lines</b> – in scholarly and popular conceptualizations of Asian women migrants. I ask what women who migrate {{from the global}} South to the North as maids, brides, or sex workers have in common? How important are the commonalities and the distinctions between them? When are such blurs warranted, {{and what are the}} implications of such blurs for women’s self-perceptions and life experiences, for feminist scholarship, and for immigration policies? Drawing from ethnographic field research among Chinese and Filipina correspondence brides, Filipina domestic workers, and from the wider literature on sex workers, this essay considers some of the problems with a ‘trafficking’ framework, and considers the analytical and ethnographic possibilities that emerge with closer examination of the real and imagined <b>shadow</b> <b>lines</b> between sex workers, domestic workers, and migrant brides...|$|R
40|$|<b>Shadowed</b> contour <b>lines</b> vary line width. Illuminated {{contour lines}} {{additionally}} vary color {{based on an}} angle of illumination. Illuminated and <b>shadowed</b> contour <b>lines</b> {{date back to the}} midnineteenth century, but their effectiveness compared to conventional contour lines has not been fully examined. Currently, illuminated and <b>shadowed</b> contour <b>lines</b> are not widely used in computer-based cartography because they are not included in most GIS apmaking software. This article introduces improvements to existing algorithms for creating illuminated and <b>shadowed</b> contour <b>lines</b> from digital elevation data. A software package is made available to allow mapmakers to more easily make customized illuminated and shadowed contour maps. A user study comparing illuminated and <b>shadowed</b> contour <b>lines</b> to conventional contour lines and shaded relief with approximately 400 participants was conducted. Results indicate that map-readers can interpret relative height differences between points better and quicker with illuminated contour lines than regular contour lines or shaded relief. Study participants were able to select absolute maxima on an unlabeled illuminated contour map and a labeled regular contour map with equal accuracy and speed. These findings suggest that illuminated contour lines could be used more frequently for improved visualization of terrain and other surface data on maps...|$|R
