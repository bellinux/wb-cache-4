5|$|Starfish are marine invertebrates. They {{typically}} have a central disc and five arms, though some species {{have a larger}} number of arms. The aboral or upper surface may be smooth, granular or spiny, and is covered with overlapping plates. Many species are brightly coloured in various shades of red or orange, while others are blue, grey or brown. Starfish have tube feet operated by a hydraulic system and a mouth at the centre of the oral or lower surface. They are opportunistic feeders and are mostly predators on benthic invertebrates. Several species have specialized feeding behaviours including eversion of their stomachs and suspension feeding. They have complex life cycles and can reproduce both sexually and asexually. Most can regenerate damaged parts or lost arms and they can shed arms as a means of defence. The Asteroidea occupy several significant ecological roles. Starfish, such as the ochre <b>sea</b> <b>star</b> (Pisaster ochraceus) and the reef <b>sea</b> <b>star</b> (Stichaster australis), have become widely known as examples of the keystone species concept in ecology. The tropical crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) is a voracious predator of coral throughout the Indo-Pacific region, and the northern Pacific <b>sea</b> <b>star</b> is considered {{to be one of the}} world's 100 worst invasive species.|$|E
25|$|Predators include predatory starfish {{such as the}} Ochre <b>Sea</b> <b>Star</b> (Pisaster ochraceous).|$|E
25|$|One dogma of {{intertidal}} ecology—supported by such classic studies—is that species' lower tide height {{limits are}} set by species interactions whereas their upper limits are set by climate variables. Classic studies by Robert Paine established that when <b>sea</b> <b>star</b> predators are removed, mussel beds extend to lower tide heights, smothering resident seaweeds. Thus, mussels' lower limits are set by <b>sea</b> <b>star</b> predation. Conversely, {{in the presence}} of sea stars, mussels' lower limits occur at a tide height at which sea stars are unable to tolerate climate conditions.|$|E

40|$|For {{a marine}} {{biologist}} strolling {{along the eastern}} coast of South America, finding some <b>sea</b> <b>stars</b> (popularly called starfish, and technically {{members of the class}} Asteroidea of the phylum Echinodermata) is not all that unusual. Howevel � when closer inspection reveals the <b>sea</b> <b>stars</b> to be ones that are also found on the shores of the western coast of Africa, the marine biologist now faces an interesting question: How did these <b>sea</b> <b>stars</b> come to be so far from home?

25|$|Increasing acidity has {{possibly}} harmful consequences, such as depressing metabolic {{rates in}} jumbo squid, depressing the immune responses of blue mussels, and coral bleaching. However it may benefit some species, for example increasing {{the growth rate}} of the <b>sea</b> <b>star,</b> Pisaster ochraceus, while shelled plankton species may flourish in altered oceans.|$|E
25|$|Although no {{invertebrates}} {{have been}} identified as endangered or vulnerable, it is important to acknowledge that there are a plethora of invertebrates within the Cape Byron Marine Park which are critical {{to the health of the}} local ecosystems. These include a variety of molluscs such as the gold ring cowries (Cypraea annulus), Crustaceans such as the Zebra Shrimp (Ganthophylum americanum) and a specimen of the seven armed <b>sea</b> <b>star</b> (Luidia australiae). These Invertebrates have been noted as they are not usually found in areas and climates such as the Cape Byron Marine Park. The Zebra Shrimp and the seven armed <b>sea</b> <b>star</b> are rarely found in intertidal habitats and the gold ring cowries share a tropical affinity and demonstrate a rare occurrence in which the Cape Byron Marine Park is a habitat for both temperate and tropical species.|$|E
25|$|Competition, {{especially}} for space, is another dominant interaction structuring intertidal communities. Space competition is especially fierce in rocky intertidal habitats, where habitable space is limited compared to soft-sediment habitats in which three-dimensional space is available. As {{seen with the}} previous <b>sea</b> <b>star</b> example, mussels are competitively dominant {{when they are not}} kept in check by <b>sea</b> <b>star</b> predation. Joseph Connell's research on two types of high intertidal barnacles, Balanus balanoides, now Semibalanus balanoides, and a Chthamalus stellatus, showed that zonation patterns could also be set by competition between closely related organisms. In this example, Balanus outcompetes Chthamalus at lower tide heights but is unable to survive at higher tide heights. Thus, Balanus conforms to the intertidal ecology dogma introduced above: its lower tide height limit is set by a predatory snail and its higher tide height limit is set by climate. Similarly, Chthamalus, which occurs in a refuge from competition (similar to the temperature refuges discussed above), has a lower tide height limit set by competition with Balanus and a higher tide height limit is set by climate.|$|E

25|$|Predators of Semibalanus balanoides {{include the}} whelk Nucella lapillus, the shanny Lipophrys pholis, the <b>sea</b> <b>star</b> Asterias vulgaris, and nudibranchs. Although {{they have no}} eyes, {{barnacles}} are aware of changes in light, and withdraw into their shells when threatened. Parasites of S. balanus include Pyxinoides balani, a protozoan which lives in the barnacle's midgut, and Epistylis horizontalis, a ciliate which lives on the gills. The isopod Hemioniscus balani occurs from France to the Faroe Islands and the Oslofjord, and from Labrador to Massachusetts, and is a parasite of S. balanoides, effectively castrating the barnacle if it is heavily infested. The lichens Arthropyrenia sublittoralis and Pyrenocollema halodytes may colonise the shells of barnacles.|$|E

5000|$|In aquariums, these <b>sea</b> <b>stars</b> like {{to climb}} around on glass and also filters, {{which they can}} disrupt. In public aquariums, these stars are {{sometimes}} target-fed with chopped squids, clams or shrimps, and are popular animals for touch pools as it is moderately large in number in some undisturbed areas. Horned <b>sea</b> <b>stars</b> need perfect water condition, suitable diet and proper acclimatization to thrive - thus, these <b>sea</b> <b>stars</b> sometimes do not fare very well. In reef aquariums, they are regarded as undesirable as they have destructive tendencies of toppling decors and digesting patches of corals and sessile organisms; they are reasonably safe if kept in a fish-only aquarium. However, the <b>sea</b> <b>stars</b> are desirable for their cute appearance and relatively non-aggressive behavior.|$|R

25|$|Echinoderms (such as the <b>sea</b> <b>star),</b> crayfish, many reptiles, and {{amphibians}} exhibit remarkable {{examples of}} tissue regeneration. The case of autotomy, for example, {{serves as a}} defensive function as the animal detaches a limb or tail to avoid capture. After the limb or tail has been autotomized, cells move into action and the tissues will regenerate. Limited regeneration of limbs occurs in most fishes and salamanders, and tail regeneration takes place in larval frogs and toads (but not adults). The whole limb of a salamander or a triton will grow again and again after amputation. In reptiles, chelonians, crocodilians and snakes are unable to regenerate lost parts, but many (not all) kinds of lizards, geckos and iguanas possess regeneration capacity in a high degree. Usually, it involves dropping a section of their tail and regenerating {{it as part of}} a defense mechanism. While escaping a predator, if the predator catches the tail, it will disconnect.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} {{sandstone}} rockshelfs and rock pools fringe the entire coastline and Port Hacking Estuary Line of the National Park broken on by small sandy beaches and gentle freshwater inlets. Some {{of the most}} commonly encountered molluscs in this habitat include black nerites (Nerita atramentosa), turbin snails (Turbo undulata), zebra snails (Austrocochlea porcata) as well as the commercially farmed Sydney rock oyster (Saccostrea glomerata). One of the most common and distinctive seaweed species that grow among the rock pools and the nearshore rockshelfs is Neptunes necklace (Hormosira banksii) a seaweed made of small buoyant fleshy bead-like structures which resemble strongly that of a necklace. Beds of the primitive sea-squirt cunjevoi (Pyura stolonifera) are common along coastal rockshelfs which are covered by high tide and near sea spray. Considered the most beautiful and obvious of the Royal National Parks' sea anemone is the waratah anemone (Actinia tenebrosa) named after the waratah flower due to its corresponding flame red coloration. A common sea-star found growing in the rock pools is the biscuit <b>sea</b> <b>star</b> (Tosia australis).|$|E

50|$|Some of {{the most}} prosperous forms of life at the Davenport Tide Pools are <b>Sea</b> <b>Stars.</b> This {{is due to the}} rifts and ridges up and down the tide pools, these allow <b>Sea</b> <b>Stars</b> to move father up the Tidal zone. Normally <b>Sea</b> <b>Stars</b> are subtidal organisms that live closer to the ocean, because they die when they become too dry. Their prey are Mussels that live up and down the tidal zone, since their hard shells allow them to live in drier areas for longer. The rifts and ridges at the Davenport Tide pools allow the <b>Sea</b> <b>Stars</b> to feed off of Mussels at higher tidal zones during lower tides. Since the Mussels are only a few inches above a rift that is level with the subtidal zone.|$|R
