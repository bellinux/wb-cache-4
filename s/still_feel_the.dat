25|$|Farmer Weaver was a catcher-outfielder for Louisville. I {{tipped his}} bat several {{times when he}} had two strikes on him one year, and each time the umpire called him out.

Sometimes I think I can <b>still</b> <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> pain. I'll tell you I didn't tip his bat again. No, sir, not until the last {{game of the season}} and Weaver was at bat for the last time. When he had two strikes, I tipped his bat again and got away with it.|$|E

500|$|The pagoda, which rises {{with five}} square {{terraces}} has a central solid core. The terraces rise steeply {{in the form}} of a pyramid topped with umbrellas or chatris. The entire edifice, from the base to the tip, appears like a cone. From the four cardinal directions there are steps from the base to the terraces at the centre to provide access to devotees to go up for worship; these terraces are fitted with instructions on slabs narrating events from the life of Buddha and other Buddhist scriptures. The interior, though conceived as a solid body, has a maze of interconnected narrow passages, where devotees affix dedicatory slabs on the walls by paying a donation, praying for special blessings.
