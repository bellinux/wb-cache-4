2500|$|Two of {{the owners}} whose homes were washed away {{at the point of}} the breach were unable to {{purchase}} flood insurance. They said that the city told them it was unnecessary, because the lake was dam-controlled. WISC-TV reported that the village had lost its eligibility for Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA's) National Flood Insurance Program after the village failed to formally adopt an updated floodplain map called a [...] "flood insurance rate map" [...] (the official map of a community on which FEMA has delineated both the <b>special</b> <b>hazard</b> areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the community). The village engineer and clerk said the map was not adopted because of [...] "gross inaccuracies" [...] in how FEMA had expanded the floodplain.|$|E

The Carolina Fire Department {{in collaboration with the}} Carolina Municipal Emergency Management use two engine trucks, one ladder track and one <b>special</b> <b>hazard</b> engine truck. Their headquarters are located in the tourist district of Isla Verde. Also, the Puerto Rico Fire Department have a fire station and regional office in town, located on the Roberto Clemente Avenue.|$|E
50|$|Contamination of {{medicinal}} plants with mycotoxins {{can contribute to}} adverse human health problems and therefore represents a <b>special</b> <b>hazard.</b> Numerous natural occurrences of mycotoxins in {{medicinal plants}} and herbal medicines have been reported from various countries including Spain, China, Germany, India, Turkey and from the Middle East. In a 2015 analysis of plant-based dietary supplements, the highest mycotoxin concentrations were found in milk thistle-based supplements, at up to 37 mg/kg.|$|E
5000|$|The ANSUL name is {{a premium}} brand of Tyco Fire Protection Products. The full line of ANSUL <b>special</b> <b>hazard</b> fire {{protection}} products includes fire extinguishers and hand line units; pre-engineered restaurant, vehicle, and industrial systems; sophisticated fire detection/suppression systems, and a complete line of dry chemical, foam, and gaseous extinguishing agents. [...] A common hand-held fire extinguisher produced by Ansul that many consumers may recognize is the SENTRY brand stored-pressure fire extinguisher.|$|E
50|$|Specific {{explosives}} (usually but {{not always}} highly sensitive on {{one or more of}} the three above axes) may be idiosyncratically sensitive to such factors as pressure drop, acceleration, the presence of sharp edges or rough surfaces, incompatible materials, or even—in rare cases—nuclear or electromagnetic radiation. These factors present <b>special</b> <b>hazards</b> that may rule out any practical utility.|$|R
50|$|A foam water fire {{sprinkler}} system is a special application system, discharging a mixture of water and low expansion foam concentrate, resulting in a foam spray from the sprinkler. These systems are usually used with <b>special</b> <b>hazards</b> occupancies associated with high challenge fires, such as flammable liquids, and airport hangars. Operation is as described above, depending on the system type into which the foam is injected.|$|R
50|$|The <b>special</b> <b>hazards</b> of {{traveling}} by rail include {{the possibility of}} a train crash which can result in substantial loss of life. Incidents involving freight traffic generally pose a greater hazardous risk to the environment. Less common hazards include geophysical hazards such as tsunami such as that which struck in 2004 in Sri Lanka when 1,700 people died in the Sri Lanka tsunami-rail disaster.|$|R
50|$|Excessive speed {{while driving}} through loose {{chippings}} damage both {{the road and}} vehicles. Loose chippings can reduce traction and cause loss of control. This is a <b>special</b> <b>hazard</b> to motorcyclists and bicyclists, who may lose their balance and fall if their tires start sliding. Loose chippings can {{be picked up by}} tyres and damage them, or may be spun off to become high speed missiles, which may injure or damage other persons or vehicles on the road.|$|E
50|$|Taxpayer {{buildings}} are {{criticized for being}} poorly or cheaply built, but allow a developer {{to stay in business}} while they wait for more favorable conditions. A fire in a taxpayer is a <b>special</b> <b>hazard</b> in firefighting. The poor quality construction often burns readily, and the architecture tends to encourage backdrafts. Many have been renovated several times over and have concealed or undocumented voids. More modern taxpayers were built with fire-resistant materials and are less of a hazard.|$|E
5000|$|... 24 February 1943: The {{squadron}} experienced {{its first}} encounter with the new German U-boat tactic of remaining on the surface to fight. Ensign W. J. Barnard sighted a U-boat torpedoing a ship. During his attack run against the submarine it surfaced and returned unusually heavy and accurate anti-aircraft (AA) fire. Ensign Barnard and his crew escaped injury, but {{lost track of the}} submarine on the return run. By this point in the war the German U-boats were being equipped with quad-mount 20-mm AA guns and presented a <b>special</b> <b>hazard</b> to aircrews pressing an attack when the element of surprise had been lost. Lieutenant Carey, Plane #6, was shot down in this manner in July 1943.|$|E

500|$|Finally, panicled aster (Symphyotrichum lanceolatum) is {{also present}} among the {{invasive}} plants. In their native countries, American asters {{are found in}} wet places. In France, these plants colonize relatively dry ruderal areas (brownfields, road shoulder ...) or wetlands. In this second case, asters show strong invasive behavior. In the reserve, {{where the majority of}} areas are dry, this plant does not present <b>special</b> <b>hazards</b> and removal is managed easily.|$|R
30|$|It is {{proposed}} {{to use the}} term „climate biomonitoring“ for biomonitoring methods that are able to indicate climate change effects. For several reasons (e.[*]g. unified methods, common data basis, cost reduction) all federal states should participate in it. Today, bioindication is an indispensable method for the early detection of changes in the biosphere, giving information about <b>special</b> <b>hazards</b> (early warning system). Climate biomonitoring preferably makes use of already existing monitoring systems and data collections.|$|R

5000|$|Second {{harmonic}} generation {{is used by}} the laser industry to make green 532 nm lasers from a 1064 nm source. The 1064 nm light is fed through a bulk KDP crystal. In high-quality diode lasers the crystal is coated on the output side with an infrared filter to prevent leakage of intense 1064 nm or 808 nm infrared light into the beam. Both of these wavelengths are invisible and do not trigger the defensive [...] "blink-reflex" [...] reaction in the eye and can therefore be a <b>special</b> <b>hazard</b> to the human eyes. Furthermore, some laser safety eyewear intended for argon or other green lasers may filter out the green component (giving a false sense of safety), but transmit the infrared. Nevertheless, some [...] "green laser pointer" [...] products have become available on the market which omit the expensive infrared filter, often without warning. Second {{harmonic generation}} is also used for measuring ultra short pulse width by means of intensity auto-correlation.|$|E
50|$|Though the IR from a DPSS laser is less collimated, {{the typical}} neodymium-doped {{crystals}} in such lasers do produce a true IR laser beam. The eye will usually {{react to the}} higher-powered visible light; however in higher power DPSS lasers the IR laser output can be significant. What poses a <b>special</b> <b>hazard</b> for this unfiltered IR output is its presence in conjunction with laser safety goggles designed to only block the visible wavelengths of the laser. Red goggles, for example, will block most green light from entering the eyes, but will pass IR light. The reduced light behind the goggles may also cause the pupils to dilate, increasing the hazard to the invisible IR light. Dual-frequency so-called YAG laser eyewear is significantly more expensive than single frequency laser eyewear, and is often not supplied with unfiltered DPSS pointer style lasers, which output 1064 nm IR laser light as well. These potentially hazardous lasers produce little or no visible beam when shone through the eyewear supplied with them, yet their IR-laser output can still be easily seen when viewed with an IR-sensitive video camera.|$|E
40|$|Influenza poses <b>special</b> <b>hazards</b> inside {{healthcare}} {{facilities and}} can cause explosive outbreaks of illness. Healthcare workers {{are at risk of}} acquiring influenza and thus serve as an important reservoir for patients under their care. Annual influenza immunisation of high-risk persons and their contacts, including healthcare workers, is the primary means of preventing nosocomial influenza. Despite influenza vaccine effectiveness, it is substantially underused by health-care providers. Influenza can be diagnosed by culturing the virus from respiratory secretions and by rapi...|$|R
40|$|Data {{and results}} {{summarized}} {{in this paper}} show that development of urban projects and design of flood control works in tropical island catchments must consider clear water flooding as well as <b>special</b> <b>hazards</b> such as landslides, flow bulking, high sediment concentrations, mud and debris flows and flow avulsions. The needs for and methods to estimate peak flows, event volumes and the potential extent and depths of flooding during severe storm events in urbanizing tropical environments are described...|$|R
5000|$|... "Deluge" [...] {{systems are}} systems {{in which all}} {{sprinklers}} connected to the water piping system are open, in that the heat sensing operating element is removed, or specifically designed as such. These systems are used for <b>special</b> <b>hazards</b> where rapid fire spread is a concern, as they provide a simultaneous application of water over the entire hazard. They are sometimes installed in personnel egress paths or building openings to slow travel of fire (e.g. openings in a fire-rated wall).|$|R
40|$|Reservoirs and dams {{are often}} {{situated}} in the mountains upstream of cities and towns. This implies a theoretical but difficult to evaluate hazard potential for downstream communities.

40|$|NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) is {{evaluating}} {{options of}} reuse of its historic Hangar 1. As {{a part of}} this evaluation, a qualitative fire risk assessment study was performed to evaluate the potential threat of combustion of the historic hangar. The study focused on the fire risk trade-off of either installing or not installing a <b>Special</b> <b>Hazard</b> Fire Suppression System in the Hangar 1 deck areas. The assessment methodology was useful in discussing the important issues among various groups within the Center. Once the methodology was deemed acceptable, the results were assessed. The results showed that the risk remained in the same risk category, whether Hangar 1 does or does not have a <b>Special</b> <b>Hazard</b> Fire Suppression System. Note that the methodology assessed the risk to Hangar 1 and not the risk to an aircraft in the hangar. If one had a high value aircraft, the aircraft risk analysis could potentially show a different result. The assessed risk results were then communicated to management and other stakeholders...|$|E
40|$|Dam {{safety is}} a {{perpetual}} issue everywhere, when communities are located downstream of dams. This paper reflects {{experiences of the}} related practice and considerations in Germany.
