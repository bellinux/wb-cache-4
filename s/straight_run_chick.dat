40|$|Aim: The aim was {{to assess}} the {{efficacy}} of pine leaves as an alternative bedding material on the performance of broiler chicks. Materials and Methods: The present study was conducted in summer. Total 120, day old Vencobb <b>straight</b> <b>run</b> <b>chicks</b> were procured, and after 5 days of brooding, chicks were randomly distributed into four treatment groups viz. paddy husk (Group I), paddy straw (Group II), pine leaves (Group III), and combination of paddy straw and pine leaves (Group IV), each having 30 chicks with 3 replicates of 10 chicks each. Chicks were reared under intensive conditions in houses that have a semi-controlled environment, with optimum temperature and adequate ventilation. Food and water were provided as per NRC (1994) requirement. Results: The average body weight after 6 weeks of the experiment was 2018. 83 ± 31. 11, 1983. 80 ± 33. 27, 2007. 36 ± 35. 73, and 1938. 43 ± 36. 35 g. The bedding type had no significant effect on the carcass characteristics viz. evisceration rate and proportion of cut-up parts of the carcass except giblet yield. The experiment suggested that performance of broiler chicks reared on paddy straw and pine leaves as litter material, had improved body weight and feed conversion ratio as compared to rearing on paddy husk as bedding material. Bacterial count, parasitic load and the N, P, K value of manure of different bedding material shows no significant difference. Conclusion: Pine leaves have a potential to be used as an alternative source of litter material to economize poultry production in a sustainable way, so as to make poultry farming as a profitable entrepreneur...|$|R

A completely randomized design was used with 10 chicks (chick was experimental unit) assigned to each of 9 dietary treatments from hatch to 28 days. The aflatoxin used for this study was supplied by Aspergillus parasiticus (NRRL- 2999) culture material (815 mg AFB 1 /kg). The dietary treatments included: 1) basal diet containing no AFB 1); 2) basal diet supplemented with 1. 5 mg AFB 1 /kg diet; 3) As diet 2 plus Product 1; 4) As diet 2 plus Product 2; 5) As diet 2 plus Product 3; 6) As diet 2 plus Product 4; 7) As diet 2 plus Product 5; 8) As diet 2 plus Product 6; and 9) As diet 2 plus Product 7. The addition of Products 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 to AF diets did not prevent the reduction in body weight gain (BWG) due to AFB 1. Chicks fed diets containing Products 1 thru 6 all had lower BWG (P >. 05) compared with control chicks. Body weight gain of birds fed Product 7 was not significantly different (P >. 05) from the birds fed the positive control; however, it was also not significantly different (P >. 05) from birds fed AF B 1 alone.

In this study <b>straight</b> <b>run</b> naphtha derived from Arabian Light crude oil was fractionated, and the hydrocarbon composition of its different distillation cuts was determined. The results indicate that, <b>straight</b> <b>run</b> naphtha can be split into two main fractions. A light fraction boiling between ambient temperature and 225 degrees F, consists mainly of C- 7 ((-)) and a medium heavy fraction boiling between 225 degrees F and 335 degrees F, consists mainly of C- 7 ((+)). Detailed distillation characteristics, along with compositional analysis of SRN seems to be useful for diversifying its processin...|$|R
