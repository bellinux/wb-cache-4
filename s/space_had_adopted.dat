40|$|The ongoing underutilisation of {{immigrant}} skills {{has become a}} topical issue for researchers and policy-makers alike. Within Australia, the majority of studies conducted in this <b>space</b> <b>have</b> <b>adopted</b> either the immigrant or policy-maker perspective, and have utilised human capital theory or labour market segmentation theory to explain the phenomenon. This paper contributes to the existing literature by proposing a novel occupation-specific approach focusing on the employer as a central player in determining labour market outcomes. In this exploratory study, {{interviews were conducted with}} 21 employers of accounting and IT employers in the regional city of Wollongong, Australia. The findings suggest that employers of accountants held a greater preference for Australian work experience and qualifications; communication skills beyond English language skills; and emphasised person- organisation fit over person-job fit. Conversely, employers {{of immigrant}} IT professionals were more tolerant of overseas- based qualifications and experience; were willing to accept candidates with 2 ̆ 7 sub-standard 2 ̆ 7 communication skills; and were open to personal attribute variations. Immigrant accounting professionals were therefore more likely than their IT counterparts to experience disadvantage when seeking employment opportunities in Australia; a finding that represents important implications for immigrant professionals, policy-makers and employers...|$|R

40|$|Debris in <b>space</b> <b>has</b> {{become an}} issue that has {{commanded}} considerable interest in recent years as society has become both more dependent upon space based systems, and more aware of its dependence. After many years of study the United States Space Policy of February 1988 directed that all sectors of the U. S. community minimize space debris. Other <b>space</b> organizations <b>have</b> <b>adopted</b> similar policies. Among the study activities leading to the policy and to subsequent implementing directives were discussions with the ESA, NASDA, and other space operating agencies.

40|$|A novel {{algorithm}} {{for very}} high compression of grayscale images presenting features {{that lead to}} power efficient implementations is proposed. A simple methodology based on a hierarchical three- stage exploration of the algorithmic design <b>space</b> <b>has</b> been <b>adopted</b> for the conception of the algorithm. The proposed algorithm {{is based on an}} integer wavelet transform, which is much more efficient in terms of data storage and transfer compared to the widely used real wavelet transforms. For the coding of the coefficients of the wavelet transform fractal techniques using small size computationally generated codebooks are applied. The performance of the proposed algorithm is comparable to or better than that of existing standard algorithms. It is estimated using state-ofthe -art high-level power estimation techniques that the proposed algorithm achieves lower power consumption by several times compared to existing standard algorithms. 1...|$|R
50|$|Because of the {{increasing}} number of objects in <b>space,</b> NASA <b>has</b> <b>adopted</b> guidelines and assessment procedures {{to reduce the number of}} non-operational spacecraft and spent rocket upper stages orbiting the Earth. One method of postmission disposal is to allow reentry of these spacecraft, either from orbital decay (uncontrolled entry) or with a controlled entry. Orbital decay may be achieved by firing engines to lower the perigee altitude so that atmospheric drag will eventually cause the spacecraft to enter. However, the surviving debris impact footprint cannot be guaranteed to avoid inhabited landmasses. Controlled entry normally occurs by using a larger amount of propellant with a larger propulsion system to drive the spacecraft to enter the atmosphere at a steeper flight path angle. It will then enter at a more precise latitude, longitude, and footprint in a nearly uninhabited impact region, generally located in the ocean.|$|R

40|$|A new {{approach}} for estimating and tracking the azimuth angle regarding north and a two-dimensional {{position of a}} mobile unit is presented. Outdoors, the azimuth angle of a device can be easily detected using an electronic compass and the position can be calculated using a global navigation satellite system (GNSS). Indoors, magnetic disturbances lead to unreliable compass outputs. Also, indoors there exists no standard positioning system like GNSS outdoors. The presented approach is based on Wi-Fi signal strength measurements collected by four horizontally arranged directional antennas. To proof the concept the well known Wi-Fi fingerprinting based on the normalized Euclidean distance in signal <b>space</b> <b>has</b> been <b>adopted.</b> A test with measurements collected in a laboratory demonstrates the feasibility of the approach. Especially in indoor environments this facilitates the use of electronic guides that offer additional information by means of augmented reality, e. g. on museum exhibits in visual range...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Vehicle {{suspension}} design must fulfill some conflicting criteria. Among {{those is}} ride comfort which is attained by minimizing the acceleration {{transmitted to the}} sprung mass, via suspension spring and damper. Also good handling of a vehicle is a desirable property which requires stiff suspension and therefore is in contrast with a vehicle with good ride. Among the other desirable features of a suspension is the minimization of the maximum travel of suspension. This travel which is called suspension working space in vehicle dynamics literature is also a design constraint and it favors good ride. In this research a full car 8 degrees of freedom model has been developed and the three above mentioned criteria, namely: ride, handling and working <b>space</b> <b>has</b> been <b>adopted</b> as objective functions.

40|$|Immersive and {{persistent}} 3 D virtual <b>spaces</b> <b>have</b> been <b>adopted</b> for e-learning in higher education. These spaces involve multi-sensory, real-time interactivity with other learners through high-fidelity, human-embodied avatars {{as well as}} automated ‘bots; these involve virtual contexts that situate various types of learning. Practitioners have discussed promoting immersive addictions to support long-term, deep-transfer, and complex systems-based learning. The social presences of human-embodied avatars, in individuals and groups, and their communications-heavy interactivity, have encouraged the development of parasocial relationships in several forms: self-love of people for their own avatars (which they may build up {{with a range of}} attractive features and digital powers), and other-love for others’ online personas. Understanding the parasocial spectrum will be important for those heading into immersive multiverses, especially with campuses starting to offer full-service virtual and distance support systems that encourage distance learning without the hybrid / blended or any aspect of face-to-face (F 2 F). This position paper explores ways to build immersive learning and to communicate to elicit the salutary parasocial effects while avoiding possible negative ones...|$|R

30|$|In many data {{analysis}} tasks, one is often confronted with very high dimensional data. The manifold assumption, {{which states that}} the data is sampled from a submanifold embedded in much higher dimensional Euclidean <b>space,</b> <b>has</b> been widely <b>adopted</b> by many researchers. In the last 15 years, {{a large number of}} manifold learning algorithms have been proposed. Many of them rely on the evaluation of the geometrical and topological of the data manifold. In this paper, we present a review of these methods on a novel geometric perspective. We categorize these methods by three main groups: Laplacian-based, Hessian-based, and parallel field-based methods. We show the connection and difference between these three groups on their continuous and discrete counterparts. The discussion is focused on the problem of dimensionality reduction and semi-supervised learning.|$|R

For example, the <b>Space</b> Agencies <b>have</b> attempted to increase the returns on their investments in space missions by encouraging the commercial use of advanced technologies. The development of a technology transfer process from Space to Earth not only benefits the aerospace industry but also the network of national companies. Indeed the latter are in an advantageous position due to the technological knowledge and R&D structures present in the Space Agencies and in the system integrator firms {{that are part of the}} space sector. These factors permit them to generate innovation and enjoy competitive advantages. The primary aim of the Japanese Space Agency (JAXA) is to consolidate and develop the industrial system in its country by means of technology transfer programs. The Japanese situation is particularly interesting because its <b>space</b> sector <b>has</b> always been organized to promote the process of technology transfer, and also because its agency (JAXA) has an important R&D laboratory. While most of the Space Agencies in the world are limited to the facilitator role of marketing, coordination and financing, JAXA is also able to develop space technologies. The aim of this paper is to investigate who the actors are and the nature of their role, and how the TT process is organized in the Japanese <b>space</b> sector. We <b>have</b> <b>adopted</b> an explorative research approach, investigating two cases of TT promoted by JAXA and supported by Mitsubishi, one of the most important system integrator companies...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{demonstrates}} how computations in {{finite element method}} {{can be interpreted as}} orthogonal projections of the analytical strains in each element. The Function <b>Space</b> Approach <b>has</b> been <b>adopted</b> to derive a priori estimates of the element strains and errors in finite element analysis. Simple one-dimensional bar and beam elements have been used to illustrate the fundamental principles that guide finite element computations in conservative or self-adjoint problems. Elements with constant and varying cross-sections have been considered. Results predicted are compared with numerical values obtained from standard computer codes. The interesting pathological problem of shear locking in linear Timoshenko beam element has been addressed. An explanation for locking and method to eliminate it have been presented. The rationale behind the practice of using reduced integration for elimination of locking has been revealed explicitly using the rigorous Function Space Approach. Finite element analysis can be regarded as a tool for obtaining approximate solution to differential equations of boundary value problems, using piecewise assumed interpolation functions within the domain of interest. The finite element equations are conventionally derived from the principles o...|$|R
