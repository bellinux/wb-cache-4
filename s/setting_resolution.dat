40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) array for an implantable neural sensor which digitizes neural signals sensed by a microelectrode array. The ADC array consists of 96 variable resolution ADC base cells. The resolution of each ADC {{cell in the}} array is varied according to neural data content of the signal from the corresponding electrode. The resolution adaptation algorithm is essentially to periodically recalibrate the required resolution and this is done without requiring any additional ADC cells. The adaptation implementation and results are described. The base ADC cell is implemented using a successive approximation charge redistribution architecture. The choice of architecture and circuit design are presented. The base ADC has been implemented in 0. 13 m CMOS as a 100 kS/s SAR ADC whose resolution can be varied from 3 to 8 bits with corresponding power consumption of 0. 23 W to 0. 90 W achieving an ENOB of 7. 8 at the 8 -bit setting. The energy per conversion step figure of merit is 48 fJ/step at the 8 -bit <b>setting.</b> <b>Resolution</b> adaptation reduces power consumption {{by a factor of}} 2. 3 for typical motor neuron signals while maintaining an effective 7. 8 -bit resolution across all channels.

The current study evaluated the effects of variations in screen size, resolution, and presentation delay on verbal and mathematics scores in a sample of 357 college-bound high school juniors. The students were {{randomly assigned to one of}} six experimental conditions—three screen display conditions crossed with two presentation rate conditions. The three display conditions were: 17 inch monitor <b>set</b> to a <b>resolution</b> of 1024 x 768, 17 -inch monitor <b>set</b> to a <b>resolution</b> of 640 x 480, and a 15 -inch monitor <b>set</b> to a <b>resolution</b> of 640 x 480. Items were presented either with no delay or with a five-second delay between questions (to emulate a slow Internet connection). No significant effects on math scores were found.

I repeat here to-day, that I never in any possible form had anything to do with that <b>set</b> of <b>resolutions.</b> It turns out, I believe, that those resolutions were never passed at any convention held in Springfield. It turns out that they were never passed at any convention or any public meeting that I had any part in. I believe it turns out, in addition to all this, that there was not, in the fall of 1854, any convention holding a session in Springfield calling itself a Republican State convention; yet it is true there was a convention, or assemblage of men calling themselves a convention, at Springfield, that did pass some resolutions. But so little did I really know of the proceedings of that convention, or what <b>set</b> of <b>resolutions</b> they had passed, though having a general knowledge that there had been such an assemblage of men there, that when Judge Douglas read the resolutions, I really did not know but that they had been the resolutions passed then and there. I did not question that they were the resolutions adopted. For I could not bring myself to suppose that Judge Douglas could say what he did upon this subject without knowing that it was true. I contented myself, on that occasion, with denying, as I truly could, all connection with them, not denying or affirming whether they were passed at Springfield. Now it turns out that he had got hold of some resolutions passed at some convention or public meeting in Kane County. I wish to say here, that I don't conceive that in any fair and just mind this discovery relieves me at all. I had just as much to do with the convention in Kane County as that at Springfield. I am just as much responsible for the resolutions at Kane County as those at Springfield, the amount of the responsibility being exactly nothing in either case; no more than there would be in regard to a <b>set</b> of <b>resolutions</b> passed in the moon.|$|R

Thus complex, interactive deformations become possible without a costly preprocessing or the necessity to reduce the data <b>set</b> <b>resolution.</b> For cutting operations we provide a template-based interaction technique which supports precise control of the cutting parameters.
