40|$|Four commercially available, medium {{pressure}} mercury <b>sun</b> <b>lamps</b> {{were used to}} assess their effects on promoting vitamin D synthesis in the skin. It was found that all the lamps studied had vitamin D synthesizing spectral wavelengths and caused an increase in the serum concentrations of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D.

It was not surprising, therefore, to find that these lamps caused adverse skin reactions.

40|$|Various {{kinds of}} {{butterflies}} raise both (or sometimes one) of their pairs of wings while basking with their body at approximately {{right angles to}} the incident solar radiation and with their wings held at an acute angle to the incident sunlight. I here test the effects of wing posture on thoracic temperature in so-called 'reflectance' basking. 1. Butterflies with pale yellow or white dorsal wing surfaces held with their wings at 45, 90 or 180 ° with {{respect to each other}} (or 22 - 23, 45 and 90 ° with respect to the solar radiation) heated to mean thoracic temperatures (Tth) of 38. 2, 39. 5 and 39. 9 °C, respectively, in direct sunlight. These closely similar values of T^ are significantly different (P< 0. 02) from each other, but the difference is in the opposite direction to that predicted by the solar reflectance hypothesis. 2. The r t h of butterflies tested under a <b>sun</b> <b>lamp</b> in the laboratory showed the same trend of r t h with wing angle. Reflectance from the wings thus makes little or no practical contribution to the animal's heating response. 3. Butterflies with wings at 45 ° that were heated from above with a <b>sun</b> <b>lamp</b> showed an immediate increase in Tth when turned at right angles to a gentle air stream. Thoracic temperature immediately declined when they were again turned to face the air stream. 4. Those butterflies that were at right angles to the air stream showed an immediate increase in Tth when the wings were raised from 180 to 45 °, and their r t h again declined to previous values when the wings were again lowered. However, little or no effect of wing angle on 7 "th was observed when the wing angle of butterflies parallel to the air stream was altered. These results indicate that wing elevation in basking butterflies does not increase Tth by way of solar reflection from the wings. Instead, the raised wings increase Tth by reducing convective cooling. 'Reflectance ' basking is a form of dorsal basking used by species of butterflies that perch above vegetation rather than above a heated substratum...|$|E
40|$|Because of a {{possible}} etiologic link between mutations and carcinogenesis, we compared fibroblasts derived from skin biopsies of several patients with hereditary cutaneous malignant melanoma and the dysplastic nevus syndrome for sensitivity to the mutagenic and/or cytotoxic effect of broad-spectrum simulated sunlight and of a UV mimetic carcinogen, 4 -nitroquinoline 1 -oxide (4 NQO). The genetic marker was resistance to 6 -thioguanine; loss of colony-forming ability was the assay for cytotoxicity. All five strains tested were more sensitive than normal to the killing effect of 4 NQO (slopes of survival curves were 2 - to 3 -fold steeper), but only one strain was hypersensitive to killing by <b>Sun</b> <b>Lamp</b> radiation. Two strains were tested for mutagenicity. The response of each to the mutagenic action of these agents corresponded to its response to cell killing. Both strains were hypermutable after exposure to 4 NQO, but only one showed a higher than normal frequency of mutants induced by simulated sunlight. The finding that nonmalignant fibroblasts from patients with a hereditary variant of malignant melanoma are abnormally susceptible to carcinogen-induced mutations suggests that hypersensitivity to mutagens contributes to risk of melanoma in patients. It also supports the somatic cell mutation hypothesis for the origin of cancer...|$|E
40|$|Acetone-sensitized {{irradiation}} using UV-B (<b>sun</b> <b>lamp,</b> lambda max = 313 nm) of deoxyfluorouridylyl-(3 '- 5 ') -thymidine monophosphate (d-FpT, F = fluorouracil), produces {{two major}} photoproducts, the cis-syn cyclobutane-type photodimer and a defluorinated (5 - 5) photoadduct, d-U 5 p 5 T. Product distribution {{is dependent on}} the pH of the irradiation solution, as was the case of irradiated d-TpF. At high pH (8 - 10) the (5 - 5) photoadduct is the major photoproduct. Irradiation of d-FpT shows a much faster photodegradation rate than the sequence isomer d-TpF. Multinuclear NMR experiments establish the formation of (5 - 5) covalent bonding between the C 5 (d-U 5 p-, where the fluorine had been) and the C 5 (-p 5 T) and the C 6 (-p 5 T) acquires an OH group. NOE interproton distances and dihedral angles derived from J coupling analysis are constrained to refine model structures of d-U 5 p 5 T in restrained molecular dynamics calculations. The resultant structures obtained show 5 S- 6 S as the most chiralities of the C 5 and C 6 atoms of the thymine, which is the opposite chirality to the corresponding atoms in the sequence isomer d-T 5 p 5 U. The orientation of the C 5 substituents (-p 5 T fragment), the CH 3 and the uracil are pseudo-axial and pseudo-equatorial respectively. Glycosidic angles are in the anti regions for both the d-U 5 p- and -p 5 T residues. Averaged backbone conformations of the two photoadducts, d-U 5 p 5 T and d-T 5 p 5 U, are similar, although the overall structure of d-U 5 p 5 T appears much more flexible than that of d-T 5 p 5 U.

Hairless mice received diets supplemented with either butylated hydroxytoluene, disulfiram, phenobarbital, glutathione (reduced), or a special antioxidant mixture for 2 weeks before irradiation with FS- 20 fluorescent <b>sun</b> <b>lamps.</b> Epidermal ornithine decarboxylase activity, the induction {{of which is}} thought to be a necessary component of skin tumor promotion, was determined at designated post-irradiation periods. Significant inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase induction was found in epidermis from animals receiving diets containing butylated hydroxytoluene, at physiological concentrations, had no effect upon ornithine decarboxylase activity when added directly to the reaction mixture. Nor did this compound, when provided in the diet of animals, evoke a notable effect upon 12 - 0 -teradcanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate induced ornithine decarboxylase. The latter finding suggests that dietary butylated hydroxytoluene inhibition of ultraviolet light-induced ornithine decarboxylase is a response related directly to the degree of irradiation insult rather than a general effect upon the processes associated with carcinogenic promotion...|$|R

40|$|Ultraviolet {{radiation}} (UVR) {{is known}} to suppress immune responses in human subjects. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop dose responses across a broad range of skin pigmentation in order to facilitate risk assessment. UVR was administered using FS 20 bulbs. Skin pigmentation and UVR sensitivity were evaluated using Fitzpatrick classifications, minimal erythemal dose (MED), slope of the erythemal dose response curve (sED), baseline pigmentation and tanning response. To assess immune responses dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) was applied to irradiated buttock skin 72 h after irradiation. Two weeks later DNCB was applied to the inside upper arm. Skin thickness was measured before and after challenge. Dose response was modeled (to obtain a regression line) for the entire group of 185 subjects. With the exception of sED none of the above-mentioned pigmentation indicators contributed significantly to variability around the regression line. Thus, differences in sensitivity for multiple skin types based on Fitzpatrick classification or MED were not observed. However, differences in immune sensitivity to UVR were detected between subjects with steep erythemal dose response curves and those with moderate or flat responses. For subjects with steep erythemal responses the dose calculated to suppress the immune response by 50 % was 114 mJ/cm 2. This group included individuals with Fitzpatrick skin types I–V, MED for these subjects ranged from 30 to 80 mJ/cm 2. The 50 % suppression dose for subjects with weak or no erythemal response could not be computed (the dose response was flat). This resistant group included subjects with skin types IV–VI and MED for these subjects ranged from 41 to > 105 mJ/cm 2.
