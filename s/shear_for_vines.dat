40|$|Three {{different}} {{green cover}} treatments were compared in {{their effect on}} leaf gas-exchange, vine growth, yield and fruit composition. The treatments were: grass cover, resident plants, and an insectary plant mixture. Photosynthesis, transpiration, and water use efficiency were lower <b>for</b> <b>vines</b> with a grass cover. Leaf area and shoot growth did not show a response to green cover treatment. There were no treatment responses in yield and yield components except for mean berry weights which were lower <b>for</b> <b>vines</b> with a grass cover. There were no differences in must soluble solids or total sugar per vine. Titratable acidity was higher <b>for</b> <b>vines</b> with a resident plant cover and pH was higher <b>for</b> <b>vines</b> with an insectary plant cover. The results reflect, to some extent, the higher degree of root zone competition experienced by vines with a grass cover...|$|R

40|$|Three {{different}} {{cover crop}} treatments were compared for {{their effects on}} vine growth, leaf gas exchange, yield parameters and fruit composition. The treatments were: resident plants, an insectary plant mixture and a grass cover. At veraison (August 21), photosynthesis rate was lowest <b>for</b> the <b>vines</b> with the grass cover treatment, whereas transpiration rate tended to be higher. Water use efficiency was lowest <b>for</b> <b>vines</b> with a grass cover on all three measurement days (post bloom, berries pea-sized, veraison).
