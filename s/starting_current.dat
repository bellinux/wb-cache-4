50|$|An {{induction}} motor draws very high <b>starting</b> <b>current</b> during its acceleration to full rated speed, typically 6 to 10 times the full load current. Reduced <b>starting</b> <b>current</b> is desirable where the electrical grid {{is not of}} sufficient capacity, or where the driven load cannot withstand high starting torque. One basic method to reduce the <b>starting</b> <b>current</b> is with a reduced voltage autotransformer with taps at 50%, 65% and 80% of the applied line voltage; once the motor is started the autotransformer is switched out of circuit.|$|E

50|$|DOL {{starting}} {{is sometimes}} used to start small water pumps, compressors, fans and conveyor belts. In {{the case of}} an asynchronous motor, such as the 3-phase squirrel-cage motor, the motor will draw a high <b>starting</b> <b>current</b> until it has run up to full speed. This <b>starting</b> <b>current</b> is typically 6-7 times greater than the full load current. To reduce the inrush current, larger motors will have reduced-voltage starters or variable speed drives in order to minimise voltage dips to the power supply.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: It is well {{understood}} that induction motors draw higher <b>currents</b> during their <b>starting</b> operations {{than is the}} case under full load running conditions. Since {{the early days of}} induction motor availability, starting methods other than Direct-on-Line have been used, and in some cases mandated by Utilities, to reduce the effect of these high <b>starting</b> <b>currents</b> on the electrical distribution network. What is generally not recognized is the existence of short duration inrush currents, which greatly exceed these <b>starting</b> <b>currents.</b> Furthermore, the introduction of complex starting methods to reduce <b>starting</b> <b>currents</b> is often compromised by other unanticipated inrush currents introduced by the starting system itself, unless special precautions are taken.

40|$|Abstract—The design, operation, and {{characterization}} of a continuous-wave (CW) tunable second-harmonic 460 -GHz gy-rotron are reported. The gyrotron {{is intended to}} be used as a submillimeter-wave source for 700 -MHz nuclear magnetic reso-nance experiments with sensitivity enhanced by dynamic nuclear polarization. The gyrotron operates in the whispering-gallery mode TE 11, 2 and has generated 16 W of output power with a 13 -kV 100 -mA electron beam.

50|$|It is {{important}} to synchronize the winches. Modern systems use electrical control and drive systems for the winches.

50|$|As {{with any}} switch, the contact current (unrelated to the coil current) must not exceed a given value to avoid damage. In high-inductance {{circuits}} such as motors, other issues must be addressed. When an inductance {{is connected to}} a power source, an input surge current or electromotor <b>starting</b> <b>current</b> larger than the steady-state current exists. When the circuit is broken, the current cannot change instantaneously, which creates a potentially damaging arc across the separating contacts.|$|E

50|$|To {{observe the}} effect of Back-EMF of a motor, one can perform this simple exercise. With an {{incandescent}} light on, cause a large motor such as a drill press, saw, air conditioner compressor, or vacuum cleaner to start. The light may dim briefly as the motor starts. When the armature is not turning (called locked rotor) there is no Back-EMF and the motor's current draw is quite high. If the motor's <b>starting</b> <b>current</b> is high enough it will pull the line voltage down enough to notice the dimming of the light.|$|E

50|$|A Liquid Resistor is an {{electrical}} resistor {{in which the}} resistive element is a liquid. Fixed-value liquid resistors are typically used where very high power dissipation is required. They {{are used in the}} rotor circuits of large slip ring induction motors to control <b>starting</b> <b>current,</b> torque and to limit large electrical fault currents (while other protection systems operate to clear or isolate the fault). They typically have electrodes made of welded steel plate (galvanised to reduce corrosion), suspended by insulated connections in a conductive chemical solution held in a tank - which may be open or enclosed. The tank body is normally solidly grounded or earthed. A typical unit can be rated for continuous use, or for short periods when used for current limitation in protection systems.|$|E
50|$|Two or more {{contactors}} {{may be used}} {{to provide}} reduced voltage starting of a motor. By using an autotransformer or a series inductance, a lower voltage is present at the motor terminals, reducing starting torque and inrush current. Once the motor has come up to some fraction of its full-load speed, the starter switches to full voltage at the motor terminals. Since the autotransformer or series reactor only carries the heavy motor <b>starting</b> <b>current</b> for a few seconds, the devices can be much smaller compared to continuously rated equipment. The transition between reduced and full voltage may be based on elapsed time, or triggered when a current sensor shows the motor current has begun to reduce. An autotransformer starter was patented in 1908.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of thermal {{overload}} relay. In one type, a bi-metallic strip located close to a heater deflects as the heater temperature rises until it mechanically causes the device to trip and open the circuit, cutting power to the motor should it become overloaded. A thermal overload will accommodate the brief high <b>starting</b> <b>current</b> of a motor while accurately protecting it from a running current overload. The heater coil and the action of the bi-metallic strip introduce a time delay that affords the motor time to start and settle into normal running current without the thermal overload tripping. Thermal overloads can be manually or automatically resettable depending on their application and have an adjuster that allows them to be accurately set to the motor run current.|$|E

The profile question “Month <b>started</b> <b>current</b> course” was completed in 15.61 seconds. The detailed analysis of answers revealed that participants in the empirical study were originally enrolled on different courses at their respective institutions and questions {{in the context of}} the empirical simulation course needed further clarity. The participants were not particularly aware of “current course” in the context of a simulation course and the question vagueness contributed to delay in response time. Of the total answers to this question requesting “month” information, 50 % were incorrect. A similar response was noted to profile question “year <b>started</b> <b>current</b> course” with a mean completion time of 16.18 seconds. The detailed exploration of answers revealed a 28 % “incorrect year” or unrealistic answers. The increased completion time can be attributed to the relevance and clarity issues reported above with respect to “current course”.|$|R
