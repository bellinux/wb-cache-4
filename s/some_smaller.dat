50|$|Before 1870, {{the area}} which later became Clydebank was largely rural, and agricultural. It {{consisted}} of some villages (Hardgate, Faifley, Duntocher, Dalmuir, Old Kilpatrick), farms and estates, with <b>some</b> <b>small</b> scale mining operations (coal, limestone and whinstone), several cotton mills and <b>some</b> <b>small</b> boatbuilding yards.|$|R

5|$|The {{historic}} centre is characterised by many baroque palaces. The Grassalkovich Palace, built around 1760, {{is now the}} residence of the Slovak president, and the Slovak government now has its seat in the former Archiepiscopal Palace. In 1805, diplomats of emperors Napoleon and Francis II signed the fourth Peace of Pressburg in the Primate's Palace, after Napoleon's victory in the Battle of Austerlitz. <b>Some</b> <b>smaller</b> houses are historically significant; composer Johann Nepomuk Hummel was born in an 18th-century house in the Old Town.|$|E
5|$|After engagements at Pultusk and Toruń in 1703 Augustus {{was finally}} forced to abdicate the Polish throne in 1704, {{in favor of}} a monarch {{installed}} by the Swedes, Stanisław I Leszczyński. Charles and Leszczyński were supported by the Warsaw Confederation of Polish nobles. In opposition to these developments the Sandomierz Confederation was created by other nobles in support of Augustus. The latter could call on about 75% of the military capacity of the Polish army. <b>Some</b> <b>smaller</b> engagements at Poznań, Lwów, Warsaw and Poniec followed in 1704 as a consequence of Augustus' attempts to retake the throne.|$|E

5|$|Although earlier {{theories}} {{postulated that}} large lakes formed from glacial meltwater, increased precipitation or decreased evaporation (or both) are today considered necessary for lake formation; a complete glacial melting {{would have had}} to occur in less than about a century to produce the required volume. The water volume would be insufficient to explain Lake Tauca's high water levels; however, <b>some</b> <b>smaller</b> lakes in the southern Altiplano probably expanded from glacial meltwater alone. The lake may have contributed to increased precipitation by influencing land breezes. According to strontium isotope data, there may have been little water exchange between Tauca's Uyuni and Coipasa basins. During the Coipasa lake cycle, the Coipasa-Uyuni and Poopó basins had a limited connection. Minor water-level fluctuations occurred during the lake's existence.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologist William R. Coe {{divided the}} Mundo Perdido complex into two clearly demarcated areas that he {{referred}} to as the High Plaza and the Low Plaza. The High Plaza is the area around the Lost World Pyramid. It is closed on the south side by Structures 6C-24 and 6C-25. A range of eight adjoining structures divide the High Plaza from the Plaza of the Seven Temples to the east. On the north side, the Plaza is principally delimited by Structures 5D-77, 5C-45, 5C-46, together with <b>some</b> <b>smaller</b> structures. The Low Plaza lies {{to the west of the}} Lost World Pyramid, centred upon Structure 5C-53, a low platform. The Low Plaza is closed on its north side by the Talud-Tablero Temple (5C-49), which is the second largest structure in the whole complex.|$|E
5|$|Boron carbide's {{structure}} is only approximately B4C, {{and it shows}} a clear depletion of carbon from this suggested stoichiometric ratio. This is due to its very complex structure. The substance can be seen with empirical formula B12C3 (i.e., with B12 dodecahedra being a motif), but with less carbon, as the suggested C3 units are replaced with C-B-C chains, and <b>some</b> <b>smaller</b> (B6) octahedra are present as well (see the boron carbide article for structural analysis). The repeating polymer plus semi-crystalline structure of boron carbide gives it great structural strength per weight. It is used in tank armor, bulletproof vests, and numerous other structural applications.|$|E

5|$|Firefighters were {{confident}} that the remaining fires could be extinguished during the dayTuesday 13 December. The smoke plume had been considerably reduced and was more grey, indicating the amount of vapourised water now combining with the smoke. It was reported at 16:45 that all tank fires had been extinguished, although <b>some</b> <b>smaller</b> fires persisted. 75% of firefighters for Hertfordshire were involved in fighting the fire, supported by 16other brigades. The entire gold command operation, involving many agencies {{as well as all}} the emergency services, was run from Hertfordshire Constabulary's headquarters in Welwyn Garden City, some distance from the fire.|$|E
5|$|Humiliated by the revolt, naval {{officers}} {{and the president of}} Brazil were staunchly opposed to amnesty, so they quickly began planning to assault the rebel ships. The former believed such an action was necessary to restore the service's honor. Late on the 24th, the President ordered the naval officers to attack the mutineers. Officers crewed <b>some</b> <b>smaller</b> warships and the cruiser , Bahias sister ship with ten 4.7-inch guns. They planned to attack {{on the morning of the}} 25th, when the government expected the mutineers would return to Guanabara Bay. When they did not return and the amnesty measure neared passage in the Chamber of Deputies, the order was rescinded. After the bill passed 125–23 and the president signed it into law, the mutineers stood down on the 26th.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the larger}} lemur species consume leaves (folivory), {{particularly}} the indriids. However, <b>some</b> <b>smaller</b> lemurs such as sportive lemurs (genus Lepilemur) and woolly lemurs (genus Avahi) also primarily eat leaves, making them the smallest primates that do so. The smallest of the lemurs generally do not eat much leaf matter. Collectively, lemurs have been documented consuming leaves from at least 82 native plant families and 15 alien plant families. Lemurs tend to be selective in their consumption of {{the part of the}} leaf or shoot as well as its age. Often, young leaves are preferred over mature leaves.|$|E

5|$|Much of the Merced River basin is at high elevation, {{where an}} alpine climate prevails. The Sierra {{receives}} heavy snowfall in the winter, which melts {{in the spring}} and early summer causing annual flooding. By late autumn the river level has dropped considerably, and <b>some</b> <b>smaller</b> tributaries dry up altogether. Up to 85% of the flow above Happy Isles comes from melting snow. In the dry season, groundwater provides the only base flow to the river. In addition, the river is fed by dozens of high Sierra lakes, the largest of which include Merced Lake, Tenaya Lake, Ostrander Lake, the Chain Lakes, and May Lake. The foothills experience a drier Mediterranean climate, while the San Joaquin Valley floor is dry enough to be considered semi-desert.|$|E
5|$|Oslo Package 3 is a {{political}} agreement between all the major projects on what to spend public funding for transport in Oslo and Akershus on. The agreement was made in 2007, and consists of 53 billion Norwegian krone (NOK), which will be shared between investments in road infrastructure, public transport infrastructure, and operating subsidies for Ruter. Financing comes from the state, the counties and from toll roads. The agreement states the major investments which are planned during a 20-year period. In addition, the previous agreement, Oslo Package 2, still has funding for <b>some</b> <b>smaller</b> projects.|$|E
5|$|The German {{forces in}} the area of the {{landings}} were under the command of Army Group G, and also divided between the 1st Army in the west and the 19th Army in the east. In June 1944, these three headquarters commanded three panzer divisions, around thirteen infantry divisions and <b>some</b> <b>smaller</b> formations. By this stage of the war, many of these divisions were lacking modern equipment, inexperienced and under-trained. The troops were mainly elderly, or not fit for service in a first class division. Some divisions had several complete battalions formed by the Ostlegionen (conscripted foreigners from Poland and Russia). Four of the divisions were static or garrison divisions and five were reserve formations that had only been used in an internal security role against the French Resistance.|$|E

5|$|The {{buildings}} are often purpose-built {{on a site}} where around 30-40m2 of playing space is available for each child in the playground. Around 6 m2 per child is allocated indoors. The institutions are intended to be mixed sex. Playschools are intended for {{children under the age}} of six; the youngest children to attend are at least two years old. Children of single parents and students are given priority, and in some cases children with a handicap are also given priority. In the majority of cases, the children are divided into age groups, but in <b>some</b> <b>smaller</b> communities these may be grouped together.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosaurids walked {{exclusively}} on their hindlimbs, so their leg bones were massive. In {{contrast to the}} forelimbs, the hindlimbs were longer compared to body size {{than almost any other}} theropods. Juveniles and even <b>some</b> <b>smaller</b> adults, like more basal tyrannosauroids, had longer tibiae than femora, a characteristic of fast-running dinosaurs like ornithomimids. Larger adults had leg proportions characteristic of slower-moving animals, but not to the extent seen in other large theropods like abelisaurids or carnosaurs. The third metatarsals of tyrannosaurids were pinched between the second and fourth metatarsals, forming a structure known as the arctometatarsus.|$|E
