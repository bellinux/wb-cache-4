5|$|Apart from Newfoundland and Labrador, each {{province}} and territory bears {{at least some}} elements from its coat of arms upon its flag. The flags of British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island are banners of the provincial arms, while Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, Saskatchewan, the Northwest Territories, and the Yukon each have the <b>shield</b> <b>of</b> the local coat of arms on their flags, with other design elements. The flag of Nunavut uses some elements from its coat of arms along with other symbols and colours. The <b>shield</b> <b>of</b> the arms of each province, on a blue background and circled with ten gold maple leaves, the whole surmounted by a crown, forms the main element of {{the flag of the}} Lieutenant-Governor of that province. The exceptions are Nova Scotia, which uses the Union Flag defaced with the <b>shield</b> <b>of</b> Nova Scotia, surrounded by green maple leaves, and Quebec, which uses the shield on a white circle with the provincial motto inscribed below.|$|E
5|$|The Abbey Shield was {{designed}} by Pierre de Chaignon la Rose of Harvard University. It incorporates the personal coat of Saint Anselm of Canterbury and the first seal {{of the state of}} New Hampshire. In 1927, by a monastic vote, the shield design was incorporated as the official <b>shield</b> <b>of</b> Saint Anselm Abbey and the college. The drops in each quadrant represent the three drops of blood on Anselm's coat of arms, and the sheaf of five arrows is taken from the first <b>shield</b> <b>of</b> the State of New Hampshire, representing the five original counties of the state. Hence, the Abbey Shield has been interpreted as Saint Anselm of New Hampshire.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{calculation}} <b>of</b> currents in <b>shields</b> <b>of</b> single-core cables at double-sided grounding of three-phase cable lines. We consider flat and trefoil cable lines and receive the analytical expressions for RMS currents in the <b>shields</b> <b>of</b> cables. These expressions allow reducing the shield current calculation error to value of 5 %. We analyze the known approximate expressions for RMS currents in the <b>shields</b> <b>of</b> cables and represent dependencies of corresponding calculation errors on cable line dimensionless parameters. These dimensionless parameters {{are determined by the}} distance between the axes of the cables, the radius and the resistance <b>of</b> <b>shields...</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1858, Alice and {{the three}} younger of her sisters were granted use of the royal arms, with an inescutcheon of the <b>shield</b> <b>of</b> Saxony, {{representing}} her father. The shield is differenced by a label argent of three points, demonstrating {{that she is the}} child of a monarch; the outer points bore an ermine spot each, and the centre bore a rose gules, to differentiate her from other members of the royal family.|$|E
5|$|In 1858, Beatrice and {{the three}} younger of her sisters were granted use of the royal arms, with an inescutcheon of the <b>shield</b> <b>of</b> Saxony and differenced by a label of three points argent. On Beatrice's arms, the outer points bore roses gules, and the centre a heart gules. In 1917, the inescutcheon was dropped by royal warrant from George V.|$|E

5|$|Phidias, who {{had been}} in charge of all {{building}} projects, was first accused of embezzling gold meant for the statue of Athena and then of impiety, because, when he wrought the battle of the Amazons on the <b>shield</b> <b>of</b> Athena, he carved out a figure that suggested himself as a bald old man, and also inserted a very fine likeness of Pericles fighting with an Amazon.|$|E
5|$|Saint Michael the Archangel appears {{often in}} heraldic settings. In one case, the device from the <b>shield</b> <b>of</b> the Trinity {{is placed on}} a blue field and {{attributed}} to St. Michael (Dennys, 95). More usually, he is shown in armour with a red cross on a white shield, slaying the devil depicted as a dragon. These attributed arms were later transferred to Saint George (Dennys, 109).|$|E
5|$|The mantles for the prelate and {{chancellor}} {{are dark}} blue {{like those of}} the members (as a member, the chancellor wears a member's mantle), but the mantles for the other officers are dark red.

For Garter ceremonies, Garter Principal King of Arms wears this red mantle rather than the tabard of the royal arms worn for other State ceremonial occasions.|$|E

5|$|The {{national}} emblem {{that was used}} {{at the time of}} the BNR and post-Soviet independence was called the Pahonia (the chase). On the base of a red shield, an armored white knight is mounted on a silver horse, with a sword drawn and charging to the left. On the <b>shield</b> <b>of</b> the knight, a golden Patriarchal cross is displayed. A variant of the Pahonia is used as the coat of arms of Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|Without the cost-sharing subsidies, the {{government}} estimated that premiums would increase by 20 percent to 30 percent for silver plans.

5|$|Albion's first regular shirt badge {{appeared}} in the late 1960s and early 1970s where it was blue. Although it featured the throstle, it {{did not include the}} blue and white striped <b>shield</b> <b>of</b> the club badge. A similar design was also used during the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the mid-1970s, a more abstract version of the throstle was used on the club's shirts, while in the late 1970s through to the mid-1980s, an embroidered WBA logo was displayed, a common abbreviation of the club's name in print. Not until the early 21st century did the full club badge appear on the team's shirts.|$|E

Marth leads his army to an ancient temple where Gharnef holds the ceremony. After killing Gharnef, retrieving Falchion, and rescuing the clerics, Marth confronts Medeus, who has taken {{the form of an}} enormous dark dragon. Using the Falchion and <b>Shield</b> <b>of</b> Seals, Marth slays Medeus. With peace restored to the land, Marth and Caeda, now married, become the rulers of all Archanea.|$|E

This state highway also passes very near Columbia State Historic Park, a protected area encompassing the historic business district of the town of Columbia; the park has preserved many Gold Rush-era buildings, which are presently occupied by tourist-oriented businesses.|$|E
5|$|In {{the western}} churches, the mitre was placed above the <b>shield</b> <b>of</b> all persons who were {{entitled}} to wear the mitre, including abbots. It substituted for the helmet of military arms, but also appeared as a crest placed atop a helmet, as was common in German heraldry. In the Anglican Churches, the mitre is still placed above the arms of bishops and not an ecclesiastical hat. In the Roman Catholic Church, {{the use of the}} mitre above the shield on the personal arms of clergy was suppressed in 1969, and is now found only on some corporate arms, like those of dioceses. Previously, the mitre was often included under the hat, and even in the arms of a cardinal, the mitre was not entirely displaced.|$|E
