40|$|The {{trend of}} retail {{concentration}} across the European Union has raised concerns on the buyer power that retailers {{may have in}} the relation with their suppliers. Specifically, due to the alleged increasing pressure on producer and supplier margins in various distribution chains, but the increased focus on consumer welfare in EU competition policy, various stakeholders call for demands {{for a change in}} the current <b>substantive</b> <b>legal</b> <b>framework</b> of EU competition law. In this discussion, reference is often made to initiatives at the national level that are specifically designed to deal with disparities in market power in business-to-business relations, such as prohibitions on so-called ‘abuse of economic dependency’ or ‘abuse of superior bargaining position’. This Law and Economics research addresses the underlying premise for these requests and therefore analyses whether there is a ‘gap’ in the current <b>substantive</b> <b>legal</b> <b>framework</b> of EU competition law, which may cause the underenforcement of the potential harmful effects of buyer power. That is, by applying the conceptual apparatus of economics to the field of EU competition law, it has been assessed from an economic efficiency perspective whether the competition rules provide for a legal basis to address the potential competition concerns of buyer power. The results show that the EU competition rules are readily applicable to buyer conduct and moreover provide for a legal basis to address the potential competition concerns of buyer power. The analysis therefore does not indicate that that the current <b>substantive</b> <b>legal</b> <b>framework</b> of EU competition law is unfit to address the potential harmful effects of buyer power. However, a critical comment is in place with regard to the application of the consumer welfare standard that appears to be used in EU competition policy. While the consumer welfare standard will generally not lead to very different decisions than its alternative, the total welfare standard, and may moreover be preferable due to mitigate regulation costs and undesirable lobbying, it has a specific disadvantage in the context of buyer power. Since buyer power may under specific circumstances harm economic efficiency but does not necessarily directly affect consumer welfare, application of the consumer welfare standard might lead to underenforcement of anti-competitive buyer conduct. There are, however, various indications that the European Commission is aware of this risk and may moreover refrain from the application of the consumer welfare standard in specific buyer power cases. Because this suggests that there is a discrepancy between the actual treatment of buyer conduct and the approach outlined in the European Commission’s guidelines, it seems advisable that these guidelines are clarified...|$|E
40|$|Competition and the State {{analyzes}} {{the role of}} the state across a number of dimensions as it relates to competition law and policy across a number of dimensions. This book re-conceptualizes the interaction between competition law and government activities in light of the profound transformation of the conception of state action in recent years by looking to the challenges of privatization, new public management, and public-private partnerships. It then asks whether there is a <b>substantive</b> <b>legal</b> <b>framework</b> that might be put in place to address competition issues as they relate to {{the role of the}} state. Various chapters also provide case studies of national experiences. The volume also examines one of the most highly controversial policy issues within the competition and regulatory sphere—the role of competition law and policy in the financial sector. This book, the third in the Global Competition Law and Economics series, provides a number of viewpoints of what competition law and policy mean both in theory and practice in a development context...|$|E
40|$|Kenya {{has had a}} <b>substantive</b> <b>legal</b> <b>framework</b> for asset-backed {{securities}} (ABS) since 2007 but is yet to see its first ABS issuance to date. The Capital Markets Act, Chapter 485 A, Laws of Kenya, {{as well as the}} Capital Markets (Asset-backed Securities) Regulations, 2007 have been decried as being inadequate; but without significant study into the legal and regulatory inequities thereof. ABS are securities that entitle investors to a return principally based on the cash-flows attributable to underlying securitised receivables. Such receivables may include mortgages, car and student loans, which when amassed may pose liquidity challenges to their originators. Thus an efficient ABS market would provide diverse wider financing options for originators and possibly ease access to credit. This dissertation then seeks to investigate the failings of Kenya?s regulatory landscape on ABS, with a focus on the intricacies of the true sale of the receivables, choice and structuring of special-purpose vehicles (SPVs), bankruptcy-remoteness of SPVs, taxation obligations and other legal and policy perspectives. The review is compared against the lessons gleaned in Africa?s largest securitisation market, South Africa, while recognising the difference in legal systems with Kenya. The United Kingdom is an additional comparator due to the common law similarities as well as the development of its capital markets. The dissertation identifies key conflicts and ambiguities in Kenya?s ABS framework, as well as critiquing current attempts at remedying them. Summarily, it provides an unexplored view into the potential workings of ABS as a source of finance in Kenya. Mini Dissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2017.

40|$|The {{involvement}} {{of children to}} fight in armed conflicts {{remains one of the}} main challenges towards the full realization of children's rights on the African continent. Despite a <b>substantive</b> <b>legal</b> <b>framework</b> affording protection and prohibiting the enlisting and recruitment of child soldiers, this practice remains prevalent in many parts of Africa particularly in the Great Lakes Region. As a result of their childhood and the traumatic events they are exposed to during armed conflicts, children inexorably suffer from many forms of harm including physical, mental and psychological harm. Addressing this harm as a matter of urgency is crucial for the proper and effective reintegration of these children into society. The Rome Statute departs from the silence of many international criminal law instruments which focus exclusively on the prosecution and sentencing of criminals overlooking the needs of the victims of international crimes by offering redress. It introduces a new and unique reparative system that aims at providing redress to the victims of international crimes within the courts' jurisdiction. This reparative regime which is still in its early life stages faces many challenges and uncertainties. In its first case dealing with principles relating to reparations, the International Criminal Court (ICC) showed these challenges and the difficulty of establishing permanent guidelines on future reparations to former child soldiers who are victims of the international crime(s) of the enlisting and recruitment to fight as combatants. Clear principles can help current and future victims by having an insightful and realistic expectation of the modalities and the scope of the reparation award they can get from the ICC...|$|E
40|$|The harmful {{traditional}} {{practice of}} child marriage {{remains one of the}} main challenges towards the full realization and enjoyment of children's rights in Africa. In the sub-Saharan Africa alone, countries such as Malawi are faced with the problem of child marriage where as high as 40 % of the women are married as children. Malawi has a <b>substantive</b> <b>legal</b> <b>framework</b> that affords protection and prohibits the harmful practice of child marriage. However, child marriages remain prevalent in Malawi where harmonisation of the laws is problematic. This has the effect of robbing the girl child of her childhood, access education and health among other rights that she is entitled. Addressing this problem in Malawi as a matter of urgency is crucial for the promotion, protection and realisation of children's rights, especially to the girl child. This study therefore conducts an analysis of the legal framework and contextual practice of child marriage in Malawi based on desk research of various laws in Malawi and literature. This analysis is premised on the understanding that human rights law within a legal framework plays a major role towards ensuring that young girls are protected from child marriage and its attendant consequences. This study has found that the laws of Malawi are not synchronised with each other especially with the Malawi Constitution with regard to protecting the rights. The case in point for instance is the recent passing of the Marriage, Divorce and Family Relations Act which reflects international and regional human rights standards, but is inconsistent with the Constitution of Malawi. It is recommended that Malawi should through the law address the practice of child marriage by amending the Constitution to remove any ambiguities. In this regard, creating a protective legal framework must not be done in vain. This should be supported by effective implementation of national development plans that aim to realise the rights of children, especially the girl child...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{reflects on}} the debt management problem in Zimbabwe. Like any other country Zimbabwe has a Constitutional <b>legal</b> <b>framework</b> that touches on debt management. The major issue at hand is why Zimbabwe is failing to sustain its external debt stock whilst it has a Constitutional <b>legal</b> <b>framework</b> that focuses on debt management. The study hypothesized that inadequacy of the Constitutional <b>legal</b> <b>frameworks</b> has led to unsustainable debt. The research utilized purposive and snowball sampling in selecting the key respondents. Data was gathered through document study, questionnaires and interviews. Questionnaires were administered to key respondents {{and in some cases}} interviews were concurrently held. Though the Constitutional <b>legal</b> <b>frameworks</b> provide for the institutional set up to undertake debt management and provide for the legality of loan contraction, the research revealed that the Constitutional <b>legal</b> <b>frameworks</b> are inadequate in other matters relating to debt management. Research findings demonstrated that the Constitutional <b>legal</b> <b>frameworks</b> do not specify the loan contraction process, void on external borrowing ceiling and does not clearly provide for the circumstances under which borrowing is permissible and makes loan contraction exclusive.
