40|$|Activities in the {{standardisation}} {{of medical}} ultrasonic imaging and monitoring devices have been undertaken {{to ensure the}} safe application and to provide the user with tools to perform risk-to-benefit analysis. Internationally, agreement has not been reached to implement a system based on a physical quantity such as temperature rise. Therefore, recently, the IEC Standard 60601 - 2 - 37 has adopted the thermal index (TI) as a <b>safety</b> <b>parameter.</b> TI indicates conditions that {{are more likely than}} others to produce thermal effects. The models used to calculate TI are based on the equilibrium temperature rise for a stationary transducer. Ultrasound (US) is often applied during a short time at one place. To characterise the situation before equilibrium is reached, this study proposes a new parameter: TT (time to threshold). TT indicates the time after which a threshold temperature rise is exceeded. TT is calculated for some tissue models to illustrate the meaning of TT. TT indicates how long one piece of tissue can be insonated safely, provided the safe threshold is known. Using TT, higher intensities can be applied safely during a limited time. This paper illustrates the effects of short insonation times and the influence of the beam diameter. Questions that are critical to the introduction of TT as a <b>safety</b> <b>parameter</b> are discussed. (C) 2003 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine Biology...|$|E

40|$|The {{integration}} of the <b>safety</b> <b>parameter</b> into process design and optimization is essential. However, there is no previous work in integrating the fire and explosion index (F&EI) into design and optimization. This research proposed a procedure for integrating safety into the design and optimization framework by using the <b>safety</b> <b>parameter</b> as optimization constraint. The method used in this research is Dow??????s Fire and Explosion Index which is usually calculated manually. This research automates the calculation of F&EI. The ability to calculate the F&EI, to determine loss control credit factors and business interruption, and to perform process unit risk analysis are unique features of this F&EI program. In addition to F&EI calculation, the F&EI program provides descriptions of each item of the penalties, chemicals/materials databases, the flexibility to submit known chemical/material data to databases, and material factor calculations. Moreover, the sensitivity analyses are automated by generating charts and expressions of F&EI {{as a function of}} material inventory and pressure. The expression will be the focal point in the process of integrating F&EI into process design and optimization framework. The proposed procedure of integrating F&EI into process design and optimization framework is verified by applying it into reactor-distillation column system. The final result is the optimum economic and inherently safer design for the reactor and distillation column system...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} use of a Kalman filter (KF) to predict, within the shutdown system (SDS) of a nuclear power plant (NPP), whether a <b>safety</b> <b>parameter</b> measurement will reach a corresponding trip set-point (TSP). The proposed predictive SDS (PSDS) designs aim to initiate shutdown actions at a time which is earlier than conventional shutdown initiation. These early detections are, in turn, expected to improve safety and productivity margins within the NPP. The KF-based point-PSDS design utilizes a linear time-varying (LTV) system model to predict mean <b>safety</b> <b>parameter</b> measurements for comparison against the TSP. The KF considers noise covariances that either have assumed predetermined values, or are estimated online using an adaptive limited memory filter (ALMF). The PSDS is enhanced to consider, by recursive least squares (RLS) estimation, conditions that are uncertain with respect to the assumed system model and noise properties. The result is a KF⁄RLS-based PSDS that compensates for prediction error by RLS-based estimation of deterministic disturbances to the system state and measurement. The PSDS is further enhanced to calculate confidence intervals for the predictions {{as a function of the}} propagated error covariance. This enhancement results in interval-PSDS designs that consider confidence in an impending condition by comparing predetermined confidence interval bounds against the TSP. Finally, an optimal-PSDS design is formulated to adapt the effective prediction, e. g. horizon or bias, by limiting and minimizing the probability of missed and false trip occurrences respectively using hypothesis testing methods and optimal alarm theory. In this manner, the optimal-PSDS is made aware of the quality of past predictions. The PSDS designs are compared, through simulation and experiment, against a conventional SDS in terms of response time or time-to-trip for the steam generator level low (SGLL) <b>safety</b> <b>parameter</b> under various conditions of uncertainty, e. g. parameter error or unmeasurable signals. MATLAB-based simulations demonstrate that the PSDS designs are able to reduce time-to-trip. The PSDS designs are then implemented within a Tricon v 9 safety-PLC with a scan time that adheres to current nuclear industry regulations. The experimental results reveal that a reduced time-to-trip can be achieved for a real-world system with unknown system-model mismatch...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Reactor safety {{analyses}} often utilize a deterministic approach {{where in}} addition to performing best estimate calculations, uncertainty is accommodated by performing calculations with pessimistic values for input parameters {{that are important to}} safety. Here a stochastic approach is considered for explicitly including uncertainty in <b>safety</b> <b>parameters</b> by applying Monte Carlo sampling coupled with established deterministic reactor safety analysis tools. The Monte Carlo approach yields frequency distributions for reactor safety metrics (e. g., peak temperatures) that can be compared to performance limits, allowing for an improved determination of the safety margin and a clear determination of which <b>safety</b> <b>parameters</b> are most important to the transient response. Because the approach provides for the estimation of probabilities for violating safety boundaries it should be useful in a risk based regulatory environment. It has the advantage of not requiring any substantial rewriting of existing safety analyis computer codes. 1...|$|R
