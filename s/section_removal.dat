40|$|This work {{presents}} the radiation performance of open-ended circular-waveguide probe antennas {{that have been}} miniaturized {{by the introduction of}} thin metamaterial liners. The liners introduce an HE$_{ 11 }$ mode well below the natural cutoff frequency, which provides substantial gain improvements over a similarly sized waveguide probe. A new feeding arrangement employing a shielded-loop source embedded inside the miniaturized waveguide is developed to efficiently excite the HE$_{ 11 }$ mode and avoid the excitation of other modes across the frequency reduced band while maintaining the antenna's compactness. A metamaterial-lined circular-waveguide probe antenna operating over 42 % below its natural cutoff frequency is designed to provide a radiation efficiency of up to 28. 8 %. A simple, printed-circuit implementation of the metamaterial liner based on inductively loaded wires is proposed and its dispersion features are discussed. Comment: The manuscript has been revised for publication as a 6 page communication in the IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation. This included a reduction of material in the theory <b>section,</b> <b>removal</b> of all discussion on anisotropic theory, and introduction of a novel excitation sourc...|$|E
40|$|Truncations of the subunit of {{ribulose}} bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) from Rhodospirillum rubrum {{were generated}} by site-directed mutagenesis {{to examine the}} role of the C-terminal tail <b>section.</b> <b>Removal</b> of the last and the penultimate alpha-helices in the tail section changes the quaternary structure of the protein. Electrophoretic and electron microscope analysis revealed that the truncated subunits assemble into an octamer, whereas the wild-type enzyme has a dimeric structure. The octomerization of the mutant protein is due to a hydrophobic patch exposed to the solvent by truncation of the subunit. The mutant protein thus consists of four dimers, bound end-to-end by hydrophobic interactions. Insertion of a polar amino acid in the hydrophobic patch by a L 424 to N 424 substitution restores the familiar dimeric structure. Truncation of the subunit is associated with a considerable decrease in catalytic activity. The mutants undergo carbamylation but bind the reaction intermediate analog, 2 -carboxy arabinitol- 1, 5 -bisphosphate, poorly. This indicates that loss of activity in the mutant is due to weakened substrate binding. These findings suggest that the mutations in the tail section of the subunit are transmitted to the active site, although the C-terminal region is far from the active site. On the basis of the crystal structure of Rubisco, we propose a model for how the truncations of the enzyme subunit induce conformational changes in one of the two phosphate binding sites...|$|E

Endomicroscopes achieve optical <b>sectioning</b> (<b>removal</b> of the background intensity) using the confocal principle - each image frame is assembled in a point-by-point fashion by scanning a laser spot rapidly over the tissue. In table-top confocal microscopes the scanning is usually performed using bulky galvanometer or resonant scanning mirrors. Endomicroscopes either have a miniaturised scanning head at the distal tip of the imaging probe, or perform the scanning outside of the patient and use an imaging fibre bundle to transfer the scan pattern to the tissue.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{two methods}} for staining resinless thin sections with antibodies and gold-conjugated second antibodies. Immunolocalization of specific proteins {{is a powerful}} tool for cell structure studies but current techniques do not develop its full potential. Immunofluorescence provides only low-resolution localization, whereas conventional thin-section electron microscopy images and immunostains only the section surface. Resinless sections of extracted cell structures offer a simple and effective means of immuno-electron microscopy. Without embedding plastic or soluble proteins, the cell cytostructure produces high-contrast, three-dimensional images. Resinless sections of detergent-extracted cells are prepared by embedding in diethylene glycol distearate, sectioning, and removing diethylene glycol distearate before microscopy. In the first method of immunostaining, extracted cells were fixed and stained with antibodies before embedment, <b>sectioning,</b> <b>removal</b> of the embedding resin, and critical point drying. In the postembedment method, the sample was embedded and sectioned, the diethylene glycol distearate was removed, and the sample was rehydrated before antibody staining. With these techniques, specific proteins were localized with high resolution throughout the entire section. Stereoscopic micrographs of resinless sections revealed the precise localization of specific cytoskeleton and nuclear matrix proteins in three dimensions with unprecedented clarity...|$|R

40|$|Background: Rural {{surgical}} {{practice is}} {{the practice of}} Surgery under conditions of limited resources which brings surgical services to the doorsteps of the rural Populace, majority of whom are poor. Aims: The aim {{of this paper is}} to highlight rural surgical practice in Nigeria. Materials and Methods: A review of personal experiences in rural surgery and interaction with other practitioners in the field as well information gathered at Rural Surgery conferences in Nigeria and abroad. Results: Scope of surgery performed is commonly usually limited by infrastructure, manpower and funding. Procedures include fields as Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Urology, Orthopaedics, Ear Nose and throat, Anaesthesia as well as General Surgery. A high proportion is contributed by emergencies especially Caesarian <b>Sections,</b> <b>removal</b> of foreign bodies from the ear, nose and throat, initial management of simple fractures, Hip-pinning, appendectomies, relief of intestinal obstruction, suprapubiccystostomies, catheterization and management of ruptured ectopic tubal pregnancies. The procedures are carried out by General Duty doctors with only a few surgeons in established self-owned practices. Challenges include poor living conditions, poor accessibility, lack of infrastructure and equipment, lack of suitably trained assistants, inadequate schools for their children, lack of suitable jobs for spouses. In spite of difficulties Rural Surgery in Nigeria has come to stay and is growing especially with formation of Rural Surgical Practitioners in Nigeria. Conclusion: Rural surgical practice is feasible in Nigeria and should be encouraged by the Government as it forms an important arm of Healthcare delivery in Nigeria...|$|R
30|$|The ‘safer’ {{approach}} to handle inconsistencies is to ignore these aggregation sessions and not perform any aggregation {{that may result}} in inaccurate aggregates. However, not only the aggregates can be influenced in this case. Recall {{from the beginning of}} this <b>section</b> that <b>removal</b> of a membership from a counting bloom filter that is actually not present introduces false negatives (Deke et al. 2010). Therefore, the following aggregation sessions are prone to inaccuracies as the assumption of no false negatives does not hold anymore. By skipping inconsistent aggregation sessions, DIAS makes sure that the condition of no false negatives in counting bloom filters is not violated.|$|R
40|$|This is a {{completely}} reformulated presentation of a previous paper with the same title; {{this time with a}} much stronger emphasis on conceptual aspects of string theory and a detailed review of its already more than four decades lasting history within a broader context, including some little-known details. Although there have been several books and essays on the sociological impact and its philosophical implications, there is yet no serious attempt to scrutinize its claims about particle physics using the powerful conceptual arsenal of contemporary local quantum physics. I decided to leave the previous first version on the arXiv because it may be interesting to the reader to notice the change of viewpoint and the reason behind it. Other reasons for preventing my first version to go into print and to rewrite {{it in such a way}} that its content complies with my different actual viewpoint can be found at the end of the article. The central message, contained in sections 5 and 6, is that string theory is not what string theorists think and claim it is. The widespread acceptance of a theory whose interpretation has been obtained by metaphoric reasoning had a corroding influence on the rest of particle physics theory as will be illustrated in several concrete cases.
