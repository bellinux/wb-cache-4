5|$|Oxygen {{presents}} two spectrophotometric {{absorption bands}} peaking at the wavelengths 687 and 760nm. Some remote sensing scientists have proposed using {{the measurement of}} the radiance coming from vegetation canopies in those bands to characterize plant health status from a <b>satellite</b> <b>platform.</b> This approach exploits {{the fact that in}} those bands it is possible to discriminate the vegetation's reflectance from its fluorescence, which is much weaker. The measurement is technically difficult owing to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the physical structure of vegetation; but it has been proposed as a possible method of monitoring the carbon cycle from satellites on a global scale.|$|E
