5|$|Originally {{consisting}} of twenty chapters– one {{was cut in}} later editions– Theory of Literature describes various aspects of literary theory, criticism, and history.

5|$|Real-time {{holography}} is {{a second}} method of creating holographic interferograms. A holograph of the unstressed object is created.

Social pragmatic theories <b>stress</b> <b>the</b> role of the caregiver in talking about objects, actions, or events that the infant is already focused-in upon.|$|E
