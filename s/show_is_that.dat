5|$|Joseph's {{role in the}} <b>show</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{of troubled}} surgeon – the {{resultant}} angst of his brother's attempted suicide and his own anally retentive personality lead to the revelation the character suffers from Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). His major storylines included an accidental drugs overdose, and a relationship with fellow surgical registrar Jac Naylor, who cheated on him with his own father. Roberts' performance resulted in a longlist nomination for the Most Popular Newcomer award at the 2006 National Television Awards.|$|E
5|$|Anton Meyer is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the BBC medical drama Holby City, played by actor George Irving. He {{appeared in the}} series from its first episode, broadcast on 12 January 1999, until series four, episode 46, broadcast on 20 August 2002. His role in the <b>show</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of consultant cardiothoracic surgeon {{and head of the}} cardiothoracic surgery department at Holby General. Irving had considerable input in creating the character, who was initially envisioned by the series producers as an Iranian surgeon named Hussein. At Irving's suggestion, Meyer became Hungarian, an emigrant to Britain following the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. Little of the backstory created for Meyer was ever revealed on-screen, as part of a deliberate bid to present the character as enigmatic, allowing viewers to project their own imagination onto him.|$|E
25|$|Chemical Bait Study: A census {{study in}} Costa Rica {{including}} E. imperialis, shows that males {{of this species}} are attracted primarily to cineole, followed by methyl salicylate and methyl cinnamate. What this study was able to <b>show,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there is some degree representative of seasonal fluctuation of pollinators, which is slightly more intense in deciduous forest habitats than in rain forest habitats. However, when there is strong inter-habitat heterogeneity, such as is with the ability of euglossine bees to pollinate flowering orchid plants, a low percentage of pollen-laden bees could result.|$|E

25|$|The show's visual {{style is}} that of digital ink-and-paint. The style was chosen both for the retro feel it gives the show and for the {{versatility}} and freedom it allows the animators, providing {{an environment in which}} it is possible to combine many different styles of animation. Another unique aspect of the <b>show</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> where most cartoons present their characters, though animated, as real within the show's world, the Drawn Together characters retain their identities as cartoon characters even within their animated world, and acknowledge their status as animations. The show has cameo appearances by famous characters (or in some cases, copyright-avoiding clones) from all across the animated spectrum.|$|E
25|$|Another {{criticism}} of the <b>show</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the actors' impressions, though passable on their radio show, were not at all convincing once they went to TV broadcasts. This problem got worse as the cast got older. The impressions were also often made fun of for being nothing more than thin caricatures {{of one or more}} of the politician or celebrity's characteristics (i.e. Roger Abbott's portrayal of Jean Chrétien as a twisted-mouthed man who ridiculously mispronounced English words with an over the top French Canadian accent, Jessica Holmes' impressions of Celine Dion as a diva and a whiny Liza Minnelli, and Craig Lauzon's impression of Stephen Harper as a robot).|$|E
25|$|Himani Singh {{is played}} by Gurdeep Punj. She is Avatar's wife {{and the mother of}} Rohan, Dolly, Sunny, Nikki, and Bobby. She works as a {{hospital}} nurse and is often portrayed as dutiful, protective, and comedic. She loves her family and does everything to care for and protect them. She appears out of her element when she isn't nurturing them, especially Nikki, but as the series progresses, she begins to feel assured that her youngest children are in good hands and trusts that her husband and three elder children can look after Nikki and Bobby. She is notoriously conceited and enjoys bragging about her accomplishments, be they admirable, real, or otherwise. Himani used to work on the local news team and was also a poet in her high-school days. A running gag on the <b>show</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> she was involved in virtually every extracurricular activity at Arya College of Arts and Science, but still earned a nursing degree. She lets special opportunities go to her head, such as being on TV or singing in front of a group. She has a habit of taking any chance at publicity that may shine on her family to focus on her, but this never works out well; usually she ends up being cut from the project or tossed out of certain groups. Himani seldom accepts her children's misbehavior. It is revealed in the third special that she is pregnant again with her fifth child. In the middle of the third season, Himani quit her nursing job to be a stay-at-home mother to Nikki and Bobby. Himani is the equivalent of Amy Duncan in Good Luck Charlie, who {{is played by}} Leigh-Allyn Baker.|$|E

500|$|Gough and Miller were so {{passionate about}} the pilot that they wanted it {{released}} in some form so the fans could see it. Gough said in an interview, [...] "The implication when a network doesn't pick up a <b>show</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the pilot sucks and that's not the case. It's not a perfect pilot {{by any stretch of}} the imagination. There are other reasons—which are a mystery to us—as to why The CW didn't pick it up."

500|$|The {{theme of}} father-figures {{is one that}} is {{explored}} throughout The X-Files, in relation to both Mulder and Scully. As well as their own fathers, a number of characters play a paternal role to the agents in later episodes, including Deep Throat, the Cigarette-Smoking Man and Senator Matheson. Both of the protagonists have deep-rooted family issues and this episode {{is the beginning of the}} exploration of that story arc. A motif often employed in the <b>show</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of mirroring, doubling or cloning. Scully's relationship with her father, first dealt with in [...] "Beyond the Sea", is mirrored by that of Mulder's with his father—also named William—who dies at the end of the second season.|$|E
500|$|A {{highlight}} {{derived from}} Ephron's book {{and that was}} consistently praised was the O'Donnell portrayal {{of the role of}} the purse in the scene [...] "I Hate My Purse!". While Reiner says, [...] "There's an amusing 'I hate my purse' segment", Isherwood notes [...] "The smartest and shapeliest piece of writing in the <b>show</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> acerbic essay by Nora Ephron about her troublesome relationship with purses...Entrusted to Ms. O'Donnell, who does it proud, the essay is a defiant denunciation of the tyranny of the pocketbook, a 'j'accuse' for the era of the 'it' bag." [...] Shaw described O'Donnell's purse performance as an aria, and Jerry Tallmer of The Villager called it [...] "one of the pillars of the show". This scene is sometimes performed alone outside of the theatre.|$|E

500|$|Madeleine [...] "Maddy" [...] Young is {{a fictional}} {{character}} in the BBC medical drama Holby City, portrayed by actress Nadine Lewington. The character first appeared on-screen on 16 January 2007, in episode [...] "Face Value" [...] - series 9, episode 15 of the programme. Her final appearance in the show was in the Series 11 episode [...] "Just A Perfect Day" [...] when her character was fatally stabbed. [...] Her role in the <b>show</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of a Senior House Officer undergoing her general surgical rotation in Holby's acute admissions unit. Described by the BBC as [...] "enthusiastic [...] fun" [...] and [...] "dedicated to her job", Maddy was created alongside fellow new character General Surgical Consultant Dan Clifford. Her major storylines have centered on their friendship and relationship, {{as well as her}} troubled family background and her continual rule-breaking.|$|E
500|$|Bryant L. Griffin of Airlock Alpha {{compared}} Olivia to {{the character}} Sydney Bristow from the television series Alias, and opined that Fringe [...] "continues to exhibit a satisfying stride." [...] Griffin however was disappointed that events from the previous episode were ignored, believing {{it to be a}} mistake to continue emphasising formulaic storytelling rather than a serialized format. Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times felt that despite the extra ten minutes, [...] "Bound" [...] was [...] "more like a two-hour episode... being crammed into half the time". He thought the episode's four writers were [...] "all busy", as there were three stories going on at once, and compared Olivia to the similarly characterized Lost character Jack Shephard. Hanson concluded, [...] "But how bad can it be when my biggest complaint about a <b>show</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I want more? And now that the cold winter of reruns has passed, we should be getting just that." ...|$|E
500|$|The Office {{was filmed}} with a single-camera setup in a cinéma vérité {{allowing}} {{the look of}} an actual documentary, with no studio audience or laugh track, allowing its [...] "deadpan" [...] and [...] "absurd" [...] humor to fully come across. [...] The primary vehicle for the <b>show</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a camera crew has decided to film Dunder Mifflin and its employees, seemingly around the clock. The presence of the camera is acknowledged by the characters, especially Michael Scott, who enthusiastically participates in the filming. The characters, especially Jim and Pam, also look towards the camera when Michael creates an awkward situation. The main action {{of the show is}} supplemented with talking-head interviews or [...] "confessionals" [...] in which characters speak one on one with the camera crew about the day's events. Actor John Krasinski shot the footage of Scranton for the opening credits after he found out he was cast as Jim. He visited Scranton for research and interviewed employees at actual paper companies.|$|E

500|$|In April 2016, Most Wanted {{was seen}} to be [...] "a no-brainer" [...] for a series pick-up by {{industry}} insiders. However, in early May it {{was said to be}} [...] "cooling" [...] and [...] "not considered the lock it once was". At that time, the producers were prepping [...] "if-come" [...] orders, [...] "deals with writers that will come into effect in the event a pilot is picked [...] to series". On May 12, 2016, the pilot was passed on by ABC, with Lee's successor Channing Dungey explaining that Most Wanted [...] "did not feel as strong as some of the other pilots that we shot. We talked about it with Marvel and we all came to an agreement that we want {{to figure out what the}} next <b>show</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we do together, is something that we all feel is as creatively strong as it can be." [...] However, Dungey said that ABC was open to the series being shopped to another network if Marvel found [...] "another home" [...] for it. Loeb also acknowledged this possibility, but said that the series was designed [...] "to do a very specific thing" [...] alongside S.H.I.E.L.D. on ABC.|$|E
500|$|Assessing The Sword of Shannara {{three decades}} after its publication, Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey {{wrote that the}} novel was {{distinctive}} for [...] "the dogged {{way in which it}} follow Tolkien point for point". Within Brooks' novel, Shippey located [...] "analogues" [...] for Tolkien characters such as Sauron (Brona), Gandalf (Allanon), the Hobbits (Shea and Flick), Aragorn (Menion), Boromir (Balinor), Gimli (Hendel), Legolas (Durin and Dayel), Gollum (Orl Fane), the Barrow-wight (Mist Wraith), the Nazgûl (Skull Bearers), and Tom Bombadil (King of the Silver River), among others. He also found plot similarities to events in The Lord of the Rings such as the Fellowship of the Ring's formation and adventures, the journeys to Rivendell (Culhaven) and Lothlórien (Storlock), Gandalf's (Allanon) fall in Moria (Paranor) and subsequent reappearance, and the Rohirrim's arrival at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields (Battle of Tyrsis), among others. Avoiding direct commentary on the book's quality, Shippey attributed the book's success to the post-Tolkienian advent of the fantasy genre: [...] "What The Sword of Shannara seems to <b>show</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> many readers had developed the taste ... for heroic fantasy so strongly that if they could not get the real thing they would take any substitute, no matter how diluted." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{repercussions of}} the {{euthanasia}} for Dot's character {{have been described}} as [...] "extremely serious" [...] as she suffered from [...] "untold guilt and felt that she needed to be punished for the action." [...] The Executive Producer overseeing this storyline, John Yorke, has discussed the storyline in a speech given at the Bishops' Conference for clergy and other ministers in the Diocese of St Albans: [...] "Dot, as a good Christian, refused to help, until her love for her friend overcame her own fear of damnation. Riddled with an intolerable burden of guilt, she felt there was only one person she could talk to [...] The Dot and Ethel storyline played out in over four months with many similar scenes, to an average audience of 16 million viewers. Dot [...] explored the full panoply of religious belief before coming back to terms with her maker. When Alan Bookbinder took over as head of religious broadcasting at the BBC he described EastEnders for the weeks the Dot and Ethel story ran as 'the best religious programme on television' and compared [...] to Graham Greene. While we felt a little uncomfortable in such exalted company, what it did <b>show</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> handled properly an audience is able to engage in, and relate to profound ethical debate." ...|$|E

[...] Staff members of Pitchfork ranked the song on their list of The Top 100 Tracks of 2006 at number eighty-five. The song was nominated for Best Female R Vocal Performance at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards (2007) but lost to Mary J. Blige's song [...] "Be Without You" [...] (2005). Jody Rosen from The New Yorker credited [...] the jarring timbral and tonal variations on the song for giving a new musical sound that didn't exist in the world before Knowles. He further wrote, [...] "If they sound 'normal' now, it's because Beyoncé, and her many followers, have retrained our ears."

500|$|The seventh-season {{premiere of}} the series, which aired on May 20, 2012 in its earlier timeslot, {{continued}} to deliver high ratings attracting almost three million total viewers which exceeded the {{premiere of the}} previous season by 16%. Kim Kardashian has explained {{the success of the}} show by saying that people tune in to watch the series because they can relate themselves {{to the members of the}} family; in an interview with the V magazine she said: [...] "You can see that soap operas aren't on the air as much anymore. I think reality shows are taking over that genre, but I think the draw to our <b>show</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we are relatable." [...] The eighth season debuted to 3 million viewers, up 6% from the previous season, while the subsequent ninth season's premiere was down by 20%. The ninth season averaged 3.3 million total viewers and almost 2.2 million in the 1849 years adult demographic, the most sought after by advertisers. It was the highest rated cable show in its timeslot. The series finished as the most-social ad-supported cable program and, as of March 2015, Keeping Up with the Kardashians is the most-watched show on E! network. The first episode of the tenth season averaged 2.5 million viewers, slightly less than the premiere of the ninth season. In 2016, a New York Times study of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook Likes found that Keeping Up with the Kardashians [...] "tends to most popular in areas with large Hispanic populations, particularly in the Southwest".|$|E
500|$|Kudos {{began to}} develop the show after {{producing}} the Channel 4 medical drama series Psychos in 1999. Kudos wished to explore series ideas that saw beyond typical [...] "precinct-based dramas" [...] (crime and medical). Stephen Garrett decided on developing a spy drama after coming across John le Carré novels at a Waterstone's bookstore, and came to realise that MI5 or MI6 had not been featured as the setting for shows before. He felt {{the benefit of a}} spy <b>show</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> rather than in a crime drama where the protagonists take their work home with them, spies are given the added dimension that they cannot reveal their work even to their loved ones. In the meantime, Wolstencroft, who wrote Psychos, was also developing a spy drama, albeit as a film. When Kudos contacted him, they agreed they should work together to create a television series based on his idea, which was not to glamourise the world of spies, instead showing the audience that spies work in a [...] "shitty job". Kudos later pitched the show to all the major British television networks; however none of them were as enthusiastic as Kudos, as they did not see the potential of a post-Cold War spy series. After the commissioning teams from the networks were replaced, Kudos again pitched the show, albeit reinvented, and as a result Lorraine Heggessey, controller of BBC One, commissioned the show after planning to introduce [...] "braver", [...] "dynamic" [...] and [...] "pacier" [...] shows to attract a younger audience for the channel.|$|E
