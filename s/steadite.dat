40|$|The {{corrosion}} {{of engine}} {{components of the}} combustion chamber is usually related {{to the formation of}} acids such as sulfuric and nitric. These acids are generated by the condensation of combustion gases that usually occur in vehicle exhaust systems. However, with the development of new technologies to reduce emissions, condensation is also being promoted in vehicle combustion chambers. This fact is associated with high exhaust gas recirculation rates, known as EGR (English term for Exhaust Gas Recirculation). Consequently, corrosion problems in the engine components are increasing, especially in cylinder liners alloy manufactured using cast iron. In this study, the corrosion resistance of two cast iron alloys, one with a pearlitic microstructure and the other with a bainite microstructure in a solution simulating the composition of the condensate obtained from the combustion gases. It was found that the microstructure of the cast iron is an important factor affecting the corrosion behavior. The results showed that none of the two materials investigated is resistant to corrosion in the test medium, and the small difference observed between the behavior of the two cast iron was related to its microstructure, which are dependent on their chemical compositions. The cast iron with a pearlitic microstructure showed less formation of corrosion products than the bainitic cast iron. This result is related to the presence of <b>steadite</b> phase, highly stable and resistant to corrosion in pearlitic microstructure. This phase (<b>steadite)</b> anchors the corrosion products formed on the surface and act as a partial barrier slowing the progress of the corrosion process, that was more pronounced in the bainitic cast iron...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} wear resistance investigations of locomotive engine parts on the comparison of different techniques for surface treatment were undertaken and compared {{with respect to their}} best fit for purpose. Base of the development was to improve the resistance of cylinder liners against abrasive wear in the region of the upper dead centre as well as of piston ring grooves against wear and deformation. Techniques compared are laser transformation hardening and laser-assisted alloying. During surface characterisation and wear tests alloyed surfaces have shown a better integrity of the surface and slightly smaller abrasion. The break out of <b>Steadite</b> grains observed in the hardened surfaces will increase the capacity of lubricant storage and improve failsafe running functions. This effect makes transformation hardening the preferred technique for cylinder liner treatment for the piston ring grooves careful analysis has proven the equivalence of the techniques. For reasons of simplicity in production also transformation hardening will be preferred. However, the balance will turn according to the field tests of the components which are currently under appraisal...|$|E
