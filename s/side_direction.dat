50|$|Route {{panorama}} is {{a continuous}} 2D image that includes all the scenes visible from a route, as it {{first appeared in}} Zheng and Tsuji′s work of panoramic views in 1990. Different from a local panorama at a static viewpoint, a digital route panorama is constructed from partial views at consecutive viewpoints along a path. A general approach to obtain such a complete route panorama {{is to use a}} line camera or slit camera mounted on a vehicle moving along the path smoothly. The camera scans temporal scenes in the <b>side</b> <b>direction</b> of the path and connect them to the spatial image. This is realized by a program that processes temporal image data or video data in a computer. The route panorama can extend to a long distance for indexing scenes and navigation on the Internet. The long image can further be transmitted to and be scrolled on computer screens or handheld devices as moving panorama for access of geospatial locations, navigation, georeferencing, etc.|$|E

There are smaller and larger model-cars supported by onboard computer, camera and some additional instrumentation. The {{building of the}} Husar-rover types is focusing on the basic planetary surface activities by moving vehicle. The rover has a solar panel on its board placed on a model-car chassis. In the Husar-b version the drive is on the back wheels by electric engines, movements are controlled by the camera view through a wireless connection to the computer. It {{can be used for}} roving among rocks and observing their surfaces. On a larger chassis Husar-2a version there are independent driving on all the four wheels. This fact allows directing a special movement. The rover can turn in a very narrow arc which is important to approach objects in <b>side</b> <b>direction.</b> The wheels in one axis are connected by a differential. The structural framework, the driving mechanism all have a left- and right-hand side symmetric structure. The movements are directed through servo engines, which were originally designed for analogous direction, however, even 8 of these servos can be directed by a microcontroller. This microcontroller gets the position of the servos through RS 232 port of the computer. The camera of Husar-2 transmits images with 30 frame/sec, and it has wireless connection with the computer (1200 MHz).|$|E

Mainly, it is formed by rather long reverberation and frequency-depending reflections effected by the columns. Measurements in more than 50 German Gothic churches show a narrow range for mid-frequency reverberation depending on volume being typical for this architectural style but differing for churches with plaster or brick surfaces. The dimensions of the columns lead to the effect that the first high-frequency reflections (coming from <b>side</b> <b>directions)</b> reach the listeners earlier than the low-frequency reflections (coming from above).

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{to apply}} tuned mass dampers (TMDs) ({{one in the}} fore–aft direction, one in the side– <b>side</b> <b>direction)</b> to suppress the vibration of a monopile wind turbine tower. Using the spectral element method, we derive a finite-dimensional state-space model d from an infinite-dimensional model d of a monopile wind turbine tower stabilised by a TMD located in the nacelle. and d {{can be used to}} represent the dynamics of the tower and TMD in either the fore–aft direction or the side– <b>side</b> <b>direction.</b> The wind turbine tower subsystem of is modelled as a non-uniform SCOLE (NASA Spacecraft Control Laboratory Experiment) system consisting of an Euler–Bernoulli beam equation describing the dynamics of the flexible tower and the Newton–Euler rigid body equations describing the dynamics of the heavy rotor-nacelle assembly (RNA) by neglecting any coupling with blade motions. d can be used for fast and accurate simulation for the dynamics of the wind turbine tower as well as for optimal TMD designs. We show that d agrees very well with the FAST (fatigue, aerodynamics, structures and turbulence) simulation of the NREL 5 -MW wind turbine model. We optimise the parameters of the TMD by minimising the frequency-limited H 2 -norm of the transfer function matrix of d which has input of force and torque acting on the RNA, and output of tower-top displacement. The performances of the optimal TMDs in the fore–aft and side–side directions are tested through FAST simulations, which achieve substantial fatigue load reductions. This research also demonstrates how to optimally tune TMDs to reduce vibrations of flexible structures described by partial differential equations...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn {{investigation}} {{was conducted on}} the overall burst-instability of isolated coal pillars by means of the possibility index diagnosis method (PIDM). First, the abutment pressure calculation model of the gob in <b>side</b> <b>direction</b> was established to derive the abutment pressure distribution curve of the isolated coal pillar. Second, the overall burst-instability ratio of the isolated coal pillars was defined. Finally, the PIDM was utilized to judge the possibility of overall burst-instability and recoverability of isolated coal pillars. The results show that an overall burst-instability may occur due to a large gob width or a small pillar width. If the width of the isolated coal pillar is not large enough, the shallow coal seam will be damaged at first, and then the high abutment pressure will be transferred to the deep coal seam, which may cause an overall burst-instability accident. This approach can be adopted to design widths of gobs and isolated coal pillars and to evaluate whether an existing isolated coal pillar is recoverable in skip-mining mines...|$|E
