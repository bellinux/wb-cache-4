5|$|Potbelly sculptures are {{generally}} rough sculptures that show considerable variation {{in size and}} {{the position of the}} limbs. They depict obese human figures, usually <b>sat</b> <b>cross-legged</b> with their arms upon their stomach. They have puffed out or hanging cheeks, closed eyes and are of indeterminate gender.|$|E
2500|$|The walled {{enclosure}} {{was found}} to contain {{the remains of a}} man, a woman, and a child, along with numerous grave goods. [...] The man was aged about 30 when he died, the woman about 70 (a considerable age for the period), and the child—of unknown sex—was aged 10 or 11. There is evidence that the man had rowed a boat when he was younger, and that the woman had habitually <b>sat</b> <b>cross-legged</b> and possibly had spun flax.|$|E
2500|$|In {{all matters}} of holding and playing it is {{recommended}} that the player use only the muscles needed for any musical task and to relax as much as possible, using only as much force as is necessary. This will allow one to play longer, easier and to put the effort into creativity rather than mechanics. [...] In the past many players <b>sat</b> <b>cross-legged</b> on a rug, but now most perform sitting, often using a classical guitarist's footrest under the right foot to help hold the barbat.|$|E
60|$|He <b>sat</b> down <b>cross-legged</b> on the platform, {{with his}} sailor hat tipped {{back on his}} head, and the Wizard blew a {{beautiful}} bubble all around him.|$|R
50|$|A {{particular}} narration detailed how Samudra, while tortured in a cauldron full {{of boiling}} water, human blood, bone marrow and excrement, caused {{the contents of}} the cauldron to cool down and then <b>sat</b> meditating <b>cross-legged</b> on a lotus sprouting from the fluid.|$|R
6000|$|He {{came and}} <b>sat</b> himself <b>cross-legged</b> on the floor, before the lower drawer of the cabinet, which grandma opened for him, saying, with a benign stroke of the curly head, [...] "There, dear, that 's where I keep the little {{memorials}} {{of my brother}} Jack. Poor lad, he was lost at sea, you know. Well, choose anything you like, and I 'll try to remember a story about it." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{his book}} Yingyai Shenglan, Ma Huan also {{describes}} the Majapahit cities: {{most of them}} do not have walls surrounding the city or the suburbs. He describes the king's palace in Majapahit. The king’s residence is surrounded with thick red brick walls more than three chang high (about [...] ), with length of more than 200 paces (...) and on the wall there are two layers of gates, the palace is very well guarded and clean. The king's palace was a two-storey building, each of them 3 or 4 chang high (...) [...] It had wooden plank floors and exposed mats made from rattan or reeds (presumably palm leaves), where people <b>sat</b> <b>cross-legged.</b> The roof was made of hardwood shingles (Javanese:sirap) laid as tiles.|$|E
6000|$|... "Heskiwin, 'e's a good un too, hain't 'e, Bobo?" [...] asked Lancey, {{pointing}} {{with his}} thumb to the tall Turk, who <b>sat</b> <b>cross-legged</b> beside him smoking a chibouk.|$|E
60|$|As these {{thoughts}} passed {{through his mind}} he entered the tent where Mohammed Beyd <b>sat</b> <b>cross-legged</b> upon a rug, smoking. The Arab looked up as the European came into his presence.|$|E
60|$|He <b>sat</b> down <b>cross-legged</b> on {{the floor}} among his papers, strung them {{together}} with a bodkin {{and a piece of}} string--revised them, wrote all the titles and honours by which he was personally distinguished {{at the head of the}} first page, and then read the manuscript to me with loud theatrical emphasis and profuse theatrical gesticulation. The reader will have an opportunity, ere long, of forming his own opinion of the document. It will be sufficient to mention here that it answered my purpose.|$|R
6000|$|I saw the {{marriage}} of the trapper {{in the open air}} in the far west, [...] the bride was a red girl, [...] Her father and his friends <b>sat</b> near <b>cross-legged</b> and dumbly smoking, [...] they had moccasins to their feet and large thick blankets [...] hanging from their shoulders, [...] On a bank lounged the trapper, he was drest mostly in skins, his luxuriant [...] beard and curls protected his neck, he held his bride by the hand, [...] She had long eyelashes, her head was bare, her coarse straight locks [...] descended upon her voluptuous limbs and reach'd to her feet.|$|R
60|$|Presently they <b>sat</b> down, <b>cross-legged,</b> one on {{each side}} of the tarpaulin, and began the meal. That was the strangest supper Joan ever sat down to; it was like a dream where there was danger that {{tortured}} her; but she knew she was dreaming and would soon wake up. Kells was almost imperceptibly changing. The amiability of his face seemed to have stiffened. The only time he addressed her was when he offered to help her to more meat or bread or coffee. After the meal was finished he would not let her wash the pans and pots, and attended to that himself.|$|R
60|$|Presently {{there came}} {{the call to}} supper, which had been laid upon a new {{tarpaulin}} spread on the ground. The men flopped down, and <b>sat</b> <b>cross-legged,</b> each with silent or vociferous appreciation of that generous repast.|$|E
60|$|I {{returned}} with the box {{and placed it on}} the divan near her. She <b>sat</b> <b>cross-legged,</b> leaning back on her arms, in the blue shimmer of her embroidered robe and with the tawny halo of her unruly hair about her face which she raised to mine with an air of resignation.|$|E
60|$|Hurree Babu {{returned}} to his note-book, balanced on the window-sill, but his hand shook. Huneefa, {{in some sort of}} drugged ecstasy, wrenched herself to and fro as she <b>sat</b> <b>cross-legged</b> by Kim's still head, and called upon devil after devil, in the ancient order of the ritual, binding them to avoid the boy's every action.|$|E
60|$|I did {{not attempt}} to follow her, other than to see that she reached the {{building}} in safety, but, directing Woola to accompany her, I turned disconsolately and entered my own house. I <b>sat</b> for hours <b>cross-legged,</b> and cross-tempered, upon my silks meditating upon the queer freaks chance plays upon us poor devils of mortals.|$|R
60|$|One day {{the lawn}} had been mown, and the {{children}} where all very busy wheeling their little barrows, and loading them with the short grass; David was with them at first, but when Purday left off work, he marched after {{the old man in}} his grave deliberate way, and was seen no more till nearly tea-time, when he walked into the school-room with a very set look upon his solemn face, and <b>sat</b> himself down <b>cross-legged</b> on the locker, with a sigh that seemed {{to come out of the}} very depths of his heart.|$|R
60|$|Little Toomai {{attended}} to Kala Nag's supper, and as evening fell, {{wandered through the}} camp, unspeakably happy, {{in search of a}} tom-tom. When an Indian child's heart is full, he does not run about and make a noise in an irregular fashion. He sits down to a sort of revel all by himself. And Little Toomai had been spoken to by Petersen Sahib! If he had not found what he wanted, I believe he would have been ill. But the sweetmeat seller in the camp lent him a little tom-tom--a drum beaten with the flat of the hand--and he <b>sat</b> down, <b>cross-legged,</b> before Kala Nag as the stars began to come out, the tom-tom in his lap, and he thumped and he thumped and he thumped, and the more he thought of the great honor that had been done to him, the more he thumped, all alone among the elephant fodder. There was no tune and no words, but the thumping made him happy.|$|R
60|$|She had won. She was profusely {{escorted to}} a room like a grandmother's attic, where she {{discovered}} periodicals devoted to house-decoration and town-planning, with a six-year file of the National Geographic. Miss Villets blessedly left her alone. Humming, fluttering pages with delighted fingers, Carol <b>sat</b> <b>cross-legged</b> on the floor, the magazines in heaps about her.|$|E
60|$|The yellow plain {{had only}} {{appeared}} to be level. Roy led down into a shallow ravine, where a tiny stream meandered, and he followed this around to the left, coming at length {{to a point where}} cedars and dwarf pines formed a little grove. Here, as the others rode up, he <b>sat</b> <b>cross-legged</b> in his saddle, and waited.|$|E
60|$|A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I {{slipped in}} there. It {{contained}} a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care {{that it should}} be one stored with pictures. I mounted into the window- seat: gathering up my feet, I <b>sat</b> <b>cross-legged,</b> like a Turk; and, having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double retirement.|$|E
60|$|I had a syce or groom {{who passed}} {{by the name of}} Lal Biro. This man was a tall, reserved, white-haired old Hindoo, a Jat by caste, but with a figure which might have been taken for that of a Brahman. His manner to me was always cold and {{sometimes}} sullen; and I found it difficult to place myself on the same terms with him as with my other servants. One dark evening, however, during the cold season, I had driven back from Cawnpore with him late at night in a small open trap, and found him far more chatty and communicative than usual. When we reached the bungalow, we discovered that the lights were out, and the house almost shut up, as the servants had fancied that I meant to sleep at the club. Lal Biro accordingly came in with me, and helped me to get my supper ready. Then at my request he <b>sat</b> down <b>cross-legged</b> near the door and continued to give me some reminiscences of the Mutiny which had been interrupted by our arrival.|$|R
60|$|It {{was on the}} gun-deck {{that our}} dinners were spread; all along between the guns; and there, as we <b>cross-legged</b> <b>sat,</b> {{you would have thought}} a hundred farm-yards and meadows were nigh. Such a cackling of ducks, chickens, and ganders; such a lowing of oxen, and bleating of lambkins, penned up here and there along the deck, to provide sea repasts for the officers. More rural than naval were the sounds; {{continually}} reminding each mother's son of the old paternal homestead in the green old clime; the old arching elms; the hill where we gambolled; and down by the barley banks of the stream where we bathed.|$|R
60|$|The English men {{used to wear}} a long {{dress like}} a carter's frock, and their legs were wound round with strips of cloth by way of stockings. Their houses were only one story, and had no chimneys--only a hole at the top for the smoke to go out at; and no glass in the windows. The only glass there was at all had been brought from Italy to put into York Cathedral, and it was thought a great wonder. So the windows had {{shutters}} {{to keep out the}} rain and wind, and the fire {{was in the middle of}} the room. At dinner-time, about twelve o'clock, the lord and lady of the house <b>sat</b> upon <b>cross-legged</b> stools, and their children and servants sat on benches; and square bits of wood called trenchers, were put before them for plates, while the servants carried round the meat on spits, and everybody cut off a piece with his own knife and at it without a fork. They drank out of cows' horns, if they had not silver cups. But though they were so rough they were often good, brave people.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've got you covered," [...] {{said the}} young man, graciously, and Private Copper, hopping on one leg, {{because of his}} sprain, {{recovered}} the pipe yet another three yards downhill and squatted under another rock slightly larger than the first. A roundish boulder made a pleasant rest for his captor, who <b>sat</b> <b>cross-legged</b> once more, facing Copper, his rifle across his knee, {{his hand on the}} trigger-guard.|$|E
60|$|These hunters had a poor outfit, excepting, of course, their horses. They {{were young}} men, rangy in build, lean and hard from {{life in the}} saddle, bronzed like Indians, still-faced, and keen-eyed. Two of them {{appeared}} to be tired out, and lagged at the camp-fire duties. When the meager meal was prepared they <b>sat,</b> <b>cross-legged,</b> before a ragged tarpaulin, eating and drinking in silence.|$|E
60|$|Very soon--he said--he saw the {{two white}} men walking amongst the fires. They waved their arms and talked together, {{stopping}} from time to time; they approached Daman; and the short man with the hair on his face addressed him earnestly and at great length. Daman <b>sat</b> <b>cross-legged</b> upon a little carpet with an open Koran {{on his knees and}} chanted the versets swaying to and fro with his eyes shut.|$|E
500|$|The opening musical {{introduction}} of the song served as a brief twenty-six seconds musical interlude on the Drowned World Tour in 2001. As Madonna finished a performance of [...] "Frozen" [...] in the Geisha inspired segment of the show, she <b>sat</b> in a <b>cross-legged</b> position {{in front of the}} stage. The musical intro for [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] would start with a dancer in a Japanese costume dancing behind her on a raised podium. As the music ends, Madonna starts singing [...] "Nobody's Perfect" [...] from her 2000 album Music. In 2008, Madonna sang the first verse and chorus at two dates—Las Vegas and East Rutherford—of her Sticky & Sweet Tour. Madonna forgot the lyrics at the Vegas show and refused to sing the song in Boston; she performed [...] "Express Yourself" [...] instead.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{get it done}} in no time!" [...] cried Ethel, rushing headlong upstairs, twice {{tripping}} in {{it before}} she reached the attic, where she slept, as well as Flora and Mary--a large room in the roof, the windows gay with bird-cages and flowers, a canary singing loud enough to deafen any one but girls to whom headaches were unknown, plenty of books and treasures, and a very fine view, from the dormer window, of the town sloping downwards, and the river winding away, with some heathy hills in the distance. Poking and peering about with her short-sighted eyes, Ethel lighted on a work-basket in rare disorder, pulled off her frock, threw on a shawl, and <b>sat</b> down <b>cross-legged</b> on her bed, stitching vigorously, while meantime she spouted with great emphasis an ode of Horace, which Norman having learned by heart, she had followed his example; it being her great desire to be even with him in all his studies, and though eleven months younger, she had never yet fallen behind him. On Saturday, he showed her what were his tasks for the week, {{and as soon as}} her rent was repaired, she swung herself downstairs in search of him for this purpose. She found him in the drawing-room, a pretty, pleasant room--its only fault that it was rather too low. It had windows opening down to the lawn, and was full of pretty things, works and knick-knacks. Ethel found the state of affairs unfavourable to her. Norman was intent on a book on the sofa, and at the table sat Mr. Ernescliffe, hard at work with calculations and mathematical instruments. Ethel would not for the world that any one should guess at her classical studies--she scarcely liked to believe that even her father knew of them, and to mention them before Mr. Ernescliffe would have been dreadful. So she only shoved Norman, and asked him to come.|$|R
60|$|The cipaye led me forward {{accordingly}} to a {{place from}} which I had a clear view upon the house. It was surrounded with a wide verandah; a lamp, very well trimmed, stood upon the floor of it, and {{on either side of}} the lamp there <b>sat</b> a man, <b>cross-legged,</b> after the Oriental manner. Both, besides, were bundled up in muslin like two natives; and yet one of them was not only a white man, but a man very well known to me and the reader, being indeed that very Master of Ballantrae of whose gallantry and genius I have had to speak so often. Word had reached me that he was come to the Indies, though we had never met at least, and I heard little of his occupations. But, sure, I had no sooner recognised him, and found myself in the arms of so old a comrade, than I supposed my tribulations were quite done. I stepped plainly forth into the light of the moon, which shone exceeding strong, and hailing Ballantrae by name, made him in a few words master of my grievous situation. He turned, started the least thing in the world, looked me fair in the face while I was speaking, and when I had done addressed himself to his companion in the barbarous native dialect. The second person, who was of an extraordinary delicate appearance, with legs like walking canes and fingers like the stalk of a tobacco pipe, (6) now rose to his feet.|$|R
60|$|Slightly {{squaring}} {{his shoulders}} and opening his coat, to permit a rhetorical freedom, which did not, however, prevent him from keeping touch with {{the butt of his}} revolver, Chivers stepped into the open air. Collinson had been moved to the shelter of an overhang of the roof, probably more for the comfort of the guard, who <b>sat</b> <b>cross-legged</b> on the ground near him, than for his own. Dismissing the man with a gesture, Chivers straightened himself before his captive.|$|E
60|$|And Dick Graves, being {{a little}} drunk, very faithful, and very simple-minded, {{told her that he}} thought Jacob the {{greatest}} man he had ever known. And down they <b>sat</b> <b>cross-legged</b> upon cushions and talked about Jacob, and Helen's voice trembled, for they both seemed heroes to her, and the friendship between them so much more beautiful than women's friendships. Anthony Pollett now asked her to dance, and as she danced she looked at them, over her shoulder, standing at the table, drinking together.|$|E
60|$|But Barnaby delayed {{beyond all}} precedent. The visitor's dinner was served, removed, his wine was set, the fire replenished, the hearth clean swept; the light waned without, it grew dusk, became quite dark, and still no Barnaby appeared. Yet, though John Willet {{was full of}} wonder and misgiving, his guest <b>sat</b> <b>cross-legged</b> in the easy-chair, to all {{appearance}} as little ruffled in his thoughts as in his dress--the same calm, easy, cool gentleman, without a care or thought beyond his golden toothpick.|$|E
6000|$|And {{for a while}} I {{found little}} of {{interest}} in Granada but the Alhambra. The gipsy quarter, with neither beauty, colour, nor even a touch of barbarism, is a squalid, brutal place, consisting of little dens built in the rock of the mountain which stands opposite the Alhambra. Worse than hovels, they are the lairs of wild beasts, foetid and oppressive, inhabited by debased creatures, with the low forehead, the copper skin, and the shifty cruel look of the Spanish gipsy. They surround the visitor in their rags and tatters, clamouring for alms, and for exorbitant sums proposing to dance. Even in the slums of great cities I have not seen a life more bestial. I {{tried to imagine what}} sort of existence these people led. In the old days the rock-dwellings among the cactus served the gipsies for winter quarters only, and when the spring came they set off, scouring the country for something to earn or steal; but that is long ago. For two generations they have remained in these hovels--year in, year out--employed in shoeing horses, shearing, and the like menial occupations which the Spaniard thinks beneath his dignity. The women tell fortunes, or dance for the foreigner, or worse. It is a mere struggle for daily bread. I wondered whether in the spring-time the young men loved the maidens, or if they only coupled like the beasts. I saw one pair who seemed quite newly wed; for their scanty furniture was new and they were young. The man, short and squat, <b>sat</b> scowling, <b>cross-legged</b> on a chair, a cigarette between his lips. The woman was taller and not ill-made, a slattern; her hair fell dishevelled on her back and over her forehead; her dress was open, displaying the bosom; her apron was filthy. But when she smiled, asking for money, her teeth were white and regular, and her eyes flashed darkly. She was attractive in a heavy sensual fashion, attractive {{and at the same time}} horribly repellant: she was the sort of woman who might fetter a man to herself by some degrading, insuperable passion, the true Carmen of the famous story whom a man might at once love and hate; so that though she dragged him to hell in shame and in despair, he would never find the strength to free himself. But where among that bastard race was the splendid desire for freedom of their fathers, the love of the fresh air of heaven and the untrammeled life of the fields? ...|$|R
60|$|As Pierre, now hurrying {{from his}} chamber, was rapidly passing {{through one of}} the higher brick colonnades {{connecting}} the ancient building with the modern, there advanced toward him {{from the direction of the}} latter, a very plain, composed, manly figure, with a countenance rather pale if any thing, but quite clear and without wrinkle. Though the brow and the beard, and the steadiness of the head and settledness of the step indicated mature age, yet the blue, bright, but still quiescent eye offered a very striking contrast. In that eye, the gay immortal youth Apollo, seemed enshrined; while on that ivory-throned brow, old Saturn <b>cross-legged</b> <b>sat.</b> The whole countenance of this man, the whole air and look of this man, expressed a cheerful content. Cheerful is the adjective, for it was the contrary of gloom; content--perhaps acquiescence--is the substantive, for it was not Happiness or Delight. But while the personal look and air of this man were thus winning, there was still something latently visible in him which repelled. That something may best be characterized as non-Benevolence. Non-Benevolence seems the best word, for it was neither Malice nor Ill-will; but something passive. To crown all, a certain floating atmosphere seemed to invest and go along with this man. That atmosphere seems only renderable in words by the term Inscrutableness. Though the clothes worn by this man were strictly in accordance with the general style of any unobtrusive gentleman's dress, yet his clothes seemed to disguise this man. One would almost have said, his very face, the apparently natural glance of his very eye disguised this man.|$|R
60|$|Another most {{striking}} {{feature of the}} performance was exhibited by a score of old men, who <b>sat</b> <b>cross-legged</b> in the little pulpits, which encircled the trunks of the immense trees growing {{in the middle of}} the enclosure. These venerable gentlemen, who I presume were the priests, kept up an uninterrupted monotonous chant, which was nearly drowned in the roar of drums. In the right hand they held a finely-woven grass fan, with a heavy black wooden handle, curiously chased: these fans they kept in continual motion.|$|E
