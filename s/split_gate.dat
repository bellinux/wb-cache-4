The current prevalence of Majapahit style pendopo pavilion, candi bentar and paduraksa gates, was owed to the influence of Majapahit aesthetics on Javanese and Balinese architecture.|$|E

40|$|The {{properties}} of conductance in one-dimensional (1 D) quantum wires are statistically investigated using {{an array of}} 256 lithographically-identical <b>split</b> <b>gates,</b> fabricated on a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure. All the <b>split</b> <b>gates</b> are measured during a single cooldown under the same conditions. Electron many-body effects give rise to an anomalous feature in the conductance of a one-dimensional quantum wire, known as the ` 0. 7 structure' (or ` 0. 7 anomaly'). To handle the large data set, a method of automatically estimating the conductance value of the 0. 7 structure is developed. Large differences are observed in the strength and value of the 0. 7 structure [from 0. 63 to 0. 84 × (2 e^ 2 /h) ], despite the constant temperature and identical device design. Variations in the 1 D potential profile are quantified by estimating the curvature of the barrier {{in the direction of}} electron transport, following a saddle-point model. The 0. 7 structure appears to be highly sensitive to the specific confining potential within individual devices...|$|R

50|$|Traditional mosques in Java {{maintain}} a distinctive Javanese style. The pendopo model {{is used as}} main feature of the mosque as its prayer hall. A trapezoidal roof is used instead of the more typically Muslim dome. These roofs are often multi-tiered and tiled.

50|$|There are {{two types}} of gates within Balinese architecture: the <b>split</b> <b>gate,</b> known as candi bentar, and the roofed tower gate known as paduraksa or kori agung. Both types of gates have {{specific}} roles in Balinese architectural design. Candi bentar is the gate used in the nista mandala, while the kori agung is employed as the gate between the madya mandala and Utama mandala inner compounds. The rules for gate types are also valid for non-religious compounds such as puri, nobles' and kings' residences.|$|E

50|$|Unlike European architecture, Balinese {{houses and}} puri (palaces) are not {{created as a}} single huge building, but rather a {{collection}} of numerous structures within walled enclosure each with a special functions; such as front open pavilion to receive guests, main bedroom, other bedrooms, pelinggihan or pemrajan is a small family shrine, living areas and kitchen. Kitchen and living areas that helds everyday mundane activities are usually separated from family shrine. Most of these pavilions are created in Balinese balé architecture, a thatched roof structure with or without walls similar to Javanese pendopo. The walled enclosure are connected with series of gates. Balinese architecture recognize two types of gates, the candi bentar <b>split</b> <b>gate,</b> and paduraksa or kori roofed gates.|$|E
50|$|Other than {{narrowing}} the passage, candi bentar do not serve a real defensive purpose, since {{this type of}} <b>split</b> <b>gates</b> are originally designed not to have doors.

40|$|Supporting online {{material}} Materials and Methods Single-walled {{carbon nanotube}} (SWNT) devices are fabricated using standard photolithographic techniques (1). Molybdenum electrodes (50 nm thick) are deposited by {{electron beam evaporation}} onto a degenerately doped silicon substrate with 100 nm layer of silicon oxide. The Mo electrodes form the <b>split</b> <b>gates</b> above which an additional 100 nm Si oxide layer is deposited using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). Iron nano-particle catalyst sites are defined and NTs (with diameters of 1 - 4 nm) are grown by chemical vapor deposition at 700 - 1050 0 C. Finally, metallic electrodes (5 nm Cr, 50 nm Au) form the contacts for the NT device.
