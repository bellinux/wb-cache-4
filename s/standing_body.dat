500|$|Mother's Milk {{features}} {{a black and}} white photograph of the band sprawled across the arms of a proportionately larger naked woman. A rose conceals one of her nipples while Kiedis' <b>standing</b> <b>body</b> conceals the other. There were originally two women whose photographs were planned to be used, one being Kiedis' girlfriend Ione Skye and the other being model Dawn Alane; the latter was ultimately chosen. Controversy arose, however, when Dawn claimed the band did not notify her that she was the one chosen to be on the cover of Mother's Milk. Furthermore, several national chains refused to sell the record because they believed the female subject displayed too much nudity. A more strictly censored version was manufactured for some retailers that featured the band members in far larger proportion than the original. The cover of the record was influenced by a promotional poster Kiedis had from the 1960s of Sly and the Family Stone, in which frontman Sly Stone held a miniaturized band in his palm. When Kiedis was finding shots of the band to use on the cover, Frusciante initially refused every photograph the vocalist showed him but settled on one of him sitting down laughing. Mother's Milk was affixed with an [...] "explicit language" [...] warning sticker that, according to Kiedis, [...] "oesn't bother me. Our lyrics are very explicit, whether it's about sex or friendship or love for life in general." [...] The cover booklet of the record {{features a}} painting by Hillel Slovak. Following the album's release, a limited number of promotional posters were issued with the model's breasts exposed. Dawn had no knowledge of the pressing and sued the band, winning a $50,000 settlement.|$|E
2500|$|All great lords {{created an}} {{affinity}} {{between themselves and}} groups of supporters, travelling with them, for purposes of mutual benefit and defence, and Humphrey Stafford was no exception. These men were often his estate tenants, who could also be called upon when necessary for soldiering, {{as well as other}} duties. They were often retained by indenture. In the 1450s, for example, Stafford retained men specifically [...] "to sojourn and ride" [...] with him. His affinity was probably composed along the lines laid out by royal ordinance, viz up to, but not above, 240 men, including [...] "forty gentlemen, eighty yeomen and a variety of lesser individuals", although drawn in much smaller numbers in times of peace from the localities, rather than a <b>standing</b> <b>body</b> of men. In the late 1440s it was at least ten knights and twenty-seven esquires, mainly from Cheshire. Probably due to the political climate, this increased after 1457. His household has been estimated at around 150 people by about 1450. It has been estimated that maintaining both his affinity and household cost the duke over £900 a year.|$|E

40|$|Detailed {{mapping of}} the layered {{deposits}} in the Valles Marineris, Mars from high-resolution Viking orbiter images revealed that they from plateaus of rhythmically layered material whose bases {{are in the}} lowest elevations of the canyon floors, and whose tops are within a few hundred meters in elevation of the surrounding plateaus. Four hypotheses for {{the origin of the}} layered deposits were considered: that they are eolian deposits; that they are remnants of the same material as the canyon walls; that they are explosive volcanic deposits; or that they were deposited in <b>standing</b> <b>bodies</b> of water. There are serious morphologic objections to each of the first three. The deposition of the layered deposits in <b>standing</b> <b>bodies</b> of water best explains their lateral continuity, horizontality, great thickness, rhythmic nature, and stratigraphic relationships with other units within the canyons. The Martian climatic history indicated that any ancient lakes were ice covered. Two methods for transporting sediment through a cover of ice on a martian lake appear to be feasible. Based on the presently available data, along with the theoretical calculations presented, it appears most likely that the layered deposits in the Valles Marineris were laid down in <b>standing</b> <b>bodies</b> of water...|$|R
