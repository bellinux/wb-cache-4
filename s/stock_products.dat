2500|$|In October 2004, American fashion {{retailer}} Abercrombie & Fitch Co. {{responded to}} pressure from PETA to boycott Australian merino wool {{due in part to}} the use of mulesing in Australia. The National Farmers' Federation responded by stating [...] "Abercrombie and Fitch does not use Australian wool". Then, in December 2008, one of the world's largest retailers, Liz Claiborne, (in which PETA is a shareholder) banned the use of Australian Merino wool in its products in opposition to the mulesing practice, at the time an Australian Wool Innovations spokesman said [...] "the company did not purchase any Australian wool". In June 2009, British department store chain John Lewis joined the wool boycott. The international fashion retailer New Look also refuses to <b>stock</b> <b>products</b> made from Australian Merino wool. The campaign by PETA also seeks to draw attention to Australia's live sheep export trade. PETA's campaign has hurt the Australian wool industry with several American and European clothing retailers agreeing to the boycott.|$|E
