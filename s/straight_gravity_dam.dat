40|$|Theoretical {{investigations}} of the dynamic behavior of some important fluid-structure systems are conducted to seek a better understanding of: 1) the hydrodynamic pressures generated in the fluid {{as a result of}} both the rigid body and the vibrational motions of the structure, and 2) the effects of the fluid on the dynamic properties of the structure as well as on its response to earthquake ground motions. Explicit formulas are presented for the hydrodynamic pressures generated in fluid domains having boundaries which can be approximated by simple geometries. Such domains may be reservoirs behind dams, or around intake towers, water around bridge piers or liquids stored in circular cylindrical tanks. The formulas are used to calculate the hydrodynamic pressures analytically and the results are exhibited in a form showing the pressure dependence on the various parameters of the problem. The fluid-structure interaction problems of long straight walls, having uniform rectangular sections, and long <b>straight</b> <b>gravity</b> <b>dams,</b> having uniform triangular sections, are investigated. The natural frequencies of vibration and the associated mode shapes are found in the former case, through a fully analytical approach for both the structure and the fluid domains, and in the latter, by discretizing the dam into finite elements and treating the reservoir as a continuum by boundary solution techniques. A method is presented for computing the earthquake response of both structures, based on superposition of their free vibrational modes. The problems of limited length dam or wall-reservoir systems are investigated. The natural frequencies of the structure and the corresponding mode shapes are found by the Rayleigh-Ritz method. This method is also used to obtain the frequency domain response of the structure to all three components of the ground motion. The validity of the two dimensional approximation, often made in the analysis of <b>gravity</b> <b>dams,</b> and the effect of the length to height ratio on the dynamic properties and response of the structure are studied. Time domain responses to arbitrary earthquake ground notions are evaluated by superposing the frequency domain responses, to individual Fourier components of the excitation, through the Fourier Integral. For efficiency of computation, a fast Fourier analysis is used for both the forward transform of the ground excitation and the inverse transform of the Fourier Integral...|$|R

50|$|The {{barrier is}} a <b>straight</b> <b>gravity</b> <b>dam,</b> which holds the water back by its sheer weight. It {{was built in}} several {{sections}} and finished in 1959. It is 106 m high and 415 m long. In recent years (before 2002) {{the crest of the}} dam was renewed. The roadway and the concrete had weathered and could no longer handle the weight of traffic. The lake behind the dam acts primarily as a reserve drinking water reservoir for the towns east of the Harz. The pressure pipes go to Aschersleben, Halberstadt, Bernburg (Saale), Halle (Saale) and even Leipzig. Its water quality is particularly good; water hardness averages 3° on the German hardness scale. So the water is ideal for use for steam generation and washing. The reservoir also contributes to generation of hydro-electric power to a small extent.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} cost {{of construction}} of the dam was Indian Rupees 216.1 Lakhs (in the late 19th century). The catchment area of the reservoir is , and the depth is 14.63 m. The <b>dam</b> is a <b>straight</b> <b>gravity</b> type masonry <b>dam</b> 425.5 m long and 120.7 m high above the deepest foundation. There is no inspection gallery.The water from the reservoir is used for both irrigation of crops and for drinking purposes, {{which has led to}} conflict between farmers who want to use all the water for their crops, and local authorities, who don't have another place to draw drinking water from, for supply to the urban areas. The dam is surrounded by hills of the Western Ghats.|$|R
50|$|The runoff {{emerging}} from surrounding hills drains into this lake. The lake is pear-shaped and is encircled by the Aravalli hills {{on three sides}} with a <b>straight</b> <b>gravity</b> stone masonry <b>dam</b> {{on the eastern side}} which has a spillway to discharge flood flows during the monsoon season. Three causeways, one from Pichola Lake, the other from Madar Lake and the third one from Badi Lake lead to the Fateh Sagar Lake. There are three inlet channels, which feed the lake and an overflow section on the eastern side in the masonry dam of 800 m length. Monsoon rains are the main source of all water to the lake. Initially constructed as an irrigation scheme, it is now the second major source of drinking water to the city of Udaipur and the irrigation supplies have been discontinued. A canal from the Rang Sagar Lake connects to the Fateh Sagar Lake. A gate controlled canal further connects Fateh Sagar Lake with Lake Pichhola. The Northeastern embankment is known by three names viz., the Pal, the Drive, or Connaught Bund (bund means embankment).|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} make way for its construction, the {{inhabitants}} of the village of Muldenhammer (also called Windischhammer or Windischthal), whose former buildings (10 homes, 1 wood pulp factory, 1 large estate for the breeding of Höhenfleckrinder cattle and a paper mill) lie today under the water surface, had to be resettled. Many of them moved to new houses that were built in Eibenstock. In addition, the Chemnitz-Aue-Adorf railway between Wolfsgrün and Schönheide Ost was interrupted. The Schönheiderhammer tunnel on that stretch of the route was flooded. At low water levels the old portals of the tunnel can still be seen. Likewise, the branch line from Eibenstock unt. Bf. to Eibenstock ob. Bf. had to be closed. This section, the only standard gauge railway in Saxony with an incline of 1:20, was once known as the Eibenstock Ramp (Steilstrecke Eibenstock).The barrier itself is a <b>straight</b> <b>gravity</b> <b>dam</b> made of concrete.

The highest <b>straight</b> <b>gravity</b> <b>dam</b> in {{the world}} {{occupies}} the predominant position amongst the places of tourist interest. The idea {{for the construction of}} this dam was conceived by Sir Louis Dane the then Lieutenant Governor of Punjab, who travelled from Sunni to Bilaspur and then onward to Ropar. The project could not make headway due to prohibitive cost of construction. In the year 1938-39 the districts of Rohtak and Hissar of the then Punjab State experienced severe drought resulting in great loss of human life and cattle. The scheme was again mooted out but was not executed due to second world war. It was only after independence in March, 1948 that the work was taken in hand for execution. On the historic day of 17 November 1955 later Prime Minister Shri Jawahar Lal Nehru placed the first bucket of concrete at the foundation. The construction of dam was completed in October, 1962. The height of the dam is 226 metres, length at the top is 518 metres and width 9 metres. It has a length of 99 metres at the bottom and width 402 metres. The project derives its name from two villages Bhakhra and Nangal situated on the foot hills of the low Himalayan ranges. Bhakhra occupies a very important place on the India’s tourist map and has rightly been described as a [...] "New Temple of Resurgent India", by the late Prime Minister Mr. Nehru. The project authorities have set up a Public Relation Office in Nangal Township which provides necessary help and guidance to the tourists. edit ...|$|E
