What Dublin got from James Joyce—a sprawling, ambitious, loving, exasperated and playful chronicle of all its good and bad parts—Detroit has from native son Eugenides in these 500 pages." [...] David Kipen of the San Francisco Chronicle agreed, opining [...] "mong <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>things,</b> this praiseworthy, prize-worthy yarn succeeds as a heartbroken mash note to the Detroit of Eugenides' birth, a city whose neighborhoods he sometimes appears to love—as he loves his characters—less for their virtues than for their defects. Any book that can make a reader actively want to visit Detroit must have one honey of a tiger in its tank." ...|$|E

I am saying that it’s clear to everyone, to the world, that serious transgressions had been committed by the previous administration.

2500|$|In a {{negative}} review, Flickering Myth critiqued that [...] "Some stories just don’t need telling, and Leatherface {{is one of}} them. It's not that it retcons elements of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre mythology, or that it's a 'pointless prequel' – it's just an empty movie. You'll have forgotten you've seen {{it as soon as}} the credits roll. Prequels, sequels and remakes can all enrich a story and tell it from a new perspective, but Leatherface just doesn’t do that."Screen International called the film [...] "a production line effort with an eye on cashflow rather than the demented work of art Hooper loosed on the world", stating [...] "this eighth entry is above average for its attenuated series. Gore levels are as high as expected and, naturally, the finale leaves things open for further installments." [...] Regarding the film's viewer appeal, HeyUGuys theorised, [...] "Not only is this prequel attempting to deliver something fans of the series don't necessarily want, it doesn't really do what it promises particularly well either. One for completists for sure, but on the whole Leatherface is too detached for TCM fans, and too extreme for the wider public." [...] William Bibbiani of IGN ranked it as the worst Texas Chainsaw Massacre film because [...] "it adds nothing new or interesting to the series. The problem is not just that this film is a prequel, so we know exactly where it’s going, but that the road to the inevitable takes us through almost unbearably familiar territory. It honestly looks as though the filmmakers who made Leatherface didn't watch the original films, but watched all of the films that ripped off The Texas Chain Saw Massacre instead." [...] Film critic Rob Gonsalves reviewed that [...] "Hooper's Chainsaw is often imitated, never duplicated (or bested, say I), a sui generis sweatbox odyssey that seems to owe nothing to any other film before it. Leatherface feels properly respectful, made by filmmakers who idolize the original, and that’s also its weakness: it's a jumped-up fan film, and because it's meant to be a prequel to Hooper's movie it's locked into whatever happens in that movie. It can't deviate from what we know, and can't truly surprise us." [...] Heather Wixson of Daily Dead went into Leatherface [...] "primed to love it", but felt that the final product [...] "never quite makes up its mind about just what kind of movie it wants to be, and suffers for its indecision. But as a whole, Leatherface is such a disappointing entry because it spends so much time trying to be <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> than just a straight-up Texas Chainsaw movie, and I couldn't help but wonder why." [...] Wixson commended the cinematography, practical effects, and Lili Taylor's acting, but slammed the third act.|$|E
