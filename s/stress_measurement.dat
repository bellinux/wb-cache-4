25|$|Although Griffith {{was well}} known due to his earlier work on metal fatigue and <b>stress</b> <b>measurement,</b> little work appears to have started {{as a direct result}} of his paper. The only obvious effort was a {{test-bed}} compressor built by Hayne Constant, Griffith's colleague at the Royal Aircraft Establishment. Other early jet efforts, notably those of Frank Whittle and Hans von Ohain, were based on the more robust and better understood centrifugal compressor which was widely used in superchargers. Griffith had seen Whittle's work in 1929 and dismissed it, noting a mathematical error, and going on to claim that the frontal size of the engine would make it useless on a high-speed aircraft.|$|E

But 1 -D method requires large equipment and it is practically impossible to measure stress in power plants. In order to overcome this problem, we adopted 2 -D X-ray method which requires significantly smaller equipment.

For this, the effects of structural and metallurgical properties on the magnetoacoustic interaction have been studied for various types of steel samples.

5000|$|Aviation is a high-stress industry, {{given that}} it {{requires}} {{a high level of}} precision at all times. Chronically high stress levels can ultimately decrease performance and compromise safety. [...] To be effective, <b>stress</b> <b>measurement</b> tools must be specific to the aviation industry, given its unique working environment and other stressors. <b>Stress</b> <b>measurement</b> in aviation seeks to quantify the psychological stress experienced by aviators, with the goal of making needed improvements to aviators' coping and stress management skills.|$|E
40|$|The {{characteristic}} {{dependence of}} ultrasonic velocity on stress has {{for a long}} time been thought promising for residual <b>stress</b> <b>measurements</b> in materials. A review of theory and experimental methods can be found in [1, 2, 3]. The major problem in practical utilization of most of these techniques is the necessity of separating the effects of texture (anisotropy) and stress on the measured ultrasonic velocity.

40|$|To perform neutron {{residual}} <b>stress</b> <b>measurements</b> it {{is often}} necessary to cut samples to a manageable size. The effects of cutting a girth welded pipe were investigated with analytical methods and finite element analysis. The effect of cutting on measured stresses was calculated. A simplified method of modelling residual stresses in welds, "chill modelling", is introduced. In ring slitting a cut {{is made in the}} axial direction and the deformation is maeesured.

Numerous residual <b>stresses</b> <b>measurements</b> on heat-treatment steel specimens with different masses were made. To measure the residual stresses, the relaxation method was used, involving gradual mechanical {{removal of the}} hardened layer in which the deformation of the specimen was measured by resistance strain gauges. On {{the basis of the}} measured strain at a specific depth of material removal, it is possible to calculate the size or variation of residual stresses depending on the depth of the hardened layer. Numerous residual <b>stresses</b> <b>measurements</b> provided very important data on various steels when using different quenching agents...|$|R
5000|$|Plant <b>stress</b> <b>measurement</b> is the {{quantification}} {{of environmental}} effects on plant health. When plants {{are subjected to}} less than ideal growing conditions, they {{are considered to be}} under stress. Stress factors can affect growth, survival and crop yields. Plant stress research looks at the response of plants to limitations and excesses of the main abiotic factors (light, temperature, water and nutrients), and of other stress factors that are important in particular situations (e.g. pests, pathogens, or pollutants). Plant <b>stress</b> <b>measurement</b> usually focuses on taking measurements from living plants. It can involve visual assessments of plant vitality, however, more recently the focus has moved to the use of instruments and protocols that reveal the response of particular processes within the plant (especially, photosynthesis, plant cell signalling and plant secondary metabolism) ...|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the seismic hazard of an area it is necessary not only to know where potentially active faults are, but also the orientation of the stress field. This is normally derived from a combination of earthquake data, borehole breakout analysis, direct <b>stress</b> <b>measurement</b> and the analysis of geologically young fault networks. The World Stress Map Project provides a useful online compilation of such data.|$|E

Changes in the {{acoustic}} natural velocity for plate samples with their long axes perpendicular, parallel, and in a 40 degree direction {{with respect to the}} rolling axis were measured; graphs of the velocity variations for the three samples are provided. It is observed that the negative minimum change in the acoustic natural velocity under residual compression for the perpendicular sample is about half that of the parallel and 40 degree samples indicating that the functional form of the velocity curve is influenced by the structural properties of the sample; however, the <b>stress</b> <b>measurements</b> are unaffected by the texture...|$|R
40|$|In situ {{horizontal}} stresses {{were measured}} {{to determine the}} influences of geologic anomalies on the regional horizontal stress field in two coal mines in southern Illinois. <b>Stress</b> <b>measurements</b> were obtained near a normal fault having a 121 -ft displacement at the AMAX Wabash Mine and a large coalbed want at the Kerr-McGee Galatia No. 5 Mine. Horizontal <b>stress</b> <b>measurements</b> were completed using a Bureau of Mines borehole deformation gauge. The average maximum and minimum horizontal compressional stresses at the Wabash Mine were 1, 400 and 800 psi, with the direction of maximum stress ranging from N 7820 W to N 8320 E. At the Galatia No. 5 Mine, the averages were 1, 500 and 500 psi, with the direction of maximum stress ranging from N 8520 E to N 7520 E. Generally, the geologic anomalies appear to have no dramatic effect of the regional horizontal stresses. However, subtle differences between <b>stress</b> <b>measurements</b> suggest an influence by the fault zone at the Wabash Mine. The larger anisotropic stress conditions at the Galatia No. 5 Mine could {{be responsible for the}} increase in kink zones and directional roof failures...|$|R
40|$|Thermal barrier {{coatings}} (TBCs) {{are important in}} increasing performance and extending the life of gas turbine engine hot parts. Over the course of thermal cycling and engine operation, the coatings eventually spall off exposing superalloys to extreme temperatures. In this thesis, two aspects involving thermal barrier coating life prediction were explored. The first was by making use of <b>stress</b> <b>measurements</b> in the thermally grown oxide (TGO) to predict lives of samples subjected to non-constant furnace testing. This work used data from an earlier thesis {{and for the first}} time developed specific strategies to predict remaining life in the face of changing peak temperatures and hold times. Secondly, the relation between stress and coating life in two new coating systems was explored experimentally with furnace cycling and TGO <b>stress</b> <b>measurements</b> which was done as input for a potential industrial application to aircraft maintenance. Because there was an issue with one of the two samples types supplied, the project was expanded to understand the nature of the defect in some of the samples provided. All research was conducted in service of the goal of allowing TGO <b>stress</b> <b>measurements</b> to be used to predict remaining life of actual engine parts...|$|R

50|$|The hole {{drilling}} method is a method for measuring residual stresses in a material. Residual stress occurs in a material {{in the absence of}} external loads. Residual stress interacts with the applied loading on the material to affect the overall strength, fatigue, and corrosion performance of the material. Residual stresses are measured through experiments. The {{hole drilling}} method {{is one of the most}} used methods for residual <b>stress</b> <b>measurement.</b>|$|E
5000|$|To more {{precisely}} measure stress, aviators' many responsibilities are {{broken down into}} [...] "workloads." [...] This helps to categorise the broad concept of [...] "stress" [...] by specific stressors. [...] Additionally, since different workloads may pose unique stressors, this method {{may be more effective}} than measuring stress levels as a whole. <b>Stress</b> <b>measurement</b> tools can then help aviators identify which stressors are most problematic for them, and help them improve on managing workloads, planning tasks, and coping with stress more effectively.|$|E
