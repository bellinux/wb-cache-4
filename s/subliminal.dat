5|$|Invader has had solo {{exhibitions}} at {{art galleries}} in Paris, Osaka, Melbourne, Los Angeles, New York City, London and Rome. He has {{shown in the}} 6th Lyon contemporary art biennale (2001), the MAMA Gallery in Rotterdam (2002), at the Paris-based Magda Danysz Gallery (2003), at the Borusan Center for Culture and Arts in Istanbul, <b>Subliminal</b> Projects in Los Angeles (2004), and Lazarides in London (2011).|$|E
5|$|The lyrics' {{reference}} {{to an extreme}} length of time is accentuated by the stretching out of an already slow 6/8 metre into 9/8, and, during the verses, by the appending of a measure-long instrumental tag after each two bars of vocal melody. Partly {{as a result of}} the absence of resolution in the home key, the descending bassline in the verses – a 4-3-2-1 sequence of notes mirroring the IV-iii-ii-I chord pattern – establishes an almost <b>subliminal</b> tonic.|$|E
5|$|After Wizkid tweeted a <b>subliminal</b> {{message and}} tweaked his Twitter account, reports about his {{departure}} from E.M.E went viral. Wizkid {{moved out of}} the E.M.E mansion in Lagos and acquired his own home in the Lekki Phase 1 area. Prior to Wizkid's <b>subliminal</b> tweets, Banky W pacified fans by assuring them that nothing was amiss. Furthermore, it was reported that troubles within E.M.E started as early as the 2012 E.M.E all stars concert. It was also reported that money was at the centre of the controversy. On 20 February 2013, Information Nigeria reported that Wizkid was getting 25 percent from every performance, while Banky W and Segun Demuren were getting 50 percent. Osagie, Wizkid's former manager, was getting the remaining 25 percent. After firing Osagie and hiring Godwin Tom (whom he parted ways with in April 2014), Wizkid wanted a 50–50 share with Banky W. The source revealed that Banky W refused to accept Wizkid's proposal. Moreover, it was reported that Banky W wanted to find a manager for Wizkid who would accept 25 percent. It was also reported that things started getting sour as a result of both parties disagreement. Information Nigeria went on to report that Wizkid was doing three shows weekly and bringing in close to ₦24 million monthly. On 30 April 2013, Nigerian Entertainment Today reported that Wizkid and E.M.E reunited after contract negotiations. The news source also reported that Wizkid performed alongside label mates Shaydee and DJ Xclusive in The Republic of Benin. In August 2014, Wizkid told Olisa Adibua that he will depart the label following the release of his second studio album, Ayo.|$|E
5|$|While {{producing}} {{their second}} DVD Disasterpieces in 2002, {{the band members}} of Slipknot were inspired to produce a live album after noticing how well they performed when {{they knew they were}} being recorded. Two years later, in 2004, Slipknot promoted Vol. 3: (The <b>Subliminal</b> Verses) during a world tour which included 233 concerts across 34 countries in 28 months; music for the live album was recorded during the tour. The tracks on 9.0: Live were compiled from performances in Singapore, Tokyo, Osaka, Las Vegas, Phoenix, New York City, and Dallas.|$|E
5|$|In October 2000, Dr John Ryan, an Accident & Emergency {{consultant}} at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton criticised {{the number of}} patients visiting the department for minor ailments without first contacting their GP. Ryan attributed this phenomenon to patients viewing Holby City and American medical drama ER, and falsely perceiving hospitals as glamorous. A three-year Belgian research project, presented at a British Psychological Society meeting in September 2008, claimed that watching Holby City and similar medical dramas such as Casualty and ER had a <b>subliminal</b> influence on fear of illness. 1,300 teenagers were questioned on their viewing habits, and those who watched more medical dramas were found to be up to 10% more fearful about their health, with females more affected than males. Dr Jan Van Mierlo of Hasselt University stated that further research was needed into the long-term impact of television.|$|E
5|$|Investigating one of {{a series}} of {{large-scale}} power outages, Indiana electrical lineman Roy Neary experiences a close encounter with a UFO, when it flies over his truck and lightly burns the side of his face with its bright lights. The UFO, joining a group of three other UFOs, is pursued by Neary and three police cars, but the spacecraft fly off into the night sky. Roy becomes fascinated by UFOs, much to the dismay of his wife, Ronnie. He also becomes increasingly obsessed with <b>subliminal,</b> mental images of a mountain-like shape and begins to make models of it. Jillian also becomes obsessed with sketching a unique-looking mountain. Soon after, she is terrorized in her home by a UFO which descends from the clouds. The presence of the UFO energy field makes every appliance in Jillian's house malfunction and Barry is abducted by unseen beings.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{brings the}} device to the Lone Gunmen, who tell him it is {{emitting}} some kind of signal. Mulder contacts Scully, who is growing increasingly paranoid. Hearing possible clicks while {{on the phone with}} Mulder, she frantically searches her hotel room for monitoring devices. When Mulder knocks at her door, Scully fires her weapon at it and runs off. Mulder believes her to be suffering from paranoid psychosis. The Lone Gunmen believe {{the device to}} be some sort of <b>subliminal</b> mind control device. Mulder was not affected due to his color blindness. The police find a body they believe to be that of Scully, but Mulder confirms that it is not her. Mulder is unable to contact Scully's mother, leading him to go to her house. He finds Scully there, who aims a gun at him. Scully claims Mulder never trusted her and blames him for her abduction and her sister's murder. Scully's mother calms her down, and she is hospitalized.|$|E
5|$|Two sculptures made by Dan Corson were {{installed}} at the station's underground level: Portals consists of a wall of portals with images from the Hubble Space Telescope, microscopes, and the deep sea at the elevator lobby; Space Forms {{is a series of}} brightly-colored, translucent sculptures suspended above the platforms that resemble microscopic creatures floating under a microscope. An additional installation, Bill Bell's Light Sticks, is embedded in the walls of the Beacon Hill Tunnel. A series of LED displays, typically showing images of playing cards, flash for 1/30th of a second through the train windows. The art is considered by Sound Transit an extension of Bell's installation at the University Street station that similarly depends on persistence of vision to project <b>subliminal</b> images.|$|E
5|$|Vol. 3: (The <b>Subliminal</b> Verses) is {{the third}} studio album by American metal band Slipknot. The album was {{released}} on May 25, 2004, by Roadrunner Records, and a special edition, containing a bonus disc, was released on April 12, 2005. It is the band's only album produced by Rick Rubin, and also the only one not to feature any profanity. Following the band's tour to promote its second album in 2002, speculation regarding the future began. Some band members had already been involved in side projects including Murderdolls, To My Surprise, and the reformation of Stone Sour. In 2003, Slipknot moved into The Mansion {{to work on the}} album. Initially, the band was unproductive; lead vocalist Corey Taylor was drinking heavily. Nevertheless, they wrote more than enough material for a new album—the band's first to incorporate more traditional, melodic song structures, guitar solos and acoustic guitars.|$|E
5|$|Early lyrics {{drew on the}} band's {{blues and}} folk roots, often mixing lyrical {{fragments}} from different songs. Many of the band's songs dealt with themes of romance, unrequited love and sexual conquest, which were common in rock, pop and blues music. Some of their lyrics, especially those derived from the blues, have been interpreted as misogynistic. Particularly on Led Zeppelin III, they incorporated elements of mythology and mysticism into their music, which largely grew out of Plant's interest in legends and history. These elements were often taken to reflect Page's interest in the occult, which resulted in accusations that the recordings contained <b>subliminal</b> satanic messages, {{some of which were}} said to be contained in backmasking; these claims were generally dismissed by the band and music critics. Susan Fast argues that as Plant emerged as the band's main lyricist, the songs more obviously reflected his alignment with the West Coast counterculture of the 1960s. In the later part of the band's career Plant's lyrics became more autobiographical, and less optimistic, drawing on his own experiences and circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels {{was first}} offered the {{position}} of party Gauleiter for the Berlin section in August 1926. He travelled to Berlin in mid-September and {{by the middle of}} October accepted the position. Thus Hitler's plan to divide and dissolve the northwestern Gauleiters group that Goebbels had served in under Strasser was successful. Hitler gave Goebbels great authority over the area, allowing him to determine the course for organisation and leadership for the Gau. Goebbels was given control over the local Sturmabteilung (SA) and Schutzstaffel (SS) and answered only to Hitler. The party membership numbered about 1,000 when Goebbels arrived, and he reduced it to a core of 600 of the most active and promising members. To raise money, he instituted membership fees and began charging admission to party meetings. Aware of the value of publicity (both positive and negative), he deliberately provoked beer-hall battles and street brawls, including violent attacks on the Communist Party of Germany. Goebbels adapted recent developments in commercial advertising to the political sphere, including the use of catchy slogans and <b>subliminal</b> cues. His new ideas for poster design included using large type, red ink, and cryptic headers that encouraged the reader to examine the fine print to determine the meaning.|$|E
5|$|The Reich Film Chamber, {{which all}} members of the film {{industry}} were required to join, was created in June 1933. Goebbels promoted the development of films with a Nazi slant, and ones that contained <b>subliminal</b> or overt propaganda messages. Under the auspices of the Reichskulturkammer (Reich Chamber of Culture), created in September, Goebbels added additional sub-chambers for the fields of broadcasting, fine arts, literature, music, the press, and the theatre. As in the film industry, anyone wishing to pursue a career in these fields had {{to be a member of}} the corresponding chamber. In this way anyone whose views were contrary to the regime could be excluded from working in their chosen field and thus silenced. In addition, journalists (now considered employees of the state) were required to prove Aryan descent back to the year 1800, and if married, the same requirement applied to the spouse. Members of any chamber were not allowed to leave the country for their work without prior permission of their chamber. A committee was established to censor books, and works could not be re-published unless they were on the list of approved works. Similar regulations applied to other fine arts and entertainment; even cabaret performances were censored. Many German artists and intellectuals left Germany in the pre-war years rather than work under these restrictions.|$|E
5|$|Varlyn Stroud is a convict. His {{original}} biography gives {{insight into}} his criminal past and names Stroud's sister Clara {{as his first}} murder. When Clara was nine years old, Stroud deliberately upset a Ferris wheel car so Clara fell to her death. Stroud's second murder was his grandfather three years later, which he covered as a hunting accident. Having possibly committed over a dozen contract-killings, Stroud was never convicted of murder, yet still {{spent most of his}} life in prison on a variety of charges. Stroud's story arc in the series begins in season 2 when he hears Brother Justin's radio sermon. Made Brother Justin's apostle in a <b>subliminal</b> message, Stroud escapes prison to find and bring Henry Scudder to Brother Justin. Stroud first tracks Scudder's old life and later follows the route of the carnival. With Ben's unintentional aid, Stroud finally finds the man he is looking for. After delivering Scudder to Brother Justin, Stroud becomes his security manager, which significantly hinders the carnival's aim to kill Brother Justin.|$|E
5|$|While {{working on}} an oil rig, Lenny and Homer accidentally set fire to an ant, who in turn sets fire to all her ant companions, who jump in a puddle of oil to {{extinguish}} the flames. Their brief sighs of relief are replaced with screams as the whole rig catches fire. Marge goes with Artie along with Carl to West Springfield to save Homer and Lenny. At first, they are reluctant, as Homer still thinks that Marge and Artie are having an affair, and Lenny feels {{that there is nothing}} for him in Artie's helicopter. However, Artie finally admits defeat to Homer, saying that winning Marge's love was something that he could never accomplish, even with his billions, and Homer jumps on the ladder to the helicopter. Carl reveals that he is in the helicopter, and Lenny also jumps on to be saved, just before the rig collapses. Homer and Marge's marriage is also apparently saved when Artie offers a solution to Homer's snoring problem, a device which converts snoring to music. However, Artie's voice is soon heard through the device's speaker, giving Marge anti-Homer <b>subliminal</b> messages and eventually saying that he is watching her through a camera.|$|E
25|$|In another variation, {{subjects}} were shown an image on a tachistoscope {{for a very}} brief duration {{that could not be}} perceived consciously. This <b>subliminal</b> exposure produced the same effect, though {{it is important to note}} that <b>subliminal</b> effects are unlikely to occur without controlled laboratory conditions.|$|E
25|$|The physical, {{vital and}} mental levels of being contain both a subconscient and a subtle or <b>subliminal</b> part.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, René noticed {{what seemed to}} him a <b>subliminal</b> image {{embedded}} within the label design of Mott's apple juice cans.|$|E
25|$|Israel has {{developed}} its {{own brand of}} rap and hip hop with groups such as Hadag Nahash, <b>Subliminal,</b> Sagol 59 and Kele 6 performing Israeli hip hop.|$|E
25|$|Before Regan {{grabs the}} psychiatrist's crotch, a new digital effect {{of her face}} {{morphing}} into the devil (which is seen in <b>subliminal</b> cuts throughout) including a new growl has been added.|$|E
25|$|Other {{than the}} <b>subliminal</b> dispute with Fr. Matta El Meskeen, Shenouda got into {{theological}} disputes with Hany Mina Mikhail, George Habib Bebawi -whom he infamously excommunicated- and Henein Abd El Messih.|$|E
25|$|In Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films, Gríma {{was played}} by Brad Dourif. According to Dourif, Jackson {{encouraged}} him to shave off his eyebrows so that the audience would immediately have a <b>subliminal</b> reaction of unease to the character.|$|E
25|$|The Inner Being, or <b>Subliminal,</b> {{includes}} the inner realms or {{aspects of the}} physical, vital and mental being. They have a larger, subtler, freer consciousness {{than that of the}} everyday consciousness. Its realisation is essential for any higher spiritual realisation.|$|E
25|$|It {{is certain}} that the {{combinations}} which present themselves to the mind {{in a kind of}} sudden illumination after a somewhat prolonged period of unconscious work are generally useful and fruitful combinations... all the combinations are formed {{as a result of the}} automatic action of the <b>subliminal</b> ego, but those only which are interesting find their way into the field of consciousness... A few only are harmonious, and consequently at once useful and beautiful, and they will be capable of affecting the geometrician's special sensibility I have been speaking of; which, once aroused, will direct our attention upon them, and will thus give them the opportunity of becoming conscious... In the <b>subliminal</b> ego, on the contrary, there reigns what I would call liberty, if one could give this name to the mere absence of discipline and to disorder born of chance.|$|E
25|$|Walker {{contributed a}} chapter on music to Sound Unbound, Sampling Digital Music and Culture edited by Paul D. Miller aka DJ Spooky that <b>Subliminal</b> Kid (The MIT Press, 2008). Her {{extensive}} use of Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient Works 85–92 to form the soundtrack to Devil's Playground' is discussed in detail in Marc Weidenbaum's book about the album.|$|E
25|$|Huxley {{analysed}} {{the causes}} of this, such as overpopulation, {{as well as all}} the means by which populations can be controlled. He was particularly interested in the effects of drugs and <b>subliminal</b> suggestion. Brave New World Revisited is different in tone because of Huxley's evolving thought, as well as his conversion to Hindu Vedanta in the interim between the two books.|$|E
25|$|On June 15, 1994, Nas's ex-fiancée Carmen Bryan {{gave birth}} to their daughter, Destiny. She later confessed to Nas {{that she had a}} {{relationship}} with his then-rival rapper and nemesis Jay-Z, also accusing Jay-Z of putting <b>subliminal</b> messages in his lyrics about their relationship together, causing an even bigger rift in the feud between the two hit rap music giants.|$|E
25|$|The {{controversial}} barcode {{design was}} removed by Ferrari {{for the start}} of the Spanish Grand Prix in the 2010 season but the barcode remained on drivers team gear. In January 2011, the Scuderia Ferrari presented a new logo for its racing team. This logo is considered by a specialised F1-website as a <b>subliminal</b> advertisement for Marlboro, evocating the top-left corner design of a Marlboro cigarettes pack.|$|E
25|$|On 8 October 2008, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) found Network Ten {{guilty of}} {{breaching}} the Commercial Television Industry Code of Practice by using <b>subliminal</b> advertising during the {{broadcast of the}} 2007 ARIA Music Awards on 28 October 2007. Network Ten had inserted single frames (lasting 1/25th of a second) into the program broadcast. This was exposed on ABC's Media Watch program.|$|E
25|$|A {{far more}} {{atmospheric}} album {{than the previous}} War, The Unforgettable Fire {{was at the time}} the band's most dramatic change in direction. It has a rich and orchestrated sound and was the first U2 album with a cohesive sound. Under Lanois' direction, Larry's drumming became looser, funkier and more subtle, and Adam's bass became more <b>subliminal,</b> such that the rhythm section no longer intruded, but flowed in support of the songs.|$|E
25|$|The British writer Tony Barrell has {{explored}} urban legends in a long-running column in The Sunday Times. These include {{the story that}} Orson Welles began work on a Batman movie in the 1940s, which was to feature James Cagney as the Riddler and Marlene Dietrich as Catwoman; the persistent rumour that the rock singer Courtney Love is the granddaughter of Marlon Brando; {{and the idea that}} in a famous 1970s poster of Farrah Fawcett, there is a <b>subliminal</b> sexual message concealed in the actress's hair.|$|E
25|$|In 1933 Leavis {{published}} For Continuity, {{which was}} a selection of Scrutiny essays. This publication, along with Culture and the Environment (a joint effort with Denys Thompson), {{stressed the importance of}} an informed and discriminating, highly trained intellectual elite whose existence within university English departments would help preserve the cultural continuity of English life and literature. In Education and the University (1943), Leavis argued that ‘there is a prior cultural achievement of language; language is not a detachable instrument of thought and communication. It is the historical embodiment of its community’s assumptions and aspirations at levels which are so <b>subliminal</b> much of the time that language is their only index'.|$|E
25|$|While Mel Gibson {{financed the}} film through his Icon Productions, Disney {{signed on to}} {{distribute}} Apocalypto for a fee in certain markets under the Touchstone Pictures label. The publicity for the film started with a December 2005 teaser trailer that was filmed {{before the start of}} principal photography and before Rudy Youngblood was cast as Jaguar Paw. As a joke, Gibson inserted a <b>subliminal</b> cameo of the bearded director in a plaid shirt with a cigarette hanging from his mouth posing next to a group of dust-covered Maya. A clean-shaven Gibson also filmed a Mayan-language segment for the introduction of the 2006 Academy Awards in which he declined to host the ceremony.|$|E
25|$|Though the backmasking {{controversy}} {{peaked in}} the 1980s, the general belief in <b>subliminal</b> manipulation became more {{widespread in the}} United States during the following decade, with belief in Satanic backmasking on records persisting into the 1990s. At the same time, the development of sound editing software with audio reversal features simplified the process of reversing audio, which previously could only be done with full fidelity using a professional tape recorder. The Sound Recorder utility, included with Microsoft Windows from Windows 95 to Windows XP, allows one-click audio reversal, as does popular open source sound editing software Audacity. Following {{the growth of the}} Internet, backmasked message searchers used such software to create websites featuring backward music samples, which became a widely used method of exploring backmasking in popular music.|$|E
25|$|Several cultures' backstories had to {{be shown}} through only <b>subliminal</b> glimpses on screen, as are the miniatures, and for the Elves and Gondorians, fictional {{histories}} {{had to be}} presented within the changes of armour. The Elves have an Art Nouveau influence that involves leaves and flowers, whilst the Dwarves have a preoccupation with geometry {{that is supposed to}} remind the audience of their digging nature. The Hobbits hark back to 18th century England, the Rohirrim have numerous horse and sun motifs and draw visual inspiration from Beowulf and the Anglo-Saxon artifacts found in the Sutton Hoo burial ship, and the Gondorians reflect 16th-century German and Italian armour as well as tree motifs. The evil Haradrim Men take influence from Aztecs and Kiribati after bad feedback from Phillipa Boyens over looking African. Most of the Orc armour is sharp, reflecting secateurs, and have runes written on them to reflect a worship of Sauron.|$|E
