'White Pratt From Luton' {{landed on}} No. 34 Toynebee Street on Friday 24 th June, the moment Dominic Allan took receipt of keys from East End Homes. A four-week contract, four {{walls and a}} sink. Half decent lighting, peeling paint and raw plugs showing their arses. A space that’s given {{everything}} of itself to artists Laura White, Robert Pratt and Dominic Allan. A bespoke A 3 lightbox sits in the window. ‘White Pratt From Luton’ is coming. Turned on. 24 / 7. There really is a light that never goes out. Dominic Allan sits {{in the back room}} in his Father’s burnt out wheelchair as Margaret ‘Milk Snatcher’ Thatcher, praying in a public toilet somewhere in Hackney. Very firmly glazed and framed. Laura White’s unwearable yet unbearably beautiful Halo floats, looking at Thatcher, Thatcher looking at Halo. The space is sliced (enter) back room. Robert Pratt’s empty freestanding triptych. A son of Toynebee. You wouldn’t want to stand here. No high-viz in <b>sight.</b> <b>Pack</b> it up and return it to the outside. Take your rubber sole with you. More reclamation, more art mirroring life. Again Pratt prowls. Sunblest white bread baskets sit next to cast screwed up paper. With or Without You. In Pratt’s case, With. And then ‘Anxious Glory’. Like James Cameron’s Titantic on a poundland budget, Laura White wraps all the objects she’d die for then crucifies them over a shower tray. Floor to ceiling. As you enter and as you leave. Bigger than me. An unknown soldier looks down from his Mum’s bedroom. A rat and a statement about our postal service...|$|E

5000|$|On Wednesday, December 12, 2012, {{at about}} 2:00AM, in Waltham, Massachusetts, {{on the campus}} of Brandeis University, an animal, thought to be a coyote, {{attacked}} a student walking back to her dorm. The animal appeared from dense cover and in a very dark location, and quickly disappeared, so the victim did not get a good look. Multiple residents had <b>sighted</b> a <b>pack</b> of coyotes in the area. The woman was treated for a tooth or claw wound.|$|R
50|$|Mostly, adults end up {{preparing}} Chigali {{for kids}} to stop their pestering for it. Chigali is also a tool for adults, taking either {{the form of an}} incentive or a bribe or a reward or to soothe/pacify a crying child. Often the tangy treat once prepared does not remain untasted by entire family. Chigali is associated with fond memories of fun and mischief, togetherness, and the playfulness of childhood for adults. At times, women in pregnancy crave for it and relish it. Sometimes, visits to malls and supermarkets evoke nostalgia upon <b>sight</b> of <b>packed</b> Chigali candies.|$|R
5|$|The soundtrack for The Last of Us {{comprises}} {{songs from}} the game, composed and produced by Gustavo Santaolalla. The soundtrack spans thirty tracks, covering a duration of 56 minutes. Sony Computer Entertainment first published the album digitally via iTunes on June 7, 2013, and physically on June 13, 2013. The soundtrack was also included as pre-order downloadable content in the <b>Sights</b> and Sounds <b>Pack.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{went on to}} talk of {{the strange}} {{contrasts}} of war, of such things as the indifference of the birds to gunfire and desolation. One day on the Carso he had been near the newly captured Austrian trenches, and suddenly from amidst a scattered mass of Austrian bodies a quail had risen that had struck him as odd, and so too had the <b>sight</b> of a <b>pack</b> of cards and a wine flask on some newly-made graves. The ordinary life was a very obstinate thing....|$|R
60|$|Yet the {{excitement}} {{caused by the}} approach of a pedlar was invincible, even by Madame la Duchess. It was inevitable that the crying need of glove, kerchief, needle, or the like, should be discovered {{as soon as he}} came within ken, and, once in the hall, there was no being rid of him except by a flagrant act of inhospitality. This time it was worst of all, for M. le Marquis himself must needs be the first to spy him, bring him in, and be in want of a silver chain for his hawk; and his brother the Vicomte must follow him up with all manner of wants inspired by the mere <b>sight</b> of the <b>pack.</b>|$|R
5|$|Downloadable content (DLC) for {{the game}} was {{released}} following its launch.

"I {{tell you}} this is none," [...] said Lord Dalgarno; [...] "it is but, in plain terms, an eating-house, {{arranged}} on civiller terms, and frequented by better company, than others in this town; and if {{some of them do}} amuse themselves with cards and hazard, they are men of honour, and who play as such, and for no more than they can well afford to lose. It was not, and could not be, such houses that your father desired you to avoid. Besides, {{he might as well have}} made you swear you would never take accommodation of an inn, tavern, eating-house, or place of public reception of any kind; for there is no such place of public resort but where your eyes may be contaminated by the <b>sight</b> of a <b>pack</b> of pieces of painted pasteboard, and your ears profaned by the rattle of those little spotted cubes of ivory. The difference is, that where we go, we may happen to see persons of quality amusing themselves with a game; and in the ordinary houses you will meet bullies and sharpers, who will strive either to cheat or to swagger you out of your money." ...|$|R
60|$|When Policles {{came into}} the suburbs, he found them deserted; {{but he was still}} more {{surprised}} when he reached the main street to see no single human being in the place. He hastened his steps, therefore, and as he approached the theatre he was conscious of a low sustained hum which announced the concourse of a huge assembly. Never in all his dreams had he imagined any musical competition upon so vast a scale as this. There were some soldiers clustering outside the door; but Policles pushed his way swiftly through them, and found himself upon the outskirts of the multitude who filled the great space formed by roofing over a portion of the national stadium. Looking around him, Policles saw a great number of his neighbours, whom he knew by <b>sight,</b> tightly <b>packed</b> upon the benches, all with their eyes fixed upon the stage. He also observed that there were soldiers round the walls, and that a considerable part of the hall was filled by a body of youths of foreign aspect, with white gowns and long hair. All this he perceived; but what it meant he could not imagine. He bent over to a neighbour to ask him, but a soldier prodded him at once with the butt end of his spear, and commanded him fiercely to hold his peace. The man whom he had addressed, thinking that Policles had demanded a seat, pressed closer to his neighbour, and so the shepherd found himself sitting {{at the end of the}} bench which was nearest to the door. Thence he concentrated himself upon the stage, on which Metas, a well-known minstrel from Corinth and an old friend of Policles, was singing and playing without much encouragement from the audience. To Policles it seemed that Metas was having less than his due, so he applauded loudly, but he was surprised to observe that the soldiers frowned at him, and that all his neighbours regarded him with some surprise. Being a man of strong and obstinate character, he was the more inclined to persevere in his clapping when he perceived that the general sentiment was against him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Everybody {{stand back}} an' give me elbow room," [...] ordered Jean, majestically. [...] "My good folks, I want {{you all to}} know this is somethin' that doesn't happen often. The bundle you see here weighed about a hundred pounds when I packed it on my {{shoulder}} down Market Street in Frisco. It was stolen from me on shipboard. I got it back in San Diego an' licked the thief. It rode on a burro from San Diego to Yuma an' once I thought the burro was lost for keeps. It came up the Colorado River from Yuma to Ehrenberg an' there went {{on top of a}} stage. We got chased by bandits an' once when the horses were gallopin' hard it near rolled off. Then it went {{on the back of a}} pack horse an' helped wear him out. An' I reckon it would be somewhere else now if I hadn't fallen in with a freighter goin' north from Phoenix to the Santa Fe Trail. The last lap when it sagged the back of a mule was the riskiest an' full of the narrowest escapes. Twice my mule bucked off his pack an' left my outfit scattered. Worst of all, my precious bundle made the mule top heavy comin' down that place back here where the trail seems to drop off the earth. There I was hard put to keep <b>sight</b> of my <b>pack.</b> Sometimes it was on top an' other times the mule. But it got here at last.... An' now I'll open it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Her tenth patrol, out of Pearl Harbor on 11 August, {{found her}} in a new wolf pack, nicknamed [...] "Ben's Busters" [...] after Growler’s skipper, Commander T.B. ("Ben") Oakley; in company with [...] and , {{she headed for the}} Formosa Straits area. Aided greatly by {{reconnaissance}} and guidance from friendly aircraft, the wolf pack closed a convoy for night surface action 31 August; their torpedoes plunged the Japanese into chaos, with their own ships shooting at each other in the dark, but no sinkings were reported. Two weeks later, 12 September, the wolf <b>pack</b> <b>sighted</b> a second convoy and closed for torpedo action. A destroyer spotted Growler and attacked her, but the sub calmly fired a spread of torpedoes at the oncoming destroyer. Heavily damaged by the torpedoes, the flaming destroyer bore down on Growler and only adroit maneuvering took the submarine out of the enemy's way; paint on the bridge was seared by the heat of the passing destroyer. Meantime Growler’s other torpedoes and those of Sealion and Pampanito were hitting the convoy, and when Ben's Busters returned to Fremantle submarine base, Western Australia on 26 September, they were credited with a total of six enemy ships. Growler had sunk the destroyer Shikinami and the frigate Hirado; her companions also racked up two kills each. Two of the sunken vessels, Rakuyo Maru and Kachidoki Maru, were transporting Allied prisoners of the Japanese; the three submarines rescued over 150 Allied prisoners. This difficult operation had been carried out despite rough seas caused by an approaching typhoon.|$|R
40|$|The African wild dog Lycaon pictus is Africa’s {{second most}} {{endangered}} carnivore. Only 14 out of 39 countries in Africa still have wild dogs present. This makes {{the populations of}} wild dogs in South Africa very valuable {{with respect to the}} entire species. Kruger National Park (Kruger) has the only self-sustaining and viable population of wild dogs in South Africa, making Kruger the core area of conservation for South African wild dogs. It is of vital importance to know the numbers of wild dogs present in Kruger. In chapter 2 of this dissertation I monitored and gathered demographic information from as many southern Kruger wild dog packs and individuals as possible over a three month period. I used real time text messaging to collect the information. A wild dog hotline number was used for tourists to contact immediately after they <b>sighted</b> a <b>pack,</b> noting location, time and number of wild dogs sighted. This new technique resulted in more than 300 reported wild dog sightings in three months enabling a count of individuals and packs. This also created an opportunity to take identification photographs and to collect DNA samples. In 1997 it was decided to establish and manage several small wild dog populations in various geographically isolated reserves in South Africa as one large managed metapopulation. In order to simulate the natural dispersal patterns of wild dogs, individuals are translocated between the managed metapopulation reserves, imitating natural gene flow and hopefully preventing inbreeding. To date, all decisions have been made using demographic data only. This in time is likely to result in a loss of genetic diversity and subsequent inbreeding. The aim of chapter 3 was to obtain genetic information from wild dogs in the managed metapopulation and Kruger (chapter 2) to provide a basis for sound population management including monitoring of inbreeding and maintaining levels of genetic diversity similar to those found in large self-sustaining populations (such as Kruger). This study included both mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear microsatellite loci to determine the genetic structure of South Africa’s wild dogs specifically with regards to genetic diversity, population structure and relatedness. The results showed a difference in historical and recent diversity between the managed metapopulation and Kruger. Two genetic clusters were evident in South Africa, however one was due to wild dogs from Botswana being translocated into the managed metapopulation. After the Botswana influence was removed from the analysis, three genetic clusters were observed in the South African wild dogs. These three genetic clusters comprise too few wild dogs to manage them as separate units. Relatedness between and within populations, reserves and packs were estimated and can in future be used to guide translocations of wild dogs to maximise their genetic variability. It is suggested that due to the low numbers, and historical and recent trends in genetic structure of South Africa’s wild dogs, they should be managed as one unit, allowing movements to and from neighbouring countries. All translocations should follow an isolation-by-distance pattern. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010. Animal and Wildlife Sciencesunrestricte...|$|R
