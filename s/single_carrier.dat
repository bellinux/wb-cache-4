25|$|<b>Single</b> <b>carrier</b> {{devices are}} {{typically}} {{used to study}} the kinetics and charge transport mechanisms of an organic material and can be useful when trying to study energy transfer processes. As current through the device is composed of only one type of charge carrier, either electrons or holes, recombination does not occur and no light is emitted. For example, electron only devices {{can be obtained by}} replacing ITO with a lower work function metal which increases the energy barrier of hole injection. Similarly, hole only devices can be made by using a cathode made solely of aluminium, resulting in an energy barrier too large for efficient electron injection.|$|E

25|$|The yard's slow {{work after}} the war was a symptom of having a glut of extra ships that were {{available}} for the United States Merchant Marine. The passage of the Merchant Ship Sales Act of 1946 meant that ships could be sold {{for as little as}} $ (equivalent to roughly $ in today's dollars) per deadweight ton. The flip side of this glut of ships was that there was a prediction that in 1961, more ships would be need to be constructed. This was evidenced by the fact that in 1954, there were orders for five tankers, one fleet oiler, and five destroyers. The next year, the yard attempted {{to become part of the}} building of the Forrestal-class aircraft carriers when Bethlehem objected to the awarding of the contracts to the Newport News Shipbuilding and the New York Naval Yard. Although the company pointed out that it had produced many carriers during World War II, Newport News pointed out that the company never requested an improvement of its shipbuilding facilities by the government during the war, which hampered its future bidding of aircraft carrier construction. That it had not built a <b>single</b> <b>carrier</b> since the end of the war also hurt its chances. The yard was later rewarded four frigates to build instead.|$|E

40|$|This paper tests {{whether the}} {{observed}} dominance of most city-pair markets and airports in the U.

The results of fixed-effects estimation indicate that airport dominance by a carrier does confer upon it substantial pricing power, whereas dominance at the route level seems to confer no such pricing power. Additionally, the authors find a positive, yet small, correlation between both route concentration, and price and airport concentration and price. The quantitative importance of airport dominance reveals that the most promising direction for public polic y aimed at improving the industry's performance is to ensure equal acc ess to sunk airport facilities.
