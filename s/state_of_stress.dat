25|$|Glacial loads {{provided}} more than 30 MPa of vertical stress in northern Canada {{and more than}} 20 MPa in northern Europe during glacial maximum. This vertical stress {{is supported by the}} mantle and the flexure of the lithosphere. Since the mantle and the lithosphere continuously respond to the changing ice and water loads, the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> at any location continuously changes in time. The changes in the orientation of the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> is recorded in the postglacial faults in southeastern Canada. When the postglacial faults formed at the end of deglaciation 9000 years ago, the horizontal principal stress orientation was almost perpendicular to the former ice margin, but today the orientation is in the northeast-southwest, along the direction of seafloor spreading at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. This shows that the stress due to postglacial rebound had played an important role at deglacial time, but has gradually relaxed so that tectonic stress has become more dominant today.|$|E

40|$|The article {{presents}} a systematic {{review of the}} available tectonophysical data on the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> crustal uplifts and basins in intracontinental orogens. Based on results of the tectonophysical analysis of data on earthquake focal mechanisms for the Altai-Sayan and Northern Tien Shan regions, it is established {{that in many cases}} the crust in the basins and uplifts has antipodal structures, considering various types <b>of</b> the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>stresses.</b> In the crust of the uplifts, maximum compression axes are usually sub-horizontal; in the crust of the basins, only the axis <b>of</b> the principal <b>stress</b> <b>of</b> minimum compression (i. e. maximum deviatoric extension) is sub-horizontal. These observations correlate well with estimations of deformations {{on the surface of the}} crust on the basis of the GPS-geodesy data, as well as with stress measurements taken directly on mining sites. The antipodal structures and physical fields in the crust of the uplifts and basins are not a random phenomenon. This suggests a common mechanism of deformation at the stage of active formation of the uplifts and basins.  However, results of a similar tectonophysical analysis performed for the crust of the Pamir plateau and Tibet show that minimum compression stresses are subhorizontal in these regions, and the geodynamic type <b>of</b> the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>stresses</b> is determined as horizontal extension or horizontal shearing. This pattern contrasts sharply with the type <b>of</b> the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>stresses</b> <b>of</b> horizontal compression in the crust of the mountain ranges around the plateau (the Himalayas, Kunlun, Tsilian Shan, Hindu Kush), as well as with the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>stresses</b> <b>of</b> active orogenic structures of the Tien Shan and Altai-Sayan regions. Based on the stress values estimated for a range of geodynamic types <b>of</b> the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>stresses,</b> it is estimated that additional compression <b>stresses</b> <b>of</b> the order of 5. 4 kbar are required for the transition from horizontal extension to horizontal compression. If the regional strain rates currently recorded by the GPS-geodesy are taken into account, such additional stresses need to be applied for about 10 million years to fulfill the transition. </p...|$|R

25|$|The {{pressure}} {{at the bottom}} of the mantle is ~136 GPa (1.4 million atm). Pressure increases as depth increases, since the material beneath has to support the weight of all the material above it. The entire mantle, however, is thought to deform like a fluid on long timescales, with permanent plastic deformation accommodated by the movement of point, line, and/or planar defects through the solid crystals comprising the mantle. Estimates for the viscosity of the upper mantle range between 1019 and 1024 Pa·s, depending on depth, temperature, composition, <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress,</b> and numerous other factors. Thus, the upper mantle can only flow very slowly. However, when large forces are applied to the uppermost mantle it can become weaker, and this effect is thought to be important in allowing the formation of tectonic plate boundaries.|$|E
25|$|The {{process whereby}} {{the human body}} {{responds}} to extended stress is known as general adaptation syndrome (GAS). After the initial fight-or-flight response, the body becomes more resistant to stress {{in an attempt to}} dampen the sympathetic nervous response and return to homeostasis. During this period of resistance, physical and mental symptoms of CSR may be drastically reduced as the body attempts to cope with the stress. Long combat involvement, however, may keep the body from homeostasis and thereby deplete its resources and render it unable to normally function, sending it into the third stage of GAS: exhaustion. Sympathetic nervous activation remains in the exhaustion phase and reactions to stress are markedly sensitized as fight-or-flight symptoms return. If the body remains in a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress,</b> then such more severe symptoms of CSR as cardiovascular and digestive involvement may present themselves. Extended exhaustion can permanently damage the body.|$|E

40|$|The main {{function}} of the ground floor is to transmit static and dynamic loads and to save performance over required time in environment {{of the influence of}} different agents. Because of the hard exploitation conditions, together with the influence of different agents that destruct the ground floors, they must fulfill some usable requirements. To fulfill the service life requirements that are connected with the concrete ground floors, they must get the proper structure.

The solid cylindrical specimens machined to different height (h) to the diameter (d) ratios namely h/d= 1, h/d= 0. 75 and h/d= 0. 5 were compressed between the two flat cylindrical dies using a 100 ton capacity UTM. These billets were deformed to different strain levels. At each and every stage of the incremental strain, the various elements of the geometry such as contact diameter at the die/billet interface, bulged diameter at the equatorial region and the height after deformation were noted down. The significance of measuring the various elements of the geometry is to predict the value <b>of</b> <b>stresses</b> namely axial stress, hoop stress, hydrostatic stress and effective stress which influence the ductility or formability of the material. The stresses induced in the billets were predicted using the empirical equations and a comparison has been made for uni-axial, bi-axial and tri-axial <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>stresses</b> for different aspect ratios.

Creep damage is one of the serious problems for the high temperature industries and computational creep damage has been developed and used, complementary to the experimental approach, to assist safe operation. In creep damage mechanics, a set of constitutive equations needs to be developed and validated. Recently, a mechanism based approach for the developing creep damage constitutive equation for this type of high Cr alloy has merged and several versions of creep damage constitutive equations have been proposed.

2500|$|Weight2: Weight {{can also}} be {{interpreted}} as that quantity which is measured when one uses scales. What is being measured there is the force exerted by the body on the scales. In a standard weighing operation, the body being weighed {{is in a state}} of equilibrium as a result of a force exerted on it by the weighing machine cancelling the gravitational field. By Newton's 3rd law, there is an equal and opposite force exerted by the body on the machine. This force is called weight2. The force is not gravitational. Typically, it is a contact force and not uniform across the mass of the body. [...] If the body is placed on the scales in a lift (an elevator) in free fall in pure uniform gravity, the scale would read zero, and the body said to be weightless i.e. its weight2 = 0. This describes the condition in which the body is stress free and undeformed. This is the weightlessness in free fall in a uniform gravitational field.
