Mouse interfaces still dominate desktop platforms due to their portability, ergonomic design and large number of possible interactions. In this paper we present a prototype for a new interface based on cheap consumer-level hardware, which combines advantages of the mouse and touch interface, but additionally allows the detection of 3 D depth values. This is achieved by using a web cam and point light source and detecting hand and shadow gestures in order to compute 3 D finger tip positions. Our evaluation shows that the concept is feasible and more powerful interactions than with traditional interfaces can be achieved. Limitations include a reduced input precision, insufficient stability of the utilised computer vision algorithms, and the requirement of a <b>stable</b> <b>lighting</b> environment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{question}} of involvement of glucocorticoid hormones as temporal signals for the synchronization of the timekeeping system was addressed in rats with different corticosterone status. The authors showed that adrenalectomy had no {{effects on the}} synchronization of wheel-running activity rhythms to a steady-state LD 12 : 12 cycle, {{regardless of whether it}} was compensated for by a cortico-sterone replacement therapy that either reinstated constant plasma con-centrations of the hormone or mimicked its natural rhythm. However, after a 12 -h phase shift (daylight reversal), the lack of circulating corticosterone induced a significant shortening of the resynchronization rate (less than 3 days vs. 7 days). Normalization required restoration of a rhythmic corticosterone secretion that was synchronized to the new photoperiod. Under constant darkness, the corticosterone rhythm did not show any synchronizing effect, providing evi-dence that it participates in entrainment of the locomotor activity rhythm through modulation of light effects. It is proposed that, under <b>stable</b> <b>lighting</b> con-ditions, circulating glucocorticoids contribute to stabilizing activity rhythms b...|$|E

However, its performance degrades significantly when the intra-variation in relation to image appearance occurs within the same category. To solve this problem, we propose a new method, integrating the semantically meaningful attributes into deep learning’s hierarchical structure.

The approach capitalizes upon our near-IR skin detection method reported elsewhere [13][14]. It ascertains the existence of a face within the skin region by finding the eyes and eyebrows. The eyeeyebrow pairs are determined by extracting appropriate features from multiple near-IR bands. Very successful feature extraction is achieved by simple algorithmic means like integral projections and template matching. This is because processing is constrained in the skin region and aided by the near-IR phenomenology. The effectiveness of our method is substantiated by comparative experimental results with the Identix face detector IS]...|$|E

Bergasa et al. [5] have also developed a nonintrusive system using infrared light illumination this system computes the driver's vigilance level using a finite state automata (FSM) [16] with six different eye states that compute several indices, among them, PERCLOS; this system is also capable of detecting inattention considering a facial posture analysis.

Systems using NIR illumination work well under <b>stable</b> <b>lighting</b> conditions [5, 18]; however, these systems present drawbacks for applications in real vehicles, where the light continually changes.

However, {{these studies have}} also highlighted an inconsistent relationship between the actual lighted area and {{the boundaries of the}} urban areas considered. Applying detection frequency thresholds can reduce the spatial overextent of lighted area (“blooming”) but thresholding also attenuates large numbers of smaller lights and significantly reduces the information content of the night lights datasets. Spatial analysis of the widely used 1994 / 95 <b>stable</b> <b>lights</b> data and the newly released 1992 / 93 and 2000 <b>stable</b> <b>lights</b> datasets quantifies the tradeoff between blooming and attenuation of smaller lights.

Spatial analysis of light size distributions reveals that conurbations larger than 80 km diameter account for 90 % can often reconcile lighted area with built area in the 94 / 95 dataset but there is not one threshold that works for a majority of the 17 cities considered. Comparison of lighted area with blooming extent for 10 lighted islands suggests a linear proportionality of 1. 25 of lighted to built diameter and an additive bias of 2. 7 km.

40|$|Since {{the year}} 1996, when NAKAMURA {{demonstrated}} his first InGaN blue LEDs {{that can be}} combined with luminescent materials to create high brightness phosphor converted LEDs (PC-LEDs), the third revolution of lighting with LEDs had begun officially. Nowadays, the luminous efficacy of some cold white PC-LEDs can achieve a value of about 140 lm/W. Moreover, by an appropriate combination of color semiconductor LEDs and white PC-LEDs in hybrid LED-lamps, their spectra can be controlled dynamically. However, unfortunately the optical, radiant and colorimetric properties of LEDs vary strongly according to their forward current and their operating temperature. Consequently, {{it will be impossible}} to manufacture good and stable quality solid state luminaries, as well to optimize and stabilize their spectra, if LED properties are not characterized appropriately by transient LED models. Therefore, in this thesis the variation of LED properties must be investigated practically and the intrinsic physical and chemical phenomena taking place inside LEDs must be studied entirely. Hence, the difficulties in the applying, control and operation of LEDs will also be recognized. As well, the accurate characterization of the properties of LEDs by the development of the transient LED models will be carried out. Then, these transient LED models will be applied to the optimization and stabilization of the lighting quality aspects of high qualitative hybrid LED-lamps adapted to the colored surface objects. In that, an available LED combination with optimized / stabilized algorithms in the microcontrollers of hybrid LED-lamps will make the solid state luminaries achieve the high and <b>stable</b> <b>lighting</b> quality with the high luminous efficacy and the optimal spectra possible. In addition, color objects in the lighting application must also be identified specifically by their spectral reflectance distributions. As a result, the adaptive and optimal control factors will create the high qualitative hybrid LED-lamps that can satisfy the lighting demand of the color objects. Finally, high quality solid state lighting systems with these hybrid LED-lamps are the main aim of the thesis. ...|$|E
40|$|An {{automated}} {{vision system}} performs critical tasks in video surveillance, while decreasing costs and increasing efficiency. It can provide high quality scene monitoring without {{the limitations of}} human distraction and fatigue. Advances in embedded processors, wireless networks, and imager technology have enabled computer vision systems to be deployed pervasively in stationary surveillance monitors, hand-held devices, and vehicular sensors. However, the size, weight, power, and cost requirements of these platforms present a great challenge in developing real-time systems. This dissertation explores the development of background modeling algorithms for surveillance on embedded platforms. Our contributions are as follows: - An efficient pixel-based adaptive background model, called multimodal mean, which produces results comparable to the widely used mixture of Gaussians multimodal approach, at a much reduced computational cost and greater control of occluded object persistence. - A novel and efficient chromatic clustering-based background model for embedded vision platforms that leverages the color uniformity of large, permanent background objects to yield significant speedups in execution time. - A multi-scale temporal model for midground analysis which provides a means to "tune-in" {{to changes in the}} scene beyond the standard background/foreground framework, based on user-defined temporal constraints. Multimodal mean reduces instruction complexity with the use of fixed integer arithmetic and periodic long-term adaptation that occurs once every d frames. When combined with fixed thresholding, it performs 6. 2 times faster than the mixture of Gaussians method while using 18 % less storage. Furthermore, fixed thresholding compares favorably to standard deviation thresholding with a percentage difference in error less than five percent when used on scenes with <b>stable</b> <b>lighting</b> conditions and modest multimodal activity. The chromatic clustering-based approach to optimized background modeling takes advantage of the color distributions in large permanent background objects, such as a road, building, or sidewalk, to speedup execution time. It abstracts their colors to a small color palette and suppresses their adaptation during processing. When run on a representative embedded platform it reduces storage usage by 58 % and increases runtime execution by 45 %. Multiscale temporal modeling for midground analysis presents a unified approach for scene analysis that can be applied to several application domains. It extends scene analysis from the standard background/foreground framework to one that includes a temporal midground object saliency window that is defined by the user. When applied to stationary object detection, the midground model provides accurate results at low sampling frame rates (~ 1 fps) while using only 18 Mbytes of storage and 15 Mops/sec processing throughput.

40|$|The routine {{castration}} of male piglets, {{which is}} performed {{in many countries}} to avoid boar taint in meat, is a cause for great concern in terms of animal welfare. Castrates also have reduced feed efficiency and more fat than do entire males. More of the ingested energy therefore goes to fat tissue than to muscle tissue. The European wild boar is a seasonal short-day breeder and although domestic pigs breed all year round {{there are indications that}} they remain responsive to photoperiod. Since boar taint is closely associated with male sexual maturation, the use of artificial light regimens to delay puberty could be a non-invasive method of reducing boar taint in entire males. Therefore, a series of experiments were performed in order to study photoperiodism in young pigs. In two experiments, matched winter-born siblings of crossbred males were allocated after weaning to either one of two light-sealed rooms with high-intensity light regimens or a conventional stable environment. In the first study, groups subjected to an 'artificial autumn' treatment and an 'artificial spring' treatment were compared with a 'natural spring' group. Animals in the 'artificial autumn' group were less sexually mature at the time of slaughter than were those of the 'natural spring' group, which probably was due to the abrupt and large increase in photoperiod for the 'artificial autumn' group. At the start of the second experiment, animals were transferred from 6. 5 h of natural light to 12 h of artificial light. Thereafter, the 'artificial winter' group were exposed to short days, whereas the 'artificial summer' group had long days and both were compared with a 'natural spring' group. At slaughter, the 'artificial summer' group showed immature spermatogenesis and less boar taint than did the 'artificial winter' group. An interesting observation was that all three groups which were exposed to an abrupt shift in photoperiod {{at the start of the}} experiment ('artificial autumn', 'winter' and 'summer') showed a deviation from the normally parallel secretion of testicular steroids. In these pigs, testosterone increased while oestrone-sulphate remained low. In contrast to wild pigs, a photoperiod-induced seasonal pattern in prolactin secretion has not been demonstrated for domestic pigs. Although both experiments showed tendencies of higher prolactin concentrations during long days, the results of these studies are not conclusive. Together, the two studies show that photoperiod influences the timing of puberty in boars. Short days stimulate puberty and long days delay sexual maturation and reduce boar taint. However, the pre-weaning photoperiod can influence the response to the subsequent photoperiod. In mammals, seasonal changes in photoperiod are mediated through the pineal hormone melatonin. Melatonin secretion is typically high during the dark hours and negligible during the day, and thus reflects the period of darkness. In pigs, there have been considerable difficulties to demonstrate a typical melatonin profile, which has led to speculation that impaired melatonin production accounts for the lack of a seasonal breeding pattern in domestic pigs. Two assays for human melatonin were compared in plasma from pigs that had been exposed to either standard <b>stable</b> <b>lighting</b> or artificial short days or long days. According to conventional laboratory evaluating procedures both assays performed well, but only one assay measured a typical circadian plasma melatonin profile entrained by the photoperiod for all individuals. The measured increase in melatonin secretion during the dark phase was low compared with that in other species. However, the variation in melatonin levels between animals was high and there were indications of a genetic background to this. To investigate whether the pineal melatonin synthesis has been impaired by domestication, European wild boars of both sexes and domestic gilts were cannulated and sampled for 48 h in four seasons. A circadian melatonin profile entrained by the photoperiod of the season was observed in all animals and there was no difference was seen between wild and domestic pigs. To further study the great variation between animals in the increase of nocturnal melatonin, blood from 48 piglets and their parents was sampled during the day and night. Although the sampling method occasionally appeared to cause overestimated values, differences between litters in nocturnal melatonin concentrations strengthen the hypothesis that the observed variation between animals of nocturnal melatonin secretion in pigs is genetically based...|$|E
