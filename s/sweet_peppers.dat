5|$|Ottoman cuisine {{has given}} rise to the cuisines of modern Turkey, parts of the Balkans, Cyprus, and Greece. A {{distinctive}} element is the family of small flaky pastries called börek. These are popular and widespread across the Eastern Mediterranean region, and date as far back as ancient Roman times. Börek are made of thin sheets of filo pastry, filled with mixtures such as meat, caramelised onion and <b>sweet</b> <b>peppers.</b>|$|E
5|$|Spain's varied Mediterranean cuisines {{includes}} the cooking of Andalusia, Murcia, Catalonia, Valencia, and the Balearic islands. Paella is a characteristic Spanish dish, originally from Valencia, radiating {{early on to}} Catalonia and Murcia along Spain's Mediterranean coast. It comes in many versions, and may contain a mixture of chicken, pork, rabbit, or shellfish, sautéed in {{olive oil in a}} large shallow pan, with vegetables, and typically round-grain rice (often of the local albufera, arròs bomba, sénia varieties or similar) cooked to absorb the water and coloured with saffron. The dish may be varied with artichoke hearts, peas, <b>sweet</b> <b>peppers,</b> lima beans, string beans, or sausages.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to those in Italian Food, there are many Italian recipes and descriptions {{of the land and}} the people in David's other works. The first recipe in her first book, Mediterranean Food—soupe au Pistou—is of Genoese origin. Also in that book are recipes for bocconcini, osso bucco, and several Italian pasta and chicken dishes. Among the recipes in Summer Cooking is peperonata (pimentos or <b>sweet</b> <b>peppers</b> cooked with tomatoes in olive oil and butter) which was reprinted as the title article in a later selection from David's works. In An Omelette and a Glass of Wine, David printed Italian recipes including soups and omelettes made with hops (zuppa di lupolli and frittata con i loertis). Also in that book are substantial essays on Italian people and places. Is There a Nutmeg in the House? includes a six-page article on vegetable dishes from Mantua, and another of similar length on the variations of pizza in Italy and beyond.|$|E
40|$|AbstractLack of {{a strong}} and stable restorer-of-fertility (Rf) allele in <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> (Capsicum annuum L.) has been a hurdle in {{commercial}} exploitation of cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) system for cost-effective production of <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> hybrid seeds. A known sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker (CRF-S 870) associated with a fertility restoration phenotype (Rf locus) in hot pepper was validated in a strong restorer hot pepper inbred line (AVPP 9905). The CRF-S 870 marker was successfully used in marker-assisted backcrossing (MAB) to transfer Rf allele from hot pepper line AVPP 9905 to several <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> genotypes. The fertility restoration ability of 21 BC 4 F 2 <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> plants obtained through marker-assisted backcrossing {{was found to be}} normal, as CMS based plants derived from the backcrossed male plants upon selfing produced a normal amount of fruit with sufficient selfed seeds. The development of restorer lines in <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> is expected to open commercial exploitation of CMS hybrid technology in <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{was carried out in}} Northeastern Region of Brazil, in order to {{investigate}} the use of stingless bee Melipona subnitida Ducke in the pollination of greenhouse <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> (Capsicum annuum L.). Treatments of hand cross-pollination, hand self-pollination, pollination by bees and restricted pollination were performed. Results showed that despite <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> flowers are considered autogamous, this crop benefits from pollination by M. subnitida, producing fruits significantly heavier and wider, containing a greater number of seeds and of better quality (lower percentage of malformed fruits) than self-pollinated <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper.</b> Thus, M. subnitida can be considered an efficient pollinator of greenhouse <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper...</b>|$|R
40|$|Lygus rugulipennis Poppius and Liocoris tripustulatus Fabricius (Heteroptera: Miridae) are pests of {{glasshouse}} cucumber and <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> crops respectively. L. rugulipennis has a {{wide range}} of foodplants, but L. tripustulatus is specialised with very few food plants. We report behavioural assessments to investigate whether either species exhibits a preference for salad over wild hosts, and whether the role of olfaction and vision in response to cues from host plants can be distinguished. Olfactory responses to leaves were tested in choice chambers. L. rugulipennis was presented nettle (wild host) and a salad leaf of cucumber or <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper,</b> where the salad leaves had higher nitrogen content. L. tripustulatus was tested with nettle and <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> of two different nitrogen contents. Female L. rugulipennis spent more time on the cucumber salad host, and chose it first most often, but males showed no preference. Neither sex discriminated between <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> or nettle leaves, but males made more first contacts with <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper.</b> Neither sex of L. tripustulatus discriminated between <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> and nettle leaves when the <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> had higher nitrogen. When the plant species contained equivalent nitrogen both sexes spent more time on nettle. There was no difference in first choice made by either sex. When visual stimuli were available, and leaves had equivalent nitrogen, L. rugulipennis showed no preference and L. tripustulatus preferred nettle leaves. We conclude that the generalist L. rugulipennis has the ability to use remote olfactory cues for hos...|$|R

40|$|Greenhouse Work Simulation, GWorkS, is a {{model that}} simulates crop {{operations}} in greenhouses {{for the purpose of}} analysing work methods. GWorkS is a discrete event model that approaches reality as a discrete stochastic dynamic system. GWorkS was developed and validated using cut-rose as a case crop for which two cultivation systems exist, the path-based system and the mobile cultivation system. The focus of this paper is horizontal extension of GWorkS to <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper,</b> which is characterised by high crop-related labour effort and costs. For <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper,</b> international research aiming at automation of <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> harvest is ongoing. Dynamic process simulation and analysis may contribute strongly to economic and technical constraints for the design of new work methods. The most important crop operation in <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> cultivation, harvesting, was pre-modelled in IDEF 3 process analysis. The mathematical structure of the GWorkS model is described, as well as specific model adaptations for <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> and inputs determined from labour registration data and video recordings at a <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> grower. Data were analysed for two growers producing different pepper cultivars. Model simulations were performed for one grower. Dynamic simulation results were used to derive technical and economic requirements as numerical constraints for the design of work method innovation. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{conducted}} {{study was}} to determine to what extent the cultivation of <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> lowers the phytotoxicity of a substrate. The examined material was a highly phytotoxic substrate due to repeated cucumber growing on it. This substrate was a mixture of pine and beech bark, low peat and sawdust. Five <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> cultivars: Amador, Bell Boy, Culinar, Poznańska Słodka and WSE 2 / 82 were planted. During vegetation of the <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> phytotoxicity and phenolics levels were determined in the substrate.

Green mojo usually includes coriander, parsley, and garlic; whilst red mojo is piquant, and made from a mix of hot and <b>sweet</b> <b>peppers.</b> A wide variety of other ingredients are also used, including; almonds, cheese, saffron and fried bread. Mojos are served with most meat, and some fish, dishes, and are often used on potatoes, or bread is dipped into them.|$|E
2500|$|An Italian beef is a sandwich, {{originating}} in Chicago, composed of {{thin slices of}} seasoned roast beef, simmered and served au jus (known by locals as 'gravy') on a long Italian-style roll.

2500|$|A cheesesteak, or a Philly cheesesteak, is a long, crusty roll {{filled with}} thinly sliced sautéed ribeye beef and melted cheese. Generally, the cheese {{of choice is}} Cheez Whiz, but American and {{provolone}} are common substitutions. The art of cheesesteak preparation lies {{in the balance of}} flavors, textures and what {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "drip" [...] factor. Other toppings may include fried onions, sautéed mushrooms, ketchup and hot or <b>sweet</b> <b>peppers.</b> The cheesesteak was invented in 1930 by Philadelphian hot dog vendor Pat Olivieri who one day decided to substitute beef instead of a hot dog in a hoagie bun. A taxicab driver noticed the alluring aroma and asked for his own sandwich. Through word of mouth, Olivieri's sandwiches the following day were highly sought after by taxi cab drivers around Philadelphia. Due to booming business, Olivieri soon opened up his own shop, Pat's King of Steaks on 9th Street and Passyunk Avenue. Eventually, according to legend, he added cheese to the steak. The cheesesteak is considered to be a cultural icon of the city of Philadelphia.|$|E

40|$|There is an {{emerging}} {{body of literature}} analyzing how smallholder farmers in developing countries can benefit from modern supply chains. However, most of the available studies concentrate on export markets and fail to capture spillover effects that modern supply chains may have on local markets. Here, we analyze the case of <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> in Thailand, which was initially introduced as a product innovation in modern supply chains, but which is now widely traded also in more traditional markets. Using survey data from smallholder farmers and econometric techniques, we show that <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> cultivation contributes significantly to higher household incomes. Strikingly, at this stage, participation in modern supply chains {{does not lead to}} higher incomes than supplying <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> to traditional markets. However, the results also indicate that missing land titles, weak infrastructure conditions, and limited access to information constituted serious constraints during the early phases of <b>sweet</b> <b>pepper</b> adoption. Such constraints need to be overcome, so that smallholder farmers are better prepared for the prompt reactions needed under rapidly changing market conditions.
