Combined technical and scientific inquiry ensured experimental rigor in terms of the repeatable methods employed and reliable results achieved using an energy density (J/cm 2) approach. Outcomes of the study identified CO 2 laser-dye patterning as an innovative alternative textile coloration approach and dye on demand manufacturing process relevant to textile and clothing production.

They can be classified into two types, organic and inorganic ones. Most organic antibacterial agents are sensitive to temperature or pressure [11], while inorganic materials such as metal and metal oxide [12] have received more recognition over the past decade due to superior durability, less toxicity, greater selectivity, and heat resistance [13, 14]. TiO 2 and ZnO semiconductors have been extensively studied as antimicrobial agents due to their photocatalytic activity under UV light [15, 16].|$|R

50|$|New {{drainage}} systems incorporate geotextile filters that retain and prevent fine grains of soil from passing into and clogging the drain. Geotextiles are <b>synthetic</b> <b>textile</b> fabrics specially manufactured for civil and environmental engineering applications. Geotextiles {{are designed to}} retain fine soil particles while allowing water to pass through. In a typical drainage system they would be laid along a trench which would then be filled with coarse granular material: gravel, sea shells, stone or rock. The geotextile is then folded {{over the top of}} the stone and the trench is then covered by soil. Groundwater seeps through the geotextile and flow within the stone to an outfell. In high groundwater conditions a perforated plastic (PVC or PE) pipe is laid along the base of the drain to increases the volume of water transported in the drain.|$|E
50|$|Microfibers in {{textiles}} {{refer to}} sub-denier fiber (such as polyester drawn to 0.5 denier). Denier and Dtex are two measurements of fiber yield based on weight and length. If the fiber density is known, {{you also have}} a fiber diameter, otherwise it is simpler to measure diameters in micrometers. Microfibers in technical fibers refer to ultra fine fibers (glass or meltblown thermoplastics) often used in filtration. Newer fiber designs include extruding fiber that splits into multiple finer fibers. Most synthetic fibers are round in cross-section, but special designs can be hollow, oval, star-shaped or trilobal. The latter design provides more optically reflective properties. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>textile</b> fibers are often crimped to provide bulk in a woven, non woven or knitted structure. Fiber surfaces can also be dull or bright. Dull surfaces reflect more light while bright tends to transmit light and make the fiber more transparent.|$|E

Additionally, experiments with natural dyes were conducted and documented.

Each type of dye has benefits and disadvantages. Every system of dyeing produces waste along with the finished product.

50|$|Before <b>synthetic</b> <b>textiles</b> {{came into}} use, M. textilis {{was a major}} source of high quality fiber: soft, silky and fine. Ancestors of the modern abaca are thought to have {{originated}} from the Eastern Philippines where there are lot of rains (no pronounced dry season), in fact wild type of abaca can still be found in the interior forests of Catanduanes Island which is often not cultivated. Today, Catanduanes has many other modern kinds of abaca which are more competitive. For many years, breeders from various research institutions have made the cultivated varieties of Catanduanes Island even more competitive in local and international markets. This results in the optimum production of the island which had a consistent highest production throughout the archipelago.|$|R
