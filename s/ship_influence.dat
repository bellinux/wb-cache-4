40|$|We report {{properties}} of marine aerosol and clouds {{measured in the}} shipping lanes between Monterey Bay and San Francisco {{off the coast of}} Central California. Using a suite of aerosol instrumentation onboard the CIRPAS Twin Otter aircraft, these measurements represent a unique set of data contrasting the {{properties of}} clean and ship-impacted marine air masses in dry aerosol and cloud droplet residuals. Average mass and number concentrations of below-cloud aerosol of 2 &mu;g m&minus; 3 and 510 cm&minus; 3 are consistent with previous studies performed off the coast of California. Enhancement of vanadium and cloud droplet number concentration observed concurrently with a decrease in cloud water pH suggests that periods of high aerosol loading are primarily linked to increased <b>ship</b> <b>influence.</b> Mass spectra from a compact time-of-flight Aerodyne aerosol mass spectrometer reveal an enhancement in the fraction of organic at m/z 42 (f 42 ) and 99 (f 99 ) in ship-impacted clouds. These ions are well correlated to each other (R 2 > 0. 64) {{both in and out of}} cloud and dominate organic mass during periods of enhanced sulfate. High-resolution mass spectral analysis of these masses from ship measurements suggests that the ions responsible for this variation were oxidized, possibly due to cloud processing. We propose that the organic fractions of these ions be used as a metric for determining the extent to which ships impact the marine atmosphere where (f 42 > 0. 15; f 99 > 0. 04) would imply heavy influence from shipping emissions, (0. 05 f 42 f 99 f 42 f 99 < 0. 01) would imply clean, non-ship-influenced air...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the system design of an automatic ship landing {{system for a}} fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle UAV) intended to land in a net. It involves path planning, guidance and control, accurate navigation and ship motion prediction. Fully functional, the automatic landing system is intended to remove {{the need for a}} pilot when operating UAVs from a ship or other platforms with confined space. Dynamic flight paths for landing were developed using both piece-wise continuous interpolation (for simplicity) and Dubins path (for feasibility). The system uses the Pixhawk autopilot and a software toolchain from Underwater Systems and Technology Laboratory (LSTS), Porto, for vehicle control, mission review and communication. Either waypoints or climb rate and bank angle commands can be calculated in the LSTS toolchain and sent to Pixhawk. Real-Time Kinematic GPS (RTK-GPS) is used for accurate navigation. To ensure safe landing on a <b>ship</b> <b>influenced</b> by wind, waves and current, artificial neural network (ANN), an artificial intelligence (AI) method, is used for ship motion prediction. Software-in-the-loop (SIL) simulations demonstrated successful performance of the automatic landing system, where the UAV hit the landing target with reasonable accuracy. This was done by developing a decoupled guidance system to send climb rate and bank angle commands to the Pixhawk. Using simulated data from a <b>ship</b> <b>influenced</b> by waves and current, the ANN ship motion prediction system sufficiently performed predictions of heading and heave displacement for up to 60 seconds. A novel approach to ANN pre- and post-processing was found to increase heading prediction accuracy compared to conventional approaches, while ANN data fusion increased the performance and robustness of heave prediction compared to using a single data type...|$|R

We hypothesize that SHIP might control megakaryocytopoiesis through effects on proliferation of megakaryocyte progenitors (MKP) and megakaryocytes (MK). Methodology and Principal Findings: Herein, we report the megakaryocytic phenotype and MK functional assays of hematopoietic organs of two strains of SHIP deficient mice with deletion of the SHIP promoter/first exon or the inositol phosphatase domain. Both SHIP deficient strains exhibit a profound increase in MKP numbers in bone marrow (BM), spleen and blood as analyzed by flow cytometry (Lin 2 c-Kit + CD 41 +) and functional assays (CFU-MK). SHIP deficient MKP display increased phosphorylation of Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription 3 (STAT- 3), protein kinase B (PKB/AKT) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs). Despite increased MKP content, total body number of mature MK (Lin 2 c-kit 2 CD 41 +) are not significantly changed as SHIP deficient BM contains reduced MK while spleen MK numbers are increased. Reduction of CXCR- 4 expression in SHIP deficient MK may influence MK localization to the spleen instead of the BM. Endomitosis, process involved in MK maturation, was preserved in SHIP deficient MK.

Refractive conditions measured by the Marwin Rawinsonde Set (MRS) utilizing radiosondes launched from U. S. Navy ships can yield misleading modified refractivity (M) versus height profiles. MRS obtained M unit profiles, when incorporated in propagation loss models such as Radio Physical Optics (RPO), also may produce unrepresentative propagation loss assessments. Rocketsonde obtained environmental parameters (temperature, relative humidity, pressure) are measured away from the <b>ships</b> <b>influence.</b> The <b>ship</b> can modify the environmental parameters and affect temperatures {{by as much as}} 3 deg C. Rocketsonde obtained data yield improved fine scale vertical resolution. Resolution approaching 5 m obtained via rocketsondes is found to most closely resemble the actual environment. Rocketsonde data is available down to the near surface whereas there is a distinct lack of data from the surface to the launch point when utilizing balloon launched radiosondes. Inaccuracies in initial surface data drastically impact refractive profiles. Rocketsondes can be used regardless of sea state or wind conditions onboard ship and require no specific ship maneuvering to safely launch. It is found that the rocketsonde can obtain the requisite environmental parameters for refractive assessment on demand in less than half the time required to prepare and launch a balloon guided radiosonde.
