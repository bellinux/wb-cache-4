40|$|Incorporation of {{stearic acid}} into canola oil to produce trans-free {{structured}} lipid (SL) as a healthy alternative to partially hydrogenated fats for margarine formulation was investigated. Response surface methodology {{was used to}} {{study the effects of}} lipozyme RM IM from Rhizomucor miehei and Candida rugosa lipase isoform 1 (LIP 1) and two acyl donors, stearic acid and ethyl stearate, on the incorporation. Lipozyme RM IM and ethyl stearate gave the best result. Gram quantities of SLs were synthesized using lipozyme RM IM, and the products were compared to SL made by chemical catalysis and fat from commercial margarines. After <b>short-path</b> <b>distillation,</b> the products were characterized by GC and RPHPLC-MS to obtain fatty acid and triacylglycerol profiles, C- 13 NMR spectrometry for regiospecific analysis, X-ray diffraction for crystal forms, and DSC for melting profile. Stearic acid was incorporated into canola oil, mainly at the sn- 1, 3 positions, for the lipase reaction, and no new trans fatty acids formed. Most SL products did not have adequate solid fat content or beta' crystal forms for tub margarine, although these may be suitable for light margarine formulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{fatty acid}} {{specificity}} of four lipases towards eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was evaluated when performing ethanolysis of squid oil. During {{the first part}} of ethanolysis, no DHA ethyl esters were detected when using the lipases from Thermomyces lanuginosus, Pseudomonas cepacia or Pseudomonas fluorescens (in the case of the second and third lipases, no EPA ethyl esters were detected either). This indicates that these three lipases could not catalyse the conversion of DHA located in a triacylglycerol to ethyl ester, and that the Pseudomonas lipases could not catalyse the conversion of EPA either. This pattern was not found for the lipase from Rhizomucor miehei. The lipase from Thermomyces lanuginosus showed the lowest specificity towards DHA and the highest DHA recovery during DHA enrichment in the acylglycerol fraction. It was thus used to catalyse the ethanolysis of squid oil on a larger scale. The ethyl esters formed were removed using <b>short-path</b> <b>distillation,</b> resulting in a product containing mainly mono- and diacylglycerols. The product contained 34 mol-% DHA and 17 mol-% EPA, compared with 19 mol-% DHA and 12 mol-% EPA in the original squid oil...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to develop a process for the {{production}} of DAG from butterfat through glycerolysis and <b>short-path</b> <b>distillation</b> and to evaluate the physical properties of the DAG in comparison with the original butterfat. Chemical glycerolysis produced a mixture of acylglycerols containing DAG together with MAG and TAG. From the mixture of glycerolysis products, MAG were removed through three consecutive distillations (vacuum < 0. 001 mbar) at 150 °C. TAG were separated from DAG by distillation at 210 °C, which gave a product with more than 80 % DAG in the distillates. Distillation temperatures had significant effects on acyl migration. The formation of desirable 1, 3 -DAG was favored at higher temperatures. Under 210 °C distillation, the equilibrium ratio of 6 ∶ 4 was obtained between 1, 3 -DAG and 1, 2 (2, 3) -DAG. The FA profile of the DAG product was relatively similar to the original butterfat. The total DAG recovery was around 77 % in the pilot-scale production. The different patterns of m. p. were observed between butterfat and the DAG fraction produced as well as the MAG fraction collected. Solid fat content profiles of the DAG fraction and its mixtures with rapeseed oil possessed trends {{similar to those of the}} corresponding butterfat and its mixtures with rapeseed oil. Compared with butterfat, the DAG fraction behaved differently in its thermal profiles, crystallization patterns, and rheological properties; for example, the dropping point was 13 °C higher for the latter than for the former, and the crystal pattern was mostly β form for the latter, whereas the former was the β′ form. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Persistent organic {{pollutants}} (POPs) are fat soluble chemical substances that {{persist in the}} environment and bioaccumulate in the food chain. Through long-range environmental transportation by air, water and migratory species they are transferred to new locations distant from the source of release and might cause adverse effects to human health and to the environment. POPs comprise pesticides, industrial chemicals and unwanted by-products. The European Commission has implemented food and feed legislations concerning maximum permitted levels (MPLs) of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs), dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (DLPCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). Fish and consequently fishmeal and fish oil {{has been identified as}} one of the most important contributors to the level of dioxins and DL-PCBs in food and feed products. Fish caught in some of the North-European fishing areas contain high dioxin and PCB levels resulting in fishmeal and oil with WHO-PCDD/F-PCB-TEQ levels above the maximum permitted. To meet the new industrial and socialeconomic challenges there is a need for development of cost-effective decontamination technologies. Efficiency and limitations of alternative decontamination technologies to reduce the level of PCDD/Fs, DL-PCBs and polybrominated diphenyl ether flame retardants (PBDEs) in fishmeal (i. e., mechanical fat separation, organic solvent extraction and oil leaching) and fish oil (i. e., activated carbon (AC) adsorption and <b>short-path</b> <b>distillation</b> (SPD)) have been studied in this thesis. Factorial design experiments, response surface methodology and quantitative structure property relationships (QSPRs) have been utilized to model and optimize the fish oil decontamination alternatives. The trapping mechanisms for non- and mono-ortho PCBs on AC have been studied by use of molecular dynamics simulations. Optimization of the existing mechanical fat separation steps in the fishmeal process is expected to be the most cost-effective way to reduce the POPs content. However, the obtainable effects are limited (estimated to maximum 20 - 30 %) and have to be combined with organic solvent extraction if high decontamination rates are needed. The feasible use of a new oil leaching process has been studied and found to give effects comparable to hexane and isopropanol extraction of fishmeal (i. e., > 75 %). AC adsorption of PCDD/Fs is highly effective with obtainable WHO-TEQ-reduction of 99 %. Adsorption of DL-PCBs is less effective and dependent on orthosubstitution, i. e., non-ortho-PCBs are adsorbed more effectively than mono-ortho- PCBs, with maximum obtained levels of 87 % and 21 %, respectively. Compliance with present feed and food WHO-PCDD/F-PCB-TEQ legislations in fish oil can be achieved based on AC adsorption. The adsorption process had no effect on PBDEs. The selectivity can be explained based on dispersive electron interaction affected by sorbate planarity and steric effects and presence of electrostatic forces. Within each of the studied homologue groups, the volatility and reduction after SPD of the individual congeners is linearly dependent on the number of chlorine or bromine substitutions and ortho-substitution. The QSPRs were combined with process parameters to establish decontamination models for each homologue group of POPs. High decontamination efficiency (> 90 %) can be obtained by choice of favorable process conditions giving residual levels considerable below MPLs in feed and food. AC and SPD did not have any negative effects on fish oil oxidation level. Oxidative stability of the oil after SPD was affected both negative and positive depending on processing conditions. SPD did not affect the level of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) nor induce geometrical isomerization. Some co-evaporation and loss of vitamins, cholesterol and unsaponifiables can not be avoided during SPD. The retention level will depend on the applied process conditions and the concentration ratio and difference in vapor pressure between free and ester forms of the respective compounds. A high retention level (> 80 %) of volatile nutrients after SPD could be obtained by choice of process conditions giving residual WHO-TEQ-levels in accordance with present feed and food legislations and the voluntary industrial monograph of GOED...|$|E
