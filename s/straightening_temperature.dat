40|$|Abstract. Hot {{ductility}} of HRB 500 E vanadium-containing {{steel rebar}} was study with thermal simulation {{test and the}} secondary cooling model was established based {{on the relationship between}} the cooling water and the casting speed. The solidification cooling curves and the temperature fields of HRB 500 E were simulated with the PROCAST software. The result of the hot ductility and the pin shooting experiment shows that the casting <b>straightening</b> <b>temperature</b> should be above 902 ˚C and the secondary cooling model was feasible and accurate. Finally the high-quality billet of HRB 500 E was obtained...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The hot {{ductility}} {{behavior of}} test steel was investigated by Gleeble- 3500 thermo-mechanical simulator through high temperature tensile test. The reduction in area(RA) and tensile strength(TS) were acquired to draw hot ductility curve and hot strength curve. SEM fractograph and microstructure of the tensile samples were analyzed. The {{results show that}} the third brittle zone of test steel is between 700 o C and 800 o C and the occurrence of the third brittle zone is mainly related to the formation of film-like ferrite along the prior austenite grain boundary and the precipitation of second phase. Moreover, the drop of hot ductility at 900 o C is rooted in the reduction of grain boundary strength owing to the precipitation of sulfides. Therefore, it is advised that the <b>straightening</b> <b>temperature</b> of test steel should be kept over 900 o C...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{the process}} of the {{continuous}} straightening during continuous casting, elevated temperature creep and stress relaxation are remarkable. During continuous <b>straightening,</b> <b>temperature</b> of steel billet is very high, where the characteristic of deformation is low strain and low strain rate. Experiments of elevated temperature creep, stress relaxation and elevated tension under the conditions of continuous straightening were carried on Gleeble 3500 thermal-mechanical simulation machine and the results indicate that both the creep speed and the stress relaxation speed are very fast in the conditions of continuous straightening. Then metallurgical structures were observed. A lead plate was used to simulate the billet during continuous straightening and then straightening forces were measured. An elasto-viscoplastic model and an elasto-plastic model were built according to the experiment to calculate the straightening forces. The contrast between the calculation results and the measured data shows that ignoring the creep and stress relaxation will result in great errors when calculating the straightening forces in continuous straightening. Carrying researches on elevated temperature creep and stress relaxation and using their characteristics in design has great importance to improve {{the quality and quantity of}} billets in {{the process of}} continuous casting...|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} review of prior heat straightening research indicated that significant {{research has been}} conducted on the development of: (i) heat straightening repair techniques and their field implementation, (ii) guidelines and recommendations for heat straightening repair, (iii) empirical procedures for estimating plastic rotations achieved during heat straightening, (iv) empirical procedures for predicting residual stresses caused by heat straightening, and (v) the effects of heat straightening on the structural properties of repaired bridges. Currently, {{there is a need for}} additional research on: (a) the fatigue performance of heat straightened beams, (ii) the effects of single and multiple heat straightening on the fracture toughness and microstructure of steel beams, (iii) the development of guidelines for evaluating and replacing steel beams subjected to single or multiple damage-repairs, and (iv) investigating the effects of realistic heat straightening with imperfections on the properties and serviceability of steel beam bridges. The {{literature review}} of existing heat treatments indicates that heat <b>straightening</b> with maximum <b>temperature</b> limited to 1200 °F is relatively similar to the process annealing heat treatment. Heat <b>straightening</b> with maximum <b>temperature</b> limited to 1400 oF is similar to the normalizing annealing heat treatment. Both these heat treatments repair plastically deformed microstructure by the phenomenon known as recovery and recrystallization. Normalizing annealing is more efficient and faster than process annealing in repairing the plastically deformed microstructure by recrystallization. Heat treatment and repair of the material microstructure is incidental to the heat straightening repair process. The heat straightened beam can be further heat treated to complete the repair of the material microstructure (recrystallization etc.). The practical and economic feasibility of additional heat treatment using electrically powered and controlled radiant heaters was evaluated and found to be reasonable...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The hot {{ductility}} investigations under {{strain rate}} 0. 01 /s were {{shown in this}} work [...] The investigations were carried out on the low carbon-manganese steel 1008 with addition of boron. Design/methodology/approach: The ductility of the steel was measured by reduction of area of fraction after the extension test in the temperature range from 700 °C to 1200 °C. The test was carried out with strain rates 0. 01 /s, which is characteristic for the continuous casting process. Samples of examined steel were divided to two origin regions of COS slab: columnar grains and equiaxial grains. The microstructures analysis were carried out on samples sectioned with tensile direction at fracture. The straightness of 1008 steel was also observed. Findings: The received 40 % and 23 % ductility minimums of investigated steel for columnar and equiaxial grains respectively {{were found in the}} temperature range 800 - 950 °C. These temperatures are connected with band straightening in the continues casting process. The ferrite-bainite and ferrite-pearlite microstructures after air cooling were observed. The straightness of investigated steel decreases with rising temperature. Research limitations/implications: Practical implications: The temperature of hot ductility minimum of investigated low carbon steel with addition of boron corresponds with <b>straightening</b> <b>temperature</b> of the strand, which is taken place close to 900 °C during continuous casting process. Originality/value: Available literature concerns investigations of low carbon steels but without boron addition, which expect to have strong influence on the position of the hot ductility minimu...|$|E
