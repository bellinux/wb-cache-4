30|$|A {{series of}} pile load tests {{were carried out}} on model scale piles {{including}} precast concrete, closed-end <b>steel</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>pile</b> and open-ended <b>steel</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>pile</b> driven into a marine sensitive clay in Gloucester, ON, Canada. The measurements include tensile load tests which were performed on all three model piles immediately after driving and repeatedly at elapsed times 1, 3, 7, 14, and 30  days after initial driving. The shaft capacity of all three piles initially was at about 945 – 990  N. For the pile load tests conducted 14  days after the initial driving, the load carrying capacity for all three piles increased approximately 4.5 – 5.5 times in average from their initial capacity. The lowest and highest set-up values (30  days after driving) were {{in the range of}} 4 – 6 times for the open-ended steel pile and precast concrete pile, respectively. The rate of increase in pile capacity was significant in the first couple of days from the initial pile driving. This rate was ultimately decreased as the elapsed time increased up to 30  days. These changes could be due to quick dissipation of excess pore water pressure and possibly greater rate of consolidation of the soil in earlier periods. However, when the change in the rate of set-up is very slow, this is correlated to the aging phase (secondary compression), since the effective stress-related set-up is adequately complete and, hence, the rate of set-up is independent of effective stress during this phase.|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} decades, the {{behavior}} of pile foundations in liquefiable sands has been studied extensively; however, similar investigations of soft clays or static/seismic response of piles in improved soft clay soils are scarce. Despite the widespread presence of this soil type in high seismic regions and the frequent need to locate bridges and buildings in soft clay, only a few investigations {{have been carried out}} to guide engineers in evaluating the effectiveness of ground improvement techniques on increasing the lateral resistance of pile foundation embedded in soft clay, and no numerical models have been validated to evaluate this approach. Thus, the objective of this research was to develop modified p-y curves for Winkler analysis to characterize the lateral load behavior of a single pile embedded in a volume of improved clay surrounded by unimproved soft clays. A detailed literature review was completed in the study, aiming to gain knowledge on the development and fields of applications together with limitations of different ground improvement techniques. The ability of each available analysis method for lateral loaded piles was assessed for determining lateral responses of pile foundation in a volume of improved soil surrounded by unimproved soil. A method of developing p-y curve modification factors to account for the effect of the improved soil on enhancing the lateral load behavior of a single pile embedded in soft clay was developed by integrating the effectiveness of the improved soil into the procedures of constructing p-y curves for stiff clay recommended by Welch and Reese (1972). It was achieved by estimating the effective length for a infinitely long soil layer with soil improvement so that the fraction of the load resisted by the soil improved over a limited horizontal extent could be accounted for by taking the ratio between the soil resistance attenuation at actual length of the soil improvement and the effective length. The accuracy of the method was verified against the centrifuge test data from Liu et al. (2010) and the full scale field test from Fleming et al. (2010). The verifications using experimental data demonstrated that the Winkler analysis with proposed p-y modification factors is able to capture the full range of elastic and inelastic pile responses with slopes that correspond well with the results obtained from both centrifuge and field testing, the effectiveness of the soil improvement can be adequately evaluated. In addition, an analytical study on the effectiveness of the cement-deep-soil-mixing (CDSM) ground improvement technique on controlling the lateral displacement of pile foundations embedded in different clay soil conditions with and without ground improvement was carried out. A set of lateral load analyses was performed to establish permissible displacements for precast, prestressed concrete piles as well as open-ended <b>steel</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>pile</b> prior to reaching the curvature capacity of piles.

40|$|Ground-source {{heat pump}} (GSHP) systems can achieve a higher {{coefficient}} of performance than conventional air-source heat pump (ASHP) systems because the ground, which functions as the heat source or sink, is at a higher temperature in winter and lower in summer than the air temperature (Kavanaugh 1992; Kavanaugh et al 1997). In addition, there will likely be some mitigation against {{the effects of the}} heat island phenomena, as this system does not emit exhaust heat into the atmosphere during air conditioning. However, GSHP systems are not popular except as experimental versions in Japan. This is primarily due to the high cost of boring to run piping underground. For example, such boring costs average about ¥ 3, 000 /m (approx. US$ 30 /m) in the USA, whereas the same work is about ¥ 10, 000 /m (US$ 100 /m) in Japan. Thus, even if the heat pump performance in GSHP systems is more effective than that of the more common ASHP systems, the GSHP systems are unable to recoup the initial piping costs within their lifecycles.

The analysisprocedure makes full use of the theory of one-dimensional elastic wave-propagation,and is specifically based on the two-point strain-gauge method. Close examination isfirst made of all the strain waveforms available for a single blow of the hammer atthe final stage of pile penetration into the thin layer of dense sand. The analysisclearly shows that the propagation of the strain waves obey the theory of elasticwave-propagation, along with the wave velocity of 5200 m being identified. Theanalysis also shows that the sharp decay in the peak amplitude of the strain wave-forms observed in the lower 4 meters of the pile is due to the reflection of the pre-cursing waves at the pile tip as the tension waves. The two-point strain-gaugemethod is then applied to predicting the displacement of the pile head as a functionof time during a single blow of the hammer, and the results are shown to comparefavourably with what was measured on the site using a manually tracing technique. Furthermore, the application of the two-point strain-gauge method reveals the realefficiency of driving to be as low as 0. 22, compared with the commonly assumedvalue of 0. 5.

30|$|The {{phenomenon}} is well-known, but {{little is known}} about the mechanism of soil plug formation inside pipe piles, especially for the sleeve driven by vibratory hammers. The formation of a soil plug depends upon a number of factors, e.g. installation method, pile diameter, penetration depth, soil density, whereas the investigation on the influencing factors are still not complete. A lot of researches were conducted to evaluate the soil plugging effect during pipe pile driving. Based on the principle of static equilibrium, Randolph et al. (1991) developed the concept of active height of soil plug and established the one-dimensional static equilibrium equation. Holeyman et al. (2013) presented another analytic expression of the shaft resistance of vibratory driven pile taking account of the soil damping. The limitation of the 1  g model test (O’Neill and Raines 1991) is the same with that of the soil samples under low stress, therefore, the ideal stress condition required by the investigation of the soil plug can be achieved by the use of the geotechnical centrifuge. Nicola and Randolph (1997) analyzed the behavior of soil plug during pipe pile driving by model tests. It was found that the height of soil plug decreased with the increase in the relative compactness of the sands during pile jacking, but increased with the relative compactness of the sands during impact pile driving. Experimental studies of Xing et al. (2012) indicated that the height of soil plug inside impact-driven pipe pile increased as the pipe wall thickness decreased. The distribution of the shaft resistance was nonlinear along the pile length, and depended on the impact force and soil conditions. Tan and Lin (2013) found that the soil plug developed from partially plugged mode in the upper soft cohesive soils into fully plugged mode in the underlying medium dense to dense cohesionless soil layers, and the external shaft resistance was about two-thirds of shaft resistance through a series of <b>steel</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>pile</b> static penetration tests. Liyanapathirana et al.

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to prove the characteristics of swelling pressure of water-swelling materials which are applied to joint sealing materials, e. g., a <b>steel</b> (<b>pipe)</b> sheet <b>pile,</b> etc., and to experimentally evaluate the swelling pressure of water-swelling materials. The results we obtained are : (1) the swelling pressure depends on the membrane thickness of the water-swelling materials. The thicker a membrane becomes, the bigger the pressure tends to be. (2) While the swelling pressure is not much influenced by the temperature of the water to be immersed, it is influenced by the quality of water to be immersed. Similar to the traits of the swelling rate, the swelling pressure when immersed in artificial sea water is lower compared with that when immersed in freshwater. (3) For example, water-swelling materials 1 mm thick achieve a swelling pressure of 6. 7 MPa when immersed in fresh water, and 4. 2 MPa when immersed in artificial sea water, respectively. Accordingly, we assume they should fully perform the swelling functions under a restricted environment as well...|$|R
40|$|Noto Peninsula {{earthquake}} {{of magnitude}} 6. 7 occurred near Noto Peninsula in Japan on March 25 2007. Notojima Bridge across Nanao Bay which {{was completed in}} 1982 is located about 30 km east-southeast of the epicenter. It is 1050 m long multi-span bridge consisting of 21 spans in which the 10 and 8 spans are simply supported PC girder bridges and the central three spans are a rigid frame PC bridge with pin-connection at the mid-span. Notojima Bridge sustained considerable damage in many RC piers bearing supports and expansion joints. Especially the piers of P 10 and P 13 in the central portion of the bridge sustained damage asymmetrically {{in spite of the}} symmetrical figure of the superstructure and piers. In order to verify unexpected damage the central portion is investigated based on seismic response analysis taking account of the inelastic hysteretic property of piers and the strong-motion data observed near the bridge. It is found that the difference of <b>steel</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>piles</b> between P 10 and P 13 might affect the asymmetrical damage...|$|R

The pile-soil interface behavior {{is of particular interest}} in sands where shaft friction {{plays an important role in}} resisting the applied load. The rational design of the shaft capacity depends on a good understanding of the mechanisms of interface friction during pile installation and static loading. There are two new methods on the basis of the cone penetration test results that take into account the effect of friction fatigue arising from pile installation. An improvement is made in this study to account for the influence of plugging degree, which is a key issue for open-ended piles. The significance of the modified design framework lies in that it allows for the role of plugging in a more rational way by using the soil-squeezing ratio that is closely related to the radial effective stress and, consequently, the shaft capacity. The performance of the improved method is assessed against the existing methods in terms of evaluating the shaft resistance of two full-scale offshore bridge piles. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
