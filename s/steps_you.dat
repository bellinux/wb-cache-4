2500|$|On October 22, 2003, {{during his}} one-day shift as Acting Mayor, while Mayor Willie Brown {{traveled}} to Tibet, Daly appointed two {{members to the}} San Francisco Public Utilities Commission without Brown's consent, having consulted with the City Attorney who had advised him that as acting mayor he had the legal authority to make appointments in Mayor Brown's absence. [...] Brown, who had his own people in mind for the assignments, had a different opinion, stating that [...] " [...] were made by {{a person who was}} supposed to be operating in a ceremonial capacity... a conspiracy to... move away from the traditions, the rules, the customs and the conduct that has been the hallmark of this city, long before I became mayor of this city." [...] Brown also compared Daly to a stalker and suicide bomber, stating that, [...] "When you conspire and calculate what you intend to do several days before you're designated as the acting mayor, you really are venal, you really are violative of all the protocols. It's like stalking. You knew exactly what you were intending to do. You concealed all your <b>steps.</b> <b>You</b> carefully plotted, then you did it behind closed doors, and then you laughed about it." [...] Brown said he found out about Daly's actions when his chief of staff called him in Tibet. Brown was sleeping at the time but with the assistance of Chinese officials, was on a plane home within hours, cutting short his trade and promotion trip to China—reportedly explaining the matter to his hosts simply as a [...] "coup." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Certainly the {{incident}} was unusual. What were your next <b>steps?</b> <b>You</b> examined the room, I presume, {{to see if the}} intruder had left any traces--any cigar-end or dropped glove or hairpin or other trifle?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{great deal}} too short, Mr. King," [...] the {{lieutenant}} said. [...] "We {{want to know}} what <b>steps</b> <b>you</b> took, and how you managed it. Did you come down all the way by train?" ...|$|E
