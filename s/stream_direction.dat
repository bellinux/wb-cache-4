The simulation show that the counterstreaming instability changes its character from magnetic to electrostatic nature. The electrostatic waves growing due to the electrostatic counterstreaming instability play an important role for producing fast electrons and positrons with energy of MeV.

5000|$|Its {{efficiency}} {{is lower than}} that of a turbine with constant air <b>stream</b> <b>direction</b> and asymmetric airfoil. One reason for the lower {{efficiency is}} that symmetric airfoils have a higher drag coefficient than asymmetric ones, even under optimal conditions. Also, in the Wells turbine, the symmetric airfoil runs partly under high angle of attack (i.e., low blade speed / air speed ratio), which occurs during the air velocity maxima of the oscillating flow. A high angle of attack causes a condition known as [...] "stall" [...] in which the airfoil loses lift. The efficiency of the Wells turbine in oscillating flow reaches values between 0.4 and 0.7.|$|E

Oblique, quasiperpendicular modes grow almost as fast, as the growth rate varies only moderately with angle, and they may distort or corrugate the filaments after the perpendicular mode saturates.

40|$|Studies {{have been}} made to obtain the average speed and the flowing {{direction}} of oceanic currents or their general conditions from the distance and time of the drift of the long-line set in the sea. The authors studied the influence of the known direction and speed of oceanic currents on the style of the long-line in a horizontal direction between the time it is streamed down and the time it is hauled up. The present research was {{made on the basis of}} the data collected in the Indian Ocean during the three years from 1967 to 1969. But as the survey was made in the same season every year, the direction of the oceanic currents and that of the monsoon were found to show the same trend at the time of survey. This fact made it impossible to examine the currents in all <b>directions</b> against the <b>streaming</b> <b>direction</b> of the long-line. It was attempted to obtain the variation of the style of streamed tuna longline by the force of the currents from the direction in the third quadrant against the <b>streaming</b> <b>direction</b> of the long-line. When the direction of the long-line at its streaming time was placed on the Y axis, and the variation of the style of the long-line between the time of its setting and the time of its taking in on the X axis, a formula Y=- 1. 59 X was obtained. ﻿マグロ延縄の投縄方向に対し海流を第 3 象限より受ける場合,投縄時の縄成りと揚縄時の縄成り変化傾向を求めた. 投縄時の縄成りをY軸に投縄時の縄成りに対する揚縄時の縄成り変化をX軸にとるとY=- 1. 59 Xを得た...|$|R
50|$|In unicast routing, each router {{examines}} the destination address of an incoming packet {{and looks up}} the destination in a table to determine which interface to use in order for that packet {{to get closer to}} its destination. The source address is irrelevant to the router. However, in multicast routing, the source address (which is a simple unicast address) is used to determine data <b>stream</b> <b>direction.</b> The source of the multicast traffic is considered upstream. The router determines which downstream interfaces are destinations for this multicast group (the destination address), and sends the packet out through the appropriate interfaces. The term reverse path forwarding is used to describe this concept of routing packets away from the source, rather than towards the destination.|$|E
50|$|This {{supports}} {{what was}} written by trombonist and brass pedagogue Donald S. Reinhardt in 1942. In 1972, Reinhardt described and labeled different embouchure patterns according to such characteristics as mouthpiece placement and {{the general direction of}} the air stream as it travels past the lips. According to this later text, players who place the mouthpiece higher on the lips, so that more upper lip is inside the mouthpiece, will direct the air downwards to varying degrees while playing. Performers who place the mouthpiece lower, so that more lower lip is inside the mouthpiece, will direct the air to varying degrees in an upward manner. In order for the performer to be successful, the air <b>stream</b> <b>direction</b> and mouthpiece placement need to be personalized based on individual anatomical differences. Lloyd Leno confirmed the existence of both upstream and downstream embouchures.|$|E
5000|$|According to Farkas the {{mouthpiece}} should have [...] upper lip and [...] lower lip (French horn), [...] lower lip and [...] upper lip (trumpet and cornet), and more latitude for lower brass (trombone, baritone, and tuba). For trumpet, some also advocate [...] upper lip and [...] lower lip. Farkas claimed placement {{was more important}} for the instruments with smaller mouthpieces. The lips should not overlap each other, nor should they roll in or out. The mouth corners should be held firm. Farkas speculated that the horn should be held in a downward angle to allow the air stream to go straight into {{the mouthpiece}}, although his later text shows that air <b>stream</b> <b>direction</b> actually is either upstream or downstream and is dependent upon the ratio of upper or lower lip inside the mouthpiece, not the horn angle. Farkas advised to moisten the outside of the lips, then form the embouchure and gently place the mouthpiece on it. He also recommended there must be a gap of 1/3 in or so between the teeth so that the air flows freely.|$|E

Comparisons with observational data are given, and the results indicate {{the existence of a}} daily non-field-aligned anisotropy about one fourth as large as the field-aligned anisotropy.
