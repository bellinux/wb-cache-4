40|$|Electron {{microscopy}} {{has described}} the salivary pellicle as an 'uneven, knotted structure'. This study describes a novel soft-layer model of salivary pellicles, based on measured electrophoretic mobilities {{and the influence of}} dentifrices and a chlorhexidine mouthwash on the parameters of the model. The enamel surface was found to possess a high number of fixed, negative charges (zN = - 62 mM) and to be electrophoretically hard (1 /lambda = 0. 6 nm), i. e. impenetrable to fluid flow. Adsorption of a salivary pellicle resulted in a fourfold reduction in the surface fixed charge density (zN = - 15 mM) along with an increase in electrophoretic softness (1 /lambda = 2. 3 nm). Exposure of pellicles to various dentifrices containing sodium fluoride as an active component and sodium lauryl sulfate as a detergent had little effect on the surface fixed charge densities (varying between - 15 and - 30 mM, depending on the dentifrice involved) and electrophoretic softnesses (varying between 2. 3 and 3. 4 nm). Exposure of pellicles to a dentifrice containing <b>sodium</b> fluoride and <b>hexametaphosphate</b> as an additional detergent yielded soft (8. 0 nm) pellicles, penetrable to fluid flow, with few fixed, negative charges (1 mM). This is opposite to the effects of chlorhexidine, which created an electrophoretically hard pellicle (1. 7 nm). This soft-layer electro-kinetic model quantitatively shows that the degree to which pellicles are penetrable to fluid flow differs upon exposure to dentifrices, with relevance for plaque formation, de- and remineralization and staining processes.
