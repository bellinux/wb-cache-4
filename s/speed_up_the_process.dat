5|$|After the {{formation}} of the Fox-North Coalition, Mansfield agreed to act as Speaker of the House of Lords, taking up his post in February 1783. The main item of debate during the Coalition Ministry was the East India Bill, which provoked bitter arguments in both the House of Lords and House of Commons. In an attempt to <b>speed</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of passing the bill, Mansfield left his position as Speaker to debate directly on 15 December; when this failed to help he returned to the Woolsack the next day. The failure of the bill caused the government to be immediately dismissed, and Mansfield left his position on 23 December 1783.|$|E

5|$|Almost all antbirds lay two eggs. A few {{species of}} antshrike lay three eggs, {{and a smaller}} number of antbirds lay one egg, but this is unusual. Small clutch sizes are typical of {{tropical}} birds compared to more temperate species of the same size, possibly due to nest predation, although this is disputed. Both parents participate in incubation, although only the female incubates at night. The length of time taken for chicks to hatch is 14–16 days in most species, although some, such as the dusky antbird, can take as long as 20 days. The altricial chicks are born naked and blind. Both parents brood the young until they are able to thermoregulate, although, as with incubation, only the female broods at night. In common with many songbirds, the parents take faecal sacs for disposal away from the nest. Both parents feed the chicks, often bringing large prey items. When the chicks reach fledging age, after 8–15 days, attending parents call their chicks. As each chick leaves the nest it is cared for exclusively from then on by the parent that was present then. After the first chick fledges and leaves with a parent the remaining parent may increase the supply of food to <b>speed</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of fledging. After fledging, chicks spend the first few days well hidden as the parents bring them food. Chicks of some species may not become independent of the parents for as long as four months in some antwrens, but two months is more typical {{for the rest of the}} family.|$|E

The earliest known script, Sumerian cuneiform, includes many cases of character combinations that, over time, gradually evolve from ligatures into separately recognizable characters. Ligatures figure prominently in many historical manuscripts, notably the Brahmic abugidas, or the bind rune of the Migration Period Germanic runic inscriptions.|$|E

25|$|The chief {{reason why}} people with {{diabetes}} develop high blood pressure is hardening of the arteries. Diabetes tends to <b>speed</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of atherosclerosis. The other fact about diabetes is that it affects {{both large and small}} blood vessels in the body. Over time, blood vessels become clogged with fatty depots, become non-compliant and lose their elasticity. The process of atherosclerosis is a lot faster in diabetic individuals whom do not have good control of their blood sugars. The high blood pressure eventually leads to heart failure, strokes, heart attacks, blindness, kidney failure, loss of libido and poor circulation of blood in the legs. When the blood supply to the feet is compromised, the chances of infections and amputations also increases. All diabetics should know that even mild elevations in blood pressure can be detrimental to health. Studies have shown that diabetics with even a slight elevation in blood pressure have 2-3 times {{the risk of heart disease}} compared to individuals without diabetes.|$|E

25|$|Spiders are {{notified}} {{that potential}} prey {{has been caught}} in the web through vibrations along strands, these can be followed to the prey location on the web and be used to estimate prey size. Due to the large variety in prey Nephila has different attack techniques dependent on prey size. Small prey like flies are captured alive then removed from the web and wrapped in silk. This occurs with smaller prey because they do not present a threat to the spider when alive. Prey that is seen as potentially threatening will be bitten to be subdued before wrapping. Medium-sized prey will receive bites that are sustained until prey is immobilised and then be covered in silk. Finally, the largest captured prey receive the –bite and back off– treatment where a single lunging bite is made before the spider withdraws and waits for the venom to take effect before wrapping. This lunging bite is often repeated to <b>speed</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of immobilisation.|$|E
