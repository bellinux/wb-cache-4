5|$|While the Commission is the {{executive}} branch, the candidates are chosen individually by the 28 national governments, which means {{it is not possible}} for a Commission Member or its President to be removed by a direct election. Rather, the legitimacy of the Commission is mainly drawn from the vote of approval that is required from the European Parliament, along with Parliament's power to dismiss the body, which, in turn, raises the concern of the relatively low turnout (less than 50%) in elections for the European Parliament since 1999. While that figure may be higher than that of some national elections, including the off-year elections of the United States Congress, {{the fact that there are}} no elections for the position of Commission President calls the position's legitimacy into question in the eyes of some. The fact that the Commission can directly decide (albeit with oversight from <b>specially</b> <b>formed</b> 'comitology committees') on the shape and character of implementing legislation further raises concerns about democratic legitimacy.|$|E

25|$|In 1912, it was {{suggested}} that a <b>specially</b> <b>formed</b> company should take over from the Surplus Lands Committee and develop suburban estates near the railway. However, World War I delayed these plans and it was only in 1919, with expectation of a postwar housing boom, that Metropolitan Railway Country Estates Limited (MRCE) was formed. MRCE went on to develop estates at Kingsbury Garden Village near Neasden, Wembley Park, Cecil Park and Grange Estate at Pinner and the Cedars Estate at Rickmansworth and create places such as Harrow Garden Village.|$|E

Drinking continued meanwhile, thanks to hotels and liquor merchants in outlying districts, huge volumes of beer, often in kegs, brought to private homes, or {{sold by the}} glass by keggers at hiding spots round the City. When prohibition ended, a committee of citizens persuaded the Government to give the monopoly on liquor sales in Invercargill to the <b>specially</b> <b>formed</b> Invercargill Licensing Trust.

25|$|Russell had {{obtained}} a loan from Aaron the Jew of Lincoln (died 1186), {{the greatest of}} the Jewish financiers licensed to trade in England, and on the seizure of Jewish assets by King Henry II (1154–1189) in 1186 his debt became due to the crown. It appears the Treasury was content {{for a while to}} leave these debts uncollected, but the position changed following King John's peace treaty with King Philip II of France (1180–1223) signed in May 1200, which required the English king to pay Philip the sum of 20,000 marks. Thereupon John levied a carucage tax on the kingdom and adopted a more active policy towards collection of Aaron's debts, then dealt with on account of their magnitude by a separate <b>specially</b> <b>formed</b> Exchequer of the Jews. In 1200 John Russell rendered his account for his debt to Aaron of £12 14s 8d and paid into the Exchequer on account the sum of 20s (i.e., £1). For the balance he was given respite by royal writ until 1207/8 when he rendered his account for £5 12s 8d and paid 6 marks into the Treasury.

Besides, we constructed a fisher discrimination functions based on the classification for the extensibility and inheritability of the regime classification, and deduced the classification for 2009. The classification cast new light that in past thirty years the effective exchange rate in all regimes has become more stable over time. The classification coding also proves that: 1) Nominal bilateral and effective exchange rates have increasing trend as well as inflation form pegging to floating; 2) Comparing to developing countries, the behavior of developed countries’ effective exchange rate is more stable; 3) With the development of globalization, more and more developing countries choose to peg their major trade partners’ currency, which {{was reflected in the}} behavior of effective exchange rate.

6000|$|Concluding Remarks.--The males {{from the}} absence of a mouth (and no doubt of a stomach), must {{necessarily}} be short-lived, and, I suppose, are periodically replaced by fresh males.[57] In one instance, the remnants of the two great compound eyes of the larva, could be seen {{at the end of the}} pouch, opposite the orifice. The larvæ, I conclude, crawl in at the orifice, one side of which is formed, as we have seen, of yielding membrane, and scratch out the dead exuviæ of the former occupant: certainly, the males are less firmly attached to their pouches, though some small quantity of cement is excreted, than are other Cirripedes to the objects to which they are attached. The small size of the female, and her valves not being thickly edged with chitine, accounts for the males having pouches <b>specially</b> <b>formed</b> for them, instead of being, as in S. vulgare, laterally imbedded in the chitine-border of the scuta. In hereafter weighing the evidence on the nature of the parasites in Ibla and in Scalpellum, the fact of the valves of the supposed female being here modified for the special purpose of lodging the males, will be seen to be important. If we imagine the male parasites to be extraneous animals, and that by adhering to the sack of the Scalpellum, they injure the corium and thus prevent the growth of the shell over an area exactly corresponding to their own size, and so form for themselves cavities; yet what can be said regarding the preparatory furrows? surely these narrow lines cannot have been produced by the pressure of the much broader parasites. Must we not see in the furrows, the first marking out, if such an expression may be used, of the habitation for the male, which has to be <b>specially</b> <b>formed</b> by the independent laws of growth of the female? ...|$|E
