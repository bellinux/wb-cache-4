5|$|Like {{many species}} of spider, a P. schultzi lays a {{continuous}} dragline of silk as it moves, {{and from time to}} time anchors the dragline to a <b>surface</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> spot of sticky silk. This allows the spider to return to the surface if the animal is dislodged. A spider about to jump first lays a sticky silk anchor, and then lays out a dragline as it flies. Unlike those of most jumping spiders, P. schultzi′s draglines stick to each other and, when a P. schultzi has laid a few lines across a gap, it uses these as walkways and reinforces them with additional silk as it moves.|$|E
5|$|Ganymede's surface has an albedo {{of about}} 43%. Water ice {{seems to be}} {{ubiquitous}} on its <b>surface,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mass fraction of 50–90 %, significantly more than in Ganymede as a whole. Near-infrared spectroscopy has revealed the presence of strong water ice absorption bands at wavelengths of 1.04, 1.25, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 μm. The grooved terrain is brighter and has a more icy composition than the dark terrain. The analysis of high-resolution, near-infrared and UV spectra obtained by the Galileo spacecraft and from Earth observations has revealed various non-water materials: carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and, possibly, cyanogen, hydrogen sulfate and various organic compounds. Galileo results have also shown magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) and, possibly, sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) on Ganymede's surface. These salts may originate from the subsurface ocean.|$|E
5|$|It has {{a smooth}} and bright <b>surface,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> layer of water {{surrounding}} {{the mantle of}} the planet, thought to be 100 kilometers thick. The smooth surface includes a layer of ice, while {{the bottom of the}} ice is theorized to be liquid water. The apparent youth and smoothness of the surface have led to the hypothesis that a water ocean exists beneath it, which could conceivably serve as an abode for extraterrestrial life. Heat energy from tidal flexing ensures that the ocean remains liquid and drives geological activity. Life may exist in Europa's under-ice ocean, perhaps subsisting in an environment similar to Earth's deep-ocean hydrothermal vents or the Antarctic Lake Vostok. Life in such an ocean could possibly be similar to microbial life on Earth in the deep ocean. So far, {{there is no evidence that}} life exists on Europa, but the likely presence of liquid water has spurred calls to send a probe there.|$|E

5|$|The first {{segments}} of road {{appeared in the}} location of what would become RE11 by 1940. The southern road segment began at an at-grade intersection, near the location of RE11, and traveled northward, before traveling slightly westward and terminating at a dead end. The road was graded and drained, and had a gravel <b>surface,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cattle guard near the middle of it. The northern segment of road traveled near the location of RE11. This road was also graded and drained, and had three cattle guards located along its course. By 1951, a gate had {{been added to the}} southern road segment, and the northern segment had several turns straightened and lengthened. On October 28, 1953, RM 2134 was designated from Millersview along a road to the northern segment of what would become RE11. On August 24, 1955, the highway was designated along the northern segment of road, to the Colorado River. The designation was made official on October 1, 1955.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{begins with a}} purple liquid forming the word 'JANET'. Jackson is then shown {{sitting on top of}} a planet in outer space, wearing a {{bodysuit}} adorned with jewelry, long ponytail, and mask. Various asteroids and dancers mounting planets in black latex attire and helmets are shown. Jackson flips her ponytail, revealing her face as cosmic dust is tossed about. Several dancers leap to other planets as Jackson descends to a cratered surface, performing abstract choreography with two dancers. Jackson jumps to another setting, shown in slow motion as the audio is filtered, landing on a white liquid <b>surface</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> crimson atmosphere. Backed by eight dancers, Jackson performs the song's choreography as various objects crash into the liquid. Jackson and the dancers fall into the liquid, with Jackson reemerging in a red catsuit. Jackson then performs a dance routine with six glowing spheres. The final sphere ascends upward as fourteen white liquid objects explode.|$|E
5|$|Unless a star {{is being}} {{observed}} {{from the direction}} of its pole, sections of the surface have some amount of movement toward or away from the observer. The component of movement that is {{in the direction of the}} observer is called the radial velocity. For the portion of the <b>surface</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> radial velocity component toward the observer, the radiation is shifted to a higher frequency because of Doppler shift. Likewise the region that has a component moving away from the observer is shifted to a lower frequency. When the absorption lines of a star are observed, this shift at each end of the spectrum causes the line to broaden. However, this broadening must be carefully separated from other effects that can increase the line width.|$|E

5|$|By 1801 the {{population}} of both Manchester and Salford was about 94,000. By 1861 this had risen to about 460,000, and so {{in the same year}} John Greenwood Jr. made an application to Salford Borough Council and to the Pendleton Turnpike Trust, to build a tramway from Pendleton to Albert Bridge in Salford. The system was innovative in that the rails were designed to be 'flush' with the road <b>surface,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> third central rail to accommodate a perambulator wheel attached to the front axle of the omnibus. Approval was granted and work commenced immediately, with the horse-pulled tramway finished in September 1861. It remained in use for a further eleven years when the condition of the track had deteriorated such that the council ordered it removed. The Tramways Act 1870 allowed councils to construct their own tramways, and on 17 May 1877 the 'Manchester and Salford Tramways' opened for business. The network of lines was largely complete by September 1880, the company changed its name to the Manchester Carriage and Tramways Company, and the system reached its peak in the 1890s. A steam tramway was opened on 12 April 1883 from Bury to Higher Broughton. The vehicles provoked letters of complaints from residents about the associated noise, dirt, and grease, and by 1888 the route was eventually curtailed to Besses o' th' Barn.|$|E

40|$|The {{adsorption}} {{processes of}} an Si atom on GaAs(1 1 1) A surfaces under growth conditions are investigated {{on the basis}} of first-principles surface phase diagrams, in which adsorption–desorption behavior is described by comparing the calculated adsorption energy obtained by total-energy electronic-structure calculations with vapor-phase chemical potential estimated by quantum statistical mechanics. The calculated surface phase diagram as functions of temperature and As 2 pressure demonstrates that both Ga and As atoms are adsorbed on the Ga-vacancy site of GaAs(1 1 1) A-(2 × 2) surface under low As-pressure conditions, resulting in the formation of (2 × 2) <b>surface</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> As adatom. The surface phase diagrams as functions of temperature and Si pressure also reveal that an Si atom can be adsorbed on the (2 × 2) <b>surface</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> As adatom for temperatures less than ∼ 1160 K and this Si atom can occupy one of As-lattice sites after the incorporation of another As atom, leading to p-type conductivity. In contrast, the (2 × 2) <b>surface</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> As trimer is found to be stabilized under high As-pressure conditions. The surface phase diagram for Si incorporation clarify that an Si atom can be adsorbed at one of Ga-lattice sites of the (2 × 2) <b>surface</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> As trimer for temperatures less than ∼ 870 K. These calculated results provide one of possible explanations for the formation of p-type and n-type GaAs on GaAs(1 1 1) A surfaces under low and high As-pressure conditions, respectively...|$|R
