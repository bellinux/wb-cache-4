40|$|Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) design {{requires}} an integration of elements from {{two or more}} disparate physical domains: mechanical (translational, rotational, hydraulic), electrical, magnetic, thermal, etc. Different parts of a MEMS system are traditionally designed separately, using different methodologies and different tools applied to different energy domains. Although major Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) such as VHDL, Verilog and SystemC have been supplemented with analogue and mixed-signal (AMS) extensions which are essential in analogue and mixed-technology design, development of corresponding analogue and mixed-technology synthesis methodologies is still lagging behind. Therefore, there is an increasing need for automated synthesis techniques that can reduce the development cycle and facilitate the generation of optimal configurations. This research investigates and develops techniques for automated high-level performance optimisation and synthesis of mixed-technology MEMS systems. Results of this research {{have been published in}} 9 papers at peer reviewed international conferences and one two-part journal paper. Specific contributions of this research can be summarised as follows. Firstly, a dedicated distributed model of a mixed-technology MEMS case study of an accelerometer operating in a Sigma-Delta force-feedback control scheme is developed. The distributed behaviour is essential in the MEMS accelerometer design because it has been observed that <b>sense</b> <b>finger</b> resonance, usually not included in conventional models, affects the performance of the electromechanical Sigma-Delta feedback control. As shown in the simulation results, the Sigma-Delta loop failure, when the <b>sense</b> <b>fingers</b> bend seriously or oscillate, is captured by the proposed model but cannot be correctly modelled using conventional approach. Secondly, a novel, holistic approach is proposed for automated optimal layout synthesis of MEMS systems embedded in electronic control circuitry from user-defined high-level performance specifications and design constraints. The synthesis technique has been implemented in SystemC-A and named SystemC-AGNES. The method efficiently, and in an automated manner, generates suitable layouts of mechanical sensing element and configurations of the Sigma-Delta control loop by combining primitive components stored in a library and optimising them according to user specifications. Synthesis results show that the proposed technique explores the configuration space effectively, and it develops new structures which have not been investigated before. This contribution has been published as a two part paper in the Sensors & Transducers Journal. Finally, to enhance the modelling efficiency and capability of SystemC-A, for mixed-technology systems with crucial distributed behaviour, language extension has been proposed to efficiently support general partial differential equations(PDEs) modelling.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a new z-axis high-sensitivity silicon-micromachined capacitive accelerometer fabricated us-ing a three-mask dissolved-wafer process (DWP). It employs capacitive sensing using overlap-area variations between comb electrodes and a torsional suspension system to provide high sensitivity without compromising bandwidth, full-scale range, or the pull-in voltage ceiling. Excellent electrical sensitivity is obtained by using high-aspect-ratio comb fingers with narrow air gaps of 2 m {{and a large}} overlap area of 12 m 300 m. Torsional suspension beams 150 m long with a cross-sectional area of 12 m 3 m are used to improve the mechani-cal gain. Simulations of the capacitance between <b>sense</b> <b>fingers</b> show a highly linear region over a wide 14 -m tip deflection range. Accelerometers were fabricated and yielded sensitivities of 263 – 300 mV/g, a nonlinearity less than 0. 2 % over a range of 4 to + 3 g, a full-scale range of 4 to + 6 g, and pull-in voltages greater than 8 V. A 3 -dB cutoff frequency of 35 Hz was measured in air. The calculated thermomechanical noise in the sensor is 0. 28 mg over this bandwidth.

These sensors can be realized with different techniques, but the mostly adopted are based on a resistive element film, which can be made of a PEDOT:PSS polymer or of a carbon-based element, printed on a plastic substrate.

This was to provide enhanced degrees of understanding and predictability in performances. Experiments were conducted on custom-made flex sensors based on PEDOT:PSS polymer, to measure the resistance variations vs. the amount of bend radius induced in the sensors, in either of two opposing directions (outward and inward). Results demonstrated that the mechanical behavior influences the electrical counterpart but linearly, the more the bent the more the increase in the resistance, in a direct proportion.

In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} state of the art in tactile sensing for mechatronics. We define a tactile sensor as a device or system that can measure a given {{property}} of an object or contact event through physical contact between the sensor and the object. We consider any property that can be measured through contact, including the shape of an object, texture, temperature, hardness, moisture content, etc. A comprehensive search of the literature revealed that there was a significant increase in publications on tactile sensing from 1991 onwards. Considerable effort in the 1980 s was spent investigating transduction techniques and developing new sensors, whilst emphasis in more recent research has focused on experiments using tactile sensors to perform a variety of tasks. This paper reports on progress in tactile sensing in the following areas: cutaneous sensors, <b>sensing</b> <b>fingers,</b> soft materials, industrial robot grippers, multifingered hands, probes and whiskers, analysis of sensing devices, haptic perception, processing sensory data and new application areas. We conclude that the predominant choice of transduction method is piezoelectric, with arrays using resistive or capacitive sensing. We found that increased emphasis on understanding tactile sensing and perception issues has opened up potential for new application areas. The predicted growth in applications in industrial automation has not eventuated. New applications for tactile sensing including surgery, rehabilitation and service robotics, and food processing automation show considerable potential and are now receiving significant levels of research attention.

The NI occurs when one person places his/her palm against another person's opposite palm and strokes the two joint index fingers with the other hand synchronously. When the stroking is asynchronous the NI is usually reduced or absent. Results suggest that individuals with ASD were more susceptible to the NI than controls, indicating that the illusion occurred independently of the type of stroking.

40|$|Touch screens allow {{users to}} {{interact}} with virtual objects directly below their fingertips. The proximity of input and output blurs {{the line between the}} physical and the virtual world, allowing the interactions to feel natural. However, direct finger input has several limitations. Compared to the tip of a graphics stylus, a fingertip is bigger and softer, making it more likely to occlude the screen and generate ambiguous touch signals. Furthermore, touch screens register any contact, making it more likely that they will respond to unintentional input, such as pressing a button when a finger just brushes pass it. These two problems exemplify issues in two types of input accuracy: space accuracy (“where it is being touched”) and state accuracy (“whether it is being touched”). In this thesis, we investigate space and state accuracy in four usage scenarios. First, we focused on users with hand tremors, whose involuntary finger oscillation causes them to miss targets and creates spurious touches and releases. To improve touch screen accessibility, we investigated how tremors influence touch input. Then, we designed and evaluated an alternative interaction technique that leverages the tremor movement characteristics for more accurate input. Second, we addressed a state accuracy problem in indirect multi-touch systems, in which a horizontal multi-touch screen is used to control cursors on a vertical display for ergonomic usage. We operationalized measures for state slips and compared four techniques for controlling the state of cursors. Third, we augmented touch screens with near-surface interaction by <b>sensing</b> <b>fingers</b> hovering in a thin layer above the screen surface. We determined appropriate layer thickness to minimize the likelihood that the fingers will slip out of the layer. Finally, we tackled the problem where touch contacts drift away from buttons when users employ touch screens without looking at them. Here, we assessed how magnetic forces might substitute for vision by guiding the fingertips towards the button in these scenarios. While the findings contribute to the body of scientific knowledge in each specific usage scenario, the insights derived from all four scenarios in combination suggest strategies for designing touch interaction techniques to maximize space and state accuracy...|$|R
