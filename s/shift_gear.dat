50|$|Inside, {{the front}} seats were revised for greater comfort {{and to allow}} a slight {{increase}} in rear leg room. The passenger front seat received the same full 10-way power control as the driver's seat. Both front seats featured active head restraint systems, and the existing seat-heating feature was supplemented by six levels of cooling ventilation. Controls for heating and air conditioning were simplified, and additional individual vent controls were added for the driver and passenger. The <b>shift</b> <b>gear</b> no longer had a gated sequence, but moved straight fore and aft like the ones in the Acura TSX and Acura TL. Simulated woodgrain trim was added to the steering wheel and the top of the shifter, to emphasize the RL's upscale aspirations compared to its less costly TL and TSX siblings.|$|E
5000|$|The Holden EH was an {{automobile}} produced by General Motors-Holden's in Australia from 1963 to 1965.The EH {{was released in}} August 1963 replacing the Holden EJ series {{and was the first}} Holden to incorporate the new [...] "Red" [...] engine, with a 7 main bearing crankshaft instead of the 4 main bearing crankshaft used in the [...] "Grey" [...] engine. The larger capacity 149 ci (2400cc) engine was first only sold attached to a three-speed manual gear box or the [...] "Hydramatic" [...] three-speed automatic transmission with a (column shift). The 179 ci (2900cc) engine was only sold with the [...] "Hydramatic" [...] three-speed. The first EH with a 179 ci engine and a manual gear box, was called the [...] "EH-S4". The 179ci engine then became available with an up-graded manual gear box, with stronger gears than the 149ci gear box. The three-speed manual (column <b>shift)</b> <b>gear</b> boxes had no synchromesh on first gear, requiring double de-clutching. The 179 ci manual also used an up-graded clutch.|$|E

The XLS introduced standard cargo nets, six-disc CD changer, a power sliding-glass moonroof, electrochromic auto dimming rear-view and driver's side-view mirrors, four-way passenger power seat and a HomeLink transceiver. The high-end Limited trim offered air-ventilated seats {{with a power}} driver's seat cushion length adjuster, Toyota's Smart Key System with keyless push-button start and entry, a quieter acoustic windshield, rain-sensing windshield wipers, an upgraded 12-speaker JBL audio system, [...] "in-glass" [...] LED turn signals on the side mirrors and a wood-trimmed steering wheel and <b>shift</b> <b>gear</b> lever. A navigation system was optional for every trim level other than the XL version. The Avalon had a flat rear floor design and reclining rear seats. Vehicle Stability Control was optional on all trim levels. Other options included a keyless Remote Engine Start, rear window power sunshade and, on Limited models, a Dynamic Laser Cruise Control system. HID lighting with auto-leveling was standard on Touring and Limited grades.|$|E

5000|$|Foot {{clutches}} with tank shifters were {{standard on}} American motorcycles such as Harley-Davidson and Indian {{up to the}} mid-20th century and many custom bikes today still employ this system. The system used by Harley-Davidson arranged the controls with the tank shifter {{on the left side}} of the motorcycle, with the throttle operated by the right hand and the shifter, spark contol and front brake operated by the left hand. The Harley-Davidson rocker clutch was operated with the left foot with the heel down position to disengage the clutch (with an over-center spring to hold the clutch disengaged) and the toe down position to engage it ("Toe-to-go"). The right foot operated the rear brake, as is the practice in modern times. Indian, meanwhile arranged things differently. On an Indian, the tank shifter was located on the right side of the motorcycle, with the throttle operated by the left hand and the shifter, spark control and front brake operated by the right hand. (Indian promoted their system to police departments saying that the officer could fire his service weapon with his right hand while riding) The Indian rocker clutch was also operated by the left foot, but the toe down position disengaged the clutch and the heel down position engaged it. Harley-Davidson introduced the hand clutch on the 1952 Panhead, and simultaneously on the K model, their all-new sport model. The transmissions of the foot shift and the hand shift models were different. The hand <b>shift</b> <b>gear</b> selector mechanism was referred to as the [...] "jockey top" [...] or [...] "jockey lid." [...] On this transmission, the gears were selected in a linear fashion with the selector arm moving further and further forward with each successive gear and the gear lever moved in a slotted gate on the side of the tank. When modified to operate as a [...] "jockey shifter," [...] The lever would be pushed back for 1st gear and then step by step more forward for each subsequent gear. The foot <b>shift</b> <b>gear</b> selector mechanism was referred to as the [...] "ratchet top". On this transmission, the gears were selected in a ratcheting motion, returning to its default, central position after each shift. When modified to operate with short, transmission mounted hand lever and a foot suicide clutch, this type of set-up was referred to as a [...] "slap shifter" [...] or [...] "slapper". In contrast to the jockey shifter, the slap shifter would always stay in one central position between shifts. Throughout the 50s and 60s on the Panheads and subsequent Shovelheads, foot clutches and hand clutches coexisted, with the hand clutch being progressively more popular over time. After foot clutches had all but disappeared from Harley-Davidson civilian models, the last holdout of foot clutches were the police models up to the early 70's, presumably because the police officers could use their 2-way radio with the left hand while clutching with their foot.|$|E

40|$|Clutch fill {{control in}} clutch-to-clutch {{transmissions}} influences shift quality considerably. An oncoming clutch {{should be applied}} synchronously {{with the release of}} an offgoing clutch to <b>shift</b> <b>gear</b> smoothly; therefore, the gap between the piston and clutch plates should be eliminated when the torque capacity is near zero {{at the end of the}} clutch fill phase. Open-loop control is typically implemented for the clutch fill because of the cost of pressure sensor. Low control precision causes underfill or overfill to occur, deteriorating shift quality. In this paper, a mathematical model of an electrohydraulic clutch shift control system is presented. Special dynamic characteristic parameters for optimal clutch fill control are subsequently proposed. An automatic method for predicting initial fill control parameters is proposed to eliminate distinct discrepancies among transmissions caused by manufacturing or assembling errors. To prevent underfill and overfill, a fuzzy adaptive control method is proposed, in which clutch fill control parameters are adjusted self-adaptively and continually. Road vehicle test results proved that applying the fuzzy adaptive method ensures the consistency of shift quality even after the transmission’s status is changed...|$|E
