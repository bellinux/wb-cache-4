25|$|In most cassettes, the {{magnetic}} tape {{is attached to}} each spool with a leader, usually made of strong plastic. This leader protected the weaker magnetic tape from the shock occurring when the tape reached the end. Leaders can be complex: a plastic <b>slide-in</b> wedge anchors a short fully opaque plastic tape to the take-up hub; one or more tinted semi-opaque plastic segments follow; the clear leader (a tintless semi-opaque plastic segment) follows, which wraps almost {{all the way around}} the supply reel, before splicing to {{the magnetic}} tape itself. The clear leader spreads the shock load to a long stretch of tape instead of to the microscopic splice. Various patents have been issued detailing leader construction and associated tape player mechanisms to detect leaders. Cassette tape users would also use spare leaders to repair broken tapes.|$|E

50|$|The {{new stadium}} will feature two pitches—an {{advanced}} artificial pitch {{to be used}} primarily for American football, and a <b>slide-in</b> grass pitch {{to be used for}} association football. This is similar to the setup of the Sapporo Dome in Japan, a venue used for both baseball and association football. On 7 July 2015, Tottenham and the National Football League (NFL) announced that the new stadium would host at least two NFL games each season from 2018 through to 2027.|$|E
5000|$|In 1973, a {{new model}} was offered: The heavy duty F-350 V8. This was a new {{heavy-duty}} pickups made with contractors and camping enthusiasts in mind. It rode on longer wheelbase than an F-100 or F-250 (140 in vs. 133 in) but had the same overall length. Ordering the Camper Special package for the F-350 SRW made it a [...] "Super Camper Special", which was designed for the much heavier <b>slide-in</b> campers coming on the market at that time.|$|E
5000|$|For the first-generation Super Duty range, Ford used several {{different}} suspension configurations, {{depending on the}} model of truck. All models have heavy-duty 3" [...] wide leaf springs and staggered shock absorbers. A standard stabilizer bar is included on dual rear-wheel models and an option on single rear-wheel versions. An optional <b>slide-in</b> camper certification package with heavier-duty springs was available on single rear-wheel models. All versions of the Super Duty trucks came equipped with four-wheel disc brakes.|$|E
5000|$|For {{some models}} the option exists to have {{mounting}} rails underneath the riflescope {{to provide for}} mounting solutions that do not use scope rings. These rails {{are an integral part}} of the scope body and can not be removed. The most recent rail mounting system of Schmidt & Bender is their propriety [...] "Convex rail". The Convex rail uses matching <b>slide-in</b> mount fasteners to connect the riflescope to the gun and offers the possibility to tilt the scope up to 1° to the left or right.|$|E
50|$|Gallas {{started the}} 2009-10 {{campaign}} in fine form, scoring three goals {{in his first}} three games. He formed a partnership with Belgian centre back Thomas Vermaelen, Arsenal's only major summer signing, and the pair scored seven goals between them in their first eight league games. On 22 August, in the first home game of the season, he scored a bizarre goal against Portsmouth; Vermaelen had attempted to score a <b>slide-in</b> from a corner kick, but Gallas accidentally flicked the ball onto his face and it bounced into the net.|$|E
5000|$|The Questar 3.5” entered {{commercial}} production in 1954 with ads {{for the model}} run in many astronomy, science, photography, and nature related magazines such as National Geographic, Scientific American and Sky & Telescope. The ads focused on the telescope's mechanical and optical design, educational value for children, ease of use, and adaptations as a spotting scope and telephoto lens. The Questar of the 1950s and early 1960s had a proprietary screw in eyepiece design and offered little capacity to employ third-party accessories. Later models accept standard <b>slide-in</b> 1.25" [...] eyepieces and other accessories.|$|E
50|$|Equipping {{pickup trucks}} with camper shells {{provides}} a small living space for camping. <b>Slide-in</b> truck campers, {{on the other}} hand, give a pickup truck the amenities of a small motorhome, but still allow the operator the option of removal and independent use of the vehicle.Some diesel engined pickups are modified to produce more diesel exhaust and {{have been described as}} rolling coal. Changes are designed to produce visibly polluting sooty emissions and include the intentional removal of the particulate filter, as well as installing smoke switches and smoke stacks. Modifications may cost from $2,000 to $5,000.|$|E
50|$|The {{photograph}} {{on the right}} (and slightly below this paragraph) shows several racks inside Ambergate Exchange. Although the first TXE2-type exchange to go into public service, it actually consisted of Plessey pre-production equipment, called Pentex. The clumsy large handles {{on the front of}} the <b>slide-in</b> units are the obvious distinguishing feature. It is also apparent that the racks and units are painted in battleship grey. The change from this to the 'light straw' colour of all subsequent exchanges was a significant change in an organisation where exchange equipment had been battleship grey for as long as any telephone engineer could remember.|$|E
50|$|SeahorseA rugged {{handheld}} computer {{based on the}} Newton OS 2.0, the Seahorse was backlit, lightweight, and durable, {{with a variety of}} integrated communication capabilities: the first CDPD modem ever in a wireless PDA, PCMCIA slot, WLAN modem, and a modular snap-on nose for optional GPS and diffused infrared capabilities. A rugged boot protected Seahorse, while large-capacity, <b>slide-in</b> rechargeable batteries provided around eight hours of continuous use. Together these features made Seahorse a good solution for: remote handheld access to customer service databases, wireless Internet access, precision location applications utilizing handheld GPS systems, and wirelessly accessing corporate and Internet databases to utilize schematics and manuals while in the field.|$|E
50|$|All the TXE2-specific {{equipment}} was mounted on <b>slide-in</b> units, mainly single-width, but some double-width. There was a carefully structured holding of maintenance spare units. For those which {{were likely to}} be needed frequently or urgently in every exchange, such as a Subscribers Line Unit (a single unit containing the line relays and A-switches for five customers), a spare unit was held in every exchange. For those units for which a spare was likely to be needed less frequently or urgently, the spares were held at an Area centre serving perhaps 6-10 TXE2s of the same manufacture. Finally for those units for which a spare was likely to be needed seldom, the spare units were held Regionally. There were 10 Regions in BT at that time.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} standard prism mounting {{rail system}} requires {{to have the}} scope rail drilled from the side for fixture screws. The more recent propriety systems mainly offer aesthetic advantages {{for people who have}} problems with redundant drill holes in sight in case the riflescope is used on different guns. To avoid drilling the scope rail, the propriety rail mounting systems have special shape connections machined in the inside of the rail. These shape connections prevent ever showing any exterior damage from mounting work on the rifle scope. The propriety rail systems use matching <b>slide-in</b> mount fasteners to connect the riflescope to the gun. Some propriety rails also offer the possibility to tilt the scope up to 1° to the left or right.|$|E
50|$|Like {{diatonic}} harmonicas, chromatics {{are available}} in numerous tunings. However, there are three more popular versions: one is Irish tuning, whereby notes are flattened (instead of sharpened) when the slide is in. This makes playing Irish music and, to a certain extent, blues, easier, since Irish music is commonly played in either the key of D or key of G. The use of C, with no sharps or flats, and B, with all flats, allows common Irish modes to be played while the downward-tuning slide allows ornamentation {{in keeping with the}} Irish tradition. Irish tuning can be achieved easily by reversing the slide (flipping the slide upside down) of a chromatic in the key of B major; alternatively, one can use the B major as is, but with <b>slide-in</b> as the home position.|$|E

The promotion featured all six animated Classics released to that point (including The Sword in the Stone, reduced in price for the first time, and Pinocchio, back from a short 8½ month moratorium) and five favorite live action features at $29.95, all in white clamshells with <b>slide-in</b> artwork. All six animated Classics collection titles were also available in a limited edition box set for $179.70. This promotion included assorted Christmas-themed titles at $19.95 and $14.95, and Disney sold almost 5 million tapes that Christmas season, more than any other studio.|$|E

50|$|The {{much smaller}} Remreed crosspoints, {{introduced}} {{at about the}} same time as 1AESS, were packaged as grid boxes of four principal types. Type 10A Junctor Grids and 11A Trunk Grids were a box about 16x16x5 inches (40x40x12 cm) with sixteen 8x8 switches inside. Type 12A Line Grids with 2:1 LCR were only about 5 inches (12 cm) wide, with eight 4x4 Stage 0 line switches with ferrods and cutoff contacts for 32 lines, connected internally to four 4x8 Stage 1 switches connecting to B-links. Type 14A Line Grids with 4:1 LCR were about 16x12x5 inches (40x30x12 cm) with 64 lines, 32 A-links and 16 B-links. The boxes were connected to the rest of the fabric and control circuitry by <b>slide-in</b> connectors. Thus the worker had to handle a much bigger, heavier piece of equipment, but didn't have to unwrap and rewrap dozens of wires.|$|E

40|$|<b>Slide-in</b> Bridge Construction (SIBC) is {{different}} from the conventional bridge construction because of the activity required to move the bridge to final position following construction. Moving activity requires bridge to be on a temporary support structure, resting on a sliding system such as bearings suitable for sliding, and a system of force actuation for pushing or pulling the bridge. Two SIBC projects were recently completed in Michigan, USA. SIBC being new to the bridge community, substructure forces that are developed during slides are best estimated. Hence, one of the Michigan projects was selected and slide operation was simulated using dynamic explicit finite element analysis techniques. This article presents use of dynamic explicit finite element analysis for evaluating temporary substructure forces during bridge slide. Further the analysis results are used to explain the impact of unequal friction at sliding surfaces and differential alignment of the temporary supports on substructure forces and bridge superstructure movement. Typically, bridge superstructures are slid in place using forcecontrolled systems. Analysis was performed using force-controlled and displacement-controlled methods. Then, the analysis results are used to explain the benefits of using displacement-controlled methods with force monitoring to slide a bridge rather than employing a force-controlled method...|$|E
40|$|For {{several years}} the Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT), Iowa State University, the Federal Highway Administration, and several Iowa {{counties}} {{have been working}} to develop accelerated bridge construction (ABC) concepts, details, and processes. Throughout this development, much has been learned and has resulted in Iowa being viewed as a national leader {{in the area of}} ABC. However, at this time, the Office of Bridges and Structures does not have a complete set of working standards nor design examples to accompany ABC portions of the bridge design manual (now called the Load and Resistance Factor Design/LRFD Bridge Design Manual). During the fall of 2013, the Iowa DOT constructed a bridge on IA 92 in Cass County using an ABC technique known as <b>slide-in</b> bridge construction. During the design of the Cass County Bridge, several questions were raised about the performance of critical design and construction details: the pile-to-pile cap connection and the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) coated bearing pads on which the bridge would slide. The timing of this specific need and the initiation of this project offered a unique opportunity to provide significant short- and long-term value to the Office of Bridges and Structures. Several full-scale laboratory tests, which included several variations of the pile-to-pile cap connection and bearing pad slides, were completed. These tests proved that the connection was capable of achieving the desired capacity and that the expected coefficient of friction of the bearing pads was reasonably low. Finally, a design tool was developed for the Office of Bridges and Structures to be used on future projects that might benefit from a precast pile cap...|$|E
