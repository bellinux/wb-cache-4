40|$|Aerobic defluorination of the {{inhalation}} anaesthetic agent, <b>synthane,</b> {{was compared}} with that of methoxyflurane, enflurane and halothane and with two other anaesthetics, isoflurane and sevo-flurane. In vitro, in microsomes prepared from phenobarbitone-induced and control livers, <b>synthane</b> and halothane were not defluorinated. The relative order of defluorination of the other anaesthetics was methoxyflurane> sevoflurane> enflurane> isoflurane. In vivo, following 4 h of 1. 2 % (MAC) <b>synthane</b> anaesthesia, urinary inorganic fluoride excretion was increased by only a trivial amount and only in phenobarbitone-treated rats; polyuria was not observed. <b>Synthane</b> is the least metabolized of the fluorinated ether anaesthetics; its administration will not result in inorganic fluoride neph-ropathy. An index of nephrotoxic potential for fluorinated anaesthetic agents was formulated utilizing in vitro fluoride production data and oil: gas partition coefficients. In vivo biotransformation of an inhalation anaesthetic agent was first demonstrated by Barrett and Johnston (1939) who recovered trichloroacetic acid from the urine of dogs anaesthetized with trichloroethylene. Metabolism of other inhalation anaesthetics was no...|$|E
