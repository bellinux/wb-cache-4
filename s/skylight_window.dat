60|$|His first impulse, {{under these}} circumstances, was doubtless {{to try to}} {{extinguish}} the flames, and failing in that, his second impulse (ignorant as he was {{of the state of}} the lock) had been to attempt to escape by the door which had given him entrance. When I had called to him, the flames must have reached across the door leading into the church, on either side of which the presses extended, and close to which the other combustible objects were placed. In all probability, the smoke and flame (confined as they were to the room) had been too much for him when he tried to escape by the inner door. He must have dropped in his death-swoon--he must have sunk in the place where he was found--just as I got on the roof to break the <b>skylight</b> <b>window.</b> Even if we had been able, afterwards, to get into the church, and to burst open the door from that side, the delay must have been fatal. He would have been past saving, long past saving, by that time. We should only have given the flames free ingress into the church--the church, which was now preserved, but which, in that event, would have shared the fate of the vestry. There is no doubt in my mind, there can be no doubt in the mind of any one, that he was a dead man before ever we got to the empty cottage, and worked with might and main to tear down the beam.|$|E

50|$|The 310G was {{certified}} in 1961 and introduced the canted wingtip fuel tanks {{found on the}} majority of the Cessna twin-engined product line, marketed as 'stabila-tip' tanks by Cessna because they were meant to aid stability in flight. A single side window replaced the rear two windows on the 310K ({{certified in}} late 1965), with optional three-blade propellers being introduced as well. Subsequent developments included the 310Q and turbocharged T310Q with a redesigned rear cabin featuring a <b>skylight</b> <b>window,</b> and the final 310R and T310R, identifiable by a lengthened nose containing a baggage compartment. Production ended in 1980.|$|E
50|$|After {{a heated}} {{argument}} between Leonardo and Raphael, Raphael {{goes up to}} the roof of April's building and is attacked by dozens of Foot Clan members. The fight moves into the building, where April and the others are attacked after Raphael is thrown down a <b>skylight</b> <b>window.</b> The numbers cause the floor to give way, and they continue their battle in the basement. After Foot reinforcements arrive, overwhelming the turtles, Casey appears, having seen Raphael earlier on the roof and he helps even the odds. In the melee, with Raphael in a coma, the building catches fire, forcing the Turtles to escape. Retreating to an abandoned farm April's family owns, April learns that Charles has fired her from the TV station. Raphael awakens from his coma and makes amends with Leonardo. The four of them train. After receiving visions from Splinter, Leonardo and the rest decide it is time to return to the city. Meanwhile, Danny encounters Splinter, whose kindness casts doubts on his decision to betray the Turtles. He goes to hide in the Turtles' den, and is there when they return. In the night, Danny slips away, followed by Casey who discovers the thieves' hideout. Danny meets with Splinter again, who tells him the story of his master who was killed by a man named Oroku Saki, whom he and Splinter realize was The Shredder himself 15 years prior. Danny grasps how insane The Shredder truly is after learning his past, but he inadvertently alerts him that the turtles have returned. The Shredder sends his men to raid the turtles' home, but the Foot are ambushed as the group has already anticipated their attack.|$|E

5|$|Lighting {{also served}} Gaudí for the {{organisation}} of space, which required a careful {{study of the}} gradient of light intensity to adequately adapt to each specific environment. He achieved this with different elements such as <b>skylights,</b> <b>windows,</b> shutters and blinds; a notable case is the gradation of colour used in the atrium of the Casa Batlló to achieve uniform distribution of light throughout the interior. He also tended to build south-facing houses to maximise sunlight.|$|R

As she lies on the ground, she sees several Slayers fall, {{including}} Amanda. In {{the halls of the}} school, a few Turok-Han make it to the surface and attack the group guarding the entrances. A small group of Bringers also appear and attack. During the battle, Anya is bisected by a Bringer. Andrew fights until he is overwhelmed. Principal Wood is stabbed by a Bringer who is then killed by Giles. Xander and Dawn take on some Turok-Han who are disintegrated by sunlight when Dawn throws open a <b>skylight</b> <b>window,</b> but more follow.

[...] Buffy arises with renewed determination and knocks several Turok-Han off the ledge. Other Slayers are reinvigorated as well. Just then, Spike's amulet consumes him in blue light and blasts a hole upward into the sky. The sunlight is channeled through his soul to the amulet and in powerful rays that begin dusting the ubervamps. The ground begins to shake and rocks tumble. The few surviving Slayers start to flee. Buffy tells Spike to do so as well, but he insists on finishing it. They share a quiet moment as the world crumbles around them. With tears in her eyes, Buffy tells Spike she loves him (fulfilling a prediction by Cassie in [...] "Help"); Spike replies, [...] "No you don't. But thanks for saying it." [...] He orders her to leave as he has to stay and finish the job. As Buffy flees, Spike laughs, [...] "I wanna see how it ends." [...] Spike burns to dust as the Hellmouth collapses.|$|E

The DeLuxe model featured eight rear side windows and two rear corner windows, making it the 15-window (not available in Europe). Meanwhile, the sunroof DeLuxe with its additional eight small <b>skylight</b> <b>windows</b> is, accordingly, the 23-window.
