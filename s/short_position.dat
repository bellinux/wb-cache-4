25|$|Since {{the risk}} of the inverse ETF and a fixed <b>short</b> <b>position</b> will differ {{significantly}} as the index drifts away from its initial value, differences in realized payoff have no clear interpretation. It may therefore be better to evaluate the performance assuming the index returns to the initial level. In that case an inverse ETF will always incur a volatility loss relative to the <b>short</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E
25|$|An inverse ETF, {{like any}} {{leveraged}} ETF, needs to buy {{when the market}} rises and sell when it falls {{in order to maintain}} a fixed leverage ratio. This results in a volatility loss proportional to the market variance. Compared to a <b>short</b> <b>position</b> with identical initial exposure, the inverse ETF will therefore usually deliver inferior returns. The exception is if the market declines significantly on low volatility so that the capital gain outweighs the volatility loss. Such large declines benefit the inverse ETF because the relative exposure of the <b>short</b> <b>position</b> drops as the market fall.|$|E
25|$|If one invests $100 in {{an inverse}} ETF {{position}} in an asset worth $100, and the asset's value changes to $80 {{and then to}} $60, then {{the value of the}} inverse ETF position will increase by 20% (because the asset decreased by 20% from 100 to 80) and then increase by 25% (because the asset decreased by 25% from 80 to 60). So the ETF's value will be $100*1.20*1.25=$150. The gain of an equivalent <b>short</b> <b>position</b> will however be $100–$60=$40, and so we see that the capital gain of the ETF outweighs the volatility loss relative to the <b>short</b> <b>position.</b> However, if the market swings back to $100 again, then the net profit of the <b>short</b> <b>position</b> is zero. However, since the value of the asset increased by 67% (from $60 to $100), the inverse ETF must lose 67%, meaning it will lose $100. Thus the investment in shorts went from $100 to $140 and back to $100. The investment in the inverse ETF, however, went from $100 to $150 to $50.|$|E

40|$|Recently many {{mutual funds}} have created hedge fund-like {{products}} for marketing to retail investors. This study empirically examines the value added for investors during the 2007 financial crisis from hedge fund-like mutual funds, including 130 / 30, market neutral, and long/short equity funds. Based {{on the information}} ratio, market neutral and long/short equity funds have higher risk-adjusted returns than a passive index fund. However, hedge fund-like mutual funds in general add no value for investors, based on either unconditional or conditional four-factor alphas, even in a down market. While <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> taken by these funds do generate alpha, the gain from <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> is not sufficiently large to offset the loss from long positions.

25|$|In finance, {{short selling}} (also known as {{shorting}} or going short) is {{the practice of}} selling securities or other financial instruments that are not currently owned (usually borrowed), and subsequently repurchasing them ("covering"). In {{the event of an}} interim price decline, the short seller profits, since the cost of (re)purchase is less than the proceeds received upon the initial (short) sale. Conversely, the <b>short</b> <b>position</b> closes out at a loss if the price of a shorted instrument rises prior to repurchase.|$|E
25|$|Section 955 of Dodd–Frank {{deals with}} employees' and directors' hedging practices.

50|$|The {{strategy}} holds long/short equity positions, {{with long}} <b>positions</b> hedged with <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> {{in the same}} and related sectors, so that the equity-market-neutral investor should be little affected by sector-wide events. This places, in essence, a bet that the long positions will outperform their sectors (or the <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> will under perform) regardless {{of the strength of}} the sectors. Equity-market-neutral strategy occupies a distinct place in the hedge fund landscape by exhibiting one of the lowest correlations with other alternative strategies.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{potential}} for foreign speculators to profit from simultaneously taking <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> in foreign exchange and equity markets under a fixed exchange rate regime, {{in what has been}} termed as the “double play. ” Such a strategy is considered when the monetary authority is faced with two conflicting objectives—exchange rate stability and low interest rates. While the monetary authority {{may not be able to}} directly intervene to stabilize interest rates under the fixed exchange rate regime, it may consider intervention in equity markets to head off speculative pressure on interest rates. The model determines market conditions where speculators may find the double play strategy profitable and the impact of government intervention on speculative <b>short</b> equity <b>positions</b> and the interest rate, concluding that intervention can never simultaneously reduce speculation in the equity and the money markets.

25|$|Contracts are {{negotiated}} at futures exchanges, which act as {{a marketplace}} between buyers and sellers. The buyer of a contract {{is said to be}} long position holder, and the selling party is said to be <b>short</b> <b>position</b> holder. As both parties risk their counter-party walking away if the price goes against them, the contract may involve both parties lodging a margin {{of the value of the}} contract with a mutually trusted third party. For example, in gold futures trading, the margin varies between 2% and 20% depending on the volatility of the spot market.|$|E
25|$|The {{particular}} synthetic CDO {{that the}} SEC's 2010 fraud suit charged Goldman with misleading investors with was called Abacus 2007-AC1. Unlike {{many of the}} Abacus securities, 2007-AC1 did not have Goldman Sachs as a short seller, in fact, Goldman Sachs lost money on the deal. That position {{was taken by the}} customer (John Paulson) who hired Goldman to issue the security (according to the SEC's complaint). Paulson and his employees selected 90 BBB-rated mortgage bonds that they believed were most likely to lose value and so the best bet to buy insurance for. Paulson and the manager of the CDO, ACA Management, worked on the portfolio of 90 bonds to be insured (ACA allegedly unaware of Paulson's <b>short</b> <b>position),</b> coming to an agreement in late February 2007. Paulson paid Goldman approximately US$15 million for its work in the deal. Paulson ultimately made a US$1 billion profit from the short investments, the profits coming from the losses of the investors and their insurers. These were primarily IKB Deutsche Industriebank (US$150 million loss), and the investors and insurers of another US$900 million—ACA Financial Guaranty Corp, ABN AMRO, and the Royal Bank of Scotland.|$|E
25|$|Future {{contracts}} are another way our farmer can hedge his risk without {{a few of}} the risks that forward contracts have. Future {{contracts are}} similar to forward contracts except they are more standardized (i.e. each contract is the same quantity and date for everyone). These contracts trade on exchanges and are guaranteed through clearinghouses. Clearinghouses ensure that every contract is honored and they take the opposite side of every contract. Future contracts typically are more liquid than forward contracts and move with the market. Because of this, the farmer can minimize the risk he faces in the future through the selling of future contracts. Future contracts also differ from forward contracts in that delivery never happens. The exchanges and clearinghouses allow the buyer or seller to leave the contract early and cash out. So tying back into the farmer selling his wheat at a future date, he will sell short futures contracts for the amount that he predicts to harvest to protect against a price decrease. The current (spot) price of wheat and the price of the futures contracts for wheat converge as time gets closer to the delivery date, so in order to make money on the hedge, the farmer must close out his position earlier than then. On the chance that prices decrease in the future, the farmer will make a profit on his <b>short</b> <b>position</b> in the futures market which offsets any decrease in revenues from the spot market for wheat. On the other hand, if prices increase, the farmer will generate a loss on the futures market which is offset by an increase in revenues on the spot market for wheat. Instead of agreeing to sell his wheat to one person on a set date, the farmer will just buy and sell futures on an exchange and then sell his wheat wherever he wants once he harvests it.|$|E
