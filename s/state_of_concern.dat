60|$|Caswall, who {{had never}} before seen any of these things, except those which he had {{collected}} himself, found a constant amusement and interest in them. He studied them, their uses, their mechanism--where there was such--and their places of origin, until he had an ample and real knowledge of all concerning them. Many were secret and intricate, but he never rested till he found out all the secrets. When once he had become interested in strange objects, {{and the way to}} use them, he began to explore various likely places for similar finds. He began to inquire of his household where strange lumber was kept. Several of the men spoke of old Simon Chester as one who knew everything in and about the house. Accordingly, he sent for the old man, who came at once. He was very old, nearly ninety years of age, and very infirm. He had been born in the Castle, and had served its succession of masters--present or absent--ever since. When Edgar began to question him on the subject regarding which he had sent for him, old Simon exhibited much perturbation. In fact, he became so frightened that his master, fully believing that he was concealing something, ordered him to tell at once what remained unseen, and where it was hidden away. Face to face with discovery of his secret, the old man, in a pitiable <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern,</b> spoke out even more fully than Mr. Caswall had expected.|$|E

5000|$|Economic {{anxiety is}} the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> {{about the future}} of one's {{economic}} prospects. It has been widely cited (e.g. by commentators at FiveThirtyEight as a major reason for Donald Trump's victory in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Other commentators, however, argue that economic anxiety was less of an important factor in predicting support for Trump than [...] "cultural anxiety," [...] or the feeling that one is a stranger in America and that undocumented immigrants should be deported. The term has also been used sarcastically in response to racist statements by Trump's supporters, to mock the attempts by centrist commentators to argue that support for Trump is due to concern about their economic prospects, not to racial attitudes.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} American rhetoric {{since the}} late 1990 s about the ‘rise of China’ in military and economic terms and compares it to the previous phenomenon of ‘Japan bashing. ’ In the 1980 s, Americans charged that the Japanese unfair trade practices were costing jobs and hastening America’s decline. While Japan’s stagnant economy in the 1990 s eased the bilateral relationship, China became the next rising <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern.</b> In addition to substantial trade deficits, the PRC is the US’ most formidable military competitor, has an appalling human rights record, and is not an ally. These factors raise the risk of serious conflict. 从 20 世纪 90 年代后期起，美国开始发表有关中国军事和经济“崛起”的言论，本文研究了这些言论，并将其与之前“抨击日本”的现象进行比较。 20 世纪 80 年代，美国指责日本不公平的贸易措施削减了美国的工作岗位并加速了美国的衰落。 20 世纪 90 年代，日本经济陷入滞胀，这缓和了美日双边关系，美国开始把注意力转向中国。除了高企的贸易赤字，中国还是美国在军事上最强大的竞争对手；中国的人权纪录十分可怕，中国也不是美国的盟友。这些因素都增加了爆发严重冲突的风险...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{quantum state}} {{transfer}} (QST) over binary-tree spin networks is studied by using advantages of partially collapsing measurements. To this aim, we perform initially a weak measurement (WM) on central qubit of the binary-tree network, which encoding the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> and after time {{evolution of the}} whole system, a quantum measurement reversal (QMR) on the destined qubit is performed. By taking the optimal value of the QMR, it is shown that the QST can be improved considerably by controlling the WM strength and by choosing it close enough to 1, near-perfect QST can be achieved. We also show that how entanglement distribution quality over the binary-tree spin network can be obviously improved by using this approach. Comment: 15 pages, 3 figure...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} newly manner to determine an Aggregate Quality (AQ), and consequently a global ranking, of Small and Median Enterprises (SMEs) based upon an {{integration of the}} traditional Return on Equity (ROE) or DuPont decomposition into Multicriteria Analysis methods. This approach designs and implements a method named ED-ROE, which is shown as a complementary way to evaluate companies’ ROE (profitability) and to mitigate some imbalances and inconsistencies presented by the traditional DuPont system under economic distress. Therefore, it goes beyond the well-known financial distress because considers not only debt problems, but also other set of criteria (e. g. business risk, operational risk and financial risk) that create a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> and worry on Decision Makers (shareholders and stakeholders). The AQ obtained from the ED-ROE approach, {{which is also a}} measurement of a company’s performance, relies on PROMETHÉE methods (Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations), and bases their results on outranking relationships in order to provide accurate information for comparing and evaluating SMEs under distressed environments and multiple decision criteria. The research also introduces some regression models to compare the ED-ROE approach and the DuPont system in terms of their outcomes, consistency, statistical significance, and explanatory power. Summarizing, the main research scope is to provide more elements to justify the decision making process, and offer, {{at least in the short}} term, the decision to choose the best SMEs in order to characterize a specific sector or economic activity. The AQ assessment also helps to identify companies that have a good operating management (net profit margin), strong asset management (asset turnover) and outstanding capital management throughout a simultaneously coherent leverage level...|$|E
