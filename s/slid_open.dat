25|$|The Duke's Company {{had already}} been using {{moveable}} scenery to good effect in their previous playhouses. It was first employed by Davenant at Rutland House, using shutters in grooves, which could be quickly <b>slid</b> <b>open</b> or closed to reveal a new scene, but Dorset Garden was also equipped to fly at least four separate people and large objects like a cloud covering the full width of the stage and carrying {{a large group of}} musicians (Psyche 1675). There were also numerous floor traps. It was designed for staging Restoration spectaculars, and was the only playhouse in London capable of all the effects these exuberant spectacles required.|$|E
2500|$|The new {{structure}} was a frameless plexiglas moulding which ballooned outwards {{at the top}} and sides, increasing the headroom and allowing increased visibility to the sides and rear. Because the {{new structure}} slid backward on runners, it could be <b>slid</b> <b>open</b> in flight. The aerial mast behind the canopy was replaced by a [...] "whip" [...] aerial which was mounted further aft and offset to the right. Most British Mk IIIs were equipped with Malcolm hoods. Several American service groups [...] "acquired" [...] the necessary conversion kits and some American P-51B/P-51Cs appeared with the new canopy, although the majority continued to use the original framed canopies.|$|E
2500|$|As in all muzzle-loading {{firearms}} (prior to {{the introduction}} of the percussion cap), the pan transmits the fire to the main charge of gunpowder inside the breech of the barrel, via a small hole (or [...] "vent") {{in the side of the}} breech, that gives on to the pan. The priming pan of all wheellocks is provided with a sliding cover that has two purposes, the first of which is to contain the priming powder and afford it some protection from the elements (the second is examined below, under 'Operation'). The pan cover may be <b>slid</b> <b>open</b> and closed by hand, but it is also attached to an arm inside the lock plate, which is acted upon by the eccentric on the shaft of the wheel.|$|E
50|$|Two {{models were}} offered at rollout: Sport and Limited. Wheel choices were 16-, 17- and 18 in. Among the more {{distinctive}} features was the Sky Slider, a power roof made from “reinforced acrylic cloth” that opens {{over the front}} and rear seats. The Sky <b>Slider</b> <b>opens</b> up to 60 in by 30 in, which was the largest opening in its class. Jeep claimed that the idea behind the Sky Slider was to give consumers the open-air feeling from previous Jeep models while maintaining the rigidity and safety of a sturdy frame.|$|R
5000|$|... 28 November 1949: A Douglas C-54A (F-BELO) {{struck a}} tree {{on a small}} hill while on final {{approach}} to Lyon and crashed. The aircraft <b>slid</b> in <b>open</b> country and caught fire. Four crew and one passenger died of 38 on board.|$|R
50|$|A {{retractable}} bridge or retractile {{bridge is}} a type of movable bridge in which the deck can be rolled or <b>slid</b> backwards to <b>open</b> a gap while traffic crosses, usually a ship on a waterway. This type is sometimes referred to as a thrust bridge.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the time}} that the Mk V was placed in {{production}} there were growing fears that the Luftwaffe were about to start mass-producing very high flying bombers such as the Junkers Ju 86, which could fly above the reach of most fighters of the time. It was decided that a new Spitfire variant would be required with improved high altitude performance. During a meeting held at the RAE at Farnborough on 17 February 1941 the Air Ministry asked [...] "that a Spitfire should be provided with a pressure cabin capable of maintaining a pressure differential of 1 lb per square inch at 40,000 feet." [...] A Marshall-manufactured compressor was to be used, and it was agreed that the sliding canopy could be replaced by one which could not be <b>slid</b> <b>open,</b> as long as it could be jettisoned by the pilot.|$|E

The Welin breech block uses an interrupted screw {{and is used}} on weapons with calibres from about 4 inches up to 16 inches or more. Other systems use a horizontal or vertical sliding block, in which a solid block is <b>slid</b> across the <b>open</b> breech from the side or bottom to seal the opening.|$|R
60|$|He {{hauled the}} sheets in until the boom hung {{just over the}} boat's quarter, and while Frank grasped the tiller she <b>slid</b> out into <b>open</b> water.

She seemed to be making an excellent pace, but Harry shook his head.|$|R
50|$|On 28 July 1943 American Airlines Flight 63 {{was flown}} by a Douglas DC-3, named Flagship Ohio, routing Cleveland-Columbus-Dayton-Cincinnati-Louisville-Nashville-Memphis, that crashed on the Louisville-Nashville sector about 1.6 mi west of Trammel, Kentucky. The {{aircraft}} descended from 200 ft until it struck trees, then <b>slid</b> across an <b>open</b> field {{and stopped in}} an upright position. Of the 22 people on board, 20 died. The cause of the crash was loss of control due to severe turbulence and violent downdrafts.|$|R

6000|$|The man vanished, and I {{sat still}} vacantly noticing how the prairie reeled behind me until the door <b>slid</b> <b>open</b> and he {{returned}} with a tin vessel {{and a group of}} curious passengers behind him. A piece of ice floated in the former, and a man held out a flask. [...] "I guess it won't hurt him, adulterated some," [...] he said.|$|E
50|$|This is {{a survey}} meter with a twist. Similar to the CDV-715, the CDV-720 is a fixed-position {{ionization}} chamber survey meter. Unlike any other survey meter, however, this unit has a movable beta shield {{on the bottom}} of the unit for detecting high levels of beta radiation. When <b>slid</b> to the <b>open</b> position, beta particles are allowed to directly penetrate the ionization chamber. With the beta shield closed, only gamma rays can penetrate both the shield and ionization chamber. This meter reads from 1R/h to 500R/h (X1, X10, and X100 scales).|$|R
50|$|Episode 19 (23 January 2008): Joel picked case #20. His rounds {{were pretty}} smooth, {{even though he}} opened some big amounts early. His luck <b>slid</b> when he <b>opened</b> all the large amounts later in the game, which caused the banker's offer to go down. He decided to play on and {{rejected}} the final offer of $1,200 and {{it was revealed that}} his case contained $2,500. He was followed by Sheryl, who chose case #6 and put her dog's collar on the case. She rejected the banker's first offer and opened the $250,000 in the second round. Time ran out before she opened the fifth and final case in the second round.|$|R
50|$|The Newark Bay rail {{accident}} {{occurred on}} September 15, 1958 in Newark Bay, New Jersey. A Central Railroad of New Jersey (CRRNJ) morning commuter train, #3314, ran through a restrictive and a stop signal, derailed, and <b>slid</b> off the <b>open</b> Newark Bay lift bridge. Both diesel locomotives {{and the first}} two coaches plunged into Newark Bay and sank immediately, killing 48 people. A third coach, snagged by its rear truck (bogie), hung precariously off the lift bridge for two hours before it also toppled into the water. As the locomotive crew was killed, {{the cause of the}} accident was never determined, and was never reinvestigated.|$|R
60|$|The car insultingly cheerful on the driveway. The {{car door}} opened and banged shut, then the garage door <b>slid</b> <b>open,</b> grating on the sill, and the car door again. The motor raced for the climb up into the garage and raced once more, explosively, before it was shut off. A final opening and {{slamming}} of the car door. Silence then, a horrible silence filled with waiting, till the leisurely Mr. Doppelbrau had examined the state of his tires and had at last shut the garage door. Instantly, for Babbitt, a blessed state of oblivion.|$|E
6000|$|One evening I {{went down}} to the {{railroad}} yards at Concord and found a freight train made up and ready to start. I located an empty box-car, <b>slid</b> <b>open</b> the side-door, and climbed in. It was my hope to win across to White River by morning; that would bring me into Vermont and not more than a thousand miles from Rutland. But after that, as I worked north, the distance between me and the point of danger would begin to increase. In the car I found a [...] "gay-cat," [...] who displayed unusual trepidation at my entrance. He took me for a [...] "shack" [...] (brakeman), and when he learned I was only a stiff, he began talking about the quarries at Rutland as the cause of the fright I had given him. He was a young country fellow, and had beaten his way only over local stretches of road.|$|E
60|$|There {{was another}} hoot of the whistle, a little station grew larger down the track, and {{here and there}} a wooden house peeped out amidst the slowly-flitting trees. Then the cars stopped with a jerk, and Miss Deringham stepped down from the platform. Her first glance showed her long ranks of {{climbing}} pines, with a great white peak silhouetted hard and sharp above them against the blue. Then she became conscious of the silver mist streaming ethereally athwart the sombre verdure from the river hollow, and that a new and pungent smell cut through the odours of dust and creosote which reeked along the track. It came from a cord of cedar-wood piled up close by, and she found it curiously refreshing. The drowsy roar of the river mingled with the panting of the locomotive pump, but there was a singular absence of life and movement in the station until the door of the baggage-car <b>slid</b> <b>open,</b> and her father sprang aside as her trunks were shot out on to the platform. A bag or two of something followed them, the great engines panted, and the dusty cars went on again, while it dawned upon Alice Deringham that her last hold upon civilization had gone, and she was left to her own resources in a new and somewhat barbarous land.|$|E
60|$|The {{elevator}} boy smiled knowingly to himself. When he {{took her}} up, he had noted the sparkle in her eyes, the color in her cheeks. His little cage had quite warmed with the glow of her repressed eagerness. And now, on the down trip, it was glacier-like. The sparkle and the color were gone. She was frowning, and what little he could see of her eyes was cold and steel-gray. Oh, he knew the symptoms, he did. He was an observer, and he knew it, too, and some day, when he was big enough, {{he was going to}} be a reporter, sure. And in the meantime he studied the procession of life as it streamed up and down eighteen sky-scraper floors in his elevator car. He <b>slid</b> the door <b>open</b> for her sympathetically and watched her trip determinedly out into the street.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The blaze {{was gone}} in a wink, but the whole schame came to me thin. I believe I was mad too.

Glory be, ut ripped out like a woman's dhriss when you tread on ut at a sergeants' ball, an' a bottle came with ut. I tuk the bottle an' the next minut I was out av the dhark av the pillar, the pink linin' wrapped round me most graceful, the music thunderin' like kettledrums, an' a could draft blowin' round my bare legs.

I knew my eyes were big, and my face was wax-white, an' at the worst I must ha' looked like a ghost. But they took me for the livin' god. The music stopped, and the women were dead dumb, an' I crooked my legs like a shepherd on a china basin, an' I did the ghost-waggle with my feet as I had done ut at the rig'mental theatre many times, an' I slid acrost the width av that temple in front av the she-god tootlin' on the beer bottle.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Westover {{understood}} from Whitwell's afterthought {{that it was}} Cynthia he {{was anxious}} to keep ignorant of his misgivings, if they were so much as misgivings. But {{the importance of this}} fact could not stay him against the tide of sleep which was bearing him down. When his head touched the pillow it swept over him, and he rose from it in the morning with a gayety of heart which he knew to be returning health. He jumped out of bed, and stuffed some shavings into his stove from the wood-box beside it, and laid some logs on them; he <b>slid</b> the damper <b>open,</b> and then lay down again, listening to the fire that showed its red teeth through the slats and roared and laughed to the day which sparkled on the white world without. When he got out of bed a second time, he found the room so hot that he had to pull down his window-sash, and he dressed in a temperature of twenty degrees below zero without knowing that the dry air was more than fresh. Mrs. Durgin called to him through the open door of her parlor, as he entered the dining-room: [...] "Cynthy will give you your breakfast, Mr. Westover. We're all done long ago, and I'm busy in here," [...] and the girl appeared with the coffee-pot and the dishes she had been keeping hot for him at the kitchen stove. She seemed to be going to leave him when she had put them down before him, but she faltered, and then she asked: [...] "Do you want I should pour your coffee for you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The freight {{got under}} way, and we {{lay down in}} {{one end of the}} box-car and went to sleep. Two or three hours afterward, at a stop, I was awakened by the noise of the {{right-hand}} door being softly <b>slid</b> <b>open.</b> The gay-cat slept on. I made no movement, though I veiled my eyes with my lashes to a little slit through which I could see out. A lantern was thrust in through the doorway, followed by the head of a shack. He discovered us, and looked at us for a moment. I was prepared for a violent expression on his part, or the customary [...] "Hit the grit, you son of a toad!" [...] Instead of this he cautiously withdrew the lantern and very, very softly slid the door to. This struck me as eminently unusual and suspicious. I listened, and softly I heard the hasp drop into place. The door was latched on the outside. We could not open it from the inside. One way of sudden exit from that car was blocked. It would never do. I waited a few seconds, then crept to the left-hand door and tried it. It was not yet latched. I opened it, dropped to the ground, and closed it behind me. Then I passed across the bumpers {{to the other side of}} the train. I opened the door the shack had latched, climbed in, and closed it behind me. Both exits were available again. The gay-cat was still asleep.|$|E
60|$|Several {{circumstances}} occurred {{immediately after}} this fit of Wyatt which contributed to heighten the curiosity with which I was already possessed. Among other things, this: I had been nervous--drank too much strong green tea, and slept ill at night--in fact, {{for two nights}} I could not be properly said to sleep at all. Now, my state-room opened into the main cabin, or dining-room, as did those of all the single men on board. Wyatt's three rooms were in the after-cabin, which was separated from the main one by a slight sliding door, never locked even at night. As we were almost constantly on a wind, and the breeze was not a little stiff, the ship heeled to leeward very considerably; and whenever her starboard side was to leeward, the sliding door between the cabins <b>slid</b> <b>open,</b> and so remained, nobody taking the trouble {{to get up and}} shut it. But my berth was in such a position, that when my own state-room door was open, as well as the sliding door in question (and my own door was always open on account of the heat,) I could see into the after-cabin quite distinctly, and just at that portion of it, too, where were situated the state-rooms of Mr. Wyatt. Well, during two nights (not consecutive) while I lay awake, I clearly saw Mrs. W., about eleven o'clock upon each night, steal cautiously from the state-room of Mr. W., and enter the extra room, where she remained until daybreak, when she was called by her husband and went back. That they were virtually separated was clear. They had separate apartments--no doubt in contemplation of a more permanent divorce; and here, after all I thought was the mystery of the extra state-room.|$|E
6000|$|André {{began his}} {{professional}} {{career as a}} waiter in a Bowery ten-cent eating-house. Had you seen him there you would have called him tough--to yourself. Not aloud, for he would have [...] "soaked" [...] you {{as quickly as he}} would have soaked his thumb in your coffee. He saved money and started a basement table d'hote in Eighth (or Ninth) Street. One afternoon André drank too much absinthe. He announced to his startled family that he was the Grand Llama of Thibet, therefore requiring an empty audience hall in which to be worshiped. He moved all the tables and chairs from the restaurant into the back yard, wrapped a red table-cloth around himself, and sat on a step-ladder for a throne. When the diners began to arrive, madame, in a flurry of despair, laid cloths and ushered them, trembling, outside. Between the tables clothes-lines were stretched, bearing the family wash. A party of Bohemia hunters greeted the artistic innovation with shrieks and acclamations of delight. That week's washing was not taken in for two years. When André came to his senses he had the menu printed on stiffly starched cuffs, and served the ices in little wooden tubs. Next he took down his sign and darkened the front of the house. When you went there to dine you fumbled for an electric button and pressed it. A lookout <b>slid</b> <b>open</b> a panel in the door, looked at you suspiciously, and asked if you were acquainted with Senator Herodotus Q. McMilligan, of the Chickasaw Nation. If you were, you were admitted and allowed to dine. If you were not, you were admitted and allowed to dine. There you have one of the abiding principles of Bohemia. When André had accumulated $20,000 he moved up-town, near Broadway, in the fierce light that beats upon the thrown-down. There we find him and leave him, with customers in pearls and automobile veils, striving to catch his excellently graduated nod of recognition.|$|E
40|$|As Sri Lanka <b>slid</b> {{back towards}} <b>open</b> {{hostilities}} in 2006, existing patterns {{of civil society}} engagement in peace negotiations came under widespread criticism {{on the grounds that}} they had failed to broaden participation and that they had largely excluded civil society organisations (CSOs) that were critical of peace efforts. As peace talks broke down, the need to move beyond a ‘charmed circle’ of Colombo-based peace NGOs and to engage with a ‘broader civil society’ became a perennial refrain from funding agencies. This period was also marked by an increasingly visible confrontation between pro-peace civil society and patriotic nationalist groups mobilising against peace negotiations and international engagement expressed through growing attacks on NGOs in the media and at a number of public events. This chapter explores this complex predicament facing civil society as Sri Lanka returned to war. First, it presents a brief summary of donors’ engagements with civil society during the ceasefire period and describes how the nature and scope of civil society peace work was shaped by the shifting political context. Second, it contrasts donor-backed peace efforts with the more robust campaigns of nationalist civil society groups after 2005. Third, it examines how the changing political climate impacted upon civil society peacebuilding efforts focusing in particular on the way in which pro-peace civil society actors managed the increasingly critical impressions of their work stemming from the domestic political arena. Drawing these strands together, the chapter concludes by reflecting on the collective timidity of civil society actors during the ceasefire period and argues that this was an outcome of two interconnecting sets of factors. On the one hand, civil society’s capacity to contribute to political transformation was constrained by its historical relations with the state. These patterns of interaction drove the dynamic relationship between two conflicting civil society arenas – patriotic groups fed off weaknesses in pro-peace civil society while the position of peace groups was further undermined by the success of these nationalist organizations. On the other hand, the approaches to peacebuilding pursued by donors during the ceasefire period encouraged a growing depoliticization and technicalization of civil society peace work which privileged a consensual rather than a politically engaged role for civil society actors. This analysis sees civil society organisations as confronted with a fundamental tension between a cosmopolitan view of politics that saw political change as the outcome of processes of governance reform prompted by extra-governmental actors and a local perception of politics that viewed political progress as a product of changes in government and debates conducted in an arena inhabited exclusively by political parties. Civil society’s efforts to build peace during the ceasefire period involved a perpetual balancing act between asserting liberal models of bottom-up change and reconciling these with an increasingly predominant and countervailing domestic vision of politics...|$|R
