5|$|By January 1974, a {{joint working}} party {{representing}} Greater Manchester had drawn up its county <b>Structure</b> <b>Plan,</b> ready for implementation by the Greater Manchester County Council. The plan set out objectives for the forthcoming metropolitan county. The highest priority was {{to increase the}} quality of life for its inhabitants by improving the county's physical environment and cultural facilities which had suffered following deindustrialisation—much of Greater Manchester's basic infrastructure dated from its 19th-century growth, and was unsuited to modern lifestyles. Other objectives were to reverse the trend of depopulation in central-Greater Manchester, to invest in country parks to improve the region's poor reputation on leisure facilities, and to improve the county's transport infrastructure and patterns.|$|E
5|$|The {{justification}} for the closure of Loring was that the Air Force had six more strategic bases than were needed to support the number of bomber and tanker aircraft in the Defense Department's <b>Structure</b> <b>Plan.</b> The base was evaluated against eight selection criteria {{and a large number}} of subelements specific to Air Force bases and missions. Even though Loring was in good condition and had strong community support, it ranked low in the criteria when compared to twenty other bases in the strategic category. One of the things that hurt Loring was its limited peacetime value as a tanker base, as well as its distance from bombing ranges. The commission did note that the facilities at Loring were above average, and the cost to close Loring would be low, the latter of which contributed to its closure.|$|E

40|$|In {{response}} {{to a lack of}} evaluative research into the application of the concept of sustainable development to development plans in England and Wales, an investigation is undertaken using the media of county council <b>structure</b> <b>plans.</b> A framework is devised for measuring the performance of <b>structure</b> <b>plans</b> against key themes and principles of sustainable development,relevant policy areas and procedures. The extent to which <b>structure</b> <b>plans</b> manage to make the concept operational is shown to be variable, with better performing plans illustrating a geographical and temporal bias. It is concluded that, whilst there is an awareness about sustainable development amongst county councils, the translation of this awareness into practice is, in many cases, proving difficult. ...|$|R

In 1976, he was {{appointed}} {{by the government to}} chair the Isle of Wight County <b>Structure</b> <b>Plan</b> Panel to consult the people of the Isle of Wight on the possible change of the county structure. Before the panel was formed, the Isle of Wight had been planned to be merged with Hampshire under the Local Government Act 1972, but the plan came to a halt when it met with much opposition from local residents. The panel led by Norman-Walker did not achieve any special breakthrough and it was in 1995 that the Isle of Wight finally became a unitary authority.|$|E
25|$|The idea of {{restoring}} the canal was first developed in 1975, {{as a result}} of legislation requiring planning authorities to produce county structure plans. The West Midlands <b>structure</b> <b>plan</b> included the concept of the restored canal as a linear park, and included a bypass to avoid the section destroyed by opencast mining. Further threats to the route from the proposed Birmingham Northern Relief Road {{led to the formation of}} the Ogley and Hatherton Restoration Society in 1989, after the Inland Waterways Association held a rally at Pelsall to highlight the plight of the canal. The Society later became the Lichfield and Hatherton Canals Restoration Trust, while the relief road became the M6 Toll motorway.|$|E
25|$|Reducing the {{mobilization}} {{strength of the}} army to 120,000 under the New Army <b>Structure</b> <b>plan</b> is to be accomplished in part by limiting initial training of recruits to six months, followed by reducing the period allotted for refresher training from twenty years to ten years. Each reservist is to receive training over a twelve-day period every second year during his first ten years of reserve duty, generally not extending beyond the time he reaches his mid-thirties. The reduced need for conscripts corresponds to a lower pool of young men because of a declining birth rate. The availability of about 40,000 fit trainees annually in 1993 was expected to fall to barely 30,000 by 2000 and to 26,000 by 2015.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{fundamentals}} of therapy planning in complex dynamic technological systems. Therapy plans (plans, for short) are introduced via several concepts of hierarchical graph structures. There are investigated hierarchically <b>structured</b> families of <b>plans</b> as collections of pin graphs, rooted families of <b>plans,</b> hierarchically <b>structured</b> <b>plans,</b> and plans itself. Basic properties are characterized via properties of rewrite relations. For instance, plans are normal forms of hierarchically <b>structured</b> <b>plans</b> {{with respect to}} some rewrite relation based on an underlying collection of pin graphs. Restricted to sequential plans, the languages of plans specifiable {{turn out to be}} context-free. The approach allows to carefully distinguish between plans to be executed and plans to be revised.

25|$|Work on all {{buildings}} {{was postponed}} in May 1927. On May 6, {{an ad hoc}} committee composed of Olmsted; Medary; Charles Moore, chair of the Commission on Fine Arts; and Louis E. Simon, Supervising Architect of the U.S. Treasury, recommended relocating the Justice building from 15th Street NW to a lot further east so that traffic congestion at 15th and Pennsylvania might be alleviated. This ad hoc committee met again three days later to not only consider the Justice building relocation but also to consider a plan to create a single building ringing Federal Triangle rather than six to eight individual structures. The Public Buildings Commission considered the same plan on May 16. The Commission on Fine Arts approved relocating the Justice building the following day. However, disagreements among the three planning bodies proved so fundamental that a new Board of Architectural Consultants was created on May 19, 1927, to advise the groups {{on the development of}} Federal Triangle. The Board consisted of the Supervising Architect of the U.S. Treasury (Louis E. Simon) and six private architects, including Louis Ayres, Edward H. Bennett, Arthur Brown, Jr., William Adams Delano, Milton Bennett Medary, and John Russell Pope. The Board of Architectural Consultants first met on May 23, at which time it considered a plan to create a single building ringing Federal Triangle rather than six to eight individual structures. As the Board of Architectural Consultants began its deliberations, the Commission on Fine Arts approved a plan to locate the Justice building {{on the north side of}} B Street NW between 7th and 9th Streets NW (where Center Market stood). About two weeks later, the Public Buildings Commission approved the single <b>structure</b> <b>plan.</b> This plan envisioned a central plaza (defined by 13th, 14th, B, and D Streets NW) surrounded by a traffic circle, with the buildings lining the exterior of the traffic circle. Few streets would be closed; rather, arches would connect each building to its neighbors (with only 12th Street NW remaining unbridged).|$|E
500|$|The {{subsequent}} {{local government}} restructuring in April 2009, which abolished more two-tier counties (including Shropshire and Cheshire) {{did not affect}} Worcestershire. The county still maintains a two-tier administrative system as per the Local Government Act 1992, although Lord Heseltine's No stone unturned: in pursuit of growth review for the Department of Business, Innovation & Skills suggested that all English local authorities should be unitary or combined authority models similar to the existing structures in Scotland and Wales. As of 2014, conversations are taking place within the local media about the positives and negatives of a possible unitary council structure within Worcestershire. Possibilities being put forward in these discussions are broadly similar to the Local Government Boundary Commission for England proposals prior to the 'Hereford & Worcester' abolition. These ideas consist of either two unitary authorities based in North Worcestershire (Bromsgrove, Redditch, Wyre Forest) and South Worcestershire (Malvern Hills, Worcester, Wychavon) or a single countywide council as per Herefordshire. Already the three district councils {{in the south of}} the county have successfully worked together to produce the South Worcestershire Development Plan, which replaced the existing Local Plans of these three partner councils when it was adopted in February 2016; it also superseded elements of Worcestershire County Council's County <b>Structure</b> <b>Plan.</b> There are also joint service provisions between the North Worcestershire districts including building control shared services, economic ...|$|E
