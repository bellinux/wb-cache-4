40|$|Abstract:- In {{this paper}} a {{mathematical}} model of the hip joint is developed to calculate the contact <b>stresses</b> <b>in</b> artificial hip joint. The <b>stresses</b> <b>in</b> any joint play {{important role in the}} restoration of the joint after surgery. Mathematical modelling is a non invasive method of determining <b>stresses</b> <b>in</b> the hip joint. The contact <b>stresses</b> <b>in</b> the artificial hip joint are predicted using Hertz contact stress theory. The high value of contact <b>stresses</b> <b>in</b> UHMWPE cup increases the wear. It was found that the radius of femoral head has significant influence on the peak contact <b>stresses</b> <b>in</b> the acetabular cavity. In addition to femur head dimensions, polymeric cup thickness and clearance are the important factors that affect the contact <b>stresses</b> <b>in</b> human hip joint.

5|$|Given {{the role}} of {{mitochondria}} as the cell's powerhouse, {{there may be some}} leakage of the high-energy electrons in the respiratory chain to form reactive oxygen species. This was thought to result in significant oxidative <b>stress</b> <b>in</b> the mitochondria with high mutation rates of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Hypothesized links between aging and oxidative stress are not new and were proposed in 1956, which was later refined into the mitochondrial free radical theory of aging. A vicious cycle was thought to occur, as oxidative stress leads to mitochondrial DNA mutations, which can lead to enzymatic abnormalities and further oxidative stress.|$|E

Besides experimental methods of residual stress measurements numerical methods of welding simulation are an important tool to determine the whole residual <b>stress</b> field <b>in</b> a component {{as a basis for}} lifetime prediction.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Several models {{exist for}} {{predicting}} residual thermal <b>stresses</b> <b>in</b> inorganic glasses.

In infants and the cognitively impaired, the disease has normally been attributed to over-stimulation and under-stimulation from parents and caregivers, causing the individual to seek self-gratification and self-stimulus due to the lack or abundance of external stimuli.

5|$|While {{antioxidant}} supplementation {{is widely}} used in attempts to prevent the development of cancer, antioxidants may interfere with cancer treatments, since the environment of cancer cells causes high levels of oxidative stress, making these cells more susceptible to the further oxidative stress induced by treatments.

On the other hand, other reviews have suggested that antioxidants could reduce side effects or increase survival times.|$|E

5|$|The first temperature-sensitive RNA element was {{reported}} in 1989. Prior to this research, mutations upstream from the transcription start site in a lambda (λ) phage cIII mRNA were found to affect the level of translation of the cIII protein. This protein is involved in selection of either a lytic or lysogenic life cycle in λ phage, with high concentrations of cIII promoting lysogeny. Further study of this upstream RNA region identified two alternative secondary structures; experimental study found the structures to be interchangeable, and dependent on both magnesium ion concentration and temperature. This RNA thermometer is now thought to encourage entry to a lytic cycle under heat <b>stress</b> <b>in</b> order for the bacteriophage to rapidly replicate and escape the host cell.|$|E
5|$|The {{glutathione}} system includes glutathione, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidases, and glutathione S-transferases. This {{system is}} found in animals, plants and microorganisms. Glutathione peroxidase is an enzyme containing four selenium-cofactors that catalyzes the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides. There are at least four different glutathione peroxidase isozymes in animals. Glutathione peroxidase 1 is the most abundant and is a very efficient scavenger of hydrogen peroxide, while glutathione peroxidase 4 is most active with lipid hydroperoxides. Surprisingly, glutathione peroxidase 1 is dispensable, as mice lacking this enzyme have normal lifespans, but they are hypersensitive to induced oxidative <b>stress.</b> <b>In</b> addition, the glutathione S-transferases show high activity with lipid peroxides. These enzymes are at particularly high levels in the liver and also serve in detoxification metabolism.|$|E
