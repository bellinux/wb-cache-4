50|$|In {{order to}} be most {{effective}} in terms of heat transfer, <b>spray</b> <b>ponds</b> should always be oriented with their longer sides at right angles to the direction of the prevailing wind.

50|$|A <b>spray</b> <b>pond</b> is a {{reservoir}} in which warmed water (e.g. from a power plant) is cooled before reuse. This {{is done by}} spraying the warm water with nozzles into the cooler air, where cooling takes place by exchange of heat with the ambient air, involving both conductive heat transfer between the water droplets and the surrounding air and evaporative cooling (which provides by far the greatest portion, typically 85 to 90%, of the total cooling). The primary purpose of <b>spray</b> <b>pond</b> design is thus to ensure an adequate degree of contacting between the hot injection water and the ambient air, so as to facilitate the process of heat transfer.|$|E
50|$|The {{height of}} each spray nozzle {{above the surface}} of the pond should be between 1.5 m and 2.0 m. The spray nozzles {{themselves}} should be chosen so as to provide the desired spray pattern diameter at the pond surface, while yielding a maximum spray height of 2.5 m or more above the nozzle. This will provide an adequate contact time between the air and water and should be achievable with a delivery pressure of between 50 and 75 kPa across the nozzles. The performance of a <b>spray</b> <b>pond</b> depends to a large degree on the effectiveness of the spray nozzles which are installed. Ideally, the chosen nozzles should provide a fine, evenly distributed spray in conical form, be capable of passing small particles of suspended matter without blocking and be readily dismantled for cleaning. Typical droplet sizes which are achieved by <b>spray</b> <b>pond</b> nozzles vary between 3 mm and 6 mm. While providing better cooling performance because of their increased surface-to-volume ratios, the generation of droplets of smaller size would require an excessive pressure drop across the nozzles and could lead to increased wind-drift losses from the pond.|$|E

50|$|The thermal {{efficiency}} of a <b>spray</b> <b>pond</b> may be calculated {{based on its}} approach to the saturation (wet bulb) temperature of the air: (TH - TC) / (TH - TW), where the subscripts H and C refer to the temperatures of the hot and cold water streams, while the subscript W refers to the wet bulb temperature of the air.

50|$|Specific <b>spray</b> <b>pond</b> surface areas tend {{to range}} between 1.2 and 1.7 m2 per m3/h {{of water to}} be cooled. The width chosen for a drift channel around the active zone of the pond (containing the sprays) is {{dependent}} {{on a number of}} factors, including the prevailing wind strength, the average size of the spray droplets produced by the nozzles and the presence of any nearby structures which may be sensitive to fogging or water drift, such as roads, houses, etc. Drift channel widths between 3 and 4 m are typically recommended.|$|E

40|$|A data {{acquisition}} research program, entitled "Ultimate Heat Sink Performance Field Experiments," {{has been brought}} to completion. The primary objective is to obtain the requisite data to characterize thermal performance and water utilization for cooling <b>ponds</b> and <b>spray</b> <b>ponds</b> at elevated temperature. Such data are useful for modeling purposes, but the work reported here does not contain modeling efforts within its scope. The water bodies which have been studied are indicative of nuclear reactor ultimate heat sinks, components of emergency core cooling systems. The data reflect thermal performance and water utilization for meteorological and solar influences which are representative of worst-case combinations of conditions. Constructed water retention ponds, provided with absolute seals against seepage, have been chosen as facilities for the measurement programs; the first pond was located at Raft River, Idaho, and the second at East Mesa, California.

40|$|Process {{waste heat}} in large power {{generation}} plants is commonly rejected to lakes or rivers, {{or through the}} use of cooling towers. Although these waste heat rejection methods are effective, they may not be feasible in every application due to cost considerations or geographic location. Moreover, it is desirable to put some of the waste heat to good use, both from the standpoint of improved plant efficiency as well as reduced environmental impact. An analysis of alternative methods of power plant waste heat rejection is presented here as applied to a coal-fired power generation facility in the Midwestern United States. Five approaches for rejecting or recovering the waste heat are considered: cooling canals, open-water algae bioreactors, wintertime greenhouse heating, <b>spray</b> <b>ponds,</b> and modified solar updraft towers. Each of the five technologies can be sized for the needs and operating conditions of a given power plant. The quantitative analysis tools developed in this work are validated by benchmarking against published results. Three of the alternative methods generate secondary benefits: the algae bioreactor, greenhouse heating, and the modified solar updraft tower produce biodiesel, extended periods for horticulture, and electric power, respectively. The land area required to reject 1. 16 GW of heat (the condenser heat rejection from a 500 MWplant operating at 30 % thermal efficiency) using each of the alternative technologies is compared.

Although these waste heat rejection methods are quite effective, they may not be feasible in every application due to cost considerations or geographic location. Moreover, it is desirable to use the waste heat in additional processes, if possible, both from the standpoint of improved plant efficiency as well as reduced environmental impact. A comprehensive analysis of alternative methods of power plant waste heat rejection is presented here. Six approaches for rejecting or recovering the waste heat are considered: cooling canals, open-water algae bioreactors, wintertime greenhouse heating, <b>spray</b> <b>ponds,</b> modified solar towers, and updraft towers with heat exchangers. Each of the six technologies can be sized for the needs and operating conditions of a given power plant. The quantitative analysis tools developed in this work are validated by benchmarking against published results. Four of the alternative methods generate secondary benefits: the algae bioreactor, greenhouse heating, the modified solar tower, and the updraft tower with a heat exchanger produce biodiesel, extended periods of horticulture, and electric power, respectively. ^ The Hoosier Energy power plant in Merom, Indiana is used as a case study for each alternative method of waste heat rejection. Each technology is designed to reject 332 MW of waste heat from the Merom plant. This heat rejection load is selected for the comparison as it represents the amount needed to lower the temperature of the waste water issuing from the power plant by 5 degrees Fahrenheit, a goal determined by Hoosier Energy to maintain a healthy habitat for the aquatic species residing in the reservoir. A comparison of the land footprint required to reject the 332 MW of heat using each of the alternative technologies is discussed. The sensitivity of the sizing of the different technologies to changes in the environmental and geometric parameters is quantified.

40|$|In {{the present}} study we present a {{population}} model (Metapopulation model for Assessing Spatial and Temporal Effects of Pesticides [MASTEP]) describing the effects on and recovery of the waterlouse Asellus aquaticus after exposure to a fast-acting, nonpersistent insecticide {{as a result of}} <b>spray</b> drift in <b>pond,</b> ditch, and stream scenarios. The model used the spatial and temporal distribution of the exposure in different treatment conditions as an input parameter. A doseÂ¿response relation derived from a hypothetical mesocosm study was used to link the exposure with the effects. The modeled landscape was represented as a lattice of 1 - by 1 -m cells. The model included processes of mortality of A. aquaticus, life history, random walk between cells, density dependence of population regulation, and, {{in the case of the}} stream scenario, medium-distance drift of A. aquaticus due to flow. All parameter estimates were based on expert judgment and the results of a thorough review of published information on the ecology of A. aquaticus. In the treated part of the water body, the ditch scenario proved to be the worst-case situation, due to the absence of drift of A. aquaticus. Effects in the pond scenario were smaller because the pond was exposed from one side, allowing migration from the other, less contaminated side. The results of the stream scenario showed the importance of including drift for the population recovery in the 100 -m stretch of the stream that was treated. It should be noted, however, that the inclusion of drift had a negligible impact on numbers in the stream as a whole (600 m) ...|$|R
40|$|A thermal {{pollution}} abatement model for power plant siting is formulated {{to evaluate the}} economic costs, resource requirements, and physical characteristics of a particular {{thermal pollution}} abatement technology at a given site type for a plant alternative.

The thermal pollution evaluation model analyzes the abatement technologies of surface discharge, diffuser, cooling <b>pond,</b> <b>spray</b> canal, and wet mechanical draft cooling towers. The typical site types evaluated are a river, small lake, great lake, coastal, estuary, offshore ocean, and water poor site. The model will be used in conjunction with a Plant Evaluation Model, which analyzes the effects of fuel costs and air pollution abatement, a Plant Expansion Model, and a Generation Expansion Model to determine the optimal operating and generating plan for an electric utility. The model may also be used in conjunction with the Plant Evaluation Model to evaluate the trade offs between the dollar cost of electric power generation, reliability, and air and thermal pollution. The model may also be used to determine, for a single plant site alternative, which abatement technologies would be feasible, and to make an economic and resource requirement comparison between these alternatives.

40|$|Predation {{rates of}} {{freshwater}} turtle nests can vary markedly, suggesting {{that in addition}} to different suites of predators present, environmental factors (e. g. vegetation characteristics, distance to water/clearing and rainfall) also influence survival of turtle nests. Understanding the influence of environmental factors on nest success can aid turtle conservation through successful management of nesting habitat. This study simultaneously investigated the effect of multiple factors on artificial nest survivorship at a site where oblong turtles Chelodina colliei were present. Over a 12 -month period, we monitored the fate of 580 artificial nests installed as 145 nest-sets, each having one of four treatments: (1) two chicken eggs (E) buried and the ground sprayed with water from a turtle pond (S) (E+S+), (2) two chicken eggs (E+S-), (3) nest sprayed (E-S+) and (4) hole dug and refilled (E-S-). Seven environmental factors were recorded for each site and nests. Nests were monitored for 2 months after installation, by which time, 46 % of the nests had been excavated. Depredation rate was affected by both the presence of eggs (P< 0. 001) and being <b>sprayed</b> with turtle <b>pond</b> water (P= 0. 005); but we found that even 38 % of empty nests (holes simply dug and refilled) were excavated.
