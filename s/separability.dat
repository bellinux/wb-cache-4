5|$|Although less used, the <b>separability</b> {{assumption}} is considered more general because every stochastic process has a separable version. It {{is also used}} {{when it is not}} possible to construct a stochastic process in a Skorokhod space. For example, <b>separability</b> is assumed when constructing and studying random fields, where the collection of random variables is now indexed by sets other than the real line such as -dimensional Euclidean space.|$|E
5|$|The {{definition}} of <b>separability</b> {{can also be}} stated for other index sets and state spaces, {{such as in the}} case of random fields, where the index set as well as the state space can be -dimensional Euclidean space.|$|E
5|$|Another {{approach}} is possible, originally developed by Anatoliy Skorokhod and Andrei Kolmogorov, for a continuous-time stochastic process with any metric space as its state space. For {{the construction of}} such a stochastic process, {{it is assumed that}} the sample functions of the stochastic process belong to some suitable function space, which is usually the Skorokhod space consisting of all right-continuous functions with left limits. This {{approach is}} now more used than the <b>separability</b> assumption, but such a stochastic process based on this approach will be automatically separable.|$|E
25|$|Contrast <b>separability</b> {{with the}} related notion of second countability, {{which is in}} general {{stronger}} but equivalent on the class of metrizable spaces.|$|E

25|$|The <b>separability</b> of {{the metric}} space {{is needed to}} make sure that for M-valued, {{measurable}} functions f and g, the distance d(f(x),nbsp&g(x)) is again a measurable real-valued function of x.|$|E
25|$|A metric {{space is}} {{separable}} space {{if it has}} a countable dense subset. Typical examples are the real numbers or any Euclidean space. For metric spaces (but not for general topological spaces) <b>separability</b> is equivalent to second-countability and also to the Lindelöf property.|$|E
25|$|In {{case the}} wave {{function}} {{of two or}} more particles is separable, then the system's total quantum potential becomes the sum of the quantum potentials of the two particles. Exact <b>separability</b> is extremely unphysical given that interactions between the system and its environment destroy the factorization; however, a wave function that is a superposition of several wave functions of approximately disjoint support will factorize approximately.|$|E
25|$|<b>Separability</b> is {{especially}} important in numerical analysis and constructive mathematics, since many theorems that can be proved for nonseparable spaces have constructive proofs only for separable spaces. Such constructive proofs {{can be turned into}} algorithms for use in numerical analysis, and they are the only sorts of proofs acceptable in constructive analysis. A famous example of a theorem of this sort is the Hahn–Banach theorem.|$|E
25|$|Defenders of the {{decision}} and <b>separability</b> have {{said that it is}} necessary for arbitration clauses to have any force, otherwise parties would be able to avoid them too easily by filing suits on any number of grounds. Those whose practice involves arbitrating disputes that are international in scope have credited it with bringing U.S. arbitration law closer to European norms, helping American companies compete and making the U.S. a viable venue for arbitration.|$|E
25|$|In {{subsequent}} cases {{concerning the}} FAA, the Court has reaffirmed the <b>separability</b> principle and {{held that the}} FAA and this reading of it apply to arbitrable contracts under state law, even {{in cases where the}} contract is alleged to be illegal or state law provides for administrative dispute resolution. This has been seen as expanding the use of arbitration in contracts in the later 20th century, not only those between businesses but between businesses and consumers as well.|$|E
25|$|TOT {{states should}} be {{separated}} from FOK (feeling of knowing) states. FOK, in contrast, is the feeling that one {{will be able to}} recognize - from a list of items - an item that is currently inaccessible. There are still currently opposing articles of the <b>separability</b> of the process underlying these concepts. However, {{there is some evidence that}} TOTs and FOKs draw on different parts of the brain. TOTs are associated with the anterior cingulate, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and right inferior cortex while FOKs are not.|$|E
25|$|In several papers, Alan Scott Rau of the University of Texas {{law school}} {{has gone to}} a greater extent than Fortas did in {{grounding}} Prima Paint and the <b>separability</b> doctrine. He notes that challenges to the arbitration clause are often inseparable from the underlying claim, and that some public policy objectives may be better served by allowing the case to be heard by an arbitrator first. Conversely, he also notes that some challenges to a contract's formation necessarily include a challenge to the arbitration clause in any event, contrary to some recent lower-court decisions.|$|E
25|$|Spatial {{multiplexing}} requires MIMO antenna configuration. In spatial multiplexing, a high-rate {{signal is}} split into multiple lower-rate streams and each stream {{is transmitted from}} a different transmit antenna in the same frequency channel. If these signals arrive at the receiver antenna array with sufficiently different spatial signatures and the receiver has accurate CSI, it can separate these streams into (almost) parallel channels. Spatial multiplexing {{is a very powerful}} technique for increasing channel capacity at higher signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). The maximum number of spatial streams is limited by the lesser of the number of antennas at the transmitter or receiver. Spatial multiplexing can be used without CSI at the transmitter, but can be combined with precoding if CSI is available. Spatial multiplexing can also be used for simultaneous transmission to multiple receivers, known as space-division multiple access or multi-user MIMO, in which case CSI is required at the transmitter. The scheduling of receivers with different spatial signatures allows good <b>separability.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} <b>separability</b> of a {{stochastic}} process {{was introduced by}} Joseph Doob, where the underlying idea {{is to make a}} countable set of points of the index set determine the properties of the stochastic process. [...] Any stochastic process with a countable index set already meets the <b>separability</b> conditions, so discrete-time stochastic processes are always separable. A theorem by Doob, sometimes known as Doob's <b>separability</b> theorem, says that any real-valued continuous-time stochastic process has a separable modification. Versions of this theorem also exist for more general stochastic processes with index sets and state spaces other than the real line.|$|E
500|$|<b>Separability</b> is a {{property}} of a stochastic process {{based on its}} index set {{in relation to the}} [...] probability measure. The property is assumed so that functionals of stochastic processes or random fields with uncountable index sets can form random variables. For a stochastic process to be separable, in addition to other conditions, its index set must be a separable space, which means that the index set has a dense countable subset.|$|E
500|$|Ekeland's {{analysis}} {{explained the}} success of methods of convexminimization on large and separable problems, despite the non-convexities of the summand functions. Ekeland and later authors argued that additive <b>separability</b> produced an approximately convex aggregate problem, even though the summand functions were non-convex. The crucial step in these publications {{is the use of}} the [...] Shapley–Folkman lemma. The [...] Shapley–Folkman lemma has encouraged the use of methods of convex minimization on other applications with sums of many functions.|$|E
500|$|One {{approach}} for avoiding construction difficulties, proposed by Joseph Doob, is {{to assume that}} the stochastic process is separable. <b>Separability</b> ensures that infinite-dimensional distributions [...] determine the properties of [...] sample functions by requiring that sample functions are essentially determined by their values on a dense countable set of points in the index set. Furthermore, if a stochastic process [...] is separable, then functionals of an uncountable number of points of the index set are measurable and their probabilities can be studied.|$|E
2500|$|Richard Reuben of Missouri law school, a {{longtime}} critic of mandatory arbitration, calls Prima Paints {{adoption of the}} <b>separability</b> doctrine [...] "a perhaps unparalleled display of judicial sophistry".

2500|$|Those who {{approached}} from a consumer-rights standpoint {{were not as}} solicitous. Texas arbitration expert Alan Scott Rau called Scalia's phrasing [...] "sloppy and unguarded", noting it failed to recognize that some challenges to a contract that the law reserves for courts, such as capacity and forgery, necessarily include the arbitration clause. Stephen Ware of Kansas calls on Congress to repeal the <b>separability</b> doctrine and require that courts be permitted to compel arbitration only after they have heard and rejected any challenges to {{the validity of the}} contract itself: [...] "The <b>separability</b> doctrine separates arbitration law from an important part of contract law — the defenses to enforcement — and thus fails to provide the right to litigate with the protection of those defenses." ...|$|E
2500|$|In general, {{finding out}} whether or not a mixed state is {{entangled}} is considered difficult. The general bipartite case {{has been shown to be}} NP-hard. For the [...] and [...] cases, a necessary and sufficient criterion for <b>separability</b> is given by the famous Positive Partial Transpose (PPT) condition.|$|E
2500|$|Systems {{which contain}} no {{entanglement}} {{are said to}} be separable. For 2-Qubit and Qubit-Qutrit systems (2×2 and 2×3 respectively) the simple Peres–Horodecki criterion provides both a necessary and a sufficient criterion for <b>separability,</b> and thus for detecting entanglement. However, for the general case, the criterion is merely a sufficient one for <b>separability,</b> as the problem becomes NP-hard. A numerical approach to the problem is suggested by Jon Magne Leinaas, Jan Myrheim and Eirik Ovrum in their paper [...] "Geometrical aspects of entanglement". Leinaas et al. offer a numerical approach, iteratively refining an estimated separable state towards the target state to be tested, and checking if the target state can indeed be reached.

2500|$|Most such lenders {{had their}} {{customers}} sign credit agreements that included arbitration clauses specifying that all disputes {{were to be}} resolved through that process rather than litigation.

Lawsuits over these contracts, however, were increasingly dismissed by lower courts that followed the Supreme Court's [...] Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg. Co. case, which created the <b>separability</b> doctrine, under which all issues in contracts with arbitration clauses, save the clause itself, were to be decided by the arbitrator and not a court, under the 1925 Federal Arbitration Act. In Southland Corp. v. Keating, the Court held the FAA, and thus the <b>separability</b> doctrine, applicable to contracts executed under state law as well.|$|E

2500|$|Like {{the other}} axioms of countability, <b>separability</b> is a [...] "limitation on size", not {{necessarily}} in terms of cardinality (though, {{in the presence of}} the Hausdorff axiom, this does turn out to be the case; see below) but in a more subtle topological sense. [...] In particular, every continuous function on a separable space whose image is a subset of a Hausdorff space is determined by its values on the countable dense subset.|$|E
2500|$|Proponents of {{arbitration}} {{and other}} means of alternative dispute resolution {{have seen in the}} decision a reassuring reaffirmation of the <b>separability</b> principle that cleared up whether it covered a challenge to the legality of the underlying contract.

[...] The decision left open the question of whether it was still for the courts to decide if a contract had been properly formed, however, and some lower courts had denied motions to compel arbitration when that was the issue.

He called this argument [...] "tortured", since neither was actually incorporated into the sales procedure agreement as Soler claimed.
