40|$|ABSTRACT: Nature {{provides}} {{a vast array}} of solid materials that repeatedly and reversibly transform in shape in response to environmental variations. This property is essential, for example, for new energy-saving technologies, efficient collection of <b>solar</b> <b>radiation,</b> and thermal <b>management.</b> Here we report a similar shape-morphing mechanism using differential swelling of hydro-philic polyelectrolyte multilayer inkjets deposited on an LBL carbon nanotube (CNT) composite. The out-of-plane deflection can be precisely controlled, as predicted by theoretical analysis. We also demonstrate a controlled and stimuli-responsive twisting motion on a spiral-shaped LBL nanocomposite. By mimicking the motions achieved in nature, this method offers new opportunities for the design and fabrication of functional stimuli-responsive shape-morphing nanoscale and microscale structures for a variety of applications...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{order to}} improve our {{understanding}} of habitat preferences and optimal management of open woodland in-sects, we analyse patch occupancy and oviposition electivity of the endangered Duke of Burgundy butterfly, Hamearis lucina, in three regions across German habitat types. Some newly available forest clearings created by a severe winter storm in the Schönbuch region were colonised within 2 years, whereas some suitable patches remained unoccupied for several years. We discuss how small population sizes, limited patch connectivity, and habitat quality may contribute to such an intermediate colonisation power. Across study regions, we document differences in oviposition site elec-tivity. On calcareous grassland in the Diemeltal, shaded Primula plants on western slopes were preferentially used, probably to avoid desiccation of the natal food plant. To the contrary, sun-exposed Primula stands were preferred in forest clearings in the Schönbuch and calcareous fens in the Allgäu. In these regions, the risk of desiccation is low, but the overall cool and moist microclimate conditions may hamper larval development in shaded conditions, favouring oviposition at sites with maximum exposition to <b>solar</b> <b>radiation.</b> Optimal <b>management</b> strategies depend on the abiotic and biotic conditions and conservation priorities for the given region and habitat type, and we suggest manage-ment regimes that promise to sustain suitable H. lucina habitat at a landscape-level...|$|R

However, models focusing on <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> in relation to giant panda habitat and seasonal distribution are limited. The research aims to form spatial models of 12 month <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> patterns and to investigate {{the relation between the}} <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> patterns and the monthly distribution patterns of giant pandas. The <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> model of Kumar et al. was adopted for this study in Foping Nature Reserve (NR), China. By comparing twelve monthly <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> patterns and calculating statistics such as maximum, minimum, mean and standard deviation of the <b>solar</b> <b>radiation,</b> diversified <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> patterns over different months were obtained. Maximum <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> occurred in June and July, while minimum <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> occurred in December and January. The annual sum of <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> was 6954 MJ/m 2 in Foping NR. The range in <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> was smaller in hot months and larger in cold months. Radio tracking data of giant pandas were collected for twelve months and the ensuing maps were overlaid with the twelve-month <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> map to analyze the relation between the giant panda's monthly distribution and <b>solar</b> <b>radiation.</b> Our results showed that giant pandas prefer areas with lower <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> in warm months and select areas with higher <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> in cold months, which illustrates that the distribution of giant pandas is indeed affected by <b>solar</b> <b>radiation.</b> To a certain degree, it also explains the behavior of seasonal movement by giant pandas in Foping NR...|$|R

2500|$|Climate {{engineering}} {{opens up}} various {{political and economic}} issues. The governance issues characterizing carbon dioxide removal compared to <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> <b>management</b> tend to be distinct. Carbon dioxide removal techniques are typically slow to act, expensive, and entail risks that are relatively familiar, such as the risk of carbon dioxide leakage from underground storage formations. In contrast, <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> <b>management</b> methods are fast-acting, comparatively cheap, and involve novel and more significant risks such as regional climate disruptions. As {{a result of these}} differing characteristics, the key governance problem for carbon dioxide removal (as with emissions reductions) is making sure actors do enough of it (the so-called [...] "free rider problem"), whereas the key governance issue for <b>solar</b> <b>radiation</b> <b>management</b> is making sure actors do not do too much (the [...] "free driver" [...] problem).|$|E
