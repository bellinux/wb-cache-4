5000|$|M1899 Carbine, {{generally}} {{the same as}} the M1898 Carbine, but with a slightly longer forearm and hand guard, and without the <b>swivel</b> <b>ring.</b> Most of the M1898 carbines were arsenal reconditioned to the Model 1899 configuration and fitted with windage-adjustable rear sights.|$|E
50|$|Scarabs (beetles) were {{produced}} in vast numbers for many centuries and many thousands have survived. They were generally {{intended to be}} worn or carried by the living. They were typically carved or moulded {{in the form of}} a scarab beetle (usually identified as Scarabaeus sacer) with varying degrees of naturalism but usually at least indicating the head, wing case and legs but with a flat base. The base was usually inscribed with designs and/or hieroglyphs to form an impression seal. Scarabs were usually drilled from end to end to allow them to be strung on a thread or incorporated into a <b>swivel</b> <b>ring.</b> The most common of sizes for scarabs is from 6mm to 4 cm (length) and most are probably between 1 cm and 2 cm long. Larger scarabs were made from time to time for particular purposes (such as the commemorative scarabs of Amenhotep III). Heart scarabs (typically 5 cm to 9 cm long, made of dark hardstone and not pierced for suspension) were made for a specific funerary purpose and should be considered separately.|$|E
6000|$|... 6.Handle of small-sized hunting-knife. Blade snapped short. Buck's horn, diamond cut, with <b>swivel</b> and <b>ring</b> on the butt; {{fragment}} of cotton cord attached.|$|R
25|$|Tackle that is {{attached}} {{to the end of a}} fishing line is called terminal tackle. This includes hooks, sinkers, floats, leaders, <b>swivels,</b> split <b>rings</b> and wire, snaps, beads, spoons, blades, spinners and clevises to attach spinner blades to fishing lures.|$|R
5000|$|Drovers’ or grazing hobbles have a buckle {{on a wide}} double redhide or chrome {{leather strap}} and a <b>swivel</b> and 5 <b>ring</b> chain {{connecting}} them. They are placed around the pasterns.|$|R
50|$|The {{portrait}} is a garnet intaglio of circa 220 BC. It is {{set into}} an original elaborate gold <b>swivel</b> <b>ring.</b> The {{work can be}} confidently dated as it is signed by engraver Apollonios (ΑΠΟΛΛΩΝΙΟor Υ), who also carved and signed {{a portrait of a}} very young Antiochus III (also called Antiochus the Great, ruled Seleucid Empire in 222-187 BC). Apollonios might have also been responsible for making coin dies for Antiochus III, as some of his coins bear monogram ΑΠΟ, although this is controversial. Several seal impressions — one of Antiochus III, one of Antiochus IV, and six of an unknown nobleman — excavated in Seleucia on the Tigris in modern Iraq, all unsigned, have been ascribed to Apollonios or his circle on stylistic grounds. Influence of his work has been deduced in coins of Antiochus III minted in Antiokheia. Apollonios was certainly an engraver of the first rank, but nothing else is known about him as his is a very common name. He has been hypothesized to be an Athenian who worked for some time in the Seleucid and possibly other Hellenistic courts.|$|E
40|$|Finite element and {{photoelastic}} {{methods of}} stress analysis have been wed {{to study the}} effects of pressure loading on the behaviour of <b>swivel</b> <b>ring</b> flanges. The use of recesses on the back faces of flanges, to control the load position, were investigated. The effect of the friction conditions between the flange and ring were also considered. It was found that the inclusion of a recess can significantly reduce the highest stresses, which occur in the flange/hub fillet radius. The friction conditions between the flange and ring were also found to {{have a significant effect on}} the stresses. ...|$|E
30|$|Most of the non-weld {{connectors}} are {{supplied by}} offshore oil-gas service companies from America and Europe, such as Oil states industries Inc, Cameron, FMC Technologies, Oceaneering International Inc, Quality Connector LLC and Hydratight. Static metal seal based Connectors include tapping connector and method of using same [5], <b>swivel</b> <b>ring</b> flange, external hydraulic tieback connector [6], subsea tool for tie in of pipeline ends [7] and adapter sleeve for wellhead housing [8]. Rubber sealed connectors include pipeline joint [9], over 2000 morgrip connector and coupling device [10]. The other connectors with metal and rubber seal include griplock end connector, smart flange plus connector, quick flange morgrip pipeline connector and hydraulic smart flange connector. The above typical connectors are reliable to connect subsea pipelines, but their design is too complicated. Too many bolts {{have to be}} pre-tightened and operation tools have {{to be used for}} connection, which result in a long lead time and high cost. Gottfried [11] presented a simple metal sealing connector for the connection of water supply and drainage pipelines with diameter less than 168.3 mm under low or zero pressure on land. This paper presents an improved design of subsea pipeline mechanical connector (SPMC) {{that can be used for}} a bigger diameter and a higher pressure in the complicated subsea environment.|$|E
40|$|Double-swivel toggle {{mechanism}} releases large, heavy objects reliably. Double-swiveling {{action of}} mechanism ensures it clears restraining pins upon release. Pins retain toggle and its load. If pin fails to withdraw at designated time for releasing payload, toggle swivels about its upper ball, and <b>ring</b> <b>swivels</b> about lower ball so ring flange clears failed pin. Double-swivel action ensures disengagement even it two pins fail to withdraw...|$|R
50|$|Kubotan (sometimes erroneously spelled as kubaton or kobutan) is a genericized {{trademark}} for a self-defense keychain weapon {{developed by}} Sōke Takayuki Kubota {{in the late}} 1960s. It is typically no more than 5.5 inches (14 centimetres) long and about half an inch (1.25 centimetres) in diameter, slightly thicker or {{the same size as}} a marker pen. The material is usually of a hard high-impact plastic (e.g. Lexan). The body of the Kubotan is lined with six round grooves with a screw eye or <b>swivel</b> and split <b>ring</b> attachment at one end for keys.|$|R
5000|$|It is also {{believed}} that the Ashburnham ring, which is [...] "one {{of the most spectacular}} pieces of Egyptian jewellery {{to be added to the}} Museum's national collection for many years" [...] also originated from General Djehuty's burial. The ring was originally purchased by the Earl of Ashburnham in Cairo in 1825 likely from the proceeds of excavation work carried out by Drovetti in Saqqara and Djehuty's tomb was only discovered in the previous year. This rectangular <b>swivel,</b> bezel <b>ring</b> weighs 35.8 grams and is inscribed on both its sides with the texts: [...] "He of the Two Ladies, Great of terror in all lands" [...] and [...] "Menkheperre, beloved of Ptah, radiant of face." [...] Since Christine Lilyquist's study of Djehuty's gold bowl and other funerary objects showed that Djehuty was likely buried at Saqqara and not Thebes as originally assumed, it would appear that the Ashburnham ring came from Djehuty's tomb treasures.|$|R
