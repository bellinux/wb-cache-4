Often warps are deeply depressed. Pile, warp and weft yarns are excellently balanced. The ratio between horizontal and vertical knots is frequently close to 1:1.

40|$|Seersucker is a {{thin and}} {{puckered}} fabric used to make clothing for spring. Due to its specific structure, this fabric is held away from the skin when worn, facilitating heat dissipation and air circulation. Seersucker is produced by slack tension weaving using two warp beams. Due {{to the use of}} two beams, such fabrics were not possible to weave on conventional (with <b>single</b> <b>warp</b> beam) weaving machines. Additional twin beams arrangement was required for such weaving. The objective of the current study is to produce seersucker fabric on conventional looms using a <b>single</b> <b>warp</b> beam. For achieving this objective, two types of weft yarn: 100 % cotton yarns and blended yarns of cotton and elastane (95. 67 % cotton and 4. 33 % Lycra) are used in groups.

40|$|In this paper, the {{analysis}} of the behavior of thin-wa lled beams, derived from Prokić's work, is carried out by using beam theory with a <b>single</b> <b>warping</b> function valid for arbitrary form of cross sections, without any distinction between open and closed profiles and without using sectorial coordinates. The finite element method is used and numerical examples show the accuracy of the solution by comparison with other numerical or analytical results. For the stability analysis, analytical and numerical calculations of critical loads are given for beams submitted to bending moment and centrally applied forces. Equilibrium equations are established from the principle of virtual work. Critical loads are calculated by considering that a structure already in equilibrium reaches instability if there is one or more than one equilibrium position for the same loading. Results with this formulation are compared to those obtained with classical warping functions. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

Individual threads within a SIMD “warp ” are allowed to slip behind other threads in the same warp, letting the warp continue execution even if a subset of threads are waiting on memory.

All four areas are characterised by distinctly different and well-documented oceanographic conditions, biogeographical affinities and fishing exploitation.

50|$|Bonas Machine Company Ltd. {{launched}} {{the first successful}} electronic Jacquard at ITMA, Milan in 1983. Although the machines were initially small, modern technology has allowed Jacquard machine capacity to increase significantly, and <b>single</b> end <b>warp</b> control can extend to more than 10,000 warp ends. This avoids the need for repeats and symmetrical designs and allows almost infinite versatility. The computer-controlled machines significantly reduce the down time associated with changing punched paper designs, thus allowing smaller batch sizes. However, electronic Jacquards are costly {{and may not be}} required in a factory weaving large batch sizes, and smaller designs. The larger machines allowing <b>single</b> end <b>warp</b> control are very expensive, and can only be justified where great versatility is required, or very specialized design requirements need to be met. For example, they are an ideal tool to increase the ability and stretch the versatility of the niche linen Jacquard weavers who remain active in Europe and the West, while most of the large batch commodity weaving has moved to low cost areas.|$|R

40|$|An {{intrinsically}} conductive knitted fabric-based electrical resistive {{strain gauge}} is developed to measure in-plane or out-of-planar large strain under high temperature. Electro-mechanical properties, which governor {{the sensitivity of}} the gauge, are analyzed theoretically by a model of weft plain fabric. The contacting electrical resistance (R-c), resulted from two overlapped yams, is attributed to be the key factor contributing to the resistance-strain response while the fabric structure determines {{the sensitivity of the}} gauge. Two structures are fabricated making use of the properties of contacting resistance to find the key factors governing the sensitivity, repeatability and accuracy of the sensors. The effects of strain-rate and temperature on the sensitivity of the gauge are analyzed experimentally. From the experimental results, fabric gauges made from carbon fibers display a higher sensitivity, repeatability and accuracy than those made by stainless steel due to its small internal friction and intrinsic physics properties. Meanwhile, tubular structure has high maximum strain level than <b>single</b> <b>warp</b> structure but exhibits lower sensitivity than the latter. Temperature exhibits greater effect on the sensitivity than the strain-rate. (C) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of interlinked, multi-layer fabrics and near net shape preforms for engineering applications, woven on a 48 shaft dobby loom using glass, aramid, and carbon continuous filament yarns is assessed. The interlinking was formed using the warp yarns. Two basic types of structure were used. The first used a <b>single</b> <b>warp</b> beam and hence {{each of the}} warp yarns followed a similar path to form four layer interlinked reinforcements and preforms. In the second two warp beams were used, one for the interlinking yarns which pass from the top to the bottom layer through-the-thickness of the fabric and vice versa, {{and the other to}} provide 'straight' yarns {{in the body of the}} structure to carry the axial loading. Fabrics up to 15 mm in thickness were constructed with varying amounts of through-the-thickness reinforcement. Tapered T and I sections were also woven, with the shaping produced by progressive removal of ends during construction. These fabrics and preforms were impregnated with resin and cured to form composite samples for testing.

40|$|Abstract – Processing marine-mammal signals for passive oceanic {{acoustic}} tomography or species classification and monitoring are {{problems that have}} recently attracted attention in scientific literature. For these purposes, {{it is necessary to}} use a method which could be able to extract the useful information about the processed data, knowing that the underwater environment is highly non-stationary. In this context, time-frequency or time-scale methods constitute a potential approach. Practically, it has been observed that the majority of time-frequency structures of the marine-mammal signals are highly non-linear. This fact affects dramatically the performances achieved by the Cohen's class methods, these methods being efficient in the presence of linear time-frequency structures. Fortunately, thanks to the warping operator principle, it is possible to generate other class of time-frequency representations (TFRs). The new TFRs may analyze non-linear chirp signals better than Cohen's class does. In spite of its mathematical elegance, this principle is limited in real applications by two major elements. First, as we will see, its implementation leads to a considerable growth of the signal length. Consequently, from operational point of view, this principle is limited to short synthetic signals. Secondly, the design of a <b>single</b> <b>warping</b> operator can be inappropriate if the analyzed signal is multi-component. Furthermore, the choice of “adapted ” warping operator becomes a problem when the signal component...|$|R
