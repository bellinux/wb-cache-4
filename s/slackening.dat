5|$|A <b>slackening</b> {{of social}} customs {{occurred}} on all social levels; extramarital relationships and illegitimate children were common. Because poverty {{was on the}} rise—especially in the lower classes—many women were forced to find lodgings quickly, for example in convents, o. This explained the abundance of the clergy in a small city like Quito; often men were ordained not because of a vocation but because it solved their economic problems and improved their community standing.|$|E
5|$|On 11 May, with Chinese forces <b>slackening</b> their offensive, 3rd Ranger Company was {{recalled}} to Kimpo Airfield for parachute proficiency training, {{above the}} objections of the 3rd Infantry Division commanders who considered the company invaluable. The company spent several weeks in division reserve, and undertook various missions such as convoy security and guarding command posts, as well as surveillance and visiting patrols behind the front lines. In one of these rearguard actions, the Rangers evacuated a rundown village only to have {{one member of the}} unit, Corporal Dave Rauls, captured by three Chinese infiltrators.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} {{hour and a half}} the frigates poured shot into one another at close range, until Cooke was struck by grape shot at 01:30 on 1 March, {{replaced}} by his first lieutenant Lucius Hardyman. For another hour the action continued, French fire gradually <b>slackening</b> until it stopped completely at 02:30, by which time only four French guns remained operational. Hardyman hailed to ask whether Forte had surrendered but the French did not reply and he ordered another broadside. A second hail also brought no response but sailors were seen attempting to repair the rigging on Forte. Concerned that the French were attempting to escape, Hardyman concentrated his fire on the masts of Forte, bringing them crashing down one by one until at 03:00 Forte was completely dismasted. With all resistance ended, British merchant prisoners on board Forte emerged from below decks and hailed Sybille, requesting a boat be sent across so that British Lieutenant Nicholas Manger could formally take the surrender of the French ship.|$|E

5|$|Intense Confederate and {{especially}} Union artillery fire continued {{for at least}} an hour, <b>slackening</b> at about 2:30pm. At about 3:30pm, Lewis Armistead noticed Union skirmishers creeping towards his men where the grand battery on the Confederate right flank was, nearly within rifle range of them. Armistead sent three regiments (about half of his brigade) from his command to push back the skirmishers, thus beginning the infantry part of the battle. The skirmishers were repelled quickly, but Armistead's men found themselves {{in the midst of an}} intense Union barrage. The Confederates decided to nestle themselves in a ravine along the hill's slant. This position protected them from the fire, but pinned them down on the slopes of Malvern Hill, unsupported by either infantry or artillery. They did not have enough men to advance any further and retreating would have put them back into the crossfire.|$|E
25|$|The Carstairs to Edinburgh {{line had}} {{difficult}} gradients too. From Carstairs {{there was a}} climb of 1 in 225 stiffening to 1 in 97 as far as Cobbinshaw (eleven miles) then descending at 1 in 100 for five miles, <b>slackening</b> to 1 in 143 almost continuously as far as Edinburgh.|$|E
25|$|After {{several days}} of bombardment, the return fire from the forts {{showed no signs of}} <b>slackening,</b> so Farragut began to execute his own plan. On April 20, he ordered three of his gunboats, Kineo, Itasca, and Pinola to break the chain {{blocking}} the river. Although they did not succeed in removing it altogether, they were able to open a gap large enough for the flag officer's purposes.|$|E

25|$|Most of Gibraltar's Jews {{evacuated}} to the United Kingdom {{during the}} Second World War, when the Allies used Gibraltar {{as a base}} of operations. Some Jews opted {{to stay in the}} United Kingdom, but most returned, although there was a <b>slackening</b> in some of their religious practices. The efforts of the Spanish sephardic Italian born Rabbi Josef Pacifici, who assumed the Gibraltar rabbinate and took control of Jewish education in Gibraltar, helped reverse this tendency. In 1984 Rabbi Ron Hassid became Chief Rabbi.|$|E
25|$|Another {{meeting was}} held on 27 April, {{attended}} by Clemenceau, Foch, Milner, Wilson and Haig. Wilson pressed Foch on whether the priority was {{to hold onto the}} Channel Ports or to keep the British and French armies united. Foch indicated that the latter was the priority. British IX Corps was moved to the French sector. By the end of April Haig claimed to notice a <b>slackening</b> of enemy fighting spirit and on 30 April Ludendorff called a halt to the Flanders offensive, although he hoped to attack the British in Flanders again {{at some point in the}} future.|$|E
25|$|Publicly the Christian Democrats {{had refused}} to {{negotiate}} with terrorists, but privately leading politicians {{and members of the}} secret services visited Cutolo in prison and asked him to negotiate with imprisoned members of the Red Brigades. A large ransom was paid to win Cirillo’s release. In return, Cutolo allegedly asked for a <b>slackening</b> of police operations against the Camorra, for control over the tendering of building contracts in Campania (a lucrative venture since Campania was hit by a devastating earthquake in November 1980) and for a reduction of his own sentence – as well as new psychiatric test to show that he is not responsible for his actions. Both these last concessions were granted.|$|E

25|$|Fergus {{forged a}} marital {{alliance}} with Óláfr Guðrøðarson, King of the Isles through {{the marriage of}} the latter to Fergus' daughter, Affraic. As a consequence of this union, the leading branch of the Crovan dynasty descended from Fergus. When Óláfr was assassinated by a rival branch of the dynasty, Galloway itself was attacked before Fergus' grandson, Guðrøðr Óláfsson, was able to seize control of Isles. Both Fergus and his grandson appear to have overseen military operations in Ireland, before the latter was overthrown by Somairle mac Gilla Brigte, Lord of Argyll. The {{fact that there is}} no record of Fergus lending Guðrøðr support against Somairle could be evidence of a <b>slackening</b> of Fergus' authority. Contemporary sources certainly report that Galloway was wracked by inter-dynastic strife during the decade.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of chemical compounds occurring in biological organisms {{are in fact}} carbon compounds, so the association between organic chemistry and biochemistry is so close that biochemistry might be regarded as in essence a branch of organic chemistry. Although the history of biochemistry might be taken to span some four centuries, fundamental understanding of the field only began to develop in the late 19th century and the actual term biochemistry was coined around the start of 20th century. Research in the field increased throughout the twentieth century, without any indication of <b>slackening</b> {{in the rate of}} increase, as may be verified by inspection of abstraction and indexing services such as BIOSIS Previews and Biological Abstracts, which began in the 1920s as a single annual volume, but has grown so drastically {{that by the end of}} the 20th century it was only available to the everyday user as an online electronic database.|$|E
25|$|The two ironclads {{returned}} to action on March 13, this time assisted by the shore battery and the mortar boat. The Confederate gunners again concentrated their fire on Chillicothe. Although she lost only three wounded among her crew, the pounding she took from the enemy artillery loosened {{many of her}} armor plates and generally revealed the inadequacy of her construction. Baron De Kalb, although not punished so severely, lost three of her officers and men killed and three others wounded. The Rebels lost some of their men also, when a shell entered a magazine. Although it did not explode, its fuze {{set fire to the}} ammunition stored there, and the fire killed one man and burned 15 others. Another shell killed a man and wounded two others. At the end of the day, Fort Pemberton was basically unscathed; the gunboats, however, particularly Chillicothe, had been badly battered. Smith failed to note that the Confederate fire was <b>slackening</b> {{at the end of the}} day, their ammunition supply being depleted.|$|E

25|$|While {{customer}} {{reaction to}} the EV1 was positive, GM believed that electric cars occupied an unprofitable niche of the automobile market, and ended up crushing most of the cars, regardless of protesting customers. Furthermore, an alliance of the major automakers litigated the CARB regulation in court, resulting in a <b>slackening</b> of the ZEV stipulation, permitting the companies to produce super-low-emissions vehicles, natural gas vehicles, and hybrid cars in place of pure electrics. The EV1 program was subsequently discontinued in 2002, and all {{cars on the road}} were repossessed. Lessees were not given the option to purchase their cars from GM, which cited parts, service, and liability regulations. The majority of the repossessed EV1s were crushed, and about 40 were delivered to museums and educational institutes with their electric powertrains deactivated, under the agreement that the cars were not to be reactivated and driven on the road. About 20 units were donated to overseas institutions. In 2016, the TV show Jay Leno's Garage presented an intact EV1 part of the collection of famous filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola. The only intact EV1 was donated to the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
500|$|These {{activities}} affected MIT profoundly. A 1949 report {{noted the}} lack of [...] "any great <b>slackening</b> in the pace of life at the Institute" [...] to match the return to peacetime, remembering the [...] "academic tranquility of the prewar years", though acknowledging the significant contributions of military research to the increased emphasis on graduate education and rapid growth of personnel and facilities. The faculty doubled and the graduate student body quintupled during the terms of Karl Taylor Compton, president of MIT between 1930 and 1948; James Rhyne Killian, president from 1948 to 1957; and Julius Adams Stratton, chancellor from 1952 to 1957, whose institution-building strategies shaped the expanding university. By the 1950s, MIT no longer simply benefited the industries with which it had worked for three decades, and it had developed closer working relationships with new patrons, philanthropic foundations and the federal government.|$|E
500|$|In {{the months}} {{preceding}} the battle, Luftflotte 6 supporting Army Group Center noted a marked {{increase in the}} strength of the opposing VVS formations. The VVS formations encountered displayed better training, and were flying improved equipment with greater aggressiveness and skill than the Luftwaffe had seen earlier. The introduction of the Yakovlev Yak-9 and Lavochkin La-5 fighters gave the Soviet pilots near parity with the Luftwaffe in terms of equipment. Furthermore, large numbers of ground-attack aircraft, such as the Ilyushin Il-2 [...] "Shturmovik" [...] and the Pe-2, had become available as well. The Soviet Air Force also fielded large numbers of aircraft supplied via lend-lease. Huge stockpiles of supplies and ample reserves of replacement aircraft meant the Red Army and VVS formations would be able to conduct an extended campaign without <b>slackening</b> in the intensity of their effort.|$|E

500|$|After the Commando {{headquarters}} {{group had}} landed, Commander Ryder went {{to check for}} himself that Campbeltown was firmly stuck in the dock. Some of her surviving crewmen were being taken on board the MGB. Ryder returned to the boat and ordered the MTB {{to carry out its}} alternative task and torpedo the lock gates at the old entrance to the basin. After a successful torpedo attack, Ryder ordered the MTB to leave. On {{their way out of the}} estuary they stopped to collect survivors from a sinking ML and were hit and set on fire. Back at the docks the MGB had positioned itself in mid-river to engage enemy gun emplacements. The forward 2 pounder was manned by Able Seaman William Alfred Savage. Commander Ryder reported that [...] "The rate of supporting fire had evidently been felt, and the Commandos in the area of the Tirpitz dock had undoubtedly overcome the resistance in that area. There was an appreciable <b>slackening</b> in the enemy's fire." ...|$|E
500|$|Jay Carr of The Boston Globe called Apt Pupil [...] "most {{compelling}} for its moral dimension", enjoying the [...] "duet between Renfro's smooth-cheeked latter-day Faust and McKellen's reawakened Mephistopheles". While Carr found the film's framework to be realistic, {{he noted the}} change of pace, [...] "Perhaps sensing a narrative <b>slackening</b> and a smothering claustrophobia... 'Apt Pupil' veers into melodramatic devices that yank the film out of its disquieting amorality {{and turn it into}} something much more ordinary and mundane." [...] The critic concluded, [...] "It maintains a bleak integrity by not pretending to arrive at remorse. Never is there any discussion." [...] Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune described Apt Pupil as [...] "a good shocker that misses the ultimate horror", finding the film's weakness to be the [...] "contrived" [...] bond between Dussander and Bowden. [...] Wilmington called the plot [...] "overly slick", asking, [...] "How can Todd not only conveniently find a Nazi war criminal in his hometown but also instantly coerce and control him?" ...|$|E
500|$|Air Commodore Alan Charlesworth was {{appointed}} AOC Eastern Area in December 1943. [...] Japanese submarine activity had decreased {{in the months}} prior to Charlesworth taking command, and he was concerned that Allied ships were becoming complacent. He observed [...] "a general <b>slackening</b> off in procedure; ships are seldom where they should be, and a minority of merchant ships identify themselves to aircraft". The RAAF's patrols had also settled into a predictable pattern that an observant submarine captain could easily avoid. Charlesworth relinquished command in September 1944 to take over North-Western Area. In December, aircraft from Eastern Area {{took part in the}} search for the German submarine U-862, but could not prevent it sinking the Liberty ship Robert J. Walker on Christmas; a Beaufort of No.15 Squadron, based at Camden, located the wreck. No.32 Squadron lost a Beaufort with its crew shortly after takeoff from Lowood during the search for U-862, which was called off in January 1945. That month, Air Commodore Leon Lachal became AOC Eastern Area, and held command {{for the duration of the}} Pacific War.|$|E
