5|$|Blacklock was {{retired to}} stud, {{where he became}} a {{successful}} stallion. He first stood at Bishop Burton in Yorkshire, with his fee initially set at 15 guineas and half a guinea for the groom (Thomas Barrow). He was then leased to Thomas Kirkby in York for four seasons where he <b>stood</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> much lower fee. In 1827 he was at Bildeston in Suffolk and was commanding a stud fee of twelve guineas. His fee reached up to 25 guineas.|$|E
5|$|From the {{distance}} of our times, Diefenbaker's role as a prairie populist who tried to revolutionize the Conservative Party begins to loom larger than his personal idiosyncrasies. The difficulties he faced {{in the form of}} significant historical dilemmas seem less easy to resolve than Liberals and hostile journalists opined at the time. If Diefenbaker defies rehabilitation, he can at least be appreciated. He <b>stood</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fascinating and still relevant combination of individual and egalitarian values... But his contemporaries were also right in seeing some kind of disorder near the centre of his personality and his prime-ministership. The problems of leadership, authority, power, ego, and a mad time in history overwhelmed the prairie politician with the odd name.|$|E
5|$|On May 20, 2015, The New York Times {{reported}} that Zayat had sold breeding {{rights to the}} colt to the Ashford Stud, a division of Ireland's Coolmore Stud, but retained control over the colt and his racing career. Before the announcement, offers for American Pharoah's breeding rights reportedly exceeded $20 million. After the Belmont, Forbes magazine {{reported that}} Zayat had actually sold the breeding rights to Ashford in late 2014, long before he began his Triple Crown run, and that Zayat retained 100% of the racing rights. Forbes went on to estimate that if American Pharoah <b>stood</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> $100,000 stud fee, he could be worth $50 million. More conservative estimates placed his potential stud fee at $75,000 and his potential value at about $25 to $36 million. The New York Times said that breeding rights had been sold for $13.8 million: $9.8 million with an additional $4 million incentive if American Pharoah won the Belmont Stakes. Zayat retained an undisclosed percentage in the colt's breeding career, and explained that American Pharoah would retire from racing {{at the end of}} 2015.|$|E

5|$|The {{first record}} of Auriga's stars was in Mesopotamia as a {{constellation}} called GAM, representing a scimitar or crook. However, {{this may have}} represented just Capella (Alpha Aurigae) or the modern constellation as a whole; this figure was alternatively called Gamlum or MUL.GAM in the MUL.APIN. The crook of Auriga <b>stood</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> goat-herd or shepherd. It was formed {{from most of the}} stars of the modern constellation; all of the bright stars were included except for Elnath, traditionally assigned to both Taurus and Auriga. Later, Bedouin astronomers created constellations that were groups of animals, where each star represented one animal. The stars of Auriga comprised a herd of goats, an association also present in Greek mythology. The association with goats carried into the Greek astronomical tradition, though it later became associated with a charioteer along with the shepherd.|$|E

25|$|Dalziel won the {{election}} with nearly a 50,000 votes margin {{and a majority of}} 48%, with Lonsdale receiving nearly 23,000 votes.

25|$|Unlike Dalziel, who contested the mayoralty only, Lonsdale also <b>stood</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{position}} as a city councillor and came second in the two-member Hagley-Ferrymead ward, and was thus confirmed elected. As The Press had predicted, the remaining mayoral candidates received a low number of votes, with only Cattermole gaining just over 1,000 votes. The mayor and councillors were sworn in on 24 October.|$|E
25|$|One {{abbreviation}} for shilling is s (for solidus, see £sd). Often it {{was represented by}} a solidus symbol ("/"), which may have originally <b>stood</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long s or ſ, thus 1/9 would be one shilling and ninepence (and equivalent to 21d; the shilling itself was equal to 12d).

25|$|In the 15th and 16th century, despite {{considerations}} and systematization {{of the laws}} of war, women remained objects available to the conquering male in any way whatsoever. The influential writer Francisco de Vitoria <b>stood</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> gradual emergence of the notion that glory or conquest were not necessarily acceptable reasons to start a war. The jurist Alberico Gentili insisted that all women, including female combatants, should be spared from sexual assault in wartime. However, in practice war rape was common.|$|E
25|$|Greek is in {{turn the}} source of all the modern scripts of Europe.

She instead <b>stood</b> <b>for</b> , <b>a</b> National safe seat. Clark studied abroad on a University Grants Committee post-graduate scholarship in 1976, and then lectured in political studies at Auckland again while undertaking her PhD (which she never completed) from 1977 until her election to Parliament in 1981 (her father supported National that election).|$|E
25|$|Sămănătorul and Viața Românească, having {{comparable}} {{influence over}} the literature of Romania, <b>stood</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> traditionalist and ruralist approach to art, even though the latter adopted a more left-wing perspective, known as Poporanism. The leading Poporanist ideologue, Garabet Ibrăileanu, became a personal friend of the young writer after inviting him on an excursion down the Râșca River. With his subsequent pieces for Viața Românească, Sadoveanu became especially known as the raconteur of hunting trips, but also sparked controversy when a young woman writer, Constanța Marino-Moscu, accused him of having plagiarized her works in his Mariana Vidrașcu, a serialized novel which was discontinued and later largely forgotten.|$|E
25|$|Ahead of the 2010 election, the Togolese {{government}} {{took steps to}} increase {{the credibility of the}} electoral process and reassure the international community that the election would be free and fair.

Gnassingbé <b>stood</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> second term as the candidate of the RPT, while the UFC designated Fabre as its candidate due to health problems suffered by its President, Gilchrist Olympio. Although the UFC was the largest opposition party by a large measure, and although the election was to be decided in a single round on a first past the post basis, the other opposition parties largely refused to rally behind Fabre and chose to nominate their own candidates.|$|E

25|$|In 1909, in Qajari ruled Persia (today Iran) the Democrat Party (also {{translated}} as Democratic Party) during the constitutional period, {{was one of}} two major parliamentary parties at the time, alongside its rival the Moderate Socialists Party. Initially an offshoot of the Transcaucasia-based Social Democratic Party, it was largely composed of liberal middle-class intellectuals and <b>stood</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> representative political system and {{the separation of church and}} state, to limit the authority of the monarchy and the clergy. It influenced the Constitution of 1906 which created the Majlis (parliament) and the senate. However, due internal and external factors, the party couldn't grow significantly and was suppressed and when the Pahlavi Dynasty was established in 1925, fragmenting itself into different smaller associations.|$|E
25|$|Nor may the Essenes be classed {{among the}} order of ascetics. While some of their institutions, notably celibacy, appear to {{lend support to the}} theory that would class them as such, their {{fundamental}} doctrines show no connection with the pessimism that is the essential factor in Asceticism. They were political indifferentists; they were but little, if at all, under the sway of national aspirations. They <b>stood</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> universal fellowship of the pure and just. They set but little store by the goods of this earth, and were members of a communistic fraternity. But it is inadmissible to construe from these elements of their hopes and habits the inference that in them is to be found a genuine Jewish order of monks and ascetics.|$|E
25|$|On 5 December 2008, George {{was convicted}} in Snaresbrook Crown Court, London, of the assault and false {{imprisonment}} of Audun Carlsen—a Norwegian who initially <b>stood</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> photography session with George, but on their next meeting George handcuffed him to a wall fixture, traumatising him, and subjected him to violence. George's defence gave the effects of his long-term drug use as a mitigating factor. On 16 January 2009, George was sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment for these offences. George was initially incarcerated at HM Prison Pentonville, but was then transferred to HM Prison Highpoint North. He was given early release after four months for good behaviour on 11 May 2009. George was required to wear an ankle monitor and submit to a curfew {{for the remainder of}} his sentence.|$|E
