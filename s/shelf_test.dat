Optical modeling shows that this class of thermal resists is wavelength invariant, and Bi/In can perform even better at 13. 4 nm than at 248 nm due to the increase of absorption and the reduction of reflection. Images were successfully made on Bi/In films with both proximity (0. 5 mm) and projection exposures with Nd-YAG laser running at 2 nd harmonic wavelength. A new kind of developing solution (HCl:H 2 O 2 :H 2 O= 1 : 1 : 48) used at room temperature was found to be more effective in descumming than nitric acetic acid solution. Both have the etching selectivity of unexposed area to exposed area> 60 : 1.

The test concept consists of four process models, one for each test phase and several so called software engineering modules. They describe in datail the test activity to be used, and offer templates in which all test relevant information will be gathered. Seven real world projects from aerospace and other technical areas applied this test concept. This paper presents an outline of the concept developed in ATECON and reports about experiences gained during its application.

40|$|The {{governing}} {{processes in}} the transition zone between an ice sheet and an ice shelf {{remains one of the}} least understood problems in ice dynamics. The complex relationship between the simplified Navier Stokes equations and a nonlinear flow law prevents extensive analytical investigation of the ice flow, however the increasingly rapid evolution in computer technology enables an intensified numerical analysis of the connection between the different glacial features of an ice sheet and an ice shelf. For many years, discussions about the stability of marine ice sheets have concentrated on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, large parts of which go to ground well below sea level. Such ice masses are very sensitive to the dynamic processes governing the transition from the grounded ice to the floating ice shelves. The first theories postulating an inherent instability have proved to be unrealistic. The real behaviour of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet has yet to be understood. Still, there remains the idea of a dramatic retreat, triggered by a climatic change. The dynamical consequences of the change in basal boundary conditions in the transition zone appear to be the basic problem in stability discussions. Three briefly reviews the theories and past numerical models. Introduces a new three dimensional numerical model of ice flow derived from the physical principles of viscoplastic deformation. Using the formulation of Van der Veen and Whillans (1989) for separating full stresses into lithostatic and resistive components, it develops a set of equations that can be solved numerically. The model was compared with other numerical models and analytical theory using the EISMINT (European Ice Sheet Modelling Initiative) ice <b>shelf</b> <b>test.</b> The results show that an ice shelf effectively decouples from an ice sheet if it has free slip conditions at its sides. The ice sheet and ice shelf will strongly interact if there is lateral shearing. In the simple model configurations, the transition zone formed within a horizontal distance of a few ice thicknesses. The more complex models including lateral shearing have not yet reached steady state. No final quantitative results have been obtained, although the models evolve through stable, realistic configurations.

40|$|The {{advantage}} of being “First to Market” is tremendous, but keeping a high and consistent level of quality is determinant as well {{for the success of}} a food company. Low quality products cause damage to the brand and monetary loses in the long run. Quality is strongly influenced by a correct estimation of shelf life, but full length <b>shelf</b> life <b>tests</b> demands large inputs of time and money. The need for a more efficient method of estimating shelf life is therefore required, and the use of accelerated storage tests has gained in popularity in recent years. “Accelerated Shelf Life Tests” is by definition a method that allows the estimation of shelf life through short term storage tests. This is done by converting the accelerated storage results mathematically to represent normal storage conditions, often using different kinetic models. This project intends to evaluate the potential of using accelerated shelf life as a method for shelf life estimation for wet sauces. Two sauces was evaluated in this study; Pizza topping and Taco sauce with previously known shelf life of nine months and 18 months respectively. The shelf life was estimated by exposing the samples to high temperatures and light during a time period of eight weeks in Climate Chambers (Sanyo Gallenkamp Prime Incubator, INC- 000 - MA 1. 9). The light source was a LED lamp that emitted light around 680 to 770 lux and the samples was stored at 22 ° C, 30 ° C and 40 ° C. The samples were then evaluated by sensory analysis and by measuring pigment degradation. The result showed some inconsistencies with the theoretical aspects of the study. The Pizza topping was estimated to have a shelf life of eight months, and the Taco sauce was predicted to maintain quality for about 17 months. These values correspond well to the current estimated shelf life used. However, the results yielded different estimations depending on how the results were calculated. Q 10 – modelling, a method that deduces a conversion factor that allows for direct translation of accelerated storage test results into normal storage condition yielded considerably shorter estimated shelf life values while the use of the Arrhenius equation seemed to results in more realistic values. In addition, the colour analysis resulted in different results when compared to the sensory analysis. The recommendation is that accelerated <b>shelf</b> life <b>tests</b> have {{the potential to be a}} valuable tool when predicting product shelf life in a fast-paced innovation environment. However, due to the inconsistencies of the results it is recommended to perform further investigations before adopting accelerated <b>shelf</b> life <b>tests</b> as a standard method for shelf life estimation...|$|R
40|$|Eye-tracking {{has been}} {{extensively}} used to quantify audience preferences {{in the context of}} marketing and advertising research, primarily in methodologies involving static images or stimuli (i. e. advertising, <b>shelf</b> <b>testing,</b> and website usability). However, these methodologies do not generalize to narrative-based video stimuli where a specific storyline is meant to be communicated to the audience. In this paper, a novel metric based on eye-gaze dispersion (both within and across viewings) that quantifies the impact of narrative-based video stimuli to the preferences of large audiences is presented. The metric is validated in predicting the performance of video advertisements aired during the 2014 Super Bowl final. In particular, the metric is shown to explain 70 % of the variance in likeability scores of the 2014 Super Bowl ads as measured by the USA TODAY Ad Meter. In addition, by comparing the proposed metric with Heart Rate Variability (HRV) indices, we have associated the metric with biological processes relating to attention allocation. The underlying idea behind the proposed metric suggests a shift in perspective when it comes to evaluating narrative-based video stimuli. In particular, it suggests that audience preferences on video are modulated by the level of viewer’s lack of attention allocation. The proposed metric can be calculated on any narrative-based video stimuli (i. e. movie, narrative content, emotional content, etc.), and thus has the potential to facilitate the use of such stimuli in several contexts: prediction of audience preferences of movies, quantitative assessment of entertainment pieces, prediction of the impact of movie trailers, identification of group and individual differences in the study of attention-deficit disorders and, the study of desensitization to media violence...|$|R
40|$|Language Proficiency Assessments – Issues {{with many}} of the {{language}} proficiency tests currently available include: � How we conceptualize language arts and language proficiency, especially in the areas of reading and writing. � The degree to which off the <b>shelf</b> <b>tests</b> are aligned with state English language proficiency standards � How well the English proficiency standards define proficiency levels that will help English-language learners acquire the language skills necessary to meet academic content and achievement standards � The feasibility and practicality of giving an assessment that requires a substantial amount of time to administer � How well any one assessment can meet the needs of students from diverse language backgrounds � The level of resources (both financial and technical) available to states for the development and validation of assessments, and for technical assistance {{in the use of the}} assessments. Accommodations for Language Arts and Math Assessments during the 3 - 5 Year Window � There are two broad categories of accommodations [...] changes in the assessment itself and changes in the standard testing conditions. � Many of the accommodations in use are questionable because they are not theoretically defensible, do not treat the language difficulties of English-language learners, or lack research evidence. � Three important factors in considering the merits of accommodations are effectiveness, validity, and feasibility and cost of implementation. � The only effective and valid accommodation found for English language learners is the use of English glossaries and dictionaries; native-language assessments are only useful for students who received content-area instruction in the native language � Additional research is needed to fully examine the efficacy of any particula...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} lyoprotectants (sucrose, dimethyl-succinate buffer (DMS), bovine serum albumin (BSA), mannitol and dextran, mw 60 kDa) on {{the stability of}} the enzyme lignin peroxidase (LiP, EC number: 1. 11. 1. -), both during the freeze-drying process and storage were investigated. The <b>shelf</b> stability <b>tests</b> were performed at 4 °C and 27 °C. Both DMS buffer and sucrose showed a good protective action: the former was particularly effective during the process, while the latter improved the stability during storage. In contrast, mannitol and dextran had negative effects, reducing the activity also in the lignin peroxidase solution. BSA was discarded because, in the range of compatible concentrations with LiP, it does not confer a consistent structure to the freeze-dried product...|$|R
