5|$|With {{the opening}} of the New York – Pennsylvania Joint Bridge Commission, a {{predecessor}} of the current Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission, in the 1920s to buy out these bridges from private ownership, the tolls along the bridges of the Delaware were beginning to come to an end. The Commission offered the Bridge Company an offer of $19,542.22 (1920s USD). The company took the offer and under new ownership, the tolls were eliminated. The bridge had more activity after the elimination of tolls and business continued to prosper. With the new owners, the bridge was kept under routine maintenance, and the bridge has continued to maintain a <b>strong</b> <b>structure.</b> Even with the floods from Hurricanes Connie and Diane of 1955 and the 1960s, the bridge survived with little to no structural damage. From May to October 1986, the commission closed the bridge to do some renovations. The wooden deck was replaced, the entire bridge was painted, and new guide rails were constructed. The only thing is that the 3 ton (6000lb) weight limit remained after the revamping. On November 14, 1988, the bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
25|$|Bars are the inward {{folds of}} the wall, {{originating}} from the heels at an abrupt angle. The <b>strong</b> <b>structure</b> built up by the extremity of the heel and of the bar is named the 'heel buttress'. The sole between the heel walls and the bars is named the 'seat of corn', {{and it is a}} very important landmark used by natural hoof trimmers to evaluate the correct heel height. The bars have a three-layer structure, just like the walls (see above). When overgrown, they bend outwards and cover the lower surface of the sole.|$|E

2500|$|The Nasta'liq {{style is}} the most popular {{contemporary}} style among classical Persian calligraphy scripts; Persian calligraphers call it the [...] "bride of calligraphy scripts". This calligraphy style has been based on such a <b>strong</b> <b>structure</b> that it has changed very little since.

It has very strict rules for graphical shape of the letters and for combination of the letters, words, and composition of the whole calligraphy piece.|$|E
2500|$|The unique {{structure}} of quadruplex regions in RNA may serve different functions in a biological system. [...] Two important functions [...] are the binding potential with ligands or proteins, {{and its ability}} to stabilize the whole tertiary {{structure of}} DNA or RNA. [...] The <b>strong</b> <b>structure</b> can inhibit or modulate transcription and replication, such as in the telomeres of chromosomes and the UTR of mRNA. [...] The base identity is important towards ligand binding. [...] The G-quartet typically binds monovalent cations such as potassium, while other bases can bind numerous other ligands such as hypoxanthine in a U-U-C-U quadruplex.|$|E

2500|$|Aerogel {{structure}} {{results from}} a sol-gel polymerization, which is when monomers (simple molecules) react with other monomers to form a sol or a substance that consists of bonded, cross-linked macromolecules with deposits of liquid solution between them. [...] When the material is critically heated the liquid is evaporated out and the bonded, cross-linked macromolecule frame is left behind. [...] The result of the polymerization and critical heating {{is the creation of}} a material that has a porous <b>strong</b> <b>structure</b> classified as aerogel. Variations in synthesis can alter the surface area and pore size of the aerogel. The smaller the pore size the more suceptible the aerogel is to fracture.|$|E
2500|$|The {{experts who}} {{evaluated}} the captured Zero {{found that the}} plane weighed about [...] fully loaded, some [...] lighter than the Grumman F4F Wildcat, the standard United States Navy fighter of the time. The A6M's airframe was [...] "built like a fine watch"; the Zero was constructed with flush rivets, and even the guns were flush with the wings. The instrument panel was a [...] "marvel of simplicity... with no superfluities to distract [...]" [...] What most impressed the experts was that the Zero's fuselage and wings were constructed in one piece, unlike the American method that built them separately and joined the two parts together. The Japanese method was much slower, but resulted in a very <b>strong</b> <b>structure</b> and improved close maneuverability.|$|E
2500|$|The P-40 tolerated harsh {{conditions}} {{and a variety}} of climates. Its semi-modular design was easy to maintain in the field. It lacked innovations such as boosted ailerons or automatic leading edge slats, but its <b>strong</b> <b>structure</b> included a five-spar wing, which enabled P-40s to pull high-G turns and survive some midair collisions. Intentional ramming attacks against enemy aircraft were occasionally recorded as victories by the Desert Air Force and Soviet Air Forces. Caldwell said P-40s [...] "would take a tremendous amount of punishment, violent aerobatics as well as enemy action." [...] Operational range was good by early war standards and was almost double that of the Supermarine Spitfire or Messerschmitt Bf 109, although inferior to the Mitsubishi A6M Zero, Nakajima Ki-43 and Lockheed P-38 Lightning.|$|E

2500|$|It was in {{the years}} 1913–15 that he {{developed}} the style of geometric abstraction {{for which he is}} best known today, a style which his friend Ezra Pound dubbed [...] "Vorticism." [...] Lewis found the <b>strong</b> <b>structure</b> of Cubist painting appealing, but said it did not seem [...] "alive" [...] compared to Futurist art, which, conversely, lacked structure. Vorticism combined the two movements in a strikingly dramatic critique of modernity. In his early visual works, particularly versions of village life in Brittany showing dancers (ca. 1910–12), Lewis may have been influenced by the process philosophy of Henri Bergson, whose lectures he attended in Paris. Though he was later savagely critical of Bergson, he admitted in a letter to Theodore Weiss (19 April 1949) that he [...] "began by embracing his evolutionary system." [...] Nietzsche was an equally important influence.|$|E
60|$|Lakamba's {{own house}} was a <b>strong</b> <b>structure</b> of solid planks, raised on high piles, with a {{verandah}} of split bamboos surrounding it on all sides; the whole was covered in by an immensely high-pitched roof of palm-leaves, resting on beams blackened by the smoke of many torches.|$|E
60|$|Three of {{the white}} men lay {{sleeping}} or smoking in the little cabin, which was partly raised above and partly sunk beneath the after-deck. It was a reasonably <b>strong</b> <b>structure,</b> but it worked, and sweated, as they sat at sea, and {{the heat of the}} stove had further opened up the seams in it. Moisture dripped from the beams overhead, moisture trickled up and down the slanting deck, there were great globules of water on the bulk-heading, and everything, including the men's clothes and blankets, was wet. The men lay in their bunks from necessity, because it was a laborious matter to sit. They said very little since it was difficult to hear anything amid the cataclysm of elemental sound. It became at length almost a relief to turn out into inky darkness or misty daylight, dimmed by flying spray, to take a turn at the jarring wheel.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} query {{structures}} and query expansion (QE) on retrieval performance were tested with a best match retrieval system (INQUERY). Query structure means {{the use of}} operators to express the relations between search keys. Eight different structures were tested, representing weak structures (averages and weighted averages of the weights of the keys) and <b>strong</b> <b>structures</b> (e. g., queries with more elaborated search key relations). QE was based on concepts, which were first selected from a conceptual model, and then expanded by semantic relationships given in the model. The expansion levels were (a) no expansion, (b) a synonym expansion, (c) a narrower concept expansion, (d) an associative concept expansion, and (e) a cumulative expansion of all other expansions. With weak structures and Boolean structured queries, QE was not very effective. The best performance was achieved {{with one of the}} <b>strong</b> <b>structures</b> at the largest expansion level...|$|R
