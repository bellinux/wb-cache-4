We investigate linearized perturbations of the horizon branch and the extremal solution numerically, completing an investigation initiated in a previous paper.

We study small perturbations of these solutions, constructing a sufficiently general ansatz for linearised perturbations of the non-extremal solutions, and show that the linearised equations are consistent. We investigate linearised perturbations of the horizon branch and the extremal solution numerically. We show that these solutions are stable against the perturbations we consider. This provides further evidence that these latter supergravity solutions are capturing some of the true physics of the enhançon. We show that the <b>shell</b> <b>branch</b> solutions violate the weak energy condition, and are hence unphysical. We extend the investigation of nonextremal enhançons, finding the most general solutions with the correct symmetry and charges. There are two families of solutions. One of these contains a solution with a regular horizon found previously; this previous example is shown to be the unique solution with a regular horizon. The other family generalises a previous nonextreme extension of the enhançon, producing solutions with shells which satisfy the Weak Energy Condition.

Complex, highly optimized structural prototype and flight designs were evolved through the application of relatively advanced buckling analysis methodology. Both designs were evaluated through tests and analysis with improved shell-of-revolution computer programs. Deviations between the analyses and experiments were resolved only by modeling the thin-walled rings as <b>shell</b> <b>branches.</b> The results illustrate the great complexity of shell behavior and the designer's need for reliable analysis tools capable of representing detailed structural behavior with greater accuracy than is current practice...|$|R
40|$|A {{rigorous}} analytical {{study of}} cones stiffened by many thin-gage, open-section rings is presented. The results are compared with data previously obtained from uniform pressure {{tests of the}} Viking mission flight aeroshell and of the Viking structural prototype aeroshells. A conventional analysis, in which the rings are modeled as discrete rigid cross sections, is shown to lead to large, unconservative strength predictions. A more sophisticated technique of modeling the rings as <b>shell</b> <b>branches</b> leads to much more realistic strength predictions and more accurately predicts the failure modes. It is also shown that if a small initial imperfection proportional {{to the shape of}} the buckling mode is assumed, the critical buckling modes from analysis and test are in agreement. However, the reduction in buckling strength from the perfect-shell predictions is small...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{constitutive}} model for describing the creep and creep damage in initially isotropic materials with different properties in tension and compression {{has been applied}} to the modeling of creep deformation and creep damage growth in thin-walled shells of revolution with the branched meridian. The approach of establishing the basic equations for axisymmetrically loaded <b>branched</b> <b>shells</b> under creep deformation and creep damage conditions has been introduced. To solve the initial/boundary-value problem, the fourth-order Runge–Kutta–Merson’s method of time integration with the combination of the numerically stable Godunov’s method of discrete orthogonalization is used. The solution of the boundary value problem for the <b>branched</b> <b>shell</b> at each time instant is reduced to integration of the series of systems of ordinary differential equations describing the deformation of each <b>branch</b> and the <b>shell</b> with basic meridian. Some numerical examples are considered, and the processes of creep deformation and creep damage growth in a shell with non-branched meridian as well as in a <b>branched</b> <b>shell</b> are analyzed. The influence of the tension–compression asymmetry on the stress–strain state and damage evolution in a shell with non-branched meridian as well as in a <b>branched</b> <b>shell</b> with time are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Ferrocene {{has been}} {{encapsulated}} within a symmetric ether-amide dendritic shell and its redox potential monitored {{in a variety}} of solvents. The dendritic effect generated by the <b>branched</b> <b>shell</b> is different in different solvents. In less polar, non hydrogen bond donor solvents, attachment of the <b>branched</b> <b>shell</b> to ferrocene increases its E 1 / 2, indicating that oxidation to ferrocenium (charge buildup) becomes thermodynamically hindered by the dendrimer, a result explained by the dendrimer providing a less polar medium than that of the surrounding electrolyte solution. The effect of electrolyte concentration on redox potential was also investigated, and it was shown that the concentration of “innocent” electrolyte has a significant effect on the redox potential by increasing the overall polarity of the surrounding medium. Dendritic destabilization of charge buildup is in agreement with the majority of reported dendritic effects. A notable exception to this is provided by the asymmetric ferrocene dendrimers previously reported by Kaifer and co-workers, in which the branching facilitated oxidation, and it is proposed that in this case the dendritic effect is generated by a different mechanism. Interestingly, in methanol, the new symmetric ferrocene dendrimer exhibited almost no dendritic effect, a result explained by the ability of methanol to interact extensively with the <b>branched</b> <b>shell,</b> generating a more open superstructure. By comparison of all the new data with other reports, this study provides a key insight into the structure−activity relationships which control redox processes in dendrimers and also an insight into the electrochemical process itself. ...|$|R
