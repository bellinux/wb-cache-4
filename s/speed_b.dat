To optimize the optimum printing process for aluminum paste printing ink，the L 9 (3 4) orthogonal design {{is used to}} observe influential {{factors such as the}} modified ratio of aluminum paste printing ink (A), printing <b>speed</b> (<b>B),</b> drying power (C). Print gloss, masking effects and scratch results are determined to evaluate the effects of different processes, and the results are analyzed by grading methods including direct method and variance method. The results showed that the main factor was printing <b>speed</b> (<b>B),</b> and the optimum extraction process was that print speed was 70 m/min, the first printing UV drying power was 12 kw and the second printing UV drying power was 12 kw with the second modified aluminum paste printing ink. The optimal extraction process is simple, repeatable and adapt to industrial production...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine {{relationships}} between weather and outdoor physical activity (PA). An online weather source was used to obtain daily max temperature [DMT], precipitation, and wind speed. An infra-red trail counter provided data on daily trail use along a greenway, over a 2 -year period. Multiple regression analysis was used to examine associations between PA and weather, while controlling for day of the week and month of the year. The overall regression model explained 77. 0 % of the variance in daily PA (p < 0. 001). DMT (b = 10. 5), max temp-squared (b = − 4. 0), precipitation (b = − 70. 0), and max wind <b>speed</b> (<b>b</b> = 1. 9) contributed significantly.

40|$|Most human gait forms assume symmetrical, {{alternating}} {{patterns of}} interlimb coordination (e. g., crawling, walking, running). Human galloping is a notable exception. In contrast to extensive information on galloping in animals, {{little is known}} about this gait in humans. Therefore, kinematic and topographical analyses of running and galloping were undertaken to investigate {{the manner in which the}} lower limbs are uncoupled to produce this asymmetrical gait. Seven adult females were filmed while running and galloping at their preferred speed. Analysis of the gaits revealed differences in the following: (a) preferred <b>speed,</b> (<b>b)</b> coupling between upper- and lower-limb girdles, and (c) point of foot fall (end-point trajectories).

40|$|In {{many areas}} of {{economic}} analysis, economic theory restricts the shape of functions. Examples are the monotonicity and curvature conditions that apply to utility, profit, and cost functions. Here we extend upon a currently available estimation method (Terrell, 1996) for imposing regularity regionally on a connected subset of the regressor space. This method offers important advantages by imposing theoretical consistency not only locally, at a given evaluation point but also within the whole empirically relevant region of the domain associated with the function being estimated. The method also provides benefits through higher flexibility, which generally leads to {{a better model fit}} to the sample data. Specific contributions of this paper are (a) to increase the computational <b>speed,</b> (<b>b)</b> to provide regularity preserving point estimates, and (c) to illustrate the benefits of this revised regional approach via numerical simulation results...|$|E
40|$|T a m a o MATSUI The phenomenal {{growth of}} the Japanese economy has {{generated}} {{a lot of interest}} on Japanese management.

Despite the popularity of Japanese management, however, only Quality Control (Q. C.) circles as a management technique, has been diffused worldwide. Q. C. circles are seen to be a key element that led to the dramatic improvement of the quality of Japanese products.

40|$|Quality {{improvement}} {{is crucial for}} manufacturing companies to survive in today’s marketplace. The main {{purpose of this study}} was to improve the quality of one selected product produced by a manufacturing company using the Taguchi Method. The product, a plastic injection moulding is studied as it showed the highest reject quantity. The type of defects found in the product includes bubble, short mould, scratches and over pack. However due to company’s request and limitations, only two defects, short mould and over pack, were further investigated. Experimentation using Taguchi method was decided as the approach to reduce the occurrence of the defects. To that end, four main factors affecting the surface defects were identified. They are injection pressure (A), injection <b>speed</b> (<b>B),</b> melting temperature (C) and holding pressure (D). Taguchi method was chosen since it provides fast and lower costs for conducting the experiments as well as in determining optimum parameter. Qualitek- 4 software was used to facilitate the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio analysis in the Taguchi Method and to predict the results at optimal parameters setting. The results from the two levels of experiments (L 8) suggest that all parameters and 2 -factor interactions investigated were significant for short mould and all the factors should be set at high level to achieve optimum condition. In the case of the over pack problem, two significant factors and one significant interaction factor which are injection <b>speed</b> (<b>B),</b> melting temperature (C) and interaction AB (injection pressure and melting temperature) were found to be significant and should be set at low level. Confirmation run was conducted for over pack problem and the recommended optimal settings are injection pressure at high level, injection speed at low level, melting temperature at low level and holding pressure at high level (A 2 B 1 C 1 D 2). Future studies could look at introducing others factors that may be involved in the process and to possibly use conventional design of experiment metho...|$|E
