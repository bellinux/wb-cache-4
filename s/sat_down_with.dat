25|$|Rotation at La Vielle {{always took}} place the same way: The vedette {{approaches}} {{as close to}} the rocks as possible, amid the roar and swell of the waves. Once close, the crew secured the rope launched by the keepers. The rope was used to ferry a passenger back and forth. Once the passenger had secured his safety belt, he <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> his luggage astride a kind of large ball that slid up or down the rope. In stormy weather the manoeuvre was particularly delicate and difficult; in fierce gales it was often impossible.|$|E

In the following weeks, Mike and Maria would be unintentionally interrupted by Sami Zayn, leading to the Kanellises to demand an apology on the July 11 episode, but Zayn refused.

On the July 18 episode of SmackDown, Kanellis faced Zayn in his WWE debut match in a winning effort, after interference by Maria. A rematch was subsequently scheduled for Battleground with Zayn winning. The following episode of SmackDown Mike along side Aiden English would lose a tag team match against Zayn and Tye Dillinger.

500|$|During recording, Timberlake <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> Madonna {{and played}} a guitar riff {{composed}} by him, asking her how she wanted the song to sound. Madonna had [...] "all these thoughts, riddles, poems, feelings, all written in huge notebooks," [...] Timberlake said, [...] "and she kept handing them over. It was amazing, taking these little bits {{here and there and}} putting them together like a puzzle." [...] In this way, one of the ideas they connected was the universality of long-distance relationships, the pain and heartache of which they were able to incorporate in [...] "Miles Away". After recording it, Timberlake commented that he had helped in creating a classic Madonna song, saying [...] "I couldn't do a song like that, [...] I thought it was completely her. That was the trick." ...|$|E

Henson approached Terry Jones to write the film's script as [...] "his daughter Lisa had just read Erik the Viking and suggested that he try me as screen-writer."

[...] He concluded, [...] " [...] 'Tumbling Dice' [...] " [...] was written to fit Keith's riff. It's about gambling and love, an old blues track." ...|$|E

Several days after the concert, Carey <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> Melinda Newman from Billboard, telling her of the experience recording the show, as well as her view on it from a creative perspective. She said [...] "Unplugged taught me a lot about myself because I tend to nitpick everything I do and make it a bit too perfect because I'm a perfectionist.

I always want to redo it five minutes after I'm done with it. That goes down to songwriting too - it's never going to be perfect. Nothing's perfect. So yeah, I went in and did all the solos for that album in a day. I just <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> a six pack of beer with Kerry and Terry Date. They just let me do my own thing. Tom came in after I had been messing around with a solo for a half an hour and he told me the first take was perfect.

You've got to know when to just let it go and keep it whether it's raw or rough or perfect or maybe there a little bit of magic in there." ...|$|E
