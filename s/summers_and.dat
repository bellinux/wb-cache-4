5|$|Many regions have different, often contrasting, microclimates. In general, {{northern}} {{parts of}} the country are characterized by hot, humid, rainy <b>summers</b> <b>and</b> mild winters with periodic droughts. Mesopotamia, in the northeast is characterized by high temperatures and abundant precipitation throughout the year with droughts being uncommon. West of this lies the Chaco region, which is the warmest region in Argentina. Precipitation in the Chaco region decreases westwards, resulting in the vegetation changing from forests in the east to shrubs in the west. Northwest Argentina is predominantly dry and hot although the rugged topography makes it climatically diverse, ranging from the cold, dry Puna to thick jungles. The center of the country, which includes the Pampas to the east and the drier Cuyo region to the west has hot summers with occasional tornadoes and thunderstorms, and cool, dry winters. Patagonia, in the southern {{parts of the}} country has a dry climate with warm <b>summers</b> <b>and</b> cold winters characterized by strong winds throughout the year and one of the strongest precipitation gradients in the world. High elevations at all latitudes experience cooler conditions, and the mountainous zones can see heavy snowfall.|$|E
5|$|Salta, {{like the}} rest of the Solway plain, has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate {{classification}} Cfb), with warm <b>summers</b> <b>and</b> cool winters which generally avoid extremes of temperature. Salta has a cool climate, with average daytime highs of around 19°C during July and 7°C during December, although lows of −12°C have been recorded. It is wet all year round, with rain or drizzle expected on 16 to 19 days of most months. Snowfall is relatively uncommon.|$|E
5|$|The Ampezzano is {{typically}} Alpine climate, with short <b>summers</b> <b>and</b> long winters that vacillate between frigid, snowy, unsettled, and temperate. In late December and early January, some of Italy's lowest recorded temperatures {{are to be}} found in the region, especially at the top of the Cimabanche Pass on the border between the provinces of Belluno and Bolzano. The other seasons are generally rainy, cold, and very windy.|$|E
50|$|Typically the {{hypolimnion}} is {{the coldest}} layer {{of a lake}} in <b>summer,</b> <b>and</b> the warmest layer during winter.

25|$|Tacitus relates {{that the}} early Germans celebrated only three seasons, the {{equivalents}} to spring, <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> winter, while the Law Book of Iceland, from a thousand years later, indicates that the Germanic Icelanders divided the year only into <b>summer</b> <b>and</b> winter.|$|R
50|$|<b>Summer</b> <b>and</b> winter hours vary.|$|R
5|$|The Chaco {{region in}} the center-north has a {{subtropical}} climate with hot, humid <b>summers</b> <b>and</b> mild, dry winters. Under the Köppen climate classification, the west has a semi-arid climate (Bs) while the east has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa). Chaco {{is one of the}} few natural regions in the world located between tropical and temperate latitudes that is not a desert. Precipitation and temperature are relatively homogeneous throughout the region.|$|E
5|$|The {{coastal areas}} {{bordering}} the Sea of Marmara, which connects the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea, have a transitional climate between a temperate Mediterranean climate and a temperate oceanic climate with warm to hot, moderately dry <b>summers</b> <b>and</b> cool to cold, wet winters. Snow {{falls on the}} coastal areas of the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea almost every winter, but usually melts in {{no more than a}} few days. However snow is rare in the coastal areas of the Aegean Sea and very rare in the coastal areas of the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E
5|$|The cover art for Amazing {{had been}} largely {{supplied}} by Ed Valigursky during the late fifties, but during the early sixties a much wider variety of artists appeared, including Alex Schomburg, Leo <b>Summers</b> <b>and</b> Ed Emshwiller. Frank Paul, who had painted all the covers {{for the first few}} years of Amazing, contributed a wraparound cover for the April 1961 35th anniversary issue; this was his last cover art for a science fiction magazine.|$|E

Hisar has a {{continental}} climate, with very hot <b>summers</b> <b>and</b> relatively cool winters. The most commonly spoken languages are Hindi, Haryanvi, and Bagri.|$|E
5|$|The mean annual {{temperatures}} in the Quebrada de Humahuaca valley range from , depending on altitude. In the Calchaquí Valleys in Salta Province, the climate is temperate and arid with large thermal amplitudes, long <b>summers,</b> <b>and</b> a long frost free period which varies by altitude. In both the Quebrada de Humahuaca and Calchaquí valleys, winters are cold with frosts that can occur between March and September.|$|E
5|$|The opera reached Australia in 1999, at the Sydney Opera House under Patrick <b>Summers,</b> <b>and</b> was {{performed}} there again in July–August 2005 under Trevor Pinnock, with Michael Chance as Rinaldo.
