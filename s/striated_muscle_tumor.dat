40|$|Abstract. An Appaloosa filly {{was born}} with a ventral midline, {{approximately}} 8 12 15 cm subcutaneous cervical mass. The nonencapsulated mass was composed of interlacing and haphazard bundles of spindle cells on moderate to abundant loose myxomatous stroma. A moderate number of cells showed cross striations with minor nuclear variation and a low mitotic rate. Immunohistochemical staining for myoglobin, desmin, actin, vimentin, and S- 100 was positive and negative for glial fibrillar antigen and keratin. Rhabdomyomas are rare benign tumors of striated muscle. Rhabdomyomas described previously in the veterinary literature are analogous to the ‘‘adult form’ ’ of human rhabdomyoma. This is the first report of a veterinary case that 1) clinically and histologically parallels the ‘‘fetal form’ ’ in human rhabdomyoma and 2) describes a congenital extracardiac rhabdomyoma. Key words: Cervical mass; fetal rhabdomyoma; foals; <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>tumor.</b> Benign tumors of striated muscle (rhabdomyomas) are rare in domestic animals and humans. 3 Rhabdomyomas {{have been reported in the}} dog, pig, cat, and horse at primary sites, including heart, larynx, diaphragm, and subcutis of the pin-na, abdomen, and extremities. 2, 6 – 8 Middle to old age animals are typically affected; however, reports of congential cardiac rhabdomyomas in pigs and a single case report of a dia-phragmatic rhabdomyoma in a 2 -year-old filly are notabl...|$|E

Discovery of bony metastases preceded detection of {{a rapidly growing}} intrathoracic mass, erroneously con-sidered a bronchiogenic carcinoma invading the heart. Changing murmurs, chest pain, transient arrhythmia, intermittent fever, and progressive weight loss were the outstanding clinical features. Necroscopy revealed a primary cardiac tumor with imetastases to pelvic bones. vertebrae, and lung, as well as malignant carcinoids and heterotopic pancreatic tissue. P RIMARY malignant <b>muscle</b> <b>tumors</b> of the heart are uncommon enough to war-rant reporting a single case. The tumor in our case we have classified as a myosarcoma, as it {{is closely related to}} the malignant <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> <b>tumors</b> of the heart but less differen-tiated. Only eight <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> sarcomas primary in the heart have been described. Leach, 12 reporting such a case, found in the literature 422 primary tumors of the heart and pericardium, of which 89 were sarcomas of different types. Whether the tumor in our case arose from the heart or pericardium could not be determined with certainty, but its origin was most likely in the posterior left ventricular or auricular wall. Although we were fortunate in being able to observe the patient for nine and one-half months before his death, the correct clinical diagnosis was not made. Since the clinical and pathologic findings are similar in many respects to those of the eight <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> sarcomas of the heart which have been described, we have included a brief summary of each of those cases for comparison...|$|R
40|$|Neoplasms of <b>striated</b> {{and smooth}} <b>muscle</b> in {{children}} are {{a diverse group}} of neoplasms that have some unique aspects in contrast to these tumors in adults. Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common soft tissue sarcoma of infancy and childhood and is relatively common in adolescents.

In recent years, the understanding of the pathologic and genetic aspects of rhabdomyosarcoma has been enhanced by adjunct techniques, such as immunohistochemistry and cytogenetic or molecular genetic analysis. The current classification of rhabdomyosarcoma emphasizes the histologic-prognostic correlations.

40|$|Striated {{muscles are}} present in bilaterian animals (for example, vertebrates, insects and annelids) and some non-bilaterian eumetazoans (that is, cnidarians and ctenophores). The {{considerable}} ultrastructural similarity of <b>striated</b> <b>muscles</b> between these animal groups is thought to reflect a common evolutionary origin. Here we show that a muscle protein core set, including a type II myosin heavy chain (MyHC) motor protein characteristic of <b>striated</b> <b>muscles</b> in vertebrates, was already present in unicellular organisms before the origin of multicellular animals. Furthermore, 2 ̆ 7 <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 non-muscle 2 ̆ 7 myhc orthologues are expressed differentially in two sponges, compatible with a functional diversification before the origin of true muscles and the subsequent use of <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> MyHC in fast-contracting smooth and <b>striated</b> <b>muscle.</b> Cnidarians and ctenophores possess <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> myhc orthologues but lack crucial components of bilaterian <b>striated</b> <b>muscles,</b> such as genes that code for titin and the troponin complex, suggesting the convergent evolution of <b>striated</b> <b>muscles.</b> Consistently, jellyfish orthologues of a shared set of bilaterian Z-disc proteins are not associated with <b>striated</b> <b>muscles,</b> but are instead expressed elsewhere or ubiquitously.

Two other characteristics that differentiate <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> from smooth muscle are the facts that the former has higher amounts of mitochondria and contains cells that are multinucleated.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAlthough general {{principles}} {{have been established}} in the regulation of vetebrate organogenesis, the specific molecules responsible for such signaling are just being identified. We have studied differentiation in the avian iris and ciliary body which undergoes a transition from smooth to <b>striated</b> <b>muscle.</b> Using heterochronic cocultures, {{we have found that}} <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> differentiation in pretransition (E 8) cells is induced by midtransition (E 11) cells through a secreted and soluble activity. In addition, contact-mediated mechanisms among pretransition cells prevented precocious <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> differentiation. We have tested the role of activin and its antagonist follistatin, as candidate regulators of this muscle transition. Activin induced smooth muscle differentiation while repressing <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> development. Conversely, follistatin promoted the emergence of <b>striated</b> <b>muscle,</b> while inhibiting smooth muscle differentiation. Significantly, secreted follistatin activity was found to increase during the smooth-to-striated muscle transition. Moreover, the <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> inducing activity from midtransition iris and ciliary body cell conditioned medium was depleted with an activin-affinity column which binds follistatin. These results suggest that activin and follistatin coordinate differentiation in the avian iris and ciliary body...|$|R
40|$|Cnidaria are {{the most}} basal animal phylum in which smooth and <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> cells have evolved. Since the {{ultrastructure}} of the mononucleated <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> {{is similar to that}} of higher animals, it is of interest to compare the <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> of Cnidaria at the molecular level to that of triploblastic phyla. We have used tropomyosins, a family of actin binding proteins to address this question. Throughout the animal kingdom, a great diversity of tropomyosin isoforms is found in non-muscle cells but only a few conserved tropomyosins are expressed in muscle cells. Muscle tropomyosins are all similar in length and share conserved termini. Two cnidarian tropomyosins have been described previously but neither of them is expressed in <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> cells. Here, we have characterized a new tropomyosin gene Tpm 2 from the hydrozoan Podocoryne caraea. Expression analysis by RT-PCR and by whole mount in situ hybridization demonstrate that Tpm 2 is exclusively expressed in <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> cells of the medusa. The Tpm 2 protein is shorter in length than its counterparts from higher animals and differs at both amino and carboxy termini from <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> isoforms of higher animals. Interestingly, Tpm 2 differs considerably from Tpm 1 (only 19 % identity) which was described previously in Podocoryne carnea. This divergence indicates a functional separation of cytoskeletal and <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> tropomyosins in cnidarians. These data contribute to our understanding of the evolution of the tropomyosin gene family and demonstrate the recruitment of tropomyosin into hydrozoan <b>striated</b> <b>muscles</b> during metazoan evolution.

However, the mechanisms of assembly and maintenance of sarcomeric actin filaments in <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> are not completely understood. Live imaging of actin in <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> has revealed that actin subunits within sarcomeric actin filaments are dynamically exchanged without altering overall sarcomeric structures. A number of regulators for actin dynamics have been identified, and malfunction of these regulators often result in disorganization of myofibril structures or muscle diseases. Therefore, proper regulation of actin dynamics in <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> is critical for assembly and maintenance of functional myofibrils.

40|$|Smooth and <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> alpha-tropomyosins differ as a {{consequence}} of alternative splicing of exons 2 and 9 encoding amino acid residues 39 - 80 and 258 - 284, respectively [Ruiz-Opazo, N., Weinberger, J. & Nadal-Ginard, B. (1985) Nature (London) 315, 67 - 70]. To understand the relationship between alternatively spliced exons and functional domains in tropomyosin, recombinant unacetylated <b>striated</b> <b>muscle,</b> smooth muscle, and chimeric rat alpha-tropomyosins (+H 3 N-tropomyosins) expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli were analyzed. The functional differences between the isoforms can be primarily ascribed to exon 9. +H 3 N-Tropomyosins with the smooth muscle exon 9 bound to skeletal muscle filamentous actin with at least a 5 -fold higher affinity than +H 3 N-tropomyosins with the <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> exon 9. On the other hand, in the presence of Ca 2 +, troponin increased the affinity of +H 3 N-tropomyosins with the <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> exon 9 at least 50 -fold, whereas it had little effect on +H 3 N-tropomyosins with the smooth muscle exon 9. The unique <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> alpha-tropomyosin exon 9 seems to be specialized for Ca(2 +) -insensitive interaction with troponin on the thin filament.

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of the muscular layers of the murine esophagus. Considerable controversy surrounds the manner in which the muscularis externa of the esophagus develops, ever since investigators proposed the rare phenomenon of transdifferentiation as a mechanism for virtually complete replacement of smooth <b>muscle</b> by <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> that is observed in the murine esophagus. I found, using several independent levels of evidence, that transdifferentiation is an unlikely explanation for esophageal myogenesis. First, by fate-mapping smooth muscle cells, I failed to observe expression of the fate-mapping marker in any esophageal <b>striated</b> <b>muscle.</b> Second, I failed to co-localize expression of smooth-muscle-specific and striated-muscle-specific proteins in any cell undergoing differentiation into a <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> lineage. Finally, selective deletion of a critical <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> transcription factor (myogenin) in esophageal smooth muscle cells prior to the appearance of any <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> failed to arrest subsequent esophageal striated myogenesis. To address prior concerns of the fate of esophageal smooth muscle, I examined smooth muscle morphology in transgenic mice expressing smoothmuscle-specific eGFP, and identified 3 possible fates: (A) the incorporation of smooth muscle cells into the <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> stroma as ?remnant? smooth muscles; (B) compaction and persistence of smooth muscle cells in the pre- gastric region; and (C) occasional apoptosis of smooth muscle cells. Using exhaustive co-immunolabeling methods, I demonstrated that remnant smooth muscle cells are indeed a previously unidentified cell population resident within the striated esophageal musculature. Finally, I examined the origin of <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> precursors in a series of ex vivo experiments. I was able to maintain a functional esophageal phenotype in culture for up to 7 days, and determined that <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> precursors most likely populate the esophageal muscularis externa early in development, and are subsequently induced to express a myogenic program in a craniocaudal direction. Together, these findings extend the understanding of esophageal myogenesis and redress fundamental concepts of myogenesis, namely, transdifferentiation, by providing evidence of a more simple, classical myogenic program in this unique muscular organ...|$|R
40|$|Muscle tissues are classically {{divided into}} two major types, {{depending}} on {{the presence or absence}} of striations. In <b>striated</b> <b>muscles,</b> the actin filaments are anchored at Z-lines and the myosin and actin filaments are in register, whereas in smooth muscles, the actin filaments are attached to dense bodies and the myosin and actin filaments are out of register. The structure of the filaments in smooth muscles is also different from that in <b>striated</b> <b>muscles.</b> Here we have studied the structure of myosin filaments from the smooth muscles of the human parasite Schistosoma mansoni. We find, surprisingly, that they are indistinguishable from those in an arthropod <b>striated</b> <b>muscle.</b> This structural similarity is supported by sequence comparison between the schistosome myosin II heavy chain and known <b>striated</b> <b>muscle</b> myosins. In contrast, the actin filaments of schistosomes are similar to those of smooth muscles, lacking troponin-dependent regulation. We conclude that schistosome muscles are hybrids, containing striated muscle-like myosin filaments and smooth muscle-like actin filaments in a smooth muscle architecture.
