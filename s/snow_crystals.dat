5|$|Ski wax {{enhances the}} ability of a ski or other runner to slide over snow, which depends on both the {{properties}} of the snow and the ski to result in an optimum amount of lubrication from melting the snow by friction with the ski—too little and the ski interacts with solid <b>snow</b> <b>crystals,</b> too much and capillary attraction of meltwater retards the ski. Before a ski can slide, it must overcome the maximum value static friction. Kinetic (or dynamic) friction occurs when the ski is moving over the snow.|$|E
5|$|The TDRS-1 {{program was}} overall less successful, with the {{satellite}} suffering several computer failures and an overall loss of telemetry for several hours. In all, the orbiter {{was able to}} use the satellite for 65 of the planned 89 orbits, and could make successful use of the connection on about forty. The Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System equipment functioned as planned, processing several hundred times more material than would have been possible on Earth, and the Asahi Shimbun crystal experiment, flown for the second time, was able to produce <b>snow</b> <b>crystals</b> after the canister was redesigned.|$|E

The second studied {{the effect of the}} gas environment around the orbiter using ultraviolet absorption measurements, as a precursor to ultraviolet equipment being designed for Spacelab 2. A third, sponsored by the Japanese Asahi Shimbun newspaper, tried to use water vapor in two tanks to create <b>snow</b> <b>crystals.</b> This was a second attempt at an experiment first flown on STS-6, which had had to be redesigned after the water in the tanks froze solid. The last was similar to an experiment flown on STS-3, and studied the ambient levels of atomic oxygen by measuring the rates at which small carbon and osmium wafers oxidized.|$|E
5|$|It {{also has}} a more {{extensive}} classification of deposited snow than those that pertain to airborne snow. The categories include both natural and man-made snow types, descriptions of <b>snow</b> <b>crystals</b> as they metamorphose and melt, the development of hoar frost in the snow pack {{and the formation of}} ice therein. Each such layer of a snowpack differs from the adjacent layers by one or more characteristics that describe its microstructure or density, which together define the snow type, and other physical properties. Thus, at any one time, the type and state of the snow forming a layer have to be defined because its physical and mechanical properties depend on them. Physical properties include microstructure, grain size and shape, snow density, liquid water content, and temperature.|$|E

25|$|Age: Reflects the {{metamorphosis}} of <b>snow</b> <b>crystals</b> {{that are}} sharp and well-defined, when new, but with aging become broken or truncated with wind action or rounded into ice granules with freeze-thaw, {{all of which}} affects a ski's coefficient of friction.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability of}} a ski or other runner to slide over snow depends on both the {{properties}} of the snow and the ski to result in an optimum amount of lubrication from melting the snow by friction with the ski—too little and the ski interacts with solid <b>snow</b> <b>crystals,</b> too much and capillary attraction of meltwater retards the ski.|$|E
25|$|These factors {{contribute}} to the metamorphism of snow, i.e. the process of reshaping <b>snow</b> <b>crystals</b> into smaller, more rounded ice grains, which in turn consolidates and settles the snow pack. Increased density increases strength by joining of grains though sintering and freezing of melted water. New-fallen snow may have a density of 150 - 200kg/m3. Whereas a snowmobile can pack snow to a density of 300 - 350kg/m3, the densities required for recreational trails are 450kg/m3 and for racing, 500kg/m3 or higher.|$|E

25|$|A {{variety of}} glide waxes are {{tailored}} for specific temperature ranges and other snow properties with varying wax hardness and other properties that address repellence of moisture and dirt. The hardness of the glide wax affects the melting {{of the snow}} to lubricate its passage over the surface {{and its ability to}} avoid suction from meltwater in the snow. Too little melting and sharp edges of <b>snow</b> <b>crystals</b> or too much suction impede the passage of the ski. A tipping point between where crystal type dominates sliding friction and moisture content dominates occurs around 26°F. Harder waxes address colder, drier or more abrasive snow conditions, whereas softer waxes have a lower coefficient of friction, but abrade more readily. Wax formulations combine three types of wax to adjust coefficient of friction and durability. From hard to soft, they include synthetic waxes with 50 or more carbon atoms, microcrystalline waxes with 25 to 50 carbon atoms and paraffin waxes with 20 to 35 carbon atoms. Additives to such waxes include graphite, teflon, silicon, fluorocarbons, and molybdenum to improve glide and/or reduce dirt accumulation.|$|E
25|$|Snowflakes have a {{wide range}} of shapes, even as they fall; among these are: six-sided star-like dendrites, {{hexagonal}} needles, platelets and icy pellets. Once snow accumulates on the ground, the flakes immediately begin to undergo transformation (called metamorphosis), owing to temperature changes, sublimation, and mechanical action. Temperature changes may be from the ambient temperature, solar radiation, rainwater, wind, or the temperature of the material beneath the snow layer. Mechanical action includes wind and compaction. Over time, bulk snow tends to consolidate—its crystals become truncated from breaking apart or losing mass with sublimation directly from solid to gas and with freeze-thaw, causing them to combine as coarse and granular ice crystals. Colbeck reports that fresh, cold, and man-made snow all interact more directly with the base of a ski and increase friction, indicating the use of harder waxes. Conversely, older, warmer, and denser snows present lower friction, in part due to increased grain size, which better promotes a water film and a smoother surface of the <b>snow</b> <b>crystals</b> for which softer waxes are indicated.|$|E
25|$|While the {{deterministic}} {{relationship between}} snowpack characteristics and snowpack stability {{is still a}} matter of ongoing scientific study, {{there is a growing}} empirical understanding of the snow composition and deposition characteristics that influence the likelihood of an avalanche. Observation and experience has shown that newly fallen snow requires time to bond with the snow layers beneath it, especially if the new snow falls during very cold and dry conditions. If ambient air temperatures are cold enough, shallow snow above or around boulders, plants, and other discontinuities in the slope, weakens from rapid crystal growth that occurs {{in the presence of a}} critical temperature gradient. Large, angular <b>snow</b> <b>crystals</b> are indicators of weak snow, because such crystals have fewer bonds per unit volume than small, rounded crystals that pack tightly together. Consolidated snow is less likely to slough than loose powdery layers or wet isothermal snow; however, consolidated snow is a necessary condition for the occurrence of slab avalanches, and persistent instabilities within the snowpack can hide below well-consolidated surface layers. Uncertainty associated with the empirical understanding of the factors influencing snow stability leads most professional avalanche workers to recommend conservative use of avalanche terrain relative to current snowpack instability.|$|E

The problems feature a fully anisotropic Gibbs–Thomson law, as well as kinetic undercooling. Our approximation, which couples a parametric approximation of the moving boundary with a finite element approximation of the bulk quantities, can be shown to satisfy a stability bound, and it enjoys very good mesh properties which means that no mesh smoothing is necessary in practice. In our numerical computations we concentrate on the simulation of <b>snow</b> <b>crystal</b> growth.

40|$|Abstract. Polarization {{capabilities}} of 8. 66 -mm-wavelength radar and corresponding hydrometeor depolarization calculations now {{provide the basis}} for identifying individual types of ice and liquid hydrometeors within clouds and precipitation. Model results and radar measurements with correlated <b>snow</b> <b>crystal</b> samples from winter stratiform and convective orographic clouds are examined. The results are interpreted to illustrate how this method for estimating hydrometeor types can be applied to monitor cloud evolution and evaluate the potentials and effects of glaciogenic cloud seeding. This information is derived from hydrometeor depolarizations (and related cloud reflectivities) associated with cloud phase transition, <b>snow</b> <b>crystal</b> growth habit, graupel development, <b>snow</b> <b>crystal</b> aggregation, the presence and nature of the melting level, and the distinction of rain from drizzle below the melting level. The radar’s polarization capability offers the opportunity to monitor the development of hydrometeors in the volume of cloud affected by seeding or by natural processes. Spatial gradients in hydrometeor types, rates at which a volume is transformed, and the form of precipitation can also be estimated. These features are all important for verifying the changes in hydrometeors introduced by seeding and interpreting the rates and mechanisms by which the changes occur. 1...|$|R
