50|$|Los Santos {{is home to}} five of {{the seven}} monkeys species living in Panama, some of them {{critically}} endangered: <b>Saguinus</b> <b>geoffroyi,</b> Azuero Howler Monkey, Azuero Spider Monkey, Western Capuchin Monkey and Aloutta palliata.|$|R
50|$|There is high {{diversity}} of fauna in the Chocó-Darién moist forests ecoregion, and many endemic species.The extremely high rainfall {{makes it difficult}} for many vertebrates to travel, forming gap in the distribution of several primates and other mammals.Vulnerable or endangered mammal species include Geoffroy's tamarin (<b>Saguinus</b> <b>geoffroyi),</b> giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), cougar (Puma concolor), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) and jaguar (Panthera onca).Other endangered mammals include black-headed spider monkey (Ateles fusciceps), Geoffroy's spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi), Gorgas's rice rat (Oryzomys gorgasi) and Baird's tapir (Tapirus bairdii).|$|R
50|$|The Eastern Panamanian montane forests ecoregion, {{situated}} on the land bridge between the Americas, and with different elevations and climates, has diverse fauna.Species {{from the north and}} south have mixed, and endemic species have appeared.Darien Province has about 770 species of vertebrates.Primates are gray-bellied night monkey (Aotus lemurinus - at the northern end of its range), Geoffroy's spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi),black-headed spider monkey (Ateles fusciceps), Geoffroy's tamarin (<b>Saguinus</b> <b>geoffroyi</b> - endemic to Costa Rica, Panama and northwest Colombia), mantled howler (Alouatta palliata) and white-headed capuchin (Cebus capucinus).Cats are cougar (Puma concolor),jaguar (Panthera onca), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), margay (Leopardus wiedii), jaguarundi (Puma yagouaroundi) and oncilla (Leopardus tigrinus).Endangered mammals include black-headed spider monkey, Geoffroy's spider monkey and Baird's tapir (Tapirus bairdii).|$|R
25|$|Males that {{compete for}} more mating {{opportunities}} {{are the ones}} that have shown less cooperation in breeding. However, there are other males that in order to gain access to females and mating opportunities practice parental care. Such parental care is mostly seen in polyandrous mating systems; but they must go through the cost of sharing paternity and parental care. This has been observed in avians like acorn woodpeckers (Melanerpes formicivorus), and fishes as the cichlid fish (Julidochromis transcriptus). Observations that show male relatedness suggest the importance for male social relationships in taking care of offspring. These social relationships in males are seen in primates, Geoffroy's tamarins, <b>Saguinus</b> <b>geoffroyi.</b> High proportions of related males at the half sibling or higher were found.|$|R
50|$|Geoffroy's tamarin (<b>Saguinus</b> <b>geoffroyi),</b> {{also known}} as the Panamanian, red-crested or rufous-naped tamarin, is a tamarin, a type of small monkey, found in Panama and Colombia. It is {{predominantly}} black and white, with a reddish nape. Diurnal, Geoffroy's tamarin spends most of its time in trees, but does come down to the ground occasionally. It lives in groups that most often number between three and five individuals, and generally include one or more adults of each sex. It eats a variety of foods, including insects, exudates, fruits and other plant parts. Insects and fruits account for the majority of its diet, but exudates are also important. But since its teeth are not adapted for gouging trees to get to the sap, it can only eat exudates when they are easily available.|$|R
40|$|The role of {{physical}} barriers in promoting population divergence and genetic structuring is well known. While {{it is well}} established that animals can show genetic structuring at small spatial scales, less well-resolved is how {{the timing of the}} appearance of barriers affects population structure. This study uses the Panama Canal watershed as a test of the effects of old and recent riverine barriers in creating population structure in <b>Saguinus</b> <b>geoffroyi,</b> a small cooperatively breeding Neotropical primate. Mitochondrial sequences and microsatellite genotypes from three sampling localities revealed genetic structure across the Chagres River and the Panama Canal, suggesting that both waterways act as barriers to gene flow. F-statistics and exact tests of population differentiation suggest population structure on either side of both riverine barriers. Genetic differentiation across the Canal, however, was less than observed across the Chagres. Accordingly, Bayesian clustering algorithms detected between two and three populations, with localities across the older Chagres River always assigned as distinct populations. While conclusions represent a preliminary assessment of genetic structure of S. geoffroyi, this study adds to the evidence indicating that riverine barriers create genetic structure across a wide variety of taxa in the Panama Canal watershed and highlights the potential of this study area for discerning modern from historical influences on observed patterns of population genetic structure...|$|R
40|$|An {{influential}} hypothesis {{proposed by}} Greenwood (1980) suggests that different mating systems result in female and male-biased dispersal, respectively, in birds and mammals. However, {{other aspects of}} social structure and behavior can also shape sex-biased dispersal. Although sex-specific patterns of kin cooperation are expected to affect the benefits of philopatry and dispersal patterns, empirical evidence is scarce. Unlike many mammals, <b>Saguinus</b> <b>geoffroyi</b> (Geoffroy’s tamarin) has a breeding system in which typically multiple males mate with a single breeding female. Males typically form cooperative reproductive partnerships between relatives, whereas females generally compete for reproductive opportunities. This system of cooperative polyandry is predicted to result in female-biased dispersal, providing an opportunity to test the current hypotheses of sex-biased dispersal. Here we test for evidence of sex-biased dispersal in S. geoffroyi using demographic and genetic data from three populations. We find no sex bias in natal dispersal, contrary to the prediction based on the mating patterns. This pattern was consistent after controlling {{for the effects of}} historical population structure. Limited breeding opportunities within social groups likely drive both males and females to disperse, suggesting that dispersal is intimately related to the social context. The integration of genetic and field data revealed that tamarins are another exception to the presumed pattern of male-biased dispersal in mammals. A shift in focus from mating systems to social behavior, which plays a role in most all processes expected to influence sex-bias in dispersal, will be a fruitful target for research both within species and across taxa...|$|R
40|$|Many {{correlational}} {{studies have}} been conducted on mixed species primate groups and sympatric species, and evolutionary theory has been advanced to understand interspecies interactions. However, few experimental field {{studies have been}} conducted to determine causal influences of one primate species on another. In this paper, we describe an experimental field study focused on the effects of mantled howler monkeys (Alouatta palliata) on rufous-naped tamarins (<b>Saguinus</b> <b>geoffroyi).</b> Two juvenile howler monkeys were placed on a small island with 5 tamarins in an A-B- A 2 -B 2 experimental design: A-baseline with no howlers present, B-experimental condition with howlers present, A 2 -second baseline with no howlers, and B 2 -second experimental condition with howlers present. Systematic focal sample data were collected on the tamarins' feeding patterns, their height in the forest, their distance from the nearest howler, the height of the howlers, and agonistic interactions between the two species. The presence of the howlers appeared to slightly decrease the tamarins' rate of feeding on provisioned and natural food. This effect diminished during the second experimental condition. There were few agonistic interactions between the species and no wounding or deterioration in the condition of either species was observed. The tamarins shifted early morning and mid-day feeding patterns later when the howlers were present. There was a faint tendency for the tamarins to be higher in the trees when the howlers were present. Analyses of the relationships between the variables suggest the tamarins and the howlers were simultaneously attracted to the same provisioned and natural food items. This led to synchrony in their use of vertical space. Early in the day, when provisioned food was more freq [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The Geoffroy's cat Leopardus geoffroyi (d'Orbigny & Gervais, 1844) {{is a small}} cat {{found in}} the Southern Cone of South America and, {{depending}} on the author, four or five subspecies have been usually recognized (L. g. geoffroyi, L. g. paraguae, L. g. euxanthus, L. g. salinarum and L. g. leucobaptus), mainly based on external morphological characters, such as color pattern of the pelage. In order to clarify the taxonomy of L. <b>geoffroyi,</b> <b>I</b> analyzed approximately 200 specimens housed in museums. I have examined the external and craniodental morphology in quantitative and qualitative terms {{in the search for}} patterns of congruent characters that would indicate the existence of taxonomic units. Twenty craniodental measurements were taken and tested by univariate and multivariate (MANOVA, PCA and DFA) procedures. In this study I detected a great variation in the morphological characters, and thus {{it was not possible to}} determine whether any of these were geographically consistent and could be used to determine any taxonomic unit. Based on this, I do not recognize any subspecific division for L. geoffroyi. Along its geographic range, a gradual and subtle change from one color pattern to the next along the latitude was detected, but the morphological characters that were used to define the putative subspecies were also detected in a same population. Furthermore, the present study is congruent with the results obtained by previous molecular data, suggesting that L. geoffroyi has a high level of genetic diversity with no geographic structure. This indicates the existence of a large panmictic population with no significant barriers to gene flow and, as a consequence, no subspecies should be recognized...|$|R
40|$|Cooperative {{behavior}} in reproductive contexts is rare among animals, especially males. Tamarins exhibit a rare breeding system called cooperative polyandry, {{in which a}} single breeding female mates with two or more males to produce fraternal twins and the males cooperate in caring for the infants by carrying young for the first 10 weeks of their lives. This peculiar breeding system {{raises questions about the}} adaptive consequences of male behavior. The nature of the breeding system also prompts questions about the ecological context and genetic consequences of this social organization. My research attempted address fundamental questions in behavior, ecology and evolutionary biology through the lens of individual behavior. Tamarins oftentimes inhabit disturbed habitats, however detailed space use within fragmented habitats is not well characterized. I used fine scale spatial and behavioral data in order to quantify habitat preference of S. geoffroyi in a heterogenous urban-forest landscape in central Panama. Using home range- based analyses and a novel method, first passage time analysis, I showed that tamarins spend significantly more time in secondary forest habitat {{and are more likely to}} forage and engage in social {{behavior in}} forest as compared to human-modified habitats. 	I examined the role of two aquatic barriers of varying age in creating population genetic structure in S. <b>geoffroyi.</b> <b>I</b> found that there was significant population differentiation across the Chagres River, an older, established riverine barrier and smaller, but detectable population structure across the Panama Canal, a recent anthropogenic riverine barrier. Finally, I examined the possible adaptive benefits of cooperative male parental care using genetic analyses of paternity and relatedness. I found that males in a group are often related and that they share paternity over multi-year associations. My results suggest that indirect and direct fitness benefits may play a role in maintaining male-male cooperation in tamarins...|$|R
40|$|Animals {{living in}} groups are {{frequently}} exposed to {{conflicts of interest}} which can escalate into aggression. Aggressive interactions may be a means to resolve incompatibility among objectives. Nevertheless, aggression may undermine the benefits of group living by disrupting the relationships between opponents. Thus, conflict management mechanisms have evolved {{to cope with the}} potential damage brought about by aggressive interactions. The aim of my thesis was to investigate the mechanisms to prevent aggressive escalation and to mitigate its negative consequences in 2 communities of wild spider monkeys (Ateles <b>geoffroyi</b> yucanensis). <b>I</b> also examined the factors, such as relationship characteristics, affecting the occurrence of these mechanisms. Spider monkeys live in communities {{with a high degree of}} fission fusion dynamics in which individuals frequently split and merge into subgroups of variable composition. The implications of this social system for conflict management were also explored. To characterise spider monkeys’ social relationships, two components were identified and labelled compatibility and risk. These components were further related to relationship characteristics, such as kinship, sex combinations, and tenure in the community. Kin had more compatible relationships than non kin, but there was no difference for risk. Male-male dyads were characterised as being significantly more compatible and riskier than either female-female dyads or male-female dyads. Furthermore, individuals with longer tenure had riskier relationships than individuals with shorter tenure. Among the post-conflict management mechanisms spider monkeys did not engage in reconciliation, redirected aggression, or bystander affiliation. However, an option afforded by their high degree of fission fusion dynamics was used in the aftermath of aggression. Fission from former aggressors was more likely to occur within one hour of the aggressive conflicts than in control periods. Furthermore, individuals sharing riskier and less compatible relationships had significantly shorter latencies to fission compared to those with less risky and more compatible relationships. These patterns suggest that fission may function to reduce the possibility of renewed aggression and cope with increased post-conflict anxiety. Indeed, anxiety levels were higher in the recipients of aggression during the first 5 post-conflict minutes compared to baseline levels. Whereas fission may be a mechanism to cope with the negative consequences of aggressive escalation, fusion of subgroups could lead to uncertainty and hostility. Indeed, aggression increased in the first five post-fusion minutes compared to baseline levels. There was also an increase in post-fusion friendly behaviours, which may function as signals of good intentions. This view was confirmed as post-fusion aggression was reduced when friendly behaviours took place. In addition, shorter latencies of post-fusion aggression and friendly behaviours were found between individuals with riskier relationships compared to those with less risky relationships. Prevention of aggressive conflicts may also be achieved by adjusting subgroup size to the availability of feeding resources thereby reducing competition. The effectiveness of this flexible adjustment was demonstrated during a period of drastic reduction in food sources caused by two consecutive hurricanes at the field site. Mean subgroup size and fusion rates were significantly reduced in the post-hurricane compared to pre-hurricane periods. Hence, my thesis adds to the study of social relationships and conflict management in non-human animals by making several contributions. I provided the first evidence of relationship components in new world monkeys. I then examined the potential of fission-fusion dynamics as a means to manage conflicts among community members. I was the first demonstrating that fission is a post-conflict mechanism. Fission from the former aggressor was especially used by individuals with riskier and less compatible relationships. Subgroup fusion increased aggressive conflicts, especially between individuals with riskier relationships, but post-fusion friendly behaviours reduced them. The effectiveness of fission-fusion dynamics in conflict management was further demonstrated by how the spider monkeys coped with the potential increase in conflict among community members due to a dramatic reduction in food supplies due to two hurricanes. Overall, spider monkeys appear to deal with conflicts using the full range of the flexible social options afforded by their social system.
