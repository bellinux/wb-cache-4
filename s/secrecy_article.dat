Of these cases, 120 are related to not observing the <b>secrecy</b> of investigation (<b>Article</b> 285/1-3 of the Turkish Penal Code). In 17 cases the charges are influencing fair trial; in 30 cases the charges are insulting institutions (Article 125/3 of the Turkish Penal Code). In connection with an article on the killing of Üzeyir Garih that was allegedly committed by Ergenekon the editor-in-chief Ahmet Can Karahasanoğlu was sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment according to Article 285/1 of the Turkish Penal Code for having violated the duty to observe <b>secrecy.</b> The <b>article</b> had been published on 1 October 2008. Relating to the attack of PKK militants on the gendarmerie station Dağlıca in Yüksekova district, Hakkâri Province on 21 October 2007 Bakırköy Penal Code 2 once again sentenced Ahmet Can Karahasanoğlu to 15 months' imprisonment for having violated the duty to observe secrecy.|$|R

Since the 1970 ’s, leaks of state secrets have played {{an essential role}} in holding the American government to account for its use of <b>secrecy.</b> This <b>article</b> uses the Wikileaks affair to shed light on the need for and the the limits of [...] . leaks, when they are used to promote transparency in the name of democracy. The specific nature of state secrets and their ambiguous relation to democracy condition the democratic value of leaks. It is only on the basis of such an appraisal that the apparent tensions between the defence of democracy and the preservation of national security be reconciled...|$|R
40|$|For {{many decades}} South African law has {{recognised}} a bank's duty {{to keep its}} client's information confidential. This is popularly known as bank secrecy. However, this duty is not absolute. National and international law provide for circumstances in which a bank may disclose information relating to a client. The UN Convention against Corruption, which South Africa ratified in 2004, has three Articles which deal directly {{with the issue of}} bank <b>secrecy,</b> namely, <b>Articles</b> 31 (7), 40 and 46 (8). The purpose of this essay is to discuss whether South Africa has measures in place to give effect to Articles 31 (7), 40 and 46 (8) of the UN Convention against Corruption...|$|R
40|$|Spanish Golden Age Culture is an age {{of secrets}} and secrecy. Among its playwrights, Pedro Calderón de la Barca shows the most complex {{comprehension}} of this subject. During the entirety of his career he refers to it in numerous comedies, creates metaphors concerning different aspects of secrecy and employs it {{for the construction of}} his comedias de enredo/comedies of intrigue. In summary: Calderón has an ongoing interest in this anthropological phenomenon. The article analyses the motive of secrecy in selected plays, tragic and comic, starting with the San Secreto figure present in different plays, for example in La vida es sueño. After tracing the temporal aspect of <b>secrecy</b> the <b>article</b> ends with some thoughts about the relation between the public and the secret spheres. Calderón reflects this relation in his masterpiece concerning secrecy: El secreto a voces/The loud secret...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyzes}} why late nineteenth- {{and early}} twentieth-century German and German-American high-technology firms were presented as being overly secretive in chemical {{circles in the}} United States. It suggests that German chemical companies did not just develop innovative uses of the patent system, but also pioneered intellectual property strategies of which both patenting and secrecy were important components. Focusing on two German-American firms, Mallinckrodt Chemical Works and Roessler & Hasslacher, the study relates statements on restrictive knowledge management and intellectual property practices of German companies to transatlantic institutional differences. It points to a dissonance between the persistent association of German high-technology enterprises with secrecy and the actual directions in which the German and American systems of corporate intellectual property were moving {{in the early twentieth}} century. By highlighting different complementary uses of patenting and <b>secrecy,</b> the <b>article</b> also challenges the still-common idea that these two knowledge management strategies are mutually exclusive...|$|R

40|$|Patent law - and {{innovation}} policy more generally - {{has traditionally been}} conceptualized as antithetical to secrecy. Not only does the patent system require inventors to publicly disclose their inventions {{in order to receive}} a patent, but various patent doctrines are designed to encourage inventors to forego trade <b>secrecy.</b> This <b>Article</b> offers a critique of the law’s preference for patents. In particular, this Article examines whether and under what circumstances the law should prefer patents over secrets, and vice versa. As an initial step towards a theoretically-supported system of inventor incentives, this Article constructs a framework that attempts to balance the public trade-offs of patenting and secrecy. Theoretically, the framework is based upon the insight that the fundamental economic rationale for the existence of the patent system - overcoming the market failure of informational public goods - is inapplicable when secrecy is viable. The framework highlights scenarios in which innovation can be advanced by encouraging secrecy, rather than patenting. The Article concludes by suggesting changes to current law that would encourage inventor use of secrecy, when appropriate...|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} social {{frameworks}} guiding expert and nonexpert perspectives on medicines {{safety in the}} U. K. Scientific experts from the Committee on the Safety of Medicines and the Medicines Commission were interviewed, and three nonexpertgroups, including patients and health professionals, were studied by the administration of questionnaires and focused group discussions. The research examined to what extent these groups subscribed to technocratic or democratic approaches to medicines regula tion and how this {{might be related to}} values toward technological risk. The results reveal that there is substantial divergence between expert and nonexpert perspectives on medicines regulation, and that this derives as much from value differences as from any informational deficits. However, {{there seems to be some}} scope for shared values between some experts and some nonexperts, especially as regards state <b>secrecy.</b> The <b>article</b> concludes by discussing how those values could be used to foster a new "social contract of expertise" in which scientists are more democratically accountable and patients take more responsibility in governing medical risks...|$|R
40|$|Those {{who like}} to pay tax are few. Accordingly, income tax is often {{described}} as a shame. Of course, the right to enjoyment of property is at stake in the matters of taxation. And the collection of taxation involves also other aspects of the right to substantive and procedural due process of law : right to privacy, to be heard, to unbiassed decision, to professional <b>secrecy</b> [...] . This <b>article</b> contrasts these rights, as they are expressed in sections 5 to 9 and 23 of the Charte des droits et libertés de la personne of Québec and section 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom, with sections 13 to 16 and 38 and following of the Loi sur le ministère du revenu of Québec and sections 159, 231 and 232 of the Canadian Income Tax Act. It finds that it is the application of the income tax law, more than the law itself, that threatens human rights. It concludes that the main benefit of both Charters of rights is to provide a shelter from such unreasonnable applicatio...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- The {{fundamental}} {{function of}} the network security protocols is to allow the authorized participant to communicate with others securely over the insecure network. Point-to-point packet transmission {{is the most common}} way of the communication over the network. However, it is not appropriate for many emerging applications such as message services, pay-TV, teleconference, or collaborate tasks. It is due to that these applications are structured on the group communication. Consequently, point-to-group or group-to-group packet transmission has become an important issue of the network in recent periods. In 2004, Aslan proposed a scalable multicast security protocol using a subgroup-key hierarchy. Aslan’s protocol allows the user to communicate with others efficiently. Nevertheless, we find that each communicating user in the system has to maintain many secret keys such that it is not convenient for all users. Besides, while a member joins or leaves the communicating group, lots of involved participants have to change their secret keys to confirm the forward secrecy and the backward <b>secrecy.</b> In this <b>article,</b> we propose an improved multicast security protocol which not only preserves the functionality of Aslan’s protocol but also possesses the performance better than other related works. Key-Words:- multicast communication, scalability, secret key, hierarch...|$|R
50|$|<b>Secrecy</b> of {{communication}} (<b>Article</b> 13). Subarticle 1 contains {{the privacy of}} correspondence. This can only be violated on order of a judge and only in those cases indicated by formal law. No delegation is allowed. The judge in question is rarely a court but in practice the investigative judge (rechter-commissaris). The Dutch penal code offers a further protection of this right as several types of violating it are punishable as crimes. Subarticle 2 contains the privacy {{of communication}} by telephone and telegraph. This right can be limited by law; such law has to indicate which persons {{have the authority to}} allow a violation. No delegation is allowed. For most cases again the investigative judge has the competent authority. Since the nineties there is doctrinal consensus that the right extends to cell phone communication, but earlier this was contended. In practice the Dutch police taps any telephone communication at will, irrespective of authorisation and with full cooperation of the telephone companies. Although this situation is embarrassing from a constitutional point of view, authorities and courts are hesitant to act against it, for reasons of practicality. However, it has often been ruled that information thus gained cannot be admissible as evidence in court.|$|R
40|$|The {{content of}} {{administered}} public school exams, modifications {{made by a}} government to its voting machines, and the business strategies of government corporations should {{be of interest to}} the public. At a minimum, they are the kinds of information that a government should allow its citizens to see and examine. After all, the public might have some legitimate questions for its government: Is that public school examination fair and accurate? Is that voting machine working so that my vote gets counted? To whom or what is that government agency marketing and are kickbacks involved? One would think that the government should have to publicly answer such questions, at least in a democracy. While initially the above does not sound too controversial, state law has made it problematic. Getting access to the information that would answer the above questions may not be easy because the person requesting the information may have to show that the information is not a government trade secret before it can be disclosed. Today, the government of the people can keep information from the people by way of the commercial, intellectual property law of trade secrecy. Strangely, the people [...] citizens of states and the United States [...] apparently have trade secrets that they themselves cannot see. In other words, there is information that the government itself creates on its own (a 2 ̆ 2 government trade secret 2 ̆ 2) and that courts and attorneys general have found meet the applicable definition of a trade secret. This Article examines whether a government trade secret should be allowed to exist and, if so, whether governments should be allowed to shield government trade secrets from public disclosure. Importantly, I am not focusing here on trade secrets shared with government by private industry or created by private industry on the public 2 ̆ 7 s dime. That topic was the focus of an earlier <b>article,</b> <b>Secrecy</b> and Unaccountability: Trade Secrets in Our Public Infrastructure (2 ̆ 2 Secrecy 2 ̆ 2). In Secrecy, I examined the question of whether private entities engaged in the provision of public infrastructure, like voting machines and public Wi-Fi Internet access, should be allowed to shield information regarding their products and services from public disclosure by way of trade secrecy. This is a question of applying democratic values like transparency and accountability to private entities, the practical effect of which is in direct conflict with the purpose of trade secrecy, namely, keeping commercial information private. I concluded that, as applied to public infrastructure, trade secrecy should not be utilized by private entities engaged in its provision. While the conflict here is similar [...] transparency versus secrecy [...] the policy considerations are quite different. For example: do we need to incentivize innovation in government by way of trade secrecy? Should the government {{be in the business of}} leveraging competitive advantage in order to generate revenue or, much worse, for an unstated ulterior motive like avoiding public scrutiny? If the government is allowed to consider cost-effectiveness in its operations, should trade secrecy be the mechanism that allows for this consideration? As the application of trade secrecy by government is a very recent development (at least in the United States) and there are very few reported decisions dealing with the issue, its ramifications have yet to be explored in detail. I examine these questions and issues by explaining how trade secrecy and freedom of information laws interact, emphasizing the theoretically discordant nature of the government trade secret. In Part I, I examine the basic issues involved in finding and maintaining a trade secret. In Part II, I discuss several scenarios where government trade secrets have been asserted with questionable basis in the law, such as a county 2 ̆ 7 s modification of voting machines, or where government trade secrecy has prevented the public from accessing valuable information, such as a public school system 2 ̆ 7 s examinations and the minutes of public corporation board meetings. Additionally, I posit reasons why the problem of government trade secrets may be growing. In Part III, I outline the basic principles of transparency, accountability, and democratic governance. In Part IV I discuss possible solutions to the problems discussed, and conclude that trade secrecy is a poor fit in government for two primary reasons: (a) the utilitarian basis for trade secrecy does not fit well when applied to government, and (b) transparency and accountability, two core democratic values, are severely undermined when trade secrecy is used to prevent disclosure of otherwise public information...|$|R
