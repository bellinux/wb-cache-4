30|$|The main {{limitation}} of this study derives from not considering all Iberian <b>seaports</b> in the analysis and hence preventing any conclusions onsmaller <b>seaports.</b> Therefore, the conclusions presented here are limited to the selected sample of the most representative Iberian <b>seaports.</b> As DEA analysis calculates the efficiency based on the selected DMU’s, the results probably would be different if the sample was different. In this sense, we would suggest the study be applied to all Iberian <b>seaports.</b> We would also recommend that the study be applied to the same <b>seaports</b> for the period since 2009 to analyse and compare i) the effects of the global financial crisisand the recovery, or otherwise, of <b>seaports,</b> ii) the effect of the latest restructurings, for example, Aveiro <b>seaport’s</b> link to the national railway network, operational in 2010, provides for the movement of around 600, 000  t, and iii) the effects of the enlargement of the Panama Canal from 2013 that will impact on the world’s shipping routes and the positioning of Iberian <b>seaports.</b>|$|R

40|$|International <b>seaports</b> are {{hotspots}} {{for disease}} invasion and pathogens can persist in <b>seaports</b> even after ports are abandoned. Transmitted by fleas infected by Rickettsia typhi, murine typhus, a largely neglected and easily misdiagnosed disease, {{is known to}} occur primarily in large <b>seaports.</b> However, the significance of <b>seaports</b> in the occurrence of murine typhus has never been validated quantitatively. We studied the spatial distribution of murine typhus, a notifiable disease, in Taiwan. We investigated whether risk of infection was correlated with distance to international <b>seaports</b> {{and a collection of}} environmental and socioeconomic factors, using a Bayesian negative binomial conditionally autoregressive model, followed with geographically weighted regression. <b>Seaports</b> that are currently in use and those that operated in the 19 th century for trade with China, but were later abandoned due to siltation were analyzed. A total of 476 human cases of murine typhus were reported during 2000 - 2014 in the main island of Taiwan, with spatial clustering in districts in southwest and central-west Taiwan. A higher incidence rate (case/population) was associated with a smaller distance to currently in-use international <b>seaports</b> and lower rainfall and temperature, but was uncorrelated with distance to abandoned ports. Geographically weighted regression revealed a geographic heterogeneity in the importance of distance to in-use <b>seaports</b> near the four international <b>seaports</b> of Taiwan. Our study suggests that murine typhus is associated with international <b>seaports,</b> especially for those with large trading volume. Thus, one of the costs of global trade in Taiwan might be elevated risks of murine typhus. Globalization has accelerated the spread of infectious diseases, but the burden of disease varies geographically, with regions surrounding major international <b>seaports</b> warranting particular surveillance...|$|R

30|$|Within this perspective, {{this paper}} {{presents}} the efficiency analysis of the top-ten Iberian <b>seaports</b> using a DEA approach. This paper has explored the alternative “Four-stage” DEA methods develop by Park and De (35).

All <b>seaports</b> in the two models return a 100  % profitability score. In terms of overall efficiency, the <b>seaports</b> of Leixões, Setúbal, Algeciras, Barcelona and Tarragona attain a 100  % efficiency score, meaning they performed the best amongst this group and represent benchmark reference <b>seaports</b> on the Iberian Peninsula.|$|R
40|$|The book {{discusses}} the potential development of <b>seaports</b> {{in the context}} of Digitalization. Major challenges of and business opportunities for <b>seaports</b> arising from the megatrend Digitalization and prerequisites that need to be fulfilled to seize these opportunities are described. Major trends are technological innovations, globalization, demographic change, urbanization, and sustainability as well as port management trends. Digitizing processes in and between <b>seaports</b> leads to a network of <b>seaports</b> that transfers the smartPORT concept to the entire maritime logistics chain, meaning the collaboration and connection of individual Smart Ports. This enables a better handling of complexity. The network is supposed to interlink information and data between participating ports, creating a breeding ground to jointly develop future-oriented and innovative solutions and digital business models within a value creating network. Using scenarios for the future development of <b>seaports</b> the reader gets an impression on how digitized <b>seaports</b> could look like. These scenarios are (1) Maritime transport; (2) Transhipment and hinterland transport; (3) Infrastructure and energy; (4) New business models...|$|R
40|$|The paper proposes an {{approach}} to better integrate logistics hubs into freight transport modelling. We will do this for the particular case of <b>seaports</b> and concentrate in the empirical section on German ports. In current freight transport models <b>seaports</b> are handled as ‘singular transport generators’. The freight traffic flow for <b>seaports</b> is directly inserted into the models and is not generated by the implementation of attributes or indicators. There {{are only a few}} approaches of integrating logistics in freight transport models. They are using the supply chain or supply chain elements for the integration of logistics. None of the models analysed integrate logistics hubs in freight transport models. We will show how to differentiate logistics hubs, which data on logistics hubs especially on <b>seaports</b> are available and which data are needed. We will develop a new approach of integration of <b>seaports</b> as logistics hub in freight transport models by using key ratios. For this we will take a look at different parts and terminals of <b>seaports...</b>|$|R

5|$|Bicycle kicks first {{occurred}} in the Pacific ports of Chile and Peru. While their ships were docked, British mariners played football among themselves and with locals {{as a form of}} leisure; the sport's practice was embraced at the ports because its simple rules and equipment made it accessible to the general public. Peru's chief <b>seaport</b> of Callao, where football became a working-class sport, is possibly where the bicycle kick originates as news reports and oral traditions indicate that the local Afro-Peruvians performed the bicycle kick or tiro de chalaca ("chalaca shot", as spectators called it in reference to the local demonym) in the late 19th century, during matches with British sailors and railroad employees. Chile's important <b>seaport</b> of Talcahuano also holds a bicycle kick tradition dating to the 1910s, when Ramón Unzaga, a Basque athlete born in Spain and a naturalized Chilean, allegedly invented the manoeuvre locally known as chorera (also alluding the local demonym).|$|E

40|$|<b>Seaports</b> can be meaningfully {{analysed}} with {{a cluster}} perspective. In this perspective, <b>seaports</b> {{are regarded as}} concentrations of economic activity related to the arrival and service of ships and cargoes at ports. This perspective has two main advantages: first, it draws attention to forces of agglomeration and disagglomeration in <b>seaports.</b> Some <b>seaports</b> are able to become concentrations of logistics activities, commercial centres, ‘information hubs’ and ‘shipping hubs’, while others do not attract such activities. The cluster perspective allows for an analysis of such processes of agglomeration. Second, the cluster perspective enriches existing theories on governance in <b>seaports.</b> The analysis of governance in <b>seaports</b> has mostly been limited {{to the role of}} the port authority. Notwithstanding the central role of port authorities in ports (port clusters), we argue that a port authority is one ‘arrangement’ to improve the governance in clusters, but not the only ‘arrangement’. Other arrangements include the formation of associations, the development of public-private partnerships and the use of networks. The literature on governance in clusters provides a broad analytical framework. This framework has implications for analysing the important and complex issue of the role of port authorities in <b>seaports.</b> In this paper, we deal in depth with the issue of cluster governance in <b>seaports</b> and illustrate our approach to cluster governance with an analysis of the port of Rotterdam.

5|$|During the 9th century, the Tang <b>seaport</b> at Guangzhou {{had a large}} Muslim population. During the Song dynasty the {{importance}} of the latter <b>seaport</b> declined as the ports of Quanzhou and Fuzhou in Fujian province eclipsed it. This was followed by a decline of Middle Eastern sea merchants in China and an increasing amount of Chinese ship owners engaging in maritime trade. However, Middle Eastern merchants and other foreigners were not entirely absent, and some even gained administrative posts. For example, the Muslim Pu Shougeng—of either Persian or Arab descent—served as the Commissioner of Merchant Shipping for Quanzhou between the years 1250 and 1275. There was also the Arab astronomer Ma Yize (910–1005), who became the chief astronomer of the Song court under Taizu. Aside from these elites, Chinese seaports were filled with resident Arabs, Persians, and Koreans who had special enclaves designated for each of them.|$|E

This paper proposes a scheme to estimate the technical efficiency of Northeast Asian <b>seaports</b> as performance measure by radial and non-radial approach of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The outcome reveals that three Chinese <b>seaports</b> (Shanghai, Tianjin and Dalian) as well as three Korean <b>seaports</b> (Busan, Gwangyang, and Incheon) can be considered as efficient ones. Moreover, the paper also attemps to search for benchmark ports, and Shanghai and Busan are the identification of the benchmark <b>seaports</b> in Northeast Asia. The result of technical efficiency estimation shows that there exists a substantial opportunity for improvement in technical efficiency of <b>seaports</b> and also the heterogeneity in the technical efficiency among <b>seaports</b> in Northeast Asia...|$|R
