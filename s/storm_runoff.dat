5|$|After {{years of}} piping raw sewage {{directly}} into the waterway, Portland built its first sewage treatment plant next to the lower slough in 1952. The Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant handled a combination of raw sewage and <b>storm</b> <b>runoff</b> that flowed into the sanitary sewer system {{from all over the}} city and piped the treated water into the Columbia River. When runoff exceeded the plant's capacity during heavy rains, sewage still entered the slough from combined sewer overflows (CSO)s at 13outfalls.|$|E
5|$|Historically, most rain {{falling on}} the {{watershed}} was taken up by vegetation, flowed into wetlands, soaked into the ground, or evaporated. Heavy rain in the winter months recharged the groundwater and provided baseflows to the slough during dry summers. Urban development, which replaced vegetation and water-absorbing soils with airport runways, house roofs, highways, warehouses, parking lots, and other hard surfaces, interrupted this cycle. In 1999, a study estimated that impervious surfaces covered 54percent of the watershed. <b>Storm</b> <b>runoff</b> that might have taken days to reach the historic slough reaches the developed slough in hours.|$|E

25|$|Hell Hole Dam was {{partially}} completed {{at the time}} of extremely heavy storms in December 1964. The D/S rockfill portion was up ~220' above the river bottom, but the impervious core and adj zones were only up ~35'. Debris from extreme <b>storm</b> <b>runoff</b> U/S from the dam blocked the diversion outlet and water rapidly accumulated behind the partially constructed dam. As the water came up it was seeping thru the rockfill-and when it crested the entire mass collapsed in a matter of minutes. A surge went down the canyon-washing out 2 older suspension bridges below the Long Canyon influx and at the Spanish Dry Diggings crossing near Greenwood. It then washed out the State Highway 49 bridge over the American River just below Auburn. Folsom Dam reservoir absorbed the surge below that point.|$|E
25|$|Sewage {{may include}} {{stormwater}} runoff or urban runoff. Sewerage systems {{capable of handling}} storm water are known as combined sewer systems. This design was common when urban sewerage systems were first developed, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Combined sewers require much larger and more expensive treatment facilities than sanitary sewers. Heavy volumes of <b>storm</b> <b>runoff</b> may overwhelm the sewage treatment system, causing a spill or overflow. Sanitary sewers are typically much smaller than combined sewers, {{and they are not}} designed to transport stormwater. Backups of raw sewage can occur if excessive infiltration/inflow (dilution by stormwater and/or groundwater) is allowed into a sanitary sewer system. Communities that have urbanized in the mid-20th century or later generally have built separate systems for sewage (sanitary sewers) and stormwater, because precipitation causes widely varying flows, reducing sewage treatment plant efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Measures {{other than}} {{drainage}} {{have been implemented}} to contain flooding in the city. In 1950, dikes were built to confine <b>storm</b> <b>runoff.</b> Rivers that run through the city were encapsulated in 1950 and 1951. Rivers such as the Consulado River, Churubusco River and the Remedio River are encased in concrete tunnels which take their waters directly to the drainage system to leave the Valley. Two other rivers, the San Javier and the Tlalnepantla, which used to feed the old lake system, are diverted {{before they reach the}} city and their waters now flow directly into the Grand Canal. None of water from these rivers is allowed to sink into the ground to recharge the aquifer. While the rivers and streams that flow down from the mountain peaks still begin the way they always have, their passage through the shantytowns lacking city sanitation schemes that surround Mexico City turns them into open combined sewers. Therefore, their final stages are frequently culverted or added to the existing major culverted rivers to keep this water from contaminating the aquifer.|$|E
40|$|A physically-based {{distributed}} erosion model (MEFIDIS) {{was applied}} to evaluate the consequences of <b>storm</b> movement on <b>runoff</b> and erosion from the Alenquer basin in Portugal. Controlled soil flume laboratory experiments were also {{used to test the}} model. Nine synthetic circular storms were used, combining three storm diameters (0. 5, 1 and 2 times the Alenquer basin's axial length) with three speeds of storm movement (0. 5, 1 and 2  m/s); storm intensities were synthesized in order to maintain a constant rainfall depth of 50  mm. The model {{was applied to}} storms moving downstream as well as upstream along the basin's axis. In all tests, downstream-moving storms caused significantly higher peak runoff (56. 5 %) and net erosion (9. 1 %) than did upstream-moving storms. The consequences for peak runoff were amplified as the storm intensity increased. The hydrograph shapes were also different: for downstream-moving <b>storms,</b> <b>runoff</b> started later and the rising limb was steeper, whereas for upstream moving <b>storms,</b> <b>runoff</b> started early and the rising limb was less steep. Both laboratory and model simulations on the Alenquer basin showed that the direction of storm movement, especially in case of extreme rainfall events, significantly affected runoff and soil loss.

40|$|The risk {{of urban}} {{flooding}} is increasing {{as a result}} of rapid urbanization. Green infrastructure (GI) is an emerging planning and design concept to mitigate urban flooding.

Five scenarios, namely expanding green space, converting to concave green space, constructing a runoff retention structure, converting to porous brick pavement, and combining previous four measures were considered for an urban community in Beijing. The outcomes showed that the model performed responsively to simulate the <b>storm</b> <b>runoffs</b> at varying recurrence intervals under these scenarios. Simulation results showed that, the impervious surfaces have the most contribution to the <b>storm</b> <b>runoffs</b> of the community. The reduction capacity for single GI facility was limited, especially in bigger storm events.

40|$|Background, aim, and scope: In urban areas, <b>storm</b> water <b>runoff</b> often {{transports}} various pollutants, some {{of which}} settle and form sediments. In order to have the comprehensive view of the ecological state of <b>storm</b> water <b>runoff</b> recipients, both water and sediments of the stream must be assessed. In the Baltic Sea Area, the Water Framework Directive & HELCOM Recommendations aim to prevent or minimise pollution caused by harmful substances arising from <b>storm</b> water <b>runoff,</b> {{in order to promote}} the ecological restoration of the Baltic Sea—one of the most vulnerable seas. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the toxicity of bottom sediments of a small <b>storm</b> water <b>runoff</b> recipient focusing on the potential impact of successive discharges of urban storm water. Some <b>storm</b> water <b>runoff</b> quality parameters and the toxicity of bottom sediments of recipients was studied in this research. Materials and methods: During 9 years, at four discharge points, minimum four grab samples per year at each discharge point were taken for chemical characterisation. General parameters (pH, SS, BOD 7, CODCr and TPH) in liquid phase samples were analysed according to standard methods. Annual limit values were taken from the Lithuanian EPA requirements for the management of <b>storm</b> water <b>runoff</b> with a focus on prevention and control of contamination. Eleven composite samples of stream bottom sediments, each consisting of ten sub-samples, were collected in 2006. Toxicity screening from sediments was performed using the plant Lepidium sativum according to modified I. Magone’s methodology (Magone I, Bioindication of phytotoxicity of transport emission. In: Kachalova O-L, Zinatne (eds) Bioindication of toxicity of transport emissions in the impact of highway emissions on natural environment. Riga, pp 108 – 116, 1989).

2500|$|In 1935, the site, now planned as [...] "Flushing Meadow Park", was {{selected}} for {{what would become the}} 1939 World's Fair. In addition to the ash dumps and undeveloped meadows, houses in Corona east of 111th Street, adjacent to the dumps, were condemned and added to the site, displacing residents. The plans were drafted by Parks Department landscape architect Gilmore David Clarke and his partner Michael Rapuano, designed in Beaux-Arts style. Work on the World's Fair site began on June 16, 1936. The project primarily involved leveling the ash mounds, with the leftover material used to fill other areas of the meadow. Two sites were excavated to create Meadow and Willow Lake, while much of the Flushing River was diverted into underground culverts. A floodgate was built to prevent tidal flow from flooding the lakes. In addition to recreation, the lakes would serve as repositories for excess <b>storm</b> <b>runoff.</b> The dirt from the lake sites was used as additional topsoil for the park. The project was a 24-hour-a-day job, with 450 workers operating on three daily shifts. Workers had to combat the effects of high tide, and dust storms created by the ash.
