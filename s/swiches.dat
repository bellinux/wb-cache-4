40|$|Low-overhead {{checkpointing}} and rollback is {{a popular}} technique for fault recovery. While different approaches are possible, hardware-supported checkpointing and rollback at the cache level is especially interesting. The main {{reason is that the}} microarchitecture required can be easily integrated and used effectively in modern processor microarchitectures. Unfortunately, proposed cache-level checkpointing schemes provide little implementation information and do not support a large rollback window all the time. In this paper, we outline the design of <b>SWICH,</b> a new cache-level checkpointing scheme that, while being efficiently implemented in modern processors, supports a large rollback window continuously. This is accomplished by relying on two live checkpoints at all times to form a sliding rollback window. We build an FPGA-based prototype of <b>SWICH.</b> The evaluation of the prototype shows that a simple processor can support the sliding window with little additional logic and memory hardware. Moreover, for applications without frequent I/O or system calls, the technique sustains large minimum and average rollback windows...|$|R

40|$|The {{kinetics}} and {{the reaction}} patterns of the HO 3 + and H 2 O 3 + ions toward a variety of inorganic and organic substrates have been investigated by using Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) spectrometry. The thermochemistry of the HO 3 + and H 2 O 3 + ions is evaluated from correlations between their proton transfer (PT) efficiencies and the proton affinity (PA) of the selected substrates. Similarly, thermochemical data on HO 3 and H 2 O 3 species are inferred from a comparison between the electron transfer (PT) efficiencies of their cationic counterparts and the standard ionization energies (IE) of the substrates. Thus, in striking contrast with most literature theoretical and empirical estimates, an experimental value of - 1 +/- 5 kcal mol(- 1) is obtained for the standard heat of formation of HO 3. Accordingly, ground-state HO 3 ((2) A) is thermochemically stable toward dissociation to HO((2) Pi) and O- 2 ((3) Sigma(g) (-)), and therefore, its existence as a true intermediate in key ionic reactions occurring in the upper atmosphere cannot be excluded. The standard formation enthalpy of H 2 O 3 + (198 +/- 5 kcal mol(- 1)) is evaluated by two independent approaches, while that of the HOOOH neutral molecule is estimated as {{less than or equal}} to- 26 kcal mol(- 1). The HO 3 + ion displays a variegated chemistry. Depending {{of the nature of the}} reactive centers of the neutral substrate, the HO 3 + ion may react as a Bronsted or a Lewis acid, as an oxenium ion or an oxygen-centered free radical.

Control of poliomyelitis in Indonesia has been commenced since 1982 with routine immunization of polio program and the National Immunization Days (NID) has been commenced since 1995, 1996, 2005 and 2006. When the world is free from polio virus, WHO suggests several alternative effort to maintain the world free from polio viruses : I) stop the OPV (Oral Polio Vaccine) and no polio immunization, 2) stop OPV and stock pile mOPV (monovalent OPV), 3) use OPV and IPV (Inactivated Polio Vaccine) in a certain times, 4) use IPV only in a certain times. IPV has been used routinely in develop countries but has not been used in the developing countries. Several studies in development countries has been conducted, but had not been done in the developing countries. Indonesia collaboration with WHO has conducted the study of IPV in Yogyakarta Province since year 2002 until year 2010.

Methods: Multicenter retrospective study of four tertiary hospitals in Spain. The analysis includes 147 patients switching to DRV/r mx mainly due to toxicity or simplification from March 2009 to June 2011. The Spanish costs (ex-factory price+VAT) per patient with HIV RNA&# 60; 50 copies/ml were calculated, accounting for additional/ switch antiretroviral taken after initial treatment failure and management of adverse events. Cost of adverse events were based on a Spanish publication [1] (updated by the inflation rate until april 2012) The horizon of the analysis was of 48 weeks. Summary of results: Baseline characteristics were: women (30. 6 %), median age (49 yr), IDU (45 %), AIDS stage (32 %), HCV coinfected (48 %, 40 % with advanced fibrosis), length of HIV-RNA&# 60; 1. 7 before DRV/rtv mtx 67. 6. Most frequent reasons for switching to DRVr mx were toxicity (62. 6 %) and simplification (23. 8 %). If a hospital with 600 patients in ART treatment, switched from 10 % to 20 % of its patients to DRV/r mx, there is a potential to save up to 448, 000 &#x 20 AC;/year.

40|$|Introduction. Endocarditis is {{the most}} common {{cardiovascular}} manifestation of brucellosis with high mortality rate. Brucella is less accesable to antibiotic (but not for all) and relapse can occur after a various period of clinical latency. Case report. A 55 -year-old farmer was diagnozed with acute systemic Brucella infection in May 2008 and treated with antibiotic therapy in regional hospital for two months and for three months after discharge. He began to feel myalgia, arthralgia, malaise, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea and lost weight eight months after initial symptoms occured. Because symptoms progressed he was admitted to our hospital in February 2009. Based on a combination of epidemiological, clinical data (on admission he was catchetic, adynamic, dyspneic, hypotensive 80 / 50 mmHg, fever up to 39. 50 C), positive serological Wright test for brucellosis (1 : 5, 120), and echocardiographic examination findings, the diagnosis of very severe relapse of brucellosis with mitral valve endocarditis, complicated with perforation of anterior mitral leaflet, severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension was established. He was treated with a combined triple antibiotic therapy (vancomycin, ciprofloxacin and gentamicin, and <b>swiched</b> to regimen with doxycycline, gentamicin and imipenem, replacing gentamicin by rifampicin) for 4 weeks and for the next 2 weeks was receiving trimetoprime/sulfamethoxazole and rifampicin.

It differs in significant details, resulting in a circulating but unequal temperament using [...] Pythagorean-comma fifths that is effective through all 24 keys and, most important, tunable by ear without an electronic tuning device. It {{is based on the}} synchronicity between the fifth F-C and the third F-A (c. 3 beats per second) and between the fifth C-G and the third C-E (c. 2 beats per second). Such a system is reminiscent of Herbert Anton Kellner's 1977 temperament and even more, among the others, the temperament of the 1688 Arp Schnitger organ in Norden, St Ludgeri and the temperament later described by Carlo Gervasoni in his La scuola della musica (Piacenza, 1800). Such a system with all its major thirds more or less sharp is confirmed by Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg's report about the way a famous student of Bach's, Johann Philipp Kirnberger, was taught to tune in his lessons with Bach. It allows all 24 keys to be played through without changing tuning nor unpleasant intervals, but with varying degrees of difference-the temperament being unequal, and the keys not all sounding the same. Compared to Werckmeister III, the other 24 keys-circulating temperament, Bach's tuning is much more differentiated with its 8 (instead of Werckmeister's 4) different kinds of major thirds. The manuscript Bach P415 in Berlin Staatsbibliothek is the only known copy of the WTC to show this drawing which represents, a bit cryptically in Bach's spirit, the purpose for which the masterpiece was written and its solution at the same time. Not surprisingly, since this is most probably the working copy that Johann Sebastian Bach used in his classes.|$|R
