25|$|Each train {{consists}} of a locomotive pushing a single passenger car up the mountain, descending the mountain by going backwards. Both locomotive and car were originally equipped with a ratchet and pawl mechanism engaged during the climb that prevents any roll-back; during descent, both locomotive and car are braked. Recent improvements in design have replaced the ratchet (gear and pawl mechanism) with <b>sprag</b> clutches and disc brake assemblies. Most of the locomotives {{were made by the}} Manchester Locomotive Works.|$|E
25|$|The first models, known generically as the T300s, {{all used}} a common piston {{diameter}} (76mm) {{in a common}} wet cylinder liner. Basic engine variations were achieved {{through the use of}} two specifications of piston stroke: 65mm to create individual cylinder capacity of 300cc, and 55mm to create a 250cc individual cylinder. Two 750cc models were released – and the Daytona and Trident 750 triples (3 x 250cc). There was one 1000cc model – the Daytona 1000 four (4 x 250cc). Two 900cc models were the Trophy 900 and Trident 900 triples (3 x 300cc). The Trophy 1200 four was the largest model (4 x 300cc). All were remarkably smooth running. The three cylinder models were equipped with a contra-rotating balance shaft mounted {{at the front of the}} engine. The four cylinder models benefitted from twin balance shafts – unique at the time – mounted beneath the crank shaft. Contemporary road tests noted the solidity and smoothness of performance as positives but the weight of the machines as negatives. For brand new machines produced by a totally new concern, there were remarkably few early problems. These were an insecure oil pressure switch and a longer-lived problem with the starter (or <b>sprag</b> clutch). The cosmetic finish on the first machines was simple and not very robust. Revisions to crankcases for the three-cylinder models in 1993, together with a move to high pressure casting, reduced engine weight considerably. All painting and plating operations were brought in house in 1993, as the Hinckley factory benefitted from further investment after the initial success of the range. The result was improved quality and durability of finish, added to the basic engineering integrity of the engine and chassis, made for a long-lasting and robust motorcycle.|$|E
60|$|As to Shakespeare's education, Judge Webb {{admits that}} 'there was a grammar {{school in the}} place.' As its {{registers}} of pupils have not survived, we cannot prove that Shakespeare went to the school. Mr. Collins shows that the Headmaster was a Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and describes {{the nature of the}} education, mainly in Latin, as, according to the standard of the period, it ought to have been.* There is no doubt that if Shakespeare attended the school (the age of entry was eight), minded his book, and had 'a good <b>sprag</b> memory,' he might have learned Latin. Mr. Collins commends the Latin of two Stratford contemporaries and friends of Shakespeare, Sturley and Quiney, who probably were educated at the Grammar School. Judge Webb disparages their lore, and, on the evidence of the epistles, says that Sturley and Quiney 'were not men of education.' If Judge Webb had compared the original letters of distinguished Elizabethan officials and diplomatists--say, Sir William Drury, the Commandant of Berwick--he would have found that Sturley and Quiney were at least on the ordinary level of education in the upper classes. But the whole method of the Baconians rests on neglecting such comparisons.|$|E

50|$|Many modern {{sport and}} racing bikes use <b>sprag</b> {{clutches}} {{in the primary}} drive between the engine and transmission. This prevents the rear wheel from losing traction during rapid downshifts when the engine speed is not matched to road speed. If a <b>sprag</b> clutch is not present, much greater care is required when downshifting, because losing rear wheel traction can cause dangerous highside accidents.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>sprag</b> clutch {{is used in}} most older {{automatic}} transmissions and some newer ones for shifts which require the synchronized engagement of one clutch with the disengagement of another.

40|$|The {{advantages}} {{to be gained}} from braking have not been ignored, and in the search for a suitable method many schemes have been suggested and tried. Some of the methods discussed in this paper include: 1) increasing the height of the landing gear; 2) air brakes of various forms; 3) <b>sprags</b> on tail skid and axle; and 4) wheel brakes. This report focuses on the design of wheel brakes and wheel brake controls...|$|R
50|$|Recovering {{the vehicle}} took longer and {{required}} an A-frame {{to be put}} up {{and a series of}} manoeuvres to refold the ramps. The <b>sprags</b> were repositioned manually with a special tool. The projected ramp landed on concertina shock absorbers that were liable to be crushed if the ramp landed on anything other than soft ground; damaged shock absorbers had to be replaced. Spare rockets were held in a magazine {{at the rear of the}} vehicle.|$|R
50|$|The 4T65-E was {{introduced}} to replace the 4T60-E in 1997. The 4T65-E included a larger 258 mm torque converter for some models and many other changes to improve reliability. It is able to handle vehicles up to 6500 lb (2948 kg) GVWR with up to 280 ft·lbf (380 N·m) of torque. A number of final drive ratios are available, with many distinct models. Starting in mid year 2000 models, all 4T65-E models received an upgraded valve body. Starting in 2003 the internal electronics were changed, hardened 4th gear shaft, ratcheting <b>sprags</b> for input and third gear were added. The last application was the 2011 Chevrolet Impala as GM has transitioned to the 6T70 family transmissions for 2012.|$|R
50|$|One-way <b>sprag</b> {{clutches}} {{have also}} been used for the same purpose, but are generally not adjustable for disengagement force. Early Honda Shadow models used a design wherein a <b>sprag</b> clutch is connected to just half of the clutch friction plates, allowing the clutch to slip during heavy backloading sufficiently to prevent rear-wheel lockup, while still allowing moderate engine compression braking with the remaining friction plates.|$|E

50|$|For a goods (freight) {{train in}} a similar situation, the wheels would have been 'scotched' against roll-back, and guard's vans on goods trains carried 'sprags' with which to do this. Those on {{passenger}} trains with continuous brakes {{were not required to}} carry <b>sprags,</b> and the excursion train did not. The guard in the rear van having applied his handbrake then (on the instructions of the chief clerk) dismounted and scotched the wheels of his van with pieces of ballast. He then also scotched the near rearmost vehicle on its righthand wheels and intended to similarly scotch its lefthand wheels before going back down the track with flags and detonators to protect the train from the scheduled service which was to set off from Armagh 20 minutes after the excursion.|$|R
50|$|Internally, the {{underground}} hospital was timbered like a mine, although two different techniques were used. The north tunnel was heavily timbered with three piece sets of sawn Oregon posts and top lagged with hardwood planks {{resting on the}} caps. Five sets were intact in October 1997. The rest of the hospital was lightly timbered with round logs of native hardwood about 1.5 cm in diameter. Throughout most of the hospital only occasional posts were standing in 1997 {{and most of these}} were dislodged and leaning. A few intact set survived in the north east corner, showing the construction was generally similar to the sawn timber Oregon sets; having round caps and hardwood plank lagging resting on them. The sets were spaced by <b>sprags</b> resting on cleats nailed to the tops of the posts.|$|R
5000|$|In a Simpson gearset, {{common to}} many automatics, this {{happens on the}} 1-2 shift, and reverses on the 2-1 downshift. The 2-3 shift is done by {{engaging}} a single clutch, and nothing is released. Some newer electronically controlled transmissions make [...] "clutch to clutch" [...] shifts, without any <b>sprags.</b> This {{can also be used}} exclusively in first gear (transmission shift lever in D, but auto valve body or management selecting 1st) on some autos. That way it will automatically provide forward drive, but will not provide any engine braking. This is done not so much to avoid engine braking per se, but rather to allow a low throttle opening 2-1 downshift as a car decelerates, to avoid a loud (and potentially abrupt) and unnerving jolt {{as a result of the}} downshift. On transmissions so equipped, manual selection of 1st gear typically engages an additional band that grips the same section as the one way clutch would engage, and thus allows for engine braking.|$|R

5000|$|To effect gear changes, one of {{two types}} of {{clutches}} or bands are used to hold a particular member of the planetary gearset motionless, while allowing another member to rotate, thereby transmitting torque and producing gear reductions or overdrive ratios. These clutches are actuated by the valve body (see below), their sequence controlled by the transmission's internal programming. Principally, a type of device known as a <b>sprag</b> or roller clutch is used for routine upshifts/downshifts. Operating much as a ratchet, it transmits torque only in one direction, free-wheeling or [...] "overrunning" [...] in the other. The advantage {{of this type of}} clutch is that it eliminates the sensitivity of timing a simultaneous clutch release/apply on two planetaries, simply [...] "taking up" [...] the drivetrain load when actuated, and releasing automatically when the next gear's <b>sprag</b> clutch assumes the torque transfer. The bands come into play for manually selected gears, such as low range or reverse, and operate on the planetary drum's circumference. Bands are not applied when drive/overdrive range is selected, the torque being transmitted by the <b>sprag</b> clutches instead. Bands are used for braking; the GM Turbo-Hydramatics incorporated this..|$|E
50|$|When the Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton Railway {{was first}} opened, traffic along it mostly {{consisted}} of traffic going between Hazleton and Wilkes-Barre, although occasionally passengers got on at intermediate points. However, after the railroad was constructed, {{and due to}} its construction, some businesses began operation near the Pine View Ice Lakes along the route. The railroad also improved business for farmers near the community of Albert, {{who were able to}} send their milk to creameries in Hazleton. It also provided electricity for communities along the route. Additionally it transported materials for the mining industry, such as timber props, wedges, and <b>sprags</b> to Nuangola. The Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton Railway provided an easy way for hunters, fishermen, and sportsmen to access the mountainous countryside between Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton. Common places that such people frequented along the route included Nuangola Lake, Pine View Lake, and Lake Blytheburn. These areas gradually developed into villages. chickens were once exported from the railroad's Nuangola station. Another use of the railway was to carry passengers from Hazleton to the Luzerne County Courthouse.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the analysis and}} measurement of the dynamic center of pressure of a brake pad during a normal braking event. The technique is unique in its design and implementation. The process is progressive whereby the interface static measurements are first taken and then dynamic testing is carried out under braking. Two different measurement systems are considered during the analysis with one {{used to measure the}} center of pressure. Both the in-board and out-board pads are measured for wear but the piston pad was selected for pressure measurements. Validation of the <b>spragging</b> process is undertaken on both test rigs and vehicle trials. Pad wear measurements complement the collective information. The results show the position of the center of pressure to vary considerably during a braking event, both radially and axially along the pad. The variable "instability envelope" is related to the caliper-mounting geometry which is subsequently compared to the effective "spragging angle" and the generation of brake noise. It is seen that by careful selection of the backplate abutment friction level the center of pressure may be controlled to always fall within the "stable envelope" region...|$|R
50|$|The May 1915 'Appendix' to the Caledonian Railway Working Timetable {{states of}} the Lylestone Siding that - This Siding will be worked by Up Trains only. It is {{controlled}} by a Staff Key which is kept {{in charge of the}} Signalman at Lissens Siding. When a train which is to work Lylestone Siding arrives at Lissens, it must be stopped at the signal Box, when the Engine will be detached, and the Brakesman in charge will see that the Train is secured by the Van Brake being hard on, and the Front wagons held by <b>Sprags</b> in their wheels. The Brakesman in charge will then get the Staff Key from the signalman, and go forward to Lylestone Siding with the Engine and any Wagons there may be for the Siding, and he will work the points as required. After the work is finished, and Sidings points properly set for the Main Line, the Engine will propel the Wagons taken from Lylestone Siding on the Up Line to Lissens, where they will be run into the Siding by gravitation. The Brakesman will return with the engine to Lissens, and will hand the Staff key back to the Signalman, after which the ordinary working will resume.|$|R
