25|$|The {{aggressive}} spillover hypothesis {{suggests that}} the more aggressive a female is concerning prey, the more likely the female is to cannibalize a potential mate. The decision of a female to cannibalize a male is not defined by the nutritional value or genetic advantage (courtship dances, male aggressiveness, & large body size) of males but instead depends strictly on her aggressive state. Aggression of the female is measured by latency (<b>speed)</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> on prey. The faster the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> and consumption of prey, the higher the aggressiveness level. Females displaying aggressive characteristics tend to grow larger than other females and display continuous cannibalistic behavior. Such behavior may drive away potential mates, reducing chances of mating. Aggressive behavior is less common {{in an environment that}} is female-biased, because there is more competition to mate with a male. In these female dominated environments, such aggressive behavior comes with the risk of scaring away potential mates.|$|E

50|$|The first {{successful}} homing torpedo {{was introduced by}} Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine for use by its U-boat arm against Allied shipping. After capturing several of these weapons, along with independent research, the United States introduced the FIDO air-dropped homing torpedo (also called the Mark 24 'mine' as a cover) in 1943. FIDO was designed to breach the steel pressure hull of a submarine but not necessarily cause a catastrophic implosion, forcing the now-crippled submarine to surface where the submarine and crew might possibly be captured. After World War II, homing torpedoes {{became one of the}} primary anti-submarine weapons, used by most of the world's naval powers. Aircraft continued to be a primary launching platform, including the newly available helicopter, though homing torpedoes can also be launched from surface ships or submarines. However, the torpedo's inherent limitations in <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> and detection by the target have {{led to the development of}} missile-borne anti-submarine weapons that can be delivered practically on top of the enemy submarine, such as ASROC.|$|E
50|$|The major {{advantages}} of anti-submarine missiles are range and <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b> Torpedoes {{are not very}} fast compared to a missile, nor as long-ranged, and are much easier for a submarine to detect. Anti-sub missiles are usually delivered from surface vessels, offering the surface escort an all-weather, all-sea-conditions instant readiness weapon to attack time-urgent targets that no other delivery system can match for speed of response. They have the added advantage that they are under the direct control of the escort vessel's commander, and unlike air-delivered weapons cannot be diverted to other taskings, or be dependent on weather or maintenance availability. Aircraft delivery can be further compromised by low fuel state or an expended weapon load. The missile is always available, and at instant readiness. It allows the torpedo or nuclear depth bomb to enter the water practically {{on top of the}} submarine's position, minimizing the submarine's ability to detect and evade the attack. Missiles are also more rapid and accurate in many cases than helicopters or aircraft for dropping torpedoes and depth charges, with a typical interval of 1 to 1.5 minutes from a launch decision to torpedo splashdown. Helicopters frequently take much longer to just get off the escort's deck.|$|E

50|$|Ballistic foam {{is a type}} of {{polyurethane}} foam placed in the dry bays of aircraft. Ballistic foam prevents fires, adds strength to the structure, slows down the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> shrapnel during <b>attacks,</b> and offers cost-effective protection.|$|R
50|$|As <b>speed</b> reduces, angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> has to {{increase}} to keep lift constant until the critical angle is reached.

Pétain had 40-62 mutineers shot as examples and introduced reforms to improve the welfare of French troops, which had a significant effect in restoring morale.

40|$|A {{community}} network often operates {{with the same}} Internet service provider domain or the virtual network of different entities who are cooperating with each other. In such a federated network environment, routers can work closely to raise early warning of DDoS attacks to void catastrophic damages. However, the attackers simulate the normal network behaviors, e. g. pumping the attack packages as poisson distribution, to disable detection algorithms. It is an open question: how to discriminate DDoS attacks from surge legitimate accessing. We noticed that the attackers use the same mathematical functions to control the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> package pumping to the victim. Based on this observation, the different attack flows of a DDoS attack share the same regularities, which {{is different from the}} real surging accessing in a short time period.

We present a general set of metrics for proxy network topologies which can be applied to evaluate them with respect to robustness and vulnerability. We apply these metrics and analysis to a range of popular overlay network topologies, showing that the Chord [18] used for location-hiding in [27, 19], is not a good choice, and that topologies such as CAN [20] are a much better topology for DoS resistance and location-hiding. In general proxy networks with lower vertex degrees and balanced distribution of connectivity have better properties. Our results provide a set of sound design principles for proxy network topologies for location-hiding and DoS-resistance...|$|E
40|$|Variation {{in modern}} crocodilian and extinct thalattosuchian crocodylomorph skull {{morphology}} is only weakly correlated with phylogeny, implying that {{factors other than}} evolutionary proximity play important roles in determining crocodile skull shape. To further explore factors potentially influencing morphological differentiation within the Thalattosuchia, we examine teleosaurid and metriorhynchid skull shape variation within a mechanical and dietary context {{using a combination of}} finite element modelling and multivariate statistics. Patterns of stress distribution through the skull were found to be very similar in teleosaurid and metriorhynchid species, with stress peaking at the posterior constriction of the snout and around the enlarged supratemporal fenestrae. However, the magnitudes of stresses differ, with metriorhynchids having generally stronger skulls. As with modern crocodilians, a strong linear relationship between skull length and skull strength exists, with short-snouted morphotypes experiencing less stress through the skull than long-snouted morphotypes under equivalent loads. Selection on snout shape related to dietary preference was found to work in orthogonal directions in the two families: diet is associated with snout length in teleosaurids and with snout width in metriorhynchids, suggesting that teleosaurid skulls were adapted for <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> and metriorhynchid skulls for force production. Evidence also indicates that morphological and functional differentiation of the skull occurred as a result of dietary preference, allowing closely related sympatric species to exploit a limited environment. Comparisons of the mechanical performance of the thalattosuchian skull with extant crocodilians show that teleosaurids and long-snouted metriorhynchids exhibit stress magnitudes similar to or greater than those of long-snouted modern forms, whereas short-snouted metriorhynchids display stress magnitudes converging on those found in short-snouted modern species. As a result, teleosaurids and long-snouted metriorhynchids were probably restricted to lateral attacks of the head and neck, but short-snouted metriorhynchids may have been able to employ the grasp and shake and/or ‘death roll’ feeding and foraging behaviours...|$|E
