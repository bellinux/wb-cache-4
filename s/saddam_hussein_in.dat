25|$|Ignatieff's interventionist {{approach}} led him {{to support}} the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. According to Ignatieff, the United States had a duty to expend itself unseating Iraqi president <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>in</b> the interests of international security and human rights. Ignatieff initially accepted the argument of George W. Bush administration that containment through sanctions and threats would not prevent Hussein from selling {{weapons of mass destruction}} to international terrorists. Ignatieff wrongly believed that those weapons were still being developed in Iraq.|$|E

Sharif's government criticised Iraq for invading the fellow Muslim country, which strained Pakistan's relationships with Iraq.

25|$|In the 1980s, Saudi Arabia spent $25 {{billion in}} support of <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>in</b> the Iran–Iraq War. However, Saudi Arabia {{condemned}} the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and asked the US to intervene. King Fahd allowed American and coalition troops to be stationed in Saudi Arabia. He invited the Kuwaiti government {{and many of its}} citizens to stay in Saudi Arabia, but expelled citizens of Yemen and Jordan because of their governments' support of Iraq. In 1991, Saudi Arabian forces were involved both in bombing raids on Iraq and in the land invasion that helped to liberate Kuwait.|$|E

She was elected to the Italian parliament in 1987, with approximately 20,000 votes.

25|$|The Quds Force {{was created}} during the Iran–Iraq War {{as a special}} unit from the broader IRGC forces. Both {{during and after the}} war, it {{provided}} support to the Kurds fighting <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein.</b> <b>In</b> 1982, a Quds unit was deployed to Lebanon, where it assisted in the genesis of Hezbollah. The Force also expanded its operations into neighboring Afghanistan, most notably aiding Abdul Ali Mazari's Shi'a Hezbe Wahdat in the 1980s against the government of Mohammad Najibullah. It then began funding and supporting Ahmad Shah Massoud's Northern Alliance against the Taliban. However, in recent years, the Quds Force {{is believed to have been}} helping and guiding the Taliban insurgents against the NATO-backed Karzai administration. There were also reports of the unit lending support to Bosnian Muslims fighting the Bosnian Serbs during the Yugoslav wars.|$|E
25|$|During the Iraq War, Staff Sergeant Popaditch was {{assigned}} as a tank commander and platoon sergeant. Participating in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, his unit gained fame when it helped topple {{the statue of}} <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>in</b> Firdos Square on April 9, 2003. Associated Press photographer Laurent Rebours photographed Popaditch in his tank’s cupola, smoking a cigar with the statue of Saddam looming in the background. The image, which earned him the nickname “The Cigar Marine,” appeared {{on the front pages}} of newspapers around the world to describe the Battle of Baghdad. He would later reveal that his smoking was a celebration of his and his wife's twelfth wedding anniversary as well as victory. Following his return to the United States, he was promoted to gunnery sergeant and volunteered to return to Iraq in 2004.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, Staller {{was among}} the founders of another Italian {{political}} movement, called Partito dell'Amore ("Party of Love"), which was spearheaded by friend and fellow porn star Moana Pozzi. In January 2002, she began exploring the possibility of campaigning in Hungary, her country of birth, to represent Budapest's industrial Kőbánya district in the Hungarian parliament. However, she failed to collect enough petition signatures for a non-partisan candidacy. In the same year, she ran in local elections in Monza, Italy, promising to convert a prominent building into a gambling casino, but she attracted few votes. In 2004, she announced plans {{to run for mayor}} of Milan with a similar promise. She renewed her offer to have sex with <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>in</b> October 2002, when Iraq was resisting international pressure to allow inspections for weapons of mass destruction, and in April 2006, she made the same offer to Osama bin Laden.|$|E

25|$|The next day, another brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division {{attacked}} into downtown Baghdad {{and occupied}} {{one of the}} palaces of <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>in</b> fierce fighting. U.S. Marines also faced heavy shelling from Iraqi artillery as they attempted to cross a river bridge, but the river crossing was successful. The Iraqis managed to inflict some casualties on the U.S. forces near the airport from defensive positions but suffered severe casualties from air bombardment. Within hours of the palace seizure and with television coverage of this spreading through Iraq, U.S. forces ordered Iraqi forces within Baghdad to surrender, or the city would face a full-scale assault. Iraqi government officials had either disappeared or had conceded defeat, and on 9 April 2003, Baghdad was formally occupied by Coalition forces. Much of Baghdad remained unsecured however, and fighting continued within {{the city and its}} outskirts well into the period of occupation. Saddam had vanished, and his whereabouts were unknown.|$|E

In April 1994, Zardari denied allegations that he was wielding unregulated influence as a spouse and acting as [...] "de-facto Prime Minister".

500|$|From the 1980s to the 1990s, the party's policy {{shifted from}} favouring the European Union to turning against it. In 2002, Jean-Marie Le Pen campaigned on pulling France {{out of the}} EU and re-introducing the franc as {{national}} currency. In the early 2000s the party denounced the Schengen, Maastricht, and Amsterdam treaties as foundations for [...] "a supranational entity spelling the end of France." [...] In 2004, the party criticised the EU as [...] "the last stage {{on the road to}} world government", likening it to a [...] "puppet of the New World Order." [...] It also proposed breaking all institutional ties back to the Treaty of Rome, while it returned to supporting a common European currency to rival the United States dollar. Further, it rejected the possible accession of Turkey to the EU. The FN was also one of several parties that backed France's 2005 rejection of the Treaty for a European Constitution. In other issues, Le Pen opposed the invasions of Iraq, led by the United States, both in the 1991 Gulf War and the 2003 Iraq War. He visited <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>in</b> Baghdad in 1990, and subsequently considered him a friend.|$|E
500|$|Parker and Stone {{state that}} {{subjecting}} {{themselves to a}} one-week deadline creates more spontaneity amongst themselves in the creative process, which they feel results in a funnier show. The schedule also allows South Park to both stay more topical and respond more quickly to specific current events than other satiric animated shows. One of the earliest examples of {{this was in the}} season four (2000) episode [...] "Quintuplets 2000", which references the United States Border Patrol's raid of a house during the Elián González affair, an event which occurred only four days before the episode originally aired. The season nine (2005) episode [...] "Best Friends Forever" [...] references the Terri Schiavo case, and originally aired {{in the midst of the}} controversy and less than 12 hours before she died. A scene in the season seven (2003) finale [...] "It's Christmas in Canada" [...] references the discovery of dictator <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>in</b> a [...] "spider hole" [...] and his subsequent capture, which happened a mere three days prior to the episode airing. The season 12 (2008) episode [...] "About Last Night..." [...] revolves around Barack Obama's victory in the 2008 presidential election, and aired less than 24 hours after Obama was declared the winner, using segments of dialogue from Obama's real victory speech.|$|E
