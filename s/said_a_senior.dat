[...] "The invitation was an inducement to get them back into the international fold," [...] <b>said</b> <b>a</b> <b>senior</b> US official, speaking anonymously because of the sensitive issues. [...] "But the Pakistanis couldn't get their own act together" [...] in time for the summit. [...] "The main issue, it seems, is money." ...|$|E

2500|$|Clinton Administration {{officials}} told the New York Times that US support for Suharto was [...] "driven by a potent mix of power politics and emerging markets."

2500|$|The George W. Bush {{administration}} also voiced {{support for an}} adaptation-only policy in the US in 2002. [...] "In a stark shift for the Bush administration, the United States has sent a climate report [...] to the United Nations detailing specific and far-reaching effects it says global warming will inflict on the American environment. In the report, the {{administration also}} {{for the first time}} places most of the blame for recent global warming on human actions—mainly the burning of fossil fuels that send heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere." [...] The report however [...] "does not propose any major shift in the administration's policy on greenhouse gases. Instead it recommends adapting to inevitable changes instead of making rapid and drastic reductions in greenhouse gases to limit warming." [...] This position apparently precipitated a similar shift in emphasis at the COP 8 climate talks in New Delhi several months later, [...] "The shift satisfies the Bush administration, which has fought to avoid mandatory cuts in emissions for fear it would harm the economy.

Secretary of State John Kerry phoned Netanyahu to clarify that [...] "such statements are disgraceful, unacceptable and damaging" [...] and [...] "do not reflect the position of the United States." [...] Netanyahu responded by saying [...] "I'm being attacked because of my determination to defend Israel's interests. The safety of Israel is not important to those who attack me anonymously and personally." [...] Because of evident rifts between Netanyahu and members of the Obama administration, observers have characterized the relationship as having reached a crisis level by October 2014. The relationship between Netanyahu and the Obama administration had become problematic enough that Jeffrey Goldberg reported in November 2014 that his conversations with Netanyahu and other Israeli officials indicated Israel would wait until a new U.S. president is elected before attempting to repair the relationship with the White House. According to Alon Pinkas, a former diplomat and adviser to Israeli prime ministers, “Netanyahu’s self-righteousness that this resolution is going to be changed or reversed by Trump is totally unfounded." ...|$|E
