5|$|Meanwhile, Buzz and {{the other}} toys reach Al's Toy Barn. While searching for Woody, Buzz is imprisoned by a new Buzz Lightyear toy, who {{believes}} Buzz is a rogue space ranger. The new Buzz joins the other toys, who mistake him for Andy's Buzz. After revealing Al's plan, they go to his apartment, while Andy's Buzz escapes and pursues them, accidentally freeing an Emperor Zurg toy, who in turn follows him {{with the intent of}} destroying him. After the toys find Woody, Buzz rejoins them, and proves that he is Andy's Buzz, but Woody refuses to go home. Buzz reminds Woody that a toy's true purpose is to be played with, which he would never experience in a museum. After seeing a boy play with him on TV, Woody realizes Buzz was right, and asks the Roundup gang to come home with him and Andy's toys. However, Stinky Pete declines, and traps the gang, revealing that he wants to go to the museum to be appreciated forever, having never been sold or played with. He was also the one responsible for foiling Woody's earlier escape attempt and framing Jessie for it. Al then returns, takes the gang in a <b>suitcase,</b> <b>and</b> leaves for the airport.|$|E

He returned to England in the mid-1930s only to depart again after receiving a three-year contract to teach at Peking University. Upon his arrival he discovered that, because of the Japanese invasion of China, he no longer had a post. He joined the exodus of the university's staff, with little more than a typewriter and a <b>suitcase,</b> <b>and</b> ended up in Kunming, with Lianda (Southwest Associated University), the school created there by students and professors who were refugees from the war in the North. He arrived back in England in January 1939.|$|E

25|$|On 18 February 1943, the Scholls {{brought a}} {{suitcase}} full of leaflets {{to the university}} main building. They hurriedly dropped stacks of copies in the empty corridors for students to find {{when they left the}} lecture rooms. Leaving before the lectures had ended, the Scholls noticed that there were some left-over copies in the <b>suitcase</b> <b>and</b> decided to distribute them. Sophie flung the last remaining leaflets from the top floor down into the atrium. This spontaneous action was observed by the university maintenance man, Jakob Schmied. Hans and Sophie Scholl were taken into Gestapo custody. A draft of a seventh pamphlet, written by Christoph Probst, was found in the possession of Hans Scholl {{at the time of his}} arrest by the Gestapo. While Sophie Scholl got rid of incriminating evidence before being taken into custody, Hans did try to destroy the draft of the last leaflet by tearing it apart and trying to swallow it down. However, the Gestapo recovered enough of it and were able to match the handwriting with other writings from Probst, which they found when they searched Hans's apartment.|$|E
25|$|As an example, {{consider}} {{determining whether}} a suitcase contains some radioactive material. Placed under a Geiger counter, it produces 10 counts per minute. The null hypothesis is that no radioactive material is in the <b>suitcase</b> <b>and</b> that all measured counts are due to ambient radioactivity typical of the surrounding air and harmless objects. We can then calculate how {{likely it is that}} we would observe 10 counts per minute if the null hypothesis were true. If the null hypothesis predicts (say) on average 9 counts per minute, then according to the Poisson distribution typical for radioactive decay there is about 41% chance of recording 10 or more counts. Thus we can say that the suitcase is compatible with the null hypothesis (this does not guarantee that there is no radioactive material, just that we don't have enough evidence to suggest there is). On the other hand, if the null hypothesis predicts 3 counts per minute (for which the Poisson distribution predicts only 0.1% chance of recording 10 or more counts) then the suitcase is not compatible with the null hypothesis, and there are likely other factors responsible to produce the measurements.|$|E

500|$|The group {{followed}} Monterey with a US tour supporting Herman's Hermits. The Hermits were {{a straightforward}} pop band and enjoyed drugs and practical jokes.

Moon recalled his first attempt to flush one down the toilet: [...] "ll that porcelain flying through the air was quite unforgettable. I never realised dynamite was so powerful." [...] After a gig in Flint, Michigan on Moon's 21st birthday on 23 August 1967, the entourage caused $24,000 of damage at the hotel, and Moon knocked out one of his front teeth.
