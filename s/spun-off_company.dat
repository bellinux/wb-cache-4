40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{shareholder}} wealth created through spinoff restructuring at Oslo Stock Exchange, {{over the period}} 1991 - 2010. By using a proxy for the transaction announcement, I find no support for an abnormal return in this period except for small fraction spinoffs. However, significant positive abnormal returns over a period reaching from 231 trading days before the spinoff until {{the first day of}} separate trading for the divested firms, is documented for cross-industry transactions, small fraction transactions as well as my whole sample. The study also provides significant results of long-run post abnormal returns for the <b>spun-off</b> <b>companies</b> up until 756 trading days after the divestiture. Finally, I find the portfolios of respectively small fraction- as well as own-industry spinoffs, to perform significantly better than their counterparts of large fraction- and cross-industry spinoffs...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the stock price}} reaction to cross-border spinoff announcements and investigates whether country characteristics (such as takeover market liquidity and investor protection) cause variation in the announcements' wealth effects. We observe a positive and significant price response to cross-border spinoff announcements. The wealth effects are higher when subsidiaries are located in countries with more active takeover markets. This result implies that investors could expect the newly <b>spun-off</b> <b>companies</b> to become takeover targets. Abnormal returns are lower when subsidiaries are located in countries with weaker investor protection relative to the home country of the parent multinational. We infer that cross-border spinoffs that result in adverse changes in investor protection elicit lower wealth effects. The implications for managers are that spinning off units in foreign markets could generate wealth for parent shareholders, whereas {{the characteristics of the}} markets in which the units are spun-off matter to investors. ...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MBA) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2006. The problem {{addressed}} {{in this study is}} the lack of information relating to the viability of unbundling as a strategy for companies listed on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE). The study sought to determine whether the unbundling of listed companies on the ZSE has resulted in the maximisation of shareholder wealth and an improvement in the performance of the unbundled entities. The sample consists of spin-offs undertaken by listed companies between January 2000 and December 2005. The starting and ending points for the sample period were dictated by data availability. No spin-offs were identified prior to January 2000. The sample frame is composed of seven listed companies that have unbundled and whose unbundled entities were subsequently listed on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange. In total sixteen companies emerged from the seven companies that unbundled and all sixteen companies were studied. Returns of parent and <b>spun-off</b> <b>companies</b> were computed to determine if unbundling resulted in cumulative abnormal returns. The value uplift of resultant firms was compared with the industrial index to determine if unbundling resulted in overall value uplift in the companies that unbundled. Questionnaires were also administered on financial executives of the parent and <b>spun-off</b> <b>companies</b> as well as stockbrokers to establish their views on the outcome of unbundling. The study finds that positive cumulative abnormal returns accrued as a result of unbundling and that value uplift in the resultant companies after unbundling is greater than the value uplift in the industrial index. The study also finds that significant drivers behind the decision to unbundle include the need to unlock shareholder value, focus on core competences and facilitation of future growth. Conclusions drawn from the study are that unbundling unlocks shareholder value, leads to performance improvement, results in value uplift of the unbundled entities and that it results in the elimination of information asymmetry. The study recommends that investors should position themselves in companies that have plans to unbundle as they tend to benefit significantly. It also concludes that unbundling is a viable strategy and consequently conglomerates that have experienced declines in performance as a result of diversification should unbundle...|$|R

This frustrated institutional investors that can only invest in real estate companies and could no longer invest in the new non-real estate subsidiaries. By 1998, Public Storage had $141 million in quarterly revenues, $2 billion in assets and 1,200 facilities in 38 states. Later that year, Public Storage acquired a competing storage company called Storage Trust Realty in a $600 million transaction.|$|R
50|$|Bermuda {{was settled}} in 1609 by the Virginia Company through the chance {{wrecking}} there of its flagship, the Sea Venture. The Virginia company's mandate was made official by the 1612 extension of its Royal Charter to include Bermuda, officially named Virgineola, but quickly renamed The Somers Isles. Later that same year, Bermuda's first Governor, Richard Moore, {{arrived with a}} shipload of new settlers to join the three men {{left behind by the}} Sea Venture. Bermuda quickly became self-sufficient and its requirements were quite different from the still-struggling Jamestown. The shareholders consequently <b>spun-off</b> a second <b>company</b> to manage Bermuda separately. Called the Somers Isles Company, King James I granted it a Royal Charter in 1615, and Tucker was appointed to replace Moore as Governor.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{maintains}} that biotechnology regions develop as complex systems: they start with star scientists in research universities, generating knowledge spillovers, then move progressively towards regional technology markets. In the process they attract venture capital (or modify the behaviour of existing venture capital firms {{with the addition}} of biotechnology portfolios). The routines of universities are also modified {{with the addition of}} intellectual property and technology transfer offices intervening as sellers in the newly created knowledge markets. The paper also considers whether companies located in regional agglomerations grow faster than isolated ones, and whether <b>companies</b> <b>spun-off</b> from universities have a better performance than start-ups. The study is based on about 90 Canadian-based publicly quoted biotechnology companies. Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
40|$|Entrepreneurship {{scholars}} have described entrepreneurship as a holistic process. This has presented conceptual {{difficulties in the}} analysis of technological innovation, particularly the development process of new high-tech small firms, such as spin-offs from public research agencies.

Data from case studies of <b>companies</b> <b>spun-off</b> by universities and other public agencies have been used to explore the relevance of holism and the other constructs as defined to the study of new technology-based firms (NTBF). The implications of these findings for the generation of new high-growth companies were also explored...|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of academic research ("AR") {{to economic growth}} is widely accepted but quantification of incremental impacts, and their attribution to any one country's expenditures, is difficult. Yet quantitative justification of government AR funding is highly desirable. We therefore attempt to quantify one impact which can be directly and causally attributed to one country's funding: spin-off companies. We focus on AR in the non-medical natural sciences and engineering (NSExm) in a whole country, Canada. 'Applied' disciplines are sometimes assumed {{to be the most}} commercializable, so we also separately investigate an especially 'basic' science, physics. Using a novel methodology, we estimate the lifetime impacts of <b>companies</b> <b>spun-off</b> directly from AR performed in 1960 - 1998, and compare the impacts with all government funding, direct and indirect, over the same period. This picks up virtually all funding and most company-formation since WWII, up to 1998. Such long-term studies are rare but essential, since we show that successful spin-offs grow (often exponentially) over several decades. With very conservative assumptions, and allowing for the time value of money, the impacts exceed government funding by a substantial margin. Physics actually fares 30 - 60 % better than the combined NSExm; this reflects more successful companies, rather than greater numbers, and therefore does not seem inconsistent with earlier studies on company numbers. Firm lifetimes are long, with Canadian impacts truncated primarily by some foreign acquisitions. We argue that the spin-off impacts represent incremental contributions to GDP, much larger (even on a time-discounted basis) than the government funding and directly attributable to it; governments will also receive more in additional tax than they spent. The impacts therefore provide a quantitative justification for the public investment, allowing the much more important (but less quantifiable) long-term benefits to be regarded as a 'free' bonus. The very good showing of physics also suggests that reduced emphasis on basic work or on the basic disciplines could actually weaken the commercialization of AR.
