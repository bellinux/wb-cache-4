5|$|Parallel-coupled {{lines is}} another popular {{topology}} for printed boards, for which open-circuit lines are the simplest to implement since the manufacturing consists of {{nothing more than}} the printed track. The design consists of a row of parallel λ/2 resonators, but coupling over only λ/4 to each of the neighbouring resonators, so forming a <b>staggered</b> <b>line</b> as shown in figure 9. Wider fractional bandwidths are possible with this filter than with the capacitive gap filter, but a similar problem arises on printed boards as dielectric loss reduces the Q. Lower-Q lines require tighter coupling and smaller gaps between them which is limited by the accuracy of the printing process. One solution to this problem is to print the track on multiple layers with adjacent lines overlapping but not in contact because they are on different layers. In this way, the lines can be coupled across their width, which results in much stronger coupling than when they are edge-to-edge, and a larger gap becomes possible for the same performance. For other (non-printed) technologies, short-circuit lines may be preferred since the short-circuit provides a mechanical attachment point for the line and Q-reducing dielectric insulators are not required for mechanical support. Other than for mechanical and assembly reasons, there is little preference for open-circuit over short-circuit coupled lines. Both structures can realize the same range of filter implementations with the same electrical performance. Both types of parallel-coupled filters, in theory, do not have spurious passbands at twice the centre frequency as seen in many other filter topologies (e.g., stubs). However, suppression of this spurious passband requires perfect tuning of the coupled lines which is not realized in practice, so there is inevitably some residual spurious passband at this frequency.|$|E

The baseline (no flap) results were found to be in good agreement compared to results in the literature for tests conducted at Reynolds number in the 250, 000 + range. A second set of measurements were then taken for a Gurney flap with a height of 2 % of the chord length attached to the trailing edge of the cascade blades.

The angled bends seen in figure 10 are common to stripline designs and represent a compromise between a sharp right angle, which produces a large discontinuity, and a smooth bend, which takes up more board area which can be severely limited in some products. Such bends are often seen in long stubs where they could not otherwise be fitted into the space available. The lumped-element equivalent circuit of this kind of discontinuity is similar to a stepped-impedance discontinuity. Examples of such stubs can be seen on the bias inputs to several components in the photograph {{at the top of the}} article.|$|E

In this research I studied the effect of mobility ratios on five-spot and staggered waterflood patterns behavior for areal (2 D) displacement in a reservoir that is homogeneous and isotropic containing no initial gas saturation. Simulation was performed using Eclipse 100 simulator.

30|$|It is {{observed}} that case LD (the direct –line drive pattern) and case SLD (the <b>staggered</b> <b>line</b> drive pattern) have similar water-cut trends which {{are higher than}} that of the five-spot waterflood pattern. This is due to the placement of the injectors in line with the producers in distance closer than those obtainable for the five-spot waterflood pattern and allows for the faster movement of the advancing water front toward the producers and hence higher water production and earlier water breakthrough.|$|E
30|$|Also, cases LD (direct- {{line drive}} scenario) and SLD (<b>staggered</b> <b>line</b> drive) are {{observed}} {{to have higher}} oil production rates for periods after waterflooding.

The model is a quarter of an inverted nine-spot and covers 20 acres of field formation. Geologic description was used to construct the simulation grids. The simulation layers represent actual flow units and resemble the large variation of reservoir properties. History match was performed to validate the model. Several sensitivity runs were made to improve the CO 2 sweep efficiency and increase the oil recovery. Finally, the optimum CO 2 injection rate for dolomite formations was determined approximately. Simulation results also indicate that a water-alternating-gas (WAG) ratio of 1 : 1 along with an ultimate CO 2 slug of 100 % hydrocarbon pore volume (HCPV) will allow an incremental oil recovery of 18 %. The additional recovery increases to 34 % if a polymer is injected as a conformance control agent during the course of the WAG process at a ratio of 1 : 1.

The THAI process uses combinations of vertical injection wells and horizontal producer wells, arranged in a direct, or <b>staggered</b> <b>line</b> drive. 3 -D experiments were performed to investigate THAI as a primary recovery method, and also as a secondary recovery method. The latter followed a prior THSF-'Toe-to-Heel Steam Flood'. Oil recovery efficiencies for THAI, using primary and secondary operation modes, were respectively, 80 % and 67 % OOIP. The THSF recovery was much lower, only 23 % OOIP, owing to the low steam temperature in the sandpack. Downhole upgrading of the Athabasca Tar Sand bitumen was very significant, with the API gravity of the produced oil increasing by an average of 8 degrees API, compared to the original bitumen. The produced oil viscosity was also dramatically reduced, to less than 200 mPa s, with a minimum value of 50 mPa s. SARA analysis was used to assess the quality of the produced oil. The original bitumen contained only 15. 5 % saturates, but the amount in the produced oil was increased to 72 %. The high oil recovery factor and partial in situ upgrading achieved by the THAI process could therefore have important economic implications for the future of heavy oil and bitumen production.

A full compositional simulation model using a detailed geologic characterization was built to optimize the injection pattern of section 48 of Denver Unit. The model is a quarter of an inverted nine-spot and covers 20 acres in San Andres Formation of Wasson Field. The Peng-Robinson equation of state (EOS) was chosen to describe the phase behavior during the CO 2 flooding. An existenting geologic description was used to construct the simulation grid. Simulation layers represent actual flow units and resemble the large variation of reservoir properties. A 34 -year history match was performed to validate the model.
