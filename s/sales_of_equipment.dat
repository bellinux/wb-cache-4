China in the 1990s introduced increasingly sophisticated regulations of foreign investment by which access to the Chinese market was traded for technology transfer. The entry of China into the World Trade Organization in 2001 required this practice stop but critics argue that it continues. Chinese critics have argued such technology transfer may be useful for catching up but does not create new, cutting edge technologies.|$|E
25|$|Libya’s {{isolation}} {{became even}} more pronounced following the 1992 imposition of United Nations sanctions designed to force Gaddafi to hand over two suspects indicted for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. The sanctions, imposed on 31 March 1992, initially banned <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> for refining and transporting oil, but excluded oil production equipment. Sanctions were expanded on 11 November 1993, to include a freeze on Libya's overseas assets, excluding revenue from oil, natural gas, or agricultural products. Under these condition, NOC Chairman Abdallah al-Badri emphasized reducing new projects and upgrading domestic facilities. Joint ventures were initiated with Veba, Petrofina, North African Petroleum, the Petroleum Development Co. (Republic of Korea) and Lasmo. Foreign operators were encouraged to produce exclusively for export, limited to national oil companies with pre-sanctions equity in Libya. This policy {{was an attempt to}} contain the amount of crude offered on the spot market through third-party traders, and increase downstream investment. In 2000, NOC was reorganized by the General People's Congress after the Ministry of Energy was abolished, further consolidating control over the sector.|$|E

40|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of six Clean Coal projects revealed that recoupment decisions made by the Department limited its ability to recover the taxpayers` investment. These decisions exempted foreign sales, excluded some domestic sales on certain projects, and lowered the repayment rate on some sales. As a result, the Department may not recoup an estimated $ 133. 7 million of the taxpayers` $ 151 million investment in these six projects and may limit its opportunity to recover future investments in other energy technology programs. An analysis and justification of recoupment decisions would help ensure that the Department is balancing overall program goals of the clean coal program with their recoupment goal. Analysis and justification of recoupment decisions would also facilitate implementation of future Departmental technology transfer programs. These programs are required by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to model their recoupment procedures after those of the Clean Coal Technology Program. Formal financial policies and procedures also had not been established to track, account for, and verify the accuracy of moneys due and collected from industry participants. Repayment policies and procedures would help ensure that the Department collects moneys from successfully commercialized clean coal projects. The Deputy Assistant Secretary for Coal Technology, the Deputy Controller, and the Directors, Pittsburgh and Morgantown Energy Technology Centers, agreed with the report`s recommendations. However, the Deputy Assistant Secretary cautioned that the greatest payback to the nation from the program {{will not be in}} the form of repayment of Federal cost-sharing, but rather from general contributions to a clean environment and economic prosperity (e. g., <b>sales</b> <b>of</b> <b>equipment</b> and jobs creation).
