Lender shall disclose to borrower at least three business days before closing the specifics of the amount required to be in the escrow account and the subsequent uses of the funds.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the factors behind the recent growth of India''s <b>services</b> sector. The high growth of <b>services</b> output in the 1990 s was mostly {{due to the}} rapid expansion of communication, banking, business <b>services</b> (including the IT sector) and community <b>services.</b> While factors such as a high income elasticity of demand for <b>services,</b> increasing input usage of <b>services</b> by other sectors, and rising exports, were important in boosting <b>services</b> growth in the 1990 s, supply side factors including reforms and technological advances also played significant roles. Going forward, the growth potential of Indian <b>services</b> exports is well known, but the paper also finds considerable scope for growth in the Indian <b>service</b> economy provided that deregulation continues. In addition, the paper shows that employment growth in the Indian <b>services</b> sector has been quite modest, thus underscoring the need for industry and agriculture to also grow rapidly.

40|$|Abstract: In Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) environments, <b>service</b> clients {{interact}} with <b>service</b> providers for consuming <b>services.</b> From {{the viewpoint of}} <b>service</b> clients, the trust level of a <b>service</b> or a <b>service</b> provider is a critical factor to consider in <b>service</b> selection, particularly when a client {{is looking for a}} <b>service</b> from a large set of <b>services</b> or <b>service</b> providers. However, a invoked <b>service</b> may be composed of other <b>services.</b> The complex invocations in composite <b>services</b> greatly increase the complexity of trust-oriented <b>service</b> selection. In this paper, we propose novel approaches for composite <b>service</b> representation, trust evaluation and trust-oriented composite <b>service</b> selection (with QoS constraints). Our experimental results illustrate that compared with the existing approaches our proposed trust-oriented (QoS constrained) composite <b>service</b> selection algorithms are realistic and enjoy better efficiency.

25|$|If the PTCS cannot keep up {{with the}} heat load, an External Active Thermal Control System (EATCS) {{maintains}} the temperature. The EATCS consists of an internal, non-toxic, water coolant loop used to cool and dehumidify the atmosphere, which transfers collected heat into an external liquid ammonia loop that can withstand the much lower temperature of space, and is circulated through radiators to remove the heat. The EATCS provides cooling for all the US pressurised modules, including Kibō and Columbus, as well as the main power distribution electronics of the S0, S1 and P1 trusses. It can reject up to 70kW.
