The proposed approach considers balance {{in the number of}} matches each referee must officiate, the frequency of each referee being assigned to a given team, the distance each referee must travel {{over the course of a}} season, and the appropriate pairings of referee experience or skill category with the importance of the matches. Two methodologies are studied, one traditional and the other a pattern-based formulation inspired by the home-away patterns for <b>scheduling</b> <b>season</b> match calendars. Both methodologies are tested in real-world and experimental instances, reporting results that improve significantly on the manual assignments. The pattern-based formulation attains major reductions in execution times, solving real instances to optimality in just a few seconds, while the traditional one takes anywhere from several minutes to more than an hour.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Master of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. One of the main challenges facing the airline industry is planning under uncertainty, especially {{in the context of}} schedule disruptions. The robust models and solution algorithms that have been proposed and developed to handle the uncertain parameters will be discussed. Fleet assignment models (FAM) are used by many airlines to assign aircraft to fights in a schedule to maximize profit. In the context of FAM, the goal of robustness is to produce solutions that perform well relative to uncertainties in demand and operation. In this thesis, we introduce new FAMs (i. e. DFAM 1 and DFAM 2) that tackles the common problem associated with aircraft utilization. Subsequently, stochastic programming (SP) is presented as a method of choice for the research. Through the use of a two-stage SP with recourse technique, the DFAMs are extended to SP-FAMs (SP-FAM 1 and SP-FAM 2). The main distinction of the SP-FAM compared with other FAMs is that, given a stochastic passenger demand, it gives a strategic fleet assignment solution that hedges against all possible tactical solutions. In addition, we have a tactical solution for every scenario. In generating the demand scenarios, we use a network-simulation model embedded with a time-series engine that gives a snapshot of one week that is representative of any other week of the <b>scheduling</b> <b>season.</b> We later outline the approach of solving the SP-FAMs where the schedule is compacted through several preprocessing steps before inputting it into SAS-AMPL converter. The SAS-AMPL converter prepares all the data into readable AMPL format. Finally, we execute the optimizer using a FortMP solver (integrated in AMPL) that invokes branch-and-bound algorithm. We give a proof of concept using real data from a Middle East airline. Our investigations establish clear benefits of the recourse FAM compared to alternative models. Finally, we propose areas of future research to improve SP-FAM robustness through solution algorithms, revenue management (RM) effects, calibration of network-simulation models and system integration...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe demand {{regulation}} for airport infrastructures is managed, {{depending on}} the location within the world, typically by slot allocation schemes. Slot allocation for the biggest part of the relevant airports is organized {{in accordance with the}} IATA Worldwide Slot Guidelines, IATA-WSG. In Europe, Regulation 95 / 93 including its amendments as local rule with relation to IATA-WSG builds the basis for airport slot allocation. Key element of the slot allocation according to this principle is the fragmentation of the declared capacity into time niches, better known as airport slots. A weak spot with this is the usage of the capacity estimation which has to cover a full <b>scheduling</b> <b>season.</b> Those having been allocated a slot are allowed {{to make use of the}} airport infrastructure in general. Demanding airlines without a slot for this airport may request spontaneously a free slot, if available. If not applicable, additional demand's requests are waived. This system limits the serviced demand and assures thereby a reliable level of service at service process stations, e. g. the runway, apron, or terminal. From a strategic point of view this capped demand may cause economic losses due to waived additional airport charges also in situations with capacity well above the average expected value, which was used to calculate the official declared capacity. A second problem with resource usage efficiency arises instead of conservative calculations regarding the available capacity by the variance in resource usage by slot holding airlines. Delayed use of infrastructure may cause excessive demand in later time frames, instead the slot allocation and its levelling effect. Knock-on delays affect the following turnarounds and may destabilize network-wide connections. Especially for the resilience of door-to-door managed networks, process stability is a key ingredient for success. Arrival and departure deviations in aviation may preclude sustainable co-modality by its variability. Both primary as well as secondary delays may jeopardize connections between different or same modes of transportation, and the affected passenger may be stranded at least at the mode's transfer point. By introducing an incentive to avoid primary delays and by foreclosing the propagation of secondary delays within networks, an increase in level of service like process stability or punctuality is realizable. The research topic was to evaluate possibilities to increase resource usage efficiency by changing the methods of slot allocation. Therefore, a priority-based system was created and verified by a simplified microscopic simulation model. Priorities were allocated in advance, representing different categories of resource availability estimation. A second extension to the system was given by a performance-based component. The preselected priority was allocated to the demanding aircraft with up-/downgrades depending on its own punctuality. Despite the increased data exchange volume needed to realize this resource allocation scheme in reality, benefits in resource efficiency and turnaround stability are clearly observable. Different priorities in scheduling are an incentive to schedule with different levels of availability of infrastructures already during strategic planning, whereas the vehicle-oriented performance-based prioritization in operations is suitable to avoid any secondary delay propagation and to increase the system's fairness...|$|E
