The tawny owl's retina has about 56,000 light-sensitive rod cells per <b>square</b> <b>millimetre</b> (36million per square inch); although earlier claims that it could see in the infrared part of the spectrum have been dismissed, it is still often said to have eyesight 10 to 100 times better than humans in low-light conditions. However, the experimental basis for this claim is probably inaccurate by at least a factor of 10. The owl's actual visual acuity is only slightly greater than that of humans, and any increased sensitivity is due to optical factors rather than to greater retinal sensitivity; both humans and owl have reached the limit of resolution for the retinas of terrestrial vertebrates.|$|E

50|$|In a good conductor, {{skin depth}} is {{proportional}} to square root of the resistivity. This means that better conductors have a reduced skin depth. The overall resistance of the better conductor remains lower even with the reduced skin depth. However the better conductor will show a higher ratio between its AC and DC resistance, when compared with a conductor of higher resistivity. For example, at 60 Hz, a 2000 MCM (1000 <b>square</b> <b>millimetre)</b> copper conductor has 23% more resistance than it does at DC. The same size conductor in aluminum has only 10% more resistance with 60 Hz AC than it does with DC.|$|E

One proposal was to devise a unit based on a mercury column that would be coherent - in effect, adjusting the length to make the resistance one ohm. Not all users of units had the resources to carry out metrology experiments to the required precision, so working standards notionally based on the physical definition were required.|$|E

XEOL is a spectroscopy tool {{in its own right}} and can, under the right circumstances, also be a vehicle for x-ray absorption spectroscopy.

A special crane unloads the rail sections and places them {{on each side of the}} temporary track, approximately 3.5 m (12 ft) apart. This operation is usually carried out at night, for thermal reasons. The rail itself is standard UIC section, 60 kg/m (40 lb/ft), with a tensile strength of 800 newtons per <b>square</b> <b>millimetre</b> or megapascals (116,000 psi).|$|E
50|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} are {{the strongest}} and stiffest materials yet discovered in terms of tensile strength and elastic modulus respectively. This strength results from the covalent sp2 bonds formed between the individual carbon atoms. In 2000, a multi-walled carbon nanotube was tested to have a tensile strength of 63 gigapascals (9,100,000 psi). (For illustration, this translates into the ability to endure tension of a weight equivalent to 6,422 kilograms-force (62,980 N; 14,160 lbf) on a cable with cross-section of 1 <b>square</b> <b>millimetre</b> (0.0016 sq in).) Further studies, such as one conducted in 2008, revealed that individual CNT shells have strengths of up to ≈100 gigapascals (15,000,000 psi), which is in agreement with quantum/atomistic models. Since carbon nanotubes have a low density for a solid of 1.3 to 1.4 g/cm3, its specific strength of up to 48,000 kN·m·kg−1 {{is the best of}} known materials, compared to high-carbon steel's 154 kN·m·kg−1.|$|E

There are few coloured oil droplets, which would reduce the light intensity, but the retina contains a reflective layer, the tapetum lucidum. This increases the amount of light each photosensitive cell receives, allowing the bird to see better in low light conditions. Owls normally have only one fovea, and that is poorly developed except in diurnal hunters like the short-eared owl.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: First {{relaxation}} {{stages in}} Si 1 -x Gex layers on Si substrates are induced by annealing of metastable, low-temperature buffer layer samples and observed by X-ray topography (XRT). This method allows observing large area (several <b>square</b> <b>millimetres)</b> {{of a sample}} and reveals very low densities of defects, located in the layer {{as well as in}} the substrate. It allow to follow the evolution of the very first steps of the relaxation, starting with dislocation crosses which were characterized and evolving to misfit dislocation network by very low increases of thermal budget. It is proposed a nucleation mechanism of these crosses based on Frank loops due to point defects condensation which can transform locally in glide dislocations under the influence of the biaxial stress in the film. 1...|$|R
30|$|The {{impact on}} the students’ {{mathematical}} understanding of length, perimeter and area was deemed by the trainer as satisfactory.

However, when required to do the mathematical calculations, they were not able to do so, that is, they could not multiply large numbers to find the area using a pencil and paper. Calculators were then introduced to support the students, with the trainer modelling how to find the area using a calculator.

50|$|The echidna's {{optical system}} is an {{uncommon}} hybrid of both mammalian and reptilian characteristics. The cartilaginous layer beneath the sclera of the eyeball {{is similar to}} that of reptiles and avians. The small corneal surface is keratinised and hardened, possibly to protect it from chemicals secreted by prey insects or self-impalement when it rolls itself up, which has been observed. The echidna has the flattest lens of any animal, giving it the longest focal length. This similarity to primates and humans allows it to see distant objects clearly. Unlike placental mammals, including humans, the echidna does not have a ciliary muscle to distort the geometry of the lens and thereby change the focal length and allow objects at different distances to be viewed clearly; the whole eye is believed to distort, so the distance between the lens and retina instead changes to allow focusing. The visual ability of an echidna is not great, and it is not known whether it can perceive colour; however, it can distinguish between black and white, and horizontal and vertical stripes. Eyesight is not a crucial factor in the animal's ability to survive, as blind echidnas are able to live healthily.Its ears are sensitive to low-frequency sound, which may be ideal for detecting sounds emitted by termites and ants underground. The pinnae are obscured and covered by hair, so predators can not grab them in an attack, and prey or foreign material cannot enter, although ticks are known to reside there. The macula of the ear is very large compared to other animals, and is used as a gravity sensor to orient the echidna. The large size may be important for burrowing downwards.The leathery snout is keratinised and covered in mechano- and thermoreceptors, which provide information about the surrounding environment. These nerves protrude through microscopic holes at the end of the snout, which also has mucus glands on the end that act as electroreceptors. Echidnas can detect electric fields of 1.8 mV/cm—1000 times more sensitive than humans—and dig up buried batteries. A series of push rods protrude from the snout. These are columns of flattened, spinous cells, with roughly an average diameter of 50 micrometres and a length of 300 micrometres. The number of push rods per <b>square</b> <b>millimetre</b> of skin is estimated to be 30 to 40. Longitudinal waves are believed to be picked up and transmitted through the rods, acting as mechanical sensors, to allow prey detection.|$|E

Microfluidics technology offers many advantages over traditional laboratory methods, which include reduced volume consumption of fluids, faster processing speed, and lower costs due to the ability for mass production [1]. Since microfluidics-based biochips are often used in safety-critical applications, reliability {{is one of the most}} important design metrics [1]. In order to recover from erroneous operations, these devices need to be designed for fault-tolerance. Moreover, as the complexity of microfluidics-based lab-on-chip increases, defect density is expected to increase. As a result, efficient runtime recovery techniques are necessary.
