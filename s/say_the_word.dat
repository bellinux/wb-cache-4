5|$|Since inception, {{the network}} has {{produced}} and broadcast notable programs including Sportsview and Sportsworld, a review of international, national and local sporting events. From {{the first week of}} transmissions, children's television series The Channel 4 Club was produced, with children's television program Stopwatch beginning in 1979. English-language educational programme You <b>Say</b> <b>the</b> <b>Word</b> began in 1971, catering to non-English-speaking immigrants. Long-running entertainment program Variety Italian Style premiered in 1974, with Malcom Elliott initially hosting the short-lived Tonight Show in 1981 being replaced by John Tingle a year later. To commemorate WIN Television's 21st year of broadcasting, a one-and-half-hour retrospective montage special was produced in 1983. WIN Television also co-produced telemovie Last Chance in 1986 with a Canadian television production company. Spanning close to a decade, children's television series Goodsports was produced by WIN Television from 1991 to 2000.|$|E

Those who stayed behind—mostly women and children—suffered deeply in their absence. However, the Portuguese discoveries only started in 1415 and since the word {{has been found in}} earlier texts, this does not constitute a very good explanation. The Reconquista also offers a plausible explanation.|$|E
500|$|While {{many parts}} of Rocket Science are {{completely}} fictitious, {{a number of the}} story's details are lifted directly from Blitz's own experiences. In several scenes of the film, Hal is trying to ask for a slice of pizza but cannot <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "pizza"; this is drawn from Blitz's experience of trying to order a hamburger from hotel room service without being able to <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "hamburger". Hal's first debate scene is based on Blitz's first debate, where, for a full eight minutes, he could only make the sound [...] "agh", and the scene in which Hal throws a cello through a window was inspired by Blitz's own destruction of a flute. While Blitz grew up in Ridgewood, New Jersey, he chose to set the narrative in Plainsboro, New Jersey—a place he has never visited—because it was closer to Trenton, rather than New York City. He found it humorous that the characters referred to Trenton as the [...] "Big City" [...] and that Plainsboro seemed to orbit around a dead city, Trenton, in comparison to New York.|$|E

500|$|Confusion {{was caused}} {{prior to the}} {{broadcast}} of this episode when many critics speculated about how the episode would tackle {{the use of the}} word MILF without actually explaining that it is an acronym for [...] "Mother I'd Like to Fuck", as that would have broken Federal Communications Commission rules. The situation was compared to the episode of Seinfeld called [...] "The Contest" [...] which features the subject of masturbation but the characters could never actually <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "masturbation" [...] and did so via metaphors.|$|E

The date goes well, and Stella promises to call if she ever has time. Finally, Abby sees Ted outside the clinic holding flowers he tried to give to Stella, and chases him down the street. She is then seen at the reception telling Barney about how he toyed with her emotions, after which they go out to have sex.|$|E
500|$|Seen {{as a joke}} {{referencing}} {{the demise}} of the Beatles' record label, the Apple logo was presented on Extra Texture as an eaten-away apple core. In addition, the blue inner-sleeve photo of Harrison – [...] "grinning like a Monty Python choirboy", in the words of Robert Christgau – was captioned [...] "OHNOTHIMAGEN" [...] ("Oh not him again"), Harrison's self-deprecating take on his dwindling popularity in 1974–75. The album's full title was a pun on the slogan that street-corner paperboys would yell out to sell late-breaking news editions of their newspapers: [...] "Extra! Extra! Read all about it!" [...] Harrison had intended to call the album Ohnothimagen, until a studio discussion with Paul Stallworth suggested an alternative. According to Harrison, just as he himself was talking about an overdub needing something [...] "extra", Stallworth happened to <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "texture".|$|E
500|$|Vocabulary is also {{restricted}} by class. [...] Freshmen may not <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> Pisshead, a nickname for sophomores.

Juniors are also the first class {{to be allowed to}} say [...] "Whoop!" [...] Seniors, known as [...] "Zips" [...] for the black and gold braid on their garrison caps, which resembles a zipper, have reserved the word elephant and all forms of the words [...] "death," [...] "dying," [...] "shoot," [...] or [...] "reload" [...] in reference to the traditions surrounding Elephant Walk. However, saying the phrases [...] "pass away," [...] "decease," [...] "fire," [...] "load again," [...] etc., are all acceptable substitutes.|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the episode, the family is watching Aquaman on television. Peter is shown watching Jaws 5 on the television, a sequence which MacFarlane describes as [...] "one of [...] favourite gags [...] ever done on the show". Stewie is shown asking viewers to change the channel to one which is showing Desperate Housewives. When Peter is describing Jesus, he does so in a similar manner to that shown on Quantum Leap. Peter's stuttering while attempting to say [...] "wrong" [...] is a reference to a scene in which Fonzie was unable to <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> on Happy Days. At one point a modified video of [...] "Opposites Attract" [...] with Paula Abdul is shown with Peter dressed like a cat. [...] The music playing in the background during the end credits is [...] "Rock Around the Clock", the original Happy Days opening theme; additionally, the credits themselves are shown in a similar style and font.|$|E
500|$|In 2013, the Sihanaka were {{estimated}} to number around 200,000. Families are hierarchical, with parents exercising authoritarian {{control over their}} children. [...] Sihanaka {{men and women have}} significant autonomy in deciding when to marry and whether to divorce. [...] Marriages are disallowed between siblings, cousins, and direct ascendents. To reinforce this forbidden physical intimacy, Sihanaka have historically used a formal term of address when speaking to these particular family members. Mothers are traditionally subject to several fady, such as not being allowed to look at dead infants, eat veal, or eat a particular type of banana once their child had learned to <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> for it. Parents were traditionally responsible for educating their own children, and while today those who can afford a formal education will study at school, parents and the broader community remain collectively engaged in educating children into social and cultural norms and practices. Male children are circumcised by their families no later than the age of seven.|$|E
500|$|... "A Toast to Men" [...] was {{produced}} by Toby Gad, who contributed to the songwriting with Willa Ford and Rhonda Robinson. Tom Coyne served as the track's mastering engineer. The track features vocals by American rapper Lady May. Ford spent roughly two years working on material following the release of her debut album Willa Was Here (2001). The concept for the song was developed from her experiences at a sorority party. While discussing {{the inspiration for the}} single, Ford said that she heard girls at a sorority party doing a chant, and felt like writing a song using it. She was uncertain if her record label would release the song given its provocative content. When talking about her intentions behind the lyrics, she confessed: [...] "I was part of the revolution, as far as changing the way people think of pop music. I wanted it to be sexy and fierce and be OK to <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> 'fuck.' I just needed some time {{to get out of it}} and figure out what the fuck was going on." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite Ice-T's {{attempts}} to differentiate Body Count {{from his work}} in the hip hop genre, the press focused on the group's rap image. Ice-T felt that politicians had intentionally referred to the song [...] "Cop Killer" [...] as rap to provoke negative criticism. [...] "There is absolutely no way to listen to the song 'Cop Killer' and call it a rap record. It's so far from rap. But, politically, they know by saying the word rap they can get {{a lot of people who}} think, 'Rap-black-rap-black-ghetto,' and don't like it. You <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> rock, people say, 'Oh, but I like Jefferson Airplane, I like Fleetwood Mac — that's rock.' They don't want to use the word rock & roll to describe this song." [...] Body Count has since been credited for pioneering the rap metal genre popularized by groups such as Rage Against the Machine and Limp Bizkit, although Ice-T does not rap on any of the album's tracks. Ernie C stated that [...] "A lot of rappers want to be in a rock band, but it has to be done sincerely. You can't just get anybody on guitar and expect it to work. [...] really loved the music we were doing, and it showed." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{beginning}} of the episode, Liz tells Jenna about a bad date that she had with someone she met on the personals section of the Kraft Foods web site, K-date. Pete congratulates Danny on his Juno Award nomination for his Canadian pump-up song for the National Hockey League team, the Ottawa Senators. Danny replies, [...] "It's an honor to be nominated in the same category as Sir Dave Coulier", the latter is an American actor. Liz imitates singer-songwriter Christopher Cross while singing [...] "All my days I've been waiting, for you to come back home. Moonlight of New York City", after revealing that she hoped to end up with Floyd one day and Cross would sing a romantic song about them. This song would be extended on the 30 Rock Original Television Soundtrack by Cross himself. Liz makes reference to the fact that once, on television, one could not <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "crap", but [...] "then they let that slide and now we can say whatever we want." [...] She and Jack exchange the words, [...] "Douchebag", [...] "asswipe", and [...] "Anal rot", as examples. Later, Liz tells Jack, [...] "I don't care. I'll start my own group. Rejection from society is what created the X-Men", which references the comic book superhero team, the X-Men, who are rejected from society due to their mutant special powers.|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the songs}} from The Slim Shady LP are written from the {{perspective}} of Eminem's alter ego, Slim Shady, and contain cartoonish and over-the-top depictions of violence, which he refers to as [...] "made-up tales of trailer-park stuff". [...] The rapper explained that this subject matter is intended for entertainment value, likening his music to the horror film genre: [...] "Why can't people see that records can be like movies? [...] The only difference between some of my raps and movies is that they aren't on a screen." [...] Some of the lyrics have also been considered to be misogynistic by critics and commentators. [...] Eminem acknowledged the accusations, and clarified, [...] "I have a fairly salty relationship with women... But most of the time, when I'm saying shit about women, when I'm saying 'bitches' and 'hoes', it's so ridiculous that I'm taking the stereotypical rapper to the extreme. I don't hate women in general. They just make me mad sometimes.'" [...] Despite the album's explicit nature, Eminem refused to <b>say</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "nigga" [...] on the album, with the rapper noting, [...] "It's not in my vocabulary." [...] The Slim Shady LP begins with a [...] "Public Service Announcement" [...] introduction performed by producer Jeff Bass of the Bass Brothers, and serves as a sarcastic disclaimer discussing the album's explicit lyrical content. [...] Later in the album, a skit entitled [...] "Paul" [...] features a phone call from Paul Rosenberg to Eminem telling him to [...] "tone down" [...] his lyrics.|$|E
