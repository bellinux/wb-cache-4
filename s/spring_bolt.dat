60|$|Saying this, {{he placed}} his lantern on the ground, beside the post {{of one of the}} empty stalls, drew up a small <b>spring</b> <b>bolt</b> which secured it to the floor, and then forcing the post to one side, {{discovered}} a small trap-door. 'Follow me,' he said, and dived into the subterranean descent to which this secret aperture gave access.|$|E
6000|$|He {{approached}} {{him as if}} to speak; but the recluse anticipated his purpose, murmuring in stifled tones, from beneath the fold in which his head was muffled, and which sounded like a voice proceeding from the cerements of a corpse,--"Abide, abide--happy thou that mayest--the vision is not yet ended." [...] So saying, he reared himself from the ground, drew back from the threshold on which he had hitherto lain prostrate, {{and closed the door}} of the chapel, which, secured by a <b>spring</b> <b>bolt</b> within, the snap of which resounded through the place, appeared so much like a part of the living rock from which the cavern was hewn, that Kenneth could hardly discern where the aperture had been. He was now alone in the lighted chapel which contained the relic to which he had lately rendered his homage, without other arms than his dagger, or other companion than his pious thoughts and dauntless courage.|$|E
50|$|Phosphor bronze is {{used for}} <b>springs,</b> <b>bolts,</b> and various other items used in {{situations}} where resistance to fatigue, wear, and chemical corrosion are required (e.g., a ship's propellers in a marine environment). The alloy is also used in some dental bridges.|$|R
5000|$|A Rubik's Snake (also Rubik's Twist, Rubik's Transformable Snake, Rubik’s Snake Puzzle) is a {{toy with}} twenty-four wedges that are right {{isosceles}} triangular prisms. The wedges are connected by <b>spring</b> <b>bolts,</b> {{so that they}} can be twisted, but not separated. By being twisted, the Rubik's Snake can be made to resemble a wide variety of objects, animals, or geometric shapes. Its [...] "ball" [...] shape in its packaging is a non-uniform concave rhombicuboctahedron.|$|R

50|$|A dead bolt, {{deadbolt}} or {{dead lock}} is a locking mechanism distinct from a <b>spring</b> <b>bolt</b> lock because a deadbolt cannot {{be moved to}} the open position except by rotating the lock cylinder with the key. The more common <b>spring</b> <b>bolt</b> lock uses a spring to hold the bolt in place, allowing retraction by applying force to the bolt itself. A deadbolt can therefore make a door more resistant to entry without the correct key.|$|E

60|$|The alien stooped {{and laid}} {{one of the}} thin hands on his own bent head, then dropped it suddenly, for from somewhere far off a faint sound {{scarcely}} more than audible trembled across the forest. Maxwell strove to raise himself to listen, {{but before he could}} speak his lieutenant <b>sprang</b> <b>bolt</b> upright, and his voice rang out. It was the sound of firing, and even at that distance something warned the listeners that the quick beat of it betokened modern rifles.|$|R
5000|$|The {{leaf spring}} {{has seen a}} modern {{development}} in cars. The new Volvo XC90 (from 2016 year model and forward) has a transverse leaf spring in high tech composite materials, a solution {{that is similar to}} the latest Chevrolet Corvette. This means a straight leaf spring, that is tightly secured to the chassis, and the ends of the <b>spring</b> <b>bolted</b> to the wheel suspension, to allow the spring to work independently on each wheel. This means the suspension is smaller, flatter and lighter than a traditional setup.|$|R
5000|$|Compressed air in {{the dump}} chamber overcomes {{the force of the}} <b>bolt</b> <b>spring,</b> pushing the <b>bolt</b> forward. As the bolt travels forward it seals off the feed port and 'uncorks' from the dump chamber. The {{compressed}} air from the dump chamber passes through the bolt and propels a paintball down the barrel.|$|R

60|$|The uneasiness of my {{position}} made my slumber troubled, and laid {{me at the}} mercy of all kinds of wild and fearful dreams; now it was that my perfidious dinner and supper rose in rebellion against my peace. I was hag-ridden by a fat saddle of mutton; a plum pudding weighed like lead upon my conscience; the merry thought of a capon filled me with horrible suggestions; and a devilled leg of a turkey stalked in all kinds of diabolical shapes through my imagination. In short, I had a violent fit of the nightmare. Some strange indefinite evil seemed hanging over me that I could not avert; something terrible and loathsome oppressed me that I could not shake off. I was conscious of being asleep, and strove to rouse myself, but every effort redoubled the evil; until gasping, struggling, almost strangling, I suddenly <b>sprang</b> <b>bolt</b> upright in my chair, and awoke.|$|R

50|$|The Remington 700 {{action is}} {{designed}} for mass production. It is a manually operated bolt action with two forward dual-opposed lugs. The bolt face is recessed, fully enclosing {{the base of the}} cartridge, The extractor is a C-clip sitting within the bolt face. The ejector is a plunger on the bolt face actuated by a coil <b>spring.</b> The <b>bolt</b> is of 3-piece construction, brazed together (head, body and bolt handle). The receiver is milled from round cross-section steel.|$|R
5000|$|The AUG has a {{rotating}} bolt that features 7 radial locking lugs and is unlocked {{by means of}} a pin on the bolt body and a recessed camming guide machined into the bolt carrier. The bolt carrier itself is guided by two guide rods brazed to it and these rods run inside steel bearings in the receiver. The guide rods are hollow and contain the return <b>springs.</b> The <b>bolt</b> also contains a claw extractor that forms the eighth locking lug and a spring-loaded [...] "bump"-type casing ejector.|$|R

50|$|A further notable {{improvement}} for the MP9 was {{the addition}} of a quick to detach barrel, which was cushioned by a <b>spring</b> when the <b>bolt</b> was closed to reduce the effect of recoil on the various mechanisms. The cocking handle was mounted on top of the new stainless steel receiver.|$|R
50|$|Long recoil {{operation}} is found primarily in shotguns, particularly ones based on John Browning's Auto-5 action. In a long recoil action the barrel and bolt remain locked together during recoil, compressing the recoil springs. Following this rearward movement, the bolt locks {{to the rear}} and the barrel is forced forward by its <b>spring.</b> The <b>bolt</b> is held in position until the barrel returns completely forward during which time the spent cartridge has been extracted and ejected, and a new shell has been positioned from the magazine. The bolt is released and forced closed by its recoil spring, chambering a fresh round.|$|R

40|$|INCONEL alloys {{have been}} widely used in light water {{reactors}} for internal structural components, where high mechanical properties and excellent corrosion resistance at high temperatures are required. These age hardenable nickel-chromium-iron alloys have been showing an excellent behaviour during their life service. One of the most important Nickel based alloy is INCONEL 600, which is containing about 76 % Ni, 15 % Cr, 8 % Fe and 0. 5 % Ti. Its microstructure is formed of a majority matrix of γ phase, in which some small precipitates appears inside the grains, {{as well as in the}} grain boundaries. As its mechanical properties at temperatures about 300 ºC were so excellent, this alloy has been used to for internal components, including <b>springs,</b> <b>bolts,</b> guide tube pins, etc. But, in spite of its excellent creep strength behaviour, some Intergranular Stress Corrosion Cracking (IGSCC) phenomena have been appeared in both pressurised and boiling water reactors, showing that this alloy is susceptible to suffer IGSCC. In order to avoid the possible failures caused by this susceptibility, a new nickel base alloy was proposed, INCONEL- 750, which was supposed to be free of this kind of corrosion. In this alloy, IGSCC behaviour was improved by adding some minor alloy elements and changing some parameters in the heat treatment. In some nuclear power plants, this alloy was chosen for the tie rods used to repair the shroud of the reactor vessel in whic...|$|R
50|$|The Škorpion is a select-fire, {{straight}} blowback-operated {{weapon that}} fires from the closed bolt position. The cartridge used produces {{a very low}} recoil impulse and this enables simple unlocked blowback operation to be employed; there is no delay mechanism and the cartridge is supported only by the inertia of the bolt {{and the strength of}} the return springs. When fired, gas pressure drives the case back in the chamber against the resistance provided by the weight of the bolt and its two recoil <b>springs.</b> The <b>bolt</b> travels back, extracting the empty case which is then ejected straight upwards through a port in the receiver housing top cover.|$|R
40|$|Many plasma-facing {{components}} in today's experiments are inertially cooled. Graphite tiles are {{mounted on a}} water-cooled steel plate using a <b>spring</b> and <b>bolt</b> mechanism. When exposed to high heat flux, such a shield can take loads {{only for a few}} seconds without becoming overheated. To operate in high intensity long pulsed/steady-state conditions, new actively cooled heat shields of brazed and non-brazed types are under development. With clamped (form-locked) monoblock tiles a prototype of non-brazed heat shield structure underwent its first high heat flux tests for divertor applications in the Julich MARION ion source [1]. The test results are encouraging, and validated a finite element model as discussed in this paper. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|The front {{suspension}} was independent, using coil <b>springs,</b> and was <b>bolted</b> to {{a substantial}} sub-frame which also carried the recirculating ball steering gear. Semi-elliptic leaf springs were {{used on the}} rear axle. Lockheed hydraulic brakes with 9 in drums were fitted front and rear. The three-speed gearbox had a column change and the optional overdrive was operated by a switch on the steering column. A four-speed floor change became an option.|$|R
40|$|Perennial pepperweed (Lepidium latifolium L.) is an {{invasive}} creeping herbaceous {{perennial weed}} recently found in Green Bay, Wisconsin. This plant {{is capable of}} invading pastures, alfalfa fields, roadsides and many other upland sites, as well as riparian areas, irrigation ditches, floodplains and wetlands. Shoots emerge early in the spring forming a rosette which will persist for several weeks. By late <b>spring,</b> plants <b>bolt</b> producing an inflorescence where flowers will develop. After seed production, flowering shoots senesce, although new rosettes can emerge in the fall in moist soils. Originally from Europe and Asia, perennial pepperweed can be commonly found throughout many western states, but plants have recently been found invading several eastern and Midwestern states. Concern for large-scale spread is high as perennia...|$|R
50|$|Before the Model 1867 was {{put into}} full production, the rifle designer, Friedrich Vetterli, updated the rifle by {{replacing}} the external hammer with an internal cocking <b>bolt</b> <b>spring,</b> rounded front barrel band and placing the cleaning rod {{on the left side}} of the rifle. It was discovered soon after that the cleaning rod in its current placement was easily damaged and was subsequently moved to the under-barrel position. The model was designated the Model 1869.|$|R
50|$|As the {{recoil spring}} returns to its {{uncompressed}} state, it pushes the bolt body backward with sufficient force to cycle the action. The bolt body unlocks and retracts the bolt head, extracts and ejects the cartridge, cocks the hammer, and compresses the return <b>spring.</b> Once the <b>bolt</b> reaches {{the end of}} its travel, the return spring provides the force to chamber the next round from the magazine, and lock the bolt closed.|$|R
50|$|API {{mechanisms}} {{are very sensitive}} to the ammunition used. For example, when the Germans switched their MG FF (an Oerlikon FFF derivative) to their new, lighter Minengeschoß shell, they had to rebalance the <b>spring</b> strength and <b>bolt</b> weight of the gun, resulting a new MG FF/M model with ammunition not being interchangeable between the two models. The 30 mm MK 108 cannon was perhaps the apogee of API blowback technology during World War II.|$|R
5000|$|... 2) The re-cocking cycle - Once the paintball is fired, {{three things}} must happen {{in order to}} return the marker to a [...] "ready" [...] state: 1) the hammer must be pulled back so that it re-engages the sear and re-compresses the <b>spring,</b> 2) the <b>bolt</b> must be pulled back so that another paintball can fall from the feed tube into the breech, and 3) the bolt must be pushed forward after the paintball is loaded to close the breech.|$|R
60|$|It {{was with}} the memory of these {{experiences}} resting heavily upon me that I stood hesitatingly before the stage door. The driver, about to mount, was for a moment illuminated by {{the open door of}} the hotel. He had the wearied look which was the distinguishing expression of Wingdam. Satisfied that I was properly way-billed and receipted for, he took no further notice of me. I looked longingly at the box-seat, but he did not respond to the appeal. I flung my carpetbag into the chasm, dived recklessly after it, and--before I was fairly seated-- with a great sigh, a creaking of unwilling <b>springs,</b> complaining <b>bolts,</b> and harshly expostulating axle, we moved away. Rather the hotel door slipped behind, the sound of the piano sank to rest, and the night and its shadows moved solemnly upon us.|$|R
