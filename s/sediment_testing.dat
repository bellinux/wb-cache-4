40|$|A wetland in west-central Florida was {{studied to}} {{characterize}} the local hydrostratigraphic configuration of surficial deposits overlying more-permeable limestones and conceptualize groundwater recharge. Eight continuous cores were drilled through the surficial deposits and partially into the underlying limestone. A total of 111 samples were extracted from the cores for laboratory sediment analyses and testing. The surficial deposits are roughly eight meters thick and made up of upper and lower clean-sand hydrostratigraphic layers (S 1 and S 3, respectively) separated by a low-permeability layer of clayey sand (S 2). Also, a discontinuous low-permeability layer of clayey sand (S 4) lies between S 3 {{and the top of}} limestone. Equivalent hydraulic conductivity values for the S 2 and S 4 clayey layers (0. 01 and 0. 1 m/day respectively) are significantly less than those of the S 1 and S 3 sand layers (2 and 1 m/day respectively). Significant confinement between the surficial and Upper Floridan aquifers by means of a laterally extensive dense-clay unit immediately above the limestone is consistently reported elsewhere in the region, but was not encountered within the wetland. Partial confinement is apparently the result of low-permeability layers within the surficial deposits alone. Results of ground-penetrating radar and vertical head difference measurements suggest the presence of buried sinkhole features which perforate the low-permeability S 2 layer and create preferred pathways for flow or karst drains. Comparison of results between laboratory <b>sediment</b> <b>testing</b> and a site-scale aquifer performance test (APT) suggest that the primary mechanism for drainage during the APT was by vertical percolation through the S 2 layer while flow through karst drains was minimized. In this case, calculated leakances based on laboratory <b>sediment</b> <b>testing</b> are most accurate in approximation of effective leakance. It is predicted that as water table stages rise within the wetland, effective leakance will increase as flow toward karst drains becomes the more dominant mechanism for drainage. As a result, calculated leakances based on direct laboratory <b>sediment</b> <b>testing</b> are a decreasingly accurate approximation of effective leakance...|$|E
40|$|To assess nickel (Ni) {{toxicity}} {{and behavior}} in freshwater sediments, a large‐scale laboratory and field <b>sediment</b> <b>testing</b> program was conducted. The program used an integrative testing strategy to generate scientifically based threshold values for Ni in sediments {{and to develop}} integrated equilibrium partitioning‐based bioavailability models for assessing risks of Ni to benthic ecosystems. The <b>sediment</b> <b>testing</b> program was a multi‐institutional collaboration that involved extensive laboratory testing, field validation of laboratory findings, characterization of Ni behavior in natural and laboratory conditions, and examination of solid phase Ni speciation in sediments. The laboratory testing initiative was conducted in 3 phases to satisfy the following objectives: 1) evaluate various methods for spiking sediments with Ni to optimize the relevance of sediment Ni exposures; 2) generate reliable ecotoxicity data by conducting standardized chronic ecotoxicity tests using 9 benthic species in sediments with low and high Ni binding capacity; and, 3) examine sediment bioavailability relationships by conducting chronic ecotoxicity testing in sediments that showed broad ranges of acid volatile sulfides, organic C, and Fe. A subset of 6 Ni‐spiked sediments was deployed {{in the field to}} examine benthic colonization and community effects. The <b>sediment</b> <b>testing</b> program yielded a broad, high quality data set that was used to develop a Species Sensitivity Distribution for benthic organisms in various sediment types, a reasonable worst case predicted no‐effect concentration for Ni in sediment (PNECsediment), and predictive models for bioavailability and toxicity of Ni in freshwater sediments. A bioavailability‐based approach was developed using the ecotoxicity data and bioavailability models generated through the research program. The tiered approach can be used to fulfill the outstanding obligations under the European Union (EU) Existing Substances Risk Assessment, EU Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Regulation of Chemicals (REACH), and other global regulatory initiatives. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2016; 12 : 735 – 746. © 2015 SETACKey PointsA comprehensive, representative sediment toxicity database is available to support risk assessment of Ni in freshwater sediments. Sediment Ni ecotoxicity data were gathered from studies that used spiking approaches that resulted in Ni‐enriched sediments resembling naturally contaminated sediments, thus increasing their relevance. Bioavailability of Ni in sediments, which is controlled by acid volatile sulfides (AVS), varies among different species, with actively bioturbating species showing a lower slope in the relationship between decreasing toxicity with increasing AVS. A bioavailability‐based, tiered approach is presented, where the first tier involves comparison of ambient total Ni concentrations with a RWC threshold value of 136 mg Ni/kg. Site‐specific AVS can be used to calculate a site‐specific threshold if ambient Ni is greater than 136 mg Ni/kg...|$|E

40|$|Declines in {{some fish}} {{populations in the}} Upper Danube River, Germany, have been {{reported}} during the past decades despite extensive stocking efforts. Many theories exist for why such declines have occurred including habitat change, dams, invasive species, disease and pollution. One of the factors of concern in the Upper Danube River is pollution because {{a number of studies}} have shown that sediments collected from this area were acutely and/or chronically toxic to fish. Although it can be difficult to link bioassay results to direct effects on the population level, bioassays can give us insight into the potential of exposure of wildlife including fish to sediment. In combination with other researchers a large battery of <b>sediment</b> <b>testing</b> on the Upper Danube River is being performed. Testing includes <b>sediment</b> <b>testing</b> of estrogen receptor mediated processes, dioxin-like responses and genotoxic effects. In this study, four sediment extracts from the Upper Danube River in Germany were used with a novel fractionation technique to characterize the sediment extracts and fractions for their ability to disrupt steroidogenesis, for their mutagenic activities and their teratogenic effects. Fractionation of each of the four sediment samples was performed by separating compounds according to their polarity, planarity, and the size of the aromatic ring system in an on-line fractionation procedure on coupled high performance liquid chromatography columns. Mutagenic activity was measured in the raw sediment extracts and all 18 fractions using the Ames fluctuation assay and the Danio rerio embryo assay was used to assess lethal endpoints. Furthermore, disruptions of steroidogenesis were assessed by first establishing methods and a proof of concept of the H 295 R assay by exposing H 295 R cells to 7 model chemicals and measuring changes from a control in estradiol, testosterone and aromatase activity. Once methods were established all sediments and their fractions were analyzed using the Assay. Specifically, in the Danio rerio assay, two raw sediment extracts killed 100 % of Danio rerio embryos at a concentration of 33. 3 mg sediment equivalents (SEQ) /ml, but none of the 18 fractions of these samples produced any measured toxicity at a concentration of 100 mg SEQ/ml. In the Ames fluctuation assay, significant mutagenic activity was measured in raw sediment extracts and in the fractions. Fraction 10 produced a significant mutagenic response in all sediment samples measured only in S 9 bio-activated samples. Furthermore, fraction 15 produced a significant mutagenic response in all sediment samples measured only in non bio-activated samples. All raw extracts tested in the H 295 R assay caused an increase in estradiol production up to 4 -fold from controls. Testosterone production increased slightly from controls in only two of the raw extract samples. Of the 18 fractions, fractions 7, 10 and 15 increased estradiol in at least three of the samples studied (Sigmaringen 2006, Opfingen 2006, Lauchert 2006 and Lauchert 2004). Furthermore, fraction 7 significantly decreased testosterone production compared to controls in three of the four sediment samples. Taken as a whole, these results show the value of using multiple bioassays and fractionation to characterize sediments that covers a variety of different biological endpoints. This study also demonstrates the usefulness of the H 295 R assay when combined with a new fraction technique to assess endocrine disrupting chemicals in sediment samples...|$|E

Testing of sediment elutriates was undertaken with the ARTOXKIT M, Microtox liquid phase (MLPA), and ROTOXKIT M toxicity assays, while whole <b>sediment</b> <b>testing</b> was carried out with the Microtox solid phase assay (MSPA) toxicity test procedure. Sediment mercury (Hg) content was also determined in each sample since Hg transport and toxicity is specifically an important issue in the Arctic and is generally a key indicator of the pollution status in many aquatic ecosystems. Results and discussion Based on bioassay results and sediment granulometric criteria, these Arctic sediments must be considered nontoxic. However, based on MSPA half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 s) and/or MLPA threshold effect concentration (TEC) values, some degree of toxicity may be measureable particularly in the sediments located in southern and northeast Hudson Bay. The Hudson Bay watershed drains 30 % of Canadian rivers and extends to northern USA. Despite the large Hg concern in the Arctic, the input of local or long-range Hg sources {{does not appear to}} be a contributing factor to sediment toxicity. Conclusions These initial results are valuable in that they set baseline quality levels for these sediments as of 2005. As such, future comparisons can be made to assess temporal and spatial trends. Human activity and climate change is expected to impact these regions in the future, resulting in further reduction of sea ice extent, access to new Arctic seaways, and drilling associated with the exploitation of natural resources...|$|E
40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{industrialization}} {{in the region}} marine pollution assessment in South East Asia is an ongoing and increasingly important environmental science. One of the areas of concern being sediment toxicology, for it has been identified to be a sink for most pollutants entering the aquatic environment. Owing to the scarcity of information on sediment toxicity bioassays, {{there is a need}} to identify species as test organisms for this region. [...] For the purposes of this study, an effects based approach known as Sediment Quality Triad was employed, where three components of environmental concern, namely sediment chemistry, sediment bioassays and benthic fauna alterations were investigated at a chosen location. The study area was a portion of coastline in Peninsula Malaysia with three estuaries, two of which, Sg. Juru and Sg. Perai, have been identified as receiving pollutants from the rivers feeding them. The third, Sg. Tambun, was included for comparison purposes. A reference location of minimal or insignificant contamination and reference sediment from a test organism collection site were also tested to obtain background or reference contamination values. Emphasis was placed on the bioassay portion of the triad to observe the applicability of local test animals to obtain reliable data from established toxicity tests and protocols. [...] The data for each study site comprising sediment chemistry, sediment bioassays and benthic macroinfauna composition were compiled and normalized to the reference values to obtain ratio-to-reference figures and presented in a triangular format, the area of which depicts the degree of pollution induced degradation. [...] Three local species were tested with reference toxicants, the sea urchin (Diadema setosa); oyster (Crassostrea iredalei) and mud crab (Scylla serrata), all had acceptable sensitivity and while the sea urchin was most sensitive to copper while the mud crab was most sensitive to cadmium. With regard to sediment bioassays, an amphipod, Photis longydactylus, seemed very promising for gross <b>sediment</b> <b>testing,</b> while a polychaete worm, Perinereis nuntia, has potential to being amenable for laboratory culture and subsequent use in chronic bioassays. [...] The sediment quality of the three sites revealed Sg. Juru to be most polluted and toxic, but the in situ effects on the benthic community needs to be investigated further. Sg. Perai was moderately toxic and is most likely being contaminated by something other than metals. Sg. Tambun was the least polluted, and least toxic, with a better assemblage of benthic fauna...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, {{the methods}} used to {{determine}} the mechanical properties of marine sediments were those used in the field of soil mechanics. These methods are generally acceptable wiien the <b>sediment</b> <b>tested</b> is plastic or at water contents below the liquid limit. However, for predicting in-situ conditions, that is for sediment at water contents above the liquid limit, the problem is complex. Specifically, the determination of shear strength of an unconsolidated- undrained sample by the direct shear method was found to exhibit an angle of internal friction ranging from 19 degrees to 23. 5 degrees. This indicates that the shear strength of the sediments is dependent on the normal load applied to it. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
30|$|During the project, we {{banned the}} {{sparkling}} wine to the evenings of very exciting and fruitful project meetings. However, as we {{sometimes have to}} deal with sparkling sediments (highly contaminated with shiny PAHs), we tried to set up an ecologically relevant and practicable <b>test</b> battery of <b>sediment</b> contact <b>tests</b> to achieve a reliable and meaningful tool for an effect-based sediment assessment. We filled this project with life (i.e. bacteria, yeast, nematodes, oligochaetes, fish and plants) and cooperated closely, which was the key to the project’s success. At the end of the (far too short) “SeKT” project, we were able to define reference conditions and necessary toxicity thresholds for the various <b>sediment</b> contact <b>tests</b> [8] and succeeded in categorizing polluted sediments in terms of their toxicity [9].|$|R
40|$|Whole <b>sediment</b> {{toxicity}} <b>tests</b> play {{an important}} role in environmental risk assessment of organic chemicals. It is not clear, however, to what extent changing microbial community composition and associated functions affect <b>sediment</b> <b>test</b> results. We assessed the development of bacterial communities in artificial sediment during a 28 day bioaccumulation test with polychlorinated biphenyls, chlorpyrifos and four marine benthic invertebrates. DGGE and 454 -pyrosequencing of PCR-amplified 16 S rRNA genes were used to characterise bacterial community composition. Abundance of total bacteria and selected genes encoding enzymes involved in important microbially-mediated ecosystem functions were measured by qPCR. Community composition and diversity responded most to the time course of the experiment, whereas organic matter (OM) content showed a low but significant effect on community composition, biodiversity and two functional genes tested. Moreover, OM content had a higher influence on bacterial community composition than invertebrate species. Medium OM content led to the highest gene abundance and is preferred for standard testing. Our results also indicated that a pre-equilibration period is essential for growth and stabilization of the bacterial community. The observed changes in microbial community composition and functional gene abundance may imply actual changes in such functions during tests, with consequences for exposure and toxicity assessment...|$|R
