Once eruptions ceased, the ongoing forces of glacial erosion, as well as hydrothermal alteration of the volcano's interior, <b>stripped</b> <b>away</b> layers of volcanic ash deposits and lava flows, uncovering the rocky lava spines where magma had cooled and hardened within the conduits of the volcano. Nearly all the remaining volcanic debris has been partially covered by a younger layer of rock.|$|E

5|$|Earth's {{magnetic}} field stops its atmosphere from being <b>stripped</b> <b>away</b> by the solar wind. Venus and Mars {{do not have}} {{magnetic field}}s, {{and as a result}} the solar wind is causing their atmospheres to gradually bleed away into space. Coronal mass ejections and similar events blow a magnetic field and huge quantities of material {{from the surface of the}} Sun. The interaction of this magnetic field and material with Earth's magnetic field funnels charged particles into Earth's upper atmosphere, where its interactions create aurorae seen near the magnetic poles.|$|E

5|$|By 1911, {{the owner}} Major Richard Winstanley {{was unable to}} pay for the upkeep of the castle and, {{concerned}} about its deteriorating condition, proposed placing the property into the guardianship of the Commissioners of Works. Following a survey by the architect Sir Frank Baines, which showed the ruins to need immediate repairs, the Commissioners took over the castle the following year. It was restored by Sir Charles Peers, the Inspector of Ancient Monuments, between 1912 and 1913. He <b>stripped</b> <b>away</b> any remains of the farm, cleared the vegetation from the walls and repaired the brickwork, re-cutting the moat and reconstructing a replica of the medieval bridge.|$|E
5|$|Temple 22 (Structure 5D-22) is a south-facing {{building}} located centrally on {{the north}} side of the basal platform. Temple 22 underwent three principal phases of construction. The earliest version of this structure was built around AD 250; a second version of the temple was built over it around AD 350; this version was decorated with giant stucco masks. The final version of the temple dates to the 5th century AD. Temple 22 has been extensively investigated by archaeologists with portions of the 5th-century architecture being <b>stripped</b> <b>away</b> to expose the earlier versions. A tomb in the Temple 22 was looted at some point during the Postclassic period.|$|E
5|$|Sampson's {{agenda for}} the 1930 session {{was lost in the}} fights over Ben Johnson and Cumberland Falls. His calls for funding the free {{textbook}} program, compulsory sterilization of the mentally ill, and restrictions on chain stores were ignored. Instead, the legislature continued eroding his gubernatorial powers, including the power to appoint members of the textbook commission. With nearly all of the governor's powers <b>stripped</b> <b>away</b> and given to a three-person commission, Lieutenant Governor James Breathitt, Jr. became the de facto governor for the remainder of Sampson's term. The General Assembly pursued its own agenda, passing a mandatory driver's license law, a revised election law, and a sales tax on retail stores. They also allocated funding for the purchase of what would become Mammoth Cave National Park. Sampson vetoed 12 bills during the 1930 session, but the legislature overrode 11 of them.|$|E

5|$|Situated {{along the}} {{southern}} periphery of a subtropical ridge, Chan-hom moved steadily to the west. Upper-level ventilation allowed for growth of the cyclone, but moderate wind shear displaced the center from the deepest convection for much of July1. That day, the JMA upgraded the system to a severe tropical storm. Early on July2, the large circulation of Chan-hom absorbed a smaller disturbance to its southeast, and the storm turned to the west-southwest. Dvorak satellite classifications indicated that the system reached typhoon intensity following {{an expansion of the}} central dense overcast; the JTWC classified Chan-hom as such by 15:00UTC, although the JMA maintained it as a severe tropical storm. Shortly thereafter, strong wind shear from a Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough (TUTT) cell to the northeast dramatically weakened the storm. Convection was <b>stripped</b> <b>away</b> from Chan-hom's center and the storm's forward motion abruptly slowed. Alongside the shear, subsidence over the cyclone, a trough to the north, and a remnant vortex to the northeast all served to suppress convection. By 12:00UTC on July3, Chan-hom had weakened to a tropical storm with winds of 85km/h (50mph).|$|E
5|$|The Han {{system of}} {{imperial}} government borrowed {{many of its}} core features from the regime established by the Qin dynasty. For example, Gaozu's Chancellor Xiao He (d. 193 BC) integrated much of the statutes of the Qin law code into the newly compiled Han law code. Yet Gaozu's establishment of central control over {{only a third of}} the empire—the other two-thirds of territory was controlled by semi-autonomous kingdoms—strayed from Qin's imperial model which gave the emperor direct control over all of China. However, a series of reforms eventually <b>stripped</b> <b>away</b> any vestiges of the kingdoms' independence. Han emperors thereafter enjoyed full and direct control over China, as had the first Qin emperor. The Han court's gradual move towards reestablishing central control can also be seen in its monetary policy. While the Qin regime installed a nationwide standard currency, the early Western Han regime oscillated between abolishing and legalizing private mints, commandery-level mints, and kingdom-level mints issuing various coins. In 113 BC the Han court finally established the central government's monopoly control over the issuance of a standard, nationwide currency.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish conquest <b>stripped</b> <b>away</b> {{most of the}} {{defining}} features of Maya civilization. However, many Maya villages remained remote from Spanish colonial authority, {{and for the most}} part continued to manage their own affairs. Maya communities and the nuclear family maintained their traditional day-to-day life. The basic Mesoamerican diet of maize and beans continued, although agricultural output was improved by the introduction of steel tools. Traditional crafts such as weaving, ceramics, and basketry continued to be practised. Community markets and trade in local products continued long after the conquest. At times, the colonial administration encouraged the traditional economy in order to extract tribute in the form of ceramics or cotton textiles, although these were usually made to European specifications. Maya beliefs and language proved resistant to change, despite vigorous efforts by Catholic missionaries. The 260-day tzolk'in ritual calendar continues in use in modern Maya communities in the highlands of Guatemala and Chiapas, and millions of Mayan-language speakers inhabit the territory in which their ancestors developed their civilization.|$|E

5|$|The Temple of Awilix is on {{the east}} side of the plaza. Awilix was the patron goddess of the Nijaib lineage and is {{identified}} with Ixbalanque, one of the Hero Twins from the Popul Vuh. According to a drawing made by Rivera y Maestre, the temple of Awilix was not as tall as the temple of Tohil. This structure was apparently the second most important temple in Q'umarkaj. Originally this temple was formed of a large rectangular platform supporting a smaller platform and a temple structure {{on the east side}}. A wide stairway climbed the west side of the temple, it was flanked on the lower level by two large talud-tablero panels. The exterior stonework of the building has been completely <b>stripped</b> <b>away.</b> The temple is similar in form to a temple mound on the west side of the first plaza in Iximche, the postclassic capital of the Kaqchikel Maya. There were four principal phases of construction and there is evidence that the temple had been repaired various times prior to the Conquest. The floor under the third phase of construction had been painted dark green. Archaeological investigations found fragments of incense burners underneath the first building phase.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} Western Han, {{imperial}} relatives and some military officers {{who had served}} Emperor Gaozu were made kings who ruled over large semi-autonomous fiefs, but once the non-related kings had died off, an imperial edict outlawed all non-Liu family members from becoming kings. The emperor's brothers, paternal cousins, brother's sons, and emperor's sons—excluding the heir apparent—were made kings. The emperor's sisters and daughters were made princesses with fiefs. Although the central government eventually <b>stripped</b> <b>away</b> {{the political power of}} the kings and appointed their administrative staffs, kings still had a right to collect a portion of the taxes in their territory as personal income and enjoyed a social status that ranked just below the emperor. Each king had a son designated to be heir apparent, while his other sons and brothers were given the rank of marquess and ruled over small marquessates where a portion of the taxes went to their private purse. Although kings and marquesses enjoyed many privileges, the imperial court was at times aggressive towards them to check their power. Starting with Emperor Gaozu's reign, thousands of noble families, including those from the royal houses of Qi, Chu, Yan, Zhao, Han, and Wei from the Warring States period, were forcibly moved to the vicinity of the capital Chang'an. In the first half of Western Han, resettlement could also be imposed on powerful and wealthy officials as well as individuals who owned property worth more than a million cash.|$|E
5|$|The temple shrine {{was built}} on a final {{platform}} {{on top of the}} fourth tier. The exposed remains of the shrine date to the reign of Oxlahuh-Tz'i'. It had a triple doorway divided by columns and was built from adobe covered with plaster, the columns and walls on eithers side of the doorways were painted with decorations, traces of red, yellow and blue were found by archaeologists, these colours were applied to designs marked out onto a thin cap of clay with a pointed instrument. The quality of the work was very fine and indicated execution by a specialised artist. There were ten painted figures {{on the front of the}} building with further murals on the back. The designs consist of two rows of discs on top of a row of vertical stripes with figures painted against the striped background with the discs above them. The painted figures are performing various actions, one of which is tongue piercing, and they probably represent a Kaqchikel ritual in progress. The painted murals are very poorly preserved due to deterioration caused by damp combined with damage caused by tree roots. The style of the paintings is very similar to that of Postclassic Mixtec art. Exposed parts of the middle phase of construction were damaged and the second phase was covered by the final construction phase, which was badly damaged by the stonework being <b>stripped</b> <b>away</b> for building the nearby town of Tecpán.|$|E
