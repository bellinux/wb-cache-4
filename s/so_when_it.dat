A second minute hand was later added {{to show the}} time in London {{as well as the}} local time in Bristol; the red minute hand shows Greenwich Mean Time and the black minute hand shows Bristol time. This became necessary following the arrival of the railways, which required a standardised time for timetabling around the country, known as railway time; Bristol officially adopted railway time on 14 September 1852. The city is 2º 35' west of Greenwich, <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> is noon in Bristol by old local time, it is just after 12:10p.m. in London by standard time.|$|E
5|$|The 1931 Belize {{hurricane}} was {{the deadliest}} hurricane {{in the history}} of Belize, killing an estimated 2,500people. The hurricane was first detected as a tropical wave off the west coast of Africa on 29August. Moving westward, the disturbance remained relatively weak until 6September, when it was first classified as a tropical cyclone just west of the Windward Islands. The depression gradually intensified, reaching tropical storm intensity within the first six hours following tropical cyclogenesis. The cyclone intensified further to hurricane intensity by 8September. Strengthening and organization remained gradual until the storm reached the Gulf of Honduras, by which time it began to rapidly intensify, reaching Category4 hurricane intensity on 10September. The hurricane subsequently made landfall in Belize City with maximum sustained winds of 135mph (215km/h). Moving across the Yucatán Peninsula, the tropical cyclone weakened, and continued to do <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> moved across the Bay of Campeche. This track brought it to a second landfall north of Tampico, Mexico, as a tropical storm on 13September. Once inland, the storm quickly weakened and dissipated later that day.|$|E
5|$|The {{beauty of}} Beatrice's daughter, Ena, was known {{throughout}} Europe, and, despite her low rank, {{she was a}} desirable bride. Her chosen suitor was King Alfonso XIII of Spain. However, the marriage caused controversy in Britain, since it required Ena to convert to Catholicism. This step was opposed by Beatrice's brother, King Edward VII, and Spanish ultra-conservatives were against the King's marriage to a Protestant of low birth, as her father, Prince Henry, {{was the son of}} a morganatic marriage. Thus, they considered Ena to be only partly royal and thus unfit to be Queen of Spain. Nonetheless, the couple wed on 31 May 1906. The marriage began inauspiciously when an anarchist attempted to bomb them on their wedding day. Apparently close at first, the couple grew apart. Ena became unpopular in Spain and grew more <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> was discovered that her son, the heir to the throne, suffered from haemophilia, a disease for which Alfonso held Beatrice responsible for having brought the disease to the Spanish royal house and turned bitterly against Ena.|$|E

25|$|For example, {{people with}} Tourette {{syndrome}} and related tic disorders make involuntary movements and utterances (called tics) {{despite the fact}} that they would prefer not to do <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> is socially inappropriate. Tics are described as semi-voluntary or unvoluntary, because they are not strictly involuntary: they may be experienced as a voluntary response to an unwanted, premonitory urge. Tics are experienced as irresistible and must eventually be expressed. People with Tourette syndrome are sometimes able to suppress their tics for limited periods, but doing so often results in an explosion of tics afterward. The control exerted (from seconds to hours at a time) may merely postpone and exacerbate the ultimate expression of the tic.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} their {{apparent}} rivalry, Brunel and Stephenson were great personal friends, {{to the extent that}} they supported each other professionally. When Stephenson was under pressure during the enquiry following the collapse of his cast-iron girder bridge over the River Dee killing several people, Brunel did not desert him. In spite of his extreme distrust of the use of cast-iron girders for such purposes, Brunel refused to condemn them when cross-examined as an expert witness. He was also present to provide Stephenson moral support, when the great Britannia box-girders were floated across the river prior to being jacked up to their final positions. <b>So</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> came to the revolutionary design at Chepstow, The Times of 24 February 1852, reported that “Mr Stephenson, the eminent engineer, has examined the (great railway) bridge (at Chepstow) and concurred in the plan adopted by Mr Brunel...”.|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s rule {{changes were}} {{introduced}} to try and limit the effect the loose forwards were having on back play. There was no obligation to bind to a scrum for flankers at this time. The offside line was dictated by {{the position of the}} ball even when it was in the scrum, and <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> emerged {{at the back of the}} scrum the scrum-half would often find the opposition flankers and scrum-half arriving with it. The new offside line became the hindmost foot of the scrum. Only the opposition scrum-half could move forward of that point, and all flankers had to stay bound unless they remained behind the hindmost foot of the scrum. Another rule change introduced allowed the number 8 or the rear-most bound forward to detach from a scrum with the ball, previously it could only be retrieved by the scrum-half.|$|E
25|$|GAV Swan is a six-wheeled terrain assault vehicle. Its {{full name}} is the Ground Assault Vehicle JL-723. It has a {{gyrostabilized}} platform <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> travels over rough terrain, the gunner platform is stabilized. The extended gunner's chair can rise up 3.6 meters above {{the vehicle to}} see over obstructions between the gun and the target, like the long neck of a swan, hence the name. This 6x6 is built for all terrain, and its permalloy armor and four turret-mounted sixty-millimeter rotary autocannons provide protection from the Pandoran environment. The wheels have little armor and are designed with a thick polymer alloy. Swans have a gyrostabilized system that rotates a full 360 degrees. Swans also have a roll bar and four rear headlights. Swans have redundant fuel cells in the rear. When the chair extends, the ammunition storage canister {{is located at the}} back.|$|E
25|$|Both the 1st Airlanding Brigade and 1st Parachute Brigade {{suffered}} heavy {{casualties in}} Sicily, <b>so</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> was {{proposed that the}} division take part in Operation Slapstick, only the 2nd Parachute Brigade and 4th Parachute Brigade were up to strength. Operation Slapstick was an amphibious landing {{at the port of}} Taranto on mainland Italy. The 2nd Parachute Brigade left Bizerta on 8 September, the day before the Italian surrender, and landed unopposed. The only casualties incurred during the operation were fifty-eight men from the 6th Parachute Battalion who drowned after their transport ship HMS Abdiel hit a mine in the harbour. While the 4th Parachute Brigade pushed inland the 2nd Brigade assumed responsibility for securing the port and surrounding area. During fighting around the town and airfield of Gioia del Colle the divisional commander, Major-General Hopkinson, was killed and replaced by Brigadier Ernest Down. Lieutenant-Colonel Pritchard was promoted to Brigadier and given command of the brigade. He was replaced as commanding officer of the 6th Parachute Battalion by Lieutenant-Colonel J. R. Goodwin.|$|E
