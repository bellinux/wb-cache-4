40|$|There is a {{significant}} gap in interprofessional education (IPE) in relation to <b>safeguarding</b> adults.

40|$|Adult <b>safeguarding</b> is {{the subject}} of {{increasing}} attention in England and internationally. This article draws on research which developed a typology of ‘models of safeguarding’. ‘Models’ refer to different ways local authorities in England organise adult <b>safeguarding</b> (about which there is little evidence) rather than ‘model’ approaches to be emulated. The four models identified were: Dispersed-Generic (<b>safeguarding</b> work undertaken by operational teams); Dispersed-Specialist (<b>safeguarding</b> work undertaken partly by specialist social workers located in operational teams); Partially Centralised-Specialist (some <b>safeguarding</b> work undertaken by a central specialist <b>safeguarding</b> team); and Fully- Centralised-Specialist (all <b>safeguarding</b> work undertaken by a specialist <b>safeguarding</b> team). We explored associations between these models and other important variables (numbers of referrals, kinds of alleged abuse and characteristics of adults at risk) and outcomes. The article reports secondary analysis of English local authority <b>safeguarding</b> referral data and on the possible different costs of different models. Dispersed-Specialist sites appeared to have a higher rate of substantiating alleged abuse compared with other models. Statistical correlations were found with types of victim profiles and the perpetrator/victim relationship. It may be that decisions about local organisation of <b>safeguarding</b> are more affected by local organisational contexts than local authority model...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to report the {{findings}} from a study exploring the understanding of vulnerability and adult <b>safeguarding</b> within Christian faith based settings. The article concludes with recommendations for practitioners involved in <b>safeguarding</b> adults in faith based Christian settings. Design/methodology/approach – The paper considers a survey (n= 3182) into understanding of vulnerability and adult <b>safeguarding</b> for individuals who attend Church regularly or work in a Christian organisation Findings - This paper is the first to be undertaken with a UK sample and highlights a range of factors informing adult <b>safeguarding</b> practice within Christian organisations. This includes:- complexity linked to understanding vulnerability and its role in <b>safeguarding</b> activity; lack of clarity about what to do with a <b>safeguarding</b> adult concern, and the need for <b>safeguarding</b> training pertinent to the particular needs of faith based settings. Research limitations/implications - As there is currently a dearth of research in this area this paper makes a valuable contribution to the developing knowledge base around <b>safeguarding</b> and vulnerability within faith based organisations. Practical implications - Professionals need to develop increased understanding of the complexities involved in <b>safeguarding</b> activity, and specifically how those working in the wider context of supporting vulnerable adults make sense of <b>safeguarding</b> processes and procedures. Social implications – It is important that all organisations, including faith based settings, working with adults have an understanding of their roles and responsibilities with respect to <b>safeguarding</b> those at risk of harm. Originality - This paper is the first UK study to consider <b>safeguarding</b> adults at risk of harm in Christian faith context...|$|R

Methods: A review of Local <b>Safeguarding</b> Children Board documentation, observations of Local <b>Safeguarding</b> Children Board training sub-group meetings and a series of interviews with training key stakeholders in each Local <b>Safeguarding</b> Children Board were used to assess how partner agencies in the Local <b>Safeguarding</b> Children Boards carried out their statutory responsibilities to organise interagency training. 'Realistic Evaluation' was used to evaluate the mechanisms by which a central government mandate produced particular inter-agency training outputs (number of courses, training days) and joint working outcomes (effective partnerships), within particular Local <b>Safeguarding</b> Children Board contexts. Results: The 'mandated partnership' imposed on Local <b>Safeguarding</b> Children Boards by central government left little choice but for partner agencies to work together to deliver joint training, which in turn affected the dynamics of working partnerships across the various sites.

40|$|This study aims to {{understand}} the IT threat avoidance behaviors of personal computer users. We tested a research model derived from Technology Threat Avoidance Theory (TTAT) using survey data. We find that users’ IT threat avoidance behavior is predicted by avoidance motivation, which, in turn, is determined by perceived threat, <b>safeguard</b> effectiveness, <b>safeguard</b> cost, and self-efficacy. Users develop a threat perception when {{they believe that the}} malicious IT is likely to attack them (perceived susceptibility) and the negative consequences will be severe if they are attacked (perceived severity). When threatened, users are more motivated to avoid the threat if they believe that the <b>safeguarding</b> measure is effective (<b>safeguard</b> effectiveness) and inexpensive (<b>safeguard</b> cost) and they have confidence in using it (self-efficacy). In addition, we find that perceived threat and <b>safeguard</b> effectiveness have a negative interaction on avoidance motivation so that a higher level of perceived threat is associated with a weaker relationship between <b>safeguard</b> effectiveness and avoidance motivation or a higher level of <b>safeguard</b> effectiveness is associated with a weaker relationship between perceived threat and avoidance motivation. These findings provide an enriched understanding about personal computer users’ IT threat avoidance behavior...|$|R
