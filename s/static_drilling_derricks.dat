5000|$|The Upper <b>Drilling</b> <b>Derrick</b> {{is located}} in a half timbered {{building}} and was restored by a local initiative from 2006 until 2009 and is a Museum since. The Lower <b>Drilling</b> <b>Derrick,</b> directly adjacent to the Brine Reservoir, is still operating and is pumping brine. A small timbered structure was erected over the first brinewell in 1668 which survived until the 1960 and was taken away than to make room for a wider road intersection at Solstraße and Severshuser Weg. It was called [...] "Solhaus" [...] and reconstructed a few meters from the original site in 1992.The old administrative building, Faktoreihaus, of the than state owned salt works was constructed in 1694. It is located on Solstraße and survives in only slightly altered form. On the right hand side of the building is the chapel used for church services until today (2014). The protruding part of the office building was made so that the officers had {{a good view of the}} works area. The building got it´s present form after a rebuild in 1910. There are a few other buildings around Salinenplatz which have been erected in conjunction with the salt works.|$|R

50|$|The idea {{is for the}} {{students}} to practice the particular construct until they can use it spontaneously. The lessons are built on <b>static</b> <b>drills</b> in which {{the students}} have little or no control on their own output; the teacher is expecting a particular response and not providing the desired response will result in a student receiving negative feedback. This type of activity, for the foundation of language learning, is in direct opposition with communicative language teaching.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effectiveness of training drills in replicating the lower extremity coordination patterns used during the triple jump. Three-dimensional kinematic data and synchronized ground reaction force data were collected during the hop-step transition of a triple jump and four related training drills. Relative motion plots and a modified version of the vector coding technique were used to quantify the coordination patterns of the lower extremities. Differences were observed in the coordination patterns between the triple jump and <b>static</b> <b>drills,</b> but not between the triple jump and dynamic drills, and these differences were mainly in the swing (free) leg. The results of this study suggest that if the primary purpose of the training drills is to replicate the movement patterns used in the triple jump, then dynamic drills are more effective than <b>static</b> <b>drills.</b> In addition, coaches should focus on the use of the free leg during these training drills so that the coordination patterns more closely replicate the triple jump. Finally, to provide a more holistic evaluation of training drills, future studies should investigate the similarity of the physical and musculoskeletal demands of jumps and drills...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Aiming at {{the design}} feature and the {{operating}} of K-type derrick, an effective method used to stress real-time monitoring consider environmental loading is proposed. The {{challenge to the}} South China Sea offshore <b>drilling</b> <b>derrick</b> is a illustration. The derrick corrosion and wall thinning conditions is be considered, then using finite element software analyze derrick structure of static analysis, get the higher force about main member of derrick. Based on finite element analysis, select the key parts layout of measuring points, then monitor derrick stress under nine storms environmental loading and extreme work condition. The measured data results show that: the nine storms environmental load affect capacity of drilling significantly, the {{different parts of the}} main member stress have the different degrees of influence by environmental load, the maximum can reach 50. 8 %. This real-time monitoring method of stress, can protect the safety of marine operations, has a certain value of engineering application...|$|R

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the improvement in}} the horizontal directional drilling method (HDD) by using an autonomous land vehicle (ALV) with a radio directional finding (RDF) system. The ALV with an RDF system carrying a receiver can locate a moving or <b>static</b> underground <b>drill</b> head and track it. Not limited to a pre-determined track or path, the ALV system utilizes its on board RDF system instantaneously to seek and to track a moving or <b>static</b> <b>drill</b> head. Compared to conventional systems, the system reduces the number of operators, minimizes labor costs, prevents accidents, and enhances the degree of automation.   The design of the RDF system and how to locate a target are considered in this article. To overcome the difficulty in obtaining the precise dynamic model of the ALV with the RDF system, a “fuzzy logic controller” is designed to control such a system and make the system capable of tracking a target. Experimental results verify that such an RDF ALV system can track a moving or static target. ...|$|R

50|$|In {{the oil and}} gas industries, {{coiled tubing}} refers to a very long metal pipe, {{normally}} 1 to 3.25 in in diameter which is supplied spooled on a large reel. It is used for interventions in oil and gas wells and sometimes as production tubing in depleted gas wells. Coiled tubing is often used to carry out operations similar to wirelining. The main benefits over wireline are the ability to pump chemicals through the coil and the ability to push it into the hole rather than relying on gravity. Pumping can be fairly self-contained, almost a closed system, since the tube is continuous instead of jointed pipe. For offshore operations, the 'footprint' for a coiled tubing operation is generally larger than a wireline spread, which can limit the number of installations where coiled tubing can be performed and make the operation more costly. A coiled tubing operation is normally performed through the <b>drilling</b> <b>derrick</b> on the oil platform, which is used to support the surface equipment, although on platforms with no drilling facilities a self-supporting tower can be used instead. For coiled tubing operations on sub-sea wells a Mobile Offshore Drilling Unit (MODU) e.g. semi-submersible, Drillship etc. has to be utilized to support all the surface equipment and personnel, whereas wireline can be carried out from a smaller and cheaper intervention vessel. Onshore, they can be run using smaller service rigs, and for light operations a mobile self-contained coiled tubing rig can be used.|$|R

After getting confirmation of {{the usefulness of the}} product from Yale chemist Benjamin Silliman Jr., he and his partner, Jonathan Eveleth, formed the Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company for this purpose. In 1856, after seeing pictures of <b>derrick</b> <b>drilling</b> for salt, Bissell conceived of the idea of drilling for oil, rather than mining it. This was widely considered ludicrous at the time but on August 27, 1859, the company first succeeded in striking oil, on a farm in Titusville, Pennsylvania. Bissell invested heavily in the surrounding region and ended up becoming a wealthy business man.|$|R
5000|$|The Elgin-Franklin {{development}} {{is located in}} the Central Graben Area of the North Sea 240 km east of Aberdeen, Scotland at a water depth of 93 m. The installation consists of three separate platforms, two of which are connected by a 90 m bridge: two wellhead platforms which house the wells, one each for the Elgin and Franklin reservoirs, and the process, utilities and quarters (PUQ) platform, which is the central processing platform. The PUQ is a pile mounted jack up design which contains hydrocarbon processing facilities, control systems and accommodation for the crew of 97. The structure was built by BARMAC in Nigg, Scotland, and installed in July 2000. The facility has a processing capacity of [...] of gas and [...] of condensate. The Franklin wellhead platform (WHP) has nine well slots (seven wells on the Franklin Field and two extended reach wells on West Franklin) [...] It is not normally manned but has a helideck and shelter for up to 20 people. The Elgin wellhead platform has 12 well slots (11 wells on Elgin and one extended reach well on Glenelg). The platforms are linked to the PUQ by flowlines and were installed in 1999. The WHP has no installed <b>drilling</b> facilities (<b>derrick,</b> etc.). Well <b>drilling</b> and workover services are provided when needed by a jack up rig which operates in tender mode.|$|R
40|$|Reelwell has {{developed}} the Reelwell Drilling Method (RDM), including the Heavy Over Light (HOL) solution. The HOL solution allows drilling with simultaneously use {{of two different}} drilling fluids, i. e. a near <b>static</b> <b>drilling</b> fluid with high density for pressure control {{on the outside of}} the drill string and a lighter drilling fluid for hole cleaning inside the dual drill string. The HOL solution implies the creation of an interface mixing zone between the heavy and the light fluid in the well annulus outside the drill string. The HOL solution is mainly used in horizontal sections of the well and provides increased buoyancy which reduces torque and drag of the drill string. The solution may also be useful in vertical wells due to the possibility of deeper setting depth for casings. This goal for this work is to investigate the HOL solution in vertical sections of a well through simulations using the COMSOL Multiphysics software and experimental work. For the simulations there were defined several parameters, such as density, plastic viscosity, and well size. The aim of the simulations was to study the effect of these parameters on the HOL mixing zone. The experiments were performed in vertical cylindrical tubes, using water based mud or oil based mud with various densities and rheology properties. In some of the experiments a pipe inside the tube was rotated to assist the mixing process. Through the experimental work it was found that yield strength (YS) and low shear yield stress (LSYS) has a reducing effect on the development of the mixing zone. Rotation of the inner pipe made the fluids mix more evenly. The COMSOL simulations indicated that density and well size affect the speed of the development of the mixing zone, while plastic viscosity has no or little effect. COMSOL did not prove to model the mixture process in accordance with the experimental observations. For further work it may be desirable to further investigate the theoretical model and to study the effect of other parameters, such as rheology properties of the fluids, rotational force of an inner pipe and friction from pipe wall...|$|R

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the acute honey bee poisoning events observed in several European countries during maize drilling, the dust drift topic has received increasingly more attention. We aimed to quantify the dust drift risk, develop reduction measures and innovate sowing techniques using an integrated experimental and modelling approach. To validate and finetune the dust drift CFD-models under development, the designs of three selected sowing machines and associated tractors were digitised. For the two pneumatic drills, the airflows around the machines and at the in- and outlet air ducts were measured. Air velocities at the outlets ranged from only 0. 11 m s- 1 for the pneumatic bulk drill up to 26. 1 m s- 1 for the pneumatic precision drill without deflector. The use of a deflector reduced the exit velocities to 13. 4 m s- 1 as well as the air velocities around the machine.

The flow-loop and the layout of the flow-loop are shown in Figs.  3 and 4, respectively. The flow-loop as shown in Fig.  3 was designed with a concentric annular test section of 16 ft (4.9  m) long acrylic pipe, with 3.5 -in. (0.089  m) ID that acted as a simulated wellbore/casing. The <b>static</b> inner <b>drilled</b> PVC pipe was built with 2.4 in. (0.609  m) and sealed at both ends. The annulus test section was adjusted for five different hole-angles (0 °, 45 °, 60 °, 75 °, and 90 °) as shown in Fig.  5 a–e during the experiments. The mud was circulated using a 2 -hp variable speed centrifugal pump with the capacity of about 20 – 42  L/min (181.2 – 380.52 bbl/day). In order to trap the cuttings, separation tank was mounted after the annulus section, and was fitted with wire mesh of 0.2  mm.
