30|$|When {{analysing}} {{the role}} of e.g. <b>car</b> <b>drivers</b> in accidents, one should focus on all fatalities resulting from accidents. Specifically, considering only the killed <b>car</b> <b>drivers</b> themselves underestimates the overall role of <b>car</b> <b>drivers</b> in accidents. Thus counterpart persons {{should be included in}} the analyses as well. For example, in our data 45 % of the Finnish and 59 % of the Swedish <b>car</b> <b>drivers</b> involved in fatal accidents would have been ignored if we had analysed killed <b>car</b> <b>drivers</b> only. Such underestimation would also have led to further bias from ignoring all accidents causing fatal injuries to counterpart persons, among them most collisions with pedestrians.|$|R

30|$|As can be {{seen from}} Table  9, the results of all three {{statements}} are quite consistent, showing that about two thirds of all respondents believe that company <b>car</b> <b>drivers</b> and privately owned <b>car</b> <b>drivers</b> have different driving styles. Moreover, about a quarter of all respondents specifically agreed that company <b>car</b> <b>drivers</b> drove more aggressively and less carefully.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of a study of attitudes and {{behavioral}} responses of <b>car</b> <b>drivers</b> to planned parking measures at the campus of the Eindhoven University of Technology, the Netherlands. In an on-street questionnaire, <b>car</b> <b>drivers</b> were asked their opinion about restricting access to the campus area for cars of non-university <b>car</b> <b>drivers</b> through (i) a barrier, (ii) proper identification when entering the campus area, and (iii) payment. The responses of more than 700 <b>car</b> <b>drivers</b> are used in a multinomial logit analysis. Most <b>car</b> <b>drivers</b> indicate to continue driving to the university by car. Almost half of the <b>car</b> <b>drivers</b> indicate that they will change their travel behavior should they have to pay for entering the campus area by changing transport mode or parking their car outside the campus area. Respondents are invariant with respect to different types of identification. The most favorite way of paying is by bank/credit card, followed by a special university card...|$|R
30|$|Our {{results suggest}} that in both countries, the {{population}} risk of a male being involved in a fatal accident as a <b>car</b> <b>driver</b> {{is much higher than}} for respective females. Comparing the age and gender of <b>car</b> <b>drivers</b> involved in fatal accidents revealed that Finland has a safety potential especially among young (<= 25  years) and elderly (> 70  years) male <b>car</b> <b>drivers.</b> The potential is highest for novice car drivers; achieving the same population safety as in Sweden would every year save nine fatalities in accidents involving an 18 – 19 -year-old man as a <b>car</b> <b>driver.</b>|$|R

After working as a driver trainer for several years Correia was appointed as the official WTCC safety <b>car</b> <b>driver.</b> After the 2009 FIA WTCC Race of France in which racing driver Franz Engstler hit the inexperienced safety <b>car</b> <b>drivers</b> (employed by the French ASN, rather than the FIA) the FIA decide to employ a permanent safety <b>car</b> <b>driver.</b> After a testday at Masaryk Circuit Correia was appointed as the safety <b>car</b> <b>driver</b> for the WTCC and its support classes.|$|R

50|$|Not to be {{confused}} with German race <b>car</b> <b>driver</b> Lucas WolfLucas Wolfe (born October 22, 1986) is an American race <b>car</b> <b>driver.</b> He currently competes in the World of Outlaws (WoO) Sprint Car Series.|$|R
30|$|Comparisons of {{the attitudes}} of the two {{sub-samples}} indicate that privately owned <b>car</b> <b>drivers</b> agree with the statements, “Most people drive differently in a company car compared to a privately owned car” and “In a privately owned car, driving style is more careful compared to a company car” significantly more than do company <b>car</b> <b>drivers.</b> It {{is important to note that}} company <b>car</b> <b>drivers</b> agree significantly more than do their counterparts with the statement, “In a company car it is possible to drive more aggressively compared to a privately owned car”. The second and third statements try to catch the same issue of comparing perceptions regarding driving style. It makes sense that people response differently to a positive presentation (driving style is more careful) versus a negative presentation (driving style is more aggressive); it is not trivial to make self-statements about aggressive driving style due to having a company car. This result points out that a relatively more aggressive driving style in company cars is perceived as common, not only among privately owned <b>car</b> <b>drivers,</b> but even more so among company <b>car</b> <b>drivers.</b> Consequently, the driving behavior of company <b>car</b> <b>drivers</b> might reflect the perception and, hence, be less safe than that of privately owned <b>car</b> <b>drivers.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study the {{perception}} of elderly <b>car</b> <b>drivers</b> as a hazard in traffic. The questions of the study were: how is the perception of older <b>car</b> <b>drivers</b> as a hazard in traffic, do the perception correspond with research based facts, and does the view differs between men and women. The first hypothesis is that older <b>car</b> <b>drivers</b> are viewed as more inappropriate <b>car</b> <b>drivers,</b> than what is warranted by established facts. The second is that vision and reaction time are causes of older <b>car</b> <b>drivers</b> that make them inappropriate as <b>car</b> <b>drivers.</b> The respondents were university students selected from various subjects. Thirty-four answers were received from women and 40 from men. These received an Internet link leading to a web based questionnaire. Their perceptions didn’t match earlier results entirely, but the view was often not far from matching. The view was more negative regarding three questions, than there’s support for. There {{were no significant differences}} in the perception between men and women. Validerat; 20150202 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R
