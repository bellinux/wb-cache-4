Third, MEGAN assigns a taxon ID to processed read results based on NCBI taxonomy which creates a MEGAN file that contains required information for statistical and graphical analysis. Lastly, lowest common ancestor (LCA) algorithm can be run to inspect assignments, to analyze data {{and to create}} <b>summaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> based on different NCBI taxonomy levels. LCA algorithm simply finds the lowest common ancestor of different species.|$|E

5000|$|The {{number of}} DSBs created during meiosis can {{substantially}} exceed {{the number of}} final CO events. In the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, only about 4% of DSBs are repaired by CO recombination, suggesting that most DSBs are repaired by NCO recombination. Data based on tetrad analysis from several species of fungi show that only a minority (on average about 34%) of recombination events during meiosis are COs (see Whitehouse, Tables 19 and 38 for <b>summaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> from S. cerevisiae, Podospora anserina, Sordaria fimicola and Sordaria brevicollis). In the fruit fly D. melanogaster during meiosis in females {{there is at least}} a 3:1 ratio of NCOs to COs. [...] These observations indicate that the majority of recombination events during meiosis are NCOs, and suggest that SDSA is the principal pathway for recombination during meiosis. The major function of SDSA during meiosis presumably is to repair DNA damages, particularly DSBs, in the genomes to be passed on to gametes (see Genetic recombination).|$|E
