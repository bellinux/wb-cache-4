5|$|Italian armies easily outnumbered {{those of}} the British, who were {{defending}} multiple areas in North Africa with skeleton forces. With Cyrenaica and the Sudan under threat as well as <b>Somaliland,</b> only token units were available to control what was considered a relatively unimportant possession. In fact, until December 1939 British policy had been to abandon <b>Somaliland</b> altogether {{in the face of}} invasion. However, General Archibald Wavell, the newly appointed commander of British armies in Africa, successfully recommended to the British Chiefs of Staff that <b>Somaliland</b> be defended. A multiracial congregation of five battalions, the minimum force that was adjudged capable of defending the region, was assembled by the beginning of August.|$|E
5|$|Just {{prior to}} {{independence}} in 1960, the Trust Territory of Somalia established a national army {{to defend the}} nascent Somali Republic's borders. A law to that effect was passed on 6 April 1960. Thus the Somali Police Force's Mobile Group (Darawishta Poliska or Darawishta) was formed. 12 April 1960 has since been marked as Armed Forces Day. British <b>Somaliland</b> became independent on 26 June 1960 as the State of <b>Somaliland,</b> and the Trust Territory of Somalia (the former Italian <b>Somaliland)</b> followed suit five days later. On 1 July 1960, the two territories united to form the Somali Republic.|$|E

The United States recognized and established diplomatic relations with the Somali Republic the same day. The Consulate-General was elevated to embassy status and its Chargé d'affaires, Andrew G. Lynch, was appointed ambassador on July 5. He presented his credentials on 11 July, at which point he officially became the first US ambassador to Somalia.|$|E

On 20 July 1961 and through a popular referendum, the people of Somalia ratified a new constitution, which was first drafted in 1960.

5|$|As Italy {{entered the}} war at the {{conclusion}} of the Battle of France, their Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini looked to Africa as a possible location for easy propaganda victories to justify his joining the conflict and to glorify Italy's hitherto speculative role it. The British <b>Somaliland</b> colony, a weakly defended area located in modern Somalia, looked to the dictator easy prey. Despite Italy being logistically unready for a conflict in that region, an attack on <b>Somaliland</b> was authorized, set for late 1940. Italian forces in East Africa were relatively strong in numbers, if not in quality, with 29 colonial brigades, each consisting of several infantry battalions and some light artillery, concentrated around the recently conquered Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. The Italians also possessed at least 60 medium and light tanks and 183 aircraft, both fighters and medium/light bombers.|$|E
5|$|Despite the boasting of Mussolini and {{the fury}} of Churchill, the loss of Tug Argan and {{consequently}} <b>Somaliland</b> was not of the greatest strategic importance. Certainly it was a blow to British prestige and pride, but <b>Somaliland</b> was one of Britain's lesser regions of value and could be affordably lost. In fact, Britain incurred monetary gains after being relieved of the necessity to station an expensive garrison there. But the impact could have been far greater if the Italians had managed to move faster after the battle. Heavy rains and difficulties supplying the troops damaged these efforts, as well as removed any chance of a sizable strategic victory.|$|E
5|$|In 1905, Italy made Mogadishu {{the capital}} of the newly {{established}} Italian <b>Somaliland.</b> The Italians subsequently referred to the city as Mogadiscio. After World War I, the surrounding territory came under Italian control with some resistance.|$|E

5|$|In July 1914, Cubitt was {{appointed}} Deputy Commissioner and Officer Commanding for the <b>Somaliland</b> Protectorate; after the disastrous Battle of Dul Madoba, the colonial administration {{was seeking to}} restore British control over the inland areas of the Protectorate. Cubitt planned and commanded a series of operations through the winter of 1914-15, destroying several Dervish forts. Shortly after he arrived in <b>Somaliland,</b> the First World War had broken out, and once the winter campaign was over he requested {{to be transferred to}} Europe; the request was granted, but it took until early 1916 for him to be replaced and make his way home. For his services in Africa, he {{was appointed}} a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George and a Companion of the Bath, and promoted to brevet Colonel.|$|E
5|$|Italian forces entered British <b>Somaliland</b> from Abyssinia on 4 August 1940, {{overcame the}} {{garrison}} at Hargeisa, and advanced north-east towards the capital Berbera. The British force, including {{a platoon of}} 43 Rhodesians in the 2nd Battalion of the Black Watch, took up positions on six hills overlooking the only road towards Berbera and engaged the Italians at the Battle of Tug Argan. Amid heavy fighting, the Italians gradually made gains and by 14 August had almost pocketed the Commonwealth forces. The British retreated to Berbera between 15 and 17 August, the Rhodesians making up the left flank of the rearguard, and by 18 August had evacuated by sea. The Italians took the city and completed their conquest of British <b>Somaliland</b> a day later.|$|E
