A variation of distributed capture is thin-client {{document capture}} in which documents are scanned into a central server through the use of web browser. One of these web-based products was reviewed by AIIM. They said, [...] "(this product) is a thin-client distributed capture system that streamlines the process of acquiring and creating documents." [...] The streamlining is a result of several factors including the lack of software which needs to be installed at every scanning station and the variety of input sources from which documents can be captured. This includes things like email, fax, or a watched folder.|$|E

40|$|Reduced funding, global {{competition}} and technological change are forcing libraries and information centres {{to turn to}} new methods of providing services. Publishers of scientific and technical information expect printed journals to remain their primary product for several more years, despite the advent of electronic journals. Library collections {{will continue to be}} largely paper-based, but clients will demand much faster document delivery services from them. Many libraries must also maximize the investment in their collections by expanding their clientele. Electronic <b>scanning</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> coupled with transmission over high-speed, high-capacity networks offers a potential solution to these problems. For more than a year, CISTI has been using proprietary imaging workstations to supply documents to one of its branches. Much more flexibility is needed to reach the disparate receiving equipment used by a varied Canadian and international clientele. Describes experience with the Ariel Workstation, developed by the Research Libraries Group, and CISTI's own work towards a generic imaging workstation, able to transmit to a variety of receivers including identical scanning workstations, other workstations, facsimile machines and microcomputers with facsimile boards. Ability to rationalize library collections is seen as an important consequence. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|A {{prototype}} {{system for}} concurrent printing and <b>scanning</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> has been constructed. By taking {{a personal computer}} ink-jet printer and modifying it to include a line-scan sensor, major benefits are derived. Both conventional printers and scanners contain mechanisms for moving either documents, sensors or mirrors. Combining a printer and a scanner into a single device offers a potential reduction in cost because the printer's mechanisms then serve a double duty. A scanner makes available to the personal computer user established commercial applications such as image digitization and facsimile. Moreover, unique document processing features are possible when a scanner is present in a printing device. With documents already containing some information, intelligent printing annotation can be performed. For example, a previously scanned and digitized picture can be printed on a new document already containing text and open space. Scaling, positioning and printing of the digitized picture to fit within the open space is archived through scanning and analyzing the new document. The physical and functional characteristics of the printer/scanner system are described. Principles relevant to the design, construction and application of the printer/scanner are given, and present and future applications discussed. by Jeffrey David Keast. Thesis (M. S. V. S.)

40|$|Information {{retrieval}} is {{the task}} <b>of</b> finding <b>documents,</b> usually text, which are relevant to a user's information need.

Information explosion and application of ICT for proper handling, retrieval and dissemination of information necessitates the need for digital preservation. With the growing emphasis on technology, libraries have undergone major structural changes {{in terms of their}} collection, organization and services. Digital library do have many advantages over print materials, but require higher skills and hardware for creating, organizing and disseminating information to the users on their desktops. Creation of digital library involves selection of materials, <b>scanning</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> and WWW for providing access to the information on the internet. Creation and management of digital library is similar to traditional library collection building activity but the medium of information, method of acquition and storage are different. Copyright licensing and other legal issues become very crucial while creating digital library. New strategies may have to adopt for collection, delivery of information and manpower development. Preservation {{is one of the most}} serious concerns for the libraries with electronic contents whether purchased or converted in-house. Preserving collections for the long term is a primary concern in the digital era. The lack of standardization, formats, hardware, network interfaces and storage devices are constant threat of techno-obsolescence and transitory standards. Another challenge is to make collections more easily and widely accessible via electronic devices.
