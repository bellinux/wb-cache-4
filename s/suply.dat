5000|$|In mid April, {{some signs}} {{showed that the}} imperials will retreat from Pest, like {{the return of the}} cotton bags to the {{inhabitants}} confiscated before by the commandment, in order to build defenses around the town. On the other hand, Welden wrote an letter to Hentzi in which he orders him to defend the Danube line, or at least the Buda castle until [...] "the condition of the defense utilities of the castle bastions, and your food <b>suply</b> makes it possible". The high commander drew Hentzi's attention to respond only with bullets and grapeshot against attacks and gun fire coming from the direction of Pest, and to not use cannons, in order to spare the splendid buildings of the city, allowing him to do the opposite only if the population of Pest would behave towards the imperials in an unacceptable manner. But Hentzi will not respect this order, and will bombard Pest, destroying the Classicist styled buildings from the shores of the Danube, and others from Pest, {{despite the fact that the}} inhabitants of the city did nothing in order to provoke him, and the personal request of Görgei in this regard. The letter informs Hentzi that the food supply of the castle is enough for 6 weeks and there is enough ammunition for the defense. It also states that the cannons to find in Buda and Pest must be brought in the castle, the waterworks which enables the defenders to be supplied with water from the Danube, must be strengthened with banqettes for cannons, the palisades from the left bank of the Danube, because they could be advantageous for the enemy, must be removed.Major General Heinrich Hentzi was (1785-1849) was an experienced officer with deep knowledge in engineering, so he was suitable for leading the technical and logistical preparations for the defense of the castle. He actually started the preparations in January 1849, after he was appointed as the leader of the renovations of the castle, after he presented himself to Field Marshal Windisch-Grätz when he occupied the capitals. In the winter of 1849 Hentzi conducted the building of the edifices which protected the exits of the Chain Bridge and the palisade from the left exit of the Chain Bridge and the Újépület (New Building). But after finishing those, the works stopped, because they left without money.|$|E

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{distribution}} and the controlling factors of rare earth element (REE) total concentrations and fractionation patterns in fine sediment fractions of 53 samples collected along the main channels of the Ria de Aveiro, a northern Portuguese coastal lagoon. Total and available concentrations and residual phases of REE and total concentrations in three chemically partitioned fractions (S 1 - adsorbed by clay and co-precipitated with carbonates; S 2 - adsorbed by organic matter; S 3 - adsorbed by amorphous Mn hydroxides) are analysed. These data are joinly analysed with physicochemical, textural and mineralogical and other geochemical data. Sediment samples mainly consisted of phyllosilicates, quartz, plagioclase and K–feldspars. Cerium (Ce) is the most abundant REE in the residual phase and displays the lowest total available percentage, whereas Yttrium (Y) is the most available. The highest total concentration and residual concentration (R) of Ce, Lanthanum (La), Scandium (Sc) and Y are mostly related to fine grained sediments, suggesting that their distributions are conditioned by lagoon hydrodynamics. The dissimilar distribution of REE-S 1, REE-S 2 and REE-S 3 indicates differentiated sedimentary processes. The enrichment of REE-S 2 and REE-S 3 is related essentially to biogeochemical processes inside the lagoon. The REE-S 1, as well as Ce-S 1 /Sc-R, trace sediments supplied from the northern areas <b>suplyed</b> mostly by the Douro River outflow and from the Antuã River. In the past, the sediments <b>suplyed</b> by the Douro River through the litoral drift contributed {{to the formation of}} the lagoon islands. Thus the relatatively high Ce-S 1 /Sc-R values inside the lagoon allowed the identification of: sediments supplied from the litoral drift and deposited near the lagoon mouth, erosional processes of the lagoonal islands and sediments supplied by the Antuã River. This work demonstrates that the available concentrations of rare earth elements can be considered as important tools for investigating sediment sources and dispersion in a coastal system. ...|$|R
