Brown and Damiani formed the [...] "new-wave influenced" [...] Deathray; their places within Cake were taken by Xan McCurdy and Gabe Nelson, whom McCrea persuaded to rejoin the band.|$|E
500|$|In July 1996, Radiohead started rehearsing and {{recording}} OK Computer in their Canned Applause studio, a converted shed near Didcot, Oxfordshire. Even without the deadline {{that contributed to}} the stress of The Bends, the band still had difficulties, which Selway blamed on their choice to self-produce: [...] "We're jumping from song to song, and when we started to run out of ideas, we'd move on to a new song... The <b>stupid</b> <b>thing</b> was that we were nearly finished when we'd move on, because so much work had gone into them." [...] The members worked with nearly equal roles in the production and formation of the music, though Yorke was still firmly [...] "the loudest voice" [...] according to O'Brien. Selway said [...] "we give each other an awful lot of space to develop our parts, {{but at the same time}} we are all very critical about what the other person is doing." [...] Godrich's role as co-producer was part collaborator, part managerial outsider. He said that Radiohead [...] "need to have another person outside their unit, especially when they're all playing together, to say when the take goes well... I take up slack when people aren't taking responsibility—the term producing a record means taking responsibility for the record... It's my job to ensure that they get the ideas across." [...] Godrich has produced every Radiohead album since, and has been characterised as Radiohead's [...] "sixth member", an allusion to George Martin's nickname as the [...] "fifth Beatle".|$|E

500|$|The Victorian all-rounder then top-scored with 123 {{and took}} a total of 4/48 in a nine-wicket win in the {{intervening}} county match against Middlesex at Lord’s, and he retained {{his place in the}} side for the Fourth Test at Leeds. Loxton was not involved in the second inning effort in which the Australians scored 3/404 on the final day, a world record for a successful Test run-chase, but he had taken three of the last four wickets in England’s first innings of 496 and scored a hard-hitting 93 in the first innings, putting on 105 in 95 minutes with Harvey. Their counterattacking partnership helped Australia to halt the English momentum after an early collapse; the score was still 4/189 when Loxton came in to bat. He was particularly severe on Jim Laker, lifting his off breaks into the crowd for four of his five sixes, mostly from lofted drives. With a maiden Test century beckoning, the Victorian swung wildly at a Norman Yardley ball and was bowled. In the dressing room, Sir Robert Menzies, a Prime Minister of Australia well known as a cricket-lover, upbraided him, saying [...] "That was a pretty <b>stupid</b> <b>thing</b> to do. You could have made a century", to which the fallen batsman retorted, [...] "Haven’t you made a few mistakes in your time, too?" [...] Nevertheless, Australia eventually proceeded from 6/329 at the time of Loxton’s departure to end on 458, almost nullifying the effect of England’s strong first innings total.|$|E

2500|$|Donald Tsang apologised for the government's bungled {{announcement}} of new political appointees, saying: [...] "With hindsight, I admit the arrangements {{in this regard}} did not fully meet public expectations, and I apologise for the controversy this has caused." [...] Tsang apologised for not having arranged for the new appointees to meet the public, whilst maintaining there were important points of principle to defend vis à vis the appointees' remuneration and nationalities. Reacting to criticism from Joseph Wong, he said [...] "...the most <b>stupid</b> <b>thing</b> is to have politics override law and {{to give up some}} principles for the sake of political convenience. In the long run, these are the biggest mistakes in politics and stupidity." [...] Tsang's apology was seen as 'grudging' and 'reluctant'.|$|E

He allowed officials to mislead the public. He hid the tapes because most likely he [...] assumed it would hurt his reelection campaign. Thus he {{not only did the}} immoral thing, he did the politically <b>stupid</b> <b>thing.</b> Cook County state's attorney Anita Alvarez probably would've quickly responded with an indictment—just like she did earlier this week, when the tape actually was released. I mean, it's really hard to look at that tape and not call for an indictment. If the mayor had done that, he wouldn't be the villain in this sordid story. He'd be the hero.

2500|$|On 11 June 2009 ex-communities {{secretary}} Hazel Blears, {{who chose}} to resign from the government just before the English county council and European elections, said that she regretted the timing of her decision. She also stated that her decision to wear a brooch with the words 'rocking the boat' {{on the same day}} as the resignation was a [...] "stupid thing to do". Speaking to the Manchester Evening News she said of the brooch [...] "It was a brooch my husband had given me. I'd had four weeks of intense media pressure, the like of which I have never known, not just on me but on my husband, my dad, my family. At that point I'd had enough. It was a <b>stupid</b> <b>thing</b> to do but I think it was just trying to put a brave face on—not going out cowed on the basis of expenses claims that genuinely are not true." ...|$|E
2500|$|I became {{terrified that}} I {{was going to}} be a full-time, bomb-throwing {{terrorist}} if I stayed [...] because it was the beginning of really bad times in America. It was '66–'67, it was the first police riot in Los Angeles.... In college my major was political science, so my brain worked that way.... And I drove around this little English Hillman Minx—top down—and every night I'd be hauled over by the cops. Up against the wall, and all this stuff. They had this monologue with me; it was never a dialogue. It was that I was a long-haired drug addict living off some rich guy's foolish daughter. And I said, [...] "No, I work in advertising. I make twice as much as you do." [...] Which is a <b>stupid</b> <b>thing</b> to say to a cop....And it was like an epiphany. I suddenly felt what it was like to be a black or Mexican kid living in L.A. Before that, I thought I knew what the world was like, I thought I knew what poor people were, and then suddenly it all changed because of that simple thing of being brutalized by cops. And I got more and more angry and I just felt, I've got to get out of here—I'm a better cartoonist than I am a bomb maker. That's why so much of the U.S. is still standing.|$|E

2500|$|Around 25 {{tracks were}} {{recorded}} for Guerrilla, with {{all members of}} the band agreeing to trim this number down for the final track listing of the record {{in order to make a}} 45-minute-long album which was immediate. The group chose the 'up' songs, the [...] "digital songs with more of a constant rhythm", that they had recorded and left off the 'down' tracks to create a positive [...] "brash and light-weight" [...] record—a [...] "disposable pop album that's too good to throw away". According to Bunford, some of the more guitar-orientated songs the group recorded were included on initial track listings and were only left off the record at the last minute in favour of more electronic sounding tracks. Rhys has said that the decision to include [...] "The Teacher" [...] on the album was a decisive moment, as the track is [...] "the most <b>stupid</b> <b>thing</b> on the record"—if a more downbeat song, such as eventual B-side [...] "The Matter of Time", had been included in its place, Guerrilla would have been a much more self-indulgent album. The singer has also stated that the group's [...] "healthy ego problems" [...] would often result in individuals fighting to have some of their own songs removed from the final track listing of the record in favour of songs written by other members. The band chose to sequence the album like a hip hop record, with [...] "Check It Out" [...] as an introduction and [...] "A Specific Ocean" [...] and [...] "The Sound of Life Today" [...] as interludes.|$|E
