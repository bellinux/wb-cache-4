40|$|Abstract. The {{quantitative}} {{relation between}} formula parameters of diamond segments and {{the properties of}} impregnated diamond <b>sawblade</b> is the weak point to the studying of <b>sawblade.</b> This paper just aims at it. In this paper, the quantitative relation between the diamond <b>sawblade</b> property and the formula parameter for making segments is obtained through strict theoretical calculations and inference. The following conclusions are reached:?. The conclusion coincides well with the related quantitative result, which indicates the feasibility of the study conclusion. ?. The quantitative relation between the <b>sawblade</b> performance and the formula parameters of segment {{can be used to}} guide the design of segment. ?. According to the formula parameters of segment, the performance of diamond <b>sawblade</b> can be foretold. ?. From the quantitative point of view, the relation between some formula parameters of segment and the performance of diamond <b>sawblade</b> will be discussed in the paper, and further research should be done to make sure of the inherent quantitative relation between all parameters formula of segment and the performance of diamond <b>sawblade...</b>|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{problems}} of the circular <b>sawblade</b> vibration. In the introductory part, theoretical bases are summarized to determine the form of vibrations and critical and resonant rotational frequency. A diagnostic method is proposed for the direct measurement of amplitudes of a circular <b>sawblade</b> by displacement sensors with the subsequent Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis. This method with the spectral analysis of a signal in the time area makes possible to determine {{the size and shape}} of vibration of a circular <b>sawblade</b> with respect to usability/applicability under operational conditions. Unlike standard methods, when the <b>sawblade</b> is excited by external sources, natural vibrations are used such as disk deformations and the dynamic unbalance of a circular <b>sawblade,</b> effects of chucking/gripping and machine vibration and, last but not least, the disk and sawn wood interaction...|$|R

50|$|Gladiator has no superhuman abilities. However, he is {{a superb}} martial arts fighter {{and is very}} {{physically}} powerful. He wore a thick metal armor with a helmet and metallic gauntlets, and was armed with an arsenal of edged weapons and whirling, jagged circular <b>sawblades</b> made of titanium steel, one mounted on each gauntlet. Small rotors in the gauntlets cause the blades to rotate at high speeds, and the whirling blades could also be detached to serve as short-range missile weapons.|$|E
50|$|Many {{gameplay}} {{elements from}} the previous games are reintroduced, along with new elements such as the Dropshot weapon that fires explosive drills and the Buzzkill that fires ricocheting <b>sawblades</b> at enemies. Players can also perform a short distance shoulder charge, knocking enemies off balance and enemies can also pull players out of cover and perform their own takedowns. The game features 4 categories of weather: from heavy breeze (trees, leaves, dust kicking up) and grow into violent category 3 windstorms that can affect combat and weapon usage.|$|E

5000|$|A two-man saw (known colloquially as a [...] "misery whip") is a saw {{designed}} for use by two sawyers. While some modern chainsaws are so large that they require two persons to control, two-man crosscut saws were primarily important when human power was used. Such a saw would typically be 4 to 12 ft long, and sometimes up to 16 ft, with a handle at each end. In some cases, such as when felling Giant Sequoias, <b>sawblades</b> could be brazed together end-to-end {{in order to create}} longer saws.|$|E
50|$|In 1970 Rutman {{founded the}} Central Maine Power Music Company (CMPMC) {{as his first}} {{ensemble}} to play these sculptures. The CMPMC included Rutman and Demby, with locals Hugh Robbins, Richie Slamm, and Sally Hilmer, plus hammer dulcimerist Dorothy Carter and other occasional guests playing Rutman and Demby's bowed sheet metal creations. Rutman's original concept for the group was to have it be made up entirely of handmade instruments, and the group did feature a configuration of circular <b>sawblades</b> used as percussion. But according to Rutman, his invented instruments ended up serving more as decorations for their performances, as {{the other members of}} the group brought in traditional eastern and western instruments, such as drums, electronic organ, flute, koto, saxophone, tamboura, and yang chin, as well as electronic musical novelties, including the Moog synthesizer and theremin.|$|E
50|$|The {{thing that}} {{separates}} this game from most shooters {{is that the}} weapons are not bullet-limited; they are time-limited. When someone picks up a weapon, that player can shoot {{it as much as}} they'd like until the timer runs out. There are a few different weapon-choices. The starting pistol is slow and weak, but it is really only a stand-in until a better weapon is found; The shotgun is the next weapon found, and it utilizes a powerful scatter shot; The Razor fires <b>sawblades</b> which bounce off of walls and wreak havok; The laser shoots slow bullets that travel through anyone they touch; And the Vulcan fires a quick, double stream of bullets. There are also secondary weapons such as landmines and rockets that allow for additional tactics.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Three {{kinds of}} typical {{concrete}} materials were tested involving cement concrete, steel fiber reinforced concrete and ferroconcrete. The 3 -direction cutting forces acted on the diamond <b>sawblade</b> were measured with varied cutting speed, feed speed, {{depth of cut}} and diamond segments. The measurements show that during the whole cutting process, the curve of cutting forces fluctuate intensely, which indicate the differences of the cutting process of heterogeneous mixture of the concrete. Because of the larger amplitude, the average values of cutting forces are much smaller than that of peak values. The cutting forces increase {{with the increase of}} feed speed, in reverse, decrease with the increasing of cutting speed. When the strength grades of the concrete materials are the same, the cutting forces of ferroconcrete and steel fiber reinforced concrete show the higher value than those of cement concrete. The cutting forces of <b>sawblade</b> with brone-cobalt based bond are greater than those of <b>sawblade</b> with cobalt based bond in sawing concrete process. Adding cobalt content in matrix, the cutting force can be decreased when sawing cement concrete. While sawing steel fiber concrete and ferroconcrete, the cutting forces can be decreased by reduction of cobalt content and increase of iron content in matrix...|$|R

5000|$|Wider {{material}} can be flat rolled with the rolls tilting {{such that the}} [...] "short" [...] edge is lengthened, with thickness slightly reduced, to equal the [...] "long" [...] edge. The material is then straight if properly processed. Several different types of these machines are available, ranging from position controlled to pressure controlled machines. Also, machines are available with automatic self checking features. If the material has residual stress as in toothed bandsaw blades, the rolls must not uniformly apply cross strain, as the inherent strain will distort the strip. In these cases, rolls exert corrective strain in a linear narrow strip inboard of the edge each side. In the case of <b>sawblades</b> with teeth on, the corrective squeezed strip on the toothed edge is located along the tooth gullet, and corrective squeeze on the toothed side must be about 2.5 times the corrective force on the plain edge.|$|E
50|$|Hordak and the Evil Horde {{originally}} {{appeared in}} the Filmation cartoon series She-Ra: Princess of Power. Hordak is portrayed as a ruthless tyrant, who delights in the pain and misery of others, including his own minions. He rules Etheria from his headquarters, the Fright Zone. He {{has the ability to}} transform all and/or parts of his body (usually his arm/s) into a wide variety of mechanical weapons and devices, including cannons, rockets, tanks, <b>sawblades,</b> drills and flamethrowers. His powers seem to be derived from a combination of magic and science. He has an older brother named Horde Prime, who is the evil ruler of the galaxy-spanning Horde Empire. Their home planet is known as Horde World. The Horde employs a vast army of robots, tanks, aircraft, spaceships and other advanced technology to allow them to conquer and enslave planets. An assortment of the most horrible creatures in the universe serve the Horde as the leaders of its robotic army.|$|E
5000|$|Melvin Potter is a {{recurring}} character in Daredevil, portrayed by Matt Gerald. He is a craftsman that tailors protective suits for Wilson Fisk and his associates. Designs for and components of his Gladiator costume from the comic books appear scattered around his workshop in various episodes. He fights with circular <b>sawblades,</b> albeit {{only as an}} improvised weapon as he throws them at Matt. His relationship with Betsy Beatty is hinted at, as he works exclusively for Fisk (and Fisk's allies) because Fisk has threatened to harm Betsy if Melvin does not comply or if anyone shows up that isn't in Fisk's company. He makes his introduction in the episode [...] "Shadows in the Glass," [...] when Fisk has him tailor a new suit for Leland Owlsley after Owlsley gets roughed up by Matt. When Matt learns about Melvin a few episodes later, and learns about Fisk's hold on him, he convinces Melvin to tailor him a red costume and promises to protect Betsy from being harmed by Fisk. By the season one finale, Melvin has finished his first suit, in time for Matt's takedown of Fisk. Melvin explains the design noting which areas of the armor are more protective against bullets and knives. In season 2, Melvin provides Matt with a new mask capable of withstanding gunfire after his old mask is damaged by a bullet during a confrontation with Frank Castle. When Matt shows up at Melvin's workshop in [...] "Penny and Dime" [...] {{to pick up the}} new helmet, Melvin is seen wearing a prototype version of his trademark Gladiator armor under his shirt. He asks Matt if {{he would like to see}} the full suit, though Matt politely declines. In the season 2 finale, Melvin gives Matt his trademark billy club with grappling hook capabilities. He also tailors a new uniform for Elektra before their final battle with the Hand.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. An {{investigation}} is reported of the {{temperatures in the}} sawing of granite with a circular <b>sawblade</b> under {{a wide range of}} machining parameters including cutting fluids and cutting modes. Temperature responses in the sawing contact zone were measured using a foil thermocouple. The measurement was subsequently used to analyze the influence of operating parameters on the sawing temperatures and the energy partition. For either down-cutting or up-cutting, either with cutting fluids or without cutting fluids, the temperatures in the sawing zone were found to increase with depth of cut, <b>sawblade</b> speed, and workpiece speed. The maximum temperature in the sawing without cutting fluids was found to be up to 400 °C whereas it was reduced to around 250 °C while using cutting fluids. The energy partition conducted to the workpiece is about 7 % ~ 10 % in dry sawing and about 2 % ~ 5 % in wet sawing...|$|R

40|$|The {{goal with}} this work, which extend {{over a period}} of 3 years, is to create a tool/tools that can help sawdoctors perform better. This thesis covers the first five months and was made year 1999 at Forest Research Institute, Rotorua New Zeeland. It {{contains}} of a Literature review, what features to measure and how this affect a <b>sawblades</b> performance, building and evaluating of the first prototypes. The thesis also include a test of a statistical method in order to measure every <b>sawblades</b> individual performance. Two prototypes were constructed which measure five features:* A video inspection system that measures every tooth individual side clearence angle and tip width. * A system for measuring a <b>sawblades</b> individual topography* Two systems for measuring <b>sawblades</b> tension (light gap and naturalfrequency). The video inspections system have a precision in measuring the side clearance angle of 0. 56 degree average standard deviation and tip width precision of 0. 14 mm average standard deviation. Better precision in measuring side clearance must be made and can be achived with higher resolution in camera and bigger monitor. First prototype aimed to measure a <b>sawblades</b> individual topography and tension at the same time. As a result the blade was mounted on a hub horizontally. Unfortunately result showed that <b>sawblades</b> topography became inconsistent. The sawblade has to be mounted vertically to prevent effects from gravity. A new prototype was constructed but could not be evaluated due to an accident when transporting the prototype to the mill. The tension was measured in two ways: by light gap method and measuring a blades natural frequency. Measuring the tension by its natural frequency was more of a test in order to determine if this could be an adequate method. An accelerometer was used to create a pulse into the blade. The evaluation showed that it was hard to tune in the right frequency which is crucial for a consistent result. One way to get around this problem would be to send a number a frequency in to the blade (pink noise) and record all naturalfrequencies. To eliminate effects of lumps the light gap method was performed on new <b>sawblades.</b> Each blade was mounted horizontally on a hub and fixed at a point in the rim. A bending force was performed {{on the opposite side of}} the fixed point and the light gap was measured on a 90 degree angle from the fixed point and the bending force. The result showed inconsistent readings. Up to 1. 92 mm difference in light gap on the same sawblade was measured. Next step is to perform the test again but now redesign the prototype so that the blade is being mounted vertically. A Mathematical method was created and tested which aimed to calculate <b>sawblades</b> individual performance by knowing the boards position in the saw and by measuring the boards thickness (variance) in a number of points. Result show negative variance on a number of <b>sawblades</b> which is mathematically impossible. The conclusion is therefore that this mathematical method for measuring the blades performance can not be made. Validerat; 20121112 (ysko...|$|E

40|$|We {{deal with}} the problem of {{vibration}} control of a silicon wafer slicing blade cutting a crystal ingot. Transverse vibration is detrimental to the cutting performance of the slicing ID <b>sawblade.</b> A feedback control scheme is introduced to suppress the vibration of the blade under lateral dynamic disturbance. The rotating <b>sawblade</b> is clamped at the outer boundary and stressed initially in the radial direction, while the inner periphery is subjected to both stationary in-plane and dynamic lateral slicing loads from the workpiece. Furthermore, the normal pneumatic forces controlled by the PD algorithm are applied to the blade to control the vibration. Numerical results are presented for an actual SUS 301 blade cutting a 6 "-diameter silicon ingot at 1550 rpm. The optimal positions of the sensors and the applied control forces are studied in detail. Results obtained show that the PD controller effectively suppresses the vibration and improves the flatness of the rotating slicing blade...|$|R
