5|$|Most {{mutations}} within {{genes are}} neutral, having {{no effect on}} the organism's phenotype (silent mutations). Some mutations do not change the amino acid sequence because multiple codons encode the same amino acid (synonymous mutations). Other mutations can be neutral if they lead to amino acid sequence changes, but the protein still functions similarly with the new amino acid (e.g. conservative mutations). Many mutations, however, are deleterious or even lethal, and are removed from populations by natural selection. Genetic disorders are the result of deleterious mutations and can be due to <b>spontaneous</b> <b>mutation</b> in the affected individual, or can be inherited. Finally, a small fraction of mutations are beneficial, improving the organism's fitness and are extremely important for evolution, since their directional selection leads to adaptive evolution.|$|E
25|$|These {{conditions}} are generally inherited, {{and the different}} muscular dystrophies follow various inheritance patterns. Muscular dystrophy can be inherited by individuals as an X-linked disorder, a recessive or dominant disorder. Furthermore, {{it can be a}} <b>spontaneous</b> <b>mutation</b> which means errors in the replication of DNA and spontaneous lesions. Spontaneous lesions are due to natural damage to DNA, where the most common are depurination and deamination.|$|E
25|$|Achondroplasia {{is caused}} by a {{mutation}} in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3). In normal development FGFR3 has a negative regulatory effect on bone growth. In achondroplasia, the mutated form of the receptor is constitutively active and this leads to severely shortened bones. The effect is genetically dominant, with one mutant copy of the FGFR3 gene being sufficient to cause achondroplasia, while two copies of the mutant gene are invariably fatal (recessive lethal) before or shortly after birth (known as a lethal allele). A person with achondroplasia thus has a 50% chance of passing dwarfism to each of their offspring. People with achondroplasia can be born to parents that do not have the condition due to <b>spontaneous</b> <b>mutation.</b>|$|E

Some children have <b>spontaneous</b> <b>mutations</b> (i.e. not present in either parent) which can cause developmental disorders including learning disabilities. One study estimated that about one in 300 children had such <b>spontaneous</b> <b>mutations,</b> for example a fault in the CDK13 gene which is associated {{with learning}} and communication difficulties in the children affected.|$|R
25|$|E. coli DNA adenine methyltransferase (Dam) is {{an enzyme}} of ~32 kDa {{that does not}} belong to a restriction/modification system. The target {{recognition}} sequence for E. coli Dam is GATC, as the methylation occurs at the N6 position of the adenine in this sequence (G meATC). The three base pairs flanking each side of this site also influence DNAâ€“Dam binding. Dam plays several key roles in bacterial processes, including mismatch repair, the timing of DNA replication, and gene expression. As a result of DNA replication, the status of GATC sites in the E. coli genome changes from fully methylated to hemimethylated. This is because adenine introduced into the new DNA strand is unmethylated. Re-methylation occurs within two to four seconds, during which time replication errors in the new strand are repaired. Methylation, or its absence, is the marker that allows the repair apparatus of the cell to differentiate between the template and nascent strands. It has been shown that altering Dam activity in bacteria results in increased <b>spontaneous</b> <b>mutation</b> rate. Bacterial viability is compromised in dam mutants that also lack certain other DNA repair enzymes, providing further evidence for the role of Dam in DNA repair.|$|E

500|$|Dominant {{white is}} a group of genetically related coat color {{conditions}} in the horse, best known for producing an all-white coat, but also for producing some forms of [...] white spotting and white markings. Dominant white horses are born with unpigmented pink skin and white hair with dark eyes, although the amount of white hair or spotting can vary depending on which genetic mutation is involved. Dominant white is a rare condition, and under normal conditions, at least one parent must be dominant white to produce dominant white offspring. [...] However, most of the currently-known alleles of dominant white can be linked to a documented <b>spontaneous</b> <b>mutation</b> in a single ancestor.|$|E

50|$|In each generation, {{the genetic}} {{variation}} within a population increases due to accumulation of mutations and decreases {{in response to}} natural selection and genetic drift. Mutation accumulation occurs when mutations of small effect accumulate at certain loci, yielding a large phenotypic effect in the aggregate. Multiple genes may simultaneously affect behavioural traits. <b>Spontaneous</b> <b>mutations</b> arise from sources including errors in DNA replication, spontaneous lesions, and transposable genetic elements {{in the absence of}} mutagens. <b>Spontaneous</b> <b>mutations</b> {{play a central role in}} the maintenance of genetic variation and persistence of natural population of many organisms.|$|R
5000|$|The {{frequency}} of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>mutations</b> is significantly lower in advanced male germ cells than in somatic cell types {{from the same}} individual. [...] Female germ cells also show a mutation frequency that is lower than that in corresponding somatic cells and {{similar to that in}} male germ cells. [...] These findings appear to reflect employment of more effective mechanisms to limit the initial occurrence of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>mutations</b> in germ cells than in somatic cells. Such mechanisms likely include elevated levels of DNA repair enzymes that ameliorate most potentially mutagenic DNA damages.|$|R
500|$|Dominant {{white is}} one of several {{potential}} genetic causes for horses with near-white or completely white coats; it may occur through <b>spontaneous</b> <b>mutation,</b> and thus may be found unexpectedly in any breed, even those that discourage excessive white markings. To date, dominant white has been identified in multiple families of Thoroughbreds, American Quarter Horses, [...] Frederiksborg horses, Icelandic horses, Shetland ponies, Franches Montagnes horses, South German Draft horses, and in one family of the Arabian horse. [...] The American White Horse, which is descended primarily from one dominant white stallion crossed on non-white mares, is known for its dominant white coat, as is the Camarillo White Horse.|$|E
2500|$|The genetic {{mutations}} responsible for splashed white are two found at MITF {{and one at}} PAX3. SW-1 is the MITFprom1 mutation, the most prevalent. It appears to be several hundred years old and predates the development of modern breeds. [...] SW-2 is a PAX3 mutation (PAX3C70Y) traced to a single Quarter Horse mare foaled in 1987 and {{is believed to be}} a <b>spontaneous</b> <b>mutation</b> beginning with that horse. SW-3, the MITFC280Sfs*20 mutation, has been seen in Quarter Horses but is very rare. Some horses of Quarter Horse lineage carry more than one splash mutation.|$|E
2500|$|DNA tests {{exist for}} three forms of splashed white, labeled SW-1, SW-2 and SW-3. SW-1 is thought have {{originated}} {{hundreds of years}} ago and today has been identified in the American Quarter Horse, American Paint Horse, Icelandic horse, Miniature horse, Morgan horse, Shetland pony and Trakehner. [...] SW-2 and SW-3 appear at present to be confined to certain lines of Quarter horses and Paints, with SW-3 being particularly rare. [...] A fourth allele of splash, informally called [...] "Macchiato", produced by the gene MITF:p.N310S has only been found in a single Franche-Montagne horse, probably a <b>spontaneous</b> <b>mutation,</b> and that individual was sterile.|$|E

2500|$|A white-eyed [...] "albino" [...] {{horn fly}} was {{discovered}} in a colony maintained at the Knipling-Bushland U.S. Livestock Insects Research Laboratory in Kerrville, Texas. This is apparently a <b>spontaneous</b> <b>mutation,</b> as tests including crosses were performed that determined the white-eye mutation was not sex-linked and the white-eyed flies actually have decreased amounts of eye pigment present within the head. This {{appears to be an}} inherited simple Mendelian autosomal recessive with complete penetrance. A colony of white-eyed horn flies was established from this single individual and has been maintained in the laboratory as visible genetic markers such as an eye color mutation in an economically important species like the horn fly may be useful for behavior and population dynamic studies, as well as release and recapture studies. No other differences from the wild-type flies were detected in the external characteristics of the mutant phenotype or in egg viability. However, white-eyed flies had significantly lower amounts of the pigment dihydroxyxanthommatin in their heads suggesting either the lack of xanthommatin production, or a failure of transport and storage within the head of the mutant phenotype.|$|E

40|$|We have {{investigated}} genetic interactions between <b>spontaneous</b> <b>mutations</b> affecting abdominal and sternopleural bristle number that have accumulated in 12 long-term selection lines derived from an inbred strain, and mutations at 14 candidate bristle number quantitative trait loci.

50|$|Clues to {{the first}} two {{questions}} come from studies that have shown that at least 30% of individuals with autism have <b>spontaneous</b> de novo <b>mutations</b> {{that occurred in the}} father's sperm or mother's egg and disrupt genes important for brain development, these <b>spontaneous</b> <b>mutations</b> likely cause autism in families where there is no family history. The concordance between identical twins isn't quite 100% for two reasons, because these mutations have variable 'expressivity' and their effects manifest differently due to chance effects, epigenetic, and environmental factors. Also <b>spontaneous</b> <b>mutations</b> can potentially occur specifically in one twin and not the other after conception. The likelihood of developing intellectual disability is dependent on the importance the effect the gene or mutation has on brain development, and also the genetic and environmental background upon which a mutation occurs.The recurrence of the same mutations in multiple individuals affected by autism has led Brandler and Sebat to suggest that the spectrum of autism is breaking up into quanta of many different genetic disorders.|$|R

40|$|The {{negative}} effect of permanent contamination of populations because of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>mutations</b> {{does not appear}} to be very high if judged from the relatively good health of humans or many wild and domesticated species. This is partly explained by the fact that, in diploids, the new mutations are usually located in heterozygous loci and therefore are masked by wild-type alleles. The expression of mutations at the phenotypic level may also strongly depend on environmental factors if, for example, deleterious alleles are more easily compensated under favorable conditions. The present experiment uses diploid strains of yeast in which mutations arise at high rates because a mismatch-repair protein is missing. This mutagenesis resulted in a number of new alleles that were in heterozygous loci. They had no detectable effect on fitness when the environment was benign. A very different outcome was seen when thermal shock was applied, where fitness of the mutation-contaminated clones was lower and more diverse than that of the nonmutagenized clones. This shows that the genetic load conferred by <b>spontaneous</b> <b>mutations</b> can be underestimated or even overlooked in favorable conditions. Therefore, genetic variation can be higher and natural selection more intense when environmental conditions are getting poorer. These conclusions apply, at least, to that component of variation that directly originates from <b>spontaneous</b> <b>mutations</b> (as opposed to the variation resulting from the history of selection) ...|$|R
