40|$|International audienceA wood pellet micro {{combined}} {{heat and}} power device (μCHP) {{has been tested}} in order to characterize its performances in steady and transient states. A dynamic model based on these experimental investigations has been developed in order to predict its energy performances and its pollutant emissions. The model is designed with a few parameters experimentally accessible. This model has been implemented in TRNSYS numerical environment. This work focuses on the experimental investigations and on the model description. The modelling approach is based on a physical part (an energy balance on the entire device and a combustion model), and on an empirical part (correlations for the fuel power input and for the thermal and electrical outputs). The model characterizes the μCHP behaviour for different part load ratios (PLR) (power modulation). The dynamic phases with <b>start-up</b> and <b>cooling</b> phases are also taken into account...|$|R
40|$|With {{their high}} {{electrochemical}} efficiency, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and solid oxide electrolyzers (SOEs) offer viable means of reducing energy sector {{greenhouse gas emissions}} and storing surplus renewably-generated power. At present, these systems have operating temperatures of over 600 [*]°C. During <b>start-up,</b> following <b>cooling</b> or in an emergency shut-off situation, a premixed safety gas is necessary which prevents damage to the cell's anode substrate. To date, safety gas has been industrially produced and stored in compressed gas cylinders. Given an SOFC system's size, these cylinders must be transported and stored in close proximity and replaced following gas expenditure. The storage space required, {{as well as the}} continuous replacement of gas cylinders, increases system size and costs. This paper presents a solution to this problem {{in the form of a}} specially developed safety gas generator that generates an on-demand synthetic safety gas via the system's infrastructure. The functionality of this component is experimentally validated in tests conducted with a 4 -cell stack...|$|R
40|$|PatentThis {{invention}} {{describes a}} new geometry for a heat driven thermo acoustic prime mover (i. e. acoustic motor) and {{its application to}} a thermo acoustic refrigerator and to an electricity generator. The heat driven acoustic refrigerator has no moving parts, and is thus extremely reliable, simple, and cheap to manufacture. Unlike previous heat driven acoustic cooling engines, it has good efficiency and compactness and is easy to start, avoiding destructively high temperatures upon <b>start-up.</b> The <b>cooling</b> engine is saleable over an extremely wide range of cooling capacities from integrated circuit and sensor cooling to building air-conditioning. The electricity generating engine has modest efficiency, but may be attractive in remote applications where high-reliability or low cost or low environmental noise or solar powering is important. The generator {{is likely to be}} most attractive in capacities of a few kW to below 100 W where a tiny engine would be impractical using other technologies...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{dynamic model}} for the {{simulation}} of gas micro {{combined heat and power}} devices (μCHP boilers) has been developed in order to assess their energy performances. From a literature review and experimental investigations, the new model is designed with the aim of limiting the number of parameters which need to be easily accessible in order to be suitable with annual building energy simulations. At first, this paper focuses on the description of the μCHP boiler which has been tested, {{on the development of the}} test bench and on the experimental results. Then, it focuses on the model description, on its parameterization and on its validation. The modelling approach is based on an energy balance on the device and on empirical expressions for the main inputs and outputs. The model characterizes the μCHP boiler behaviour for different inlet water flow rates and temperatures. The dynamic phases with the <b>start-up</b> and <b>cooling</b> phases are taken into account. Finally, the models for the Stirling engine and the additional boiler are limited respectively to 28 and 24. Further experimental investigations led to simplify the μCHP model from 28 to 17 parameters without reducing the accuracy...|$|R

Microtubuiar SOFCs have fowsed iarge {{attention}} in the recentyears, as they present good resistance to themal cycling (rapid <b>start-up</b> and <b>cooling</b> times). In addition, due to the easv sealing. they aiso possess superior durability in comparison wiih the tradtional planar geometry. Anode supported NiO-YSZ (yttria stabilized zirconia) microtubes were fabricated by extrusion. Ali the parameters (powder cornposition, pore formers, organic additives) were adjusted {{in order to obtain}} the desired green tubes. Subsequently, optimization, of the solvent and thermal debinding was also performed. YSZ electrolytes were deposited by dip-coating followed by cosinterization with the anode supoorts al 1450 ºC. Finally LSM (lanthanum strontium manganite) -YSZ catnodes were deposited by dip-coating and sintered at 1150 ºC. A typicai microstructure of the celi is shown in figure 1. Complete fuel cell characterization was performed. Results of current/power density-voltage curves, AC impedance spectroscopy, themal cycling and durability will be presented and discussed. ln addition, the reversibility oi the cells will be also analysed by studies of steam electroiysis.

40|$|A nominal 10. 6 kW (3 ton), vertical-configuration ground-coupled {{heat pump}} was {{installed}} in Abilene, Texas in December 1989 and was monitored until May 1993 using a remote data acquisition system. The unit {{was installed in}} the guest officer quarters at Dyes Air Force Base. Monitored data included: temperature and relative humidity of return and supply air, water temperature entering and leaving the condenser, power consumption of the individual system components, cycling rate, on-time, and soil temperatures at various depths and radial locations. Water and air flow rates were measured twice during the monitored period, and have remained constant. The measured quantities allow calculation of instantaneous capacity, power, coefficient of performance (COP), and ground-coil heat rejection. Data for operation in the cooling and heating mode are discussed here. Based on the experimental data, {{it was discovered that}} the water temperature entering the condenser (EWT) exhibited a prolonged minimum after <b>start-up</b> due to <b>cooling</b> of the water during the off-cycle when operating in the cooling mode. The decreased levels of EWT early in the cycle increased capacity and decreased power, both acting to increase the COP. Seasonal COPs for heating and cooling were estimated from the data and are presented...|$|R
40|$|Duct losses have a {{significant}} effect on the efficiency of delivering space cooling to U. S. homes. This effect is especially dramatic during peak demand periods where half of the cooling equipment's output can be wasted. Improving the efficiency of a duct system can save energy, but can also allow for downsizing of cooling equipment without sacrificing comfort conditions. Comfort, and hence occupant acceptability, is determined not only by steady-state temperatures, but by how long it takes to pull down the temperature during <b>cooling</b> <b>start-up,</b> such as when the occupants come home on a hot summer afternoon. Thus the delivered tons of cooling at the register during start-up conditions are critical to customer acceptance of equipment downsizing strategies. We have developed a simulation technique which takes into account such things as weather, heat-transfer (including hot attic conditions), airflow, duct tightness, duct location and insulation, and cooling equipment performance to determine the net tons of cooling delivered to occupied space. Capacity at the register has been developed as an improvement over equipment tonnage as a system sizing measure. We use this concept to demonstrate that improved ducts and better system installation is as important as equipment size, with analysis of pull-down capability as a proxy for comfort. The simulations indicate that an improved system installation including tight ducts can eliminate the need for almost a ton of rated equipment capacity in a typical new 2, 000 square foot house in Sacramento, California. Our results have also shown that a good duct system can reduce capacity requirements and still provide equivalent <b>cooling</b> at <b>start-up</b> and at peak conditions...|$|R
40|$|The Sherburne Generating Plant of the Northern States Power Company {{is located}} 40 miles NW of Minneapolis. Plant Units 1 and 2 {{were placed in}} service in 1976 and 1977. Proposed Units 3 and 4 of 800 Mw {{capacity}} each were scheduled for commercial operation in the early 1980 's. Proposed design improvements in the circulating cooling water systems. for Units 3 and 4 involved complex hydraulic flows. To assure performance, hydraulic model studies were undertaken. This report details the studies of a 1 : 12 model which were made at the St. Anthony Falls Hydraulic Laboratory. In normal operations, heated water from the condensers is elevated {{to the top of}} forced draft cooling towers where it is released to spray downward for <b>cooling.</b> <b>Start-up</b> during sub freezing weather could lead to damaging freeze-up in the cooling tower. An added 84 inch diameter temporary cold weather by-pass drops the 168, 000 gpm flow a distance of over 40 feet and requires a dispersed manifold port system assuring good energy dissipation and a stable, well-distributed flow into the tower basin. Based on initial model studies, several small changes were made in the original design to achieve the desired flow quality. Flow in the coaling system is maintained by two 5, 000 HP pumps drawing from a pump basin supplied by two cooling towers. The basin serves to route flow from either or both towers to either or both pumps. There was a concern that flow asymmetries or vortices detrimental to pump performance might be generated in the pump basin. Extensive tests at the model pump suction using pitots and vortex sensors establish that good flow conditions existed for all routings and no modification of the basin design was needed. Separate considerations were given to the influence of trash screens and fire water pumping and the dispersion of additive acid in the pump basin. Northern States Power Compan...|$|R
