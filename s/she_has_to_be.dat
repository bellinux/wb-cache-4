500|$|According to {{literary}} critic Mary Ellen Snodgrass, Irish Thoroughbred {{is not as}} polished as later Roberts works. [...] Snodgrass cites many predictable elements, including the core [...] "confrontation between an overconfident male and an assertive girl-woman". [...] Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, romance novel heroines were generally [...] "trembling virgins", of an inferior class and power level than the hero. The hero often was very rich and powerful, while the heroine worked in traditional, subordinate, female roles, such as governess or secretary. [...] The heroine of Irish Thoroughbred conformed to this pattern in part, by being sexually inexperienced, immature, and poor, but Roberts deliberately deviated {{from the rest of}} the stereotype by providing her with a hot-tempered and independent personality. [...] Her later books have continued in the same vein. [...] As Roberts explains, [...] "My heroine may have problems, she may be vulnerable, but <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> strong, <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> intelligent. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> independent and so does he, or I'm not interested in telling their stories." [...] The popularity of this book and Roberts's subsequent novels helped transform the genre, making authors more willing to give heroes and heroines economic and emotional parity.|$|E

Also according to Metcalfe, [...] "Every three months Mercedes has to have an HIV test and, yes, it is making her resent Malachy a bit. She can’t help wondering what it would be like to be with someone like Calvin who isn't HIV positive", even though she felt [...] "guilty". When Mercedes learned that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> retested for HIV, she feared that the test would be positive. Initially, she did not tell Malachy about it, but eventually [...] "snaps" [...] at him, telling him she [...] "won't forgive him" [...] if she has contracted HIV.

500|$|... "Teardrops on My Guitar" [...] has {{received}} generally favorable reviews from contemporary critics. [...] Regarding the song's musical genre, Roger Holland of PopMatters {{believed there was}} no reason for Swift to limit herself into only the country music or why she should be a country artist at all. Holland continued, [...] "Yet this is the channel to market she has chosen, and so <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> prepared to hear complaints about the way that trademarked Mutt Lange guitar whine has been married to her bright shiny pop songs in order to get them onto CMT, GAC, and country radio." [...] Bill Lamb of About.com rated [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar" [...] four out of five stars. Lamb complimented Swift's vocal delivery and songwriting style, but criticized the production and arrangement, perceiving them to be dull. He added that the track's refrains were most impacting and deemed it among the most memorable songs of 2007. Sean Dooley, also of About.com, described Swift's vocals as [...] "nothing less than captivating." ...|$|E

[...] Another time when asked whether Portman did all the dancing, he replied [...] "Not everything, {{but a lot of}} it. That shot, in the opening prologue when she walks off into the light and she’s flapping her wings, and she’s on pointe, that is 100%, untouched, no digital Natalie Portman.

[...] Dan confirmed Konuma's view by observing, [...] "My book editors often confuse S/M with cruelty and they want me to write some 'punishment tale' for them. This type of story is out of my realm. It just gives me the creeps. Rather, my concept of S/M is 'distorted sexual desire' or extreme disorientation. It's a male fantasy derived from love... from seeing a beauty suffer through the sense of shame. Therefore, my style contains a romantic, aesthetic, and sometimes decadent fragrance." [...] Konuma says of Dan's female characters, [...] "In his novels, he's searching for the beauty of women. He creates an ideal woman and proceeds to sell an S/M 'fantasy' to his readers." [...] According to Naomi Tani, Dan's perfect film actress must [...] "look good in a kimono; she needs to have long jet-black hair; she must have a certain amount of body fat, so that the bondage rope makes a clear impression on her skin; and <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> graceful under torture, with strong facial expressions." ...|$|E
