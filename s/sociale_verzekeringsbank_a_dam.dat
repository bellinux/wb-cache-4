50|$|<b>A</b> <b>dam</b> {{was first}} {{considered}} {{at the mouth}} of Rock Lake in the lake 1930s, and {{went so far as to}} install base columns. The idea of <b>a</b> <b>dam</b> was abandoned at this point because of the difficulty the topography would present. Recently, interest in building <b>a</b> <b>dam</b> at this site has been renewed. The Palouse-Rock Lake Conservation District is interested in having <b>a</b> <b>dam</b> built for the primary purpose of stabilize water supply to right-holders below the <b>dam</b> by creating <b>a</b> consistent flow throughout the year. The current plans for <b>a</b> <b>dam</b> would impound 110,000-120,000 acre feet of water.|$|R

40|$|The {{likelihood}} that <b>a</b> <b>dam</b> break would occur in Lule River {{is estimated to}} be very low, but the consequences would be significant if it would happen. The purpose of this thesis is to examine the need for information of the residents in Porjus and Boden, before and at the time of <b>a</b> possible <b>dam</b> break in Lule River. The specific questions addressed were: Do the residents want information and, if so, what kind of information do they want before and at the time of <b>a</b> <b>dam</b> break? In what way do the residents want to be informed at the time of <b>a</b> <b>dam</b> break? How high is the resident’s confidence in Vattenfall, the municipalities, the County Administration Board of Norrbotten, and media? Is it important for the residents whom information comes from before and at the time of <b>a</b> <b>dam</b> break? How do the residents judge the risks and the effects of <b>a</b> <b>dam</b> break? Are the residents worried that <b>a</b> <b>dam</b> break will occur? Is there a difference between genders or residents of each location? Does the responsibility of Vattenfall, the County Administration Board of Norrbotten, and the municipalities comply with the residents’ perception of what the authorities are responsible of in case of <b>a</b> <b>dam</b> failure? <b>A</b> questionnaire was sent out to randomly selected residents in Porjus and Boden. Telephone interviews were conducted with representatives for Vattenfall Vattenkraft AB and the municipalities of Gällivare, Jokkmokk, Boden, and Luleå. The results show that the residents wanted to know how much water there would be at <b>a</b> <b>dam</b> break, how much time they would have to evacuate, what areas would be affected, appropriate escape-routes, and where to go in case of <b>a</b> <b>dam</b> break. The residents had high confidence in Vattenfall Vattenkraft AB and the County Administration Board of Norrbotten, but a bit lower confidence in the municipalities. The majority of residents were not worried at all that <b>a</b> <b>dam</b> break would occur, except for some women in Boden. A large percentage of the residents were not prepared for <b>a</b> <b>dam</b> break and had none, or little control, over how they could protect themselves and their families. Differences between gender or residents of each location did not turn out as elements of importance in the study. The need of information varies between individuals and therefore are both short and more extensive information needed about an evacuation. Validerat; 20130204 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R
