This information is available in Victor C. Li's article on (ECC)- Tailored Composites through Micromechanical Modeling. http://www.engineeredcomposites.com/publications/csce_tailoredecc_98.pdf The first property listed, the ultimate tensile strength of 4.6 MPa, is slightly larger than the accepted tensile strength of standard fiber-reinforced concretes, (4.3 MPa). More notable, however, is the extremely high ultimate strain value of 5.6% when compared to most FRC's ultimate <b>strain</b> <b>values</b> ranging in the few hundredths of a percent.

40|$|International audienceThis work {{consists}} {{of determining the}} plastic <b>strain</b> <b>value</b> undergone by a material during a forming process using the instrumented indentation technique (IIT). A deep drawing steel DC 01 is characterized using tensile, shear and indentation tests. The plastic <b>strain</b> <b>value</b> undergone by this steel during uniaxial tensile tests is determined by indentation. The results show that, the identification from IIT doesn't lead to an accurate value of the plastic strain if {{the assumption that the}} hardening law follows Hollomon law is used. By using a F. E. method, it is shown that using a Voce hardening law improves significantly the identification of the hardening law of a pre-deformed material. Using this type of hardening law coupled to a methodology based on the IIT leads to an accurate determination of the hardening law of a pre-deformed material. Consequently, this will allow determining the plastic <b>strain</b> <b>value</b> and the springback elastic <b>strain</b> <b>value</b> of a material after a mechanical forming operation...|$|R

Citing that hardening and subsequent breakage will limit forming of the aluminum alloy below 460 C, the best flow behavior was observed at 550 C. This is significantly higher than the capabilities of warm liquid or warm gas pressure forming.

30|$|Electric power {{generation}} characteristics of {{lead zirconate titanate}} (PZT) piezoelectric ceramic have been examined during cyclic loading with different compressive <b>strain</b> <b>value.</b> A thin PZT ceramic plate attached to a thin brass plate was used. With an increasing compressive <b>strain</b> <b>value</b> in the PZT ceramic plate, the electric voltage increased, and the highest electric voltage was obtained for the sample with the high strain level (0.4 %). The electric voltage decreased for the sample with more than 0.45 % strain because of the failure in the PZT ceramic. The electric voltage was different depending on the strain condition, where the higher strain and the wider strain range (Δε) made the high electric voltage. Moreover, the electric voltage was attributed to the strain rate, where the higher strain rate made higher electric voltage due to high kinetic energy. The electric generation characteristics could be estimated with an operation of the <b>strain</b> <b>value</b> and <b>strain</b> ratio (εmin/εmax) especially for the sample loaded cyclically under the slow loading speed. This was affected by the linear correlation between the electric voltage and the <b>strain</b> <b>value.</b> Based upon the experimental work, suitable loading condition to make high electric voltage could be proposed.|$|R

50|$|The method tracks {{independently}} of the beam directions, and can thus track in two dimensions. It is also said to be independent of the angle error inherent in the Doppler algorithm. However, as the radial resolution (along the beam) is far better than the lateral resolution which also decreases with depth, both the angle independence and the tracking ability across the sector is lower. Also, instead of angle independency, the resulting <b>strain</b> <b>values</b> are dependent on the ROI (Region Of Interest) size and shape. Finally, {{in order to achieve}} tracking quality, the values are in most commercial applications smoothed by a spline smoothing function along the ROI, so the regional measurements are not pure regional, but rather to a degree, spline functions of the global average. In addition, the method has a lower sampling rate due to the limited frame rate of B-mode, which reduces tracking validity, especially at high heart rates.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} obtain a full forming limit curve, test pieces with {{different}} geometries are drawn by a punch (e. g. with a diameter of 100 mm) until fracture occurs. Friction is almost zero by using a complex tribo-system with foils and grease between sheet and tool. By use of an optical strain measurement system spatial strain paths areevaluated immediately before failure of the test piece. Using an interpolation method for the strain variation between the severely deformed and necked area - the limits of this area are computed by a sign change of the second derivative of the strain distribution - the major and minor <b>strain</b> <b>values</b> are obtained. Using an averaged value for several cross-section evaluations and 3 test samples for the same geometry a strain pair (one point in the forming limit diagram) as forming limit is identified.It is recognized by some authors {{that the nature of}} fracture and formability is intrinsically non-deterministic, since large variations might be observed even within a single experimental campaign. Therefore, the concepts of Forming Limit Bands and Forming Limit Maps have been introduced.|$|E
50|$|One main {{failure mode}} {{is caused by}} tearing of the material. This is typical for sheet-forming applications.A neck may appear at a certain forming stage. This is an {{indication}} of localized plastic deformation. Whereas more or less homogeneous deformation takes place in and around the subsequent neck location in the early stable deformation stage, almost all deformation is concentrated in the neck zone during the quasi-stable and instable deformation phase. This leads to material failure manifested by tearing. Forming-limit curves depict the extreme, but still possible, deformation which a sheet material may undergo during any stage of the stamping process. These limits depend on the deformation mode and the ratio of the surface strains. The major surface strain has a minimum value when plane strain deformation occurs, which means that the corresponding minor surface strain is zero. Forming limits are a specific material property. Typical plane <b>strain</b> <b>values</b> range from 10% for high-strength grades and 50% or above for mild-strength materials and those with very good formability.Forming limit diagrams are often used to graphically or mathematically represent formability. It is recognized by many authors that the nature of fracture and therefore the Forming limit diagrams are intrinsically non-deterministic, since large variations might be observed even within a single experimental campaign.|$|E

Rolling load {{was applied to the}} porcine articular cartilage samples with rectangular notches of different depths.

The <b>strain</b> <b>value</b> and peak frequency around the notch increased; the maximum equivalent <b>strain</b> <b>value</b> could be observed at both bottom corners of the notch; the equivalent <b>strain</b> <b>value</b> first increased and then decreased at the points in the superficial and middle layers with the increase of rolling velocity; the points in the deep layer were less affected by rolling velocity; the equivalent <b>strain</b> <b>value</b> of the points in the superficial layer declined after rising with the increase of defect depth, while a decreased trend could be found for the points in the middle and deep layers. Conclusions. The shear strain, which rose with the increase in defect depth, was the main factor in cartilage destruction. The cartilage tended to be destructed firstly at the bottom corner of the defect. Rolling velocity showed significant effects on superficial and middle layers.

In this paper, we report on our study of jacket effect to distributed Brillouin sensor system on strain measurement accuracy for constant load stretching and constant length stretching using the 900 m m tight-buffered fiber (Type-A) and the 250 m m optical fiber (Type-B).

The RRMSE of the mean grain diameter obtained via the proposed CA model simulation is 0.118.
