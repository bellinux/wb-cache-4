5|$|Due {{to their}} {{frequent}} relocation, Kaif and her siblings were home-schooled {{by a series}} of tutors. Although she is thought to have grown up in London, she lived there for only three years before moving to India. According to Kaif, she then changed her surname to her father's because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be easier to pronounce.|$|E
5|$|Gillian Jacobs as Britta Perry – Britta {{dropped out}} of high school because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> impress Radiohead. She then joined a group of anarchists who vandalized billboards. She has been in the Peace Corps, and done foot {{modeling}} before she enrolled at Greendale. She is strongly concerned with honesty, and does not take lightly to anyone lying to her.|$|E
25|$|In late 2001, Chara {{released}} {{music as}} the drummer of the twin-drum all-girl rock band, Mean Machine, alongside Yuki, Swallowtail actress Ayumi Ito, 1980s musician Mayumi Chiwaki and former funk/rock band Jagatara dancer Yukarie. The band was conceived in 1998, when Chiwaki mentioned to Chara that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{be good to}} start up a girls' rock band. One of the tenets of the band was that all members {{would have to do}} something they'd never tried before, landing Chara on drums. The band first practiced in 1999, and continued to sporadically practice throughout 2000, despite different members' schedules.|$|E

50|$|At first, Tavernier {{wanted to}} direct a {{different}} film. He {{wanted to make a}} film that was based on his daughter Tiffany's novel Dans la nuit aussi le ciel. Tiffany didn't want him to direct <b>it</b> because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be too difficult. Tiffany later ended up proposing Holy Lola to her father and wrote the screenplay.|$|R
25|$|Perpetrators Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson {{were arrested}} {{shortly after the}} attack and charged with first degree murder {{following}} Shepard's death. Significant media coverage {{was given to the}} killing and what role Shepard's sexual orientation played as a motive in the commission of the crime. The prosecutor argued that McKinney's murder of Shepard was premeditated and driven by greed. McKinney's defense counsel countered that he had only intended to rob Shepard, but had killed him in a rage when Shepard made a sexual advance towards him. McKinney's girlfriend told police that he had been motivated by anti-gay sentiment, but later recanted her statement, saying that she had lied because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> help him. Both McKinney and Henderson were convicted of the murder and each sentenced to two consecutive life sentences.|$|E
500|$|Lhermitte and Moqadem {{married on}} September 22, 1990, {{and moved into}} the {{apartment}} of Dr. Michel Schaar, a physician, with whom Moqadem was residing. Schaar had befriended Moqadem's family in Morocco in the 1980s and served as the young man's host in Belgium, and Moqadem considered Schaar as an adoptive father. While Moqadem worked at a convenience store, it was Schaar that was the primary financial provider. [...] Lhermitte did not object to living with Schaar in his apartment as <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be on a temporary basis.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} a song specifically written for Jenkins, titled [...] "Abigail's Song". In the script {{it was written}} that the song was unique and specific to Doctor Who, and composer Murray Gold was contacted to write the song. Jenkins did a demo and then sang the song while filming the actual scene, as <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> look more natural. Afterwards she sang the final version and new, lighter arrangement was composed by the National Orchestra of Wales. Selected pieces of music from this special, as composed by Gold, were released on [...] 21 March 2011 by Silva Screen Records.|$|E
5000|$|McGrady {{became a}} fan of Holby City {{while she was in}} a {{relationship}} with fellow actor Jalaal Hartley, who played Tom O'Dowd in the show from 2008 to 2009. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> [...] "a brilliant gig" [...] if she was cast in a role. When the character of Mary-Claire came up, McGrady knew she had to have the part.|$|R
6000|$|Roberts: [...] "Nonsense! Agnes {{knows all}} about it. She brought me the {{decanter}} herself. <b>She</b> and Amy <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> freshen me up. But I distrusted it; I was afraid the effect would be soporific--" ...|$|R

500|$|Blane {{was amazed}} by the {{recreation}} and understanding of her designs by fans. When she first heard that people were dressing up, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be tacky, but {{was surprised to see}} the depth to which the fans went to recreate her designs. Rocky Horror fan Mina Credeur, who designs costumes and performed as Columbia for Houston’s performance group, states that [...] "the best part is when everyone leaves with a big smile on their face", noting that there's [...] "such a kitschiness and campiness that it seems to be winking at you". The film still plays at many theatre locations and Rocky Horror costumes are often made for Halloween, although many require much time and effort to make.|$|E
500|$|The casting of Griet was Webber's {{first major}} step, {{and led to}} {{interviews}} with 150 girls before Webber chose the 17-year-old actress Scarlett Johansson. He felt that she [...] "... just stood out. She had something distinctive about her." [...] Johansson seemed very modern to Webber, but he believed this was a positive attribute, realising [...] "... that what would work was to take this intelligent, zippy girl and repress all that." [...] The actress finished filming Lost in Translation immediately before arriving on set in Luxembourg, and consequently prepared little for the role. She considered the script [...] "beautifully written" [...] and the character [...] "very touching", but did not read the book because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be better to approach the story with a [...] "clean slate." ...|$|E
500|$|Monthly teen {{magazine}} Seventeen called Purr's bottle design [...] "cute". Miriam Lacey of Popsugar's spin-off website BellaSugar {{gave the}} perfume a favorable review {{and said it}} smelt [...] "like a fancier, less chemical-laden version" [...] of fruit-scented body sprays. In her review, Lacey also called Purr an [...] "upside-down" [...] fragrance, because unlike most perfumes which [...] "open with their prettiest notes and then end with a relatively generic bottom accord", Purr has a [...] "really nice caramel and sweet patchouli dry down that fans of Angel will adore, but to get there, you have to sit through a bunch of fruity opening notes". Lacey observed that its scent only lasted about 2 hours; <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be better to spray it onto your hairbrush, [...] "since the oils on your scalp will help it last longer".|$|E
5000|$|The {{album cover}} {{features}} artwork by Nor Ashraf, a Malaysian artist that the band met over the internet. Numsuwankijkul said that once she'd seen <b>it</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{always be the}} album cover. She also said she {{sees it as a}} follow up to the [...] "Ribbons" [...] cover, taken by Koen Jacobs of a Ram who had just finished drinking some water.|$|R

5000|$|The {{inspiration}} for writing the poem Alabama came to Julia Tutwiler after {{she returned to}} her native state from Germany, where she had been studying new educational methods for girls and women. She recalled that in Germany patriotism was inspired by spirited songs. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be helpful toward restoring the spirits of her own people to give them a new patriotic song, inspiring her to write [...] "Alabama." ...|$|R
500|$|Not all reviews, however, were negative. Sarah Stegall of SF Scope {{gave the}} pilot a decent review, {{and said that}} if Moonlight could survive [...] "the Friday night time slot" [...] and the [...] "thwarted {{expectations}} of [...] fans who were expecting Blade", <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> [...] "rock". Kara Howland of TV Guide gave the pilot a positive review, {{and thought it was}} a [...] "solid start". Several critics praised Jason Dohring's portrayal of Josef. One said that he gave the pilot [...] "a small burst of energy", while another said that he made it [...] "crackle with a bit of wit". Dohring was described as [...] "a welcome presence", and one critic wished for [...] "a bit more screen time". Travis Fickett of IGN praised the action scenes, and noted, [...] "once the action gets started, it plays well".|$|E
500|$|In another instance, a scene {{called for}} Garland {{to exit the}} saloon, jump on a horse, and ride out of town. When the scene was shot, Garland jumped over the horse instead of on it, so the scene had to be shot again. During the second take, she twisted her ankle running down the stairs in the saloon, but {{continued}} the scene. When Garland returned home, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> feel good to put her ankle in a warm bath and did. She left it there for about an hour, but when she took it out, she found that it had swollen to twice its normal size. When {{she returned to the}} set, Corman said, [...] "Well, we have to start shooting." [...] In order to fit her ankle into her boot, the crew cut the back of it and taped it to her foot. Garland was unable to walk for nearly a week after Gunslinger finished shooting, writing that [...] "I had screwed up my ankle so bad!" ...|$|E
500|$|After 326 performances, Leigh {{finished}} her run, {{and she was}} soon assigned to reprise her role as Blanche DuBois in {{the film version of}} the play. Her irreverent and often bawdy sense of humour allowed her to establish a rapport with Brando, but she had an initial difficulty in working with director Elia Kazan, who was displeased with the direction that Olivier had taken in shaping the character of Blanche. Kazan had favoured Jessica Tandy and later, Olivia de Havilland over Leigh, but knew she had been a success on the London stage as Blanche. He later commented that he did not hold her in high regard as an actress, believing that [...] "she had a small talent." [...] As work progressed, however, he became [...] "full of admiration" [...] for [...] "the greatest determination to excel of any actress I've known. She'd have crawled over broken glass if <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> help her performance." [...] Leigh found the role gruelling and commented to the Los Angeles Times, [...] "I had nine months in the theatre of Blanche DuBois. Now she's in command of me." [...] Olivier accompanied her to Hollywood where he was to co-star with Jennifer Jones in William Wyler's Carrie (1952).|$|E
60|$|In {{answer to}} this Mary wrote to him {{to say that she}} would {{certainly}} see him when he came. She knew no reason, she said, why they should not meet. When she had written her note she asked her aunt's opinion. Aunt Sarah would not take upon herself to say that no such meeting ought to take place, but it was very evident that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be dangerous.|$|R
60|$|Amabel was {{especially}} pleased {{to stay a}} little longer {{on the banks of}} the lake, and to trace out more of Lucia's haunts; and if <b>she</b> secretly <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have been pleasanter without a third person, she was gratified to see how much Guy's manner had softened Philip's injustice and distrust, making everything so smooth and satisfactory, that at the end of the day, she told her husband that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> his experiment had not failed.|$|R
60|$|She stopped, and Cartwright noted her {{wandering}} glance that {{searched the}} beach and {{the path to the}} hotel. He knew whom <b>she</b> expected, and <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> give her some satisfaction to quarrel with the fellow. Cartwright did not mean to soothe her.|$|R
500|$|... "I See You" [...] {{was written}} by James Horner and Kuk Harrell and {{produced}} by Simon Franglen as the official theme song to James Cameron's 2009 film, Avatar. It {{is the second time}} that Horner and Franglen have collaborated on a theme song for a film directed by Cameron, the first being [...] "My Heart Will Go On", performed by Celine Dion and used for his 1997 film Titanic. In an interview with Rick Edwards for 4Music called Under the Skin of Leona Lewis, Lewis explained how she became involved with Avatar and recording the theme tune. The singer said that she had known about the project for some period of time as she is very interested in film in general, and that she was approached by Cameron to record Avatars official theme song. She continued to say that she was very excited about seeing the film, even before her involvement with the film came to be. Cameron invited Lewis to listen to what they had in mind for the song, and upon hearing it, she [...] "immediately wanted to be on board." [...] One of the reasons Lewis gave as to why she accepted the proposal was that a lot of her second studio album, Echo (2009), was inspired by various films, and <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be a great opportunity to appear on a soundtrack.|$|E
500|$|Beastie Boys {{were signed}} as the opening act for the tour. Adam [...] "MCA" [...] Yauch {{of the group}} recollected: [...] "One day, Russell Simmons, co-founder of Def Jam Recordings, came in and said, 'Hey guess what—Madonna's manager called. Do {{you guys want to}} go on tour with her?" [...] DeMann had asked for another group called The Fat Boys, but Simmons did not manage them and lied, saying [...] "Oh, the Fat Boys have another gig that week. What about Run–D.M.C.?" [...] But they were too {{expensive}} according to DeMann, and hence ultimately Beastie Boys were chosen. Adam [...] "Ad-Rock" [...] Horovitz from the band commented: [...] "It's not like any of us knew Madonna that much, but we all used to hang out at Dancetaria [...] so we knew about each other. I don't know why <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be a good idea , though. It was a terrible idea. But it was great for her in a way because we were so awful that by the time she came onstage, the audience had to be happy." [...] The circular stage for the tour, consisted of three ramps around the perimeter, which were connected with each other. A long line of stairs descended to the main stage from the central ramp; it was flanked by the band. About 30 feet above the stage, the speakers were suspended from a circular beam. Four giant screens lined the outer perimeter of the stage, on three sides.|$|E
2500|$|Consequently, {{to prepare}} for her role, Swank {{underwent}} extensive training in the ring and weight room gaining 19 pounds of muscle, aided by professional trainer Grant L Roberts. [...] She trained for nearly five hours every day, winding up with a potentially life-threatening staphylococcus infection. [...] She did not tell Eastwood about the infection because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be {{out of character for}} Maggie.|$|E
60|$|He was rapid in his utterance, and {{so full of}} energy, that Miss Mackenzie did {{not quite}} follow him in his quick transitions. She hardly {{understood}} whether he was advising her to take up an abode in a terrestrial Eden or a celestial Paradise; but she presumed that he meant to be civil, so she thanked him and said <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>would.</b> <b>It</b> was a thousand pities that he should squint so frightfully, as in all other respects he was a good-looking man. Just at this moment {{there seemed to be}} a sudden breaking up of the party.|$|R
5000|$|During {{her time}} in the show, it was hinted that Eddi liked to drink. Potts pointed out that {{drinking}} did {{appear to be the}} only way Eddi could deal with her many issues. Potts hoped the storyline would explored further, especially as Eddi's mother was an alcoholic. <b>She</b> also <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be fun to see Eddi lose her grip. Potts added that studies had shown people with alcoholics in their families became predisposed to it themselves.|$|R
60|$|Nothing but {{resolution}} {{on her own}} part could bring about a meeting, and she was resolute. She stormed the castle in person, and told Averil she must speak to Leonard. Ave was on her side now, and answered with {{tears in her eyes}} that she should be most grateful to have Leonard persuaded out of this dreadful plan, and put in the way of excelling as he ought to do; <b>she</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> come to this.|$|R

How often had <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{be good to}} be married to Daniel Thwaite and to have done with this weary searching after rank! And now what could her mother mean? Thomas Thwaite had been there, but it was {{impossible}} that her mother should think that Daniel Thwaite would be a fit husband for her daughter.
