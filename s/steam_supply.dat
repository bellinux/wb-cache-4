25|$|Watt's next {{improvement}} to the Newcomen {{design was}} {{to seal the}} top of the cylinder and surround the cylinder with a jacket. Steam was passed through the jacket before being admitted below the piston, keeping the piston and cylinder warm to prevent condensation within it. The second improvement was the utilisation of steam expansion against the vacuum {{on the other side of}} the piston. The <b>steam</b> <b>supply</b> was cut during the stroke, and the steam expanded against the vacuum on the other side. This increased the efficiency of the engine, but also created a variable torque on the shaft which was undesirable for many applications, in particular pumping. Watt therefore limited the expansion to a ratio of 1:2 (i.e. the <b>steam</b> <b>supply</b> was cut at half stroke). This increased the theoretical efficiency from 6.4% to 10.6%, with only a small variation in piston pressure. Watt did not use high pressure steam because of safety concerns.|$|E
25|$|The first {{water supply}} by {{distillation}} of boiler steam appeared on early paddle steamers {{and used a}} simple iron box in the paddle boxes, cooled by water splash. A <b>steam</b> <b>supply</b> direct from the boiler, avoiding the engine and its lubricants, was led to them. With the development of steam heating jackets around the cylinders of engines such as the trunk engine, the exhaust from this source, again unlubricated, could be condensed.|$|E

25|$|The nuclear <b>steam</b> <b>supply</b> {{for each}} unit was {{designed}} and supplied by Combustion Engineering, designated the System 80 standard design–a predecessor of the newer standard System 80+ design. Each primary system originally supplied 3.817GW of thermal power to the secondary (steam) side of each plant. The design is a so-called 2×4, with each of four main reactor coolant pumps circulating more than 111,000 gallons per minute of primary-side water through 2 large steam generators.|$|E
25|$|Incineration {{plants can}} {{generate}} {{electricity and heat}} that can substitute power plants powered by other fuels at the regional electric and district heating grid, and <b>steam</b> <b>supply</b> for industrial customers. Incinerators and other waste-to-energy plants generate at least partially biomass-based renewable energy that offsets greenhouse gas pollution from coal-, oil- and gas-fired power plants. The E.U. considers energy generated from biogenic waste (waste with biological origin) by incinerators as non-fossil renewable energy under its emissions caps. These greenhouse gas reductions are {{in addition to those}} generated by the avoidance of landfill methane.|$|E
25|$|As {{speeds and}} {{distances}} increased, mechanisms were developed that injected thick mineral {{oil into the}} <b>steam</b> <b>supply.</b> The first, a displacement lubricator, mounted in the cab, uses a controlled stream of steam condensing into a sealed container of oil. Water from the condensed steam displaces the oil into pipes. The apparatus is usually fitted with sight-glasses to confirm the rate of supply. A later method uses a mechanical pump worked {{from one of the}} crossheads. In both cases, the supply of oil is proportional to the speed of the locomotive.|$|E

25|$|In {{the age of}} steam, {{the steam}} calliope was {{particularly}} used on riverboats and in circuses. In both cases, a <b>steam</b> <b>supply</b> was already available for other purposes. Riverboats supplied steam from their propulsion boilers. Circus calliopes were sometimes installed in steam-drive carousels, or supplied with steam from a traction engine. The traction engine could also supply electric power for lighting, and tow the calliope in the circus parade, where it traditionally came last. Other circus calliopes were self-contained, mounted on a carved, painted and gilded wagon pulled by horses, but {{the presence of other}} steam boilers in the circus meant that fuel and expertise to run the boiler were readily available. Steam instruments often had keyboards made from brass. This was in part to resist the heat and moisture of the steam, but also for the golden shine of the highly polished keys.|$|E
2500|$|Early railway coaches had no heating but {{passengers}} could hire foot-warmers. [...] These {{worked on}} the same principle a modern sodium acetate heating pads. [...] Later, steam heating was introduced, using a <b>steam</b> <b>supply</b> from the steam locomotive. [...] Steam heating continued into the diesel locomotive era, with steam supplied by a steam generator. [...] Now, electric heating is almost universal and air-conditioning is often provided as well. [...] In the case of diesel multiple units, the coaches may be heated by waste heat from the engines, as in an automobile.|$|E
2500|$|Plans to {{electrify}} the railway using hydro-electric power, were considered in March 1920, but rejected as being uneconomic. Holdsworth, dating from 1866, {{was thought to}} be too heavy for the line, but when no buyers could be found, it was used as a stationary <b>steam</b> <b>supply</b> for a further 14 years. There were plans to overhaul Milner, to obtain another lighter engine, and to purchase two railmotor cars. From August 1920, work was carried out to improve the line between Lofthouse and Angram. This included easing the alignment on many of the curves, the addition of loops near Lofthouse and at Woodale, just below the Scar House site, and the construction of a [...] tunnel at Goydin Pot, which was used by up trains only. The line at Angram was extended to a small quarry in 1921, along the trackbed of Best's [...] gauge line beyond the dam. Stone was extracted for remedial work, caused by wind and wave erosion of the southern bank of the reservoir near the dam.|$|E
