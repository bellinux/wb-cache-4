50|$|The Hawaiian sling {{has some}} {{similarities}} to spearguns and polespears, in that all are powered by energy stored in rubber tubing. However, it occupies {{a middle ground}} between the two; the sling is somewhat more powerful than a polespear and offers a much more comfortable grip, but is less powerful than most <b>spear</b> <b>guns.</b> Like a pole spear, the diver must exert force on the shaft {{to keep it from}} releasing, whereas a <b>spear</b> <b>gun</b> has a trigger mechanism to accomplish this. Hawaiian slings are especially popular among divers who want a more challenging hunt, or those operating in areas where triggered spearguns are banned, such as the Bahamas, and Okinawa, Japan.|$|R
40|$|Fish flight {{initiation}} distance (FID) {{is emerging}} as a useful metric of the response of fishes to fishing, with significant differences in FID demonstrated between fished and no-take marine reserves. However, studies investigating FID vary in methodology, {{and many of the}} potential confounding effects inherent to in-water estimation of FID have yet to be investigated. Here we examined relative effects of <b>spear</b> <b>guns,</b> dive gear, observer bias and protection status on FID estimates. Three observers estimated FID of parrot fishes in both a fished area and a no-take marine reserve, via both SCUBA and free-diving, and with and without a simulated <b>spear</b> <b>gun</b> (8 treatments). We found that FID was significantly influenced by protection status, increasing by 141 cm on average in the fished area compared to the no-take marine reserve, but not by dive type or <b>spear</b> <b>gun</b> presence. While there were some differences between observers' mean estimate of FID, {{there was no evidence of}} observer bias, nor were there any significant differences in the precision of FID estimates between observers. Overall, management status explained almost 60 % of the variation in FID estimates, while observers accounted for only 4 %...|$|R

40|$|Fish {{landings}} in Malalison Island in {{the west}} central Philippines were monitored from February 1991 to January 1992 to determine the types of fishing gear employed, the predominant species caught, the catch per unit effort (CPUE), and the yield from the coral reefs. Fishing was monitored only during the spring tide periods, after a preliminary sampling showed no significant differences among four lunar phases. A total of 494 fishing operations was recorded. CPUE (kg per fisher h âˆ’ 1) by gear was 1. 1 for <b>spear</b> <b>guns,</b> 1. 4 for <b>spear</b> <b>guns</b> with compressor, 0. 4 for set gill nets, 2. 4 for drive-in gill nets, 1. 2 for drift gill nets, and 0. 7 for hook-and-lines. The CPUEs of Malalison gears {{are similar to those}} of other coral reef fisheries. Dominant species caught were fusiliers and surgeonfishes by gill net. surgeonfishes by <b>spear</b> <b>gun,</b> and snappers and groupers by hook-and-line. The fish yield from the Malalison coral reefs was estimated to be 5. 8 t km âˆ’ 2 year âˆ’ 1, which is low, and similar to overexploited. reefs in the Philippines and elsewhere. Live coral cover averages 35 % in Malalison. Reef degradation, high fishing effort, low yields, and the poverty of the fishing community suggest â€˜Malthusian over-fishingâ€™. Community based management and resource enhancement are being initiated by the SEAF-DEC Aquaculture Department to protect and sustain the fishery and improve the economy in Malalison Island...|$|R

40|$|This study {{tested the}} {{efficiency}} of an underwater biopsy probe designed to remove tissue samples for molecular analysis from small- to medium-sized (15 to 70 cm) marine teleost fish in the field. The probe was fired at lower and higher power from a 76 cm rubber-propelled <b>spear</b> <b>gun.</b> Two species were targeted: Plectropomus maculatus and Lutjanus carponotatus. The results were highly successful for P. maculatus, with > 80 % of hits at lower and higher power resulting in sufficient tissue extraction for molecular analysis. The results were less consistent for L. carponotatus at lower power (45 %) due to the relatively large scales of the fish. At higher power the success rate increased to 73 %. In 97 % of cases, fish swam away rapidly with only minor lesions and showing no signs of incapacitation. Furthermore, aquarium trials showed no post-impact mortality after a 2 wk period. Therefore, the biopsy probe tested {{in this study is}} considered successful when the <b>spear</b> <b>gun</b> is fired at the correct power for the target species. This will allow for easier tissue sample collection from small- to medium-sized teleost fish for population and phylogenetic studies than previous methods of killing or capturing individuals...|$|R
