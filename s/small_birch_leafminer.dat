50|$|Ectoedemia occultella, the <b>small</b> <b>birch</b> <b>leafminer,</b> is a moth of the Nepticulidae family. It has a Holarctic distribution. It {{is found}} in most of Europe, east through Russia (where it has been {{recorded}} from Murmansk, Karelia, Leningrad, Samara and Tatarstan and Sakhalin) to Japan. It is also present in North America. Mines {{very similar to that}} of Ectoedemia occultella have been found on Rosaceae species in Nepal and Japan and these may belong to this species.|$|E

50|$|Following {{trials in}} 1995 that {{supported}} a dramatic reduction in <b>birch</b> <b>leafminer</b> damage {{by the first}} parasitoid, the City of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada discontinued pesticide treatments to almost 3,500 city birch trees in 1996 and 1997. These trees continue to show very little leafminer damage without any treatment.|$|R
50|$|<b>Birch</b> <b>leafminer</b> is {{a common}} pest which feeds from inside of the leaf and causes the leaf to turn brown, the first {{generation}} appears in May {{but there will be}} several generations per year. Severe infestations may stress the tree and make it more vulnerable to the bronze birch borer.|$|R
50|$|Spinosad {{can be used}} {{to control}} <b>birch</b> <b>leafminers</b> prior to {{extensive}} damage. Spinosad is a new chemical class of insecticides derived from a soil dwelling bacterium discovered in 1982. It is considered practically non-toxic to humans, pets, and beneficial insects. Unlike other insecticides, Spinosad will not harm beneficial insects including the Amber Marked Leafminer parasite.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two species}} mainly {{responsible}} for defoliation and browning of birch {{trees in the}} United States and Canada. In Northern forests, it is the Amber Marked Leafminer, Profenusa thomsoni, which were accidentally introduced from Europe to North America early in the 1900s. The other is the <b>Birch</b> <b>Leafminer,</b> Fenusa pusilla, which {{is more common in}} Eastern forests.|$|R
50|$|Presently {{there is}} no commercially {{available}} biological control agent to control Amber marked <b>birch</b> <b>leafminers,</b> however Canadian trees in the Edmonton area have been successfully controlled with releases of a parasitic wasp, Lathrolestes luteolator. Populations of the tiny parasitoid wasp selectively attack the most damaging birch leafmining pest (Profenusa thomsoni) have developed and drastically reduced {{the problem in the}} Edmonton area of Canada.|$|R
50|$|<b>Birch</b> <b>leafminers</b> are sawflies, {{which are}} closely related to bees and wasps. They are among the most common insect pests {{affecting}} Birch trees (Betula spp.) in North America. Areas inside the leaves are consumed by the larvae affecting the leaves' ability to produce food. Yearly browning of birch leaves are noticed in mid July and August, but the leafminers have been feeding inside the leaf tissue since early spring.|$|R
50|$|The {{areas of}} leaves that are {{consumed}} by the amber marked <b>birch</b> <b>leafminer</b> larva turn brown. Because people often {{do not see the}} early signs of <b>birch</b> <b>leafminer</b> feeding, it often appears the tree has suddenly dried up or become diseased. This browning is caused by the outer layers of the leaf drying out after the leaf miner larva has consumed the green tissue between the outer layers of the leaf. Early mines appear as light green or whitish discolorations on the leaves. Larvae sometimes can be seen easily when leaves are held up to sunlight, especially as the mines and larvae grow larger. Feeding over several weeks causes the blemish to take on a blister-like appearance. A single leaf can contain as many as 40 larvae whose mines may merge to destroy the total photosynthetic area of the leaf. Heavy infestations of leafminer larvae can seriously affect a tree's photosynthetic capacity. Repeated attacks will generally cause stress which may induce susceptibility of the tree to other injurious agents.|$|R
40|$|To our knowledge, {{reports of}} Betula spp. {{resistance}} against {{damage caused by}} the <b>birch</b> <b>leafminer,</b> Fenusa pusilla (Lepeletier), have not been published. Becker (1938), Friend (1933), and Johnson and Lyon (1976) stated that B. populifolia Marsh., B. papyrifera Marsh., and B. alba L. are the most commonly attacked species. Friend (1933) and Johnson and Lyon (1976) stated that B. lenta L., B. alleghaniensis Britt, and B. nigra L. have never been observed infested or are rarely fed upo...|$|R
50|$|Leafminers overwinter in {{the soil}} as prepupae. Adults emerge in May to late June to early July, {{depending}} on temperature and humidity. Oviposition (egg-laying) peaks {{during the last week}} of June. Adult <b>birch</b> <b>leafminers</b> are <b>small</b> (about 1/8 to 1/4 inch long), black and fly like. Females deposit their eggs singly in slits cut in the central areas of young leaves, usually near the tips of branches. More than one female may lay eggs in a leaf.|$|R

50|$|Following {{decommissioning}} and abandonment, {{the reservoir}} naturally became a <b>small</b> <b>birch</b> forest (one {{of the few}} on Long Island) with a grassy marsh in the center basin.

60|$|They {{traced back}} {{the path of}} the wounded beast from the spot where Grierson had found it, by the red {{splashes}} that here and there stained the short grass of the unfenced prairie.

50|$|The river flat has {{a mixture}} of poplar trees, alder and willow bushes, with open grassy meadows. The steep {{hillside}} behind the site is covered with vegetation typical of a northern exposure boreal forest - thick moss, spruce, and <b>small</b> <b>birch</b> groves. On the bench above the flat, mining activity has stripped away both vegetation and soil, leaving a fringe of the original spruce forest {{along the edge of}} the river bluffs.|$|R
60|$|The {{evening was}} dull and gloomy, a gray sky {{hung over the}} desolate hills, and Millicent, sitting alone on a rocky slope, felt troubled and depressed. Beneath her, the long hollow that crossed the big divide {{stretched}} back, colored in cheerless neutral tints, into drifting mist. It was sprinkled with little ponds, and banded here and there with belts of stunted trees, <b>small</b> <b>birches</b> and willows, and ragged cedars that hid the oozy muskegs under them.|$|R
25|$|She {{was buried}} fully dressed on a cowhide in the coffin. She wore a loose bodice with sleeves {{reaching}} the elbow. She had a bare waist {{and wore a}} short string skirt. She had bronze bracelets and a woolen belt with a large disc decorated with spirals and a spike. At her feet were the cremated remains of a child age 56. By her head there was a <b>small</b> <b>birch</b> bark box which contained an awl, bronze pins and a hair net.|$|R
60|$|Crossing the rise, {{he headed}} for a glow of light that flickered in the gloom of a <b>small</b> <b>birch</b> bluff, and {{presently}} stopped at a tent pitched among the trees. Two big red oxen were grazing by {{the edge of the}} bluff, a row of birch logs lay among the grass beside a pile of ship-lap boards, and some more of the boards had been roughly built into a pointed shack. In front of this a young girl bent over a fire that burned between two logs. All round, except where the wood broke the view, the wilderness rolled away, dim and silent.|$|R

"It won't be {{altogether}} a trip of diskivery neither, for I've {{got some}} bales of goods with me, {{and as we}} go in a <b>small</b> <b>birch</b> canoe, we'll travel light; but I hope to come back sunk to the gunwale with furs, for the red-skins of the far north are like enough to have plenty of pelts, and they won't ask much for them.

60|$|When {{they reached}} the top of the ascent, she mounted and they went on among {{scattered}} clumps of pines and across a tableland as fast as he could travel, because it seemed prudent to place as long a distance as possible between them and the settlement. He had left the place with a valuable horse and saddle which he had not paid for, and he was very dubious whether the livery-stable keeper would be satisfied with the promises he had left. Accordingly he only stopped for half an hour at noon; and evening was near when he helped the girl down and picketed the horse beside a <b>small</b> <b>birch</b> bluff, and set up the tent.|$|R
25|$|The nature {{varies from}} barren coastal areas facing the Barents Sea, to more {{sheltered}} fjord areas and river valleys with gullies and tree vegetation.

60|$|He trotted {{away with}} his {{companion}} and it was evening when they rode {{along the edge of}} a ravine which pierced a high tract of rolling country. The crest of the slope they followed commanded a vast circle of grass that was changing in the foreground from green to ocher and silvery white. Farther back, it ran on toward the sunset, a sweep of blue and neutral gray, flecked with dusky lines of bluffs, interspersed with gleaming strips of water, but nowhere in the wide landscape was there a sign of human habitation. <b>Small</b> <b>birches</b> and poplars, with an undergrowth of nut bushes, clothed the sides of the ravine, but some distance ahead it broadened out and the stream that flowed through it turned the hollow into a muskeg. There harsh grass and reeds grew three or four feet high, hiding the stretch of mire.|$|R
6000|$|It is also {{interesting}} and curious {{to note that}} a bird which inhabits two countries, in summer and winter, regulates his habits {{in accordance with the}} degree of friendliness or hostility exhibited towards him by the human inhabitants of the respective areas. The bird has in fact two traditions with regard to man's attitude towards him--one for each country. Thus, the field-fare is an exceedingly shy bird in England, but when he returns to the north if his breeding place is in some inhabited district in northern Sweden or Norway he loses all his wildness and builds his nest quite close to the houses. My friend Trevor Battye saw a pair busy making their nest in a <b>small</b> <b>birch</b> within a few yards of the front door of a house he was staying at. [...] "How strange," [...] said he to the man of the house, [...] "to see field-fares making a nest in such a place!" ...|$|R
60|$|A few coppers {{sent the}} youth of the ragged head away in high spirits. The young man watched him till he was {{concealed}} by a clump of <b>small</b> <b>birch</b> trees that hung like a fringe {{on the top of}} a neighbouring precipice. Barret had just turned to continue the ascent to the Eagle Cliff, whose frowning battlements still rose high above him, when a wild shout from the boy made him turn and look anxiously back. The place which he had reached was strewn with great masses of rock that had fallen from the cliffs. He was about to clamber on to one of these, in order to obtain a better view, when the cause of the shout became obvious. A splendid stag, frightened from its lair by the boy, burst from the birchwood, and, with antlers laid well back, bounded up the slope towards him. It was closely followed by two does.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Through a {{field study}} in Abisko, {{northern}} Sweden, {{we have used}} the artificial avalanche release system DaisyBell together with snow profiles to study the effect of alpine birch forest on ava-lanche formation. Evergreen conifers have long been known to reduce avalanche formation probability, however, in Scandinavia, the <b>small</b> <b>birch</b> type Alpine betula {{is the most common}} tree species in mountain-ous regions. Its effect on snow stability has been unknown, but of crucial importance for backcountry rec-reationists and for housing and mountain cabin planning. This paper presents the results from the field campaign. We show that triggering of avalanches was much more successful in open terrain than inside the birch forest. Crack propagation was significantly hindered in vicinity of trees and the snow pack layer-ing differed to a large degree when moving few meters from inside the forest to open terrain nearby. The use of DaisyBell inside forest is novel, and experience with this practice can also be transferred to other types of demanding terrain...|$|R
2500|$|When {{the island}} was first settled, it was {{extensively}} forested. In the late 12th century, Ari the Wise described it in the Íslendingabók as [...] "forested from mountain to sea shore". Permanent human settlement greatly disturbed the isolated ecosystem of thin, volcanic soils and limited species diversity. The forests were heavily exploited over the centuries for firewood and timber. Deforestation, climatic deterioration during the Little Ice Age, and overgrazing by sheep imported by settlers caused a loss of critical topsoil due to erosion. Today, many farms have been abandoned. Three-quarters of Iceland's 100,000 square kilometres is affected by soil erosion, [...] serious {{enough to make the}} land useless. Only a few <b>small</b> <b>birch</b> stands now exist in isolated reserves. The planting of new forests has increased the number of trees, but the result does not compare to the original forests. Some of the planted forests include introduced species. The tallest tree in Iceland is a sitka spruce planted in 1949 in Kirkjubæjarklaustur; it was measured at [...] in 2013.|$|R

5000|$|There {{is little}} {{information}} available about Wampanoag maritime craft. Their boats {{were small and}} assuredly used frequently on coastal waters, rivers and streams when the Wampanoag were fishing and hunting. Canoes were also used for occasional trading trips to other islands and the mainland. The short trees of Nantucket could provide logs from which to make a <b>small</b> canoe. <b>Birch</b> was very rare, if present at all, and if birch bark canoes were on Nantucket, they were imported.|$|R
5000|$|A young brave {{regularly}} paddled {{around the}} perimeter of Cold Lake (“Luwe Chok Tuwe” in Dene) to visit a beautiful young girl who he hoped would one day be his wife. It is safer to travel {{around the perimeter}} of Cold Lake because the wind can rapidly whip up large waves which can swamp a <b>small</b> <b>birch</b> bark canoe. This particular evening was calm and the lake was like glass so the brave decided to take a short cut across the water. As he got farther out, the water around him began to swirl. There was a thundering splash as the Kinosoo ("big fish" [...] in Dene) roared up and bit the canoe in half. The brave desperately tried to beat off the Kinosoo with his paddle but soon disappeared below the waves. The young girl {{on the other side of}} Bay witnessed the struggle and waited in vain for her beloved to appear. The next morning a broken paddle and bits of canoe drifted ashore and the brave was never seen again.So from this day forward the Dene have avoided crossing large expanses of open water in their canoes.|$|R
40|$|In the progeny of Betula oycoviensis pollinated {{with the}} pollen of Betula oycoviensis three groups were distinguished: oycovlensis type, verrucosa type, and „nova" type (a <b>small</b> dwarf <b>birch).</b> The number of {{chromosomes}} determined in the parental specimens {{and in several}} descendent plants belonging to the three types was in all cases 2 n= 28.

60|$|Gallwey, who {{was wrapped}} in an old fur coat from cheeks to ankles, proved an {{agreeable}} companion. He led her first a little way back among the slender birches, where {{she could see the}} house. It was, she decided, by no means picturesque, a rambling, frame structure roofed with cedar shingles, built round what was evidently the original hut of <b>small</b> <b>birch</b> logs; but it had a little verandah with rude pillars and trellis work on one side of it, and Gallwey assured her there were not many houses in that country to equal it. Then he showed her the barns and stables, built in part of birch logs {{and for the rest of}} sods, stretching back into the shelter of the bluff. They were primitive and almost shapeless structures, with roofs that apparently consisted of straw and soil and snow, but she fancied their thickness would keep out even the frost of the Northwest. There were, however, only a horse or two and a few brawny oxen standing in them. Last of all, he led her into one of the most curious edifices she had ever seen. Sitting down on one of the wheat bags inside it, she looked about her.|$|R

50|$|In {{northern}} Germany (Ostholstein) the vegetational evolution {{was very}} similar. Remarkable {{here is the}} rapid rise of non-tree pollen from 30 to more than 80% (including an increase in cereals from 2 to over 20%) during the younger subatlantic. Amongst the tree pollen the mixed oak forest {{was able to keep}} its share of 30%. Alders were also retreating from 40 to 25%. Let alone <b>small</b> fluctuations <b>birch,</b> beech and hornbeam overall conserved their share (hornbeam showed a distinct peak at the beginning younger subatlantic). Pine trees were also augmenting during the youngest subatlantic.|$|R
