5|$|Most cnidarians prey on organisms {{ranging in}} size from {{plankton}} to animals several times larger than themselves, but many obtain much of their nutrition from dinoflagellates, and a few are parasites. Many are preyed on by other animals including starfish, sea slugs, fish, turtles, and even other cnidarians. Many scleractinian corals—which form the <b>structural</b> <b>foundation</b> for coral reefs—possess polyps that are filled with symbiotic photo-synthetic zooxanthellae. While reef-forming corals are almost entirely restricted to warm and shallow marine waters, other cnidarians can be found at great depths, in polar regions, and in freshwater.|$|E

They proposed a kind of neuroanthropology which would lay the foundations for a more complete scientific account of cultural similarity and variation by requiring an integration of cultural anthropology and neuroscience—a program that theorists such as Victor Turner also embraced.|$|E

2500|$|In {{all these}} ways – the {{organization}} of the new police, the new Poor Law, and in the new municipal councils – the pattern of government in England was changed fundamentally within a single decade. [...] In conjunction with the removal of religious disabilities, these reforms laid the <b>structural</b> <b>foundation</b> for a new kind of State in Britain: a State in which the electoral rights and civil rights of citizens were extended and given greater legal protection, but in which the ordinary citizen was subjected to a much greater degree of administrative interference, direction, and control from the centre. [...] The most spectacular element in this whole process – the Reform Bill of 1832 – ensured that the state should also be partially democratized at the centre. [...] The full significance of 1832 {{in the history of the}} country is appreciated only if it is seen as the central change in this mini-sided transformation of an agricultural nation ruled by squires, parsons, and the wealthy landowners into an industrial nation dominated by the classes produced by industrial expansion and commercial enterprise.|$|E

The results, however, are non-unique and are highly dependent upon the skill of the operator and the subsequent interpretation of the data.|$|E

Designed by the Cleveland architectural firm of Garfield, Stanley-Brown, Harris and Robinson; the plain, box-like exterior, flat roofs, and lack of ornament identify the Federal Building as International Style architecture.|$|E

50|$|In the {{offshore}} drilling industry, the conductor pipe {{is set in}} the seabed, and is a key <b>structural</b> <b>foundation</b> for the subsea wellhead. When drilling an offshore well, a marine riser is connected to the well, and this is subjected to large environmental forces such as current and waves which are transferred to the conductor. The forces can be large and also cyclical which can potentially cause fatigue damage to the conductor, especially in harsh environmental conditions. A Conductor tensioner unit (CTU) can be used in shallow water on jackup rig to withstand such damaging forces.|$|E
