5|$|The Polikarpov I-6 was a Soviet biplane fighter {{prototype}} of the late 1920s. It was designed with traditional wooden construction {{in comparison with the}} wood and <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> construction Polikarpov I-5. Its development took longer than planned and the lead designer, Nikolai Polikarpov, was arrested for industrial sabotage, which only further delayed the project. Only two prototypes were built, as the I-5 was selected for production.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Honda {{introduced}} their newer NF series motorcycles, known as Honda Wave series, called the Honda Innova in some markets, which use <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> frames, front disc brake and plastic cover sets in various displacement options: 100cc, 110cc and 125cc. Though not Cubs, these bikes sold consistently well particularly in European countries, where {{the production of}} Honda Cub models had been previously discontinued. However, the production of Honda Cubs in Asia, Africa and South America still continues today, even though the newer Honda Wave Series and other designs have been introduced alongside the Cub.|$|E
5|$|Replacement of the ship's -tall, -wide lower masts in {{wood was}} not feasible, {{so they were}} made of <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> cut and welded to shape, with a ladder inside each mast to allow access to the {{platforms}} on the masts. The three masts and the bowsprit were stepped in place between September 1984 and February 1985. Warriors engines, boilers and auxiliary machinery were considered too expensive to rebuild, so replicas were built from sheet steel with a few components made from cast iron to duplicate the look of the real equipment. The replica engines can rotate slowly, using electrical power, to allow visitors to imagine how they might have looked in operation.|$|E

40|$|A {{study on}} the bending {{strength}} of design of thin-walled centrifugal concrete-filled <b>steel</b> <b>tubes</b> was conducted in this study. An accurate finite element model of centrifugal concrete-filled <b>steel</b> <b>tubes</b> was developed using the finite element program ABAQUS. Centrifugal concrete-filled <b>steel</b> <b>tubes</b> different cross sections and material properties were simulated in this study. The nonlinear finite element model was verified against the experimental results. Generally the finite element model could accurately simulate the bending strength of centrifugal concrete-filled <b>steel</b> <b>tubes.</b> Parametric {{study was conducted to}} investigate specimens having concrete tubes of different grades. Current AISC standard was used to predict the bending strength of thin-walled centrifugal concrete-filled <b>steel</b> <b>tubes</b> and empirical design equations are also proposed for simplicity.

5|$|Major {{changes to}} the {{original}} Verdeja 1 included removing the turret {{and replacing it with}} a gun shield with 10millimetre thick steel armor. This meant that much of the chassis' roof and rear wall was eliminated. The howitzer was designed as a monoblock <b>steel</b> <b>tube,</b> using a double-baffle muzzle brake, with twelve twists completing a full turn every forty calibers. As mounted, the howitzer could fire between 0.5° and 25°, and move 4.5° either left or right. The crew could stow eight rounds of ammunition in a ready-round stowage area near the walls of the gun shield {{on each side of the}} breech, allowing easy access to projectiles. Otherwise, the vehicle could store another 24 rounds in an auxiliary carriage. The carriage was based on the axles and wheels of a PaK 36 anti-tank gun. A unique feature of this prototype was a mechanical brake built into the idler-wheel to the rear of the chassis, guaranteeing the vehicle's stability when firing and avoiding damage to the transmission.|$|E

40|$|In this study, the concrete-steel bond {{strength}} of concrete filled cylindrical <b>steel</b> <b>tubes</b> has been experimentally investigated. 22 short, high strength and normal concrete filled circular <b>steel</b> <b>tubes</b> were tested.

The <b>steel</b> <b>tubes</b> were welded type with the nominal inside diameters of 3, 4, 6 and 8 inches.

An MTCC consists of a series of small <b>steel</b> <b>tubes</b> embedded in concrete that is then confined by an external FRP tube. This sectional configuration ensures that the <b>steel</b> <b>tubes</b> are well protected by the concrete and the FRP tube from corrosion, and that the concrete is well confined by both the <b>steel</b> <b>tubes</b> and the FRP tube, leading to a columns that is highly ductile- and corrosion-resistant.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} detailed {{results of}} a series of pullout tests on cogged deformed reinforcing bars embedded in concrete filled <b>steel</b> <b>tubes.</b> To evaluate confinement effects on anchorage performance, tests were carried out on <b>steel</b> <b>tubes</b> with different diameter to thickness ratios. Both hoop strains and longitudinal strains in the tubes were measured, together with applied load and slip. Various lead-in lengths before the bend and length of tailed extension after the bend were examined. Pullout tests were conducted with both monotonic and cyclic loading. All of the tested specimens failed by bar fracture outside the <b>steel</b> <b>tubes.</b> Although the provided development length is less than the required value in AS 3600, adequate anchorage capacity was achieved. In addition, a spring stiffness model had been developed to theoretically simulate the pullout tests. Reasonable agreement between the experimental and analytical results was obtained. The test results provide valuable information on the anchorage mechanism of cogged deformed bars inserted in concrete filled <b>steel</b> <b>tubes...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{local and}} post-local {{buckling}} behaviour of <b>steel</b> <b>tubes</b> in thin-walled circular concrete-filled steel tubular columns under axial load is presented. Geometric and material nonlinear {{finite element analysis}} is conducted on <b>steel</b> <b>tubes</b> under uniform edge compression to determine critical local and post-local buckling strengths. The local and post-local buckling of <b>steel</b> <b>tubes</b> reduces the ultimate loads of thinwalled circular CFST columns under axial compression. Limited experimental research on CFST columns has been conducted. The effects of local and postlocal buckling on the behaviour of thin-walled circular CFST columns have not been adequately researched. Three-dimensional finite element models are developed using the finite element technique. Initial geometric imperfections, residual stresses, material yielding and strain hardening are considered in the analysis. Based on the results obtained from the nonlinear finite element analysis, a set of design formulas is proposed for determining the critical local buckling loads and ultimate strengths of <b>steel</b> <b>tubes</b> in thin-walled circular CFST columns. The proposed design formulas are verified by comparisons with existing experimental results...|$|R
