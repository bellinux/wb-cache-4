40|$|Seabirds in the UK were {{generally}} more productive in 2005 than in 2004, when productivity for many species reached an all-time low. A presumed scarcity of <b>sandeels</b> in 2004, {{especially in the}} North Sea, led to widespread starvation of chicks in the Northern Isles and in many places along {{the east coast of}} Britain (there is also recent evidence that prey fish were of unusually low energy content in 2004 around SE Scotland). The likely knock-on effect for 2005 was that there were few larger <b>sandeels</b> present (those that hatched in 2004) and it is thought that feeding on these fish allow adults to attain breeding condition in spring. This food scarcity and a cold spring led to what was among the latest breeding seasons on record. However, a late appearance of young <b>sandeels</b> allowed some chicks to fledge, and alternative prey species (such as sprat and small haddock) were taken also. However, it is thought that some chicks starved in this late season, as <b>sandeels</b> become unavailable in late summer, when they settle on the seabed. Unusually, 2005 was a very poor breeding season for many species in NW Scotland, which was spared the food shortages of 2004 and previous years; preferred prey during chick rearing were scarce in this region in 2005...|$|R

40|$|Local {{differences}} in feeding conditions {{have been suggested}} {{as a cause of}} regional variation in seabird demography but multi-colony comparisons of diet are rare. In UK waters the main fish eaten by seabirds during the breeding season belong to three families: Ammodytidae, Clupeidae and Gadidae. Climate change and fishing are affecting these fish stocks and so probably impact on predators such as seabirds. We used standardized observations of prey brought in for chicks to make the first integrated assessment of the diet of Common Guillemot Uria aalge chicks at a UK scale. Chick diet varied markedly among the 23 colonies sampled between 2006 and 2011. <b>Sandeels</b> (Ammodytidae), probably Lesser <b>Sandeels</b> Ammodytes marinus, were the commonest prey. Their contribution to the diet varied both latitudinally and among marine regions, with the proportion significantly higher for a given latitude on the west coast compared to the east. The non-sandeel component of the diet showed latitudinal changes, with small clupeids, probably Sprats Sprattus sprattus, predominant at southern colonies whereas juvenile gadids were the main alternative to <b>sandeels</b> in the north. Comparison of our Guillemot chick diet with data collected 15 – 30 years earlier suggests that the proportion of <b>sandeels</b> in the diet has decreased at colonies bordering the North Sea. No significant change was apparent in Atlantic colonies but historical data were limited. The early years of our study coincided with a population explosion of Snake Pipefish Entelurus aequoreus in the Northeast Atlantic and North Sea. Pipefish were recorded in Guillemot chick diet at several northern and northwestern colonies in 2006 and 2007 but have been absent since 2009. Spatial and temporal variation in chick diet accorded broadly with patterns expected as a result of rising sea temperatures and impacts of fishing. Guillemot chick diet could potentially be a useful indicator of changes in the distribution and abundance of forage fish. ...|$|R

Declines at the west coast of the North Sea were attributed to a lower abundance and lower quality of the key prey, <b>sandeels.</b> We hypothesised that kittiwakes at Helgoland do not rely as heavily on <b>sandeels</b> as their conspecifics. We analysed stomach contents of nestlings and adults of 2001, 2002, 2004 and 2006. In concordance with earlier studies of the 1980 s and 1990 s, young whiting was the most important prey species in 2001, 2002 and 2004. Clupeids and <b>sandeels</b> were consumed in lower proportions. While earlier studies suggested whiting to originate from fisheries discards, evidence now supports that kittiwakes prey upon whiting in areas of hydrographic fronts. No whiting was recovered in samples of 2006 and the proportion of fish prey was low. Main prey items were polychaete worms (Nereidae), which were presumably consumed as swarming Heteronereis stages.

40|$|In {{this review}} we {{summarize}} {{what is known}} about mechanisms by which climate change may be affecting the populations of seabirds around the UK. Breeding success and adult survival are the key factors affecting changes in seabird populations, and food intake is implicated as a major determinant of both. The diet of most UK seabird species is almost exclusively <b>sandeels,</b> small clupeoid fish or zooplankton and {{it is clear that the}} marine pelagic food web is the key ecological system determining food supply. Hence, we develop the review by first considering how climate changes may affect primary production, and then examine how this propagates through the food web to zooplankton and fish culminating in fluctuations in seabird numbers. A trend of increasing numbers of many seabird species since 1970, particularly puffins, guillemots and razorbills, appears to have been reversed since 2000. The proximate cause of the recent declines seems to be a succession of 5 years of low breeding success for a range of species due to a shortage of food, especially <b>sandeels.</b> However, the connection with climate change remains uncertain, thoug...|$|R

Cytological investigation revealed that the transition in gonad development from primary to secondary stages occurred between June and August in both sexes. Using logistical regression, variation in maturation could be attributed to both initial weight and observed differences in resource accrual during this period, suggesting that if growth prior to this period is inadequate in smaller fish then maturation remains inhibited. For those females that did mature, potential fecundity positively correlated with final body size.

A small percentage of individuals, by decreasing frequency, also fed on polar cod, Atlantic cod, haddock, and copepods. Capelin dominated off Bear Island and in the southern Barents Sea, accounting for about three-quarters of their diet in both regions. Nearly half (nearly 46 per cent) also consumed euphausiids (Thysanoessa spp.) in the former area - haddock (12.5%), blue whiting (8.3%), polar cod, Atlantic cod, Atlantic herring, and copepods constituted the rest. Herring and haddock were also taken in the southern Barents Sea (accounting for 41.5 and 28.7 per cent by frequency of occurrence, respectively), while <b>sandeel</b> (Ammodytes spp.), Atlantic cod, copepods, euphausiids, pollock, and blue whiting made {{up the rest of}} the diet. In the Norwegian Sea, herring was found in all individuals sampled (n= 10), with some (20 per cent each) also feeding on a small amount of capelin and blue whiting - an earlier study, based on data primarily obtained between 1943-1945, showed that they fed exclusively on herring off Vesterålen, while the diet off Lofoten was more varied, including herring (34 per cent by occurrence), pelagic crustaceans (23%), Atlantic cod (22%), haddock (6%), and a mixture of coalfish and flatfish for one individual (1.5%). In the North Sea, they primarily fed on <b>sandeel</b> (62%) and Atlantic mackerel (nearly 30%), with some feeding on herring (16.2%), small amounts of Mueller's pearlside (10.8%), copepods, haddock, capelin, and whiting. They were found to feed almost exclusively on Atlantic mackerel in the northern North Sea, while the same was true for <b>sandeel</b> in the eastern North Sea. Off Iceland, they mainly fed on <b>sandeel</b> (nearly 58 per cent of sampled individuals), haddock (22.6%), herring (20%), capelin (19.4%), and Atlantic cod (14.7%), with the rest of the diet consisting of euphausiids, various larger species of gadiods, and Norway pout. <b>Sandeel</b> was more important in southern Iceland (constituting 78 per cent of sampled individuals), while capelin (35.1%), haddock (28.7%), and cod (22.3%) were more important in the north.

40|$|The harbour {{porpoise}} Phocoena phocoena {{is currently the}} most abundant marine mammal in Belgian waters. Large-scale changes {{in the distribution of}} this top predator in the North Sea have occurred during the last decades, possibly caused by changes in food availability. An analysis of the strandings database 1970 - 2011, containing data on 737 {{harbour porpoise}}s, revealed that throughout the year two peaks in strandings occurred: one in spring, for an important part caused by the strandings of animals incidentally bycaught in fishing gear, and a second one during summer. Most of the stranded animals were juveniles, with a higher percentage of males than females. As could be expected, bycaught animals were on average heavier than equally sized naturally died animals, and they had a thicker blubber layer. In naturally died animals the blubber layer was thicker in winter than in summer, illustrating the insulating function of the blubber layer besides its function as an energy storage. We investigated the stomach content of 64 harbour porpoises washed ashore or bycaught in Belgium between 1997 and 2011. Ten of the stomachs were empty. Fish contributed to most of the prey remains. In total we found the remains of 19 fish species belonging to 10 families. The numerically most important prey items in juveniles were gobies (Gobiidae). Reconstructing the original weight of the prey items revealed that gobies constituted the most important prey by weight, but that larger <b>sandeels</b> (Ammodytidae) {{and to a lesser extent}} gadoids (Gadidae) were also important. In adults the majority of prey items were gobies and <b>sandeels,</b> but the reconstructed weight of the stomach content revealed that <b>sandeels</b> and gadoids constituted by far the most important prey. Surprisingly, clupeids (Clupeidae) did not contribute much to the diet, although the return of the harbour porpoise is often linked to an increase in herring Clupea harengu stocks in the southern North Sea. Also no twaite shad Alosa fallax were found, although this diadromic fish is common again in the area. A small number of smelt Osmerus eperlanus was found in some of the recently stranded harbour porpoises. Smelt is a diadromic fish of which densities are increasing from very low levels. The fact that juvenile harbour porpoises had apparently fed on large quantities of small bottom fish may help to explain why they were more prone to bycatch than adults.

The {{aim of this study}} was to provide a current assessment of diet to inform policy issues related to the impact of the still increasing grey seal population on commercial fish populations. During 2002, nine sampling trips totalling 56 days were completed around western Scotland, resulting in the collection of 1, 589 grey seal scats. Forty-nine prey species were recorded in these samples revealing that grey seals on the west coast of Scotland remain highly catholic in their diet. Seasonal and regional variation in diet composition was assessed and the annual consumption of commercial fish species estimated. Proportions, by weight, of prey species indicated that gadoids were the main prey. <b>Sandeels</b> were also an important component of the diet. Comparisons between 1985 and 2002 revealed many similarities in diet composition but declines in the importance of <b>sandeels,</b> ling and megrim were balanced by increases in haddock, lemon sole, pelagic species and several benthic species. Changes in the size of fish stocks partially explain some of these changes.

LRT were characterised by high diving efficiency (the proportion of the dive cycle spent foraging) and low feeding rates (mass of prey caught per second foraging). In contrast, diving efficiency was lower and feeding rates were higher for SRT. The gross intake rate (the product of diving efficiency and feeding rate) was significantly higher in SRT than LRT. We suggest that the observed switch in preferred feeding area was caused by the sudden appearance of large numbers of small lesser <b>sandeels</b> Ammodytes marinus in the waters just off the Isle of May. The higher feeding rates attained by birds on SRT could have been due to higher concentrations of prey and/or reduced foraging costs associated with unsuitable habitat for <b>sandeels</b> in this area. Results from this study suggest that the distribution of available resources influences the choice of foraging areas in Shag...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The harbour {{porpoise}} (Phocoena phocoena) {{is probably the}} most abundant small cetacean in the northeast Atlantic and as such is an important top predator. It {{is also one of the}} most threatened species, particularly as a consequence of fishery by-catch. Porpoises feed mainly on small shoaling fishes from both demersal and pelagic habitats. Many prey items are probably taken on, or very close to, the sea bed. Even though a wide range of species has been recorded in the diet, porpoises in any one area tend to feed primarily on two to four main species (e. g. whiting (Merlangius merlangus) and <b>sandeels</b> (Ammodytidae) in Scottish waters). Evidence for selective predation is equivocal. Many studies provide evidence of geographic, seasonal, interannual, ontogenetic or sexual differences in prey types or prey sizes, and such dif-ferences are often (speculatively) interpreted in terms of prey availability. A few studies demon-strate trends in diet selection that are consistent with changes in prey abundance. However, lack of availability of prey abundance data at an appropriate spatial and temporal scale is often a problem. Porpoise diets overlap extensively with diets of other piscivorous marine predators (notably seals). Many of the main prey species are also taken by commercial fisheries, although por-poises tend to take smaller fishes than those targeted by fisheries. Given their high abundance, porpoises clearly remove substantial quantities of fish. The literature on porpoise diets in the northeast Atlantic suggests that there has been a long-term shift from predation on clupeid fish (mainly herring Clupea harengus) to predation on <b>sandeels</b> and gadoid fish, possibly related to the decline in herring stocks since the mid- 1960 s. Evidence from studies on seals suggests that such a shift could have adverse health con-sequences. Food consumption brings porpoises into contact with two important threats – persistent organic contaminants and fishing nets, both of which have potentially serious impacts...|$|R
