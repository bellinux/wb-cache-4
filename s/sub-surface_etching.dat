40|$|Catalytic {{hydrogenation}} of graphite {{has recently}} attracted renewed attention, as a route for nano-patterning of graphene and to produce graphene nano-ribbons. These reports show that metallic nanoparticles etch surface layers of graphite, or graphene anisotropically along the crystallographic zigzag or armchair directions. On graphene the etching direction can {{be influenced by}} external magnetic fields or the substrate. Here we report the <b>sub-surface</b> <b>etching</b> of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) by Ni nanoparticles, to form a network of tunnels, as seen by SEM and STM. In this new nanoporous form of graphite, the top layers bend inward {{on top of the}} tunnels, while their local density of states remains fundamentally unchanged. Engineered nanoporous tunnel networks in graphite allow further chemical modification and may find applications in storage or sensing...|$|E
40|$|Nanocrystalline silicon {{thin films}} were grown using gaseous mixture of 5 % silane (SiH 4) diluted in {{hydrogen}} (H 2) and argon (Ar) {{in a radio}} frequency (13. 56 MHz) plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition technique. These films were deposited {{as a function of}} pressure and were characterized using AFM, Laser Raman, UV-VIS transmission, photoluminescence and electrical conductivity techniques. AFM micrographs shows that these films contain nanocrystallites of 30 - 60 nm size. Laser Raman peaks at 520 cm(- 1) and photoluminescence peaks at 2. 75 and 2. 85 eV have been observed. The crystalline fraction in these films was varied from 30 % to 80 % with the variation of deposition pressure from 2 Torr to 8 Torr. There is an optimum pressure of 4 Torr where the maximum growth of nanocrystalline phases was observed. It has been found that nanocrystallites in these film enhanced the optical band gap and electrical conductivity. Also a voltage-current (V-I) probe was used to evaluate the various electrical parameters of the plasma used to deposit the nc-Si:H films for the present investigation. Growth via a SiH 3 precursor, diffusion of hydrogen in the <b>sub-surface</b> and argon <b>etching</b> of weak bonds are some of the processes that may be involved in the nano crystallization process...|$|R
