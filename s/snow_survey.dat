40|$|The {{major portion}} of the annual {{precipitation}} in the semi-arid west falls as snow. It piles {{up in the mountains}} and forms the main source of the water in the creeks and rivers draining the mountainous areas. Some of these streams flow the year around while others and intermittent, flowing only as long as the snow in the mountains lasts. The water-supply for irrigation, power development, and municipal purposes is derived largely from winter snows. A knowledge of the extent of the snow cover and its water content is, therefore, necessary for the proper utilization of this great natural resource. Forecasts of reasonable accuracy are of major importance for proper distribution of water-supplies and in flood protection. Measurement of the accumulated snowfall {{at the end of the}} precipitation season furnishes an important index as to the probable water-supply to be derived from the snow cover. A system of <b>snow</b> <b>surveying</b> has been developed by which it is possible to measure the depth and water content of the snow cover at the end of the precipitation season. <b>Snow</b> <b>surveys</b> are now being made on the principal watersheds of Utah, California, and Nevada, as well as in parts of Idaho, Oregon, and Washington.

40|$|The {{design of}} sensor {{networks}} {{for measuring the}} mean and spatial distribution of snow depth at the scale of 1 - 16 km 2 was evaluated by deploying an embedded-sensor network consisting of ultrasonic snow depth sensors to capture the variable physiographic features around an operational snow course in Yosemite National Park in the Sierra Nevada of California. Manual <b>snow</b> <b>surveys</b> were also carried out during accumulation and ablation periods. Four years of continuous data from the embedded-sensor network showed that snow depths during both accumulation and ablation periods can vary as much as 50 % based on variability in topography and vegetation across a 0. 4 ha study area. Spatial <b>snow</b> <b>surveys</b> showed that such a sensor network can be deployed so as to capture both the variability and mean for accumulation and ablation periods across a 1 km 2 area surrounding the sensor network, with a broader network required to extend this to 4 and 16 km 2 areas. In forested areas, higher canopy densities, greater than 60 % closure, {{were associated with the}} lowest snow depths. Analysis of historical snow course records from 14 sites in Yosemite, including the 10 spatial measurements made during each monthly <b>snow</b> course <b>survey,</b> showed <b>snow</b> depths across the 300 m snow course transects to be relatively uniform, with 68 % of all monthly values having standard deviations no more than 10 % of the mean. Although existing snow courses do little to help define the spatial patterns of snow distribution at the 1 - 16 km 2 scales, it is feasible to extend the representativeness of current operational networks by deploying low-cost embeddedsensor networks nearby.

40|$|The California Cooperative <b>Snow</b> <b>Surveys</b> Program {{began in}} 1929 and has {{continued}} since {{as a very}} important water management and regulation tool in the State. Each spring, about 50 agencies pool their efforts in collecting snow data at nearly 270 snow courses in the mountains. The snowpack information, along with precipitation and antecedent river runoff data, are used by Department of Water Resources staff experts to develop forecasts of expected snowmelt runoff and total annual water runoff on the major rivers. These forecasts are used by water agencies, farmers, cities, hydroelectric facility operators, and regulators to manage the available water supply {{for the benefit of}} the State’s farm, urban, and environmental interests. Runoff forecasts are made systematically, based on historical regression relationships between the volume of April through July runoff, and the snow water content, precipitation and runoff in preceding months. The official monthly forecasts depend quite heavily on manual snow course data, whereas periodic updates after major storms rely on daily or even hourly information from about 115 remote snow sensors (snow pillows) which report in by satellite radio. Although most people are just interested in the median future outlook, a range of forecasts from 90 percent sure to 10 percent sure is also provided on most rivers.

40|$|Snow is a {{critical}} storage component in the hydrologic cycle, but current measurement networks are sparse. In addition, the heterogeneity of <b>snow</b> requires <b>surveying</b> larger areas to measure the areal average. We presented snow measurements using GPS interferometric reflectometry (GPS-IR). GPS-IR measures a large area (~ 100 m 2), and existing GPS installations {{around the world have}} the potential to expand existing snow measurement networks. GPS-IR uses a standard, geodetic GPS installation to measure the snow surface via the reflected component of the signal. We reported GPS-IR snow depth measurements made at Niwot Ridge, Colorado, from October 2009 through June 2010. This site is in a topographic saddle at 3500 m elevation with a peak snow depth of 1. 7 m near the GPS antenna. GPS-IR measurements are compared with biweekly <b>snow</b> <b>surveys,</b> a continuously operating scanning laser system and an airborne light detection and ranging (LIDAR) measurement. The GPS-IR measurement of peak snowpack (1. 36 – 1. 76 m) matches manual measurements (0. 95 – 1. 7 m) and the scanning laser (1. 16 m). GPS-IR has RMS error of 13 cm (bias = 10 cm) compared with the laser, although differences between the measurement locations make comparison imprecise. Over the melt season, when the snowpack is more homogenous, the difference between the GPS-IR and the laser is reduced (RMS = 9 cm, bias = 6 cm).

40|$|Soil {{water content}} (SWC) {{measurements}} are crucial worldwide for hydrological predictions, agricultural activities, and monitoring {{the progress of}} reclamation on disturbed land from industrial activities. In colder climates, snow water equivalent (SWE) measurements are equally important, and directly contribute to improved spring water supply forecasting. Both these variables, SWC and SWE, are commonly measured with either point-scale (e. g. soil cores for SWC and snow tubes for SWE) or large-scale (remote sensing) methods. The cosmic-ray soil moisture probe (CRP) was recently developed to fill this gap between small- and large-scale measurements. The CRP provides an average SWC reading in a landscape-scale measurement footprint (300 m radius) {{by taking advantage of}} the relationship between aboveground neutrons and soil water. Although the CRP has proved accurate in relatively homogenous sites, it has not been validated at highly heterogeneous sites. Since snow is simply frozen water, the CRP also has the potential for monitoring SWE at the landscape-scale. However, no calibration has been developed for measuring SWE with the CRP. This thesis aimed to further validate the use of a CRP for measuring SWC at a highly heterogeneous site, and calibrate a CRP for monitoring landscape-scale SWE at an agriculture field. The heterogeneous site used to validate the CRP for SWC measurement was an oil sand reclamation site made up of multiple test plots of varying soil layer treatments. Despite the clear differences in soil texture at the site, the CRP-monitored SWC compared accurately to sampled soil water content and a network of soil moisture probes. With the use of modeling, it was also possible to downscale the CRP measurement to the plot scale. For calibrating the CRP for monitoring SWE, an empirical calibration function was developed based on the relationship between the CRP-measured neutrons and SWE from <b>snow</b> <b>surveys</b> with <b>snow</b> tubes. Using the calibration equation, CRP-estimated SWE closely matched SWE measured from <b>snow</b> <b>surveys.</b> Differences were attributed to mid winter and spring melting of the snowpack along with varying soil water content {{in the top of the}} soil profile.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop a system capable of simulating snow depth and snow water equivalent in the Sherbrooke to Mount-Megantic area of Quebec's Eastern Townships using meteorological and digital terrain data as input. The working hypothesis is that meteorological data may drive a point energy and mass balance snow cover model. The model used was developed by the Hydrologic Research Lab (National Weather Service) which was calibrated for local conditions using field data collected during two winters at several sites on Mount-Megantic. Snow water equivalent and depth are used for calibration and validation of the model. Automated snow sensors were also used to obtain temperature calibration data. The <b>snow</b> <b>surveys</b> and correction of the air temperature for elevation improves the estimates of snow depth and water equivalent.
