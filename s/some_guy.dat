500|$|The band began touring in January 1994 in Oceania and Japan, {{areas where}} the record came out early. The band had never toured these regions before. This round of touring ended in February 1994, and then in March 1994 the band moved on to Europe. The band began a theater tour in the United States on May 27, 1994. The opening acts were Tad and Eleven. In late 1994, after touring in support of Superunknown, doctors {{discovered}} that Cornell had severely strained his vocal cords. Soundgarden cancelled several shows to avoid causing any permanent damage. Cornell said, [...] "I think we kinda overdid it!

500|$|Tech writer Bruce Sterling commented in 2007 {{that using}} Twitter for [...] "literate communication" [...] is [...] "about {{as likely as}} firing up a CB radio and hearing <b>some</b> <b>guy</b> recite the Iliad". In September 2008, the {{journalist}} Clive Thompson mused in a New York Times Magazine editorial that the service had expanded narcissism into [...] "a new, supermetabolic extreme—the ultimate expression of a generation of celebrity-addled youths who believe their every utterance is fascinating {{and ought to be}} shared with the world". One of the earliest documented forms of celebrity-related Twitter-like disclosures dates from 1980, when real estate mogul William Desmond Ryan made round-the-clock press releases about his relationship with comedian Phyllis Diller, even revealing what she was making him for dinner on a nightly basis. Conversely, Vancouver Sun columnist Steve Dotto opined that part of Twitter's appeal is the challenge of trying to publish such messages in tight constraints, and Jonathan Zittrain, professor of Internet law at Harvard Law School, said that [...] "the qualities that make Twitter seem inane and half-baked are what makes it so powerful." ...|$|E

500|$|Tomahawk is {{a musical}} {{supergroup}} consisting of Mike Patton, vocalist for Faith No More and Mr. Bungle; Duane Denison, guitarist for The Jesus Lizard; Kevin Rutmanis, bass player for Melvins; and John Stanier, drummer for Helmet. Mit Gas was recorded after they toured {{with the band}} Tool, whose fans frequently booed Tomahawk off stage during their performances. Denison has likened the experience of playing to the unreceptive and uninterested crowds as similar to [...] "being pro-choice at a [...] Bush rally {{and trying to make}} your point". Subsequently, the band opted to organize their own tour in support of the album, choosing to work with Melvins, Skeleton Key and Dälek. Speaking about the planning required to stage a four-act tour, Patton stated [...] "that's a lot of music. That's {{a lot of time to}} be sitting in some stinking-ass club with <b>some</b> <b>guy</b> puking in your purse". Tool's guitarist Adam Jones offered to direct a video, but the offer was declined by the band. Reports suggested that a cover of the theme from the movie Flashdance What a Feeling was going to be included on the album, although the song was not on the final track listing.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of FutureSex/LoveSounds, Ben Williams of New York cited the album's first five tracks, {{including}} [...] "FutureSex/LoveSound", as updating the early 1980s Minneapolis sound: [...] "tense drum machines, high-pitched synth squiggles and staccato funk bass lines". While reviewing the album, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic noted that the first three songs of the album include the word [...] "sex" [...] in their titles, [...] "as if mere repetition of the word will magically conjure a sex vibe, when in truth it has the opposite effect: it makes it seem that Justin is singing about it because he's not getting it." [...] Lucy Davies of BBC Music stated that it is initially [...] "difficult {{to listen to the}} lyrics of the opening tracks and give an objective opinion". She wrote that it is like Timberlake is [...] "trying to find redeemable qualities about <b>some</b> <b>guy</b> who has zero social skills and stares at women on his own from the corner of a bar.

500|$|The [...] "b-boys" [...] and [...] "b-girls" [...] {{were the}} dancers to Herc's breaks, who were {{described}} as [...] "breaking". Herc has noted that [...] "breaking" [...] was also street slang of the time meaning [...] "getting excited", [...] "acting energetically," [...] or [...] "causing a disturbance". Herc coined the terms [...] "b-boy", [...] "b-girl," [...] and [...] "breaking" [...] which {{became part of the}} lexicon of what would be eventually called hip hop culture. Early Kool Herc b-boy and later DJ innovator Grandmixer DXT describes the early evolution as follows: [...] " ... verybody would form a circle and the B-boys would go into the center. At first the dance was simple: touch your toes, hop, kick out your leg. Then <b>some</b> <b>guy</b> went down, spun around on all fours.

[...] Since this emerging culture was still without a name, participants often identified as [...] "b-boys," [...] a usage that included and went beyond the specific connection to dance, a usage that would persist in hip hop culture.|$|E

Cody Canada, front-man for the band Cross Canadian Ragweed said, [...] ""It's country, folksy, it's bluesy, it's rock, and it's just blue collar music. It's {{a lot about the}} lyrics.

2500|$|The phrase [...] "took me to a Leafs game" [...] {{was used}} as a {{euphemism}} for an attempted male-on-male sexual encounter.

2500|$|On Election Day, {{police were}} called to at least two polling sites in St. Lawrence County {{following}} [...] "overzealous electioneering" [...] by supporters of Hoffman.

2500|$|His {{increased}} profile led {{to contact}} with other individuals, including musicians such as Elton John. John {{at that time was}} trying to assist British performers whom he personally liked to achieve success in the US (he had released records in the US by veteran British pop singer Cliff Richard on his own Rocket label). John tried to give Connolly a boost in America by using him as the opening act on his 1976 US tour. But the well-intentioned gesture was a failure. John's American fans had no interest in being warmed-up by an unknown comedic performer– especially a Scotsman whose accent they found incomprehensible. [...] "In Washington, <b>some</b> <b>guy</b> threw a pipe and it hit me right between my eyes", he told Michael Parkinson two years later. [...] "It wasn't my audience.

2500|$|In 1970, fellow wrestler Bruno Sammartino {{mentioned}} to McMahon that Albano, a mediocre wrestler who was nonetheless an entertaining speaker, {{might be better}} utilized as a manager. In professional wrestling, a manager might be tasked with behind-the-scenes efforts to help push forward a charge's career or handle his booking, but plays an equal or even greater role in the ring, speaking for his charge and helping rile up the crowd for or against him. Sammartino recalled: [...] "One day I said to Vince Sr., this guy [...] isn't the best wrestler, as a team, they [...] can only go so far. But he'd be a great mouthpiece for <b>some</b> <b>guy.</b> Lou has such a gift of gab that he can help out some people. As a wrestler, he just seemed limited. He was always the same. He was never looked upon by promoters as someone who could be anyone special. But as a manager, he shined. That was his calling." [...] Albano, realizing that wrestlers had only a limited lifespan in the ring, and still dealing with his old football injury, agreed. Although it was his decision to split up his ten-year tag team partnership with Altomare, the two remained very close until the latter's death in 2003.|$|E
