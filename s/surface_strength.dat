500|$|As {{the final}} step before their planned {{invasion}} of the Japanese mainland, Allied forces invaded Okinawa on 1 April. The Imperial Japanese Navy's response was to organise a mission codenamed Operation Ten-Go that would see the commitment of much of Japan's remaining <b>surface</b> <b>strength.</b> Yamato and nine escorts (the cruiser [...] and eight destroyers) would sail to Okinawa and, in concert with kamikaze and Okinawa-based army units, attack the Allied forces assembled on and around Okinawa. Yamato would then be beached {{to act as an}} unsinkable gun emplacement and continue to fight until destroyed. In preparation for the mission, Yamato had taken on a full stock of ammunition on 29 March. According to the Japanese plan, the ships were supposed to take aboard only enough fuel for a one way voyage to Okinawa, but additional fuel amounting to 60 percent of capacity was issued on the authority of local base commanders. Designated the [...] "Surface Special Attack Force", the ships left Tokuyama at 15:20 on 6 April.|$|E

50|$|Some inkjet {{papers are}} made from high quality deinked pulp or {{chemical}} pulps. Quality inkjet paper requires good dimensional stability, no curling or cockling, and good <b>surface</b> <b>strength.</b> For most purposes surface smoothness is required. Sufficient and even porosity is required to counteract spreading of the ink. For lower quality printing, uncoated copy paper suffices, but higher grades require coating. The traditional coatings are not widely used for inkjet papers. For matte inkjet papers, {{it is common to}} use silica as pigment together with polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH). Glossy inkjet papers can be made by multicoating, resin coating, or cast coating on a lamination paper.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a non-conventional way of {{additive}} manufacturing, curved-layered printing, {{has been}} applied to large-scale construction process. Despite the number of research works on Curved Layered Fused Deposition Modelling (CLFDM) over the last decade, few practical applications have been reported. An alternative method adopting the CLFDM principle, that generates a curved-layered printing path, was developed using a single scripting environment called Grasshopper – a plugin of Rhinoceros®. The method was evaluated with the 3 D Concrete Printing process developed at Loughborough University. The evaluation of the method including the results of simulation and printing revealed three principal benefits compared with existing flat-layered printing paths, which are particularly beneficial to large-scale AM techniques: (i) better surface quality, (ii) shorter printing time and (iii) higher <b>surface</b> <b>strengths...</b>|$|R

50|$|Surface {{activated}} bonding (SAB) is a {{low temperature}} wafer bonding technology with atomically clean and activated surfaces.

50|$|Concrete can be colored in many ways; color hardener, {{integral}} liquid or powder, acid stains {{to name a}} few. The {{process of}} integrally coloring the concrete offers {{the advantage of the}} entire volume being colored; however, the <b>surface</b> <b>strength</b> is not increased as with the use of color hardener. Dry shake color hardener is another popular way to color concrete. You broadcast the hardener on the concrete as soon as it is floated for the first time. After letting the bleed water soak into the hardener you float and trowel it in. This method only covers the surface about 3/16 of an inch but it gives the concrete surface a longer wear life.|$|E

Two types of woven fiberglass are used to provide the <b>surface</b> <b>strength</b> of the composite sandwich.

50|$|Surface sizing {{solutions}} {{consists of}} mainly modified starches and sometimes other hydrocolloids, such as gelatine, or surface sizing agents such as acrylic co-polymers. Surface sizing agents are amphiphilic molecules, having both hydrophilic (water-loving) and hydrophobic (water-repelling) ends. The sizing agent adheres to substrate fibers and forms a film, with the hydrophilic tail facing the fiber and the hydrophobic tail facing outwards, {{resulting in a}} smooth finish that tends to be water-repellent. Sizing improves the <b>surface</b> <b>strength,</b> printability, and water resistance of the paper or material {{to which it is}} applied. In the sizing solution, optical brightening agents (OBA) may also be added to improve the opacity and whiteness of the paper or material surface.|$|E

An optimized peening temperature of about 310 "C was identified for a 450 "C quenched and tern-pered steel AISI 4140.

The quasi static <b>surface</b> compressive yield <b>strengths</b> {{as well as}} the cyclic <b>surface</b> yield <b>strengths</b> were determined from residual stress relaxation tests conducted at different stress amplitudes and numbers of loading cycles. Dynamic and static strain aging effects acting during and after warm peening clearly increased the residual stress stability and the alternating bending strength for all material states. ...|$|R
