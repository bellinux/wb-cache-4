5|$|Candidate state {{reptiles}} are not {{assured of}} making it through the legislative process. In Minnesota, 1998 and 1999 bills proposing the Blanding's turtle were unsuccessful. In Pennsylvania in 2009, the House passed an eastern box turtle bill which died in the Senate without a vote. Virginia proponents of the eastern box turtle have seen 1999 and 2009 bids fail. For the most recent attempt, a legislative opponent of the turtle <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> cowardly for the state because of its defensive shell, and suggested the rattlesnake {{would be a better}} representative. The turtle also drew scorn for often perishing on roads, but its most serious problem was a too-close association with bordering state, North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Development of the {{sandwich}} began in 2001 {{in response to}} several major factors. After an overall sales decline of 17% coupled with a profit decline of 29%, Burger King {{held a series of}} consumer tests that showed the company's customer base was looking for a wider variety of options when making purchases. Additional survey results revealed that a lack of newer products was discouraging consumers from visiting the chain. Furthermore, the company was seeking to counter the threat to its sales by newer fast casual restaurants that had begun to bite into sales. By July 2002, the chain had sold nearly fifty million of {{the sandwich}}es, eventually displacing the BK Broiler's initial launch figures as the company's best selling product introduction. The successful introduction of the Chicken Whopper {{was one of the few}} noted positive highlights of the company during negotiations for the sale of Burger King by its then owner Diageo to a group of investors led by the TPG Capital; Chicago-based consulting firm Technomic Inc. President Ron Paul was quoted that he was encouraged by recent product changes at Burger King such as the new Chicken Whopper, but he <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> early to tell whether the changes have been successful. Despite the Chicken Whopper's initial success, just over a year after the its introduction, enthusiasm for the product was waning; Burger King's largest franchisee, Carrols Corporation, was complaining that the product line was a failure, describing the sandwich as a pedestrian product with a great name.|$|E

Some analysts theorised the Russians may also have wanted to prevent foreign countries from accessing the debris which had been classified as state secrets. They decided to destroy the remains where they lay and blew up the remnants of the bow in September 2002.|$|E

On the same day, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan and British Prime Minister Tony Blair called for an international force {{to be sent to}} Lebanon to stop Hezbollah from attacking Israel. But Israel <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> soon to talk about deploying an international force.|$|E
25|$|On 29 October 1914, {{after the}} pursuit of Goeben and Breslau, Breslau bombarded the Russian Black Sea port of Theodosia. On 30 October the High Command in Istanbul changed the force distribution. On 2 November Grand Vizier Said Halim Pasha {{expressed}} regret to the Allies {{for the actions of}} the navy. Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Sazonov <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> late and that Russia considered the raid an act of war. The Cabinet tried to explain that hostilities were begun without its sanction by German officers serving in the navy. The Allies insisted on reparations to Russia, the dismissal of German officers from the Goeben and Breslau, and the internment of the German ships {{until the end of the}} war, but before the Ottoman government could respond, Great Britain and France declared war on the Ottoman Empire on 5 November. The Ottoman Committee of Union and Progress's official Declaration of War came on 14 November.|$|E
25|$|He {{began his}} formal {{education}} at the Barmen Gymnasium. From 1910 to 1914, he attended the University of Jena, intending to write a thesis in physics. But he also studied carefully Kant's Critique of Pure Reason during a course taught by Bruno Bauch, {{and was one of}} very few students to attend Gottlob Frege's courses in mathematical logic. While Carnap held moral and political opposition to World War I, he felt obligated to serve in the German army. After three years of service, he was given permission to study physics at the University of Berlin, 1917–18, where Albert Einstein was a newly appointed professor. Carnap then attended the University of Jena, where he wrote a thesis defining an axiomatic theory of space and time. The physics department <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> philosophical, and Bruno Bauch of the philosophy department said it was pure physics. Carnap then wrote another thesis in 1921, with Bauch's supervision, on the theory of space in a more orthodox Kantian style, and published as Der Raum ("Space") in a supplemental issue of Kant-Studien (1922). In it he makes the clear distinction between formal, physical and perceptual (e.g., visual) spaces.|$|E

500|$|When Dean Winters {{departed}} from the show and a permanent replacement for the Brian Cassidy character was needed, Hurd had trouble convincing network officials she was correct for the part. Ted Kotcheff, the show's co-executive producer, <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> redundant to have two man-woman sets of partners, with protagonists Elliot Stabler and Olivia Benson already partnered together. Kotcheff felt Munch and Jeffries pairing diluted the relationship of Stabler and Benson {{because it was a}} [...] "mirror image" [...] of their partnership. Although Hurd felt more female characters should be part of a sex crimes unit, she said, [...] "I understand the industry, and what networks want, and they wanted someone to have an impact, a rating." [...] The producers had discussions about removing Jeffries from the show so that Benson would be the only woman in the squad room, but no decisions were ever made.|$|E
500|$|GCC members {{questioned}} {{the efficacy of}} climate change denial and shifted their message to highlighting the economic costs of proposed greenhouse gas emission regulations and the limited effectiveness of proposals exempting developing nations. In 1995, after the United Nations Climate Change conference in Berlin agreed to negotiate greenhouse gas emission limits, GCC's executive director said the agreement gave [...] "developing countries like China, India and Mexico a free ride" [...] and would [...] "change the relations between sovereign countries and the United Nations. This could have very significant implications. It could {{be a way of}} capping our economy." [...] At a Washington, D.C. press conference {{on the eve of the}} second United Nations Climate Change conference in Geneva, GCC's executive director said, [...] "The time for decision is not yet now." [...] At the conference in Geneva, GCC issued a statement that <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> early to determine the causes of global warming. GCC representatives lobbied scientists at the September, 1996 IPCC conference in Mexico City.|$|E

Slide to Play Eaves was also troubled by the controls, and recommended the iPad version for the extra screen space. Pocket Gamer Slater <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> easy to clear the board with three-letter words, and thus that the design execution was not as robust as the concept, never being [...] "more {{than the sum of}} its strange combination of parts". While TouchArcade Troy Woodfield called the gameplay [...] "not ... totally original" [...] in how it combines three common game ideas, he still found the combination [...] "a stroke of genius", and highly recommended the game as [...] "a breath of fresh air". Brown of VideoGamer.com agreed that Puzzlejuice distinguished itself from the crowded iOS puzzle game genre, and Slide to Play Eaves called its balance between game types [...] "perfect".|$|E

500|$|Four singles were {{released}} from the album. The lead single, [...] "Through the Rain" [...] was released on September 24, 2002. It received mixed reviews from critics, some of whom <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> similar to her earlier ballads, such as [...] "Hero" [...] and [...] "Outside", while others praised Carey's vocals in the song. It was one of Carey's poorest-selling US singles, reaching number 81 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. However, it topped the Hot Dance Club Play charts and reached the top twenty of the Adult Contemporary chart. Outside the US, the single performed moderately, peaking within the top ten in Canada, Switzerland, Sweden, Italy and the UK, and within the top 20 in Ireland, Australia, Norway and Denmark. The music video of [...] "Through the Rain", directed by Daver Meyers, {{is based on the}} courtship and eloping of Carey's parents. Scenes of Carey singing in a street when rain starts to fall are juxtaposed with the story of a mixed-race couple who run away from their families, who oppose their relationship.|$|E
500|$|Hollywood.com writer Eric Sundermann {{enjoyed the}} new {{direction}} Ann's character was taking, {{as well as}} how [...] "Harvest Festival" [...] accurately portrays small-town life. Rick Porter of Zap2it said the episode [...] "put a great cap on the first portion of the season". He called Andy and April [...] "a recipe for excellent comedy" [...] and called the slowly developing romance of Ben and Leslie extremely rewarding. Andy Daglas of ChicagoNow called it a [...] "pure delight from beginning to end" [...] and a good entry point for newcomers to the show. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club called the episode [...] "celebration of the whackjobs that live in Pawnee and how their singular focus can make for some adorably naive comedy". While he praised the main subplot, he <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> early in April and Andy's relationship for them to declare their love for each other, and said April's declaration [...] "came out of nowhere". Matt Fowler of IGN said it was not his favorite episode, as the jokes about Ben's past felt repetitive compared to past episodes, and the April and Andy subplot [...] "fell a little flat". However, he said it was [...] "chock full of dozens of little moments that make the entire episode worthwhile", and particularly praised the Native American curse and the parody of the media.|$|E
500|$|McCain reached Hỏa Lò in as bad a {{physical}} condition as any prisoner during the war. His captors {{refused to give}} him medical care unless he gave them military information; they beat and interrogated him, but McCain only offered his name, rank, serial number, and date of birth (the only information he was required to provide under the Geneva Conventions and permitted to give under the U.S. Code of Conduct). Soon thinking he was near death, McCain said he would give them more information if taken to the hospital, hoping he could then put his interrogators off once he was treated. A prison doctor came and <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> late, as McCain was about to die anyway. Only when the North Vietnamese discovered {{that his father was}} a high-ranking admiral did they give him medical care, calling him [...] "the crown prince". [...] Two days after McCain's plane went down, that event and his status as a POW made the front pages of The New York Times and The Washington Post. Interrogation and beatings resumed in the hospital; McCain gave the North Vietnamese his ship's name, squadron's name, and the attack's intended target. This information, along with personal details of McCain's life and purported statements by McCain about the war's progress, would appear over the next two weeks in the North Vietnamese official newspaper Nhân Dân as well as in dispatches from outlets such as the Cuban news agency Prensa Latina. [...] Disclosing the military information was in violation of the Code of Conduct, which McCain later wrote he regretted, although he saw the information as being of no practical use to the North Vietnamese. Further coerced to give future targets, he named cities that had already been bombed, and responding to demands for the names of his squadron's members, he supplied instead the names of the Green Bay Packers' offensive line.|$|E
