40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} the efficiency {{implications for the}} licensing process of university inventions when firms can use the <b>secrecy</b> <b>device.</b> Secrecy is a confidential agreement used by the firms {{to learn about the}} quality of inventions prior to licensing. I use a bargaining model with one-side private information to analyze {{the extent to which the}} <b>secrecy</b> <b>device</b> improves the efficiency of the licensing process. The decision to enter a secrecy agreement is determined by the uncertainty about the underlying quality of inventions. The bargaining model assumes that the university/inventor has private information about the value of invention and that firms use secrecies as costly device to guarantee the quality of the invention. The main results show that the <b>secrecy</b> <b>device</b> increases the efficiency of the licensing process and that the gains in efficiency are proportional with the difference between the established firm’s cost of production and the inventor’s cost of production...|$|E
40|$|My thesis {{analyzes}} {{the process of}} licensing university inventions by start-up and established firms. In particular, the licensing procedure {{involves the use of}} secrecies, which are confidential agreements used by firms to learn about the quality of invention. My first two chapters of the thesis describe the quality characteristics of the secrecy agreements and analyze the efficiency implications of the <b>secrecy</b> <b>device.</b> In my last chapter, I describe the differences in licensing behavior between start-up and established firms with respect to the invention's stages of development. I use a unique data set based on licensing activity at University of California, San Diego. I match this data set with the grant data obtained from the Office of Contracts and Grant, UCSD for the period 1986 - 2003. I find that secrecy agreements can be used by firms as a contemporaneous measure of invention's quality, in their licensing decision. In addition, the <b>secrecy</b> <b>device</b> enhances weakly the efficiency of the licensing secrecy and the gains in welfare are proportional with the difference in production cost of established firm and the inventor. In my last chapter I find that the odds ratio of licensing by start- ups relative to licensing by established firms is lower for more advanced stage inventions. This result can be used to analyze other complex issues regarding the licensing process, like efficiency and the role of asymmetric information in start-up formatio...|$|E

In particular, the results obtained from the formal analysis of the smart card security protocols when smart cards are used as a specific type of Secure Signature Creation Devices (SSCDs) are presented. SSCDs are developed to support the EU-directive on electronic signatures. In this paper, we focus on security properties, called the authentication and <b>secrecy.</b> The <b>device</b> authentication protocols mentioned in CWA 14890 - 1 are modeled using the high-level protocol specification language HLPSL and verified with the help of AVISPA tool. Our formal analysis does not reveal any weaknesses of the CWA 14890 - 1 protocol suite...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe study {{a simple}} {{electronic}} boardroom voting system. While most existing systems rely on opaque electronic devices, a scientific committee {{of a research}} institute (the CNRS Section 07) has recently proposed an alternative system. Despite its simplicity (in particular, no use of cryptography), each voter can check that {{the outcome of the}} election corresponds to the votes, without having to trust the devices. In this paper, we present three versions of this system, exhibiting potential attacks. We then formally model the system in the applied pi-calculus, and prove that two versions ensure both vote correctness (even if the devices are corrupted) and ballot <b>secrecy</b> (assuming the <b>devices</b> are honest) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The angular {{distribution}} of Compton scattering of two quanta {{originating in the}} annihilation of a positron with an electron is investigated as a quantum key distribution (QKD) mechanism in the gamma spectral range. The geometry of coincident Compton scattering is observed on the two sides {{as a way to}} obtain partially correlated readings on the quantum channel. We derive the noise probability density function of a conceptually equivalent prepare and measure quantum channel in order to evaluate the limits of the concept in terms of the <b>device</b> <b>secrecy</b> capacity and estimate it at roughly 1. 9 bits per 1 000 annihilation events. The high error rate is well above the tolerable error rates of the common reconciliation protocols; therefore, the proposed key agreement protocol by public discussion requires key reconciliation using classical error-correcting codes. We constructed a prototype device based on the readily available monolithic detectors in the least complex setup. Keywords—Compton scattering, gamma-ray polarization, quantum cryptography, quantum key distribution I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we propose a {{complete}} solution of authentication and key exchange for digital home environments such that mobile devices can securely access the home devices. Some digital home authentication and key exchange protocols performed between mobile devices and home gateways are assisted by the AAA servers, which are provided by telecommunication companies, but they have some security flaws. In our proposed protocol, the necessary security requirements for digital home security mechanisms are satisfied, such as mutual authentication, authenticated key exchange, and forward secrecy. In our digital home security scheme, a mobile device can authenticate his home gateway and exchange a session key with each home device without pre-sharing keys with the home gateway and with the home device. The proposed authentication and key exchange protocol can also cooperate with the AAA server. Furthermore, we propose another authentication and key exchange protocol with forward <b>secrecy</b> between mobile <b>devices</b> and home devices. The computation capabilities of the mobile devices also are considered in our proposed protocols, where we only employ symmetric encryption/decryption and low-cost operations in order to reach the aim of light-weight computation cost...|$|R
