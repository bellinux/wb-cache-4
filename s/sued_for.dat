5000|$|Before PATRIOT, in {{addition}} to being able to <b>sue</b> <b>for</b> money damages, you could <b>sue</b> <b>for</b> declaratory relief from a judge. For example, an Internet service provider could ask the court to declare that a particular type of wiretapping that the government wants to do on its network is illegal. One could also <b>sue</b> <b>for</b> an injunction from the court, ordering that any illegal wiretapping stop. PATRIOT section 223 significantly reduced a judge's ability to remedy unlawful surveillance, making it so you can only <b>sue</b> the government <b>for</b> money damages. This means, for example, that no one could sue the government to stop an ongoing illegal wiretap. At best, one could <b>sue</b> <b>for</b> the government to pay damages while the illegal tap continued! ...|$|R
