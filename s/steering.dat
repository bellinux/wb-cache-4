5|$|BMW {{began to}} use precise rack and pinion <b>steering</b> systems in the 1930s, and many other European {{manufacturers}} soon adopted the technology. American automakers adopted rack and pinion <b>steering</b> beginning with the 1974 Ford Pinto.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary control}} input that the rider can make {{is to apply}} a torque {{directly}} to the <b>steering</b> mechanism via the handlebars. Because of the bike's own dynamics, due to <b>steering</b> geometry and gyroscopic effects, direct position control over <b>steering</b> angle {{has been found to}} be problematic.|$|E
5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} how easy or difficult a bike {{will be to}} ride is trail, the distance that the front wheel ground contact point trails behind the <b>steering</b> axis ground contact point. The <b>steering</b> axis is the axis about which the entire <b>steering</b> mechanism (fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) pivots. In traditional bike designs, with a <b>steering</b> axis tilted back from the vertical, positive trail tends to steer the front wheel into {{the direction of a}} lean, independent of forward speed. This can be simulated by pushing a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side. In a lean, gravity provides this force. The dynamics of a moving bike are more complicated, however, and other factors can contribute to or detract from this effect.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor that}} can also {{contribute}} to the self-stability of traditional bike designs is the distribution of mass in the <b>steering</b> mechanism, which includes the front wheel, the fork, and the handlebar. If the center of mass for the <b>steering</b> mechanism is in front of the <b>steering</b> axis, then the pull of gravity will also cause the front wheel to steer {{in the direction of a}} lean. This can be seen by leaning a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side independent of any interaction with the ground. Additional parameters, such as the fore-to-aft position of the center of mass and the elevation of the center of mass {{also contribute to the}} dynamic behavior of a bike.|$|E
5|$|Between the {{extremes}} of bicycles with classical front-wheel <b>steering</b> and those with strictly rear-wheel <b>steering</b> is a class of bikes with a pivot point somewhere between the two, referred to as center-steering, and similar to articulated <b>steering.</b> An early implementation of the concept was the Phantom bicycle in the early 1870s promoted as a safer alternative to the penny-farthing. This design allows for simple front-wheel drive and current implementations appear to be quite stable, even rideable no-hands, as many photographs illustrate.|$|E
5|$|Both {{tracks and}} wheels {{were used for}} <b>steering.</b> The <b>steering</b> system was set up so that gentle turns used just the {{steerable}} front wheels, but brakes would {{be applied to the}} tracks the farther the <b>steering</b> wheel was turned. The drive sprocket had the track-saving but more complicated rollers rather than the more common teeth. The rear suspension consisted of five double roadwheels, overlapping and interleaved in the Schachtellaufwerk layout, mounted on swing arms sprung by torsion bars. An idler wheel, mounted {{at the rear of the}} vehicle, was used to control track tension. The front axle had transversely mounted leaf springs and shock absorbers - the only ones on the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|Both {{tracks and}} wheels {{were used for}} <b>steering.</b> The <b>steering</b> system was set up so that shallow turns used only the wheels, but brakes would {{be applied to the}} tracks the farther the <b>steering</b> wheel was turned. The drive {{sprocket}} had rollers rather than the more common teeth. The rear suspension consisted of six double roadwheels, overlapping and interleaved in the usual Schachtellaufwerk system used for German half-track vehicles, mounted on swing arms sprung by torsion bars. An idler wheel, mounted {{at the rear of the}} vehicle, was used to control track tension. The front wheels had leaf springs and shock absorbers.|$|E
5|$|Keith Code built a {{motorcycle}} with fixed handlebars {{to investigate the}} effects of rider motion and position on <b>steering.</b>|$|E
5|$|Players can utilize Kinect to {{look into}} a corner using a new head {{tracking}} feature. This allows them to look toward the apex of a corner or at nearby cars. The controller or <b>steering</b> wheel is used to control the car while Kinect is used independently for viewing around the driver. Players can also use Kinect as a game controller. In this setting the game automatically accelerates and decelerates the player's vehicle utilizing {{a modified version of}} the feature known as Auto Brake in Forza Motorsport 3. The <b>steering</b> is controlled by placing the players arms out as if controlling an invisible <b>steering</b> wheel. Kinect will allow the player to use voice commands to start races and navigate menus.|$|E
5|$|Sadasivan {{also served}} as President of the Singapore Indian Development Association (SINDA) and the Singapore Indian Education Trust, Chairman of the Indian Heritage Centre <b>Steering</b> Committee {{and a member of}} the National Art Gallery Implementation <b>Steering</b> Committee, Chairman of the National HIV/AIDS Policy Committee, a member of the National <b>Steering</b> Committee on Racial and Religious Harmony, an advisor to the Tamil Language Council and the People's Association Indian Activity Executive Committee Co-ordinating Council, a member of the Singapore Industrial and Services Employees' Union Council of Advisors, and Honorary Advisor to the Singapore Furniture Industries Council. In addition, he was an honorary member of the Singapore Medical Association.|$|E
5|$|Sadasivan {{also served}} as President of the Singapore Indian Development Association (from March 2009) and the Singapore Indian Education Trust, Chairman of the Indian Heritage Centre <b>Steering</b> Committee {{and a member of}} the National Art Gallery Implementation <b>Steering</b> Committee, Chairman of the National HIV/AIDS Policy Committee, a member of the National <b>Steering</b> Committee on Racial and Religious Harmony, an advisor to the Tamil Language Council and the People's Association Indian Activity Executive Committee Co-ordinating Council, a member of the Singapore Industrial and Services Employees' Union Council of Advisors, and Honorary Advisor to the Singapore Furniture Industries Council. On 8 May 2010, he was made an honorary member of the Singapore Medical Association.|$|E
5|$|Several effects {{influence}} the <b>steering</b> angle, the angle {{at which the}} front assembly is rotated about the <b>steering</b> axis, necessary to maintain a steady-state turn. Some of these are unique to single-track vehicles, while others are also experienced by automobiles. Some of these may be mentioned elsewhere in this article, and they are repeated here, though not necessarily in order of importance, {{so that they may}} be found in one place.|$|E
5|$|<b>Steering</b> may be {{supplied}} by a rider or, under certain circumstances, by the bike itself. This self-stability {{is generated by}} a combination of several effects that depend on the geometry, mass distribution, and forward speed of the bike. Tires, suspension, <b>steering</b> damping, and frame flex can also influence it, especially in motorcycles.|$|E
5|$|The DBRS9 {{was made}} {{available}} to consumers and included an adjustable driver's seat and <b>steering.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{acceleration}} {{index is}} the ratio between <b>steering</b> torque and lateral or centripetal acceleration.|$|E
5|$|The {{magazines}} for the 4.5-inch {{guns and}} the <b>steering</b> gear both lay outside the armoured citadel and {{had their own}} armour. The magazines had four-inch roofs and sides, with three-inch ends while the <b>steering</b> gear also had a four-inch roof, but only three-inch sides and ends.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} type of Mycenaean vessel based on depictions of {{contemporary}} art was the oared galley with long and narrow hulls. The shape of the hull was constructed in a way to maximize the number of rowers. Thus, a higher speed could have been achieved regardless of wind conditions. Although it carried mast and sail, it was less efficient as a sailing ship. The Mycenaean galley offered certain advantages. Although lighter compared to the oared-sailing ship of the Minoans of Crete, it seated more rowers. Its <b>steering</b> mechanism was a triangular <b>steering</b> oar, a forerunner of the latter <b>steering</b> oar of Archaic era.|$|E
5|$|The roll {{index is}} the ratio between <b>steering</b> torque and roll or lean angle.|$|E
5|$|The ship's <b>steering</b> was by a contrabalanced rudder (black, at {{left in the}} picture), {{with its}} {{associated}} <b>steering</b> gear located in a compartment (green in the picture) above the rudder and below the aft structure. Steam-powered generators provided electric power for radios, navigation equipment, refrigeration compressors, pumps, lighting, and degaussing. An evaporator produced fresh water for the boilers and for the crew.|$|E
5|$|The <b>steering</b> is {{rack and}} pinion with {{electric}} power assistance.|$|E
5|$|Third, {{because the}} front and rear tires can have {{different}} slip angles due to weight distribution, tire properties, etc., bikes can experience understeer or oversteer. When understeering, the <b>steering</b> angle must be greater, and when oversteering, the <b>steering</b> angle must be less than it would be if the slip angles were equal to maintain a given turn radius. Some authors even use the term counter-steering to refer to the need on some bikes under some conditions to steer in the opposite direction of the turn (negative <b>steering</b> angle) to maintain control in response to significant rear wheel slippage.|$|E
5|$|A {{measurement}} {{similar to}} trail, called either mechanical trail, normal trail, or true trail, is the perpendicular {{distance from the}} <b>steering</b> axis to the centroid of the front wheel contact patch.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} salvo from the 15cm {{batteries}} in Drøbak, the <b>steering</b> {{from the bridge}} was disabled. Blücher had just passed Drøbakgrunnen (Drøbak shallows) and was in a turn to port. The commander got her back on track by using the side shafts, but she lost speed. Normally the rudder is controlled electrically from the bridge to the motors forward of the Handsteuerraum (hand <b>steering</b> room) deep under the armored deck, forward of the rudder. In an emergency it can be switched within seconds to manual <b>steering,</b> but orders from the bridge to the rudder may be delayed. At 04:34 Norwegian land-based torpedo batteries scored two hits on the ship. The targeting device in the torpedo battery was very primitive. The speed of the torpedo was known and set, but {{the speed of the}} target had to be adjusted by dead reckoning (guessing).|$|E
5|$|An {{introduction}} to the series is the Pilot Assist feature. Intended for players new to the series, it is a passive auto-piloting feature that assists players by nudging {{them away from the}} edges of the track or from walls, though its effects at higher speed settings are less desirable. Wipeout HD allows players to control their craft by using the motion-sensitive features of the PlayStation's Sixaxis controller. Motion control comes in two variants: pitch and <b>steering,</b> or pitch only. The former allows the craft to be totally controlled by moving the controller, while the latter only allows the nose of the craft to be raised or lowered by motion control, with the <b>steering</b> either controlled by analogue stick or D-pad.|$|E
5|$|Available options include; 17-inch 5-spoke forged polished-aluminum wheels; {{rearview}} camera system, parking assist package; leather-wrapped <b>steering</b> wheel; {{and heated}} leather front seats with selectable automatic activation.|$|E
5|$|Corzine {{has participated}} in {{meetings}} of the Bilderberg Group, a network of leaders {{in the fields of}} politics, business, and banking, from 1995–1997, 1999, 2003 and 2004. He is {{a former member of the}} group's <b>Steering</b> Committee.|$|E
5|$|During {{a couple}} of the Svea flights, Andrée tested and tried out the drag-rope <b>steering</b> {{technique}} which he had developed and wanted to use on his projected North Pole expedition. Drag ropes, which hang from the balloon basket and drag part of their length on the ground, are designed to counteract the tendency of lighter-than-air craft to travel at the same speed as the wind, a situation that makes <b>steering</b> by sails impossible. The friction of the ropes was intended to slow the balloon {{to the point where the}} sails would have an effect (beyond that of making the balloon rotate on its axis). Andrée reported, and presumably believed, that with drag rope/sails <b>steering</b> he had succeeded in deviating about ten degrees either way from the wind direction. This notion is rejected by modern balloonists; the Swedish Ballooning Association maintains that Andrée's belief that he had deviated from the wind was mistaken, being misled by inexpertise and a surfeit of enthusiasm in an environment of variable winds and poor visibility. Use of drag ropes (prone to snapping, falling off, or becoming entangled with each other or the ground, in addition to being ineffective) is not considered by any modern expert to be a useful <b>steering</b> technique.|$|E
5|$|For other {{problems}} {{so long as}} power is available for the braking and <b>steering</b> system, the vehicle can be conventionally towed subject to instructions in the owner's manual. Using the car to tow trailers is not recommended.|$|E
5|$|If enough {{moisture}} exists, thunderstorms {{can form}} along sea breeze fronts that then can send out outflow boundaries. This causes chaotic wind/pressure regimes if the <b>steering</b> flow is weak. Like all other surface features, sea breeze fronts lie inside troughs of low pressure.|$|E
5|$|If the <b>steering</b> of a bike is locked, {{it becomes}} {{virtually}} impossible to balance while riding. On the other hand, if the gyroscopic effect of rotating bike wheels is cancelled by adding counter-rotating wheels, it is still easy to balance while riding. One other way that a bike can be balanced, with or without locked <b>steering,</b> is by applying appropriate torques between the bike and rider {{similar to the way}} a gymnast can swing up from hanging straight down on uneven parallel bars, a person can start swinging on a swing from rest by pumping their legs, or a double inverted pendulum can be controlled with an actuator only at the elbow.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Kooijman, et al., {{published}} an article in Science showing that neither gyroscopic effects nor so-called caster effects due to trail are necessary for a bike to balance itself. They designed a two-mass-skate bicycle that the equations of motion predict is self-stable even with negative trail, the front wheel contacts {{the ground in front}} of the <b>steering</b> axis, and with counter-rotating wheels to cancel any gyroscopic effects. Then they constructed a physical model to validate that prediction. This may require some of the details provided below about <b>steering</b> geometry or stability to be re-evaluated. Bicycle dynamics was named 26 of Discovers 100 top stories of 2011.|$|E
5|$|Installing such a {{large engine}} in a {{relatively}} small vehicle required some modifications, although the exterior sheet metal remained {{essentially the same as}} the Alpine's. Necessary chassis modifications included moving from the Burman recirculating ball <b>steering</b> mechanism to a more modern rack and pinion system.|$|E
5|$|Internal forces, {{those between}} {{components}} of the bike and rider system, are mostly caused by the rider or by friction. In addition to pedaling, the rider can apply torques between the <b>steering</b> mechanism (front fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) and rear frame, and between the rider and the rear frame. Friction exists between any parts that move against each other: in the drive train, between the <b>steering</b> mechanism and the rear frame, etc. In addition to brakes, which create friction between rotating wheels and non-rotating frame parts, many bikes have front and rear suspensions. Some motorcycles and bicycles have a <b>steering</b> damper to dissipate undesirable kinetic energy, and some bicycles have a spring connecting the front fork to the frame to provide a progressive torque that tends to steer the bicycle straight ahead. On bikes with rear suspensions, feedback between the drive train and the suspension is an issue designers attempt to handle with various linkage configurations and dampers.|$|E
5|$|International: sedans and Sportwagons entered {{production}} in mid-March 2009. Internationals are appointed with launch VE Calais V alloy wheels, front foglamps, a six-disc CD changer, leather upholstered trim and <b>steering</b> wheel, Bluetooth connectivity and rear park assist. Holden reintroduced the International in October 2009. Offered in sedan and Sportwagon body styles, the second iteration was fitted with the 3.0-litre SIDI V6 engine and six-speed automatic transmission; a 3.6-litre LPG Alloytec V6 engine with four-speed automatic transmission option {{was available for}} the sedan only. Extra features include 18-inch alloy wheels, Berlina front grille, leather seat trim and <b>steering</b> wheel, Bluetooth connectivity and rear park assist for the sedan (already standard on Sportwagons).|$|E
5|$|Lacking firm {{movement}} {{because of}} weak <b>steering</b> currents, Gordon meandered north-northeast {{in the presence}} of mild west-southwesterly wind shear, unable to strengthen under the adverse conditions. By November 11, a trough prodded Gordon to the north-northeast at 8mph (13km/h), and it strengthened by 6mph (9km/h) as it moved through the central Caribbean Sea. The trough continued <b>steering</b> Gordon, bending it eastward towards Jamaica on the afternoon on November 12. Despite the warm waters, Gordon did not strengthen that day as strong upper-tropospheric shear hindered development, disorganized the upper level circulation, and reduced its winds to 40mph (65km/h).|$|E
5|$|Minor {{changes for}} the 2014 model year include a manual release for the charge port door {{in place of the}} {{electronically}} activated door found on previous models, and the addition of two new paint colors. A leather wrapped <b>steering</b> wheel becomes standard.|$|E
