5|$|The Mise of Lewes {{was signed}} {{on the day}} of Montfort's victory at the Battle of Lewes, though it is not known whether it {{happened}} during or after the battle. Neither are the terms of the document known, though it <b>seems</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> they involved conditions for further negotiations. These efforts at a permanent settlement fell through, however, and the support for Montfort's government gradually eroded. Henry's oldest son, Edward – the later King Edward Istarted a military campaign that ended in the Battle of Evesham in August 1265, where Earl Simon was defeated and killed. Parts of the baronial resistance still held out, {{but by the end of}} 1266 the final besieged garrison at Kenilworth Castle surrendered. The rebels were given pardons according to terms set out in the Dictum of Kenilworth.|$|E
5|$|Troglita did {{not remain}} inactive: from Carthage, the praetorian prefect Athanasius and Troglita's young son {{organized}} reinforcements and {{supplies for the}} camp at Laribus, while Troglita himself succeeded not only in reconciling Cutzinas and Isfidaias, but also in gaining the allegiance of King Iaudas and his tribe. In the spring of 548, Troglita, having regrouped his forces, met with his Moorish allies at the plain of Arsuris on the northern limits of Byzacena. Corippus gives extraordinary numbers for the native contingents provided by each chief: 30,000 for Cutzinas, 100,000 for Isfidaias, and 12,000 under Iaudas's brother. Whatever the real numbers, it <b>seems</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Troglita's regular troops formed the lesser portion of the imperial army.|$|E

5|$|Philip {{probably}} also campaigned in Thrace in late 352 BC, possibly {{after returning to}} Macedon from Thessaly. At this point, if not before, Philip defeated Amadokos and subjugated him, and possibly also expelled Cetriporis from his client kingship. During the campaign, Philip's army reached deep into Kersebleptes' territory and laid siege to the fortress of Heraion Teichos located somewhere near Perinthos, {{on the coast of}} the Propontis (although Buckler places this siege in 353 BC). On learning of the siege, the Athenians voted to dispatch 40 triremes to oppose Philip. However, they then heard that Philip had died (or had been taken ill), so the relief mission never actually sailed. It <b>seems</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Philip did fall ill during the campaign, but exactly how the campaign ended is unclear. It was probably at this time that Philip took Kersebleptes' son as a hostage to Pella, effectively ending Kersebleptes' freedom of action.|$|E
5|$|Anne was the {{daughter}} of Thomas Boleyn, later Earl of Wiltshire and Earl of Ormond, and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Howard, daughter of Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk. Thomas Boleyn was a well respected diplomat with a gift for languages; he was also a favourite of King Henry VII, who sent him on many diplomatic missions abroad. Anne and her siblings grew up at Hever Castle in Kent. However, the siblings were born in Norfolk at the Boleyn home at Blickling. A lack of parish records from the period has made it impossible to establish Anne's date of birth. Contemporary evidence is contradictory, with several dates having been put forward by various historians. An Italian, writing in 1600, suggested that she had been born in 1499, while Sir Thomas More's son-in-law, William Roper, indicated a much later date of 1512. Her birth was most likely sometime between 1501 and 1507. As with Anne herself, it is uncertain when her two siblings were born, but it <b>seems</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> her sister Mary was older than Anne. Mary's children clearly believed their mother had been the elder sister. Most historians now agree that Mary was born in 1499. Mary's grandson claimed the Ormonde title in 1596 on the basis she was the elder daughter, which Elizabeth I accepted. Their brother George was born around 1504.|$|E
5|$|Thermopylae {{is arguably}} the most famous battle in European ancient history, {{repeatedly}} referenced in ancient, recent, and contemporary culture. In Western culture at least, it is the Greeks who are lauded for their performance in battle. However, {{within the context of the}} Persian invasion, Thermopylae was undoubtedly a defeat for the Greeks. It <b>seems</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the Greek strategy was to hold off the Persians at Thermopylae and Artemisium; whatever they may have intended, it was presumably not their desire to surrender all of Boeotia and Attica to the Persians. The Greek position at Thermopylae, despite being massively outnumbered, was nearly impregnable. If the position had been held for even a little longer, the Persians might have had to retreat for lack of food and water. Thus, despite the heavy losses, forcing the pass was strategically a Persian victory, but the successful retreat of the bulk of the Greek troops was in its own sense a victory as well. The battle itself had showed what a few free men, willing to do anything for victory against the invaders, could accomplish, and the defeat at Thermopylae had turned Leonidas and the men under his command into martyrs. That boosted the morale of all Greek soldiers in the second Persian invasion.|$|E

25|$|Though {{the actual}} source Shakespeare used {{has not yet}} been determined, it <b>seems</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Shakespeare's Ariel and his {{relationship}} with Prospero reflects more closely the Renaissance idea of a neutral spirit under the control of a magician than the religious idea of a sprite. Shakespeare, however, refuses to make Ariel a will-less character, infusing him with desires and near-human feelings uncharacteristic of most sprites of this type.|$|E
25|$|Many {{scholars}} {{think these}} numbers are exaggerated (records are inadequate, they are much larger than those from similar societies, soldiers were paid {{by the number of}} enemies they killed and the Han dynasty had an interest in exaggerating the bloodiness of the age before China was unified). Regardless of exaggeration, it <b>seems</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> warfare had become excessive during this period. The bloodshed and misery of the Warring States period goes a long way in explaining China's traditional preference for a united throne.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of whether or not salsa is anything more than Cuban music has been argued over for more than thirty years. Initially, not much difference could be seen.

It also <b>seems</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> salsa has receded from the great position it achieved in the late 1970s. The reasons for this are also much disputed.|$|E

25|$|The {{ordinary}} {{correlation between}} beneficiaries' rights and trustees' duties which arises in fixed trusts is absent in discretionary trusts.

However, it <b>seems</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the trustees' duty is limited to (a) determining whether to exercise their discretion, and (b) exercising their discretion lawfully {{under the terms of}} the trust. Whilst the beneficiaries will have standing to sue the trustees for failing to fulfill their duties, it is not clear that they would gain by such action.|$|E
25|$|This naming {{convention}} led to much {{confusion in the}} early 20th century, as scholars debated whether Teotihuacan or Tula-Hidalgo was the Tollan described by 16th-century chronicles.

In the Mesoamerican concept of urbanism, Tollan and other language equivalents serve as a metaphor, linking the bundles of reeds and rushes that formed part of the lacustrine environment of the Valley of Mexico and the large gathering of people in a city.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the works}} which bear the names of Bakhtin's close friends V. N. Vološinov and P. N.

These claims originated in the early 1970s and received their earliest full articulation in English in Clark and Holquist's 1984 biography of Bakhtin. In the years since then, however, most scholars have come to agree that Vološinov and Medvedev ought to be considered the true authors of these works. Although Bakhtin undoubtedly influenced these scholars and may even have had a hand in composing the works attributed to them, it now <b>seems</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> if it was necessary to attribute authorship of these works to one person, Vološinov and Medvedev respectively should receive credit.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the authorship}} {{proposed}} by Zetzner remains unverifiable {{due to the}} nature of publication, the various age of the works, and the practice of attributing authorship without modern methods of citation.

25|$|Uruk {{went through}} several phases of growth, from the Early Uruk period (4000–3500BC) to the Late Uruk period (3500–3100BC). The city was formed when two smaller Ubaid {{settlements}} merged. The temple complexes at their cores became the Eanna District and the Anu District dedicated to Inanna and Anu, respectively. The Anu District was originally called 'Kullaba' (Kulab or Unug-Kulaba) prior to merging with the Eanna District. Kullaba {{dates to the}} Eridu period when {{it was one of}} the oldest and most important cities of Sumer. There are different interpretations about the purposes of the temples. However, it is generally believed they were a unifying feature of the city. It also <b>seems</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> temples served both an important religious function and state function. The surviving temple archive of the Neo-Babylonian period documents the social function of the temple as a redistribution center.|$|E
25|$|Cebus albifrons albifrons {{is found}} in eastern Vichada, close to the type locality, and was defined by von Humboldt using a tame animal {{maintained}} by humans (and a pig) {{in the village of}} Maipures. The original description of von Humboldt described an ashy gray animal with a black tail tip, characteristics that are not typical of any known population of C. albifrons. The C. albifrons located three kilometers to the north of Maipures are very light colored animals with yellowish or reddish tones, very similar to the population of Arauca. Cebus a. unicolor is also very light colored with yellowish tones and it <b>seems</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> it is a synonym of C. a. albifrons.

One sceptic has pointed out that the evidence only emerged once Father Robert Persons had published his A Conference about the Next Succession to the Crown of England. The book does appear to have alarmed Elizabeth's advisers, and from that date onward the flow of supposed plots against the queen's life became steady. In 1601 Cecil himself was accused of treason at the trial of the Earl of Essex {{on the basis of his}} reading of Person's book, but survived this twist and went on to secure the succession of James I upon the queen's death two years later.|$|E

This effort failed, in part because Adams were often unreliable, {{and in part because}} the computer's release coincided with the home computer industry crashing. Coleco withdrew from electronics early in 1985.|$|R
