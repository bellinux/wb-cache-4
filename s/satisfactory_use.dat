Computational {{models of}} {{situation}} awareness {{can be of}} interest for different purposes, varying {{from the study of}} human cognition in demanding circumstances to the development of human-like virtual opponents in serious gaming applications. This paper presents a novel model of situation awareness, which extends previous work at a number of points. In particular, the model incorporates qualitative time references, offers the possibility to use Allen [1]‟s temporal relations, and features an explicit representation of Endsley [4]‟s three phases of situation awareness. The behaviour of the model has been tested within a simulation environment for F- 16 pilots, and the resulting behaviour has been found <b>satisfactory</b> <b>using</b> a formal verification tool...|$|R

Mathematical modelling of the multi-machine system showed the possibility of independent control of each machine in the group.

40|$|Numerous one-electron {{properties}} of the formaldehyde molecule have been calculated using Hartree–Fock–Roothaan wavefunctions obtained from three different basis sets: an unoptimized minimum basis set of Slater orbitals, a (73 / 2) Gaussian basis set, and a (95 / 3) Gaussian basis set. Comparison of the calculated and experimental values is made whenever possible, the agreement in most cases being <b>satisfactory.</b> <b>Use</b> of the more flexible Gaussian wavefunctions results in significant improvements {{in many of the}} properties. Consideration of the atoms shows that no appreciable error arises from the use of Gaussian orbitals as expansion functions for the solution of the Hartree–Fock equations.

Inelastic dynamic analysis was carried out in this research project to develop charts that show variation in ductility requirement with structure height when other structural and ground motion parameters are kept constant. Three structures with different building height, and the same overall geometry were selected for analysis. A total of 20 coupled wall structures were analyzed in this investigation. Each structure was analyzed with different levels of yield strength and two different levels of beam-to-wall strength ratio.
