5|$|Since {{completion}} of the Airport Link in 2012, Metrorail increased its <b>service</b> <b>frequency</b> to peak headways of {{three and a half}} to five minutes on the shared portion of the line from Dadeland South to Earlington Heights.|$|E
5|$|The line {{is due to}} be {{electrified}} {{as part of the}} 21st-century modernisation of the Great Western Main Line, {{which will}} also see the addition of two new running lines to increase capacity. <b>Service</b> <b>frequency</b> will be improved as part of the Greater Bristol Metro scheme.|$|E
5|$|The Bakerloo line's Watford <b>service</b> <b>frequency</b> was {{gradually}} reduced and from 1965 ran only during rush hours. In 1982, the service beyond Stonebridge Park was ended {{as part of}} the fall-out of the cancellation of the Greater London Council's Fares Fair subsidies policy. A peak hours service was restored to Harrow & Wealdstone in 1984 and a full service was restored in 1989.|$|E
50|$|During peak times, <b>service</b> <b>frequencies</b> may be {{increased}} and calling patterns varied. <b>Service</b> <b>frequencies</b> are generally reduced on Sundays.|$|R

5|$|The {{commuter}} train serves suburbs {{further away from}} Oslo, {{though some of the}} commuter rail services remind of a rapid transit service, in particular line L1 and line L2, to Lillestrøm, Asker and Ski, with higher <b>service</b> <b>frequency</b> through the continual populated area of Oslo. Transfer to railway services is available at Jernbanetorget (to Oslo S) and Nationaltheatret, the latter with a considerably shorter walk.|$|E
5|$|The line {{is due to}} be {{electrified}} {{as part of the}} 21st-century modernisation of the Great Western Main Line, {{which will}} also see the addition of two new running lines to increase capacity, although no platforms will be built for these lines. <b>Service</b> <b>frequency</b> will however be improved as part of the Greater Bristol Metro scheme.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} timetable allowed 18 {{minutes for}} the journey. Off-peak <b>service</b> <b>frequency</b> was every 15 minutes, increased to ten minutes during the morning peak and reduced 20 minutes in the early mornings and after 8pm. From May 1864, workmen's returns were offered on the 5:30am and 5:40am services from Paddington {{at the cost of}} a single ticket (3d).|$|E

5|$|Freight trains {{started using}} the tunnel on 26 August 2011, and {{passenger}} trains on 28 August. The official opening {{took place on}} 2 September. Along with several other projects west of Oslo, including a new Lysaker Station and Høvik Station, and an upgrade to the Drammen Line between Lysaker and Etterstad, {{the completion of the}} Asker Line will allow higher <b>service</b> <b>frequency,</b> higher regularity and faster trains west of Oslo. A new high-frequency schedule, named Route Plan 2012, was planned for introduction in early 2013 following delivery of new Stadler FLIRT trains. This will also allow for more trains that stop at all stations on the Drammen Line and introduce three hourly trains to Vestfold and six hourly trains stopping at the main stations west of Oslo.|$|E
25|$|Improvement of the {{infrastructure}} on the Belfast-Londonderry line through, at the very least, the installation of passing loops to allow <b>service</b> <b>frequency</b> to be increased, and upgrading the track to allow higher speeds.|$|E
25|$|Key {{aspects of}} this program include longer {{operating}} hours, higher <b>service</b> <b>frequency,</b> improved information at bus stops including PIDs at major interchanges, wheelchair accessible services, peak hour priority bus lanes and priority at traffic lights.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the opening}} of Britomart Transport Centre, {{significant}} improvements {{have been made to}} commuter rail services. In October 2005, Sunday services were reintroduced {{for the first time in}} over 40 years, together with a general 25% <b>service</b> <b>frequency</b> increase at the time.|$|E
25|$|On June 1, 2014, 24-hour {{operation}} {{began on}} three corridors — the Blok M-Kota route (Corridor 1), Pinang Ranti-Pluit route (Corridor 9) and Kalideres-Pasar Baru route (Corridor 3). Service {{is provided by}} 18 buses with 2 buses in reserve and <b>service</b> <b>frequency</b> is between 30 minutes and an hour.|$|E
25|$|Outbound {{services}} ran non-stop to Christchurch West High School {{to encourage}} those not travelling {{out of the}} central city to use other services {{on account of the}} limited capacity of the Ford V8 buses used on this route. This measure remained in effect until the <b>service</b> <b>frequency</b> had sufficiently increased.|$|E
5000|$|Major Upgrade: {{move the}} San Francisco terminal, {{increase}} <b>service</b> <b>frequencies,</b> and begin investment of public funds.|$|R

25|$|The Board's own {{regular service}} to the airport began on 5 January 1976 {{following}} the Board's acquisition of the license for the route after Midland Motorways discontinued its own airport service. It quickly {{became one of the}} more profitable routes for the Board, justifying an increase in <b>service</b> <b>frequency</b> to 30-minute intervals after only two years.|$|E
25|$|On 28 May 1993 {{all of the}} old {{rolling stock}} was withdrawn, the train service being {{suspended}} temporarily. A temporary bus service was run while the old rolling stock was physically removed and the new rolling stock brought in, and the track and signalling works undertaken, with staff training. The line reopened on 19 July 1993, with a peak <b>service</b> <b>frequency</b> of 3½ minutes.|$|E
25|$|Compared to buses, {{costs can}} be lower due to lower labor costs per {{passenger}} mile, higher ridership (observations show that light rail attracts more ridership than a comparable bus service) and faster average speed (reducing {{the number of}} vehicles needed for the same <b>service</b> <b>frequency).</b> While light rail vehicles are more expensive to buy, they have a longer useful life than buses, sometimes making for lower life-cycle costs.|$|E
50|$|Transport Scotland and Scotrail {{intend to}} improve the <b>service</b> <b>frequencies</b> from here to Elgin & Inverness to hourly from 2018.|$|R
50|$|The use of HF between outback {{travellers}} {{goes back}} many years, based on Royal Flying Doctor <b>Service</b> <b>frequencies</b> such as 5300, 5360 & 5410 kHz.|$|R

25|$|With {{franchising}} of {{passenger train}} services from 1996 under then controversial privatisation of British Rail, Virgin Trains {{has become the}} main operator on the London and Birmingham to Glasgow route, introducing Pendolino train sets. Locomotive haulage of passenger trains has virtually disappeared on the route (although locomotive hauled freightliner trains are increasing). The main line <b>service</b> <b>frequency</b> is considerably better than ever before. First TransPennine Express operate a frequent service between Manchester Airport and Glasgow and Edinburgh.|$|E
25|$|In December 2009 the Circle {{line was}} {{extended}} to include the Hammersmith & City route from Edgware Road to Hammersmith. Rather than continuously running around the circle, trains now travel from Hammersmith to Edgware Road, generally going around the circle once before terminating at Edgware Road, and returning via the same route; occasionally, trains may also continue clockwise through Edgware Road to additional stations. The change was made to improve reliability and increase the <b>service</b> <b>frequency</b> on the Hammersmith branch.|$|E
25|$|A {{project to}} {{transform}} the railway in the city center into underground is underway {{as part of the}} National wide TRA Rapid Transit Systematization in the Metropolitan Areas Project. This project will help increase <b>service</b> <b>frequency</b> by eliminate potential disruption between road and rail traffic. Further to underground transformation, two new stations are planned to serve East district commuters. Together with the Shalun HSR link, this section of TRA corridor will become the backbone of the rail transit system in Tainan.|$|E
50|$|ScotRail has {{mentioned}} {{plans for an}} additional hourly service from Glasgow to Arbroath. This would improve <b>service</b> <b>frequencies</b> for smaller stations on the line, such as Gleneagles.|$|R
25|$|The Abbey {{line is a}} semi-rural line and, due to its {{single-track}} operation, <b>service</b> <b>frequencies</b> are limited. The {{service is}} sometimes referred to locally as the Abbey Flyer.|$|R
50|$|In Canada, Industry Canada's RBR-4, Standards for the Operation of Radio Stations in the Amateur Radio Service, limits {{radio control}} of craft to amateur <b>service</b> <b>frequencies</b> above 30 MHz.|$|R
