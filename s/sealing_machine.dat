40|$|Packaging of {{finished}} products in nylon bags either at rural or urban areas requires sealing process. Sealing process requires heat energy {{which can be}} generated by electricity or burning of biomass materials. Generally, rural electrification in Nigeria suffers backwardness while urban electrification is highly unreliable. This makes Nigeria economy unstable as failure directly affects production sectors. Since biofuel is cheap and are readily available, Hence the need {{to design and fabricate}} a <b>sealing</b> <b>machine</b> that can use biofuel (charcoal) as source of energy for its sealing operation. A charcoal fueled <b>sealing</b> <b>machine</b> was designed, fabricated and tested for nylon package sealing for rural use and places without regular supply of electricity.

40|$|Abstract only availableNeutron Activation Analysis (INAA) was {{discovered}} in 1936, since then this sensitive tool {{has been used to}} determine elemental compositions in a variety of sample matrices in the low parts per billion (ppb) range. Researchers at MURR, the Missouri University Research Reactor Facility, carry out this technique routinely. The process involves exposure of samples (target nuclei) to a source of neutrons. This interaction causes the sample to become irradiated and then release energy in the form of gamma radiation. The intensity and frequency of radiation enable both detection (identification) and quantification of the elements within the sample. A new system for delivering the samples to the reactor core for irradiating is being designed {{in order to make the}} process more efficient and to minimize the exposure of the laboratory technician to the irradiated samples which potentially might damage their health. The system we are developing is called the Pneumatic Tube System Sampler Sealer Prototype. This machine is in charge of mechanically sealing the samples inside a plastic capsule measuring 0. 5 inches in diameter. Next, the capsules are pneumatically sent to the reactor core, where they are irradiated in the neutron flux. The samples travel through a tube that requires a constant flux of pressurized air. In the testing of the <b>sealing</b> <b>machine</b> it was found that a malfunction intermittently occurred due to the machine structure having non-wanted movement and that the heater was not designed to work in its current position. My responsibility was to redesign the sealer machine to reduce the sealing failure rate. Considering the errors that the present machine has, we have proposed a new design that consists of a structure with two parallel tubes; with this we hope to obtain a greater firmness and a reduction of unwanted and/or excessive movements. Secondly we decided to replace the heater with a new one that works in the correct position (down). Finally, we designed a rotating platform that allows us to have better efficiency in the capsule sealing process. The machine is now being manufactured and we soon hope to obtain encouraging results...|$|E

40|$|O presente trabalho foi desenvolvido mediante a condução de três experimentos, os quais geraram informações que serão apresentadas na forma de dois capítulos. No primeiro capítulo, avaliou-se a composição química, o perfil fermentativo e a população microbiana de silagens de estilosantes Campo Grande (SSt), com e sem inoculante microbiano e polpa cítrica peletizada (0, 3, 6, 9 e 12 % na matéria natural), em diferentes períodos de fermentação. O estilosantes foi colhido aos 120 dias após a semeadura, em estágio de florescimento. O inoculante microbiano usado foi o Sil All C 4 (Alltech do Brasil). O {{material}} foi ensilado em sacos plásticos de 25 cm x 35 cm e selados a vácuo com máquina seladora. Foram considerados como efeitos fixos o nível de polpa cítrica (PC), a presença ou não de inoculante (I), o tempo de fermentação (T) e a interação entre os mesmos. Foi utilizado o esquema de medidas repetidas no tempo, sendo os dias de abertura (1; 3; 7; 14; 28 e 56) repetidos dentro de cada unidade experimental. O teor de matéria seca aumentou linearmente com a adição de PC. Observou-se efeito da interação PC x I sobre o teor de proteína bruta, registrando-se maiores valores nas silagens inoculadas. Observou-se efeito das interações PC x I e PC x T sobre o conteúdo de N-NH 3 das silagens. O pH e os teores dos ácidos lático, acético, propiônico e butírico foram afetados pela interação PC x I x T. Foi registrada máxima população de BAL de 9, 59 ufc/g, no primeiro dia de fermentação na silagem não inoculada, cuja população decresceu linearmente ao longo do período de fermentação (P 0, 05), porém este foi influenciado (P< 0, 05) pelo tempo de coleta, cujos os dados ajustaram-se ao modelo cúbico. Verificou-se efeito da interação (P< 0, 05) entre tratamento e tempo de coleta sobre a concentração de amônia ruminal. No experimento 2, foram utilizados 40 animais Nelore, inteiros, com peso inicial de 386 ± 30 kg de peso corporal, distribuídos num delineamento inteiramente casualizados, com cinco tratamentos e oito repetições. O experimento teve duração de 99 dias, sendo 15 dias para adaptação. Os consumos de todos os nutrientes não foram influenciados pelo aumento do nível de SSt nas dietas, exceto o consumo de EE, que decresceu linearmente (P < 0, 05). Não houve efeito de inclusão de SSt sobre o desempenho dos animais, registrando valores médios para ganho médio diário e rendimento de carcaça de 1, 25 kg/dia e 55, 60 %, respectivamente. A silagem de estilosantes Campo Grande pode ser utilizada como fonte única de forragem em dietas para bovinos de corte em fase de terminação, em substituição à silagem de milho, constituindo 50 % da matéria seca da dieta. The present {{work was}} developed by conducting three experiments, which generated information that will be presented {{in the form of}} two chapters. In the first chapter, chemical composition, fermentation and microbial population profile of silages of Stylosanthes Campo Grande (SSt), with and without microbial inoculants and pelletized citrus pulp (0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 % in natural matter) in different fermentation periods, were evaluated. The Stylosanthes was collected at 120 days after sowing, in flowering stage. The microbial inoculants used was the Sil All C 4 (Alltech of Brazil). The material was ensiled in plastic bags of 25 cm x 35 cm, vacuum sealed with <b>sealing</b> <b>machine.</b> Level of pelletized citrus pulp (CPP), presence or absence of inoculant (I), fermentation time (T) and interaction between them were considered as fixed effects. It was applied repeated measures schema at the time, being the days of opening (1; 3; 7; 14; 28 and 56), repeated within each experimental unit. The dry matter content increased linearly with the addition of citrus pulp. Interaction effect CPP x I was observed over the crude protein content, registering higher values in inoculated silage. Effect of the interactions CPP x I and CPP x T was observed over the content of NH 3 -N of silages. The pH and the levels of lactic, acetic, propionic and butyric acids were affected by the interaction CPP x I x T. Maximum population of LAB, 9, 59 cfu/g, was recorded {{on the first day of}} fermentation in not inoculated silage, whose population decreased linearly throughout the fermentation period (P< 0, 05). Maximum population of enterobacteria was observed in the first day after the ensiling, and their presence was not detected after the fourteenth day. On the last day of fermentation was observed effect of CPP (P< 0, 05) over the levels of NDF and ADF of the silage, whereas the lignin content was influenced both by CPP and inoculant. The addition of CPP at a rate of 12 % of natural matter of forage, associated with the use of microbial inoculants, ensures suitable fermentation process in Stylosanthes silages. In the second chapter, it was evaluated the total and partial apparent digestibility of nutrients, pH and rumen ammonia nitrogen concentration (Experiment 1), and production performance (Experiment 2) of beef cattle fed diets containing different proportions of Stylosanthes Campo Grande silage (SSt) :corn silage (CS) 0 : 100, 25 : 75, 50 : 50, 75 : 25 and 100 : 0 based on a forage:concentrate ratio of 50 : 50 on a DM (dry matter) basis. In experiment 1, ten Holstein x Zebu bulls with initial weight of 272 ± 86 kg were used. The bulls were rumen and abomasum fistulated, distributed in two 5 x 5 Latin squares. Chromic oxide was used to estimate the flow of digesta and fecal excretion. The total apparent digestibility of nutrients was not affected by the diets. However, it was observed quadratic effect of level of Stylosanthes silage on ruminal apparent digestibility of DM and linear effect on the ruminal digestibilities of CP, EE and NFC. Nitrogen balance (BN) and plasma urea nitrogen (PUN) were not affected by diets. The ruminal pH was not affected by the increase in the proportion of SSt in the diet (P < 0. 05), however this was influenced (P < 0. 05) by the time of collection, whose data set to the cubic model. It was observed interaction effect (P < 0. 05) between treatment and collection time over concentration of ruminal ammonia. In experiment 2, 40 Nelore breed animals were used, integers, with initial body weight of 386 ± 30 kg, distributed in entirely randomized block design, with five treatments and eight replications. The experiment lasted 99 days, being 15 days for adaptation. The intake of all nutrients were not influenced by the increased level of SSt in the diets, except for the intake of EE, which decreased linearly (P 0. 05). There was no effect of inclusion of SSt on animal performance, registering average values for average daily gain and carcass yield of 1. 25 kg/day and 55. 60 %, respectively. The Stylosanthes Campo Grande silage can be used as single source of forage in diets for beef cattle in termination phase, replacing the corn silage, constituting 50 % of dry matter of the diet...|$|E
