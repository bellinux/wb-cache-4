5|$|In the 1970s, {{parts of}} the covertway and glacis were {{destroyed}} {{to make way for}} large storage tanks. Today, the lines are <b>still</b> <b>more</b> or less intact, but some parts are in a rather dilapidated state and in need of restoration.|$|E
5|$|A <b>still</b> <b>more</b> {{resonant}} {{aspect of}} his legacy was the uniform rewriting of Roman law, the Corpus Juris Civilis, which is still the basis of civil law in many modern states. His reign also marked a blossoming of Byzantine culture, and his building program yielded such masterpieces as the church of Hagia Sophia.

A $62million proposal was presented in 2006, incorporating a museum and an underground carpark. Designed once again by Ashton Raggatt McDougall, the proposal was opposed by local residents and some council members, and ran into significant funding problems when the Federal Government decided not to provide funding.|$|E

5|$|Bromine pentafluoride (BrF5) {{was first}} {{synthesised}} in 1930. It is produced {{on a large}} scale by direct reaction of bromine with excess fluorine at temperatures higher than 150°C, and on a small scale by the fluorination of potassium bromide at 25°C. It is a very vigorous fluorinating agent, although chlorine trifluoride is <b>still</b> <b>more</b> violent. Bromine pentafluoride explodes on reaction with water and fluorinates silicates at 450°C.|$|E

5|$|In 1970 the College of Arts and Sciences {{allowed the}} first women to enroll in its {{undergraduate}} programs, which effectively made the university coeducational.

5|$|The {{team has}} also had several {{instances}} of NCAA sanctions on the program that have affected performance and recruiting. In the 1970s, the Gophers were in a violent brawl with the Ohio State Buckeyes and were barred from post-season appearances for two seasons after an incident involving the illegal resale of tickets. <b>Still</b> <b>more</b> severe was the mid-1990s academic scandal under then-coach Clem Haskins {{that resulted in the}} forfeit of a Final Four appearance.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} a {{mountains}} classification, the leadership of which was marked by a green jersey. In the mountains classifications, points were won by reaching {{the top of a}} climb before other cyclists. Each climb was categorized as either first, second, or third category, with more points available for the higher-categorized climbs. The Cima Coppi, the race's highest point of elevation, awarded <b>still</b> <b>more</b> points than the other first-category climbs.|$|E

5|$|A classic {{result of}} graph theory states that a graph of odd order (having an odd number of vertices) always {{has at least}} one vertex of even degree. (The {{statement}} itself requires zero to be even: the empty graph has an even order, and an isolated vertex has an even degree.) In order to prove the statement, it is actually easier to prove a stronger result: any odd-order graph has an odd number of even degree vertices. The appearance of this odd number is explained by a <b>still</b> <b>more</b> general result, known as the handshaking lemma: any graph has an even number of vertices of odd degree. Finally, the even number of odd vertices is naturally explained by the degree sum formula.|$|E
5|$|A fresh wave of {{concerns}} about France followed in the 1880s, accompanied {{by the introduction of}} <b>still</b> <b>more</b> powerful naval artillery and fast warships and torpedo boats, resulting in a fresh wave of modernisation. An electronically-operated minefield was laid across Carrick Roads in 1885, jointly controlled from St Mawes and Pendennis. New, quick-firing guns were installed at Hurst to enable the castle to engage the newer vessels. Calshot was brought back into service as a coastal fort, with a new battery of quick-firing guns protecting a boom across the estuary. The original 16th-century parts of fortifications such as Southsea and Calshot were too small and unsuitable for modern weapons, however, and were instead used for mounting searchlights, range and direction finding; in some cases their fabric was left to slowly decline.|$|E

The report found that the refugees had struggled to gain employment and English language skills. Another evaluation report undertaken for the Home Office and published in 2011 also found that only small numbers of resettled refugees were in paid employment, noting that many were <b>still</b> <b>more</b> concerned about meeting their basic needs.|$|E

For one week late in November 2016, Windows 10 overtook first rank from Windows 7 in the United States, before losing it again; it becomes more popular every weekend.|$|E
