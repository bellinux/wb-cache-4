The early part of Volume I was enriched from the admirable book on “Greek and Latin Palaeography”, by Edward Maunde Thompson. Many corrections suggested by eminent scholars were introduced in different places throughout the book. H. J. White rewrote the chapter on Latin versions. G. H. Gwilliam, editor of the Peshitta, helped to improve the passages on the Peshitta and the Curetonian Version. H. Deane made an additions {{to the treatment of}} the Harkleian Version. A. C.

5|$|After halting overnight, the {{regiment}} led the NZMRB at 04:30 {{to attack the}} Turkish position. By 05:15 {{the regiment}} made contact with the Turkish outposts and advanced on foot towards the main Turkish defences, under covering fire from the Royal Horse Artillery (RHA). The regiment had the 3rd Squadron on the left, and two troops of the 11th Squadron and a machine-gun <b>section</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right. Their right flank {{was supposed to be}} covered by the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, but it had failed to arrive. In consequence the regiment had to extend its lines to cover the open flank, so two troops from the 4th Squadron were sent there. Things were also not going well on the other flank. At 11:20 the Canterbury Mounted Rifles were forced to retire. Then, just before midday, two Turkish battalions of about 1,100 men attacked the regiment. Still supported by the RHA, the brigade held its positions. For the next three and a half hours, the brigade was subjected to a heavy artillery bombardment. This was followed by another attack by three Turkish battalions. Holding out until 16:15 the regiment was then ordered to pull back. The day's fighting cost the regiment twelve dead and twenty-one wounded.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} few months after the WDWRR opened to the public, Main Street, U.S.A. Station at the Magic Kingdom park's entrance, modeled after the former Victorian-style Saratoga Springs station in Saratoga Springs, New York, was the only stop for {{passengers}} along its route, making only complete round trips possible. On May 1, 1972, the first Frontierland Station opened just northwest of Pecos Bill Tall Tale Inn and Café in the Frontierland <b>section</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> park's western edge. It {{was one of the last}} changes made to the WDWRR prior to the retirement of Roger Broggie on October 1, 1973. Frontierland Station was demolished in November 1990 to make way for the new Splash Mountain attraction and was replaced by the current Frontierland Station, which opened in December 1991 just north of the original station site. During construction of the Splash Mountain attraction and the current Frontierland Station, the WDWRR was temporarily renamed Backtrack Express and operated a single train, which only traveled back and forth along the section of track between the Main Street, U.S.A. section and the Mickey's Starland section. Between 1976 and 1977, the Auto-Train Corporation sponsored the WDWRR.|$|E
5|$|On the Rauma Line, {{the units}} {{are used as}} feeders between the Oslo–Trondheim express trains on the Dovre Line, {{connecting}} Dombås to Åndalsnes. On the Røros Line, the trains are used both on the Hamar–Røros and the Røros–Trondheim <b>section.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> Nordland Line, the Class 93 serves both the Ole Tobias service between Trondheim and Mo i Rana. The unit was considered for use on the Meråker Line as well, but this has continued to be operated by Class 92 units. The initial plan was that eight of the eleven units were needed for daily operations. Four on the Røros Line, two on the Nordland Line and two on the Rauma Line. The additional four units were needed for operating the Trondheim–Bodø trains on the Nordland Line, of which three would be used at any one time. Double units (four cars) are sometimes operated on the Trondheim – Mo i Rana train, as are the Friday and Sunday afternoon trains on the Rauma Line, for exchange of equipment, and to handle the increased traffic on these days. In addition, NSB uses the trains on the commuter services Bodø–Fauske–Rognan and Mo i Rana–Mosjøen.|$|E

5|$|The Magazine of Natural History of 1829 {{expressed}} {{surprise at}} the long interval {{between the first and}} second editions, surmising that there were too few scientific readers in France, apart from those in Paris itself; it notes that while the first volume was little changed, the treatment of fish was considerably altered in volume II, while the <b>section</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Articulata was greatly enlarged (to two volumes, IV and V) and written by M. Latreille. It also expressed the hope that there would be an English equivalent of Cuvier's work, given the popularity of natural history resulting from the works of Thomas Bewick (A History of British Birds 1797–1804) and George Montagu (Ornithological Dictionary, 1802). The same review covers Félix Édouard Guérin-Méneville's Iconographie du Règne Animal de M. le Baron Cuvier, which offered illustrations of all Cuvier's genera (except for the birds).|$|E
