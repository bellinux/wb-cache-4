40|$|The {{alkaline}} texturing {{process of}} Cz-Silicon (Si) wafers {{leads to a}} surface full of randomly distributed pyramids. These pyramids are typically removed on the later rear side of the solar cell by a single side wet chemical polishing process. A variation of the removed amount of Si during this process leads to a certain surface roughness. This work investigates in detail {{the impact of the}} remaining surface roughness on surface recombination of thermal oxide passivated lifetime samples and on the device performance of thermal oxide passivated solar cells. On solar cell level the differences between a solar cell with a fully textured rear side and a solar cell with an almost completely plane rear surface adds up to 2 %abs. The reason is basically an increased surface recombination velocity for rough or textured surfaces. This work presents two up to now unknown mechanisms for the particular increase in SRV with increasing surface roughness of thermal oxide passivated Si surfaces. Shunt or leakage currents through the induced inversion layer as well as recombination in the space charge region near the Si/SiO 2 -interface are increased by a rough surface and increase the total surface recombination. The optical properties of the differently rough surfaces are investigated by different simulation approaches. The optical simulations show relatively small impact of the different surfaces on the generated photo current density (0. 2 mA/cm²). Instead, the actual measured difference in short circuit current density of solar cells with a textured and a plane rear surface is 0. 9 mA/cm². Thus, the impact of the surface roughness on the optical properties of a solar cell is small compared to the impact on the electrical properties of the device. PERC solar cells from different Si material are produced. The used Si materials are boron doped Cz-Si, boron doped magnetically casted Cz-Si and Ga-doped Cz-Si as well as three different cast mono Si materials from three different material suppliers. High conversion efficiencies of up to 19. 9 % on Cz-Si and 19. 8 % on cast mono Si are reached. The amount of dislocations in the cast-mono-Si was identified as critical parameter for the device performance. Especially after light induced degradation the cast-mono-Si solar cells still reach high conversion efficiencies due to the lower oxygen concentration in this material. A parameterization of the SRV at the local contacts in dependence of the acceptor concentration of the base material is given in this work. This is the first time such a parameterization is given for locally laser alloyed contacts (so called laser fired contacts, LFC) on screen printed Al. This parameterization is implemented in an existing analytical model, which now allows for extensive analytical modelling of the produced solar cells. The analytical calculations of the IV-parameters in dependence of the base resistivity are in good correlation with the experimentally measured values of PERC solar cells with base resistivity in the range of 0. 9 to 2. 8 Ohmcm. The analytical simulations allow for the extraction of certain relevant parameters, such as the Shockley-Read-Hall-lifetime of the use bulk material. The SRH-lifetime of one of the cast-mono-Si materials is determined to 90 – 170 µs, which is in good correlation with the actual value, measured on a test sample produced from the same material. The simulations also lead to the conclusion that low base resistivity is essential, especially for materials with low material quality (low SRH-lifetime). Furthermore the analytical model allows for the identification of future ways to improve the conversion efficiency of these devices. For example, it is shown that for high base resistivity it is more urgent to decrease the base saturation current density than the emitter saturation current density whereas for low base resistivity it is the other way around. The boron-oxygen-complex related degradation of PERC solar cells is also simulated. One important result is that for high conversion efficiency after light induced degradation {{it is more important to}} decrease the oxygen concentration in the material than to increase the SRH-lifetime. The last section of this work deals with different requirements on the screen printed soldering pastes used for PERC devices. The bonding of the <b>soldering</b> <b>paste</b> on the passivation and wafer, the damage of the passivation induced by the <b>soldering</b> <b>paste</b> and the contact resistance between Al-paste and <b>soldering</b> <b>paste</b> are investigated in detail. Two suitable soldering pastes were identified and test modules with PERC solar cells are produced. After a temperature cycling test of 102 cycles the loss in module power is less than 5 % and demonstrates the suitability of the produced PERC devices for module interconnection...|$|E

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for: (1) a <b>soldering</b> <b>paste</b> containing coated solder material particles (12) as above; (2) a <b>soldering</b> <b>paste</b> comprising particles of solder material particles enclosed in a binder (13), where the binder contains (a) metal stearate as defined above in an amount of at least 10 (preferably 20) wt. % based on the binder, (b) a solvent or dispersion medium in an amount of at least 50 wt. % and (c) other metal salts, up to 10 wt. % carboxylic acid and/or activators forming {{the remainder of the}} binder; (3) solder material {{in the form of a}} semi-finished product (specifically a wire or shaped article), where the semi-finished product is provided with a layer of solid metal stearate as defined above; (4) a support (17) with contact surfaces for electrical components (or electrical component with contact surfaces), where the contact surfaces are provided with a layer of solid metal stearate as defined above; (5) a support or electrical component with contact surfaces for a soldered connection, on which a solder deposit is formed, where the solder deposit is provided with a metal stearate layer, at least 20 (preferably at least 40) wt. % formed from metal stearate as defined above; (6) the use of a metal stearate (not necessarily as defined above) as flux for solders, where a solid layer of the metal stearate is applied to solder particles, semi-finished solder product, solder deposit on a supporting surface or component or solder connection contact surface on a supporting surface or component; and (7) the use of a metal stearate (not necessarily as defined above) as flux for solders, where the solder material consists of solder particles and a binder to which at least fatty acids and the metal stearate are added, the binder also including a dispersion medium or solvent for the metal stearate. USE - The soldering materials, containing metal stearates as flux, are useful e. g. in the assembly of electronic components. ADVANTAGE - The stearates of metals with relatively low thermodynamic activity towards oxygen provide metal ions with the necessary reducing effect to act as fluxes during soldering. Use of the present specific metal stearates (rather than e. g. copper stearate) reduces the amounts of conventional fluxes required, and provides resin-free soldering materials. Storage and processing of the solder materials is facilitated, and superior soldered connections are obtainable. The fluxes are not subject to significant variations in quality.

Design/methodology/approach – This study concerns the rheological measurements of <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> samples and is made up of three parts. The first part deals with the measurement of rhelogical properties with three different measuring geometries, the second part looks into the effect of frequencies on oscillatory stress sweep measurements and the final part reports on the characterisation and comparison of three different types of Pb-free <b>solder</b> <b>pastes.</b> Findings – Among the three geometries, the serrated parallel plate was found effective in minimising the wall-slip effect. From the oscillatory stresssweep data with different frequencies; it was observed that the linear visco-elastic region is independent of frequency for all the <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> samples. To understand the shear thinning behaviour of <b>solder</b> <b>paste,</b> the well known Cross and Carreau models were fitted to the viscosity data.

40|$|<b>Solder</b> <b>paste</b> {{printing}} is {{the most}} common method for attaching surface mount devices to printed circuit boards and {{it has been reported that}} a majority of all assembly defects occur during the stencil printing process. It is also recognized that the <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> printing process is wholly responsible for the solder joint formation of leadless package technologies such as Land Grid Array (LGA) and Quad-Flat No-Lead (QFN) components and therefore is a determining factor in the long-term reliability of said devices. The goal of this experiment is to determine the acceptable lower limit for <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> volume deposit tolerances during stencil printing process to ensure both good assembly yield and reliability expectations. Stencils with modified aperture dimensions at particular locations for LGA and QFN package footprints were designed in order to vary the <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> volume deposited during the stencil printing process. <b>Solder</b> <b>paste</b> volumes were measured using <b>Solder</b> <b>Paste</b> Inspection (SPI) system. Low volume <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> deposits were generated using the modified stencil designs to evaluate assemble yield. Accelerated Thermal Cycling (ATC) was used to determine the reliability of the solder joints. For the LGAs, solder joints formed with higher paste volume survived longer in ATC compared to lower volume joints. Low <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> volume deposits did not affect BGA devices in ATC. Transfer efficiency numbers for both good assembly yield and good reliability are reported for LGA, QFN and BGA devices.

40|$|The {{two most}} {{important}} trends in electronic industry are "miniaturisation" and "increased functionality". Over the last fifteen years, the electronic manufacturing industries have experienced tremendous pressure {{to meet the requirements}} for miniaturised products, particularly, hand-held consumer products. Functionality of these products has also evolved at the same pace through packing in more and more features. As these trends are set to continue, there is an increasing demand for better understanding of soldering technology, particularly in the area of <b>solder</b> <b>pastes</b> used in the reflow soldering of surface mount devices. Successful assembly of electronic devices for ultra-fine pitch and flip-chip applications requires the deposition of small and consistent paste deposits from pad to pad, and from board to board. The paste printing process at this chip-scale geometry depends on conditions such as good paste roll, complete aperture filling and paste release from the apertures onto the substrate pads. This means that the paste flow and deformation behaviour is very important in defining the printing performance of any <b>solder</b> <b>paste.</b> In order to understand rheological phenomena associated with the flow of <b>solder</b> <b>pastes,</b> it is necessary to understand time dependent rheological behaviour. Such behaviour is common to many industrial fluids and consequently has been of interest to rheologists for many years. The time dependent behaviour observed in <b>solder</b> <b>pastes</b> is largely due to the breakdown of the flocculated structure formed during storage or idle period. In general, the breakdown of the structure with shear results in a decrease in apparent viscosity. Recovery after shear is generally a very slow process and depends on the intensity of the breakdown and previous shear history. The work reported in this thesis on the characterisation and modelling of time-dependent rheological behaviour of <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> and flux mediums used in surface mount applications is made up of four main parts. The first part concerns the characterisation of the time-dependent behaviour of <b>solder</b> <b>pastes</b> and flux mediums. Two types of tests were performed at this stage: hysteresis-loop test and step-shear-rate test. In {{the second part of the}} study the time-dependent rheology of <b>solder</b> <b>pastes</b> and flux mediums has been modelled to evaluate the mechanisms for the break-down of the internal structure of the paste materials. A novel technique has been developed which combines the experimental rheological data with a modified structural kinetic model (SKM) to investigate the rate and extent of structural change of <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> and flux medium. The third part of the study deals with the experimental and modelling studies of the short term build-up of <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> and flux medium structure using the stretched exponential model. In the final part of the study the printing trials of four different <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> samples were carried out to investigate the effect of post-print rest period on slumping behaviour of <b>solder</b> <b>paste.</b> From the experimental characterisation it was evident that both the <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> and flux samples are strongly thixotropic and shear-thinning in nature. The thixotropic breakdown behaviour of <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> and fluxes has been satisfactorily modelled using a second-order structural kinetic model. The results from this study can be of great help for the <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> manufacturers and formulators in quantifying and predicting the effect of long term shearing on the <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> samples. The technique developed can also be utilized for similar materials such as solar pastes and conductive adhesives. The short-term build-up of <b>solder</b> <b>pastes</b> and fluxes has been successfully modelled using the stretched exponential model. The paste manufacturers and formulators can use the technique developed to predict and quantify the slumping behaviour of <b>solder</b> <b>paste.</b> The end-users, for example the electronics assemblers may use the technique to optimize their assembly process by minimising/preventing slumping of <b>solder</b> <b>paste...</b>|$|R

The amount of <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> which is released from the stencil apertures and transferred to the PWB pads, determines whether or not the print is good. Ideally, all volumes of <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> should be equal to the volume of the corresponding stencil aperture. In reality however, this is never the case. Hence, a print is considered to be good if a certain fraction of the paste is released. One way of quantifying print performance is to calculate the Transfer Efficiency. This is mathematically stated as: ...|$|R
40|$|Rheological {{properties}} of <b>solder</b> <b>pastes</b> {{are very important}} for a high quality surface mount technology process. The stencil/screen printing process of <b>solder</b> <b>pastes</b> {{is one of the}} most critical steps in the SMT assembly process, as most of the assembly defects can often be shown to originate from paste rheology and associated poor printing performance. This paper concerns an investigation of the effect of <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> composition on the rheological properties and behaviour of four different <b>solder</b> <b>pastes.</b> We report on the evaluation of three different paste formulations based on the no-clean flux composition, with different alloy composition, metal content and particle size using a range of rheological characterisation techniques - including viscosity measurements, yield stress, oscillatory and creep-recovery tests. Our results show that in the viscosity test, all <b>solder</b> <b>pastes</b> exhibited a shear thinning behaviour in nature with different highest maximum viscosity. In the region of shear thinning behaviour the paste 3 delivered the best results. Viscosity test helps to understand the solid and cohesive behaviour of <b>solder</b> <b>pastes.</b> Good solid and cohesive behaviour indicates a good paste roll and helps to avoid paste bleeding. The yield stress test has been used to study the effect of temperature on the flow behaviour of <b>solder</b> <b>pastes.</b> Yield stress was measured for a range of temperature from 15 deg C to 35 deg C with an increment of 5 degC. The result indicated a decreasing of the yield stress point if the temperature was increased. Paste 4 has shown the minimum dependence on temperature. The oscillatory test has been used to find out the linear visco-elastic range and to study the solid and liquid like behaviours of <b>solder</b> <b>pastes.</b> Paste 1 indicated the biggest linear visco-elastic region (LVR) and the highest value of G' and G" which means <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> 1 will be needed a higher squeegee pressure in the printing process. In the creep recovery test paste 4 showed the best- - recovery and the lowest values of creep and recovery compliance which indicated a good printing behaviour. The test also has showed the <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> with smaller particle size exhibit less recover...|$|R
40|$|<b>Solder</b> <b>paste</b> is {{the primary}} bonding {{material}} used in the assembly of surface mount devices in electronics industries. It generally has a flocculated structure, which may break-down on shearing and slowly rebuild at rest. The proper characterization of the time-dependent rheological behaviors of <b>solder</b> <b>pastes</b> is crucial for establishing {{the relationships between the}} pastes’ structure and flow behavior and for correlating the physical parameters with paste printing performance. In this paper, we present a novel method that has been developed for characterizing the time-dependent and non-Newtonian rheological behavior of <b>solder</b> <b>pastes</b> and flux mediums as a function of shear rates. The objective of the study reported in this paper was to investigate the thixotropic build-up behavior of <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> and flux mediums. The stretched exponential model has been used to model the structural changes during the build-up process and to correlate model parameters with the paste printing process. As expected, for <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> samples, the rate of structural recovery was found dependent on the applied shear rate. The model parameters, such as equilibrium viscosity and characteristic time, have been correlated with the shear-thinning and slumping behaviors of <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> during the stencil printing process...|$|R
40|$|In {{surface mount}} {{technology}} (SMT) electronics assembly, the <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> is printed onto the PCB's surface through a stencil and the components are later placed over the <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> deposits. Since 2007, the use of extremely small SMT components for assembly of SMT devices has been widespread, and achieving consistent print deposits for fine pitch (the distance between the leads of the components) components has become a real challenge. The majority of the defects at the printing stage, such as skipping and bridging, {{were found to be}} related to the quality of the <b>solder</b> <b>paste.</b> These defects are usually carried over to the reflow process, causing defective final products. Hence, it is important to monitor the quality of the <b>solder</b> <b>paste.</b> Conventional techniques for monitoring the quality of <b>solder</b> <b>pastes</b> during the production and packaging stage are usually based on the viscosity measurements of the <b>solder</b> <b>pastes</b> from the viscometer and rheometer. One of the potential limitations of viscometer- and rheometer-based measurements is that the collection and preparation of the <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> samples can irreversibly alter the structure and flow behaviour of the sample. Due to the sample preparation process (removal, preshear/ pre-mixing), repeatability issues were often encountered when taking measurements using a viscometer or rheometer. Secondly, rheological measurements and the interpretation of rheological data comprise a very technical and time consuming process, which requires professionally trained research and development (R&D) personnel. Finally, the monitoring/inspection process usually employs random sampling technique from the production batch. Hence, measurement may not represent the actual quality of the whole production batch. This would mean that the conventional <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> quality control that has been employed in the industry as a benchmark for printability (i. e. checking the viscosity of the paste before being despatched to the customers), would need to be re-evaluated for its feasibility and other possible methods of <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> quality control would need to be considered. This has brought the ultrasound technique into context as it can offer a non-destructive evaluation of the quality of the <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> in terms of viscosity. Also, it can be used at different stages of paste production and processing. It is for these reasons that materials suppliers that formulate and produce <b>solder</b> <b>pastes,</b> as well as <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> consumers (especially contract electronics manufacturers), are keen to see the development of simple, easy-to-use and accurate techniques for the rheological characterisation of <b>solder</b> <b>pastes.</b> This thesis concerns the study of a non-destructive ultrasonic technique for characterising the rheological properties of <b>solder</b> <b>pastes</b> and, specifically, the use of through-mode microsecond ultrasonic pulses for evaluation of viscoelastic properties of <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> materials. In this study, a wide range of flux systems and solder alloy particle distributions used in the industry are investigated to determine the correlation of the ultrasound attenuation and velocity to the viscosity of the <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> and their correlation to paste printing performance. The work is part of a bigger study aimed at the development of an on-line quality control technique for paste manufacture based on both conventional rheological tests and ultrasound measurements. Results from the work on the comparative study of standard fluids and both commercial and newly formulated <b>solder</b> <b>pastes</b> and flux vehicle systems have been used to demonstrate the utilisation of the ultrasound technique for on-line, non-destructive measurement of the viscosity of non- Newtonian materials such as <b>solder</b> <b>pastes.</b> The study also found that the viscosity of the <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> is governed by the intermolecular forces between the solder particles and the flux. The strength of these intermolecular forces depends on the probability of these particles rubbing up against one another while the paste is being sheared. Provided that the right correction factor for a particular shear rate is used, the ultrasound viscosity results obtained were found to be comparable to the rheometer viscosity results or to the viscosity provided by the <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> manufacturer. The ultrasound technique produced consistent results and was also proven to work at low temperatures. The ultrasound technique may be used to help <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> manufacturers to add the correct amount of flux or solder particles to their paste in order to reach a desired viscosity. Otherwise, it can be used as a quick go/no-go monitoring tool in the production line for predicting printing quality. Based on the foregoing, it can be concluded that the ultrasound technique is a viable alternative to using a rheometer...|$|R

The study investigates rheological behaviour and stencil printing performance of the lead-free <b>solder</b> <b>pastes</b> (Sn/Ag/Cu). Oscillatory stress sweep test was carried out to study the visco-elastic behaviour of the lead-free <b>solder</b> <b>pastes.</b> The visco-elastic behaviour of the paste encompasses solid and liquid characteristic of the paste, {{which could be used}} to study the flow behaviour experienced by the pastes during the stencil {{printing process}}.

In addition, the results from the study showed that the <b>solder</b> <b>paste</b> with a large G 0 = G 0 0 has a higher cohesiveness resulting in poor withdrawal of the paste during the stencil printing process.
