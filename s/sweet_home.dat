5|$|However, {{the game}} often {{considered}} the first true survival horror, due {{to having the}} most influence on Resident Evil, was the 1989 release <b>Sweet</b> <b>Home,</b> for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was created by Tokuro Fujiwara, who would later go on to create Resident Evil. Sweet Homes gameplay focused on solving a variety of puzzles using items stored in a limited inventory, while battling or escaping from horrifying creatures, {{which could lead to}} permanent death for any of the characters, thus creating tension and an emphasis on survival. It was also the first attempt at creating a scary and frightening storyline within a game, mainly told through scattered diary entries left behind fifty years before the events of the game. Developed by Capcom, the game would become the main inspiration behind their later release Resident Evil. Its horrific imagery prevented its release in the Western world, though its influence was felt through Resident Evil, which was originally intended to be a remake of the game. Some consider <b>Sweet</b> <b>Home</b> to be the first true survival horror game.|$|E

25|$|In 1970 she reprised {{her part}} as Christine from Stolen Kisses in Truffaut's Bed and Board as a married woman.

She starred in Hearth Fires (Les feux de la chandeleur, 1972) as Laura, a daughter who wants to reconcile her parents (Annie Girardot, Jean Rochefort) and {{who falls in love}} with her mother's best friend (Bernard Fresson).

25|$|NY356 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. It began at NY384 (now NY266) in the city of Tonawanda and ended at NY270 in the hamlet of Getzville. On April1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of NY356 between the Tonawanda city line and US62 was transferred from the state of New York to Erie County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. As a result, NY356 was truncated eastward to begin at US62. The NY356 designation was removed entirely on January7, 1988. The former routing of NY356 is now maintained by Erie County as County Route580 (CR580) from the Tonawanda city line to US62, CR232 between US62 and <b>Sweet</b> <b>Home</b> Road, and CR294 (North Forest Road) and CR45 (Dodge Road) east of Ellicott Creek.

25|$|When {{designing}} the museum, the Smithsonian utilized its experience with Mitsitam Caf√© at the National Museum of the American Indian. That cafeteria {{had been established}} to familiarize museum-goers with the rich food heritage of indigenous peoples of the Americas. Mitsitam Caf√© not only proved popular and won culinary awards, but made {{a substantial amount of}} profit. The idea of regional food stations came from Dr. Jessica B. Harris, a food scholar who researched the food of African Americans from the colonial era to the present and presented her research to the museum's scholarly committee in 2013. Albert Lukas, a supervising chef at <b>Sweet</b> <b>Home</b> Caf√©, traveled the United States for two years to find recipes and interview home cooks and professional chefs. A committee of chefs, curators, and historians spent another two years working out the restaurant's concept, visual design, and menu (the latter of which was designed by executive chef Grant). The final menu was designed not only to showcase the kinds of food African Americans of different regions ate at different times in American history, but also to demonstrate the impact African Americans had on both home cooking and haute cuisine.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Sutherland's voice started to decline and her vibrato {{loosened}} to an intrusive extent. However, {{thanks to her}} vocal agility and solid technique, she continued singing the most difficult roles amazingly well. As her vocal security to some extent lessened, paradoxically her dramatic grasp of the theatrical moment heightened. During the 1980s, she added Anna Bolena, Amalia in I masnadieri, and Adriana Lecouvreur to her repertoire, and repeated Esclarmonde at the Royal Opera House performances in November and December 1983. Her last full-length dramatic performance was as Marguerite de Valois (Les Huguenots) at the Sydney Opera House in 1990, {{at the age of}} 63, where she sang Home <b>Sweet</b> <b>Home</b> for her encore. Her last public appearance, however, took place in a gala performance of Die Fledermaus on New Year's Eve, 1990, at Covent Garden, where she was accompanied by her colleagues Luciano Pavarotti and the mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne. According to her own words, given in an interview with The Guardian newspaper in 2002, her biggest achievement was to sing the title role in Esclarmonde. She considered those performances and recordings her best.|$|E
