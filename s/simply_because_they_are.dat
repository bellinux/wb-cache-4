5|$|There {{are a few}} {{inconsistencies}} {{from the}} naturalist's view point. Foxes and badgers are not necessarily mutual enemies in nature. Badgers do not normally invade the homes of foxes, and are not typically dirty. Badgers do sometimes eat bunnies, not from a predilection for bunnies but <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> omnivorous. The inconsistencies are few and employed to create individual characters rather than evoke an archetypical fox and badger.|$|E
25|$|The {{tests have}} narrowed the {{curriculum}} {{to a lot}} of schools, usually squeezing out classes such as art and music <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> excluded in the tests, then they are wiped out of the curriculum. Teachers are then forced to teach subjects that only influence the literacy level and comprehension ability of a student and leave out the ones that often require talent or skill.|$|E
25|$|Although the SPGB {{claim to}} follow Marx's precepts, {{they claim to}} follow them <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> correct in their own right, not because Marx was a special individual, {{sometimes}} quoting his own contention that Je ne suis pas marxiste (I am not a Marxist). They do, however, often challenge {{the use of the}} term Marxist in the media, specifically when used to describe guerrilla and terrorist movements that have nothing to do with what the SPGB considers to be working-class socialist emancipation.|$|E

50|$|After the Second World War, {{there was}} {{widespread}} feeling amongst progressives that the pillarized political {{system should be}} broken open. No longer should Roman Catholic people vote for the Catholic RKSP <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> Catholic or Reformed people for the Anti Revolutionary Party <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> Reformed. Instead, political issues should structure the political system. The progressives were united in their vision of a democratic socialist Netherlands.|$|R

25|$|However, {{only certain}} types of {{structures}} are vulnerable to this resonance effect. Taller buildings have their own frequencies of vibration. Those that are six to fifteen stories tall also vibrate at the 2.5-second cycle, making them act like tuning forks {{in the event of}} an earthquake. The low-frequency waves of an earthquake are amplified by the mud of the lakebed, which in turn, is amplified by the building itself. This causes these buildings to shake more violently than the earthquake proper as the earthquake progresses. Many of the older colonial buildings have survived hundreds of years on the lakebed <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not tall enough to be affected by the resonance effect.|$|E
25|$|The {{causes of}} {{corporate}} failure, {{at least in}} the market segment of the economy, all begin of the creation of credit and debt. Occasionally excessive debts are run up through outright embezzlement of the company's assets or fraud by the people who run the business. Negligent mismanagement, which is found to breach the duty of care, is also sometimes found. More frequently, companies go insolvent because of late payments. Another business on which the company relied for credit or supplies could also be in financial distress, and a string of failures could be part of a broader macroeconomic depression. Periodically, insolvencies occur because technology changes which outdates lines of business. Most frequently, however, businesses are forced into insolvency <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> out-competed. In an economy organised around market competition, and where competition presupposes losers or contemplates excess, insolvencies necessarily happen. The variety of causes for corporate failure means that the law requires different responses to the particular issues, and this is reflected in the legal meaning of insolvency.|$|E

"The Government of the United States is not {{entitled}} to affirm as a universal proposition, with reference {{to a number of}} independent States for whose conduct it assumes no responsibility, that its interests are necessarily concerned in whatever may befall those States, <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> situated in the Western Hemisphere." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{only way}} to do that was to begin with them in the very {{simplest}} way; to meet them on common human ground; to make them feel that, <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> men and women, he felt for them; that, <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> men and women, he loved them; that, <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> men and women, he could not turn his back upon them, {{for the sake of his}} Father and their Father in heaven. If he had left those poor wretches to themselves; if he had even merely kept apart from their common every-day life, and preached to them, they would never have felt that there was still hope for them, <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> men and women. They would have said in their hearts, 'See; he will talk to us: but he looks down on us all the time. We are fallen so low, we cannot rise; we cannot mend. What is there in us that can mend? We are nothing but brutes, perhaps; then brutes we must remain. Heaven is for people like him, perhaps; but not for such as us. We are cut off from men. We have no brothers upon earth, no Father in heaven.' 'Let us eat and drink, for to- morrow we die.' ...|$|R
50|$|Though {{everything}} Haymes {{says here}} is not correct (Baker Book House published at least four of Bales' books), Haymes here and in later remarks seems to touch on the salient aspects for which Bales is most remembered. His personal likability and sincerity were almost universally admired, even by his bitterest enemies. His intellectual honesty is demonstrated in that did not always espouse conservative issues <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> conservative issues. He did not hold to positions <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> popular. As the result of events and changing times, his views sometimes became objects of controversy and strong disagreement, from both within and without the Churches of Christ.|$|R

500|$|Though Cochrane {{argues that}} nonhuman animals {{are not the}} victim of an {{injustice}} <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> owned, he claims that ownership of an animal must be understood as not entailing absolute control over said animal. He conceptualises owned animals as [...] "individual sentient creatures with interests of their own". In understanding owned animals in this way, he challenges alternative accounts that frame owned animals variously as living artifacts, slaves, co-citizens or beings who have strategically situated themselves alongside humans. In Animal Rights Without Liberation, Cochrane argues {{that there is nothing}} intrinsically wrong with using or owning animals, and so, as long as their interests are respected, there is nothing intrinsically wrong with using them, for example, in scientific tests, or for agricultural purposes. Ahlhaus and Niesen characterise the book as a whole as a critique of Singer's Animal Liberation, saying that the former explores the latter's [...] "undeclared premise that liberation is what animals want or need".|$|E
500|$|Although {{nothing is}} known of a [...] "cricket season" [...] per se in 1598, cricket was being played in the {{south-east}} of England {{at the time and}} so 1598 was the first season, as such, since the sport's earliest known reference. The sparse information available about the early years suggests that {{it may have been a}} children's game in the 16th century but, by 1611, it had become an adult pastime. The earliest known organised match was played c.1611, a year in which other significant references to the sport are dated. From 1611 to 1725, less than thirty matches are known to have been organised between recognised teams. Similarly, only a limited number of players, teams and venues of the period have been recorded. The earliest matches played by English parish teams are examples of village cricket. Although village matches are now considered minor in status, the early matches are significant in cricket's history <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> known. There were no newspaper reports of matches until the end of the seventeenth century and so the primary sources are court records and private diaries, hence games were rarely recorded.|$|E
500|$|Some Christians {{integrate}} {{yoga and}} other aspects of Eastern spirituality with prayer and meditation. This has been attributed to a desire to experience God in a more complete way. In 2013, Monsignor Raffaello Martinelli, servicing Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, having worked for over 23 years with Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (Pope Benedict XVI), said that for his Meditation, a Christian can learn from other religious traditions (zen, yoga, controlled respiration, Mantra), quoting Aspects of Christian meditation: [...] "Just as [...] "the Catholic Church rejects nothing of what is true and holy in these religions," [...] neither should these ways be rejected out of hand <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not Christian. On the contrary, one can take from them what is useful so long as the Christian conception of prayer, its logic and requirements are never obscured. It is within the context of all of this that these bits and pieces should be taken up and expressed anew." [...] Previously, the Roman Catholic Church, and some other Christian organizations have expressed concerns and disapproval with respect to some eastern and New Age practices that include yoga and meditation.|$|E
50|$|Existing {{prominent}} {{trees were}} very {{often used as}} markers, survey points indicating boundaries of both private and government land tenure.

50|$|While the {{companys}} {{wide range}} of production was impressive, quantity usually {{did not meet the}} needs of industrial customers.

2500|$|A large {{proportion}} of people suffering from MDR-TB are unable to access treatment due to what Paul Farmer describes as an [...] "Outcome Gap". The majority of people struck with MDR-TB live in [...] "resource-poor settings" [...] and are denied treatment because international organizations have refused to make technologies available to countries who cannot {{afford to pay for}} treatment, the reason being that second line drugs are to expensive therefore treatment methods for MDR-TB are not sustainable in impoverished nations. Paul Farmer argues that this is social injustice and we cannot allow people to die <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> faced with circumstances where they cannot afford [...] "effective therapy".|$|E

50|$|These steps hardly had {{an effect}} on {{prisoner}} productivity. In December 1944, at conferences in Katowice, it was brought to attention that the real cause of prisoners' low productivity: the motivational system was characterized as ineffective and the capos as “good,” but it was admitted that the prisoners worked slowly <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> hungry.|$|R
2500|$|The National Academy of Sciences {{recommends}} that major educational decisions not be {{based solely on}} a single test score. The use of minimum cut-scores for entrance or graduation does not imply a single standard, since test scores are nearly always combined with other minimal criteria such as number of credits, prerequisite courses, attendance, etc. [...] Test scores are often perceived as the [...] "sole criteria" [...] <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> the most difficult, or the fulfillment of other criteria is automatically assumed. [...] One exception to this rule is the GED, which has allowed many people to have their skills recognized {{even though they did}} not meet traditional criteria.|$|E
2500|$|Don Kulick {{argues that}} {{the search for a}} link between sexual {{identity}} categories and language is misplaced, since studies have failed to show that the language gay men and lesbians use is unique. Kulick argues that though some researchers may be politically motivated to imagine a LGBTQ community that is a unified whole and identifiable through linguistic means, this speech community does not necessarily exist as such. Kulick points out that the LGBTQ community is not homogeneous, nor is its language use. Features of “gay speech” are not used consistently by gay individuals, nor are they consistently absent from the speech of all heterosexual individuals. [...] Further, Kulick takes issue with frequently circular definitions of queer speech. He argues that speech patterns cannot be labeled LGBTQ language <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> used by LGBTQ people.|$|E
2500|$|The plaintiffs had principally {{claimed that}} they had {{standing}} {{by virtue of their}} status as Ohio taxpayers, alleging that the investment tax credit injured them by [...] "deplet the funds of the State of Ohio to which the Plaintiffs contribute through their tax payments" [...] and thus [...] "diminish the total funds available for lawful uses and impos disproportionate burdens on" [...] them. [...] The Court had in several prior cases denied federal taxpayers standing under Article III to object to a particular expenditure of federal funds <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> taxpayers. [...] The Court believed that the rationales for rejecting federal taxpayer standing applied with equal force to state taxpayers, as a prior case had indicated. [...] The municipal taxpayer standing established by Mellon was not available in claims that did not involve municipal action, where the plaintiffs challenged a state law and state tax credit.|$|E
