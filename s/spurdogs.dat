50|$|Small {{numbers of}} bighead <b>spurdogs</b> are caught {{incidentally}} by longliners fishing for ruby snapper (Etelis carbunculus) south of New Caledonia. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks sufficient data {{to assess the}} conservation status of this species.|$|E
50|$|Squalus is a genus of {{dogfish sharks}} {{in the family}} Squalidae. Commonly known as <b>spurdogs,</b> these sharks are {{characterized}} by smooth dorsal fin spines, teeth in upper and lower jaws similar in size, caudal peduncle with lateral keels; upper precaudal pit usually present, and caudal fin without subterminal notch. In <b>spurdogs,</b> the hyomandibula (the bone connecting the braincase to the jaws) is oriented at a right angle to the neurocranium, while in other sharks, the hyomandibula runs more parallel to the body. This led some {{to think that the}} upper jaw of Squalus would not be as protractile as the jaws of other sharks. However, a study that compared different jaw suspension types in sharks showed {{that this is not the}} case and that Squalus is quite capable of protruding its upper jaw during feeding.|$|E
40|$|The Norwegian fishery of spurdog (Squalus acanthias L.), {{which started}} in 1930, has played a {{dominant}} part in the fishery for this species in Europe. During 1963 - 1968 a change occured in the behaviour of the spurdog stock. The <b>spurdogs</b> left the traditional fishing grounds, and this lead to a depression in the Norwegian fishery. New concentrations were discovered in the southern North Sea during the autumn 1968. Several tagging experiments, 1975 - 1979, indicate that the <b>spurdogs</b> in this area migrate to the area north of Scotland during the spring. Recaptures from taggings 1959 - 1966 together with information on Scottish spurdog catches during 1947 - 1957, indicate that the <b>spurdogs</b> in the southern North Sea belong to the Scottish-Norwegian spurdog stock. During {{the last two years}} the Norwegian longline fishery for <b>spurdogs</b> has been greatly reduced. Length distributions indicate that maturing and mature females which constitute {{the main part of the}} Norwegian catch, were heavily reduced in numbers from 1975 - 1979. Research should be intensified to establish a basis for international regulation of the spurdog fishery...|$|E
40|$|Large {{numbers of}} <b>spurdog</b> were caught {{during the first}} {{sampling}} trip, with 217 tagged with Petersen discs and released. The second sampling trip yielded few <b>spurdog,</b> although catches {{at that time of}} year are known to be small. <b>Spurdog</b> were not observed on the first three days of the third trip, but reasonable numbers were captured on the last day, just off the Mull of Galloway. The fourth trip (late October to early December) yielded some reasonably large catches of <b>spurdog</b> from the grounds just off Anglesey. The <b>spurdog</b> caught were generally in good condition, although the bait stripper can damage the jaws, and those fish tagged and released were considered to be in a good state of health. The length range of <b>spurdog</b> caught was 49 – 116 cm, with catches in Q 1 and Q 3 being mainly large (> 90 cm) females. Catches in Q 4 yielded a greater proportion of smaller fish. The sex ratio of fish caught was heavily skewed towards females, with more than 99 % of the <b>spurdog</b> caught in Q 1 female. Although more males were found in Q 3 and Q 4, females were still dominant, accounting for 87 % and 79 % of the <b>spurdog</b> catch, respectively. Numerically, between 16. 5 and 41. 9 % of <b>spurdog</b> captured were> 100 cm, the current Maximum Landing Length...|$|R
40|$|Two {{species of}} <b>spurdog</b> {{of the genus}} Squalus occur in the Gulf of Gabès (southern Tunisia, central Mediterranean) : the longnose <b>spurdog</b> Squalus blainvillei (Risso, 1827) and a short-snout <b>spurdog</b> of the Squalus megalops-cubensis group. Morphometric and meristic data {{as well as a}} genetic {{analyses}} (DNA inter-simple sequence repeat markers and molecular barcoding methods) support the assignation of this short-snout <b>spurdog</b> to Squalus megalops (Macleay, 1881). Squalus megalops occurs commonly in temperate and tropical Australian waters, and is also thought to occur in the eastern Atlantic, southern Indian Ocean and western North Pacific although these records need to be confirmed. Our study confirms that it occurs in the Mediterranean Sea. Populations of both S. blainvillei and S. megalops are described based on Tunisian material...|$|R
50|$|The Philippines <b>spurdog</b> (Squalus montalbani), {{also known}} as the Indonesian greeneye <b>spurdog</b> is a {{relatively}} large species of dogfish shark native to waters off the coast of Australia, the Philippines, and Indonesia. The species was identified in 1912 from a specimen caught off the coast of Luzon Island, and has been both bycatch and a targeted species in fisheries since. Its taxonomy is complex, having been renamed in 1931, being misidentified as a type of shortspine <b>spurdog,</b> then being revived as a species in 2007.|$|R
40|$|Spurdog {{landings}} {{are made}} on {{all parts of the}} Irish coastline but most heavily concentrated on the west of the country. The fishery expanded to a maximum catch of just under 8, 000 tonnes in 1985. The species had been pursued most intensively in the north west but effort is shifting southwards. This account of the south west Ireland fishery is based on material collected between April 1987 and March 1988, inclusive; information was collected by questionnaire and 5, 300 individual fish were examined. Ageing was undertaken using the posterior spine: ages in the commercial catches ranged between 5 and 40 + years. The growth characteristics of the south-west Ireland <b>spurdogs</b> resemble those of the Scottish-Norwegian fish, but the Irish populations have a lower L∞. Female maturation takes place at a shorter length than in other populations hitherto investigated from British or Irish waters; the length at 50 % maturity is slightly more than 74 cm which corresponds with an age of 14 years. The fecundity of the south west Ireland <b>spurdogs</b> is relatively high. Mortality coefficients (Z) of fully recruited <b>spurdogs</b> are calculated from age 17 as 0. 24 for females and 0. 30 for males. Two life tables are constructed. The first, which is intended to ascertain the numbers of female whelps required to maintain numbers, suggests that the stocks are close to being overfished. The second life table examines the age structure of the breeding female component of the population but its outcome is inconclusive. In terms of its organization the south west of Ireland spurdog fishery can be considered as two separate fisheries: a trawl and a gill net fishery, the latter being regarded as the more detrimental to the prospect of sustained yield...|$|E
40|$|In age {{and growth}} studies, many species seem {{to follow a}} {{different}} growth trajectory than the traditionally applied von Bertalanffy growth model (VBGM). To test a methodology for improving growth modeling in poorly studied chondrichthyans, 568 longnose <b>spurdogs</b> of Mediterranean origin were aged. A set of seven growth models were fitted to the obtained age-length data. Comparisons in growth model accuracy based on the Akaike Information Criterion allowed {{the assessment of the}} best model. In the case that no model fitted the data correctly, a multi-model inference (MMI) was carried out based on model averaging. The results provided evidence that the growth parameters inferred with the VBGM should be used with caution. JRC. G. 3 -Maritime affair...|$|E

40|$|Identification and {{incorporation}} of residential behaviour into elasmobranch management plans {{has the potential}} to substantially increase their effectiveness by identifying sites where Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) might be used to help conserve species with high migratory potential. There is evidence that <b>spurdog</b> (Squalus acanthias) displays site association in some parts of its global distribution, but this has currently not been shown within the North East Atlantic where it is critically endangered. Here we investigate the movements of electronically tagged <b>spurdog</b> within Loch Etive, a sea loch on the west coast of Scotland. Archival data storage tags (DSTs), that recorded depth and temperature, revealed that mature female <b>spurdog</b> over wintered within the loch, restricting their movements to the upper basin, and remaining either in the loch or the local vicinity {{for the rest of the}} year. This finding was supported by evidence for limited movements from conventional mark/recapture data and acoustically tagged individual <b>spurdog.</b> Some of the movements between the loch basins appear to be associated with breeding and parturition events. This high level of site association suggests that spatial protection of the loch would aid the conservation of different age and sex classes of <b>spurdog...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{possibilities}} of the direct determination of the thiobarbituric acid (TBA) value in trichloracetic acid (TCA) extracts instead of distillates were evaluated. Tests carried out on herring (Clupea harengus L.), redfish (Sebastes marinus L.), cod (Gadus morhua L.), plaice (Pleuronectes platessa L.) and <b>spurdog</b> (Squalus acanthias L.) of varying degree of oxidation gave 95. 3 % recovery in the teleost species but only 75. 2 % in the elasmobranch <b>spurdog,</b> due to the urea present.
