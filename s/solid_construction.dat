Although the structure is generally weather-tight, due to both <b>solid</b> <b>construction</b> and a copper roof, the reinforced concrete tower is plagued by the elements.

40|$|The {{function}} of minimization of <b>construction</b> <b>solid</b> waste {{is to reduce}} or eliminates the adverse impacts {{on the environment and}} to human health. Due to the increase of population that leads to rapid development, there are possibilities of <b>construction</b> <b>solid</b> waste to be increased shortly from the construction works, demolition or renovation works. Materials such as wood, concrete, paint, brick, roofing, tiles, plastic and any other materials would contribute problem involving <b>construction</b> <b>solid</b> waste. Therefore, the proper waste minimization is needed to control the quantity of <b>construction</b> <b>solid</b> waste produced. This paper identifies the type of <b>construction</b> <b>solid</b> waste produced and discusses the waste minimization practice by the contractors at construction sites in Selangor, Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya, Malaysia...|$|R

40|$|Generally, <b>construction</b> <b>solid</b> {{waste is}} {{produced}} from new construction, demolition or renovation work. The {{common type of}} the <b>construction</b> <b>solid</b> waste produced are wood, concrete, paint, brick, roofing tiles, tiles, plastic and many more. Proper management and better planning are needed to control, reduce or minimize the quantity of <b>construction</b> <b>solid</b> waste during <b>construction.</b> This research is conducted to investigate the status of <b>construction</b> <b>solid</b> waste management at construction sites. In order to achieve this aim, several objectives have been determined for this research. The first objective is to identify types of the <b>construction</b> <b>solid</b> waste produce at construction sites. The second objective is to investigate the management practices of the <b>construction</b> <b>solid</b> waste at <b>construction</b> site. The final objective {{is to determine the}} amount of <b>construction</b> <b>solid</b> waste produced in the different types of construction sites. However, this paper presents an overview of the <b>construction</b> <b>solid</b> waste management practice at construction sites as this research is in the preliminary phase. The methodology that will be used for this research is mixed methods. This method is combination of quantitative and qualitative data collections. For the quantitative method, questionnaire will be distributed to contractors in order to achieve the first and second objectives. For qualitative methods, observations at site will be conducted at commercial, residential, infrastructure and mixed development construction sites to attain the third objective. This research will be conducted at the central region of peninsular Malaysia such as Selangor, Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya. These locations are chosen due to its immense construction and development areas. This research hopes to contribute knowledge on construction waste management practices in our country...|$|R

25|$|The basements of bergfrieds {{were often}} {{embedded}} several metres into the ground. Undermining was therefore {{not a great}} threat. Arson was also very difficult due to their stone construction and the few light openings could be quickly closed to prevent being smoked out. The conservative historian therefore sees the bergfried {{as a means of}} passive defence, as a refuge for a few days until relief arrived. For this reason, very few facilities for active defence can be found in these buildings. The main aim was to prevent an attacker breaking in. To storm such a tower within a few days is almost impossible. Thanks to their <b>solid</b> <b>construction</b> many bergfrieds even escaped later demolition attempts by the surrounding rural population, who wanted to carry off building materials from abandoned castles and reuse them.|$|E
25|$|The Colt Python {{was first}} {{introduced}} in 1955 as Colt's top-of-the-line model and was originally {{intended to be a}} large-frame 38 Special target revolver. As a result, it features precision adjustable sights, a smooth trigger, <b>solid</b> <b>construction,</b> and extra metal. Pythons have a distinct appearance due to a full barrel underlug, ventilated rib and adjustable sights. Colt originally manufactured Pythons with hollow underlugs but left them solid to work as a stabilizing barrel weight. When the revolver is at full cock, just as the trigger is pressed, the cylinder locks up {{for the duration of the}} hammer strike. Other revolvers have a hint of looseness even at full-cock. The gap between the cylinder and forcing cone is very tight, further aiding accuracy and velocity. From the 1970s each Python revolver was boresighted at the factory with a laser; the first mass-produced revolver for which this was done.|$|E
25|$|The rooms {{within the}} {{elongation}} are accessed through a 48-foot long, 6-foot wide gallery. The gallery is enclosed in its full length {{through the use}} of an original row of wooden balustrade, supporting operable wooden transoms, movable wooden louvers and wooden shutters, simultaneously providing shade and air, two important local design considerations, as Ponce is known for its hot weather and its implacable sun. Another significant design in Casa Vives related to Ponce's climate is the treatment given to the air circulation within the living quarters. The house has high ceilings, ranging from 14 to 15 feet, to give hot air more space to rise. Adorned ventilation holes are strategically located at the four corners of every room's ceiling, allowing for the heat to exit through the roof and letting the cool air circulate throughout the entire house. The fresh air is captured at the roof through a set of brick and masonry ventilation structures, oriented in an east-to-west direction (the usual direction of the wind currents), and channelized to the house interior. Every single room in the house connects to the adjacent room through wooden double doors (some with louvers and shutters, other of <b>solid</b> <b>construction),</b> allowing air to circulate from one space to another. Furthermore, many of the interior doors are crowned with wooden transoms, facilitating the air conduit even with the doors closed. In addition, every single room has, at least, one wooden double door that open toward the exterior.|$|E

Between the outer spars, a second pair of reserve fuel tanks were located, carrying an individual capacity of 910L (240US gal) of fuel. The outer trailing edges were formed by the ailerons and flaps, which were met by smooth wing tips which curved forward into the leading edge. The outer leading edge sections were installed in the shape of a curved [...] "strip nosed" [...] rib, which was positioned ahead of the main spar. Most of the interior ribs were not solid, with the exception of the ribs located between the rear main spar and the flaps and ailerons. These were of <b>solid</b> <b>construction,</b> though even they had lightening holes.|$|E

A solid steel rotor with an embedded aluminum or copper cage constitutes the other version.
