50|$|In 1951 the Italian Navy {{was looking}} for a {{replacement}} for the Cristoforo Colombo (passed to the Soviet Union), bought the vessel and renamed her Palinuro. After a complete renovation the ship is used as training vessel for <b>Senior</b> <b>Ratings.</b>|$|R
50|$|The well-equipped galley, {{situated}} on 2 deck amidships, fed the whole ships company {{to a very}} high standard. The Wardroom, just to starboard, the Senior Rates Mess just aft and the Junior <b>Ratings</b> <b>mess</b> forward, all having easy access. All accommodation, except the Captains, was on 3 deck. The Junior Ratings had a 28-berth mess deck forward, the Senior Rates lived in double cabins and the Officers had a mixture of two double-berth and two single-berth cabins. All accommodation spaces were air conditioned and this coupled with good sea-keeping qualities made these ships very comfortable indeed.|$|R
50|$|Engineer Officers {{entering}} the Royal Navy {{are required to}} be graduates with a suitably numerate degree, however some may have been sponsored with the Defence Technical Undergraduate Scheme at Aston University, University of Birmingham, Loughborough University, Northumbria University, University of Newcastle upon Tyne or University of Southampton. <b>Senior</b> <b>Ratings</b> of the appropriate sub-specialisation may also be commissioned as Engineer Officers on the Senior Upper Yardman Scheme.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} support their high <b>senior</b> <b>ratings,</b> SIVs were obliged to obtain {{significant}} capital and liquidity facilities (so-called back-stop facilities) from banks to cover some of the senior issuance. This helps to reduce investor exposure to market disruptions that might prevent the SIV from refinancing its CP debt. To {{the extent that the}} SIV invests in fixed rate assets, it hedges against interest-rate risk.|$|R
50|$|From 1939, Wren uniform {{consisted}} of a double-breasted jacket and skirt, with shirt and tie, for all ranks (although similar working dress to the men could also be worn). Junior Ratings wore hats {{similar to those of}} their male counterparts (although with a more sloping top). <b>Senior</b> <b>Ratings</b> (Petty Officers and above) and officers wore tricorne hats with a white cover. All insignia, including cap badges and non-substantive (trade) badges, were blue.|$|R
50|$|The Argentine Navy dress uniform is a {{navy blue}} polo {{shirt with a}} visor cap for {{officers}} and <b>senior</b> <b>ratings</b> and sailor caps for junior ratings, epaulettes and sleeve rank marks (for all offers), a sword set and scabbard for officers, blue long pants (skirts for female personnel), a belt and black leather shoes or boots. Marines wear peaked caps with the dress uniform. Epaulettes are only worn with the dress uniform.|$|R
50|$|Frequently {{certificated}} officers, both {{deck and}} engineering, built careers within specific shipping companies and only sailed aboard ships owned by that company. They were often able to {{progress on the}} basis of being requested by a Master who had just gained his own command.Sometimes <b>senior</b> <b>ratings</b> such as Carpenters, Boatswains, Quarter Masters, Donkeymen and particularly Chief Stewards also preferred this career path and like their officers could even remain aboard a favoured ship for a decade or more.|$|R
5000|$|... "Square-rigged" [...] is {{also used}} for the uniform of a rating in the Royal Navy since 1857. It is slang and refers to anyone wearing the famous blue square collar on the {{shoulders}} and bell-bottomed trousers. The name perhaps {{reflects the fact that}} it was these men who managed the square-rigged sails. The peaked cap uniform worn by <b>Senior</b> <b>Ratings</b> (Petty Officers, Chief Petty Officers and Warrant Officers) and Officers is known colloquially as 'fore-and-aft rig'.|$|R
5000|$|This mess {{dress is}} worn {{in the evenings}} for dining by all senior rates Petty Officer and above. 2A is the formal evening dress for {{ceremonial}} dinners worn a white waistcoat and miniature medals." [...] 2B is [...] "mess undress" [...] for other mess functions, and is worn with a cummerbund and miniature medals. Those <b>senior</b> <b>ratings</b> who have not applied for mess dress may in lieu wear 1C dress with a black bow tie substituted for the black tie.|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept was}} refined in the {{chartered}} trawlers HMS St David and HMS Venturer, {{and a total}} of twelve vessels, all named after British rivers, were constructed by Richards Shipbuilders at Lowestoft and Great Yarmouth at an approximate unit cost of £4.6 million. The class was designed to operate in deep water and ocean environments, if necessary {{for long periods of time}} without support. The complement was 5 officers, 7 <b>Senior</b> <b>Ratings,</b> and 16 Junior Ratings, although additional accommodation meant that a total crew of 36 could be borne for training purposes.|$|R
5000|$|The rum ration, or [...] "tot", {{consisted}} of 1/8 imppt mL of rum at 95.5 proof (54.6% ABV), given out to every sailor at midday. <b>Senior</b> <b>Ratings</b> (Petty Officers and above) received their rum neat, whilst for Junior Ratings it was diluted with {{two parts of}} water to make 3/8 imppt mL of grog. [...] The rum ration was served from one particular barrel, {{also known as the}} [...] "Rum Tub" [...] which was ornately decorated and was made of oak, reinforced with brass bands, with brass letters saying, [...] "The Queen, God Bless Her".|$|R
50|$|A {{total of}} 253 {{managers}} from 11 organisations {{went through the}} video-based assessment. Their overall proficiency percentiles (average of the 12 competency scores) were compared with their <b>senior</b> managers’ <b>ratings</b> of their performance at work, using the Spearman's rank order correlation analysis.|$|R
5000|$|In September 1931, {{as part of}} its {{attempts}} to deal with the Great Depression, the new National Government launched cuts to public spending. In the Navy this translated into a 10% pay cut (matching 10% cuts across the board for public sector workers) for officers and <b>senior</b> <b>ratings,</b> and for junior ratings on the [...] "new rate" [...] of pay, introduced for new entrants in 1925. Ratings below petty officer who had joined before 1925 would have their pay reduced to the same level, amounting to a 25% cut. On top of this, many Labour Party supporters shared the sense of betrayal felt in the labour movement at Ramsay MacDonald's split with the Labour Party and his formation of a new government with the Conservatives.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{torpedo boat}} destroyers were small, to maximize maneuverability, and powered by large steam engines, to maximize speed to intercept enemy torpedo boats {{before they could}} {{get close to the}} battleships. These torpedo boat destroyers were so full of machinery, coal, quick-firing guns and ammunition that there was not enough room for living quarters for their crew. Destroyer tenders with berthing and dining accommodations for the destroyer crews joined the fleet train of colliers accompanying the battle fleet. The destroyer tenders also carried cooks, administrative and medical personnel, and <b>senior</b> <b>ratings</b> qualified to repair the destroyer machinery. Although individual destroyers were too small for these specialized personnel, the skills of those aboard the tender were available to the whole destroyer flotilla. The tender also carried a supply of spare parts for destroyer machinery.|$|R
5000|$|All Yeoman Warders are retired {{members of}} the armed services; to be appointed, one must be [...] "a former Warrant Officer, class 1 or 2, (or the {{equivalent}} rank in other services) and in exceptional circumstances, a Staff Sergeant" [...] from the Royal Navy, British Army, Royal Air Force, or Royal Marines; must have earned the Long Service and Good Conduct Medal; and must have served for 22 years in the regular armed services. Until 2009, sailors were ineligible to become Yeomen Warders. This was because sailors of the Royal Navy - unlike soldiers, marines, and airmen - swear an oath of allegiance to the Admiralty rather than the monarch personally. In 2009, sailors became eligible to join the Yeoman Warders after the Queen consented to a petition from the Governor of the Tower to allow Royal Navy <b>senior</b> <b>ratings</b> to serve.|$|R
5000|$|Other navies {{abolished}} the grog allowance far earlier (the United States Navy after the American Civil War), but the order persisted, allowing {{the crew to}} take another drink in place of rum or grog; in 1845 it is recorded as being substituted for the more rowdy [...] "Crossing the Line" [...] ceremony. The Royal New Zealand Navy was the last navy to issue junior and <b>senior</b> <b>ratings</b> a daily tot of rum, issuing its last daily rum ration on 1 March 1990. Today the Royal Canadian Navy is more generous with the allowances, allowing crew members to take 87.5 ml of spirits compared with the 62.5 ml allowed by the Royal Navy, although the Royal Navy does make allowance for paucity of supplies, permitting two 350 ml cans of beer to be issued if commercial spirits are not available.|$|R
50|$|The Royal Navy's medal {{was instituted}} in 1919, for gallantry {{not in the}} face of the enemy and for meritorious service by petty {{officers}} and <b>senior</b> naval <b>ratings.</b> As a gallantry award, it was superseded by the Empire Gallantry Medal in 1928, but resumed in 1977. It is now awarded to senior NCOs in the Royal Navy, Royal Marines, Women's Royal Naval Service and Queen Alexandra's Royal Naval Nursing Service.|$|R
50|$|On {{the morning}} of 15 September, Repulse sailed on time at 06:30, but sailors on the other four capital ships due to sail {{had already begun to}} refuse orders. On Hood and Nelson, crews carried out the {{ordinary}} harbour routine, refusing to put to sea; on Valiant and Rodney, crews carried out only essential duties, including the provision of safety patrols and fire guards, and did so without any recourse to their officers. Throughout the day, cheering crowds massed on the forecastles of all ships except Centurion and Exeter; on Rodney, a piano was dragged on deck and songs were sung. Officers, who issued orders and threats through loudspeakers, were ignored and ridiculed. Valiant unmoored and attempted to put to sea with a limited number of men on duty, but was unable to proceed. On Tomkinson′s own ship, Hood, crew members prevented officers and <b>senior</b> <b>ratings</b> from unmooring the ship. Even Royal Marines, expected to enforce discipline and break up any mutiny, joined the strike. Tomkinson suspended the exercises until further notice, cancelled all leave and called for the investigations of complaints to proceed as quickly as possible. Warspite, Malaya and Repulse were ordered to return to harbour.|$|R
5000|$|Long-Term Credit Ratings {{assess the}} ability of an {{insurance}} company, holding company or other legal entity to meet its <b>senior</b> obligations. <b>Ratings</b> from [...] "aa" [...] to [...] "ccc" [...] sometimes are enhanced with a [...] "+" [...] (plus) or [...] "−" [...] (minus) to indicate whether the issuer is near the top or bottom of a category, and may be designated as Under Review ("u") when recent positive, negative or developing events dictate the rating {{may be subject to}} change in the near term.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of the Special Duties List in 1956, some <b>senior</b> <b>ratings</b> were selected for promotion to Warrant Officer on the Branch List, with subsequent possible promotion (from 1864) to Commissioned Warrant Officer; from 1946, officer rank was achieved by commission rather than by warrant. Of the old [...] "standing officers" [...] (the master, boatswain, gunner and carpenter) from the days of sail, the cook was the first to lose his status as a full-blown warrant officer and head of his own department; indeed, an order of 1704 helped him in his downward career as, in future, in the appointment of cooks, the Navy Board was [...] "to give the preference to such cripples and maimed persons as are pensioners of the chest at Chatham". Warrant officers lived in a separate mess - the gunroom - from Wardroom officers and, by the 1800s, wore one thin stripe of gold sleeve lace with, from 1864, for supply branch officers, the white distinction cloth below. The warrant officer's dress uniform was instituted in 1787. In all other respects they were treated as for commissioned officers. A commissioned warrant officer wore the same sleeve lace as a sub-lieutenant - one gold stripe proper; these officers lived in the Wardroom mess.|$|R
50|$|The normal {{complement}} was 36, {{composed of}} officers and <b>senior</b> and junior <b>ratings.</b> Among the departments, the PO (Supply) {{was responsible for}} 5,000 stores line items {{as well as for}} food and drink, clothing and bedding. The RISC (Royal Fleet Auxiliary Interim Stores Computer) system was his only assistant on board.|$|R
50|$|In 1998, Messing {{played a}} lead {{role as the}} biolanthropologist Sloan Parker on ABC's {{dramatic}} science fiction television series Prey. During this time, her agent approached her with the pilot script for the television show Will & Grace. Messing was inclined {{to take some time}} off, but the script intrigued her, and she auditioned for the role of Grace Adler, beating out Nicollette Sheridan, who later guest-starred on the show as Grace's romantic rival. Will & Grace became a <b>ratings</b> success, and <b>Messing</b> became a star.|$|R
50|$|Before {{making the}} {{assessment}} available to clients, Cliff Lansley, {{one of the}} developers of MAP validated the methodology in 11 organisations. Managers were selected to cover {{the full range of}} proficiency at work from ‘excellent’ to ‘below average’. Working independently, three <b>senior</b> managers assigned <b>ratings</b> on a 5-point scale to each manager being assessed, thereby establishing a rank order.|$|R
50|$|The second {{avenue of}} {{promotion}} from rating to commissioned officer {{was to the}} Special Duties (SD) List. Petty officers and chief petty officers could, {{with the approval of}} their commanding officer, become a CW candidate (an 'SD candidate') and such supply branch <b>senior</b> <b>ratings</b> were similarly specially reported on with a view to promotion to officer, generally between the ages of 28 and 35, though most were in their early 30s when promoted to acting sub-lieutenant on the Special Duties List. Unlike GL and SL (see below) officers, SD officers retained their former rating branch specialisation; for example the supply officer (cash) of a large warship or shore establishment would typically be a lieutenant (SD)(S)(W), the (W) indicating that he is a commissioned officer from the Writer branch of ratings. SD officers were, of course, promoted from all supply branches - writer (W), stores assistant/accountant (S) or (V), cook (CK), officer's steward/steward or caterer (CA). Once confirmed as a Sub-lieutenant, an SD officer was promoted lieutenant after three years; promotion to lieutenant-commander (SD) was by selection and, from these, a very small number were promoted to commander from 1966 onwards. Retirement was generally compulsory at age 50. A few SD officers were further selected for transfer to the General List, seniority being adjusted on transfer, so as to level the promotion opportunities (generally these officers were earmarked as likely to reach the rank of commander). In the 1970s, to make up for certain branch shortages, some chief petty officers, age over 35, from the supply branch were selected and promoted temporary acting sub-lieutenant (SD), a few of whom were later promoted to temporary lieutenant (SD). By the 1980s, supply officers were no longer necessarily being appointed according to the List they were on (GL, SD or SL); it was not uncommon to find, in different ships in the same squadron or flotilla, a pusser in supply charge from each List.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} impact of bank-specific {{financial}} indicators and macroeconomic variables on bank <b>senior</b> unsecured <b>ratings</b> by Moody’s. Controlling for bank financial characteristics, we find significant evidence of procyclicality in bank ratings stemming from lagged interaction effects between the real output gap and the credit gap. In particular, macroeconomic slowdowns that follow credit booms tend to imply lower ratings. Similarly, when credit expansion above a trend is followed by strong economic performance, bank ratings tend to increase. Bank ratings also appear to correlate positively with {{the slope of the}} yield curve and tend to increase with sovereign ratings, market share of lending, and bank size. Given the ongoing debate on the importance, timeliness, and information content of credit ratings in general - and those assigned to banks in particular - the paper addresses a topic that is of great importance to central banks, regulators, and risk managers. ...|$|R
50|$|In 1939 all {{flag officer}} ranks were {{reinstated}} and Midshipman became the highest enlisted rating in the Navy, {{and in the}} course of the Great Patriotic War, all Redfleetmen became Seamen in another rank change. In 1943 all naval rank insignia became uniform in the fleet and ground forces. In a unique way, the ranks of the Soviet Naval Infantry, Soviet Naval Aviation and the other ground services remained absolutely army-styled similar to their Red Army counterparts but the rank insignia became uniform. The Admiral of the Fleet rank was also created by then. The rank insignia were now also seen on epaulettes: black on duty dresses and dark blue and gold on all full and ceremonial dresses for the fleet forces, with air force blue borders for the aviation branch and red borders for the coastal defense and naval infantry branch. In 1952 the <b>senior</b> enlisted <b>rating's</b> insignia (until 1972, Midshipman and from then on, Chief Ship Petty Officer) changed to its final design.|$|R
5000|$|Depending {{upon the}} size of the vessel it might have a Fourth Mate, Fifth Mate, and so on. The largest ocean liners could have Senior and Junior levels of each rate of Mate as far as 10th Mate.The Ship's Carpenter and Boatswain (Bosun) were the <b>senior</b> deck <b>ratings</b> and both were {{typically}} men of very considerable sea-going experience and personality. The Boatswain's Mate was also an experienced seaman trusted by the Boatswain and Mates {{to be able to keep}} the deck crew in hand either by force of personality or by using his fists.Able Seamen were the ship's seamen with sea-going experience, the highest ranking amongst them were the [...] "Quarter Masters" [...] who stood watches on the bridge to steer the ship.

50|$|In 1969, Fife {{took part}} in a group {{deployment}} around the world. She left Portsmouth on 1 April 1970 and sailed to Safi in Morocco; the first visit by a British warship for over a 100 years. Then to Lagos in Nigeria just {{at the end of the}} Biafran War. From Lagos to Simon's Town in South Africa. The gates of the former British Naval base still bore the royal cypher, VR. From Simon's Town, she briefly {{took part in}} the Beira Patrol off the shores of Rhodesia after Prime Minister Ian Smith declared Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence. The Beira Patrol was a naval blockade to enforce economic sanctions on the errant regime. From there she crossed the Indian Ocean and stopped off at the NATO base on the island of Gan en route to Singapore. There she spent 6 weeks in an Assisted Maintenance Period (AMP) before heading for the South China Sea to conduct the first live firings of the Sea Slug Mk2 area protection anti-aircraft missile. The ship had been refitted in Portsmouth to accommodate a larger war-load of missiles and this work was completed in Singapore where she took on live missiles. The trials were successful against US targets from bases in the Philippines. After this she went to Hong Kong and Kobe in Japan for Expo 70, before heading to Pearl Harbor on Hawaii and then on to Long Beach in California and Acapulco in Mexico and via the Panama Canal to Puerto Rico and on to the Mediterranean. She visited Toulon and spent time in Malta and Gibraltar before returning to the UK. Whilst in Hawaii, the Royal Navy abolished the rum issue. As a result, Fife became the last ship in the Navy to issue rum by virtue of being the furthest west in the Pacific. The Hawaiian media came on board and were quite bemused when the ships <b>Senior</b> <b>Ratings</b> staged a mock burial at sea, complete with a Pipers Lament provide by the ship's pipe and drum band and pall bearers dressed in black.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ship was}} {{handed over to}} the Royal New Zealand Navy on 9 July 1956. When Captain Peter Phipps went to take command of Royalist in 1955, New Zealand diplomat Frank Corner was shocked to find that Phipps agreed that the ship was a white elephant, {{completely}} unsuitable for use by the RNZN in the Pacific. Phipps claimed Royalist's range was so limited the cruiser could not even reach Tahiti without refueling. However the Type 12 frigates approved by Phipps had less endurance, meaning it would have been more logical to order longer range diesel versions of the Type 12, ie the Type 11 or T41. The improved T12 Leander ordered by the RNZN essentially was essentially a GP AA/AW picket ship for RN aircraft carriers [...] with much of the same functions as Royalist. The NZ Navy Board, of which 3 of its members were RN officers, supported the retention of a modernised cruiser force, and supported the presentation of the loan of the cruiser to PM Holland. Phipps demanded some improvements, while in command of HMS Bellona as an accommodation ship, and refused to accept the cruiser until 3 weeks later than intended by the RN Dockyard until alterations were made to the habitability of the cruiser. These notably included more showers, and some rectification of ventilation problems. With extra electronic equipment, the cruiser had no weight margin, and the priority of being ready for possible action in the Mediterranean meant the dockyard would not install the pre-wetting, ABC spraydown equipment, specifically requested by the RNZN in 1955. The dockyard responded that installing spraydown to wash nuclear fallout was possible, providing a wall size copy of the plan of the pre-wetting system under installation in HMS Sheffield, and suggested the NZ dockyard could do the job. Royalist had extra communications systems and an AIO (Action Information Office) fitted in 1943-45 to 13 other Town, Fiji and Minotaur class cruisers, doubling the effectiveness of its armament in the RN postwar assessment, but less space for <b>senior</b> <b>ratings</b> and petty office, than RNZN's earlier Dido cruisers.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the value of {{external}} knowledge sharing increases when work groups are more structurally diverse. A structurally diverse work group is one in which the members, by virtue of their different organizational affiliations, roles, or positions, can expose the group to unique sources of knowledge. It is hypothesized that if members of structurally diverse work groups engage in external knowledge sharing, their performance will improve because of this active exchange of knowledge through unique external sources. A field study of 182 work groups in a Fortune 500 telecommunications firm operationalizes structural diversity as member differences in geographic locations, functional assignments, reporting managers, and business units, as indicated by corporate database records. External knowledge sharing was measured with group member surveys and performance was assessed using <b>senior</b> executive <b>ratings.</b> Ordered logit analyses showed that external knowledge sharing was more strongly associated with performance when work groups were more structurally diverse. Implications for theory and practice around the integration of work groups and social networks are addresse...|$|R
5000|$|The {{class was}} also criticised for being overcrowded - at 384 ft (117 m), they had 177 crewmen {{compared}} to 436 ft (133 m) and just 185 crewmen {{for the modern}} Type 23 frigate. This was important {{at a time when}} the Royal Navy was facing a manpower shortage. The standard of accommodation for the officers was better than the RN average and the <b>senior</b> <b>ratings</b> enjoyed separate cabins - unlike the petty officers of the Type 42 destroyer of the same era, who slept in bunk rooms. The ratings' accommodation was also improved, with four-man sleeping berths leading off from the communal mess deck; again, far better than those of the Type 42 destroyer. In essence, the standard of accommodation and fitting were better, especially for officers, because it was a design intended to attract export orders. It is very little more than a stretched version of the MK 7 Vospers frigate built for third world Libya and, other than the fitting of CAAIS, with its electronic and intended weapon fit essentially the same as the Mk 7 prototype in type or level of sophistication. Higher automation and the new Mk 8 4.5 inch automatic gun combined with, in many ways, a much simpler electronic fit than the Leanders or Type 42, the new Type 21 class lacked both the long range radar, the Type 965, carried by most UK warships or the Limbo mortar and it associated sonar. Inevitably, that meant a much smaller crew than the Leanders, with little capability to modernise (owing to its small size) and already being close to its topweight limit; the Type 21's days were numbered. A decision not to modernize them was made in 1979 [...] even before the Falklands losses. The several hundred tons of ballast that had to be carried low down meant that the frigates could not usually achieve their planned 35 knots speed for any long distance, but the ships were all still good for a dramatic 37 knot burst speed, with two ships claiming to have exceeded 40 knots on more than one occasion. Nevertheless, these ships were regarded favorably by their crews and proved to be highly maneuverable and reliable assets in a navy suffering depletion in the number of modern escort hulls.|$|R

They were normally divided into two groups, the Firemen and the Trimmers. The firemen were the men who stood watches in the stokehold feeding tons of coal into the furnaces beneath the boilers to keep up a head of steam. The trimmers were the men who spent their lives in the ship's bunkers (the hold which held the coal) and were responsible for loading barrows of coal with which they ran across planks of wood to the stokehold to maintain the piles of coal beside the men feeding the furnaces. They had to keep the level of coal within the bunkers trimmed (level) to prevent the ship becoming unstable.|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{recent development}} in U. S. capital markets is the tremendous {{growth in the}} secondary market trading of syndicated loans. This paper uses a unique trading data set for syndicated loans over the period 1997 to 2003 to empirically investigate two major issues. First, we present a statistical overview of the recent growth in the secondary market trading of syndicated loans. Second, we examine the determinants {{of which syndicated loans}} {{are most likely to be}} traded in the secondary market using binomial logistic regression models. We find that syndicated loans that are larger, have longer maturities, are underwritten by larger syndicates, and are used for debt repayment, takeovers, and leveraged buyouts are more likely to be traded. Lender reputation plays an important role as well, with loans originated by very active lenders more likely to be traded. We also find that syndicated loans made to borrowers with only <b>senior</b> debt <b>ratings</b> are more likely to be traded in the secondary market than loans made to borrowers with both a debt rating and equity that trades in a stock exchange. This result most likely reflects the growing demand of institutional investors for the higher yields of levered and highly levered syndicated loans made to riskier opaque borrowers with less available market information...|$|R
