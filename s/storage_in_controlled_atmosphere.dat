40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of 1 -methylcyclopropene (1 -MCP) treatment and ultra-low oxygen (ULO) storage conditions on the sensory characteristics of apples. Two apple storage technologies were tested in this study: cold storage under traditional conditions in combination with 1 -MCP treatment, and ULO storage with two different compositions of a gas mixture. Apples were stored for 6 months. After storage, the sensory characteristics were analysed. Sensory evaluation showed that storage technology affected the sensory characteristics and panelists’ acceptability. Distinctive differences were found between apples stored under controlled atmosphere and traditional conditions. Trained panelists highlighted that samples stored under controlled atmosphere had pronounced juiciness and color, while 1 -MCP-treated apples stored in cold were sweeter and more aromatic. Apples of the autumn cultivar ‘Auksis’, was perceived considerably higher after harvest and before long-term storage, compared with other cultivars. During 6 months of <b>storage</b> <b>in</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> the sensory quality of these apples remained intact. Also, the sensory quality of fruit of the winter cultivar ‘Sinap Orlovskij’ throughout 6 months of its <b>storage</b> <b>in</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>atmosphere</b> remained intact. Besides, it was noticed that apples stored in controlled atmosphere were juicier and more aromatic with intense color. There is a positive effect of 1 -MCP treatment on maintenance of apple quality stored in normal atmosphere for 6 months. With regard to some quality parameters and sensory attributes, 1 -MCP-treated apples stored under normal atmosphere are comparable to those stored under ULO conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the use of controlled atmospheres (CA) to extend postharvest fruit quality of fresh sweet and sour cherry cultivated in some areas of South-eastern part of Romania. Fruits were harvested at an export maturity stage and packed in a 5 -kg wooden box with a perforated polyethylene liner. Fruits were stored in three experimental conditions: 1 - chilly rooms (V 1, V 4), 2 - cold storage and normal atmosphere (V 2, V 5), 3 - cold storage and controlled atmosphere (V 3, V 6). The V 0 variant is the stage immediately after harvest of the fresh fruits, when the fruits are perfectly balanced for fresh consumption. Fruit samples were evaluated at harvest, after 5 days of storage in chilly rooms, 20 days of in cold storage with normal atmosphere, and after 45 days of <b>storage</b> <b>in</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> A sensory evaluation was conducted with a trained panel of 6 members, evaluating the general aspect and taste of fruits.

40|$|ABSTRACT Yerba mate shows {{social and}} {{economic}} importance for the Southern Latin American countries due to its easy production and large market range. However, {{there is a problem}} to harvest the yerba mate at the correct period and to store it until processing and marketing. Thus, the aim of this paper was to evaluate the interaction among the <b>storage</b> <b>in</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> effect of cultivation form and shelf life period on yerba mate quality after long-term controlled atmosphere storage. The experiment was conducted in a factorial arrangement (3 controlled atmosphere conditions × 2 cultivation forms × 4 weeks of shelf life). Native yerba mate, stored under controlled atmosphere, showed higher chlorophyll concentration as compared to the cultivated one. Carotenoid concentration increased up to the third week of shelf life and thereafter remained constant, if the yerba mate was stored under ambient conditions. Oxygen partial pressure lowering allows long-term yerba mate storage, keeping its quality during four shelf life weeks at 20 °C. Controlled atmosphere is an efficient technique for yerba mate quality keeping during long-term storage and shelf life, allowing the harvest of the raw material at the correct period and the maintenance of its quality until processing and marketing. The cultivation form has a significant effect on the storage and shelf life potential of yerba mate stored under controlled atmosphere...|$|E

Experiments were implemented successfully with the pressure-controlled method, in which samples were submitted to an air-flow of very high velocity (similar to 10 m/s) for 48 h. The results showed no significant effect of picking date and storage period. The effect of temperature {{was evident in the}} RH range above 91 % for the inner cortex tissue, but much less for the outer cortex tissue. The difference in sorption isotherms of different tissues is quite obvious. The cuticle showed a non-hygroscopic behaviour, while the inner and outer cortex tissues showed the opposite. The inner cortex tissue had a hi-her water holding capability than the outer cortex tissue, which indicates the more protective properties of the latter against temperature and relative humidity fluctuations during storage. The water content change versus water activity was also stronger in the case of inner cortex tissue. In an attempt to relate the moisture distribution (water content) to the water status (potential) in pears and, to understand water movement in fresh fruit, a detailed modelling of the cellular structural properties and of the intercellular space is a necessity.

40|$|Apple {{fruit is}} a major crop that can be {{supplied}} year-round due to low temperature <b>storage</b> <b>in</b> a <b>controlled</b> <b>atmosphere</b> with a reduced oxygen concentration and an increased carbon dioxide concentration. The low temperature and dedicated gas concentration levels are designed to provide optimal conditions that prevent ripening while maintaining the fundamental respiratory metabolism necessary for energy supply in the cells that ensures cell and tissue integrity during storage of the fruit. If the concentration of oxygen is too low or that of carbon dioxide too high, a fermentation metabolism is induced that causes the production of off-flavours, results in insufficient energy supply, leading to cell collapse and consequent tissue browning and cavity formation. The microstructural arrangement of cells and intercellular spaces in the apple create specific pathways for transport of the respiratory gasses oxygen and carbon dioxide. We used X-ray CT to characterise {{the changes in the}} microstructure of ‘Braeburn’ apple during the development of internal storage disorders. Multiscale modeling was applied to understand the changes in oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations and respiration and fermentation rates in the apple during the disorder development <b>in</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>atmosphere</b> <b>storage</b> of ‘Braeburn’ apple fruit. The 3 D microstructure geometries of healthy, brown tissue and tissue with cavities were created to solve the micro-scale gasexchange model for O 2 and CO 2 using the finite volume method.

The essential {{free amino acids}} in the highest concentrations were threonine, leucine, valine, lysine and arginine, all over 40 mg/ 100 g. Threonine, valine, lysine and arginine concentrations decreased significantly (p< 0. 05) during storage. These decreases were more pronounced in the lots kept in the CO 2 -rich mix (1) than the lots kept in the O 2 -rich mix (2) and this was independent of whether the storage was under controlled (C) or modified (M) atmosphere. The dipeptide anserine showed decreases with the same trend. The most abundant non-essential FAAs were glycine, alanine and glutamic acid (57. 9, 57. 2 and 31. 2 mg/ 100 g, respectively), along with the dipeptide anserine (52. 9 mg/ 100 g). The non-essential FAAs presented differences attributable to the gas mixes used. No differences were detected {{in any of the}} FAA groups studied with respect to the different types of atmospheres (C or M). Only ornithine and tryptophan levels increased significantly (p< 0. 05) in the course of storage. These increases were significantly (p< 0. 05) different only <b>in</b> the <b>control</b> lot.

LeM and MoM apples were {{measured in the}} 630 - 900 nm range by TRS, and analysed for sensory profile (firm, crispy, juicy, mealy) and pulp mechanical characteristics (firmness, stiffness, energy-to-rupture). All data were processed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). According to sensory intensity scores, fruits were either divided into five classes (very low – VL; low – L; medium – M; high – H; very high – VH) separately for every attribute, or clustered into four groups, each one representing a specific sensory profile. The absorption spectra showed a maximum at 670 nm (chlorophyll-a) and μa 670 was higher in the VH class for firm, crispy and juicy and in the VL and L classes for mealy. The scattering spectra had a decreasing trend with the wavelength increase, and μs’ values were lower in the VH class for firm and crispy, and higher in the VH class for mealy and in the VL ones for juicy. PCA underlined that μs’ values were negatively related to firmness and μa 670, and that μa 690, μa 730, μa 830, μa 850 and μa 900 were opposed to mealiness.

40|$|Apple <b>storage</b> <b>in</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>atmosphere</b> (CA) can {{increase}} the marketing window of apples {{but at the same}} time it is an expensive practice and on the basis of cultivar, season, harvest time and storage condition (low O 2, low/high CO 2, low temperature) apples can develop different physiological disorders. It appears as a darkened area due to necrosis of hypodermal cells especially in Granny Smith and Red Delicious cultivars. Superficial scald annually causes the major economic loss to apple growers worldwide. It can arise after a relative long period (2 - 4 months) of cold storage with an increase in severity when apples are removed from storage and are leaved at room temperature (ca 7 dd). It is also influenced by different preharvest factors including fruit ripening at harvest, environmental conditions during growth, ethylene action or fruit mineral content. Superficial scald is associated with the accumulation of volatiles, in particular of α-farnesene, the biosynthesis of which is influenced by ethylene. This compound can be oxidized along with the storage period to a group of molecules called conjugated trienols. The accumulation of these oxidative products can induce metabolic dysfunction and cell death. Different strategies are provided to successfully inhibit scald development. The most common techniques in use combine storage in control atmosphere (CA) with treatments with the antioxidant diphenylamine (DPA), or with 1 -methylcyclopropene (1 -MCP), an inhibitor of ethylene perception and the most effective molecule to control scald, or application of an initial low oxygen stress (ILOS), followed by CA storage. In 2011 the use of DPA has been banned in Europe for health concerns, 1 -MCP is effective but has high costs, while ILOS is difficult to apply requiring more research for its optimization and apples cannot be stored for long periods. The identification of the molecular mechanism involved in the regulation of superficial scald development may allow the possibility to predict at harvest, before CA storage, which apple batches may probably develop the disorder allowing rational storage strategies with significant economic gains. The aim of this work was to provide a preliminary characterization of the molecular factors putatively involved in scald development associated with ethylene action and ROS metabolism, two actors that seem to have a role in scald occurrence, in peels of apples, cv Granny Smith, treated or not with 1 -MCP or DPA and stored in controlled atmosphere for 1, 3 or 6 months. For this purpose gene families involved in the maintenance of ROS homeostasis were identified in the apple genome. In particular ROPs and ancillary proteins ROP-GEFs, -GAPs and -GDIs, RBOHs (NADPH oxidases involved in the generation of ROS at the apoplastic levels) and PLsDα (involved togheter with ROPs in the regulation of RBOHs activity) were identified. It is known in fact that Arabidopsis cells during oxygen deprivation activate a mechanism controlled by negative feedback regulation which involves ROPs, ROP-GAPs, RBOH and H 2 O 2, and it is termed the ROP-GAP rheostat. Expression analyses on the identified genes evaluated by real-time PCR allowed the identification of 2 ROPs, 7 ROP-GEFs, 8 ROP-GAPs, 2 RBOHs and 2 PLsDα de-repressed in samples treated with 1 -MCP and in most cases with a minor extent, by DPA treatment. The expression of the same genes was evaluated by qPCR on peels of apples subjected to short-time treatments with a saturating concentration (100 ppm) of ethylene for 4 and 24 hours showing that ethylene negatively regulates many of the apple ROP-GAP rheostat genes including RBOHs and PLsDα. Then analyses of content of malonyldialdehyde, a marker of lipid peroxidation, H 2 O 2, ascorbate and glutathione, suggested that cells of untreated apples, which showed scald symptoms in the 97 % of cases after 6 months of storage, perceived the oxidative stress associated with the loss of H 2 O 2 homeostasis. On the contrary samples treated with 1 -MCP showed higher levels of H 2 O 2 thus maintaining the H 2 O 2 homeostasis. This finding was further confirmed by the up-regulation of transcription of alcohol dehydrogenase, a marker of H 2 O 2 response. The subcellular localization of H 2 O 2, obtained by means of cerium chloride reaction through transmission electron microscopy, revealed higher levels of H 2 O 2 in the apoplast of apple peels treated with 1 -MCP compared to control ones, confirming a role of RBOHs and their regulative system on control of apoplastic H 2 O 2 homeostasis. Finally RNA-seq analyses on the same samples, allowed to construct an heatmap that highlighted in samples treated with 1 -MCP a co-regulation between genes of the ROP-GAP rheostat and of the ROP system, and genes belonging to the ascorbate, dehydroascorbate reductase and thioredoxin families, involved respectively in the detoxification or protection of thiol groups by ROS action. These results demonstrate for the first time that during cold stress ethylene induces in apples that develop scald a disruption of ROS homeostasis caused by the loss of ROP-GAP rheostat and RBOHs regulation, thus provoking a different transcriptional response of genes involved in ROS detoxification...|$|E

Freshly harvested fruit and fruit removed from storage {{were treated with}} 130 mul/l propylene or propylene-free air for 9 days at 20 degreesC. Fruit treated with propylene at 20 degreesC at harvest produced ethylene with a tag period of 3 days, had concomitant 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (ACC) production, 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylate synthase (ACC synthase) and 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylate oxidase (ACC oxidase) activities, and were ripe after 3 - 5 days while fruit not treated with propylene {{were not able to}} produce ethylene and ripen during the 9 days experiment. AS fruit softened faster during the first 60 days of storage. This effect was reduced in CA and ULO treatments. The soluble solids content (SSC) increased markedly during the first 60 days of storage and remained almost constant thereafter in all treatments. After 9 days shelf life, only AS and CA stored fruit were ripe. Fruit from ULO storage required propylene treatment to ripen fully. When kiwifruit were placed at 20 degreesC, after 60, 120 or 180 days storage at 0 degreesC, there was an induction of ethylene production with no tag period in fruit from AS or CA, with or without propylene. There was some ACC content and ACC synthase activity after 60 days storage for all treatments, while ACC oxidase activity increased only upon rewarming of the fruit in AS or CA. Kiwifruit removed from ULO-storage showed drastically reduced capacity to produce ethylene mainly due to low ACC oxidase activity rather than reduced ACC production or ACC synthase activity. Respiration increased upon rewarming of the fruit in all treatments. With storage time, there was a decrease in the capacity of the warmed fruit to produce ethylene and CO(2) {{as well as in the}} activities of ACC synthase and ACC oxidase, mostly after 60 days storage.

During a nine-month storing period, the samples’ mass was monitored monthly while oil content, free fatty acids (FFA) content and seed moisture were determined before and after storing. Storing <b>in</b> conditions without <b>atmosphere</b> <b>control</b> showed that the samples’ mass was increasing during the first four months, in the following three months it was decreasing, and then stagnated {{until the end of the}} storing period. Samples stored <b>in</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>atmosphere</b> showed variations <b>in</b> mass, with minor oscillations during the whole storing period, which resulted in lower FFA content in comparison with the samples stored <b>in</b> facilities without <b>atmosphere</b> <b>control.</b> The oil content after storing in both facilities decreased, and FFA content rose in all samples. In conclusion; storing <b>in</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>atmosphere</b> gave better results in terms of rapeseed quality...|$|R
