5|$|Marge {{dreams that}} she has {{sent a letter to}} Martha Stewart asking for her to help save the family's Christmas. Martha {{promptly}} arrives and fills the house with the Christmas decorations Marge has always dreamed of, but the other family members end up as part of the decorations instead of being able to enjoy the holiday with her. Marge quickly realizes that it is Homer and the children that make Christmas special for her, so Martha gets rid of all the decorations with a magic wand. Marge then wakes up on Christmas Day to find that her family has brought her the ingredients for breakfast in bed. Their attempts to cook it go awry, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> out for breakfast instead.|$|E
5|$|In 1649, {{the town}} is witness to many witch burnings. In the church, the townspeople {{try to figure out}} whom to condemn next. People begin accusing others and soon they erupt into chaos, until Marge intervenes. She tries to talk sense into the townspeople, but Moe accuses her of being a witch. Quimby assures her that she is {{entitled}} to due process which means she will be thrown off a cliff with a broomstick; if she is a witch she will be able to fly to safety, in which case the authorities expect her to report back for punishment. If she is not a witch, then she will fall to an honorable Christian death. After being shoved off the cliff, Marge flies up on the broomstick revealing that she really is a witch and vows to conquer the whole entire town. She returns to her sisters Patty and Selma. The sisters watch Ned and Maude Flanders talking about how the witches eat children, which gives them the notion to do just that. They knock on the Flanders' door and demand their sons, but before they leave, Maude offers the witches gingerbread men instead. The witches like these better than the children <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> to each house, getting goodies in exchange for not eating the children. As they fly off, the Sea Captain says that is how the tradition of Halloween and trick-or-treating started.|$|E
5|$|The {{taxi driver}} and his {{companion}} hold Homer hostage {{deep into the}} rainforest. They force Homer {{to make a phone}} call to Marge, telling her that if the family provides 50,000 dollars to the kidnappers, he will be released. However, the Simpsons do not have enough money <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> looking for Homer instead. Walking through the streets of Rio de Janeiro, they run into a parade that features a Teleboobies float with characters from the show. Lisa is surprised to discover that Ronaldo is working inside the costume of the dancing flamingo from Teleboobies—a well-paid job he got after learning to dance with the shoes he bought with Lisa's donation money. Ronaldo tells Lisa that he stopped writing to her because he did not know which state she lives in, since it was the orphanage that used to send his letters. Later, Ronaldo gives the Simpsons the money they need to save Homer. Meanwhile, Homer shows the kidnappers a scrapbook he made of his kidnapping memories. Apparently, he has developed Stockholm syndrome. The family and the kidnappers then meet up high over a valley near the Sugarloaf Mountain in two separate cable cars. The Simpsons toss the kidnappers their money, and when Homer jumps into his family's cable car, the cables break, sending the family crashing into the mountainside and rolling down to the ground. They all survive unharmed, but Bart is then eaten whole by an anaconda. The episode ends with Bart dancing inside the snake to carnival music.|$|E

25|$|In episode 2, Kat and Alfie {{are invited}} to Lance's wake by Peter, and when {{speaking}} to Agnes and Lance's daughter, Eileen Harrington (Angeline Ball), Kat realises that Andrew cannot be her son. Agnes confronts Kat and Alfie, so Kat realises that Lance told her why they are there. Agnes says Kat gave up her right to see her son when she gave him up, but Kat explains {{she did not know}} she had a son as she had passed out during the birth. Dermott and Tommy hear this, and Tommy asks if he has a big brother. Later, Kat and Alfie decide to return to Spain, but Tommy wants to find his brother. Tommy sneaks out of the house, and Kat and Alfie try to find him. Andrew's mother, Roisín Kelly (Maria Doyle Kennedy), tells Kat that she saw Tommy at the church, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> there, followed by Agnes. They find Dermott praying with Tommy, who tells Kat that he found his brother. Kat realises that Dermott is her son, and Dermott confirms this. In episode 3, Kat and Dermott have bonded, but she lies to him about who his real father is. Dermott worries that Tommy will tell Peter the truth and threatens him. Alfie realises that Kat lied to Dermott, which results in an argument. Dermott overhears them arguing about him not knowing the truth and Kat refusing to tell him.|$|E
500|$|Lisa {{finds out}} {{on the last day}} of school how unpopular she is when nobody signs her yearbook. Meanwhile, Ned Flanders offers the Simpson family the use of his beach house over the summer. Marge likes the idea and {{suggests}} that Bart should bring Milhouse and that Lisa should bring a friend too. However, Lisa has no friends to bring and decides to change her image as a result. After reaching the beach house, Lisa tells Marge that she forgot to pack, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> shopping for new clothes. Lisa buys a new set of clothes that she believes will make her look [...] "cool", and goes to look for some cool children.|$|E
500|$|An American sailor, Tom Wilson (Frank Borzage), whose {{ship has}} been wrecked {{in a storm}} comes to them for help and shelter. Wilson {{falls in love with}} Toya and teaches her about Christianity. To the consternation of her father, Toya decides to convert and marry Tom at the local Japanese-American mission. However, her father also converts. The locals, who have been stirred up by Takeo, go on a murderous rampage against the family. They first go to the chapel but the newlyweds evade them and <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> to the beach house instead. When the mob reaches his house, Yamaki throws out the Buddha statue he had set up in his house and puts a cross in its place. The villagers are infuriated by this; they beat him to death beneath the cross and burn his house. Eventually, the volcano erupts and the village is {{destroyed}}, and Takeo dies in an avalanche. Only Tom Wilson and Toya San survive. They are taken away from the destroyed village by a United States merchant vessel. At the end of the film, Tom tells his bride, [...] "Your gods may be powerful, Toya San, but mine has proved his omnipotence. You are saved to perpetuate your race." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{other girls}} {{involved}} in the incident join Abigail and a briefly roused Betty, who attempts {{to jump out of}} the window. Abigail coerces and threatens the others to [...] "stick to their story" [...] of merely dancing in the woods. The other girls are frightened of the truth being revealed (that in actuality, they tried to conjure a curse against Elizabeth Proctor) and being labelled witches, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> along with Abigail. Betty then faints back into unconsciousness.|$|E
2500|$|On 12 November, Churchill {{returned}} to the topic. Speaking in the Address in Reply debate, after giving some specific instances of Germany's war preparedness, he said [...] "The Government simply cannot make up their mind or they cannot get the Prime Minister to make up his mind. <b>So</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> on in strange paradox, decided only to be undecided, resolved to be irresolute, adamant for drift, solid for fluidity, all powerful for impotency. And so we go on preparing more months more years precious perhaps vital for the greatness of Britain for the locusts to eat." [...] Robert Rhodes James called this one of Churchill's most brilliant speeches during this period, Baldwin's reply sounding weak and disturbing the House. The exchange gave new encouragement to the Arms and the Covenant Movement.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, Master Hodge, {{praying and}} plundering; <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> on," [...] {{returned}} the Major, knocking the ashes {{out of his}} pipe, preparatory to filling it anew; an employment that gave him an opportunity to give vent to his feelings, without pausing to puff.--"Ay, Master Hodge, praying and plundering; <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> on. Now, do you remember old Watson, {{who was in the}} Massachusetts Levies, in the year '12?--old Tom Watson; he that was a sub under Barnwell, in our Tuscarora expedition?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Wretched creatures!" [...] {{said the}} old man, pitifully. [...] "Yes, and they drink too. Drink waters so hot and so terrible that they burn their mouths and their insides, and <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> mad." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> on; Deputy, as a rear rank one, taking open order, and invading {{the silence}} of the hour and place by stoning every wall, post, pillar, and other inanimate object, by the deserted way.|$|E

60|$|Thus {{therefore}} they are allured, and think to defile {{her in the}} bed of love; but coming to her, and finding of her chaste, and filled with nothing but armour, and men at arms, to maintain her chastity, nolens volens--their fleshly love is turned into cruel rage, and <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> to variance.|$|E
6000|$|<b>So</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> buzzing {{along the}} lighted {{boulevard}} looking for [...] "something real wicked." [...] What {{they want is}} to see something really and truly wicked; they don't know just what, but [...] "something bad."

60|$|And <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> to Abraham's bosom, Madam. They should {{thank me}} for sending them to Heaven, If they are wretched here.
