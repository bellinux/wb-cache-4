The relation between the following three quantities is examined: The affinity of the reaction driving the active transport, the ratio of isotope fluxes between identical solutions (“short-circuit”), and the maximal chemical potential difference which the active transport system can maintain. The interdependence of isotopeinteraction {{and the degree of}} coupling between transport and chemical reaction is shown explicitly: when the transport and chemical reaction are completely coupled, there is marked isotope interaction. In general, the logarithm of the <b>short-circuit</b> flux <b>ratio</b> (multiplied by RT) and the maximal chemical potential are not equal.

40|$|Power {{transformers}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} expensive and vital components in the power system. A sudden failure could be a very costly process for both the transformer owner and the society. Several monitoring and diagnostic techniques have been developed over the last decades to detect incipient transformer problems at an early stage, so that planned outages for maintenance and reparation can be carried out in time. However, the majority of these methods are only secondary indicators which do not address the transformers fundamental function: to transfer electric energy between different voltage levels with turn <b>ratio,</b> <b>short-circuit</b> impedance and power loss within acceptable limits. Transformer Explorer is a concept developed by ABB which utilizes ordinary current and voltage signals available in the substation to extract transformer fundamental parameters such as: turn ratio, magnetizing current, impedance and power loss, which has significant diagnostic value.

40|$|The {{demand on}} {{reducing}} circuit breaker failure, extending service life, increasing equipment reliability and lowering the related operating and maintenance costs are nowadays of prime {{importance for the}} electricity supply network. According to statistics, the major failure mode is originated from operating mechanism, whereas interrupter has {{the highest percentage of}} failure in high voltage component. Thus, the method to facilitate the assessment of internal mechanical conditions by using commercially available devices without opening major parts and the experimental investigation on electrical erosion inside the interrupter were performed in this work. The experimental investigation on the mechanical endurance of operating mechanism up to 6, 000 no-load switching was performed with 110 kV puffer type circuit breakers due to its requirement of large driving energy for hydraulic operating mechanism. The conventional measurement, e. g. coil current, contact timing, dynamic contact resistance and pumping motor current as well as additional vibration technique were carried out in both laboratory and field test. The investigation on electrical erosion focusing on aging of nozzle and electrode under current interruption was performed with a reduced-size SF 6 self-blast circuit breaker model and synthetic test circuit, providing the current density comparable to that in the real circuit breaker, because of the extensive use of nozzle ablation, the possibility for parameters variation and the reduction of cost and time. For mechanical investigation, the parameters were measured at the beginning as a reference and also thereafter every 500 switching under normal and variable operating conditions, e. g. variation of auxiliary supply voltage, hydraulic oil pressure and SF 6 gas pressure. The test result was verified by that from two of the same type circuit breakers and the theoretical calculation for vibration result in the frequency-domain analysis. Subsequently, the on-site measurement before and after maintenance and some simulated defects were executed. The electrical aging investigation was performed by successive tests with constant energy stresses until interrupting failure occurred. The effect of current amplitude, nozzle diameter, expansion volume, arcing time and recovery voltage on mass losses, geometry changes of nozzle and its influence on pressure build-up were investigated. The analysis of vibration signals in a combination with the other supervised parameters provides the useful information regarding the significant events occurring inside during circuit breaker operation, e. g. motion start of mechanism and within pole, contact touching and motion stop. The deviations of these measured values from the reference according to number of no-load switching operations, variable operating conditions and some incorporated defects were comprehensively determined. The relationship between the gradual changes in technical status of the supervised components and the number of no-load operations is helpful for selecting the proper maintenance method. Regarding the electrical erosion of the nozzle and the electrodes, the mass losses per switching and per energy; and the geometry change of nozzle especially between the arcing column and the expansion chamber were investigated. Moreover, volume loss and mass loss along the nozzle column; its effect on the pressure build-up reduction; and the dependences of mass losses on interrupting current amplitude, charge and generated heat have been determined. Furthermore by applying the wear equivalent law, the allowable number of interruption in function of the breaking current to rated <b>short-circuit</b> current <b>ratio</b> and the remaining lifetime can be determined. This result will be used to verify the accuracy of simulation tools in order to visualize the aging process, to evaluate the interrupter condition and to minimize the expensive experiment tests...|$|R

However, when the widely used MESCR was adopted to evaluate the stability margin of the Eastern China Grid including three infeed ultra-high-voltage DC (UHVDC) and five high-voltage DC transmission lines in 2016, the MESCR result indicated the system was strong enough but in fact occasionally collapses after the N- 1 contingency. To determine {{the reason for this}} conflict, this paper theoretically analyzes the limitations of the existing MESCR. The theoretical analysis reveals that when a large amount of capacitor compensations are concentratively installed in the system, the conventional MESCR {{will not be able to}} reflect the capacitor compensations’ influence on the system stability, and no matter how many capacitors are installed or where the capacitors are installed, the MESCR almost retains the same value; namely, the MESCR is saturated in such systems.

30|$|Modern power systems, {{employing}} {{an increasing}} number of converter-based renewable energy sources (RES) and decreasing the usage of conventional power plants, are leading to lower levels of short-circuit power and rotational inertia. A solution to this is the employment of synchronous condensers in the grid, in order to provide sufficient short-circuit power. This results in the increase of the <b>short-circuit</b> <b>ratio</b> (SCR) at transmission system bus-bars serving as points of interconnection (POI) to renewable generation. Evaluation of the required capacity and grid-location of the synchronous condensers, is inherently a mixed integer nonlinear optimization problem, which could not be done on manual basis considering each type of machine and all bus-bars.

40|$|A {{traditional}} {{method to}} achieve improved power quality (PQ) {{is to use}} passive filters connected at the sensitive load terminals. However, this practice has some shortcomings: {{the effectiveness of the}} scheme could deteriorate as the source impedance or load condition changes; it can lead to resonance between the filter and the source impedance. In this paper the use of series compensators (SCs) in improving voltage quality of isolated power systems is considered. The roles of the compensators are to mitigate the effects of momentary voltage sags/swells and to control the level of harmonic distortions in the networks. SC injects harmonic currents of the same magnitude but of opposite polarity to cancel the harmonics present there. A control strategy for the SC is developed to regulate power flow. This is achieved through phase adjustment of load terminal voltage. It leads to an increase in the ride through capability of loads to the voltage sags/swells. The isolated power systems are often considered weak in that they possess relatively lower <b>short-circuit</b> <b>ratio,</b> in comparison to a grid. Network voltage control becomes a challenging task as a result. The power quality problem is compounded with the drive-converter load. The sensitive loads would be connected in parallel with the nonlinear drive. Often such sensitive loads also contain input rectifiers that are capacitive in nature. The total capacity of the sensitive loads could be much smaller than that of the main drives; the distorted supply voltage is harmful to the sensitive loads.

30|$|LCL-filter-based {{grid-connected}} inverters {{have been}} widely discussed in [1, 2, 3, 4]. One of the important issues is their stability. Ref. [5] proposed a robust passive damping method for LLCL-filter-based grid-connected inverters, so as to minimize the effect of harmonic voltages on the grid. Another interesting filter was proposed in [6] for optimizing the system performance and stability. A recent review of passive filters for grid-connected converters was presented in [7], and different passive damping methods were discussed. In {{order to avoid the}} losses resulting from passive damping, capacitor-current feedback active damping was proposed in [8] to enhance the stability of LCL-type grid-connected inverters. Ref. [9] presented an interesting active damping method that can handle stability with only grid-current feedback control. In [10], a virtual RC damping method was presented with extended selective harmonic compensation. Note that these solutions are for voltage-source inverters. In practice, there are also current-source inverters [11, 12, 13]. An interesting active damping solution was presented in [14]. However, while the above methods are insightful for stability analysis, the impact of phase-locked loop (PLL) dynamics on the stability of grid-connected inverters has been neglected. The PLL is used to track the phase angle of the voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC) and thus to achieve grid synchronization for the inverter [15]. In case of high grid impedance, it has been found that the stability of a voltage source converter (VSC) can be affected by PLL parameters [16, 17]. In VSC-based high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission systems, the PLL parameters have been found to limit the maximum power transfer capability [18]. In [19], the impact of <b>short-circuit</b> <b>ratio</b> and phase-locked-loop parameters on small-signal behavior is investigated, However, it only takes L-filter-based inverters into account.|$|E
40|$|For {{high-voltage}} direct-current (HVDC) transmission, {{the strength}} of the ac system is important for normal operation. An ac system can be considered as weak either because its impedance is high or its inertia is low. A typical high-impedance systemis when an HVDC link is terminated at a weak point of a large ac system where the short-circuit capacity of the ac system is low. Low-inertia systems are considered to have limited number of rotating machines, or no machines at all. Examples of such applications can be found when an HVDC link is powering an isand system, or if it is connected to a wind farm. One of the advantages of applying a voltage-source converter (VSC) based HVDC systemis its potential to be connected to very weak ac systems where the conventional linecommutated converter (LCC) based HVDC system has difficulties. In this thesis, the modeling and control issues for VSC-HVDC links connected to weak ac systems are investigated. In order to fully utilize the potential of the VSC-HVDC system for weak-ac-system connections, a novel control method, i. e., powersynchronization control, is proposed. By using power-synchronization control, the VSC resembles the dynamic behavior of a synchronous machine. Several additional functions, such as high-pass current control, current limitation, etc. are proposed to deal with  issues during operation. For modeling of ac/dc systems, the Jacobian transfer matrix is proposed as a unified modeling approach. With the ac Jacobian transfer matrix concept, a synchronous ac system is viewed upon as one multivariable feedback system. In the thesis, it is shown that the transmission zeros and poles of the Jacobian transfer matrix are closely related to several power-system stability phenomena. The similar modeling concept is extended to model a dc system with multiple VSCs. It is mathematically proven that the dc system is an inherently unstable process, which requires feedback controllers to be stabilized. For VSC-HVDC links using power-synchronization control, the <b>short-circuit</b> <b>ratio</b> (SCR) of the ac system is no longer a limiting factor, but rather the load angles. The righthalf plane (RHP) transmission zero of the ac Jacobian transfer matrix moves closer to the origin with larger load angles, which imposes a fundamental limitation on the achievable bandwidth of the VSC. As an example, it is shown that a VSC-HVDC link using powersynchronization control enables a power transmission of 0. 86 p. u. from a system with an SCR of 1. 2 to a system with an SCR of 1. 0. For low-inertia systemconnections, simulation studies show that power-synchronization control is flexible for various operation modes related to island operation and handles the mode shifts seamlessly.
