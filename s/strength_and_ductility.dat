5|$|Tantalum is {{also used}} to produce a variety of alloys that have high melting points, <b>strength,</b> <b>and</b> <b>ductility.</b> Alloyed with other metals, it {{is also used}} in making carbide tools for {{metalworking}} equipment and in the production of superalloys for jet engine components, chemical process equipment, nuclear reactors, and missile parts. Because of its ductility, tantalum can be drawn into fine wires or filaments, which are used for evaporating metals such as aluminium. Since it resists attack by body fluids and is nonirritating, tantalum is widely used in making surgical instruments and implants. For example, porous tantalum coatings are used in the construction of orthopedic implants due to tantalum's ability to form a direct bond to hard tissue.|$|E

2500|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} (RC) is {{a composite}} material in which concrete's relatively low tensile <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> <b>ductility</b> are counteracted by the inclusion of reinforcement having higher tensile strength or ductility. The reinforcement is usually, though not necessarily, steel reinforcing bars (rebar) and is usually embedded passively in the concrete before the concrete sets. Reinforcing schemes are generally designed to resist tensile stresses in particular regions of the concrete that might cause unacceptable cracking and/or structural failure. Modern reinforced concrete can contain varied reinforcing materials made of steel, polymers or alternate composite material in conjunction with rebar or not. [...] Reinforced concrete may also be permanently stressed (in tension), so as to improve the behaviour of the final structure under working loads. In the United States, the most common methods of doing this are known as pre-tensioning and post-tensioning.|$|E

50|$|If KsL/EI ≥ 20, it is {{acceptable}} to consider the connection to be fully restrained (in other words, able to maintain the angles between members). If KsL/EI ≤ 2, it {{is acceptable}} to consider the connection to be simple (in other words, it rotates without developing moment). Connections with stiffnesses between these two limits are partially restrained and the stiffness, <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> <b>ductility</b> of the connection {{must be considered in}} the design.|$|E
50|$|If {{steel is}} exposed to {{hydrogen}} at high temperatures, hydrogen will diffuse into the alloy and combine with carbon to form tiny pockets of methane at internal surfaces like grain boundaries and voids. This methane does not diffuse out of the metal, and collects in the voids at high pressure and initiates cracks in the steel. This selective leaching process is known as hydrogen attack, or high temperature hydrogen attack and leads to decarburization of the steel and loss of <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> <b>ductility.</b>|$|E
