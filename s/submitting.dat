5|$|One {{probable}} {{reason for}} the British clergy's refusal {{to cooperate with the}} Gregorian missionaries was the ongoing conflict between the natives and the Anglo-Saxons, who still were encroaching upon British lands {{at the time of the}} mission. The British were unwilling to preach to the invaders of their country, and the invaders saw the natives as second-class citizens, and would have been unwilling to listen to any conversion efforts. There was also a political dimension, as the missionaries could be seen as agents of the invaders; because Augustine was protected by Æthelberht, <b>submitting</b> to Augustine would have been seen as <b>submitting</b> to Æthelberht's authority, which the British bishops would have been unwilling to do.|$|E

5|$|Others are obscure {{because of}} the damnatio memoriae {{surrounding}} the lives of antipopes, or because they were refused burial due to excommunication. Some of those can be presumed to have been buried unceremoniously in the monasteries to which the antipopes were confined after <b>submitting</b> or losing power. The exception is Hippolytus of Rome, the first antipope, who was translated to Rome by his former rival Pope Fabian following his martyrdom, and {{is regarded as a}} saint.|$|E

5|$|Retiring {{from the}} {{military}} in December 1963, Shoup {{took a job at}} a life insurance company, but remained influential in the administration.

5|$|After Mao Zedong purged Peng in 1959, Mao {{appointed}} Marshal He Long to {{the head}} of an office to investigate Peng's past in order to find additional reasons to criticize Peng.

Mao's prestige weakened when it became widely known that Mao's Great Leap Forward had been a disaster, and He eventually presented a report that was positive, and which attempted to vindicate Peng.|$|E
