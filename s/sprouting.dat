5|$|One {{mechanism}} {{involved in}} recovery is nerve terminal <b>sprouting,</b> in which remaining brainstem and spinal cord motor neurons develop new branches, or axonal sprouts. These sprouts can reinnervate orphaned muscle fibers {{that have been}} denervated by acute polio infection, restoring the fibers' capacity to contract and improving strength. Terminal <b>sprouting</b> may generate a few significantly enlarged motor neurons doing work previously performed {{by as many as}} four or five units: a single motor neuron that once controlled 200 muscle cells might control 800 to 1000 cells. Other mechanisms that occur during the rehabilitation phase, and contribute to muscle strength restoration, include myofiber hypertrophy—enlargement of muscle fibers through exercise and activity—and transformation of type II muscle fibers to type I muscle fibers.|$|E

40|$|Application. A partial {{overstory}} did {{not influence}} {{the number of}} stumps that <b>sprouted</b> {{or the number of}} <b>sprouts</b> per clump. <b>Sprout</b> clump survival and growth of dominant <b>sprouts</b> can be maximized under heavy partial cuttings. Additional overstory removal or <b>sprout</b> clump thinning may be necessary to maintain vigor of stump <b>sprouts</b> beneath partial overstories. Abstract. A 28 -year-old water oak (Quercus nigra L.) plantation was thinned from below to either 254 or 462 stems per hectare to determine the influence of a partial canopy on oak stump <b>sprout</b> development. <b>Sprout</b> clump survival, number of living <b>sprouts</b> in a clump, and height and DBH of the dominant <b>sprout</b> in a clump were measured in years l- 5 and 7 after harvest. By year 7, <b>sprout</b> clump survival under the heavily thinned canopy was 23 % higher than under the lightly thinned canopy. Within-clump <b>sprout</b> mortality was not influenced by overstory thinning level, but by year 2 height and diameter increment were 15 % and 22 % greater, respectively, under the heavy overstory removal. Positive height and diameter growth of dominant <b>sprouts</b> continued under both canopy conditions through year 7, but early benefits of the heavy overstory removal on <b>sprout</b> growth diminished. Additional overstory removal or <b>sprout</b> clump thinning would be necessary to sustain <b>sprout</b> clump survival and <b>sprout</b> growth over extended periods...|$|R

5|$|Banksia violacea {{is rarely}} cultivated. It is a slow-growing plant {{that tends to}} become untidy with age, and {{generally}} does not flower until {{four to five years}} after <b>sprouting</b> from seed. Flowers are an unusual colour, but occur within the bush where they grow within and are usually obscured by foliage. It tolerates light pruning not below the green foliage, except for the variant with a lignotuber, which may be pruned heavily. George recommends a sunny position in light, sandy soil. Professor Margaret Bernard Sedgley of the Waite Institute suggests the species is of no value to floriculture, as the inflorescences are too small and obscured by the foliage, although she does add that the purple colour may be a worthwhile character to select for in plant breeding. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 19 to 50 days to germinate.|$|E
40|$|Use {{of mature}} lupin seeds for human {{nutrition}} has been prevalent since ancient times.

However, no information is available about value-added products from lupin, especially white lupin (Lupinus albus L.), for human consumption. We prepared <b>sprouts</b> from seed of eight white lupin genotypes, grown at two locations in Virginia during 2003 - 04 crop season. These <b>sprouts</b> were analyzed for various traits. Location effects were significantly for all traits except for moisture content of <b>sprouts</b> whereas genotypic effects were significant only for fresh <b>sprout</b> yield.

These changes generally result in new flowers <b>sprouting</b> for the player to interact with. Flying through each flower results in a musical chime that harmonizes with the music. The music itself dynamically adjusts as changes are made to the world. The more flower petals the player has trailing the lead petal, the faster the petals move.

5|$|The radish (Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus) is an {{edible root}} {{vegetable}} of the Brassicaceae family that was domesticated in Europe in pre-Roman times. Radishes are grown and consumed throughout the world, being mostly eaten raw as a crunchy salad vegetable. They have numerous varieties, varying in size, flavor, color, {{and length of}} time they take to mature. Radishes owe their sharp flavor to the various chemical compounds produced by the plants, including glucosinolate, myrosinase, and isothiocyanate. They are sometimes grown as companion plants and suffer from few pests and diseases. They germinate quickly and grow rapidly, smaller varieties being ready for consumption within a month, while larger daikon varieties take several months. Another use of radish is as cover or catch crop in winter or as a forage crop. Some radishes are grown for their seeds; daikon, for instance, may be grown for oil production. Others are used for <b>sprouting.</b>|$|E

5|$|Theophrastus groups {{together}} the cereals and the legumes (peas and beans), and includes millet and other many-seeded plants like sesame also. These {{can only be}} grown from seed. They can be sown early, as with wheat, barley and beans, or in spring after the equinox, for plants like lentils, tares and peas. Vetch and chickpeas can, he reports, be sown at either season. When <b>sprouting,</b> beans form a shape like a penis, from which the root grows down and the leafy stem upwards. Wheat and barley flower {{for four or five}} days, whereas the legumes flower for much longer. Theophrastus reports that these plants grow differently according to the region, so for instance crops in Salamis appear earlier than those elsewhere in Attica. Wheat varieties are recorded as being named for their localities; they differ in colour, size, growth habit and food value. In a place near Bactra in Asia the wheat grains are said to grow as big as the stone of an olive, whereas pulses do not in Theophrastus's view vary to the same extent.|$|E
