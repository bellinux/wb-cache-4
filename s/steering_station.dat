50|$|November 27-December 1, 1905 : While sailing in Lake Huron with {{a load of}} coal for Duluth, MN a {{tremendous}} storm hit the region. The Holmes made it safely to the Soo Locks but she continued on, not knowing the full intensity of the storm. The Holmes was reported overdue on November 30, 1905. Although her identical sister ship, the Umbria, sustained heavy damage to her forward cabins and navigation centre (requiring the crew to steer the vessel from the emergency <b>steering</b> <b>station</b> at {{the stern of the}} vessel as it limped into Duluth), the Holmes arrived undamaged in Duluth, MN on December 1, sailing into the Duluth piers past the broken and battered wreck of the Pittsburgh Steamship Companies' SS Mataafa which had been wrecked trying to enter the piers. She had grounded and broken her back on the beach just a few yards from the shore. Nine crew-members of the Mataafa perished in the wreck, giving history the name Mataafa Storm.|$|E

5000|$|The first LCT Mark 1 was {{launched}} by Hawthorn Leslie in November 1940. It was an all-welded 372-ton steel-hulled vessel that drew only 3 ft {{of water at}} the bow. A 12 ft wide hinged ramp enabled tanks to exit directly onto the beaches, while a second steel door behind the ramp sealed the bow area from the tank deck. On both sides, watertight bulwark coamings contained storage compartments, which added to the buoyancy provided by the double bottom under the tank deck. Within the double bottom were ballast and fuel tanks, which allowed the fore and aft trim to be adjusted for beaching. At the rear was a small bridge, beneath which were two [...] Hall-Scott petrol engines, an auxiliary generator, batteries and pumps. The hull tanks contained enough fuel {{for a range of}} [...] Aft of the engine room were quarters for ten crewmen with galley and storage. Behind the bridge was a wardroom for two officers, and mounts for port and starboard 2-pounder pom-pom machine guns. Key to the LCT's operation was the large stern-mounted kedge anchor which was dropped while inbound to the beach. This anchor stopped the LCT from slewing or broaching, and, with its powerful winch, enabled the craft to pull itself off the beach once the cargo was unloaded. The bow ramp was initially raised and lowered by hand cranks, but in later versions a powered winch was installed. In each subsequent model, despite the size differences, the basic arrangement of power ramp, long tank well and aft <b>steering</b> <b>station</b> was retained.|$|E
