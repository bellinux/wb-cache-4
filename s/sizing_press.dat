40|$|The {{efficiency}} of optical brightening agents (OBAs), {{also known as}} fluorescent whitening agents (FWAs), has long been {{of interest in the}} production of uncoated fine paper, particularly in uncoated fine paper grades containing high-yield pulp (HYP). The increasing levels of whiteness and also the increasing HYP substitution in fine papers has made OBA efficiency an important issue. This paper summarizes recent research findings in understanding and enhancing OBA efficiency in fine papers containing HYP, with focus on the main factors affecting OBA efficiency in both wet end and <b>size</b> <b>press</b> application.

5000|$|Additional sizing agents, {{including}} resins, glue, or starch, can {{be added}} to the web to alter its characteristics. Sizing improves the paper's water resistance, decreases its ability to fuzz, reduces abrasiveness, and improves its printing properties and surface bond strength. These may be applied at the wet (internal sizing) or on the dry end (surface sizing), or both. At the dry end sizing is usually applied with a <b>size</b> <b>press.</b> The <b>size</b> <b>press</b> may be a roll applicator (flooded nip) or Nozzle applicator [...] It is usually placed before the last dryer section. Some paper machines also make use of a 'coater' to apply a coating of fillers such as calcium carbonate or china clay usually suspended in a binder of cooked starch and styrene-butadiene latex. Coating produces a very smooth, bright surface with the highest printing qualities.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{adaptive}} Helmholtz resonator for decreasing harmonic {{pulsating pressure}} in a low-pressure hydraulic system {{is presented in}} this study. Adaptivity is executed by both open loop and closed loop controls so that continuous - 20 dB attenuation of the peak-to-peak value of the amplitude of pressure is reached. The study begins by a theory review including the theory of effective bulk modulus, sound velocity measurements, adjustable dynamic vibration absorbers and control methods of dynamic vibration absorbers. The main target of the paper, the Helmholtz resonator, is presented in its own chapter, albeit it is noted to be one application of the dynamic vibration absorber. The review is completed by the analytical model of the hydraulic pipe with a T-filter or Helmholtz resonator. After the theory review, the test equipment and its characteristics are presented. The main parts of the test equipment were a main pipe and an adjustable Helmholtz resonator, which were both developed for this study. Certain properties of the hydraulic oils used were determined experimentally to increase understanding of the system. The experimental section includes sound velocity measurements, sonic bulk modulus definitions, measurements of the resonant frequencies of the adaptive Helmholtz resonator in the test equipment, and tests of the open loop and closed loop control of the resonator. Control is verified to maintain - 20 dB attenuating of pressure pulsations in the system. The presented Helmholtz resonator and controls are available for installation into a hydraulic system to damp out harmonic vibrations at low frequency. For example, the roll in the <b>size</b> <b>press</b> of a paper machine might become excited to vibrate at its resonance frequency after the paper wad has washed through the nip. In that case, tuned Helmholtz resonators in the hydraulic cylinders of the <b>size</b> <b>press</b> would damp out the pulsating pressures, and if the resonators are adaptive, as presented in this study, they can operate in a wider frequency range...|$|R

40|$|In this study, microfibrillated {{cellulose}} (MFC) {{was applied}} {{in an aqueous}} suspension as a coating material on paper substrates. Two different coating techniques were used: rod coating and <b>size</b> <b>press.</b> The MFC suspension used has a high water content and water is known to deteriorate {{the properties of the}} paper, so water treated paper substrates were prepared as references to give an indication of the effects that the processing has on the final properties of the coated papers. The structure of the MFC coating and associated surface properties were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and by measuring the thickness and the roughness of the coated substrates. A tool to visualise the distribution of the MFC was developed and the tensile properties ofthe MFC coated substrates were characterised. Resistance to air, oxygen and water vapour permeationas well as water and grease absorption were used to describe the barrier properties of the coated papers. The MFC coated paper substrates exhibited a higher roughness than the reference paper substrate. This was due to the sensitivity of the substrate to water and not from the coating material it self since the water treated paper substrates showed an even higher roughness than the MFC coated substrates. The latter showed slightly increased tensile properties compared to the reference paper substrates, and most importantly, reduced air permeance and grease absorption (- 100 % and - 84 % respectively); for the rod coated paper substrate with 3 g⁄m 2 coat weight. The water vapour transmission rate was also decreased with the applied MFC coatings. Advantages and drawbacks were identified for the coating techniques. The rod coating allowed a good control of the coat weight in a range of 1 to 3 g⁄m 2. However, the Mayer rod and the high viscosity of the MFC suspension caused poor MFC distribution and a coating which reproduced the rod pattern. With the <b>size</b> <b>press,</b> coat weights around 1 g⁄m 2 were reached.

40|$|Fluorescent {{whitening}} agents (FWAs) are {{the most}} widely used functional chemicals for the manufacture of printing and writing grades of paper.

In spite of the extensive use of FWAs, no method has been established to analyze the FWA content in process water and paper products. Samples are typically exposed to UV light in order to detect the presence of FWAs. This method is based on the fluorescence exhibited by FWAs under a UV-lamp. The observation of fluorescence with the naked eye is highly subjective. Thus, it is essential to develop a more scientific and objective to the quantitative analysis of FWA optical effects. Water and paper samples containing FWAs were prepared in a laboratory. Quantitative analysis was carried out with a spectrofluorometer, a spectrophotometer, and an image restoration microscope.

The sorption of two dyes was investigated to elucidate the adsorption mechanism.

40|$|The {{application}} of fillers {{at the surface}} of cellulosic paper is an interesting and industrially-commercialized but not very well-known concept, in which the filler particles are essentially added to the voids of the fibrous matrixes.

As an easily practicable process, surface filling has some advantages over direct wet-end addition of fillers, such as minimizing the adverse effects of filler addition on paper strength. Efficient surface filling is somewhat dependent on the specific characteristics of both fillers and fibrous matrixes. Surface filling may provide interesting possibilities for the papermaking discipline; for example, it would open the door to maximizing the cost-effectiveness of paper mills, and efficiently adding new functionalities to cellulosic paper. From both practical and fundamental points of view, systematic exploration and understanding of surface filling of cellulosic paper would be of great significance to the papermaking industry...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis was to gain a greater {{understanding}} of the interactions between the base paper and coating color in the metered <b>size</b> <b>press</b> (MSP) nip. The effect of base paper in precoating with an MSP was investigated using mill woodfree base papers, laboratory sheets, pilot base papers and non-porous materials. The coating color formulations consisted of commercial raw materials, in most cases latex-CMC colors with a pigment mixture of CaCO and kaolin. Coating studies were carried out at 1000 m/min with a pilot-scale MSP coater. The coating layer formation on woodfree base paper in MSP precoating depended mainly on the base paper surface openness. Lowering the base paper openness by raising the filler content, adding mechanical pulp or through more intensive refining of the chemical pulps resulted in lower coatweights, but better coating coverage. Base paper roughness, small-scale basis weight variation (beta formation) and surface chemical properties of the fibers (hydrophilic / hydrophobic) had no effect on precoating layer formation or coverage.

40|$|Global {{production}} of coated paper for printing is currently about 45 - 50 million tonnes annually, with a predicted {{growth rate of}} between 3 and 4 %. In order to remain competitive, coated paper producers have had to increase productivity and reduce cost. One way this has been achieved is through developments in technology which make the papermaking, coating and finishing operations much more efficient. Coated papers give much better printing quality than uncoated grades. The coating layer {{is made up of}} mineral particles (kaolin and calcium carbonate) with a latex binder, formulated above the cpvc so that the pores are filled with air.

It was observed that the whiteness and brightness of the pulp are highly correlated and that the control of the bleaching plant can be done by any one of these two parameters. It was also concluded that, considering current prices of bleaching reagents and of optical brighteners, it is better to bleach the pulp up to lower brightness values (e. g. 88 % ISO) and use larger amounts of optical brighteners to brighten the mass until the whiteness of 130 CIE.
