According to the duty roster Robert Paterson was not on duty either but in fact he was on duty – he was the one that fired a shot.|$|E

He settled in the New York City area, and made his debut appearance on the Opie and Anthony radio show on January 17, 2002, when friend and comedian Rich Vos brought him onto the show which at the time, aired from WNEW.

25|$|After {{having his}} cabaret card restored, Monk relaunched his New York career with a {{landmark}} six-month residency at the Five Spot Cafe in the East Village neighborhood of New York beginning in June 1957, leading a quartet with John Coltrane on tenor saxophone, Wilbur Ware on bass, and Shadow Wilson on drums. Little of this group's music was documented owing to contractual problems: Coltrane was signed to Prestige at the time, but Monk refused {{to return to}} his former label. One studio session by the quartet was made for Riverside, three tunes which were not released until 1961 by the subsidiary label Jazzland along with outtakes from a larger group recording with Coltrane and Hawkins, those results appearing in 1957 as the album Monk's Music. An amateur tape from the Five Spot (a later September 1958 reunion with Coltrane <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> Johnny Griffin) was issued on Blue Note in 1993; and a recording of the quartet performing at a Carnegie Hall concert on November 29 was recorded in high fidelity by Voice of America engineers, rediscovered {{in the collection of the}} Library of Congress in 2005 and released by Blue Note.|$|E
