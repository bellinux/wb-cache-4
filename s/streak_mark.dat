40|$|Environmental {{pollution}} {{has become}} a concern of the architectural industry as it causes aesthetical effects to urban buildings. Thus, {{the development of a}} coating which contains self-cleaning behavior plays {{a crucial role in the}} achievement of more competitive architectural coatings and to curb the cost of high maintenance. This preliminary study wish to test the effectiveness of Nano TiO 2 as an additive prior more developments and formulations can be done. Due to the ability to accelerate degradation of many organic contaminants, nanometric titanium dioxide (TiO 2) has been selected as the promising photocatalytic material. Nano TiO 2 were pre-synthesized in dispersed form before it is incorporated into the acryllic based coating system, the existing formula of exterior paint Nippon Weatherbond colour bases i. e. Pastel Base and Deep Base. The nanometric size of nano TiO 2 were experimentally examined by using SEM and the optimal dosage of the nano TiO 2 in the coating will be determined from the experiments. Physical properties such as opacity, whiteness and colour were determined by using the right tools. A series of coating properties tests e. g. application test, harsh weather resistance test, UV irradiation resistance, dirt pick-up test and etc were carried out to study the properties of self-cleaning coating in terms of wet paint and dry paint film. Paint film surface morphology such as hydrophilicity and contact angle were being studied as well. The results shown that coatings with NanoTiO 2 additive with 3 % dosage is able to perform better in terms of self-cleaning, which can be significantly observed through Dirt Pick Up Resistance Test, Dirt <b>Streak</b> <b>Mark</b> Test, photocatalytic effectiveness, contact angle measurement and etc...|$|E

Injury problems worsened, as by the end of October starting guards Sanders and Greg Roberts were both on injured reserve. League rules allowed teams to activate a maximum of three players per season off of injured reserve, but the Buccaneers had already activated two and intended to save the third for Mike Rae in case of an injury to a quarterback. Although the staff would not publicize players' personal problems, it was later revealed that several players experienced diminished performance due to excessive drug use.
