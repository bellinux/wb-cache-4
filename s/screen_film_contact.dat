40|$|AbstractBackgroundMammography is a {{radiological}} {{diagnostic method}} which relies on an X-ray examination of breasts {{and is a}} process involving the use of low-dose amplitude-X-rays (usually around 0. 7 mSv). Combining the use of small doses and high quality images requires extensive quality protocols, part of them being included in regulations adopted by the Minister of Health. AimThe {{aim of this study}} was to check the usefulness and efficacy of selected quality tests associated with mammography. Material/methodsThe study was performed in the mammography service of the Greater Poland Cancer Centre in Poznan. Following equipment was used: densitometer, sensitometer, mammographic scales, electronic scales, thermometer, hygrometer, PMMA plates, Europhantom, <b>screen</b> <b>film</b> <b>contact</b> phantom, viewing boxes and magnifying glasses. The methods were based on basic mammography tests. Quality control in mammography demands: clean darkroom, marked and clean cassettes, clean viewing boxes with homogenous light. ResultsThe results of the “Development Process” test show that each sensitometer has to be used with an appropriate densitometer. Phantoms with abnormal structures cannot be used to “AEC System – Solidity exposure” test. “Compression – The force of compression” test may only be carried out with suitable scales and compressible material. Analysis of rejected films shows that the main reasons for rejection were wrong collimation and underexposure. ConclusionEvery quality control in mammography provides essential information about the functioning of a laboratory. Apart from recommended standard sterility, it should be remembered that equipment should always be adjusted and repaired...|$|E
40|$|The {{large scale}} {{production}} of silicon {{solar cell array}} panels is discussed. The cost and performance of three manufacturing sequences designed to convert silicon sheet and wafers into solar panels is analyzed. The production of ion implanted and furnace annealed solar cells made using solar grade n- and p-type wafers is examined. The performance of production size lots is examined {{with regard to the}} relationship between the ion implant and furnace anneal parameters and the ability to form consistently good thick <b>film</b> <b>screen</b> printed <b>contacts.</b> The spray on antireflection coating process is evaluated. The performance of several lots of cells before and after coating is measured. The structure and refractive index of the RCA I (TiO 2) coating is compared with commercial solutions. Sensitivity of coated, screen printed cells to the post heat treatment required to cure the films is assessed...|$|R
