25|$|Following the {{extended}} usage of pallet-wide containers in Europe the EU started the Intermodal Loading Unit (ILU) initiative. This showed advantages for intermodal transport of containers and <b>swap</b> <b>bodies.</b> This {{led to the}} introduction of ILU-Codes defined by the standard EN 13044 which has the same format as the earlier BIC-Codes. The International Container Office BIC agreed to only issue ownership codes ending with U, J or Z. The new allocation office of the UIRR (International Union of Combined Road-Rail Transport Companies) agreed to only issue ownership reporting marks for <b>swap</b> <b>bodies</b> ending with A, B, C, D or K – companies having a BIC-Code ending with U can allocate an ILU-Code ending with K having the same preceding letters. Since July 2011 the new ILU codes can be registered, beginning with July 2014 all intermodal ISO containers and intermodal <b>swap</b> <b>bodies</b> must have an ownership code and by July 2019 all of them must bear a standard-conforming placard.|$|E

(In other words, {{the actor who}} starts playing Mal later plays Jill in Mal's body, and vice versa.) This {{is in contrast to}} Body Language where the two actresses continued playing themselves in new bodies.|$|E
25|$|The {{widespread}} use of ISO standard containers has driven modifications in other freight-moving standards, gradually forcing removable truck bodies or <b>swap</b> <b>bodies</b> into standard sizes and shapes (though without the strength needed to be stacked), and changing completely the worldwide use of freight pallets that fit into ISO containers or into commercial vehicles.|$|E

25|$|This {{play was}} one of several {{attempts}} Alan Ayckbourn made to write a play involving swapping bodies. In 1990, Body Language was premiered, where a fat woman and a thin woman <b>swap</b> <b>bodies</b> from the neck down following a botched operation. And in 2002's The Jollies, a young boy is transported into an adult's body whilst his mother is transported into a young girl's body.|$|E
25|$|Next, Welsh {{released}} The Acid House, {{a collection}} of short stories from Rebel Inc., New Writing Scotland and other sources. Many of the stories take place in and around the housing schemes from Trainspotting, and employ many of the same themes; a touch of fantasy is apparent in stories such as The Acid House, where the minds of a baby and a drug user <b>swap</b> <b>bodies,</b> or The Granton Star Cause, where God transforms a man into a fly as punishment for wasting his life. Welsh adapted three of the stories for a later film of the same name, in which he also appeared.|$|E
