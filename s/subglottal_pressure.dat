40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} entrained oscillations of {{the right and left}} vocal folds in the presence of asymmetries. A simple one-mass model is proposed for each vocal fold. A stiffness asymmetry and open glottis oscillations are considered first, and regions of oscillation are determined by a stability analysis and an averaging technique. The results show that the <b>subglottal</b> threshold <b>pressure</b> for 1 : 1 entrainment increases with the asymmetry. Within that region, both folds oscillate with the same amplitude and with the lax fold delayed in time with regard to the tense fold. At large asymmetries, a region involving several different phase entrainments or toroidal regimes at constant threshold pressure appears. The effect of vocal fold collisions and asymmetry in the damping coefficients of the oscillators are explored next by means of numerical analyses. It is shown that the damping asymmetry expands the 1 : 1 entrainment region at low <b>subglottal</b> <b>pressures</b> across the whole asymmetry range. In the expanded region, the oscillator with the lowest natural frequency is dominant and the other oscillator has a large phase advance and small amplitude. The theoretical results are finally compared with data collected from a mechanical replica of the vocal folds. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

A theoretical model was first proposed to incorporate vocal fold elongation into the two-mass model. This model predicted the direct and nondirect components of the glottal time series {{as a function of}} vocal fold elongation. Furthermore, high-speed digital imaging was applied in excised larynx experiments to visualize vocal fold vibrations with variable vocal fold elongation from - 10 % to 50 % and <b>subglottal</b> <b>pressures</b> of 18 - and 24 -cm H(2) O. Comparison between theoretical model simulations and experimental observations showed good agreement. A relative maximum was seen in the nondirect component of glottal area, suggesting that an optimal elongation could maximize the vocal fold vibratory power. However, sufficiently large vocal fold elongations caused the nondirect component to approach zero and the direct component to approach a constant. These results showed that vocal fold elongation {{plays an important role in}} governing the dynamics of glottal area movement and validated the applicability of the proposed theoretical model and high-speed imaging to investigate laryngeal activity...|$|R

40|$|Frequency jumps are {{a common}} {{phenomenon}} in voice production. They are perceived as dis-continuities in voice pitch caused by smooth changes of physiological parameters, and may be observed in transitions between chest and falsetto vocal registers. Here, a recent model of birdsong production is used to model an oscillator source for the vocal folds coupled to an acoustic waveguide for the vocal tract, {{in terms of a}} delay differential equation. Numerical integration of the equation shows regions of coexistence of periodic solutions when the source-tract coupling is strong enough and the fundamental frequency is close to a resonance of the vocal tract. The coupling increases at larger <b>subglottal</b> <b>pressures</b> and smaller cross-sectional area of the vocal tract. The results reproduce patterns of chest-falsetto transitions, as well as voice instabilities observed when singing into a tube with increasing pitch. Further, they match data obtained from a mechanical replica of the vocal folds attached to a wave-guide of varying length. In general, these findings depart from the standard source-filter model of voice production, which regards the vocal tract as a mere filter to the glottal sound. The separation between the vocal source and tract holds as a valid approximation at low fre-quencies. However, source-tract interactions become relevant at higher frequencies, such as in cases of the singing voice and some animal vocalizations.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine the acoustic, aerodynamic, physiologic, and perceptual {{characteristics}} of modal and vocal fry production. Twenty normal speakers (10 males, 10 females) participated in the study. Speech material included four sustained vowels (/i/, /a/, /ae/, /u/), and syllable strings of/pi/repetitions produced in both modal and vocal fry registers. Acoustic data (fundamental frequency, jitter, shimmer, and signal- to-noise ratio), aerodynamic data (airflow and air pressure), and electroglottographic (EGG) data were obtained simultaneously. Results demonstrated considerable differences across voice parameters for the modal and vocal fry registers. Fundamental frequency was significantly lower in vocal fry than in modal register for both males and females, however, significant gender differences existed only in modal register. For both males and females, measurements of jitter and shimmer were significantly higher and signal to noise ratio was significantly lower in vocal fry. In addition, airflow rate in modal register was almost three times as high as the airflow rate in vocal fry register during sustained vowel production. During syllable string production, <b>subglottal</b> air <b>pressure</b> values in modal register were approximately 1. 5 times higher than that in the vocal fry register. In general, these data emphasize that the aeromechanical mechanisms of vocal fold vibratory behavior are substantially different between modal and vocal fry registers.

40|$|International audienceDuring inhaled therapies for the {{treatment}} of pulmonary diseases, upper airways (UA) anatomic arrangement can act as an unwanted filter, which limits the amount of drug delivered to the lungs. The minimal UA constriction is defined by the vocal folds aperture within the larynx, called the glottis. This anatomical singularity yields to a complex jet-like tracheal flow, which can be determinant on particle transport and deposition by inertial impaction. The present study aims to characterize the glottal dynamics during in vivo human breathing, and to predict the effect of a realistic mobile glottis on the aerosol filtering in the larynx using CFD modeling. Firstly, the glottal dynamics during eupnea, tachypnea and hyperpnea breathing were investigated using synchronized video recording of laryngofibroscopic examination and oral airflow measurements. Direct measurement of <b>subglottal</b> air <b>pressure</b> was also performed to determine transglottal pressure drop changes. Glottal geometrical variations were then deduced from an image processing analysis and used to develop a 3 D dynamic model of the glottal aperture. Finally, numerical two-phase flow simulations were conducted using experimental unsteady airflow conditions, for both motionless and realistic glottal configurations. The results of the experimental measures show that the glottal geometry observed during a breathing cycle can be extremely variable depending on the respiratory phase, volume magnitude and frequency. Inter-subject variability of the identified glottal motions is also established. The CFD simulations demonstrate that the glottal geometry variations strongly influence the laryngeal jet dynamics, transglottal pressure drop and aerosol deposition within the laryngeal area...|$|R

The aim of the present thesis is to present quantitative data of normal vocal function using a noninvasive method. Measurements are made on the inverse filtered airflow waveform, of estimated average trans glottal pressure and glottal airflow, and of sound pressure for productions of syllable sequences. Statistical results are used to infer mechanisms that underlie differences across (1) normal, loud, and soft voice, (2) normal, high, and low pitch, and (3) between female and male voices. Interspeaker variation in group data and intra speaker variation across repeated recordings is also investigated. The results showed no significant female-male differences in pressure, suggesting that differences in other measures were not primarily {{due to differences in}} the respiratory systems. Most glottal waveforms showed a DC flow offset, suggesting an air leakage through a posterior glottal opening. Results suggested (indirectly) that the males in comparison with the females had significantly higher vocal fold closing velocities (maximum flow declination rate), larger vocal fold oscillations (AC flow), and relatively longer closed portions of the cycle (open quotient) in normal and loud voice. In soft voice, female and male waveforms were more alike. In comparison with normal voice, both females and males produced loud voice with significantly higher values of pressure, vocal fold closing velocity, and AC flow. Soft voice was produced with significantly lower values of these measures and increased DC flow. Correlation analyses indicated that several of the airflow measures were more directly related to vocal intensity than to pitch. Interspeaker variation was large, emphasizing the importance of large subject groups to capture normal variation. Intraspeaker variation across recording sessions was less than 2 standard deviations of the group means. The results should contribute to the understanding of normal voice function, and should be useful as norms in studies of voices disorders as well. Härtill 5 uppsatser.

50|$|Infants {{produce a}} variety of vowel- and consonant-like sounds that they combine into {{increasingly}} longer sequences. The production of vowel sounds (already in the first 2 months) precedes the production of consonants, with the first back consonants (e.g., g, k) being produced around 2-3 months, and front consonants (e.g., m, n, p) starting to appear around 6 months of age. As for pitch contours in early infant utterances, infants between 3 and 9 months of age produce primarily flat, falling and rising-falling contours.

It is the properties of tension and elasticity that allow the vocal folds to be stretched, bunched, brought together and separated. During prephonation, the vocal folds move from the abducted to adducted position. <b>Subglottal</b> <b>pressure</b> builds and air flow forces the folds apart, inferiorly to superiorly. If the volume of airflow is constant, the velocity of the flow will increase at the area of constriction and cause a decrease in pressure below once distributed.

50|$|A {{situation}} {{can be considered}} where (1) the vocal fold valve is closed separating the supraglottal cavity from the subglottal cavity, (2) the mouth is open and, therefore, supraglottal air pressure is equal to atmospheric pressure, and (3) the lungs are contracted resulting in a <b>subglottal</b> <b>pressure</b> that has increased to a pressure that is greater than atmospheric pressure. If the vocal fold valve is subsequently opened, the previously two separate cavities become one unified cavity although the cavities will still be aerodynamically isolated because the glottic valve between them is relatively small and constrictive. Pascal's Law states that the pressure within a system must be equal throughout the system. When the <b>subglottal</b> <b>pressure</b> is greater than supraglottal pressure, there is a pressure inequality in the unified cavity. Since pressure is a force applied to a surface area by definition and a force {{is the product of}} mass and acceleration according to Newton's Second Law of Motion, the pressure inequality will be resolved by having part of the mass in air molecules found in the subglottal cavity move to the supraglottal cavity. This movement of mass is airflow. The airflow will continue until a pressure equilibrium is reached. Similarly, in an ejective consonant with a glottalic airstream mechanism, the lips or the tongue (i.e., the buccal or lingual valve) are initially closed and the closed glottis (the laryngeal piston) is raised decreasing the oral cavity volume behind the valve closure and increasing the pressure compared to the volume and pressure at a resting state. When the closed valve is opened, airflow will result from the cavity behind the initial closure outward until intraoral pressure is equal to atmospheric pressure. That is, air will flow from a cavity of higher pressure to a cavity of lower pressure until the equilibrium point; the pressure as potential energy is, thus, converted into airflow as kinetic energy.|$|E

Their vocal and respiratory system is not well understood but appears to consist of a combination of features that are also found in the extremely vocal avian and mammalian taxa. Anatomical studies suggest that the alligator larynx is able to abduct and adduct the vocal folds, but not to elongate or shorten them, and is therefore lacking a key regulator of frequency, yet alligators can modulate fundamental frequency remarkably well. We investigated the morphological and physiological features of sound production in alligators. Vocal fold length scales isometrically across a wide range of alligator body sizes. The relationship between fundamental frequency and <b>subglottal</b> <b>pressure</b> is significant in some individuals at some isolated points, such as call onset and position of maximum fundamental frequency. The relationship is not consistent over large segments of the call. Fundamental frequency can change faster than expected by pressure changes alone, suggesting an active motor pattern controls frequency and is intrinsic to the larynx. We utilized a two-mass vocal fold model to test whether abduction and adduction could generate this motor pattern. The fine-tuned interplay between <b>subglottal</b> <b>pressure</b> and glottal adduction can achieve frequency modulations much larger than those resulting from <b>subglottal</b> <b>pressure</b> variations alone and of similar magnitude, as observed in alligator calls.

A doubling of <b>subglottal</b> <b>pressure</b> yielded, on average, an SPL increase of 2. 3 dB. In another experiment, the associated vocal fold vibration patterns were recorded by digital high-speed imaging. Inverse filtering of the simultaneously recorded audio signal showed that the aperiodicity was caused by a low frequency modulation of the flow glottogram pulse amplitude. This modulation was produced by an aperiodic or periodic vibration of the supraglottic mucosa. This vibration reduced the pulse amplitude by obstructing the airway for some of the pulses produced by the periodically vibrating vocal folds. The supraglottic mucosa vibration can be assumed to be driven by the high airflow produced by the elevated <b>subglottal</b> <b>pressure...</b>|$|E
