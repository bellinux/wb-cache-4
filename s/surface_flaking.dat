40|$|Abstract. In {{the rolling}} bearing, the flaking caused by rolling contact fatigue is {{classified}} into two types: <b>surface</b> originated <b>flaking</b> and subsurface originated flaking. It {{has been recognized}} that marked microstructural change can occur in subsurface originated flaking due to rolling contact fatigue. But there are few reports in <b>surface</b> originated <b>flaking</b> about microstructural change. In this study, <b>surface</b> originated <b>flaking</b> caused by rolling contact fatigue was investigated based on microstructural change. Thrust ball bearing and radial ball bearing was used for fatigue test. Simulation of dent originated flaking was carried out using the bearing with artificial dent. Another fatigue test subjected to <b>surface</b> originated <b>flaking</b> was done under shortage of oil film thickness lubrication condition. Microstructural change was measured by X-ray Diffractmetry (XRD) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) during fatigue testing. Microstructure of bearing steel used for fatigue test is consisted of martensite with small amount of retained austenite. XRD measurement reveals that the half peak width of martensite and volume fraction of retained austenite decreasing with increasing testing time, {{and the amount of}} decrease in these parameter were small in the <b>surface</b> originated <b>flaking</b> compared with subsurface originated flaking when the specimens were flaking. This suggests that <b>surface</b> originated <b>flaking</b> occurs in spite of mild microstructural change. TEM observation about the <b>surface</b> originated <b>flaking</b> shows plastic flow in the surface layer. Especially, it was confirmed that partial recrystallization occurs in the fatigue test under shortage of oil film thickness lubrication condition. But it was also confirmed that degree of recrystallization is lower in the <b>surface</b> originated <b>flaking</b> than subsurface one, and this reasonably explains XRD result. From these results, it was cleared that recrystallizaiton of martensite is differ in degree but not in kind between <b>surface</b> originated <b>flaking</b> and subsurface originated flaking...|$|R

50|$|Burnishing is {{normally}} undesirable in mechanical components {{for a variety}} of reasons, sometimes simply because its effects are unpredictable. Even light burnishing will significantly alter the surface finish of a part. Initially the finish will be smoother, but with repetitive sliding action, grooves will develop on the surface along the sliding direction. The plastic deformation associated with burnishing will harden the surface and generate compressive residual stresses. Although these properties are usually advantageous, excessive burnishing leads to sub-surface cracks which cause spalling, a phenomenon where the upper layer of a <b>surface</b> <b>flakes</b> off of the bulk material.|$|R

Four months of outdoor weathering turned the color of RHPE CECap into silvery grey. When the exposure time increased, the color of RHPE composite faded faster than neat polyethylene.

40|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} (H 2 O 2) at a micromolar level {{played a}} role in the microbial surface oxidation of pyrite crystals under initially neutral pH. When the mineral-bacteria system was cyclically exposed to 50 μM H 2 O 2, the colonization of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans onto the mineral surface was markedly enhanced, as compared to the control(no added H 2 O 2). This can be attributed to the effects of H 2 O 2 on increasing the roughness of the mineral surfaces, as well as the acidity and Fe 2 + concentration at the mineral-solution interfaces. All of these effects tended to create more favourable nanoto micro-scale environments in the mineral surfaces for the cell adsorption. However, higher H 2 O 2 levels inhibited the attachment of cells onto the mineral surfaces, possibly due to the oxidative stress in the bacteria when they approached the mineral surfaces where high levels of free radicals are present as a result of Fenton-like reactions. The more aggressive nature of H 2 O 2 as an oxidant caused marked <b>surface</b> <b>flaking</b> of the mineral surface. The XPS results suggest that H 2 O 2 accelerated the oxidation of pyrite-S and consequently facilitated the overall corrosion cycle of pyrite surfaces. This was accompanied by pH drop in the solution in contact with the pyrite cubes. ...|$|E

50|$|A curious {{aspect of}} the ringing rock {{boulders}} {{in all of the}} boulder fields is the presence of odd weathering textures. Often the weathering textures take on the form of channels, grooves, 'potholes', 'mudcracks', and intense pitting. In some cases the textures are so distinctive that some geologists refer to them in terms of carbonate rock solution features (Sevon 1999). Inspection of the boulders reveals that the weathering patterns are not due to any internal variations in the rock, but have been superimposed onto the surfaces. The probable source of these textures was chemical weathering along joint surfaces {{at the time that the}} rock was still in place and before the boulders were broken out by frost heaving (Psilovikos 1982). The soft weathered portion of the outer <b>surfaces</b> <b>flaked</b> off once the boulders were exposed to the air. Small features on the boulder surfaces became exaggerated as the weathered material was removed, so that adjoining fissures became channels, dents became 'potholes', and old surfaces became intensely pitted.|$|R
40|$|The Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) Engineering and Research Staff in {{collaboration}} {{with members of the}} Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI), Tritium Engineering Laboratory have commenced in-situ tritium measurements of the TFTR bumper limiter. The Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR) operated with tritium from 1993 to 1997. During this time {approximately} 53, 000 Ci of tritium was injected into the TFTR vacuum vessel. After the cessation of TFTR plasma operations in April 1997 an aggressive tritium cleanup campaign lasting {approximately} 3 months was initiated. The TFTR vacuum vessel was subjected to a regimen of glow discharge cleaning (GDC) and dry nitrogen and ''moist air'' purges. Currently {approximately} 7, 500 Ci of tritium remains in the vacuum vessel largely contained in the limiter tiles. The TFTR limiter is composed of 1, 920 carbon tiles with an average weight of {approximately} 600 grams each. The location and distribution of tritium on the TFTR carbon tiles are of considerable interest. Future magnetically confined fusion devices employing carbon as a limiter material may be considerably constrained due to potentially large tritium inventories being tenaciously held {{on the surface of the}} tiles. In-situ tritium measurements were conducted in TFTR bay L during August and November 1998. During the bay L measurement campaign open wall ion chambers and ultra thin thermoluminscent dosimeters (TLD) affixed to a boom and end effector were deployed into the vacuum vessel. The detectors were designed to make contact with the surface of the bumper limiter tile and to provide either real time (ion chamber) or passive (TLD) indication of the surface tritium concentration. The open wall ion chambers were positioned onto the surface of the tile in a manner which employed the surface of the tile as one of the walls of the chamber. The ion chambers, which are (electrically) gamma insensitive, were landed at four positions per tile. The geometry for landing the TLD's provided measurement at 24 positions per tile. The instrumentation was positioned on the tiles (96 tiles in each bay) by technicians who manipulated the boom and end effector from outside the vacuum vessel port. In addition to obtaining bay L tile measurements, 3 bumper limiter tiles were collected from the vacuum vessel for further analysis. During the bay L measurement campaign it was observed that several of the tiles in the lower third of the bumper limiter exhibited considerable <b>surface</b> <b>flaking...</b>|$|E

40|$|Working load is {{one factor}} that affects wear on stone tools. Despite the {{recognition}} {{of the importance of the}} relationship between working load and the development of microwear on stone tools, there have been few attempts to quantify differences in wear due to changes in load. In a controlled experiment, we used 30 basalt flakes knapped from raw material collected in Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, Africa, to cut oak branches for the same number of strokes. For each flake, a different loading level was applied starting at 150 g and increasing by increments of 150 g to a maximum load of 4. 5 kg. A laser scanning confocal microscope was used to mathematically document the surface texture of the <b>flakes.</b> The worn <b>surface</b> data were compared using area-scale fractal complexity (Asfc), calculated from relative areas, to determine the degree to which variation in loading significantly affected the amount of wear on the <b>flake</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Our results indicate that working load does play a role in the development of lithic microwear on these flakes and that discrimination of two worn <b>flake</b> <b>surfaces,</b> using mean square ratios of Asfc, based on variable load is consistently possible with load differences between ~ 100 g and 4. 5 kg.

From the bridge upwards the rocks are all gneiss, alternating with chert and quartz. The Nunklow spur is covered with enormous rounded blocks of syenite, reposing on clay or on one another.
