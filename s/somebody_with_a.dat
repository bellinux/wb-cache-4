25|$|Gerry {{contacts}} Thierry, and the airliner is {{diverted to}} a World Health Organization (WHO) facility outside Cardiff, Wales. When a stowaway zombie attacks in mid-air, Gerry uses a grenade {{to blow the}} infected out of the aircraft, but this also causes them to crash. Gerry is injured, but both he and Segen survive. They proceed to the WHO facility, where Gerry loses consciousness. He awakens three days later and explains to the remaining WHO staff a theory he has, based on the people he has seen the zombies ignore: the infected do not bite the seriously injured or terminally ill, since they would be unsuitable hosts for viral reproduction. He suggests that they test this by deliberately infecting <b>somebody</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> pathogen from the facility, but the pathogens are stored in a wing already overrun by zombies. Gerry, Segen and the lead WHO doctor go to get a pathogen. As they fight their way through, they are separated; Gerry continues to the pathogen vault while Segen and the doctor return to the main building. A zombie corners Gerry inside the vault, prompting him to inject himself with an unknown pathogen and open the vault, thereby testing his theory. The zombie ignores him, as do those he encounters while returning to the main building. Everybody rejoices at Gerry's success.|$|E
500|$|I wanted <b>somebody</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{tremendous}} {{understanding of}} how to make a pop video, because my biggest challenge working with directors is that I am the director and I write the treatments and I get the fashion and I decide what it's about and it's very hard to find directors that will relinquish any sort of input from the artist. ... But Francis and I worked together. ... It was collaborative. He's a really pop video director and a filmmaker. He did I Am Legend and I'm a huge Will Smith fan, so I knew he could execute the video in a way that I could give him all my weirdest, most psychotic ideas ... But it would come across to and be relevant to the public.|$|E
500|$|The Sands of Time {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} upon launch. Edge said that, despite difficulty spikes caused by respawning enemies, [...] "the game cannot be commended highly enough". IGN's Matt Casamassina found the entire experience enjoyable, saying that [...] "Whether you're a diehard Prince of Persia fan or <b>somebody</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mild interest in action-adventures, The Sands of Time {{is a must}} own -- a soon-to-be-classic worthy of a permanent place in your collection". 1UP.com, while pointing out the camera control as [...] "tricky", said that the game [...] "will make your chest explode if you've got a heart condition (in a good way, of course)". GameSpot's Greg Kasavin called it [...] "a game that can be recommended wholeheartedly". Both Eurogamer and Official PlayStation Magazine positively compared the game's aesthetics and presentation to Ico. Francesca Reyes of Official Xbox Magazine gave the game a good review, praising the story and general gameplay, but finding the combat difficult at times and lack of new skills. In closing, she praised the game's lasting appeal: [...] "When {{the whole thing is}} over, it's perfectly timed to leave you wanting more. It's a stunning and rare achievement that makes you feel happy to be a gamer." [...] Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu gave the PS2 version a good review, saying that the action was smooth and challenging, bearing similarities to the original Prince of Persia, and one reviewer found the Prince [...] "colourful".|$|E

2500|$|The most {{important}} {{point about the}} Act {{is that there is}} some confusion about whom it covers. Most British people will be covered, but often vulnerable workers are not. Under section 230 of the Act the word [...] "employee" [...] is defined to mean <b>somebody</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> [...] "contract of employment". This in turn means someone who has a [...] "contract of service". In legal cases since the early 1980s, some judges have placed a restrictive interpretation on what that means. The opposite of a [...] "contract of service" [...] is a [...] "contract for services", and it is meant to draw the line between someone who is working for another, on their account, under their control and someone who is working on their own account, controlling their own work. In other words, it is meant to be the difference between the truly [...] "employed" [...] and the [...] "self employed".|$|E

He built strength and stamina by hurling car tires and hitting Wiffle balls with a heavy shovel, among other regimens.

40|$|The {{approval}} of major infrastructure and industrial developments is often {{dependent on the}} results of environmental and social impact assessments (EIA and SIA, respectively). Depending on the recommendations of ‘experts’ undertaking the assessments, projects are approved, rejected or modified to take account of unintended negative consequences. In practice, there are pressures on consultants to come up with favourable results, and unfavourable results are often ignored. These pressures may be subtle. For example, because consultants are usually employed by <b>somebody</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> interest in seeing projects go ahead, any consultant <b>with</b> <b>a</b> reputation for being too negative is unlikely to get work. The present paper explores issues faced by anthropologists in SIA, as well as the structure of interests within which SIA is carried out, and ways in which ethical dilemmas can be negotiated. It asks whether simply opting out of the process altogether is an ethical option preferable to critical engagement...|$|R
