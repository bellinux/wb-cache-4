40|$|Precipitates of {{a series}} of {{alkaline}} earth metal (barium and <b>strontium)</b> carbonates, <b>chromates,</b> phosphates, and sulfates were formed at high supersaturation by diffusion through silica hydrogel, agarose hydrogel, and the freshly developed agarosesilica mixed gels. The reaction vessels could be a small test tube, a recently designed standard micro slide cassette and a enlarged supercassette. Homogeneous nucleation is thought to have taken place, and particle development {{led to the formation of}} an unusual category of materials, known as Induced Morphology Crystal Aggregates [IMCA], at high pH under far-from-equilibrium conditions. Standard procedures were developed in order to produce homogeneous gels. Particle development led to characteristic style of pattern formation, which I have called monster, spiral, and flake. Among these IMCA, barium carbonate, chromate, and sulfate were moderately easy to grow. Barium phosphate was very difficult to grow as IMCA due to formation of poorly crystalline spherulites. IMCA of <b>strontium</b> carbonate, <b>chromate</b> and sulfate could be developed at high basic pH in the presence of silicate. Strontium carbonate sheet morphology displays a unique property, double internal layer structure, which was identified by backscattering electron imaging (BEI). Selected electron diffraction (SAD) revealed a new crystal phase which was called "Dentonite". Precipitate particles were isolated using a non-destructive isolation technique. Optical microscopy was widely used to examine particles in situ and scanning electron microscopy and X-ray dispersive energy (EDX) spectroscopy were applied to particles ex situ, together with ESCA for surface analysis. Growth patterns were found to be strongly dependent on pH. Other related pattern formation processes were also investigated including normal and dendritic structures, spherulitic structures and periodic pattern formation. Some interpretations were proposed in terms of mechanism. Chemical additive effects were examined experimentally in the calcium phosphate system.

Perovskite-type lanthanum strontium manganese (LSM) is also commonly used as a cathode material. Recent {{studies have found that}} doping LSM with scandium to form LSMS promotes mobility of oxide ions in the cathode, increasing reduction kinetics at the interface with the electrolyte and thus leading to higher performance at low temperatures than traditional LSM cells. However, further development of the sintering process parameters is required to prevent precipitation of scandium oxide into the LSM lattice. These precipitate particles are problematic because they can impede electron and ion conduction. In particular, the processing temperature and concentration of scandium in the LSM latice are being researched to optimize the properties of the LSMS cathode. New materials are being researched such as lanthanum <b>strontium</b> manganese <b>chromate</b> (LSCM), which has proven to be more stable under electrolysis conditions. LSCM has high redox stability, which is crucial especially at the interface with the electrolyte. Scandium-doped LCSM (LSCMS) is also being researched as a cathode material due to its high ionic conductivity. However, the rare-earth element introduces a significant materials cost and was found to cause a slight decrease in overall mixed conductivity. Nonetheless, LCSMS materials have demonstrated high efficiency at temperatures as low as 700 °C.|$|R

30|$|Access to the {{production}} records from W&N’s 19 th century archive database {{made it possible to}} carry out a comprehensive study of their manufacturing processes for yellow chromate pigments based on barium (BaCrO 4), zinc (4 ZnCrO 4 ·K 2 O· 3 H 2 O) and strontium (SrCrO 4). One hundred and three production records were found for the manufacture of Lemon Yellow (barium chromate, 69 %), Citron Yellow (zinc potassium chromate, 25 %) and Strontian Yellow (<b>strontium</b> <b>chromate,</b> 6 %). The majority covers the period between 1838 and 1871. Analysis of W&N’s production records indicates that one main synthetic pathway was found for each pigment.

There was no evidence that extenders were added during the synthesis of these pigments, whereas their production records for lead chromates do show the addition of extenders [25]. The lack of extenders for these pigments may infer that for W&N, extenders were primarily present to adjust physical properties, tinting strength or hue, rather than functioning predominantly as a means to reduce the cost of materials. The relative tinting strength (TS) of these pigments is lower than pure lead chromate pigments. It was calculated in comparison to pure lead chromate (PbCrO 4,) which was assigned a TS of 100 %. This resulted in a TS of 92 % for barium, 78 % for strontium and 65 % for zinc potassium chromate pigments.|$|E

3000|$|This work {{focuses on}} the study of the 19 th century yellow {{chromate}} pigments based on barium (BaCrO 4), zinc (4 ZnCrO 4 ·K 2 O· 3 H 2 O) and strontium (SrCrO 4). These pigments, which are reported to shift in hue and darken, have been found in 19 th century artworks. A better understanding of their historic manufacture will contribute to the visual/chemical interpretation of change in these colours. Research was carried out on the Winsor & Newton (W&N) 19 th century archive database providing a unique insight into their manufacturing processes. One hundred and three production records were found, 69 % for barium, 25 % for zinc and 6 % for strontium chromates, mainly under the names Lemon, Citron and Strontian Yellow, respectively. Analysis of the records shows that each pigment is characterised by only one synthetic pathway. The low number of records found for the production of <b>strontium</b> <b>chromate</b> suggests W&N was not selling this pigment formulation on a large scale. Furthermore, contrary to what the authors have discovered for W&N chrome yellow pigments, extenders were not added to these pigment formulations, most probably due to their lower tinting strength (TS). The latter was calculated in comparison to pure chrome yellow (PbCrO 4, 100 % TS) resulting in 92 % for barium, 65 % for zinc potassium and 78 % for <b>strontium</b> <b>chromate</b> pigments.

30|$|The pigment {{composition}} {{in the production}} records is in agreement with W&N’s declaration of their pigment compositions from 18921 where Lemon Yellow is described as chromate of barium and Citron Yellow is given as chromate of zinc. On the other hand, it is notable that Strontian Yellow {{is not included in}} W&N’s 1892 declaration. Its absence is likely because it was considered too fugitive for W&N and may explain why there are so few records for the production of <b>strontium</b> <b>chromate.</b> Evidence for this assumption appears in a book belonging to Arthur Henry Newton (son of W&N’s founder Henry Charles Newton). Associated with a recipe for a physical mixture of Lemon Yellow (barium chromate) with Citron Yellow (zinc potassium chromate) which appears under the name: “Strontian Yellow: No. 2 for Oil”, dated 23 / 11 / 1859, is a note: “In Father’s opinion this is a much safer color to use in oil than Chromate of Strontia” (W&N Database Unique Recipe Code: P 2 P 264 AL 07). In W&N’s 1892 declaration, this physical mixture appears under the name Primrose Yellow and is described as “similar in colour to the old ‘Strontian Yellow’ (Chromate of Strontium) but keeps its colour better”. Despite this observation both Citron Yellow and Primrose Yellow were nevertheless designated fugitive in oil in W&N’s 1892 declaration, with only Lemon Yellow considered permanent in oil. Interestingly, this is contrary to the position of Jehan-Georges Vibert, a 19 th century authority on painting materials and supplier as well as consultant to the 19 th century artists’ colourman Lefranc & Co. [3, 5]. He placed <b>strontium</b> <b>chromate</b> in a list of permanent or “good” pigments, together with zinc chromate whereas barium chromate belonged to the list of “bad” pigments (he declared lead chromate pigments “more or less bad”) [26].|$|E

MAS spectra in cubic and tetragonal SACr are indistinguishable, compatible with a phase transition mainly due to conformational shearing of the four-membered rings of the framework. In the orthorhombic phases of CAW and SACr, at least four different Al-sites can be distinguished: the MAS spectra suggest that the Al sites in the two compds. are very similar.

In this work we explore a novel tridimensional Quantitative-Structure Property Relationship (3 D-QSPR) approach, comparative molecular surface analysis (CoMSA), which was developed to recognize "high-performing" corrosion inhibitor candidates from the distributions of electronegativity, polarizability and van der Waals volume on the molecular surfaces of 28 small organic molecules. Multivariate statistical analysis identified five prototypes molecules, which are capable of explaining 71 % of the variance within the inhibitor data set; whilst a further five molecules were also identified as archetypes, describing 75 % of data variance. All active corrosion inhibitors, at a 80 % threshold, were successfully recognized by the CoMSA model with adequate specificity and precision higher than 70 % and 60 %, respectively. The model was also capable of identifying structural patterns, that revealed reasonable starting points for where structural changes may augment corrosion inhibition efficacy.

The relatively high operating temperatures and the anode’s catalytic activity enable {{the use of a}} broad variety of fuels which speeds up their commercialization. However, the issue of relatively high degradation and long-term stability is still an area of intense research, funded by various programs and agencies worldwide. In this Ph.

First, the influence of chromia on the oxygen uptake of YSZ (an electrolyte material) and LSCF (a cathode material) was measured via oxygen 18 tracer diffusion. The acquired diffusion profiles measured by secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) showed the dependence of the surface exchange coefficient keff on the thickness of a Cr 2 O 3 surface layer and the substrate material. Second, the Sr segregation of LSCF was investigated via x-ray absorption spectroscopy and Sr on the surface was distinguished from the bulk Sr via formation of <b>strontium</b> <b>chromate.</b> The acid-base reaction of gaseous chromia with the SrO {{on the surface of the}} sample was used to measure the Sr segregation as a function of applied bias potential. The fundamental difference in the dependence of the cathode and anode side’s segregation in the bias potential gave clues towards the underlying Sr segregation mechanism. Finally, a completely new method, x-ray absorption mapping (XAM) was used to measure the Sr segregation in symmetric model cells with cathode thicknesses of 10 nm. The acquired information about the morphological change of the cathode together with the spatial information across the whole sample surface made the connection of Sr segregation and oxygen exchange in the sample evident. These three topics show not only the various ways of degradation but also the numerous ways to approach these problems using a multitude of surface science techniques and combining them to draw a more complete picture of the cathode degradation...|$|E
