The concept of a package seal is not new and dates back to {{the early days of the}} pipeline industry when they were supplied to seal split case pumps. What is new is the bolt-on feature of the symmetrical seal, freeing the seal design from the space required for packing. This freedom allows the seal manufacturers to include such sealing features like upstream pumping, when required...|$|R
5000|$|On a boat {{having an}} inboard motor that turns a shaft {{attached}} to an external propeller, the shaft passes though a <b>stuffing</b> <b>box,</b> also termed a 'stern gland' in this application. The <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> prevents sea water {{from entering the}} boat's hull. In many small fiberglass boats, for example, the <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> is mounted inboard near the point the shaft exits the hull. The [...] "box" [...] is a cylindrical assembly, typically of bronze, comprising a sleeve threaded on one end to accept adjusting and locking nuts. A special purpose heavy-duty rubber hose attaches the <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> to a stern tube, also called a shaft log, that projects inward from the hull. Marine-duty hose clamps secure the hose to the stern tube and the <b>stuffing</b> <b>box.</b> A sound <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> installation is critical to safety because failure can admit a catastrophic volume of water into the boat.|$|R
40|$|The Hydro-Balanced <b>Stuffing</b> <b>Box</b> is a seal {{assembly}} for polished rod pumping installations commonly used in oil and gas pumping well installations to contain produced well fluids. The improved <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> was developed and patented by Harold H. Palmour of The Palmour Group of Livingston, TX. The <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> is designed to {{reduce the incidence of}} seal leakage and to utilize an environmentally safe fluid, so that if there is any leakage, environmental damage is reduced or eliminated. The unit was tested on two wells at the Rocky Mountain Oilfield Testing Center. During the test period, the performance of the <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> was measured by monitoring the pressure on the tubing and the inner chamber with a Barton Two-pen recorder. The amount of safe fluid consumed, fluid leakage {{at the top of the}} <b>stuffing</b> <b>box,</b> pressure supplied from the nitrogen bottle, ambient temperature, and polish rod temperature was recorded. The <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> is capable of providing a better seal between well fluids an d the environment than conventional <b>stuffing</b> <b>boxes.</b> It allows the polished rod to operate cooler and with lubrication, extending the life of the packing elements, and reducing the amount of attention required to prevent leakage...|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 57 In recent years, cooling {{requirements}} for mechanical seals {{have become a}} subject of controversial opinions. While the maximum limiting temperatures of mechanical seals are known and specified by seal manufacturers, the actual temperatures in the sealing cavity of the pump <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> during pump operation are not readily available. A conservative approach has been to provide extra cooling to the <b>stuffing</b> <b>box.</b> However, the availability of clean cooling water is often scarce in many installations, and therefore, knowledge of the thermal behavior of the sealing cavity region becomes important. A developed analytical method, which utilizes the finite element analysis (FEA) technique to determine the thermal behavior of the pump <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> in the sealing region is presented. A single-stage overhung hot water (590 ?F) boiler circulation pump was analyzed. The <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> of the pump described herein the paper was equipped with API plan 23.

40|$|This {{technology}} {{provides a}} simple yet clever idea for preventing oil and saltwater polluting spills by sucker rod pumping oil wells, {{as well as}} prolonging {{the life of the}} <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> seals and pressure lubricating the polished rod. This objective is accomplished by introducing a non-polluting, food grade, high viscosity lubricant into the void space between two sets of seals in a typical <b>stuffing</b> <b>box.</b> This safe-fluid acts as a sacrificial fluid that will be the fluid that is exposed to the atmosphere when the primary seal in the <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> leaks for any reason. In addition, the pressure on this sacrificial safe-fluid is maintained at the same pressure as the pressure on the produced fluid in the flow line at the pumping tee, thereby equalizing the pressure across the secondary seal in the <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> that separates the safe-fluid from the produced fluid. The unique feature, of equalizing the pressure across the secondary seal, is accomplished by using a pressure transmitter which is monitoring the pressure in the flow line (which is the fluid under the secondary seal) and transmitting that pressure to the safe-fluid (which is the fluid above the secondary seal) thereby equalizing the pressure across this secondary seal. The primary seal will be sealing the safe-fluid and will be operating under optimum conditions, extending the life of this primary seal. The principle of the invention was proven by equipping eight oil wells with Field Retro-Fit Packages of Independent component parts to hydro-balance the existing <b>stuffing</b> <b>boxes...</b>|$|R

50|$|A <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> of a {{sailboat}} {{will have a}} stern tube that's slightly bigger than the prop shaft. It will also have packing nut threads or a gland nut. The packing is inside the gland nut and creates the seal. The shaft is wrapped by the packing {{and put in the}} gland nut. Through tightening it onto the stern tube, the packing is compressed, creating a seal against the shaft. Creating a proper plunger alignment is critical for correct flow and a long wear life. <b>Stuffing</b> <b>box</b> components are of stainless steel, brass or other application-specific materials.|$|R

40|$|Lecturepg. 3 Many {{facilities}} do {{not obtain}} the expected {{life out of}} ANSI and other centrifugal pumps, seals, and bearings {{that need to be}} obtained to be competitive in today?s market place. The analysis of this situation leads to two industry wide flaws. The first problem {{is that many of the}} pumps were never initially installed correctly. This shortcut on the initial installation leads to a lifetime of high and unnecessary maintenance costs, along with the process leaks, excess emissions, and wasted man-hours spent on fighting a losing battle. And a lifetime is accurate, as some centrifugal pumps have been in service for over 33 years. Once a pump is misinstalled, it is very difficult to get approval to spend the time, effort, and dollars to reinstall a pump that is already operating, albeit at a high maintenance cost. Production will most always take precedence. With typical chemical plants operating over 330 days a year, time is limited for such ?unimportant? projects as pump reinstallation. This is why correctly installing an ANSI, or any pump, initially is so critical to trouble free operation. The second flaw is that many of the mechanical seals are operating in <b>stuffing</b> <b>boxes</b> designed for <b>packing.</b> The new technology in current ANSI pumps designed to operate using mechanical seals is worth the conversion cost. End users need to know the benefits of the new seal chambers on the market. It is documented that converting to the four degree taper seal chamber alone has increased seal life three fold on specific applications. Enacting a solution to poor pump installations is a long and tedious mission, but one that can be accomplished. It does require using sound engineering principals to justify the costs needed to remedy the problem. A user might need to test principles that other end users already take for common practice. The twelve steps that were used to justify the reinstallation and upgrading of current problem pumps are reviewed herein. Several of the steps are worked on simultaneously...|$|R

40|$|Lecturepg. 88 The {{majority}} of horizontally split multistage pumps were designed when packing {{was the only}} cost effective method of sealing the pumpage from atmosphere. As a result, even modern pumps employ a <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> pressure equalization line (balance line) to lower <b>stuffing</b> <b>box</b> pressures. This technique of pressure equalization has a major drawback: reduced pump efficiency. The work that is done on the fluid that is throttled back to suction through the balance line is lost and acts to reduce the useful work done by the pump.

The modern solution to this problem is to eliminate the balance line and apply a correctly specified mechanical seal to the high pressure side of the pump.
