He grew up in Raynham, Massachusetts and, even as a child, he {{demonstrated}} the adventurous character that would later earn him the Medal of Honor. As a four-year-old, he disappeared from the backyard one day, and his mother found him later on hanging by the hood of his sweatshirt on the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence.</b> On another occasion, a migraine headache kept him home from school, but he left the house and was later found climbing a tree. In 1994 he graduated from Bridgewater-Raynham Regional High School {{at the age of}} 18. Monti had two siblings, a sister, Nicole and a brother, Timothy.|$|E

During the same period about 80,000 PAVN troops made the trip south. A new North Vietnamese logistical effort, discovered by U.S. intelligence in late 1968, was a petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL) pipeline running southwest from the North Vietnamese city of Vinh. By early the following year the pipeline had crossed the Laotian frontier and by summer it had reached Muong Nong and the approaches to the A Sầu Valley. The plastic line, assisted by numerous small pumping stations, could transfer diesel fuel, gasoline, and kerosene all in the same pipe.|$|E

5|$|Leslie quickly seeks revenge against Lindsay {{by getting}} her parks {{employees}} to throw garbage over the Eagleton <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence.</b> When Lindsay arrives to stop it, the two {{get into a}} fight amid the garbage bags. The police arrive and arrest both women: Lindsay is jailed in Pawnee, while Leslie is jailed in Eagleton's pristine and hotel-like holding cell. After Ann bails Leslie out, she tells her that Lindsay built the fence because she is jealous that Leslie was offered the Eagleton job first and wants to get a rise out of her. Ann suggests that Lindsay should be hit with a baseball bat, which gives Leslie the idea to turn Pawnee's side of Lafayette Park into a wiffle ball field, with the fence serving as the outfield wall. Lindsay is impressed by how fast Leslie turned the fence into something positive, and remembers why she and Leslie joined the parks department in the first place. With their relationship on the mend, the two agree {{to get a drink}} together. Later, Leslie returns to the office to throw Ron's party: she takes him to an empty room with steak, whiskey and his favorite movies waiting for him, and reveals that April and Andy's duties were false leads to trick him. Leslie explains she made a party that he would want and leaves a content Ron alone to enjoy his birthday.|$|E

Essentially, the horse takes the first two steps of a galloping stride on the take-off <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence,</b> {{and the other two}} steps on the landing side. A horse has to collect its hindquarters after a jump to strike off into the next stride.|$|E

The children entertain themselves with endurance games, such as holding their hands under hot water. They believe they have a brother on the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> to whom they throw supplies. The parents reward good behaviour with stickers and bad with violence.|$|E
25|$|The {{upper part}} of the fell, in excess of a mile square, is soft, peaty and drab. The {{exception}} is the ridge itself, which is considerably wetter. A fence runs along the ridge, a useful guide in mist and occasionally necessary for bog bouncing. The summit is set on a small rock platform with an Ordnance Survey column. A rocky knoll (called Man) stands on the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence.</b> The views are extensive due to the central location and a lack of higher neighbours. The Helvellyn range is seen end to end, together with a panorama of high fells {{on the other side of}} the ridge from Crinkle Crags in the south to Blencathra in the north.|$|E
25|$|On May 27, 1995, Reeve's horse made a refusal. Witnesses {{said that}} the horse began the third fence jump and {{suddenly}} stopped. Reeve fell forward off the horse, {{holding on to the}} reins. His hands somehow became tangled in the reins, and the bridle and bit were pulled off the horse. He landed head first on the far <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence,</b> shattering his first and second vertebrae. This cervical spinal injury, which paralyzed him from the neck down, also halted his breathing. Paramedics arrived three minutes later and immediately took measures to get air into his lungs. He was taken first to the local hospital, before being flown by helicopter to the University of Virginia Medical Center. Afterwards, he had no recollection of the accident. Due to this injury, Armand Assante replaced Reeve for the role of Alan Breck Stewart in Kidnapped.|$|E

25|$|The Grenztruppen {{also had}} the task of {{gathering}} intelligence on West German and NATO activities across the border line. This task was performed primarily by the Grenzaufklärungszug (GAK), an elite reconnaissance force within the Grenztruppen. These became a familiar sight for Western observers of the border as the GAK troopers, uniquely, were tasked with patrolling {{the western side of}} the border fence– i.e. in the outer strip, adjoining the geographical border between the two German states. Not surprisingly, given that they could defect with only a few footsteps in the right direction, the GAKs were drawn from the most politically reliable echelons of the Grenztruppen. They worked closely with the Stasi and were often seen photographing targets across the border. They also guarded work detachments carrying out maintenance work on the western <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence.</b> The workers would be covered by machine guns to discourage them from attempting to escape.|$|E
25|$|The {{camp was}} never finished, and its {{structures}} were looted in 1941. As a result, {{it was in}} poor shape when the first prisoners arrived, and the situation would deteriorate further in the months to come, when the camp came under German control. The camp had a roughly rectangular shape, surrounded by a triple barbed wire fence, with guard towers at every 200 m. The camp's gate was on the western <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence.</b> Most buildings were clustered on the northern half of the camp. Blocks 1 to 4 were located there, built in a staggered line towards the East. These were two-storey barracks buildings, divided in two equal but separate sections, western and eastern, with separate entrances to each. In addition, the north-eastern corner housed storage houses, the mess hall, the baths (Block 16), where the women's solitary confinement cells were also located, the workshops (Block 21) and the camp headquarters (Block 20). The infamous Block 15, located {{to the east of}} the headquarters, was the solitary confinement facility, with the camp guard's quarters and mess room. In the south-eastern corner there was the isolated women's wing (Block 6). Under the Germans, the first floor housed Jewish women, while the second floor was reserved for Christians. In total, over 300 Christian and 2,500 Jewish women passed through Haidari beginning on 7 December 1943, including heroines of the Resistance such as Iro Konstantopoulou or Lela Karagianni (executed on 5 and 8 September 1944 respectively).|$|E
500|$|The bridge section has {{the girls}} laying in water while snow starts to fall. At the last {{portion of the}} chorus, t.A.T.u. are portrayed {{pointing}} in different directions, until they both walk around corner and see a vast field, where the sun is breaking out of the clouds; they clasp hands and walk off into the distance. The {{people on the other}} <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> are left in an eerie green light with rain falling steadily; it is also revealed that they are the ones isolated behind the fence.

50|$|Additionally, <b>the</b> {{disappearance}} <b>of</b> dingoes might increase <b>the</b> prevalence <b>of</b> kangaroo, {{rabbit and}} turkey numbers. In the areas outside <b>the</b> Dingo <b>Fence,</b> <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> dingoes and emus {{is lower than}} in the areas inside. However, the numbers changed depending on the habitat. Since the environment is the same on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence,</b> <b>the</b> dingo {{was assumed to be}} a strong factor for <b>the</b> regulation <b>of</b> these species. Therefore, some people demand that dingo numbers should be allowed to increase or dingoes should be reintroduced in areas with low dingo populations to lower the pressure on endangered populations of native species and to reintroduce them in certain areas. In addition, <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Australian brushturkey in Queensland increased significantly after dingo baiting was conducted.|$|R

500|$|Although {{popularly known}} as Chincoteague ponies, the feral ponies {{actually}} live on Assateague Island. [...] Although the entire Island {{is owned by the}} federal government, Assateague is split by a fence at the Maryland/Virginia state line, with a herd of around 150 ponies living on each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence.</b> The herds live on land managed by two different federal agencies with very different management strategies. Ponies from the Maryland herd, referred to in literature of the National Park Service as Assateague horses, live within Assateague Island National Seashore. They are generally treated as wild animals, given no more or less assistance than other species on the island, other than to be treated with contraceptives to prevent overpopulation. [...] Conversely, the Virginia herd, referred to as Chincoteague ponies, lives within the Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge but is owned by the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Company. The Virginia ponies are treated to twice yearly veterinary inspections, which prepare them for life among the general equine population if they are sold at auction. While only around 300 ponies live on Assateague Island, around 1,000 more live off-island, having been purchased or bred by private breeders.|$|E
500|$|... "Gethsemane" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. Lon Grahnke of Chicago Sun-Times reacted positively toward the episode, {{calling it a}} [...] "stunning" [...] season finale. Paula Vitaris, writing for Cinefantastique, rated [...] "Gethsemane" [...] two stars out of four, noting that it [...] "withholds so much information that it barely qualifies as a complete episode". Vitaris felt that the large degree of ambiguity in the episode's script left the actors' performances [...] "curiously neutral", adding that the cast [...] "struggle manfully" [...] with the material. Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen rated the episode a B+, noting that [...] "everything here has a ring of familiarity to it". Handlen felt that the episode's premise and ending were poorly executed, as [...] "trying to balance possible truths while maintaining the plausibility of both is incredibly difficult to pull off on a long-running show", adding that the episode [...] "comes down on the only <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> it really could" [...] given that [...] "there've been too many scenes of shape-changing bounty hunters and mystical alien healers to really let this idea play out know [...] in any real way". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five, noting that while it [...] "attempts to do too much", it [...] "has a passion behind it which makes it gripping". Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode's cliffhanger ending, centering on the apparent death of Mulder, was too unbelievable, noting {{that it would be}} out of character for him to grow so disillusioned as to take his own life. In the 1999 FX Thanksgiving Marathon, containing fan-selected episodes, [...] "Gethsemane" [...] (along with [...] "Redux" [...] and [...] "Redux II") was presented as the [...] "Best Mythology Episode".|$|E

Chima was the winner. On Day 34, HouseGuests competed in [...] "The Goods" [...] luxury competition. For this competition, actor Jeremy Piven entered the house to inform the HouseGuests of the competition. The HouseGuests split into teams and were required to fill a station wagon with various items that were worth different amounts of points; the team would only earn a point for the items they successfully fit into their car, and {{the team with the}} most points would earn the right to see the film The Goods. The team of Chima, Jordan, Jessie, Natalie, and Russell won the competition, meaning Jeff, Kevin, Lydia, and Michele were the Have-Nots for the week. Later that day, Chima chose to nominate Lydia and Russell for eviction. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Jeff, Kevin, and Natalie were selected to compete; Michele was selected to host. On Day 35, HouseGuests {{competed in the}} [...] "BB Farm" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were required to reach through a fence and attempt to get twelve eggs from the opposite <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fence</b> to them; the first HouseGuest to successfully get twelve eggs would win the Power of Veto. Kevin was the winner of the Power of Veto. On Day 37, Kevin chose not to use the Power of Veto on either nominee. On Day 40, Jeff chose to use the Coup d'État, thus overthrowing Head of Household Chima. He chose to remove both Lydia and Russell from the block, replacing them with Jessie and Natalie. Due to using the Coup d'État, Jeff was ineligible to vote during this eviction, as was Chima. Jessie then became the fifth HouseGuest to be evicted from the house in a vote of three to two. He became the first member of the Jury of Seven.|$|E
