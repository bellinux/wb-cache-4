40|$|The Space Shuttle orbiter <b>skin</b> <b>panels</b> were {{analyzed}} under pressure loads simulating hydrodynamic loads {{to determine their}} capability to sustain a potential ditching and to determine pressures that typically would produce failures. Two Dynamic Crash Analysis of Structures (DYCAST) finite element models were used.

Extremely high pressure loads which are produced under hydrodynamic planning conditions far exceed the very low predicted failure pressures for the <b>skin</b> <b>panels.</b> Consequently, a ditching of the orbiter is not considered to have a high probability of success and should not be considered a means of emergency landing unless no other option exists...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In the {{competitive}} environment of aircraft industries it becomes absolutely necessary {{to improve the}} efficiency, performance of the aircrafts to reduce the development and operating costs considerably, in order to capitalize the market. An important contribution to improve the efficiency and performance {{can be achieved by}} decreasing the aircraft weight through considerable usage of composite materials in primary aircraft structures. In this study, a type of composite material called Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) is explored for the usage is aircraft skin panels. Even though there were plenty of studies and research has been already carried out, here a practical example of an aircraft <b>skin</b> <b>panel</b> is taken and substantiated the benefits of composites material usage over the metallic <b>skin</b> <b>panel.</b> A crown <b>skin</b> <b>panel</b> of a commercial aircraft is designed using both metal and composite materials. Stress analysis has been carried out for both and margin of safety is estimated for the critical load cases. The skin panels are compared for manufacturing, tooling, assembly and cost parameters. Detail step by step comparison between metal and composite constructions are studied and results are tabulated for better understanding...|$|E

The heated <b>skin</b> <b>panel</b> analyzed was rectangular in shape and contained a small square cool region at its center. The wing skin immediately outside the cool region was found to be close to the state of elastic instability in the chordwise direction based on the conservative temperature distribution. The wing skin was found to be quite stable in the spanwise direction. The potential wing skin thermal instability was not severe enough to tear apart the strain isolation pad (SIP) layer. Also, the preflight thermal stress analysis was performed on the TPS tile under the most severe temperature gradient during the simulated reentry heating. The tensile thermal stress induced in the TPS tile was found to be much lower than the tensile strength of the TPS material.

40|$|This is {{the second}} part {{on the design of}} a high aspect ratio HALE-UAV wing using {{composite}} materials. The first paper deals only with the static strength analysis. This paper is a continuation of the first paper and presents buckling and flutters analysis. The wing was made of a carbon/epoxy laminate with orthotropic arrangement, [0 °/ 0 °/ 45 °/- 45 °]ѕ. Buckling phenomenon was evaluated only at the upper wing box <b>skin</b> <b>panel</b> and used linear analytical equation to determine the critical buckling load in each <b>skin</b> <b>panel.</b> The results showed that the upper wing skin was not safe from buckling and it needs structural thickness improvement. Flutter analysis was then performed on this configuration by using numerical approach based on finite element structural models and doublet lattice method.

It was found that the designed wing structure has high flutter speed and it was safe from flutter phenomenon...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{accuracy}} of sound transmission loss (TL) predictions of aircraft double-walls using {{transfer matrix method}} (TMM) and statistical energy analysis (SEA) is examined in this paper. The studied system is composed of: (1) a laminate composite <b>skin</b> <b>panel</b> whose critical frequency is around 4000 Hz, (2) an air gap partially filled with a fibrous layer and (3) a sandwich trim panel with critical frequency around 2500 Hz. The structure is submitted to a diffuse acoustic field in the frequency range from 100 Hz to 10 kHz. A transfer path analysis shows that for this structure, including a highly-radiating trim with a low critical frequency, the resonant transmission through the cavity between panels is dominant over a large frequency range. This transmission path is not accounted for in the TMM formulation, resulting in an overestimation of the transmission loss compared to measurements and SEA computation. On the other hand, for practical purposes, both approaches are able to predict the impact in the TL of modifying {{the parameters of the}} <b>skin</b> <b>panel</b> for frequencies below its critical frequency...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{approach}} {{based on}} a displacement compatibility model is presented for both riveted and bonded stiffened composite panels containing impact damage. This repre-sents the first application of the displacement compatibility model to the failure analysis of impacted stiffened composite panels, and some new results are obtained for the impact dam-age tolerance properties of stiffened composite panels. In the present analysis, the previous displacement compatibility model for a stringer/orthotropic <b>skin</b> <b>panel</b> is improved for a stringer/unbalanced <b>skin</b> <b>panel.</b> The impact damage is simplified as an elliptic hole based on the compressive failure mechanisms of impacted composite laminates and stiffened panels. Predictions for failure loads and damage arrest capability agree well with experimental re-sults for several composite panel configurations. The important results obtained in this study are: (1) damage arrest capability {{is dominated by the}} strength of the skin/stringer attachment; (2) distinct two-stage failure shows that the riveted panels have significant damage arrest ca-pability due to the high shear strength of the rivets; and (3) since the very low shear strength of the skin/stringer attachment, the co-cured panels have no damage arrest capability.

The cargo ramp aft region was selected as being a helicopter airframe surface subjected to possible significant field damage and would permit {{an evaluation of the}} long term durability of the composite <b>skin</b> <b>panel.</b> A structural analysis was performed and the skin shears determined. Single lap joints of K/E riveted to aluminum were statically tested. The joint tests were used to determine bearing allowables and the required K/E skin gage. The K/E skin panels riveted to aluminum edge members were tested in a shear fixture to confirm the allowable shear and bearing strengths. Impact tests were conducted on aluminum skin panels to determine energy level and damage relationship. The K/E skin panels of various ply orientations and laminate thicknesses were then impacted at similar energy levels. The results of the analysis and tests were used to determine the required K/E skin gages in each of the end two bays of the ramp...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} disclosed here is {{a method}} for forming and curing an intricate structure of criss-crossing composite stringers and frames that are bonded to a <b>skin</b> <b>panel.</b> A structure constructed {{in accordance with the}} invention would be well-suited for use as a portion of an aircraft fuselage, a boat hull, or the like. The method is preferably practiced by applying uncured composite stringers to an uncured composite sheet panel. This is followed by placing cured frames crosswise over the stringers. The frames have openings at the locations where they intersect with the stringers which enables the frames to come into direct contact with the skin along most of their length. During the forming and curing process, the stringers are covered with a plurality of cauls, and the entire assembly of <b>skin</b> <b>panel,</b> stringers, frames and cauls is subjected to a vacuum bagging and curing process. The cauls serve to maintain both part shape and to control the flow of resin within the stringers as they are cured. Further, they probably eliminate the need for intermediate protective materials between the vacuum bag and the stringers...|$|E
