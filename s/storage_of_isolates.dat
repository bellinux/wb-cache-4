Comparison {{was made with}} two methods of tube coagulase testing and five slide methods for detecting clumping factor (slide coagulase testing). Performances were assessed for two groups of organisms, staphylococcal species alone and a combined staphylococcal and non-staphylococcal species group. The effects of growth on selective media and <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> <b>isolates</b> at room temperature and 4 degrees C were investigated. Selective media cannot be recommended, nor can <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> <b>isolates</b> before testing. Ranked according to efficiency value with the combined staphylococcal and non-staphylococcal species group, the kits and coagulase methods performed as follows (the figures in parentheses are the efficiency values for the staphylococcal group alone) : tube coagulase reference method 100 % (100 %), tube coagulase SJH method 99 % (99 %), Staphaurex 94 % (97 %), Staphylase 93 % (96 %), slide coagulase method No 4 93 % (94 %), slide coagulase method No 5 93 % (93 %), Bacto Latex 92 % (95 %), Staphyslide 92 % (95 %), and Biostaph 87 % (91 %). It is concluded that a commercial S aureus identification kit should not replace tube coagulase testing for the routine identification of the organism from primary plates and that, even the kits with the best performances, have little advantage over a good slide coagulase test method...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Group A β-haemolytic Streptococcus (GAS), a Gram-positive bacterium, {{also known}} as Streptococcus pyogenes, causes pyoderma, pharyngitis and {{invasive}} disease. Repeated GAS infections may lead to autoimmune diseases such as acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and rheumatic heart disease (RHD). Invasive GAS (iGAS) disease is an important cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. The burden of GAS infections is, however, unknown in Africa {{because of lack of}} surveillance systems. Methods and analysis: The African group A streptococcal infection registry (the AFROStrep study) is a collaborative multicentre study of clinical, microbiological, epidemiological and molecular characteristics for GAS infection in Africa. The AFROStrep registry comprises two components: (1) active surveillance of GAS pharyngitis cases from sentinel primary care centres (non-iGAS) and (2) passive surveillance of iGAS disease from microbiology laboratories. Isolates will also be subjected to DNA isolation to allow for characterisation by molecular methods and cryopreservation for long-term storage. The AFROStrep study seeks to collect comprehensive data on GAS isolates in Africa. The biorepository will serve as a platform for vaccine development in Africa. Ethics and dissemination: Ethics approval for the AFROStrep registry has been obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee at the University of Cape Town (HREC/REF: R 006 / 2015). Each recruiting site will seek ethics approval from their local ethics’ committee. All participants will be required to provide consent for inclusion into the registry {{as well as for the}} <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> <b>isolates</b> and molecular investigations to be conducted thereon. Strict confidentiality will be applied throughout. Findings and updates will be disseminated to collaborators, researchers, health planners and colleagues through peer-reviewed journal articles, conference publications and proceedings...|$|E

40|$|Cryopreservation {{of human}} blood vessels may become an {{important}} tool in bypass surgery and peripheral vascular reconstruction. Ideally cryopreservation of a blood vessel should preserve functional characteristics {{comparable to those of}} fresh controls. The key advantage of cryopreservation is the fact that storage at deep subzero temperatures allows <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> structurally intact living vascular tissues for virtually infinite time. Originally developed for long-time <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> <b>isolated</b> cells, the techniques of cryopreservation of tissues are challenged by the fact that these are complex multicellular systems containing diverse types of cells with differing requirements for optimal preservation. Therefore, the post-thaw functional activity of vascular tissues is determined by the type of blood vessel and, in addition, by the cell packing effect. Moreover, evidence from pharmacological studies suggests that cryopreservation induces tissue specific changes in transmembrane signaling and the mechanisms coupling intracellular calcium release, sensitivity and calcium entry into the smooth muscle cells...|$|R

Trends in vancomycin and daptomycin susceptibility were evaluated by using Etest performed prospectively on isolates in routine clinical practice from December 2007 to December 2010 (n 102). Comparison was made to results from pro-spective testing of subcultures at the Scottish MRSA Reference Laboratory, using an automated system (Vitek 2) and retrospec-tive testing (Etest and CLSI reference broth microdilution [BMD] method) of stored isolates from 2006 to 2010 (n 208). Spear-man’s rank correlations revealed {{a significant increase in}} vancomycin MIC (P 0. 012) and a significant decrease in daptomycin MIC (P 0. 03) by year of study for Etest results from the time of isolation. However, neither trend was replicated in MICs from automated or retrospective testing. The Friedman test revealed a significant difference between vancomycin MICs obtained from the same samples by different testing methods (2 [3 degrees of freedom] 97; P< 0. 001). MICs from automated testing and Etest analysis of stored isolates were significantly lower than those from Etest analysis at the time of isolation for both antibiotics (P< 0. 001). Effects of storage on the MIC appeared within the first 6 months of storage. Inconsistent evidence on vancomycin MIC creep and the relevance of the MIC to clinical outcome may arise from differences in susceptibility testing methods, includ-ing <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> <b>isolates.</b> There is a need to standardize and streamline susceptibility testing of vancomycin against MRSA.

40|$|Until recently, morphotyping, {{a method}} {{evaluating}} fringe and surface characteristics of streak colonies grown on malt agar, has been recommended {{as a simple}} and unexpensive typing method for Candida albicans isolates. The discriminatory power and reproducibility of Hunter’s modified scheme of Phongpaichit’s morphotyping has been evaluated on 28 C. albicans isolates recovered from the oral cavity of asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus-positive subjects, and compared to two molecular typing methods: randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fingerprinting, and contour clamped homogeneous electric field (CHEF) electrophoretic karyotyping. Morpho-logical features of streak colonies allowed to distinguish 11 different morphotypes while RAPD fingerprinting yielded 25 different patterns and CHEF electrophoresis recognized 9 karyotypes. The discriminatory power calcu-lated with the formula of Hunter and Gaston was 0. 780 for morphotyping, 0. 984 for RAPD fingerprinting, and 0. 630 for karyotyping. Reproducibility was tested using 43 serial isolates from 15 subjects (2 to 6 isolates per subject) and by repeating the test after one year <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> the <b>isolates.</b> While genetic methods generally recognized a single type for all serial <b>isolates</b> from each <b>of</b> the subjects studied, morphotyping detected strain variations in five subjects {{in the absence of}} genetic confirmation.

40|$|OXIDATION of {{constituents}} of serum lipoproteins to form compounds of higher molecular weight has been postulated {{as one of}} the initiating steps in the patho-genesis of atherosclerosis. 1 Studies <b>of</b> <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> <b>isolated</b> lipoproteins have shown that oxida-tive reactions occur which result in a shift of the low-density lipoprotein pattern toward lower So values. 2 Hence, if the postulated in vivo oxidation of lipoproteins plays a signifi-cant role in determining the observed lipopro-tein levels, then increasing the serum concen-tration of an antioxidant might result in a shift in the pattern toward higher Sf values.

40|$|Introduction: Clinical {{reasoning}} {{is essential for}} the practice of medicine. In theory of development of medical expertise it is stated, that clinical reasoning starts from analytical processes namely the <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> <b>isolated</b> facts and the logical application of the ‘rules’ of diagnosis. Then the learners successively develop so called semantic networks and illness-scripts which finally are used in an intuitive non-analytic fashion [1], [2]. The script concordance test (SCT) is an example for assessing clinical reasoning [3]. However the aggregate scoring [3] of the SCT is recognized as problematic [4]. The SCT`s scoring leads to logical inconsistencies and is likely to reflect construct-irrelevant differences in examinees’ response styles [4]. Also the expert panel judgments might lead to an unintended error of measurement [4]. In this PhD project the following research questions will be addressed: 1. How does a format look like to assess clinical reasoning (similar to the SCT but) with multiple true-false questions or other formats with unambiguous correct answers, and by this address the above mentioned pitfalls in traditional scoring of the SCT? 2. How well does this format fulfill the Ottawa criteria for good assessment, with special regards to educational and catalytic effects [5]? Methods: 1. In a first study it shall be assessed whether designing a new format using multiple true-false items to assess clinical reasoning similar to the SCT-format is arguable in a theoretically and practically sound fashion. For this study focus groups or interviews with assessment experts and students will be undertaken. 2.

40|$|Due to the {{scarcity}} of available human livers, porcine hepatocytes are currently being evaluated as a xenogeneic cell source for extracorporeal bioartificial liver (BAL). Hypothermic <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> <b>isolated</b> porcine hepatocytes could support stocking of cell-loaded bioreactors for BAL use and may provide bioreactors ready to be used at the patient's bedside. For {{the development of this}} technology, it is of utmost importance to ensure cell viability and differentiated functions after low-temperature storage and following warm reperfusion. We compared cell viability, functional activity and apoptosis in isolated porcine hepatocytes which were perfused within a radial-flow bioreactor (RFB), stored at 4 degrees C and then reperfused at 37 degrees C. RFBs were loaded with 8 x 10 (9), > or = 90 % viable hepatocytes at 37 degrees C for 3 h. RFBs were then flushed with 4 degrees C University of Wisconsin solution (UW) and subsequently stored for 24 h or 48 h. RFBs were then reperfused for 8 h with recirculating medium plus serum at 37 degrees C. Cytochrome P 450 (CYP) activity was studied before and after cold <b>storage</b> by means <b>of</b> monoethylglycinexylide (MEGX) detection in the effluent medium, after repeated lidocaine injections. After reperfusion experiments, hepatocytes were harvested for total RNA isolation. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used in order to amplify specific mRNAs for Bcl- 2 and Bax genes, by using appropriate primers; beta-actin primers were used as control. Total RNA was extracted by northern blotting analysis and for Bcl- 2, Bax and beta-actin RNA messenger detection, RT-PCR amplification was used. Freshly isolated hepatocytes perfused into the RFB showed a progressive increase of MEGX while a loss in Bax expression was paralleled by an increase in Bcl- 2 expression, in comparison to starting hepatocytes. After 4 degrees C storage and warm reperfusion, MEGX production was preserved in 24 h- and 48 h-stored bioreactors as well as a sharp increase of Bcl- 2 and a decrease of Bax mRNAs.

The growth on agar of the reisolated fungal cultures and the original fungal cultures was measured over 14 d. Seedlings of E. globulus were also inoculated with either the original fungal isolates or their reisolates and were grown in pots containing a P-deficient sand, in a temperature-controlled glasshouse.

The reisolates generally grew {{at a faster rate}} on agar, and colonized plant roots more quickly, than the original isolates. Plants inoculated with the reisolates also had increased dry weights by day 93, which could be attributed to increased P uptake by the plant.

But for hypothermic preservation of some other tissues and organs, when ionic pumps are inhibited, it is unnecessary to support metabolism, and beneficial control of ion and water distribution between intra- and extracellular compartments is achieved by storage in appropriately formulated 'intracellular-type' solutions. We have therefore designed a solution that will restrict ionic imbalances and minimise endothelial cell swelling in corneas during exposure at reduced temperatures. This potassium-rich solution contains the biological pH buffer TES as an impermeant anion and is designated CPTES (corneal-potassium-TES). The structural and functional integrity of rabbit corneas stored at 0 degrees C in CPTES, without the addition of colloid osmotic agents, is compared with that of corneas stored in glutathione bicarbonate Ringers' solution (GBR), an 'extracellular-type' medium formulated for the maintenance of endothelial integrity during in-vitro perfusion at 34 degrees C. Corneas swelled significantly less during storage in CPTES than in GBR and could be stored for five days before reaching the same degree of hydration as corneas stored for only three days in GBR. Gross structural integrity and endothelial ultrastructure were maintained during storage for three and five days in CPTES. The rate of thinning of corneas stored in CPTES was significantly greater than in comparable groups of corneas stored in GBR. However, the efficient dehydration of corneas stored in CPTES was always preceded during perfusion by a brief period of additional swelling which was shown to be an osmotic response during the elution of the buffer compound TES that had permeated the stroma during <b>storage.</b> The omission <b>of</b> calcium or the addition of adenosine and glutathione to the CPTES preservation medium had no detectable effect on the integrity of the endothelium, but the omission of bicarbonate was beneficial, producing significantly higher rates of stromal thinning during normothermic perfusion.

30|$|Geomyces spores and Mortierella plugs {{were used}} in this study. All inocula were {{collected}} from 2 -wk old 20 % PDA culture dishes at 10 [*]±[*] 1 °C. Spore suspensions (100  μL volume) or plugs were put into 0.5  mL microtubes and kept at − 20 [*]±[*] 1 °C. Samples were removed after 4 and 8 wk then kept {{at room temperature for}} 30  min to defrost. Each spore suspension was spread across a 20 % PDA Petri dish (9  cm diameter), which was then sealed and kept at 20 [*]±[*] 1 °C for 24  h, after which time spore germination was assessed under a light microscope (× 400 magnification). Spores were classified as germinated if the length of the germ tube was longer than the length of the spore. When possible, at least 200 spores were counted on each dish. For the defrosted plugs, one plug was put upside down in the centre of a 20 % PDA Petri dish (9  cm diameter), sealed and left at 20 [*]±[*] 1 °C for 1 wk, after which time radial growth was measured along two perpendicular axes, which intersected at the centre of the plug. Only plugs from 4 wk exposure were assessed. There were five samples (i.e., five frozen microtubes) per fungal isolate, at each time assessment, with each originating from a separate original culture dish. Running concurrently to the experiment spore suspensions of Geomyces and plugs of Mortierella were put into microtubes and left at 5 [*]±[*] 1 °C (the laboratory standard for <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> these <b>isolates)</b> and assessed for germination or radial growth as above.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. ExtraceUular <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> {{thyroglobulin}} (TG) is {{an important}} prerequisite for maintaining constant levels of thyroid hormones in vertebrates. <b>Storage</b> <b>of</b> large amounts is made possible by compactation of TG in the follicle lumen with concentrations of at least 100 - 400 mg/ml. We recently observed that the luminal content from bovine thyroids can be isolated in an intact state and be separated from soluble TG. For this purpose, bovine thyroid tissue was homogenized and subjected to various steps of purification. This procedure resulted in a pellet of single globules measuring 20 - 120 #m in diameter. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a unique cobblestone-like surface pattern <b>of</b> <b>isolated</b> globules, showing in detail the impressions of the apical plasma membranes of thyrocytes which ha...|$|R
40|$|Heart {{transplantation}} is, {{for certain}} types of cardiovascular disease, the only form of treatment resulting in patient survival. Its clinical application is, however, limited by the shortage of donor organs. This shortage {{is largely due to}} the inability to consistently preserve adequate myocardial function over prolonged ischemic periods. It is the goal of this research to provide information which may contribute to techniques for heart preservation, thus improving graft survival following preservation and transplantation. Current methods for myocardial preservation generally involve the arrest and immersion of the heart in cold cardioplegic solution, the composition of which is designed to provide for the reduced metabolic demands of the cold, arrested muscle. These methods have extended the preservation period to approximately 6 hours; however, hearts cannot be held longer than this period because, although metabolism has been slowed by hypothermia, alterations take place which compromise functional recovery upon reperfusion. A variety of perfusates and perfusion techniques have been developed to protect the myocardium from the damage thought to occur as a consequence <b>of</b> ischemic <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> the <b>isolated</b> heart. However, a consistently successful technique for long-term preservation of the heart remains undefined. A growing body of knowledge has led to the hypothesis that injury to the microcirculation may result in myocardial ischemia during preservation and decreased contractile function following preservation. To test this hypothesis, standard Langendorff techniques for the measurement of left ventricular function were combined with biochemical, histological and morphological techniques to determine: (1) whether loss of microvascular function occurs in isolated hearts hypothermically perfused with an oxygenated solution; (2) the impact of microvascular dysfunction during the preservation period on the functional recovery of hearts; and (3) which mechanisms contribute to decreased microvascular function during preservation. This experimental approach will allow for characterization {{of the role of the}} microvasculature in decreased contractility of preserved hearts and will provide information regarding the contribution of specific mechanisms to the compromised contractility of preserved hearts. Systematic evaluation of mechanisms thought to be responsible for decreased contractility <b>of</b> <b>isolated</b> hearts could contribute to improved myocardial preservation techniques that can be applied to clinical transplantation...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aims: Suspensions <b>of</b> <b>isolated</b> hepatocytes are a {{valuable}} tool to study liver functions, For optimal use <b>of</b> the <b>isolated</b> hepatocytes, methods are needed to preserve the hepatocytes while maintaining their viability, metabolic and transport functions, Until now little has been known about {{the maintenance of the}} drug metabolism capacity and energy state, measured by the so-called energy charge (ATP+ 1 / 2 ADP) /(ATP+ADP+AMP), in hepatocytes after <b>storage</b> in University <b>of</b> Wisconsin cold <b>storage</b> solution (UW), Consequently, we investigated whether UW, originally designed to preserve organs for transplantation, was suitable for preservation <b>of</b> <b>isolated</b> rat hepatocytes with respect to the maintenance of drug metabolism and levels of energy-rich substrates. Methods: Viability <b>of</b> the <b>isolated</b> rat hepatocytes was determined by trypan blue exclusion, ATP content and energy charge after 24 and 48 h <b>of</b> <b>storage</b> in UW at 0 degrees C, Phase I and II metabolic functions of the cells were studied by measuring the cytochrome P 450 content and the metabolic rate of lidocaine and 7 -ethoxycoumarin. Results: During 48 h <b>of</b> <b>storage</b> <b>of</b> hepatocytes in UW both phase I and phase II metabolism are preserved at control levels, After <b>storage,</b> the viability <b>of</b> the hepatocytes was not changed significantly, and the cells maintained proper cellular ATP content and overall energy charge. Conclusions: These results imply that hepatocytes from a single isolation can be stored in UW solution and used for metabolism experiments for 3 consecutive days, allowing a reduction in the use of experimental animals...|$|R
