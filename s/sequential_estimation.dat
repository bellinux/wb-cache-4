This <b>sequential</b> <b>estimation</b> method is designed {{based on the principle}} of recursive soft-in/soft-out (SISO) decoding, and we refer to it as the recursive soft <b>sequential</b> <b>estimation</b> (RSSE) acquisition scheme. The RSSE acquisition scheme exhibits a complexity similar to that of a conventional-sequence generator, which increases only linearly with the number of stages in the -sequence generator. Our simulation results also show that the acquisition time of the proposed RSSE acquisition scheme is also linearly dependent on the number of stages in the -sequence generator. Owing to the above properties, the employment of the proposed RSSE acquisition scheme is beneficial for the acquisition of long -sequences.

This <b>sequential</b> <b>estimation</b> method exploits the principle of iterative soft-in–soft-out (SISO) decoding for enhancing the acquisition performance, and that of differential preprocessing {{for the sake of}} achieving an enhanced acquisition performance, when communicating over various communication environments.

The DRSSE acquisition scheme exhibits a low complexity, which is similar to that of an-sequence generator, while achieving an acquisition time that is linearly dependent on the number of stages in the-sequence generator. A low acquisition time is achieved with the advent of the property that the proposed DRSSE scheme is capable of determining the real-time reliabilities associated with the decision concerning a set of, say, consecutive chips. This set of consecutive chips constitutes the sufficient initial condition for enabling the local-sequence generator to produce a synchronized local despreading-sequence replica. Owing to these attractive characteristics, the DRSSE acquisition scheme constitutes a promising initial synchronization scheme for acquisition of long-sequences, when communicating over various propagation environments.
