40|$|Researchers {{have studied}} oil spills in open waters using remote sensors, but few {{have focused on}} extracting {{reflectance}} features of oil pollution on sea ice. An experiment was conducted on natural sea ice in Bohai Bay, China, to obtain the spectral reflectance of oil-contaminated sea ice. The <b>spectral</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>index</b> (SAI), spectral peak height (SPH), and wavelet detail coefficient (DWT d 5) were calculated using stepwise multiple linear regression. The reflectances of some false targets were measured and analysed. The simulated false targets were sediment, iron ore fines, coal dust, and the melt pool. The measured reflectances were resampled using five common sensors (GF- 2, Landsat 8 -OLI, Sentinel 3 -OLCI, MODIS, and AVIRIS). Some significant spectral features could discriminate between oil-polluted and clean sea ice. The indices correlated well with the oil area fractions. All of the adjusted R 2 values exceeded 0. 9. The SPH model 1, based on spectral features at 507 – 670 and 1627 – 1746 nm, displayed the best fitting. The resampled data indicated that these multi-spectral and hyper-spectral sensors {{could be used to}} detect crude oil on the sea ice if the effect of noise and spatial resolution are neglected. The spectral features and their identified changes may provide reference on sensor design and band selection...|$|E
40|$|Using HyMap data, mineral {{identification}} and mineral mapping {{were conducted on}} the basis of the <b>spectral</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>index</b> (SAI) and other spectral absorption features in a study area in Tudun, eastern Tien Shan. Alteration minerals, such as calcite, alumina-rich (Al-rich) muscovite, epidote, and antigorite, were explored, and their relative abundance was depicted. A cross-validation was performed, and it showed a high degree of consistency between the imagery results and the results of previous literature. To further validate the mineral mapping from HyMap data, a field survey was carried out and rock samples were collected for quantitative analysis using a Por Infrared Mineral Analyzer (PIMA) and the software affiliated with it. Minerals were discriminated, and their relative abundance was calculated from the spectra. Although we found that the absorption band-depth and SAI agreed well with each other and with the relative abundance of mineral alterations, the spectral absorption band-depth provided a better representation. Finally, ore prospecting of the study area was presented, and we found the distribution and close spatial relationships among the minerals extracted using the HyMap data. In the northern and northwestern part of the Gold-mine area, there was a mineralized muscovite alteration showing a sheet or block distribution. In the Copper-mine area, Al-poor muscovite with a sheet distribution was distributed in the north and northeast region, and Al-rich muscovite showed a block distribution enclosed by the distribution area of Al-poor muscovite. These all showed good ore prospects for the study area...|$|E

40|$|Using {{evolutionary}} population synthesis {{we present}} integrated colours, integrated spectral energy distributions and absorption-line indices {{defined by the}} Lick Observatory image dissector scanner (referred to as Lick/IDS) system, for an extensive set of instantaneous burst binary stellar populations with and without binary interactions. The ages of the populations {{are in the range}} 1 − 15 Gyr and the metallicities are in the range 0. 0001 − 0. 03. By comparing the results for populations with and without binary interactions we show that the inclusion of binary interactions makes the integrated U − B, B − V, V − R and R − I colours and all Lick/IDS <b>spectral</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>indices</b> (except for Hβ) substantially smaller. In other words binary evolution makes a population appear bluer. This effect raises the derived age and metallicity of the population. We calculate several sets of additional solar-metallicity binary stellar populations to explore the influence of input parameters to the binary evolution algorithm (the common-envelope ejection efficiency and the stellar wind mass-loss rate) on the resulting integrated colours. We also look at the dependence on the choice of distribution functions used to generate the initial binary population. The results show that variations in the choice of input model parameters and distributions can significantly affect the results. However, comparing the discrepancies that exist between the colours of various models, we find that the differences are less than those produced between the models with and those without binary interactions. Therefore it is very necessary to consider binary interactions in order to draw accurate conclusions from evolutionary population synthesis work...|$|R
40|$|We use the C_ 24668, Fe 4383, Hγ_A and Hδ_A <b>spectral</b> <b>absorption</b> line <b>indices,</b> {{together}} with U- and V-band photometry of 101 {{galaxies in the}} Coma cluster, to investigate how mean age and metal abundance correlate with galaxy luminosity. In particular, we use the line index measurements to address {{the origin of the}} colour-magnitude relation (CMR). We find that the CMR in Coma is driven primarily by a luminosity-metallicity correlation. We additionally show evidence for a relation between age and luminosity, in the direction predicted by the semi-analytic hierarchical clustering models of Kauffmann & Charlot, but this is only present in the C_ 24668 index models, and could be an effect of the lack of non solar abundance ratios in the Worthey models used. By comparing deviations from the CMR, with deviations in <b>absorption</b> <b>index</b> from analogous `index-magnitude' relations, we find that colour deviations bluewards of the mean relation are strongly correlated with the hydrogen Balmer line series absorption. We show that the properties of these blue galaxies are consistent with the presence of a young stellar population in the galaxies, rather than with a reduced metallicity. Comment: 9 pages, 5 figures.

40|$|The {{spectral}} analysis method was applied experimentally {{to extract the}} spectral indices, measure and analyze the spectral characteristics and their difference of the mixture which are composed in soil in Central Shaanxi Plain and the diesel and motor oil respectively, aiming to provide solutions to practical difficulties in detecting, analyzing the spectral characteristics and difference between the soil leaking with equal content diesel and motor oil and predicting the leaking content of diesel in the soil. The spectral response curves of the soil leaking with different oil respectively and the soil leaking with diesel with different content were collected. Then the spectral prediction model for the leaking content of diesel in the soil was built based on the reflectance characteristics. The coefficient of the detection (R- 2) was introduced to evaluate {{the stability of the}} built model, and the parameter root mean squared error (RMSE) was introduced to estimate the precision and the predictability of the model built in this work. It is demonstrated that : (1) The reflectance of soil leaking with diesel is less than that of the equal content motor oil. And there is a double absorption trough of the reflectance curve of both soil leaking with diesel and motor oil at 1 740 and 2 328 nm. The <b>spectral</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>indices</b> and <b>absorption</b> depth of the soil leaking with diesel keep less than the equal content motor oil. (2) The built spectral prediction model for the leaking content of diesel in the soil demonstrates good stability with the coefficient of determination at R- 2 = 0. 854, and performs favorable predictability (Root-Mean-Square Error, RMSE= 0. 016), which can benefit the effective prediction and quick estimation methods of the leaking content of diesel in the soil, enrich and progress the experimental method and theoretical research work of spectral prediction on soil leaking oil content and promote the application of remote sensing in safety production and environmental protection...|$|R
40|$|Using EPS {{we present}} high {{resolution}} (0. 3 Å, HRes) ISEDs from 3000 to 7000 Å and Lick/IDS absorption-line indices, for an extensive set of instantaneous burst binary stellar populations (BSPs) with binary interactions. The {{ages of the}} BSPs {{are in the range}} 1 - 15 Gyr and the metallicities are in the range 0. 004 - 0. 03. This HRes synthesis results can satisfy the needs of modern spectroscopic galaxy surveys, and are available on request. By comparing the synthetic continuum of BSPs at high and low resolution (LRes) we show that there is a good agreement for Z= 0. 02 and a tolerable disagreement for non-solar metallicity. The strength of the Balmer lines at HRes is greater than that at LRes for all metallicities. The comparison of Lick/IDS absorption-line indices at LRes and HRes, both of which are obtained by the fitting functions (FFs), shows that the discrepancies in all indices except for TiO_ 1 and TiO_ 2 are insignificant for BSPs with Z= 0. 004 and Z= 0. 02. The HRes Ca 4227, Fe 5015 and Mg_b indices are redder than the corresponding LRes one for BSPs with Z= 0. 01 and Z= 0. 03, this effect lowers the derived age and metallicity of the BSP. The high resolution Mg_ 1, Fe 5709 and Fe 5782 indices are bluer than those at LRes, it raises the age and metallicity. The discrepancy in these six indices is greater for BSPs with Z= 0. 03 in comparison to Z= 0. 01. At HRes we compare the Lick/IDS <b>spectral</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>indices</b> obtained by using the FFs with those measured directly from the synthetic spectra, and see that Ca 4455, Fe 4668, Mg_b and Na D indices obtained by the use of the FFs are redder for all metallicities, Fe 5709 is redder at Z= 0. 03 and becomes to be bluer at Z= 0. 01 and 0. 004, and other indices are bluer for all metallicities than the corresponding values measured directly from the synthetic spectra.

40|$|Integrated spectra {{have been}} {{obtained}} of 31 star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds (MC) and of 4 Galactic globular clusters. The spectra cover the wavelength range 3500 [...] 4700 Angstroms at a resolution of 3. 2 Angstroms FWHM. The MC clusters primarily cover the age range < 10 ^ 8 [...] 3 Gyr, and hence are well-suited to an empirical study of aging post-starburst stellar populations. An age-dating method is presented that relies on two <b>spectral</b> <b>absorption</b> feature <b>indices,</b> Hdelta/Fe I 4045 and Ca II, {{as well as an}} index measuring the strength of the Balmer discontinuity. We compare the behavior of the spectral indices in the observed integrated spectra of the MC clusters to that of indices generated from theoretical evolutionary synthesis models of varying age and metal-abundance. The synthesis models are based on those of Worthey (1994, ApJS, 95, 107), when coupled with the combination of an empirical library of stellar spectra (Jones 1999, PhD thesis, University of North Carolina) for the cooler stars and synthetic spectra, generated from Kurucz model atmospheres, for the hotters stars. Overall, we find good agreement between the ages of the MC clusters derived from our integrated spectra (and the evolutionary synthesis modelling of the spectral indices) and ages derived from analyses of the cluster color-magnitude diagrams, as found in the literature. Hence the principal conclusion {{of this study is that}} ages of young stellar populations can be reliably measured from modelling of their integrated spectra...|$|R
