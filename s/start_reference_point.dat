The conference in which this paper was delivered consisted of the worlds leading holographic experts – scientists, engineers and artists, interested in advancing the technology. This formed the ideal platform to gather crucial information regarding the future of holography and significantly – Its future - illustrated {{in the form of}} three-dimensional mind maps. This paper combined a question and answer section which asked questions such as ‘What current application of holography are you working on?’ and ‘When do you predict it will become available within design practice?” The aim was to develop my argument that future design processes will need methods of three-dimensional print requiring timeliness of response, flexibility, access to information and fully rendered digital holograms on demand especially for digital holography. These characteristics imply a more geographically distributed and collaborative kind of information dissemination activity than is commonplace today as a complex network of 3 D CAD designers are already in place and primed for holographic exploitation.

50|$|The {{topic of}} astrological {{geography}} is the astrological {{study of the}} lands, the features, the inhabitants, and the phenomena of the Earth.The origins of astrogeography may possibly {{go back to the}} roots of astrology in Mesopotamian Culture. Some relation between zodiac signs and cardinal points is highly probable to have been established for astrological weather forecasts and other purposes of prediction. Nicholas Campion names Marcus Manilius (1st century) and Claudius Ptolemaeus (2nd century) to be the first authors to deliver a system of rulership of zodiac signs for regions. Others are Al-Biruni (11th century), William Lilly (17th century), Raphael (19th century), Green and Sepharial (20th century). An important systematic approach to astrogeography was developed by various astrologers such as Sepharial (Walter Gorn Old) in England, and A.M. Grimm in Germany. Both these systems assume that the Greenwich Meridian in metropolitan London has a 0° Aries fixed local MC, leaving the various regions of the globe to correspond with the 12 signs of the zodiac. There are subtle differences between the system of Sepharial and Grimm which are not noticeable in many classical astrology methods, but may be noticeable in precision methods such as those of Uranian astrology or cosmobiology. The Sepharial system was later popularized by Canadian astrologer Chris McRae, and American astrologer Joyce Wehrman. The Canadian astrologer L. Edward Johndro also worked with this method at various points throughout the 1930s and later years, and vacillated between the <b>starting</b> <b>reference</b> <b>point</b> at Greenwich and one near the greater pyramids of Egypt; there is controversy over which system he actually decided upon in later years. In the course of the development of computer technology which made it easier to calculate more elaborate astrogeographical maps the so-called Andersen system was published in 1974. It included 11 newly developed world maps valid for one planet each. A more complex astrogeographical world mapping system based on the holographic structural model and astrological field study through comparison of the features of the landscape developed in astrological geomancy was published by Georg Stockhorst in 2009 calculating 6 size levels of fields nested inside one another.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a robust photogrammetric system for 3 -D surface reconstruction. We use a linear camera calibration model with 14 camera parameters, {{which can be}} optimized using the least-squares solution. To address the non-linear lens distortion, a localized calibration concept is presented whereby different image locations have different sets of calibration parameters. A new subpixel target detection algorithm is proposed for accurate target center determination (with accuracy better than 0. 02 pixel). The algorithm first uses zero-crossings of the second derivatives to determine an initial threshold for separating a target from its background. Then multiple threshold functions are selected to calculate multiple potential target centers. The weighted average of these potential centers results in a reliable final target position. Comparing with other subpixel algorithms, such as best-fit circle/ellipse, template matching based approach or single threshold gravity point method, our algorithm is more accurate and {{can be applied to}} any shapes of targets. To minimize the possibility of mismatch of targets among different views, we adopt a new <b>reference</b> <b>point</b> based matching approach.

The geolocation data, together with a 30 -m digital elevation model, were used to generate Input Geometry (IGM) files for georeferencing the imagery. The RTGC reflectance images were georeferenced using the vendor-supplied IGM files. Upon examination, however, the georeferenced images were distorted by up to seven pixels (∼ 30 m). The IGM solution files were unable to rectify even larger, systematic distortions in the underlying imagery delivered by ESSI. Therefore, we “rubber-sheeted” the IGM output images to a 1 −m resolution digital orthophoto mosaic produced in ERDAS Imagine (version 8.7), from digital orthophoto quads downloaded from the California Spatial Information Library ([URL] Rubber-sheeting requires a dense, systematic grid of image tie points, which were obtained using an automated, area-based correlation algorithm (Kennedy and Cohen 2003). The program allows the user to specify the size and spacing of the image analysis window, define multiple levels of pixel aggregation, and set scale factors to zoom in and more precisely designate tie points. After manually defining a single image tie point in each flight line to provide the program with a <b>starting</b> <b>reference</b> <b>point,</b> the program generated the rest in a systematic grid across the image. The same parameters were used to produce 810 tie points for the Simi fire image strip, and between 323 and 647 points for the five Old fire image strips, with the number varying {{as a function of}} the length of the flight line. The output ASCII files contain the X and Y coordinates of the tie points from the input and reference images, which can be imported directly into the ERDAS Imagine georectification utility for rubber-sheeting. Each image strip was resampled to a 4 m resolution using cubic convolution resampling. The five rectified images at the Old fire were then merged using nearest-neighbor resampling with the mosaic tool in Imagine. Finally, the geolocation accuracy of the rectified Simi fire flight line and Old fire mosaic was verified using approximately a dozen differentially corrected GPS points collected in the field at the middle-of-road intersections near our field sites. All of these GPS points were centered within the width of the road or road intersection (within 2 pixels, or 8 m), when displayed over the rectified imagery. Thus, we are confident that the preprocessing steps produced the radiometrically and geometrically rectified hyperspectral imagery needed for this analysis.|$|R

Fisheries-induced evolution is one mechanism that can alter population characteristics, leading to "shifting" <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> by modifying the underlying biological processes or {{by changing the}} perception of a fishery system. The former causes changes in "true" <b>reference</b> <b>points,</b> whereas the latter is caused by changes in the yardsticks used to quantify a system's status. Unaccounted shifts of either kind imply that <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> gradually lose their intended meaning. This can lead to increased precaution, which is safe, but potentially costly. Shifts can also occur in more perilous directions, such that actual risks are greater than anticipated. Our qualitative analysis suggests that all commonly used <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> are susceptible to shifting through fisheries-induced evolution, including the limit and "precautionary" <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> for spawning-stock biomass, B and B, and the target <b>reference</b> <b>point</b> for fishing mortality, F. Our findings call for increased awareness of fisheries-induced changes and highlight the value of always basing <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> on adequately updated information, to capture all changes in the biological processes that drive fish population dynamics...|$|R
