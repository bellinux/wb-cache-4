40|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} functions of a financial system is intermediation: channeling the aggregate savings of an economy toward productive use. 1 In the absence of intermediators, individuals, firms, and governments in need of finance and savers with surplus funds seeking investment opportunities {{would have to find}} each other and negotiate detailed contracts. These contracts would have to <b>specify</b> whether <b>the</b> <b>funds</b> are be loaned or to purchase a share of the enterprise. If loaned, the contract must stipulate the term and interest rate of the loan, as well as the amount and quality of collateral to be pledged as security. If <b>the</b> <b>funds</b> purchase an ownership share, the contract must stipulate the fraction of the profits and seats {{on the board of directors}} the new investor will be entitled to and, if the enterprise fails, how much liability will the shareholder bear.

40|$|In {{an earlier}} paper we {{analyzed}} {{a method of}} combining traditional tax financed pay-as-you-go Social Security benefits with annuities financed by Personal Retirement Accounts. We showed that such a combination could maintain the level of retirement income projected in current Social Security law while avoiding a future increase in the payroll tax rate. The current paper extends the earlier analysis in four ways: (1) We now <b>specify</b> that <b>the</b> <b>funds</b> deposited in <b>the</b> Personal Retirement Accounts come from allocating 2 percent of the 12. 4 percent payroll tax instead of being additional funds provided from outside the system. (2) We discuss {{the effects of the}} uncertain return on investment based annuities. (3) We provide estimates of the cost of permitting bequests if individuals die either before retirement or during the first twenty years after retirement. (4) We update the statistical basis for our estimates to be consistent with the 2000 Social Security Trustees Report. Our analysis shows that a program of Personal Retirement Accounts funded by allocating 2 percent of the 12. 4 percent payroll tax collections can maintain the retirement income projected in current law while avoiding any increase in the 12. 4 percent payroll tax. The combination of the higher return on the assets in the Personal Retirement Accounts {{and the use of the}} additional corporate profits taxes that result from the increased national saving in Personal Retirement Accounts is sufficient to maintain the solvency of the Social Security Trust <b>Fund</b> even though <b>the</b> tax payments to <b>the</b> <b>fund</b> are reduced from 12. 4 percent of taxable payroll to 10. 4 percent of taxable payroll. Although there is a period of years when <b>the</b> Trust <b>Fund</b> must borrow, it is able to repay this borrowing with interest out of future tax collections. In the long run, <b>the</b> Trust <b>Fund</b> becomes very large, implying that it would be possible to reduce the payroll tax further or to increase retirement incomes above the levels projected in current law. ...|$|R
