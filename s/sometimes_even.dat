5|$|At the lek, {{males have}} been {{observed}} to break up into pairs, performing “confrontation displays”. This consists of facing each other while bowing, jumping, and flapping their wings, <b>sometimes</b> <b>even</b> snapping their bills, {{and at the same}} time giving off various squawking and grunting calls. When the female approaches, it becomes even more intense. The display turns into a cacophony of bright color and a frenzied activity filling the air with very strange sounds.|$|E
5|$|Cirrus forms from {{tropical}} cyclones, and {{is commonly}} seen fanning {{out from the}} eyewalls of hurricanes. A large shield of cirrus and cirrostratus typically accompanies the high altitude outflow of hurricanes or typhoons, and these can make the underlying rain bands—and <b>sometimes</b> <b>even</b> the eye—difficult to detect in satellite photographs.|$|E
5|$|Isolated vacancy is {{the most}} studied defect in diamond, both {{experimentally}} and theoretically. Its most important practical property is optical absorption, like in the color centers, which gives diamond green, or <b>sometimes</b> <b>even</b> green–blue color (in pure diamond). The characteristic feature of this absorption {{is a series of}} sharp lines called GR1-8, where GR1 line at 741nm {{is the most}} prominent and important.|$|E

5|$|The Cuban iguana {{makes its}} burrow near cacti or thistles, <b>sometimes</b> <b>even</b> within the cactus itself. These thorny plants offer {{protection}} and their fruit and flowers offer the iguanas food. In areas without cacti, the lizards make their burrows in dead trees, hollow logs, and limestone crevices.|$|E
5|$|The {{everyday}} interpenetration of the {{two languages}} is indicated by bilingual inscriptions, which <b>sometimes</b> <b>even</b> switch {{back and forth between}} Greek and Latin. The epitaph of a Greek-speaking soldier, for instance, might be written primarily in Greek, with his rank and unit in the Roman army expressed in Latin.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{turbulent}} political, social and musical {{changes of the}} 1960s and early 1970s, rock music diversified. What was formerly known as rock and roll, a reasonably discrete style of music, had evolved into a catchall category called simply rock music, an umbrella term which would eventually include diverse styles like heavy metal music, punk rock and, <b>sometimes</b> <b>even</b> hip hop music. During the 1970s, however, most of these styles {{were not part of}} mainstream music, and were evolving in the underground music scene.|$|E

5|$|Most {{methods that}} {{separate}} neptunium ions exploit the differing chemical behaviour of the differing oxidation states of neptunium (from +3 to +6 or <b>sometimes</b> <b>even</b> +7) in solution. Among the methods that are {{or have been}} used are: solvent extraction (using various extractants, usually multidentate β-diketone derivatives, organophosphorus compounds, and amine compounds), chromatography using various ion-exchange or chelating resins, coprecipitation (possible matrices include LaF3, BiPO4, BaSO4, Fe(OH)3, and MnO2), electrodeposition, and biotechnological methods. Currently, commercial reprocessing plants use the Purex process, involving the solvent extraction of uranium and plutonium with tributyl phosphate.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{urticaria}} (SU) {{is a rare}} {{condition in}} which exposure to ultraviolet or UV radiation, or <b>sometimes</b> <b>even</b> visible light, induces a case of urticaria or hives that can appear in both covered and uncovered areas of the skin. It is classified {{as a type of}} physical urticaria. The classification of disease types is somewhat controversial. One classification system distinguished various types of SU based on the wavelength of the radiation that causes the breakout; another classification system is based on the type of allergen that initiates a breakout.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} {{crested newt}} {{is the most}} widespread species, while the others are confined to smaller regions, e.g. the southwestern Iberian Peninsula in the southern marbled newt, and the Danube basin {{and some of its}} tributaries in the Danube crested newt. The Italian crested newt (T. carnifex) has been introduced outside its native range in some European countries and the Azores. In the northern Balkans, four species of crested newt occur in close vicinity, and may <b>sometimes</b> <b>even</b> co-exist.|$|E

5|$|To prepare {{these forces}} the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (German High Command) {{increased}} the call-up age range and recruited from Eastern European countries controlled by German forces, increasing manpower on the Western Front from roughly 400,000 {{to just over}} 1 million soldiers. Hastily organized into new divisions, these infantrymen lacked training and <b>sometimes</b> <b>even</b> weapons. Despite an immense German effort {{in the face of}} intense Allied bombing to build the necessary stocks for the offensive, there were shortages of fuel, ammunition, weapons and manpower by the scheduled date of the counterattack. Even the elite Waffen-SS divisions were often deficient in manpower.|$|E
5|$|Vaikuntha Chaturmurti or Vaikuntha Vishnu is a four-headed {{aspect of}} the Hindu god Vishnu, mostly found in Kashmir (northern part of the Indian subcontinent). The icon {{represents}} Vishnu as the Supreme Being. He has a human head, a lion head, a boar head and a demonic head. <b>Sometimes,</b> <b>even</b> three-headed aspects of Vishnu where the demonic rear head is dropped are considered to represent Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. Though iconographical treatises describe him to eight-armed, he is often depicted with four. Generally, Vaikuntha Chaturmurti is shown standing but sometimes he is depicted seated on his vahana (mount) Garuda.|$|E
5|$|When the Council did review cases, {{the reviews}} were {{commonly}} {{dominated by the}} countries whose ethnic groups were affected and that tried not only to resolve the problem of mistreatment of their minorities but also score other political goals on the international scene, <b>sometimes</b> <b>even</b> sacrificing the very minority in question (German and Hungarian governments are recognized as having abused the system the most). Also, of course, the League, lacking its own army, could not coerce any state to adhere to its recommendations.|$|E

5|$|A {{new method}} to study lipid bilayers is Atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM). Rather than using {{a beam of}} light or particles, a very small sharpened tip scans the surface by making physical contact with the bilayer and moving across it, like a record player needle. AFM is a promising technique because {{it has the potential to}} image with nanometer resolution at room temperature and even under water or physiological buffer, conditions necessary for natural bilayer behavior. Utilizing this capability, AFM has been used to examine dynamic bilayer behavior including the formation of transmembrane pores (holes) and phase transitions in supported bilayers. Another advantage is that AFM does not require fluorescent or isotopic labeling of the lipids, since the probe tip interacts mechanically with the bilayer surface. Because of this, the same scan can image both lipids and associated proteins, <b>sometimes</b> <b>even</b> with single-molecule resolution. AFM can also probe the mechanical nature of lipid bilayers.|$|E
5|$|After {{being away}} {{for nearly four}} months, Michaels would make a {{surprise}} return to the WWF as a guest commentator on the July 13 episode of Raw Is War. Michaels would continue to make non-wrestling appearances on WWF programming and on November 23 he replaced Sgt. Slaughter as the WWF Commissioner, a portrayed match maker and rules enforcer, eventually joining Vince McMahon's group of wrestlers called The Corporation as a villain. Throughout late 1998 and early 1999, Michaels made regular television appearances on Raw, in which he scheduled matches, throwing around his authority, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>even</b> deciding the outcome of matches. On the January 4, 1999 episode of Raw Is War, Michaels re-joined DX as a fan favorite, but disappeared from WWF television {{for a few weeks}} to have back surgery {{and by the time he}} returned DX was on the way of dissolving within the next couple of months.|$|E
5|$|Balzac's {{work habits}} are legendary, he wrote from 1 am to 8 am {{every night and}} <b>sometimes</b> <b>even</b> longer. Balzac could write very rapidly; some of his novels, written with a quill, were {{composed}} at a pace equal to thirty words per minute on a modern typewriter. His preferred method was to eat a light meal at five or six in the afternoon, then sleep until midnight. He then rose and wrote for many hours, fueled by innumerable cups of black coffee. He would often work for fifteen hours or more at a stretch; {{he claimed to have}} once worked for 48 hours with only three hours of rest in the middle.|$|E
