40|$|AIM: To analyze inter-vendor {{differences}} of speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) in imaging cardiac deformation {{in patients with}} dyssynchronous heart failure. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eleven patients (all with LBBB, median age 60. 7 years, 9 males) with implanted cardiac resynchronization therapy devices were prospectively included. Ultrasound systems of two vendors (i. e. General Electric and Philips) were used to record images in the apical four chamber view. Regional longitudinal <b>strain</b> <b>patterns</b> were analyzed with vendor specific software in the basal, mid and apical septal segments. Systolic strain (SS), time to peak strain (TTP) and septal rebound stretch (SRS) were determined during four pacing settings, resulting in 44 unique <b>strain</b> <b>patterns</b> per segment (total 132 patterns). Cross correlation was {{used to analyze the}} comparability of the shape of 132 normalized <b>strain</b> <b>patterns.</b> Correlation of <b>strain</b> <b>patterns</b> of the two systems was high (R(2) median: 0. 68, interquartile range: 0. 53 - 0. 82). Accordingly, <b>strain</b> <b>patterns</b> of intrinsic rhythm were recognized equally using both systems, when divided into three types. GE based SS (18. 9 ± 4. 7 %) was significantly higher than SS determined by the Philips system (13. 4 ± 4. 3 %). TTP was slightly but non-significantly lower in GE (384 ± 77 ms) compared to Philips (404 ± 83 ms) derived strain signals. Correlation of SRS between the systems was poor, due to minor differences in the strain signal and timing of aortic valve closure. CONCLUSIONS: The two systems provide similar shape of <b>strain</b> <b>patterns.</b> However, important differences are found in the amplitude, timing of systole and SRS. Until STE is standardized, clinical decision making should be restricted to pattern analysis...|$|R

5000|$|Cranial sutures are {{indicators}} of skull function and morphologies {{can be linked}} to specific feeding modes. Transitional feeding changes can be observed by examining cross sectional morphology of a suture in taxa of the fish-tetrapod transition. [...] Comparing positionally comparable sutures in extant fish allows {{for the creation of a}} sutural morphospace. The main cause of sutural deformation is caused by strain during feeding activity, most prominent with feeding mechanisms involving sucking a prey into the mouth. There is a tension anteriorly, and compression posteriorly strain patterns are observed in Polypterus, a prey-sucking predator. In terrestrial tetrapod Phonerpeton, there is compression between the frontals and parietals and a complex loading between the post parietals. There is no evidence of tensile strain in any sutures. Acanthostega fossil records demonstrate that no <b>strain</b> <b>pattern</b> was exhibited that relate to prey capture by means of suction. The load compression is similar to extant tetrapods. It is most likely that the organism captured prey by biting in the water or near the edge of the water. This finding indicates that the terrestrial mode of feeding first emerged in an aquatic environment.|$|E

40|$|The {{complete}} stress–strain {{characteristics of}} sandstone specimens were investigated {{in a series}} of quasi-static monotonic uniaxial compression tests. <b>Strain</b> <b>patterns</b> development during pre- and post-peak behaviours in specimens with different aspect ratios was also examined. Peak stress, post-peak portion of stress–strain, brittleness, characteristics of progressive localisation and field <b>strain</b> <b>patterns</b> development were affected at different extents by specimen aspect ratio. <b>Strain</b> <b>patterns</b> of the rocks were obtained by applying three-dimensional (3 D) digital image correlation (DIC) technique. Unlike conventional strain measurement using strain gauges attached to specimen, 3 D DIC allowed not only measuring large strains, but more importantly, mapping the development of field strain throughout the compression test, i. e. in pre- and post-peak regimes. Field strain development in the surface of rock specimen suggests that strain starts localising progressively and develops at a lower rate in pre-peak regime. However, in post-peak regime, strains increase at different rates as local deformations take place at different extents in the vicinity and outside the localised zone. The extent of localised strains together with the rate of strain localisation is associated with the increase in rate of strength degradation. Strain localisation and local inelastic unloading outside the localised zone both feature post-peak regime...|$|R

We attempted to estimate myocardial strain from cine cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) images by using a b-spline deformable image registration method. 3 healthy volunteers and 41 patients with either recent or chronic myocardial infarction (MI) were studied at 1. 5 Tesla with both cine and DENSE CMR. Regional circumferential and radial left ventricular strains were estimated from cine and DENSE acquisitions. In all healthy volunteers, {{there was no difference}} for peak circumferential strain (- 0. 18 ± 0. 04 vs. - 0. 18 ± 0. 03, p= 0. 76) between cine and DENSE CMR, however peak radial strain was overestimated from cine (0. 84 ± 0. 37 vs. 0. 49 ± 0. 2, p&# 60; 0. 01). In the patient study, the peak <b>strain</b> <b>patterns</b> predicted by cine were similar to the patterns from DENSE, including the strain evolution related to recovery time and <b>strain</b> <b>patterns</b> related to MI scar extent.

With ER of 0 − 30 °, 89 % of trials of superior subscapularis tendon and 100 % of trials of inferior subscapularis tendon achieved strains > 3 %, with very similar patterns noted in ER+ 30. In abduction of 0 − 90 °, 5. 8 % of trials of superior and 85. 3 % of trials of inferior tendon achieved > 3 % strain.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to clarify the {{functional}} and biomechanical relationship between jaw morphology and in vivo masticatory loading in selenodont artiodactyls. We compare in vivo strains from the mandibular corpus of goats and alpacas to predicted <b>strain</b> <b>patterns</b> derived from biomechanical models for mandibular corpus loading during mastication. Peak shear strains in both species average 600 – 700 µε on the working side and approximately 450 µε on the balancing side. Maximum principal tension in goats and alpacas is directed at approximately 30 ° dorsocaudally relative to the long axis of the corpus on the working side and approximately perpendicular to the long axis on the balancing side. <b>Strain</b> <b>patterns</b> in both species indicate primarily torsion of the working-side corpus about the long axis and parasagittal bending and/or lateral transverse bending of the balancing-side corpus. Interpretation of the <b>strain</b> <b>patterns</b> is consistent with comparative biomechanical analyses of jaw morphology suggesting that in goats, the balancing-side mandibular corpus is parasagittally bent whereas in alpacas it experiences lateral transverse bending. However, in light of higher working-side corpus strains, biomechanical explanations of mandibular form also need to consider that torsion influences relative corpus size and shape. Furthermore, the complex combination of loads that occur along the selenodont artiodactyl mandibular corpus during the power stroke has two implications.

40|$|Research on video-based face {{recognition}} has started getting increased {{attention in the}} past few years. Algorithms developed for video have an advantage from the availability of plentitude of frames in videos to extract information from. Despite this fact, most research in this direction has limited the scope of the problem to the application of still image-based approaches to some selected frames on which 2 D algorithms are expected to perform well. It can be realized that such an approach only uses the spatial information contained in video and does not incorporate the temporal structure. Only recently has the intelligence community begun to approach the problem in this direction. Video-based {{face recognition}} algorithms {{in the last couple of}} years attempt to simultaneously use the spatial and temporal information for the recognition of moving faces. A new face recognition method that falls into the category of algorithms that adopt spatio-temporal representation and utilizes dynamic information extracted from video is presented.
