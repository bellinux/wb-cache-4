This paper posits that jurisdictional remit potentially go beyond guiding the Botswana Ombudsman from <b>straying</b> into <b>areas</b> not anticipated to rendering even the statutory powers meaningless. This paper recommends that Botswana needs to take steps to revisit the powers and spheres of ouster of jurisdiction of the Ombudsman and make necessary statutory alignments to create a solid foundation that will ensure increased public confidence and operational effectiveness...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the titers of neutralising antibodies against rabies virus in five hundred vaccinated owned and stray dogs within the Istanbul province. The levels of the neutralising antibody titration in the blood serum were evaluated by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method. Sixty five (13 %) of the dogs examined had adequate level (0. 5 IU/ml and over) of antibody titration. Also, the effects on the formation of the neutralising antibody levels following the vaccination of some factors, such as being owned or stray, the number of repetition of vaccination, the age, living area, sex, interval between the last vaccination and sampling, have been evaluated statistically. As a result of the statistical evaluations, it has been determined that interval between the last vaccination and sampling had an important effect on formation of the neutralising antibody titration (P< 0. 001). Also, it was determined that the effect of the age of the dog was also significant for the neutralising antibody levels (P< 0. 05).

Hatchery supplementation programs, {{such as the one}} being used in the Yakima River, WA, create an ideal system in which to study the tradeoffs between homing and habitat. Hatchery-origin fish are reared in acclimation facilities that are intended to extend the spatial distribution of spawning and increase natural production.

Extensive surveys of channel morphology and physical habitat were conducted in over 160 km of mainstem, floodplain, and tributary river habitat in 2007. Preliminary results suggest that acclimation areas differ significantly in habitat characteristics across spatial scales (250 m, 1 km, 8 km, and 15 km). Hatchery-origin females select spawning sites that are away from acclimation areas and are characterized by deep, upstream habitat types.

If it is true that paediatricians are deterred for fear of putting themselves in jeopardy when giving evidence in court, this is a myth perpetuated by the RCPCH who remain in denial of what the General Medical Council censures were all about. The case against Professor Meadow was not just that he got his sums wrong on one occasion due to a misunderstanding of the CESDI (Confidential Enquiry into Stillbirth and Death in Infancy) Report. It was also about the duty of an expert to be independent of the side that called him; to be impartial, objective and competent; above all to be balanced and fair and not to <b>stray</b> into <b>areas</b> where he has no expertise; not to opine theory as fact. The case against Professor Southall was not simply to alert the police of his suspicion based on experience. Rather it was to give an expert statement of opinion that a father was a murderer beyond reasonable doubt knowing only what he had seen on a television programme, thereby putting that father at risk of having his son removed. Paediatricians who follow the legal rules and the guidelines written up by the GMC have nothing to fear. The RCPCH would do well to follow the example of the Royal College of Pathologists who addressed the problems and took immediate steps to put it right, rather than spreading unnecessary alarm in a misguided attempt to dilute the responsibilities of fallen colleagues.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{comparative}} theological {{exploration of the}} challenges and opportunities presented by the Qur?&# 257;nic representation of Christianity as the People of the Book, ahl al-kit&# 257;b, in the Qur?&# 257;nic and commentary tradition; in its social, cultural and historical background; through the early Arabic Christian response; and in modern discourse {{for the purpose of}} improving the quality of interfaith dialogue and understanding of religious plurality. The research is divided into three parts. The first part explores the Qur?&# 257;nic understanding of the People of the Book through traditional Islamic exegesis, known as tafs&# 299;r, of four respected Islamic scholars whose work spans more than a thousand years. These scholars are Mujahid ibn Jabr (d. 722), Muhammad ibn Jarir Al-Tabari (d. 923), Ismail Ibn Kathir (d. 1373) and Muhammad Rashid Rida (d. 1935). The research demonstrates a wide range of opinions regarding Christians and Christianity. What the Qur?&# 257;n has to say is highly contextual. One very interesting feature of the research addresses the question concerning the salvific merits of Christianity after the arrival of Islam. Part two takes a closer look at two important themes developed in the traditional commentary of the Qur?&# 257;n. Through the application of a cluster of hermeneutical devices this thesis attempts to create a greater appreciation of the social-cultural landscape leading into the dawn of Islam. The first theme is the historical construct of the pre-Islamic period, the asb?b an-nuz?l, the occasion of revelation, on the Arabia Peninsula and environs. The traditional commentary suggests that this period was a time of lawlessness. Islamic culture refers to the period as al-j&# 257;hiliyya, the Time of Ignorance. The research presented, takes a wide angle view of the of the period by examining primary and secondary materials concerning the different social, cultural, religious, economic and political factors effecting the diachronic development of the religions of the People of the Book as it comes faces to face with nascent Islam. Since, understanding the context of the revelation of any verse is critical for interpreting the Qur?&# 257;n. The second theme examines the Arabic speaking Christian response to Islam. From earliest times, the extent Christian communities in contact with Muhammad and the generations that followed rejected key Qur?&# 257;nic theological criticisms of Christian faith in the Sonship of Jesus, as the Incarnation of God, as well as the Holy Trinity, as religious excesses. Consequently, {{it should come as no}} surprise that many Christians, particularly Arabic speaking Christians take issue with the Qur?&# 257;nic depiction of Christianity. The research of the post conquest period examines the nuanced social and political changes that take place in the Levant region of the Eastern Mediterranean. These changes facilitate the adoption of Islamic idiom as an apologetic tool of religious and interfaith dialogue of the time, kal&# 257;m, a natural progression from the use of Biblical and Greek philosophic reasoning. The scholars examined include Theodore Ab&# 363; Qurrah, (d. 820 C. E.), Sulaym&# 257;n ibn Hasan al-Ghazz&# 299; (b. 940 C. E.) and Paul of Antioch (c. 1200 C. E). Part Three of this thesis explores the modern use of the term People of the Book by several Christian and Muslim scholars in the context of our increasingly interconnected and pluralist societies. Here the focus is on the social, political and theological implications of the concept of the People of the Book. The thesis inquires what if anything has changed over the centuries of dialogue. The Muslim scholars examined include Yusuf Al-Qaradawi, Ataullah Siddiqui, Farid Esack, Tariq Ramadan and Nayla Tabbara. The Christian scholars examined include Daniel Madigan, Paolo Dall?Oglio, Fadi Daou. The findings of the research endorse the Islamic hermeneutical science of tafs&# 299;r by Christians interested in understanding the Qur?&# 257;n. Without a proper understanding of how Muslims form an authoritative understanding of the Qur?&# 257;n, Christians are left in a precarious position of attempting to interpret the Qur?&# 257;n through personal opinion, ijtih&# 257;d, which could <b>stray</b> into the <b>area</b> of heretic interpretation, bid?ah. The science of tafs&# 299;r is a formal system of interpreting the Qur?&# 257;n based on tradition. However, through sound scholarship and diligence new interpretations are possible provided that sound reasoning the primary import of a verse is understood in its occasion of revelation, asb?b an-nuz?l...|$|R
40|$|Let’s be clear: Bjorn Lomborg’s book is polemic, not science, says Clive Hamilton THE pin-up boy of anti-environmentalists {{is due in}} Australia for {{a lecture}} tour later this month. Danish {{statistician}} Bjorn Lomborg wrote a best-selling book, The Sceptical Environmentalist, which created waves by arguing that environmental decline has been grossly exaggerated and that, in truth, things have never been better. Lomborg’s book attracted a string of denials {{from some of the}} world 2 ̆ 7 s leading environmental scientists, who pointed out that the book’s litany of errors and misinterpretations {{can be explained by the}} fact that the author has no qualifications in any area related to it. This has not prevented Lomborg 2 ̆ 7 s Australian promoter, the Institute of Public Affairs, describing him as a ‘leading international environmental scientist’. Usually when academics <b>stray</b> from their <b>areas</b> of specialisation, they adopt a degree of caution and humility. Most have learned from their own disciplines how easy it is for neophytes to make fools of themselves. Lomborg displayed none of this humility, and it was no surprise to see his book methodically trashed by world-leading scientists writing in the most prestigious journals. But the death blow for Lomborg’s junk science came from his homeland. The Danish Committee on Scientific Dishonesty condemned the book as ‘clearly contrary to the standards of good scientific practice’. Rejecting the work as systematically biased, the committee concluded that the publication was subject to the accusation of ‘scientific dishonesty’. But the extraordinary publicity given to Lomborg 2 ̆ 7 s book must tell us something about the modern politics of the environment. It is clear that a small but influential minority detests environmentalists. Lomborg’s central argument is that most forms of environmental pollution are transient or have been exaggerated, and where the problem is real it is associated with the early phases of industrialisation. Environmental decline is therefore ‘best cured not by restricting economic growth, but by accelerating it’. It is true that many forms of pollution have been cleaned up in industrialised countries, although there are several vital exceptions (high-level nuclear waste, plastic wastes and greenhouse gas emissions are perhaps the most obvious). Factories can no longer dump toxic waste into rivers, and urban air pollution in most major cities is better than it was 30 years ago. These changes have been forced on industrialists, usually in the face of denial, obfuscation and outright opposition. It was not the car industry that led the push for lead-free petrol; it was the government at the behest of the citizenry. Thus, while Lomborg concludes that improvements to the natural environment render environmental activism unnecessary, in fact the gains only prove its effectiveness. A nation’s political system, rather than its wealth, determines its response to environmental threats. By noting the association between improvements in some forms of pollution and high incomes, Lomborg has confused correlation with causation, an unforgivable error for a statistician. Improvements in the environment do not follow naturally from more economic growth. Keeping pollution and toxic wastes relatively low and reducing them further requires an unceasing battle against the effects of economic growth. Laws requiring cars to have catalytic converters made a big difference, but most experts believe that the sheer growth in the volume of cars is now starting to offset the benefits of better technology. Urban air pollution is expected to begin to rise again. Things will become worse unless environmentalists and the citizenry in general insist on even tougher standards. It will not just happen as incomes rise, not least because tougher standards will be met with vigorous opposition from corporate interests. In Australia, some oil companies are strenuously resisting the tougher fuel and engine standards that the federal government says it wants to introduce, and in the US the Bush administration is winding back some of the environmental improvements introduced by the Clinton administration. Even the small step on the path to reducing greenhouse gases represented by the Kyoto Protocol has been fought by powerful vested interests. The governments of the US and Australia have done all they can to sabotage any agreement. Perhaps Bjorn Lomborg would like to nominate the level of national income at which he expects Australia and the US to abandon their opposition to the Kyoto Protocol. Last year a dozen esteemed environmental scientists wrote to Lomborg 2 ̆ 7 s publishers asking that they stop promoting the book. ‘We are deeply disturbed that Cambridge University Press would publish and promote an error-filled, poorly referenced and non-peer-reviewed work,’ they declared. They did not ask for the book to be suppressed; they suggested only that it be promoted honestly - as a political polemic rather than a work of science.

In particular, the research examines how both domestic and wild cats are subject to different protection under the law {{and the manner in which}} ambiguities concerning the status of wild and domestic cats impose liability on humans for their actions in dealing with cats. The research was commissioned by the Feline Advisory Bureau (FAB) (now International Cat Care (iCatCare)) on behalf of the Cat Group 1 who identified that a number of legal questions could arise for cat owners for which there does not currently seem to be a definitive answer. While {{the legal status}} of cats is, in principle, well established under common law as they are personal property, problems can occur because cats exist in a range of states e. g. feral, semi-feral, domesticated and <b>stray.</b> Some grey <b>areas</b> exist in relation to animal welfare legislation and in respect of the liabilities of cat owners. There has been little or no attention paid by legal researchers to addressing {{the legal status of}} cats except within the context of animal welfare offences, some prior research into offences involving wild cats 2 and research into whether animals (including cats) can be said to have legal rights. 3 The research considers this issue in the context of not just the enforcement of animal welfare law but also within the context of other aspects of the law, which includes policy and ethical considerations relating to animal ownership and welfare. The research deals primarily with domestic cats in England and Wales. The primary legislation imposing responsibilities on cat owners is the Animal Welfare Act 2006, which consolidates much earlier legislation and both promotes animal welfare and provides an enforcement mechanism through which punishment may be pursued where there is a breach of animal welfare standards. The UK Animal Welfare Acts 4 are part of the criminal law and impose a duty to ensure welfare (although this research is not confined to evaluating welfare considerations) and an important part of the Acts is the requirement for a ‘responsible person’ to ensure that a cat’s needs are met. However, the question of what constitutes ownership or being a responsible person and whether a cat is domestic is not always straightforward. Our research also deals with offences under wildlife legislation where these may impact on cats living in a wild state or on recognised species of wild cat. Separate from the provisions of keeping and care of a cat, the research also considers issues relating to the sale or theft of cats noting that under the common law cats are regarded as property or objects, albeit animate, in terms of being owned and possessed. Damage to a cat by a third party can be akin to (certain) property damage giving cat owners the right to take action for redress to damage to ‘their’ animal. The issue of liability is also dealt with by this research and the courts have clarified a number of issues relating to the harm caused by cats and liability in respect of that harm, which we discuss in this research, treating aspects of the common law and the imposition of strict liability under the Animals Act 1971. The question of liability is not always a straightforward issue; while there are specific provisions for example in the Environmental Protection Act 1990 concerning nuisance caused by animals, they have been strictly interpreted so that the natural behaviour of a cat is generally not considered to be a nuisance even where damage is caused. However, cases where an excessive number of cats is kept such that their noise or odour cause harm to the health of neighbours or constitute a nuisance have also been decided such that the cat’s owner is responsible and can be required to take action to abate the 4 There is country-specific legislation in Scotland and Northern Ireland; the Animal Health & Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 and the Welfare of Animals Act (Northern Ireland) 2011. The three animal welfare acts have similar aims of preventing harm and promoting animal welfare although there are some differences in the respective Acts. Lincoln Law School, Middlesex School of Law - A Report for International Cat Care 7 nuisance. 5 In addition, the Department for the Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) Code of Practice on the Welfare of Cats contains provisions on keeping cats in a suitable environment. While the Code holds ‘advisory’ status rather than itself being enforceable, we argue that the Code’s guidance combined with the Animal Welfare Act’s provisions changes the dynamics of liability such that action might be taken under the Animal Welfare Act 2006, allowing the court to consider a failure to provide the necessary catfriendly environment required by the Act (in accordance with the Code),as opposed to considering the specific nuisance requirements of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. This widens the scope of the action that might be taken against cat owners, and is significant in the fact that the focus for the imposition of liability has shifted from the harm caused to other humans to the degradation of the health and welfare of the cat. We explicitly consider this issue in the research. This research investigates different aspects of the law as it applies to cats and conducts an analysis of the requirements placed on cat owners under the law. It also considers how the law can be interpreted on issues of liability, responsibility, and the care of cats, as well as the ambiguities in the status of cats that give rise to confusion under the law. This report thus attempts to provide not only an overview of the law but our analysis of some of the main areas of confusion raised by iCatCare as causing problems for cat owners and, where applicable, for re-homing institutions. 6 Some of these questions inevitably touch on compensation and recompense issues where complaints or claims for loss or damage arise. While dealing with the substantive issues of liability, responsibility and legal protection in answering questions, we only briefly deal with compensation issues as the specifics of cat, business, and even home, insurance relevant to such claims are outside the scope of this research...|$|R
