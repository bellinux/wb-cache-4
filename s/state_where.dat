5|$|After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, Montana was {{tasked with}} convoy escort and {{training}} ship duties. With {{the end of}} the war in November 1918 came a new task, transporting American soldiers back from the battlefields of Europe. She made six round trips to France and carried back a total of 8,800men.
