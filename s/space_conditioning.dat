40|$|Two {{types of}} {{consolidated}} memory {{have been described}} in Drosophila, anesthesia-resistant memory (ARM), a shorter-lived form, and stabilized long-term memory (LTM). Until now, it has been thought that ARM and LTM coexist. On the contrary, we show that LTM formation leads to the extinction of ARM. Flies devoid of mushroom body vertical lobes cannot form LTM, but <b>spaced</b> <b>conditioning</b> can still erase their ARM, resulting in a remarkable situation: The more these flies are trained, the less they remember. We propose that ARM acts as a gating mechanism that ensures that LTM is formed only after repetitive and spaced training...|$|R
5000|$|The {{intermediate}} term {{memory trace}} {{is dependent on}} expression of the amn gene located in dorsal paired medial neurons. An increase in calcium influx and synaptic release that innervates the mushroom bodies becomes detectable approximately 30 minutes after pairing of electric shock with an odor, and persists {{for at least an}} hour. Both long-term memory traces that have been mapped depend on activity and protein synthesis of CREB and CaMKII, and only exist after <b>spaced</b> <b>conditioning.</b> The first trace is detected in α/β neurons between 9 and 24 hours after conditioning, and is characterized by an increase in calcium influx in response to the conditioned odor. The second long-term memory trace forms in the γ mushroom bodies and is detected by increase calcium influx between 18 and 24 hours after conditioning ...|$|R
50|$|The {{residential}} sector is all private residences, including single-family homes, apartments, manufactured homes and dormitories. Energy {{use in this}} sector varies significantly across the country, due to regional climate differences and different regulation.

50|$|Like all {{ground source heat pumps}}, direct {{exchange}} systems indirectly harvest solar energy, by {{absorbing the}} solar heat stored at the Earth's surface. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has called ground source heat pumps the most energy-efficient, environmentally clean and cost-effective <b>space</b> <b>conditioning</b> systems available. Geothermal heat pumps offer significant emission reductions potential.|$|E
5000|$|The {{efficiency}} of furnaces and air conditioners has increased steadily since the energy crises of the 1970s. The 1987 National Appliance Energy Conservation Act authorized the Department of Energy to set minimum efficiency standards for <b>space</b> <b>conditioning</b> equipment and other appliances each year, {{based on what}} is [...] "technologically feasible and economically justified". Beyond these minimum standards, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) awards the Energy Star designation to appliances that exceed industry efficiency averages by an EPA-specified percentage.|$|E
40|$|Conditioning the {{proboscis}} extension reflex of harnessed honeybees (Apis mellifera) is used {{to study}} the effect temporal <b>spacing</b> between successive <b>conditioning</b> trials has on memory. Retention is monitored at two long-term intervals corresponding to early (1 and 2 d after conditioning) and late long-term memory (3 and 4 d). The acquisition level is varied by using different conditioned stimuli (odors, mechanical stimulation, and temperature increase at the antenna), varying strengths of the unconditioned stimulus (sucrose), and various numbers of conditioning trials. How learning trials are spaced is the dominant factor both for acquisition and retention, and although longer intertrial intervals lead to better acquisition and higher retention, the level of acquisition per se does not determine the spacing effect on retention. Rather, <b>spaced</b> <b>conditioning</b> leads to higher memory consolidation both during acquisition and later, between the early and long-term memory phases. These consolidation processes can be selectively inhibited by blocking protein synthesis during acquisition. Learning trials distributed over time lead to better memory than learning trials squeezed into short periods of time.

50|$|Energy usage in some homes {{may vary}} widely from these averages. For example, milder regions {{such as the}} Southern U.S. and Pacific Coast of the USA need far less energy for <b>space</b> <b>{{conditioning}}</b> than New York City or Chicago. On the other hand, air conditioning energy use can be quite high in hot-arid regions (Southwest) and hot-humid zones (Southeast) In milder climates such as San Diego, lighting energy may easily consume up to 40% of total energy. Certain appliances such as a waterbed, hot tub, or pre-1990 refrigerator, use significant amounts of electricity. However, recent trends in home entertainment equipment can make a large difference in household energy use. For instance a 50-inch LCD television (average on-time of six hours a day) may draw 300 watts less than a similarly sized plasma system. In most residences no single appliance dominates, and any conservation efforts must be directed to numerous areas {{in order to achieve}} substantial energy savings. However, ground, air and water source heat pump systems, solar heating systems and evaporative coolers are among the more energy efficient, environmentally clean, and cost-effective <b>space</b> <b>conditioning</b> and domestic hot water systems available (Environmental Protection Agency), and can achieve reductions in energy consumptions of up to 69%.|$|E
50|$|Mixed-mode {{ventilation}} {{refers to}} a hybrid approach to <b>space</b> <b>conditioning</b> that uses a combination of natural ventilation from operable windows (either manually or automatically controlled), and mechanical systems that include air distribution equipment and refrigeration equipment for cooling. A well-designed mixed-mode building begins with intelligent facade design to minimize cooling loads. It then integrates the use of air conditioning when {{and where it is}} necessary, with the use of natural ventilation whenever it is feasible or desirable, to maximize comfort while avoiding the significant energy use and operating costs of year-round air conditioning.|$|E
50|$|The {{commercial}} sector consists of retail stores, offices (business and government), restaurants, {{schools and other}} workplaces. Energy in this sector has the same basic end uses as the residential sector, in slightly different proportions. <b>Space</b> <b>conditioning</b> is again the single biggest consumption area, but it represents only about 30% of the energy use of commercial buildings. Lighting, at 25%, plays a much larger role than {{it does in the}} residential sector. Lighting is also generally the most wasteful component of commercial use. A number of case studies indicate that more efficient lighting and elimination of over-illumination can reduce lighting energy by approximately fifty percent in many commercial buildings.|$|E

40|$|Distinct {{forms of}} memory can be {{highlighted}} using different training protocols. In Drosophila olfactory aversive learning, one conditioning session triggers memory formation independently of protein synthesis, while five <b>spaced</b> <b>conditioning</b> sessions {{lead to the}} formation of long-term memory (LTM), a long-lasting memory dependent on de novo protein synthesis. In contrast, one session of odour-sugar association appeared sufficient for the fly to form LTM. We designed and tuned an apparatus that facilitates repeated discriminative conditioning by alternate presentations of two odours, one being associated with sugar, as well as a new paradigm to test sugar responsiveness (SR). Our results show that both SR and short-term memory (STM) scores increase with starvation length before conditioning. The protein dependency of appetitive LTM is independent of the repetition and the spacing of training sessions, on the starvation duration and on the strength of the unconditioned stimulus. In contrast to a recent report, our test measures an abnormal SR of radish mutant flies, which might initiate their STM and LTM phenotypes. In addition, our work shows that crammer and tequila mutants, which are deficient for aversive LTM, present both an SR and an appetitive STM defect. Using the MB 247 -P[switch] system, we further show that tequila is required in the adult mushroom bodies for normal sugar motivation...|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} studies have shown {{substantial}} energy savings by tightening building envelopes. The ASIEPI project technical report on building and ductwork airtightness estimates the energy impact of envelope airtightness in the order of 10 kWh per m2 of floor area per year, for the heating needs in a moderately cold region (2500 degree-days). Experimental data showing the energy savings of good airtightness were also published by the Building Research Establishment in the UK as well as REHVA journals' special issue on airtightness. They conclude 15% of the <b>space</b> <b>conditioning</b> energy use can be saved in the UK context going from 11.5 m3/(m2·h) @50 Pa (average current value) down to 5 m3/(m2·h) @50 Pa (achievable).|$|E
50|$|The primary {{method for}} <b>space</b> <b>conditioning</b> is a hydronic, in-slab radiant {{system that is}} located in the exposed {{concrete}} ceiling slabs on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th floors. These systems are often referred to as thermally activated building systems. The radiant system is used for both heating and cooling. To chill the water in the radiant system, the system makes use of a cooling tower located on the roof. Because the radiant system has a large surface area and high thermal mass, it is able to use warmer chilled water temperatures than a typical cooling system. This makes it a good match for non-compressor-based cooling. The cooling tower is able to chill the supply water using only the outdoor air, without any chiller.|$|E
50|$|Underfloor air {{distribution}} (UFAD) is an {{air distribution}} strategy for providing ventilation and <b>space</b> <b>conditioning</b> in buildings {{as part of}} the design of an HVAC system. UFAD systems use an underfloor supply plenum located between the structural concrete slab and a raised floor system to supply conditioned air through floor diffusers directly into the occupied zone of the building. Thermal stratification is one of the featured characteristic of UFAD system, which allows higher thermostat setpoints compared to the traditional overhead systems (OH). UFAD cooling load profile is different from a traditional OH system due to the impact of raised floor, particularly UFAD may has higher peak cooling load than OH systems. UFAD has several potential advantages over traditional overhead systems, including layout flexibility, improved thermal comfort, improved ventilation efficiency, improved energy efficiency in suitable climates and reduced life cycle costs. UFAD is often used in office buildings, particularly highly-reconfigurable and open plan offices where raised floors are desirable for cable management. UFAD is appropriate for a number of different building types including commercials, schools, churches, airports, museums, libraries etc. Notable buildings using UFAD system in North America include The New York Times Building, Bank of America Tower and San Francisco Federal Building. Careful considerations need to be paid in the construction phase of UFAD systems to ensure a well-sealed plenum to avoid air leakage in UFAD supply plenum.|$|E

40|$|Animals form memory {{types that}} differ in {{duration}} and stability. The initial anaesthesia-sensitive memory (ASM) {{can be replaced}} by anaesthesia-resistant memory (ARM), and/or by protein synthesis-dependent, long-term memory (LTM). We previously showed that two closely related parasitic wasp species differ in learning rate and memory consolidation. In Cotesia glomerata, LTM lasting at least 24 h was formed after single-trial conditioning, whereas single-trial conditioning led to ARM that waned before 24 h in Cotesia rubecula. This species formed LTM only after repeated <b>conditioning</b> trials <b>spaced</b> in time. Here, we used artificial selection on learning rate to investigate whether selection for a low learning rate in C. glomerata would result in C. rubecula-like memory dynamics. Memory consolidation was tested by using cold-shock anaesthesia and protein synthesis inhibitors. After single-trial conditioning, ARM was consolidated within hours in unselected C. rubecula, but directly, without an intermediate ARM phase, into LTM in unselected C. glomerata. We obtained low learning rate selection lines of C. glomerata wasps that, like C. rubecula, did not form LTM after single-trial conditioning, to see whether such wasps would then consolidate ARM instead of LTM. We showed {{that this was not}} the case. The selected wasps formed LTM after repeated, <b>spaced</b> <b>conditioning</b> trials, but formed only ASM without consolidation of ARM or LTM after single-trial learning. Ecological consequences of this type of memory formation are discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|This study uses a three-step {{approach}} {{to estimate the}} impact of global warming on U. S. energy expenditures for space heating and cooling in residential and commercial buildings. First, average results from six different global circulation models are used to estimate the change in heating and cooling degree days in five U. S. climate zones associated with a 10 centigrade (C) global warming. Second, the change in degree days is mapped into a corresponding change in U. S. energy use for <b>space</b> <b>conditioning,</b> taking account of differences in population and baseline <b>space</b> <b>conditioning</b> intensity levels across regions, {{under the assumption that}} desired indoor temperature is unaffected by climate change. Finally, we estimate the associated change in energy expenditures. We find that a global warming of 1 degree C would reduce projected U. S. energy expenditures in 2010 by $ 5. 5 billion (1991 dollars). This contrasts with earlier studies which have suggested modest global warming would increase U. S. expenditures on <b>space</b> <b>conditioning</b> energy. ...|$|E

40|$|Industrial halls are {{characterized}} with their rectangular shape and relatively simple construction, as contrasted with office buildings with similar floor area. Industrial halls are usually subject to high energy demand {{due to the}} many manufacturing processes, lighting, and the corresponding amount spent on <b>space</b> <b>conditioning.</b> Thermal comfort is seldom a concern for industrial halls. By contrast, saving in energy consumption for lighting and <b>space</b> <b>conditioning</b> {{is a big issue}} since even the modest percentage change in energy consumption could be translated into a large monetary sum. With relatively loose requirement in <b>space</b> <b>conditioning,</b> and comparatively high internal heat gain; the approach in industrial hall design is quite different from that of office building. In fact, what poses to be an energy efficient design for office buildings might not be appropriate for high internal heat gain halls. The simplicity in the building geometry and the construction method allow the investigation of energy demand for <b>space</b> <b>conditioning</b> to be limited to a few number of demand side parameters (e. g. insulation value of walls); in which, change in values in some of the parameters presents {{a significant impact on the}} overall energy demand. This paper investigates the impact of varying different demand side parameters on the energy demand for <b>space</b> <b>conditioning</b> and lighting for a typical industrial hall. Through building energy simulation, such impact can be investigated; and by applying optimization, the configurations of the most optimal combinations of parameters with the lowest energy demand can be identified. The result indicates that the energy demand of the least efficient configuration can be more than double of that of the optimized design solution. This paper will also explore green building assessment systems such as LEED, in terms of energy performance, with the studied industrial hall as an example. The huge energy saving brought by the optimized design solution over the baseline building of LEED suggests that there might be a potential deficiency of LEED rating system at its current state as it applies to industrial halls...|$|E
