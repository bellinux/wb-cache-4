[...] It was all spur of the moment, man". [...] Over two days at Chess, a backing track was completed and the Yardbirds continued their American concert tour. [...] Shortly after arriving in Hollywood, the group resumed recording at Columbia studios on 7 January and at RCA studios on 10 January 1966. [...] Singer Keith Relf contributed lyrics and a melody for the song.|$|E
500|$|The flag {{being so}} very large, mother {{was obliged to}} obtain {{permission}} from the proprietors of Claggetts [...] brewery which was in our neighborhood, to <b>spread</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> in their malt house; and I remember seeing my mother down on the floor, placing the stars: {{after the completion of}} the flag, she superintended the topping of it, having it fastened in the most secure manner to prevent its being torn away by (cannon) balls: the wisdom of her precaution was shown during the engagement: many shots piercing it, but it still remained firm to the staff. Your father (Col. Armistead) declared that no one but the maker of the flag should mend it, and requested that the rents should merely be bound around.|$|E
500|$|Glee costume {{designer}} Lou Eyrich described Rachel's costuming {{in an interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Originally, the inspiration for her look was Tracy Flick from Election—very buttoned-down, preppy, obnoxious, squeaky clean, nerdy. But she's got at least 12 costume changes each episode. That same look all the time just gets boring for the screen and for the actress to wear, so we <b>spread</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> a lot. We try to have her buttoned-up or wearing a nerdy sweater over a cute dress, like she doesn't quite get it right. Or she takes that sweater and tucks it into the skirt and pairs it with knee highs and flats. She makes it her way, which is more quirky. The popular girls {{find a way to make}} it look cool, but Rachel makes it look nerdy. But it's not old-school nerdy with thick glasses and pocket protectors. She thinks she's taking a trend and making it cool, but she wears it wrong." ...|$|E

50|$|Due to the 2008 {{financial}} crisis, and {{to encourage}} businesses and high-net-worth individuals to keep their cash in the largest banks (rather than <b>spreading</b> <b>it</b> <b>out),</b> Congress temporarily increased the insurance limit to $250,000. With {{the passage of the}} Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, this increase became permanent as of July 21, 2010.|$|R
50|$|ODBPP {{supports}} {{objects that}} are hierarchical in design, similar to XML, JSON or serialized PHP. It is this hierarchical object that separates object databases from their relational cousins {{and it is the}} process of keeping the entire object in one record rather than <b>spreading</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> over multiple tables that give object databases the distinction from the relational model.|$|R

While beating the gold ever-thinner <b>spreads</b> <b>it</b> <b>out,</b> widening the distance between the couple, the gold now covers more room—it has spread and become pervasive. Beating it to [...] "aery thinness"—distributing it throughout the air—means that the love is now part of the atmosphere itself.|$|R

60|$|He {{thrust his}} hand into his {{waistcoat}} pocket, and withdrew thence a minute packet of brown paper. <b>Spreading</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> he disclosed, coiled in the middle, another long hair. It was the hair the clerk's wife had found on Manston's pillow nine days before the Carriford fire. He held the two hairs to the light: they were both of a pale-brown hue. He laid them parallel and stretched out his arms: they were of the same length to a nicety. The detective turned to Anne.|$|R
60|$|And {{time and}} again we watched the darting albicore, the fish with the chain-plate armor and golden scales; the Nimrod of the seas, to whom so many flying fish fall a prey. Flying from their pursuers, many of them flew into our boat. But {{invariably}} they died from the shock. No nursing could restore them. One of their wings I removed, <b>spreading</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> to dry under a weight. In two days' time the thin membrane, all over tracings {{like those of a}} leaf, was transparent as isinglass, and tinted with brilliant hues, like those of a changing silk.|$|R

Nonlinearity tends to localize the wave while dispersion <b>spreads</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> The balance between these weak nonlinear steepening and dispersion effect formulate the solitons (Wazwaz 2009). The KdV equation is used to model the disturbance of the surface of shallow water {{in the presence of}} solitary waves. The KdV equation is a generic model for the study of weakly nonlinear long waves, incorporating leading order nonlinearity and dispersion (Wazwaz 2009; Marchant and Smyth 1996). Also, it describes surface waves of long wavelength and small amplitude on shallow water (Monro and Parkes 1999, 2000; Zakharov and Faddeev 1971).|$|R

The headline reads [...] "H-Bomb Capable of Total Destruction". Once Renard opens the paper and looks at the racing page, several in-jokes are apparent in the names of the listed jockeys, which include [...] "Serling", [...] "Clemens" [...] (referencing director of photography George Clemens), [...] "Houghton" [...] (referencing producer Buck Houghton), [...] "Butler" [...] (referencing set decorator Rudy Butler), and [...] "Denault" [...] (referencing assistant director Edward Denault).|$|R
60|$|One day, {{after we}} had been {{paddling}} about for some time, I disembarked Kory-Kory, and paddled the canoe to the windward side of the lake. As I turned the canoe, Fayaway, who was with me, seemed all at once to be struck with some happy idea. With a wild exclamation of delight, she disengaged from her person the ample robe of tappa which was knotted over her shoulder (for the purpose of shielding her from the sun), and <b>spreading</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> like a sail, stood erect with up-raised arms in {{the head of the}} canoe. We American sailors pride ourselves upon our straight clean spars, but a prettier little mast than Fayaway made was never shipped aboard of any craft.|$|R

60|$|They had {{not gone}} far, when the road passed by a field where some haymakers were at work, mowing down the tall grass, and <b>spreading</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> in the sun to dry. Daffydowndilly was delighted with {{the sweet smell of}} the new-mown grass, and thought how much pleasanter it must be to make hay in the sunshine, under the blue sky, and with the birds singing sweetly in the {{neighboring}} trees and bushes, than to be shut up in a dismal school-room, learning lessons all day long, and continually scolded by old Mr. Toil. But, in the midst of these thoughts, while he was stopping to peep over the stone wall, he started back and caught hold of his companion's hand.|$|R
60|$|On {{this subject}} of {{treating}} it as a wrong and limiting its spread, {{let me say}} a word. Has anything ever threatened {{the existence of this}} Union save and except this very institution of slavery? What is it that we hold most dear amongst us? Our own liberty and prosperity. What has ever threatened our liberty and prosperity save and except this institution of slavery? If this is true, how do you propose to improve the condition of things by enlarging slavery,--by <b>spreading</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> and making <b>it</b> bigger? You may have a wen or a cancer upon your person, {{and not be able to}} cut <b>it</b> <b>out</b> lest you bleed to death; but surely it is no way to cure it, to engraft <b>it</b> and <b>spread</b> <b>it</b> over your whole body. That is no proper way of treating what you regard as a wrong. You see this peaceful way of dealing with it as a wrong,--restricting the <b>spread</b> of <b>it,</b> and not allowing it to go into new countries where it has not already existed. That is the peaceful way--the old-fashioned way--the way in which the fathers themselves set us the example.|$|R

50|$|The {{light from}} the stars was {{captured}} with optical fibres, precisely positioned by a robot. The robot picks up optical fibres, one by one, and places them on a metal plate in the telescope. Each fibre is {{in the right place}} to catch the light from a single star. By using many fibres, more than 100 stars can be studied at the same time. Travelling down the tiny glass threads, the starlight enters an instrument that <b>spreads</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> into its component wavelengths or 'colours', the way a prism does. These colours tell astronomers about the chemical elements a star contains and how it is moving. From that, the astronomers can work out how old the stars are, where they came from, and how they are related. And that's the key that unlocks the history of our Galaxy.|$|R

"Eighteen-year-old Britney Spears, 1999's biggest-selling new artist, <b>spreads</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> like soft {{cream cheese}} on her fourth-to-be runaway smash single, as dreamy and freash as that first spin of [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] {{over a year}} ago. It's her first ballad, {{following}} that No. 1 debut as well as [...] "Sometimes" [...] and the recented [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy", yet [...] "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart" [...] still possesses a breezy air that is certain to continue her breakneck success on the singles charts. Eric Forster White is at the helm this time, writing and producing a song that will easily appeal to Miss Spears' young core, {{with the potential to}} chart the more mature AC audience, too. [...] Spears' star is shining brighter than ever, and this wholesome track will only serve to illuminate it all the more. An ace." ...|$|R
