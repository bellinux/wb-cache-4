40|$|ABSTRACT In this thesis, I {{evaluate}} how {{fiscal and}} monetary <b>stimulus</b> <b>policies</b> {{contribute to the}} economic recovery process of recessions in the United States. Using a case study approach, I will study ten major recessions over the 20 th century and early 21 st century to answer this question. I will study the different fiscal and monetary policies implemented during the following recessions: the Great Depression; the Recession of 1937, the Recession of 1945, the Recession of 1953, the 1973 - 75 Recession, the 1980 Recession, the Early 1980 s Recession, the Early 1990 s Recession, the Early 2000 s Recession, and the Late- 2000 s Recession. The literature suggests {{a wide range of}} conflicting viewpoints as to the most effective <b>stimulus</b> <b>policies</b> for economic recovery. I conclude that while both monetary and fiscal <b>stimulus</b> <b>policies</b> have been effective in contributing to GDP growth and reductions in unemployment, it is evident that each recession requires a unique policy response. In many cases, I find value in implementing both monetary and fiscal policy, jointly, as they complement one another. I also find that, generally, monetary policy is most effective in contributing to the economic recovery process of recessions through open market operations that reduce the interest rate and that fiscal policy is most effective in contributing to the economic recovery process of recessions through government spending. My systematic exploration of these policies and the recession case studies, provide valuable information of the effects of these policies and provide insight into the appropriate use of <b>stimulus</b> <b>policies</b> in the current economy and for future recessions and recoveries...|$|R

50|$|Any {{additional}} {{spending by}} government must be financed, by drawing down reserves, by additional taxes or by issuing additional government debt instruments (i.e. borrowing). Increased taxes exactly matched to increased spending might seem designed {{to draw out}} of the circulating flow of the economy an amount of income in taxes exactly equal to the amount being injected by additional government purchases. Increased borrowing to finance additional government purchases might also be supposed to be designed to draw out of the circulating flow an amount equal to the additional government purchases, perhaps by crowding out private borrowing for investment spending. In the history of economic thought, the notion that any increase in government spending necessarily crowds out {{an equal amount of}} private spending or investment, through taxation or borrowing, and thus has no net impact on economic activity, is known as the Treasury View, and is regarded as generally fallacious. The argument that the choice of taxes or borrowing to finance government spending must be equivalent in that taxpayers observe borrowing and save in anticipation of taxes to repay the borrowing is known as Ricardian Equivalence, and is sometimes cited as a rationale for believing that fiscal <b>stimulus</b> <b>policy</b> will be made futile by the reactions of rational consumers and businesses, reducing their spending or investing in exact proportion to increases in public spending, in a scenario similar to that envisioned in the Treasury View.|$|E
5000|$|Ezra Klein {{wrote in}} August 2011: [...] "What distinguishes crises {{like this one}} from typical recessions is {{household}} debt. When the financial markets collapsed, household debt was nearly 100 percent of GDP. It’s now down to 90 percent. In 1982, which {{was the last time}} we had a big recession, the household-debt-to-GDP ratio was about 45 percent. That means that in this crisis, indebted households can’t spend, which means businesses can’t spend, which means that unless government steps into the breach in a massive way or until households work through their debt burden, we can’t recover. In the 1982 recession, households could spend, and so when the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates and made spending attractive, we accelerated out of the recession. The utility of calling this downturn a “household-debt crisis” is it tells you where to put your focus: you either need to make consumers better able to pay their debts, which you can do through conventional <b>stimulus</b> <b>policy</b> like tax cuts and jobs programs, or you need to make their debts smaller so they’re better able to pay them, which you can do by forgiving some of their debt through policies like principal reduction or eroding the value of their debt by increasing inflation. I’ve heard various economist make various smart points about why we should prefer one approach or the other, and it also happens to be the case that the two policies support each other and so we don’t actually need to choose between them. All of these solutions, of course, have drawbacks: if you put the government deeper into debt in order to help households now, you increase the risk of a public-debt crisis later. That’s why it’s wise to pair further short-term stimulus with a large amount of long-term deficit reduction. If you force banks to swallow losses or face inflation now, you need to worry about whether they’ll be able to keep lending at a pace that will support recovery over the next few years. But as we’re seeing, not doing enough isn’t a safe strategy, either." ...|$|E

The pattern of global oil demand, real oil price, and world economy in the future is studied through system dynamics modeling. Based on the simulation, the oil demand will drop and then gradually recover while the real oil price will be stable and then drop mimicking a sigmoid curve. The economy will continuously increase. If an economic <b>stimulus</b> <b>policy</b> is implemented, the oil demand is expected to have a shallower drop. Thus, the real oil price is likely to be an S-shaped curve with a higher value, and the economy is expected to grow faster as compared to the case when there is no <b>stimulus</b> <b>policy.</b> Samii, M., & Teekasap, P.

40|$|Cash for Clunkers was a 2009 {{economic}} stimulus {{program aimed at}} increasing new vehicle spending by subsidizing the replacement of older vehicles. Using a regression discontinuity design, we show the increase in sales during the two-month program was completely offset during the following seven to nine months, consistent with previ-ous research.

40|$|We provide {{evidence}} {{on the effect of}} property transaction taxes (stamp duty) on house prices, the timing of house purchases, and the volume of house purchases. To address these questions, we exploit administrative stamp duty records covering the universe of property transactions in the UK from 2004 - 2012 along with compelling sources of quasi-experimental variation. First, discontinuous jumps in the stamp duty at threshold property prices—notches—allow us to estimate the effect of the tax on house prices. Second, anticipated and unanticipated changes in the tax schedule allow us to estimate the dynamics of price responses and timing effects on house transactions. Third, a stimulus program that temporarily exempted certain properties from tax—a stamp duty holiday—allows us to provide micro evidence on both timing and extensive margin responses to macro <b>stimulus</b> <b>policy.</b> We find that the effect of transaction taxes on house prices is large (200 - 500 % of the tax itself) and that adjustment to changes in transaction taxes is very fast. We also find that the timing of house transactions responds sharply to anticipated tax increases. Finally, temporary cuts in transaction taxes successfully stimulate housing market activity in the short run—an elimination of the tax increases transaction volume by about 20 %—followed by a slump in activity after the policy is withdrawn. However, post-stimulus reversal is far from complete (30 - 40 % of the initial boost), implying that stimulus has a long-run extensive margin effect in addition to a pure timing effect. This contradicts recent findings in the literature and has potentially important implications for evaluating macro <b>stimulus</b> <b>policy...</b>|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{fiscal policy}} coordination in the EU during the Great Recession (2008 - 2010). For {{the first time}} since the Maastricht Treaty heralded the coordination of macroeconomic policies among EU Member States, public finances were collectively focused on <b>stimulus</b> <b>policies.</b> In sharp contrast to the preceding decade of consolidation and constraint, fiscal policy coordination during the Great Recession presents a novelty: a study in fiscal expansion. Drawing on Mancur Olson’s Logic of Collective Action, this thesis uses a mixed-methods approach that combines the insights from over 40 in-depth interviews and econometric analyses. The central argument of this thesis is that the fiscal crisis responses of EU Member States were not coordinated. Yet despite this lack of coordination, free-riding was kept at bay. First, the overarching consensus on the need for counter-cyclical fiscal policies prevented growth free-riding (i. e. a situation of limited domestic stimulus and free-riding on other countries’ expansive fiscal policies). Second, discipline imposed by financial market participants contributed to policy-makers’ awareness of their limited room for fiscal manoeuvre, which meant that stability free-riding (i. e. <b>stimulus</b> <b>policies</b> that exceeded a country’s fiscal space) did not occur. The first finding suggests the importance of shared policy ideas in achieving collective action; the second points to the role of financial markets in constraining public finances. Ultimately both, shared policy ideas and market discipline, can function as a substitute for strong institutional commitment to shape group oriented behaviour...|$|R
