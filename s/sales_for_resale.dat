2500|$|Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Wisconsin, 347 U.S. 672 (1954), {{was a case}} {{decided by}} the Supreme Court of the United States holding that sale of natural gas at the {{wellhead}} was subject to regulation under the Natural Gas Act. Prior to this case, independent producers sold natural gas to interstate pipelines at unregulated prices with any subsequent <b>sales</b> <b>for</b> <b>resale</b> being regulated.

[...] Natural gas producers argued that wellhead sales were exempt from federal regulation as [...] "production and gathering."

40|$|Institutional {{barriers}} {{to the use of}} natural gas as a fuel for motor vehicle fleets were identified. Recommendations for barrier removal were developed. Eight types of institutional barriers were assessed: (1) lack of a national standard for the safe design and certification of natural gas vehicles and refueling stations; (2) excessively conservative or misapplied state and local regulations, including bridge and tunnel restrictions, restrictions on types of vehicles that may be fueled by natural gas, zoning regulations that prohibit operation of refueling stations, parking restrictions, application of LPG standards to LNG vehicles, and unintentionally unsafe vehicle or refueling station requirements; (3) need for clarification of EPA's tampering enforcement policy; (4) the U. S. hydrocarbon standard; (5) uncertainty concerning state utility commission jurisdiction; (6) <b>sale</b> <b>for</b> <b>resale</b> prohibitions imposed by natural gas utility companies or state utility commissions; (7) uncertainty of the effects of conversions to natural gas on vehicle manufactures warranties; and (8) need for a natural gas to gasoline equivalent units conversion factor for use in calculation of state road use taxes...|$|R
5000|$|Natural gas is {{typically}} produced {{in association with}} oil from wells. Wells can also be drilled into geological formations that have mostly gas and very little oil. In the infancy of the oil industry, any natural gas produced from oil wells was burned off. Later, states passed conservation laws which required the gas to be captured and transported in pipelines for useful purposes. In order to prevent any gaps in the natural gas regulation when natural gas flows in interstate commerce, Congress enacted the Natural Gas Act of 1938. That law required that companies must obtain from the Federal Power Commission (FPC) a [...] "certificate of public convenience and necessity" [...] (certificate) before making any <b>sale</b> <b>for</b> <b>resale</b> natural gas in interstate commerce. The FPC set the maximum prices charged for gas sold under a certificate. For example, if gas flowed from a well in Texas through a pipeline to New York where it was sold to a gas distribution company, the sale by the pipeline to the distributor would need a certificate. The final sale to retail customers were exempt from the law. Although the Natural Gas Act regulated both the transportation and sale of gas in interstate commerce, the [...] "production and gathering" [...] of gas was exempt from federal regulation, although potentially subject to state control. Production means bringing the gas {{out of the ground}} to a pipe {{at the top of the}} wellhead. Gathering refers to the flow of gas through low pressure lines to the center of a gas field where the gas is treated and compressed to bring it up to the high pressures used in long-distance pipelines.|$|R

These MFP indexes, together with the partial factor productivity (PFP) indexes, {{can be used as}} managerial tools to identify the possible inefficient utilization of input resources. They also provide a rough overview of how well these input resources are being managed;In this study, output is defined as the sales of electricity to the ultimate customers and <b>sales</b> <b>for</b> <b>resale.</b> The input resources are capital, labor, fuel, purchased power and miscellaneous materials, which were aggregated by means of the methodology developed using their cost shares as weights. A case study of this productivity model was carried out for the period 1974 - 1979;A goal programming model, a technique of operations research, was also developed to allocate the input resources in an efficient and effective manner so that a certain percentage growth in productivity can be satisfied and the other objectives (goals) of the electric power system also be fully met. The productivity measures coupled with the goal programming technique are shown to be a very useful tool to assist management in making crucial decisions with respect to input resources in any electric utility company...|$|E
