40|$|The wave dynamic {{differential}} logic (WDDL) {{has been}} identified as a promising countermeasure to increase the robustness of cryptographic devices against differential power attacks (DPA). However, to guarantee the effectiveness of WDDL technique, the routing in both the direct and complementary paths must be balanced. This paper tackles the problem of unbalance of dual-railsignals in WDDL design. We describe placement techniques suitable for tree-based and mesh-based FPGAs and quantify the gain they confer. Then, we introduce a timing-balance-driven routing algorithm which is architecture independent. Our placement and routing techniques proved to be very promising. In fact, they achieve a gain of 95 %, 93 %, and 85 % in delay balance in tree-based, simple mesh, and cluster-based mesh architectures, respectively. To reduce further the switch and delay unbalance in Mesh architecture, we propose a differential pair routing algorithm that is specific to cluster-based mesh architecture.

This paper compares and evaluates the in situ performances of three commonly used chiller sequencing control strategies. These three control strategies are operating online in parallel on a management and communication platform in a super high-rise building in Hong Kong. The comparison and evaluation focus on the perspectives of chiller <b>switch</b> <b>number,</b> electrical peak demand and overall energy consumption in one week. Meanwhile, the different impacts of two systematic errors (i. e. positive errors which cause direct measurement larger than true value and negative errors which cause measurement smaller than true value) on each control strategy are also analyzed. The performance comparison demonstrates that the strategy, using fused cooling load measurement, achieved the best performance. The applications of the online computed chiller maximum cooling capacity and the advanced data fusion technique, which removes the negative impacts of sensor measurement uncertainties, can significantly improve the performance of chiller sequencing control.

30|$|In this paper, a decimal {{coding scheme}} {{that the whole}} <b>switch</b> <b>number</b> of each tie branch {{constitutes}} the base vectors, and identity number of open switch on each tie branch taken as the optimization variables are proposed. With such a coding scheme, the length of chromosome {{is equal to the}} number of independent meshes on the graph of distribution network. Therefore, it is very short. In the genetic algorithm, one sub-population corresponds to one spanning tree. Selection, crossover, mutation, reinsertion operations are all taken in sub-population with paralleling computing method. Individuals of offspring after gene operation automatically meet radial and connected constraints for distribution network operation. None unfeasible solutions are produced and none ameliorating operation is needed. The disadvantages of conventional genetic algorithm for distribution network reconfiguration that a huge number of unfeasible solutions which result in very low search efficiency brought in the process of crossover and mutation operation are completely overcome. When the specified number of evolution generation is reached, the chromosome whose objective function value is minimal in the whole population is output as the global optimal solution. Two simulation cases indicate the proposed algorithm greatly improve calculation speed.|$|E

40|$|Differential-mode {{buck-boost}} inverters have merits such as reduced <b>switch</b> <b>number,</b> {{ability to}} provide voltages higher or lower than the input voltage magnitude, improved efficiency, reduced cost and size, and increased power density, especially in low-power applications. There are five buck-boost inverters that can provide flexible output voltage without the need of a large electrolytic input side capacitor, which degrades the reliability of inverters. The continuous input current of these inverters is appropriate for {{maximum power point tracking}} operation in photovoltaic and fuel cells applications. Three of the five inverters can be isolated with high-frequency-link transformers where the common-mode leakage current can be mitigated. However, the performance and control of such converters have not been discussed in detail. In this paper, the five possible single-stage three-phase differential-mode buck-boost inverters with continuous input current are investigated and compared in terms of total losses, maximum ripple current, total harmonic distortion, and device and passive element ratings. In addition, the possible methods are presented for eliminating the input third-order harmonic current, resulting from the stored energy in the passive elements, as well as the output second-order harmonic currents. The ability for isolating the input and output sides of the inverters with a small-high frequency transformers is discussed. A changeable-terminal 2. 5 -kW bidirectional inverter is used to validate the design flexibility of the inverter topologies, when digital signal processor-controlled.
