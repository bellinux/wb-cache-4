25|$|A {{new party}} of regime supporters, the Revolutionary National Union (Unión Nacional Revolucionaria), {{was founded in}} November 1936. Although the new party called for {{representative}} democracy, rights for peasants and workers, and <b>socialization</b> <b>of</b> key industries, it failed to broaden Franco's political base. In the end, Franco lost his popular support because he failed to keep his promises to the poor. He dared not expropriate the properties of foreign landowners, who were mostly Argentines. In addition, the Liberals, who still had influential support in the army, agitated constantly for Franco's overthrow. When Franco ordered Paraguayan troops to abandon the advanced positions in the Chaco that they had held since the 1935 truce, the army revolted in August 1937 and returned the Liberals to power.|$|E

25|$|Women {{were the}} primary vehicle for rumors that touched upon issues of family and {{everyday}} life. Fears that collectivization {{would result in the}} <b>socialization</b> <b>of</b> children, the export of women’s hair, communal wife-sharing, and the notorious common blanket affected many women, causing them to revolt. For example, when it was announced that a collective farm in Crimea would become a commune and that the children would be socialized, women killed their soon-to-be socialized livestock, which spared the children. Stories that the Communists believed short hair gave women a more urban and industrial look insulted peasant women. After local activists in a village in North Caucasus actually confiscated all blankets, more fear dispersed among villagers. The common blanket meant that all men and women would sleep on a seven-hundred meter long bed under a seven-hundred-meter long blanket. Historians argue that women took advantage of these rumors without actually believing them so they could attack the collective farm “under the guise of irrational, nonpolitical protest.” Women were less vulnerable to retaliation than peasant men, and therefore able to get away with a lot more.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Zimbardo {{began working}} with Sarah Brunskill and Anthony Ferreras on a new theory called the social {{intensity}} syndrome (SIS). SIS is a new term coined to describe and normalize the effects military culture has on the <b>socialization</b> <b>of</b> both active soldiers and veterans. Zimbardo and Brunskill presented the new theory and a preliminary factor analysis of it accompanying survey at the Western Psychological Association in 2013. Brunskill finished the data collection in December 2013. Through an exploratory component factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, internal consistency and validity tests demonstrated that SIS was a reliable and valid construct of measuring military socialization. Fifty-eight items were deemed viable and six factors were identified; military friends (16 items), family (11 items), gender social preference (7 items), social bonding (11 items), nostalgia (9 items) and drug use (4 items). Identifying and standardizing SIS was the first step, further research has identified that 4 demographic categories within the military; active and have been deployed (AD), active and never been deployed (AND), inactive and have been deployed (ID) and inactive and never been deployed (IND). These are important categories to better understand how service members are affected leaving the military.|$|E

If Mohism, rich in scientific thought, had rapidly grown and strengthened, the situation might have been very favorable {{to the development of a}} scientific structure.

During the late Eastern Han, disastrous upheavals again occurred in the process of social transformation, leading to the greatest social disorder in Chinese history. One can imagine the effect of this calamity on science.|$|E
500|$|Much {{like her}} {{previous}} albums, {{the record is}} feminist, with greater exploration of gender issues and conflated with [...] "an unwavering look at black female sexual agency." [...] Soraya McDonald of The Washington Post viewed Beyoncé as significant to black feminism as it celebrates black female sexuality in mainstream music and {{in the context of}} hip hop, where it is typically only shown through the male perspective. The album's most explicit commentary on gender is the three-part [...] "Flawless". It opens with the earlier released [...] "Bow Down", before seguing into an excerpt of a speech by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie on the <b>socialization</b> <b>of</b> girls. The final part uses a staccato, trap beat as Beyoncé reflects on her own feminist attitudes, encouraging self-acceptance among women and criticizing misogynist sentiments.|$|E
500|$|Compulsory Miseducation is a {{critique}} of American public schools written by Paul Goodman and published by Horizon Press in 1964. Already established as a social critic of American society {{and the role of}} its youth in his previous book Growing Up Absurd (1960), [...] Goodman argues in Compulsory Miseducation against the necessity of schools for the <b>socialization</b> <b>of</b> youth and recommends their abolition. He suggests that formal education lasts too long, teaches the wrong social class values, and increasingly damages students over time. Goodman writes that the school reflects the misguided and insincere values of its society and thus school reformers should focus on these values before schools. He proposes a variety of alternatives to school including no school, the city or farm as school, apprenticeships, guided travel, and youth organizations. Reviewers complimented Goodman's style and noted his deliberate contrarianism, but were split on the feasibility of his proposals. Goodman's book was a precursor to the work of deschooling advocate Ivan Illich.|$|E

500|$|Kirchner {{was often}} {{labelled}} a left-wing and progressive president, {{with the cultural}} critic Alejandro Kaufman stating that Kirchner was [...] "an Argentine social democrat: a centre-left Peronist", who had been elected on a [...] "moderate-progressive" [...] platform. However, that assessment is relative. Although he was left of previous Argentine presidents from Raúl Alfonsín to Eduardo Duhalde and contemporary Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, he was right of other Latin American presidents such as Hugo Chávez and Fidel Castro. Kirchner's nationalist approach to the Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute was closer to the right, {{and he did not}} consider left-wing policies such as the <b>socialization</b> <b>of</b> production or the nationalization of public services which were privatized during the Menem presidency. He did not attempt to modify church–state relations or reduce the armed forces. Kirchner's economic views were influenced by his tenure in the government of Santa Cruz: a province rich in oil, gas, fish and tourism, with an economy focused on the primary sector. Usually avoiding long-term policies, he moved left or right according to circumstances. Many leftist activists in Argentina were cynical about the sincerity of his commitment to progressive ideals and to aiding the country's underclass.|$|E
500|$|In Great Basin Kingdom, Arrington {{traces the}} Mormon pioneer {{practices}} of [...] "central planning, organized cooperation, and the partial <b>socialization</b> <b>of</b> investment implicit in Mormon theory" [...] {{to the democratic}} theory of the Founding Fathers of the United States. Arrington also noted that pioneers found religious significance in creating farms out of previously wild land, making irrigation central to their way of life. The way Mormons freely distributed irrigation water—through a central canal and diverted when needed—reflected their communal values. While the Mormon cooperative economy died out in the 1880s, their cooperative spirit anticipated later governmental planning. Great Basin Kingdoms thorough documentation called attention to previously hidden sources in the LDS Church Archives. Dean L. May and Donald Worster criticized Great Basin Kingdom for overreaching its thesis that organized irrigation could rejuvenate a culture. One biographer attributes Arrington's overvaluing Mormon achievements {{to a lack of}} empirical studies on pioneer settlements at the time. Still, the book was received as an instant classic that raised the standard for Mormon scholarship. Dale L. Morgan, though critical of the lack of attention to the Gentile (i.e., non-Mormon) influence on Mormons, said that it was an indispensable ordering of Mormon data. The book is still considered one of the significant books on Mormon history.|$|E
2500|$|On December 11, the PSDR {{transformed}} {{itself into}} the Socialist Party of Romania. Its program, written down by Șerban Voinea in 1919, specified that the members stood for [...] "scientific socialism" [...] and the <b>socialization</b> <b>of</b> property, but also for reformism (in {{the absence of a}} revolutionary class). The PS was immediately approached for secretive talks by radicalized members of the establishment, grouped in the People's Party (PP). The central issue was the PS' nominal support for republicanism, which was also espoused by some of the PP doctrinaires—though not by the party leader, General Alexandru Averescu. In exchange for support, Averescu was ready to co-opt the PS into a future government. Moscovici was among the PS representatives who discussed the matter with PP emissaries Constantin Argetoianu and P. P. Negulescu. In the end, the socialists were adamant in their rejection of a compromise.|$|E
