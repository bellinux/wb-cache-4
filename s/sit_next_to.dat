5|$|The {{simplest}} molluscan {{reproductive system}} relies on external fertilization, {{but with more}} complex variations. All produce eggs, from which may emerge trochophore larvae, more complex veliger larvae, or miniature adults. Two gonads <b>sit</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the coelom, a small cavity that surrounds the heart, into which they shed ova or sperm. The nephridia extract the gametes from the coelom and emit them into the mantle cavity. Molluscs that use such a system remain of one sex all their lives and rely on external fertilization. Some molluscs use internal fertilization and/or are hermaphrodites, functioning as both sexes; both of these methods require more complex reproductive systems.|$|E
5|$|The Sega CD {{received}} several variations during its lifetime, of which Sega constructed three. The original model utilized a front-loading motorized disc tray and sat underneath the Genesis. Sega later released the second {{model of the}} Sega CD, which was redesigned to <b>sit</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the Genesis console and featured a top-loading disc tray {{in place of the}} motorized tray of the original model. In addition to the add-on models, Sega also released the Genesis CDX (Multi-Mega in Europe). This console was a combination of the Genesis and Sega CD in one unit and initially retailed at US$399. Unique to this model was its additional functionality as a portable compact disc player.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{model of}} the Millennium Monument was {{the starting point of}} the Peristyle appearance in Chicago. To this day, it is said to not compare to the once “commanding presence” that once stood in its place, before being demolished and replaced with an underground parking garage. The new monument was downsized by approximately 15% to accommodate a wheel-chair ramp for the disabled in a tight space. It also includes a “classical” take on the original, incorporating a fountain {{at the base of the}} limestone, Doric, column monument. The monument, despite being relatively small in comparison to the rest of Grant Park, makes its presence known as the central focus to shape Wrigley Square and the surrounding landscape. Wrigley Square is unique for its fountain that, unlike Buckingham Fountain, which is fenced off, remains open with a circular ledge to allow park-goers the freedom to <b>sit</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the open water to enjoy the atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump: Though at {{an early}} age he is deemed to have a below average IQ of 75, he has an endearing {{character}} and shows devotion to his loved ones and duties, character traits which bring him into many life-changing situations. Along the way, he encounters many historical figures and events throughout his life. Tom's younger brother Jim Hanks is his acting double in the movie for the scenes when Forrest runs across the U.S. Tom's daughter Elizabeth Hanks appears in the movie as the girl on the school bus who refuses to let young Forrest (Michael Conner Humphreys) <b>sit</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> her. John Travolta was the original choice to play the title role, and admits passing on the role was a mistake. Bill Murray and Chevy Chase were also considered for the role. Sean Penn stated in an interview having been second choice for the role. Hanks revealed that he signed onto the film after {{an hour and a half}} of reading the script. He initially wanted to ease Forrest's pronounced Southern accent, but was eventually persuaded by director Robert Zemeckis to portray the heavy accent stressed in the novel. Hanks agreed to take the role only on the condition that the film was historically accurate.|$|E

25|$|Interrupting the Amidah is forbidden. The only {{exceptions}} are {{in cases of}} danger or for one who needs to relieve oneself, though this rule may depend on the movement of Judaism. There are also halakhot to prevent interrupting the Amidah of others; for example, it is forbidden to <b>sit</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> someone praying or to walk within four amot (cubits) of someone praying.|$|E
25|$|The Rorschach test is {{appropriate}} for subjects {{from the age of}} five to adulthood. The administrator and subject typically <b>sit</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> each other at a table, with the administrator slightly behind the subject. Side-by-side seating of the examiner and the subject is used to reduce any effects of inadvertent cues from the examiner to the subject. In other words, side-by-side seating mitigates the possibility that the examiner will accidentally influence the subject's responses.|$|E

25|$|The Prince of Wales, Albert Edward ("Bertie", later Edward VII), {{arranged}} to <b>sit</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> Langtry {{at a dinner}} party given by Sir Allen Young on May 24, 1877. (Lillie's husband Edward was seated {{at the other end of}} the table.) Although the Prince was married to Princess Alexandra and had six children, he was a well-known philanderer. He became infatuated with Langtry, and she soon became his de facto mistress. She was presented to the Prince's mother, Queen Victoria. Princess Alexandra was generous in never displaying any jealousy about her husband's infidelities and accepted and acknowledged Lillie.|$|E
25|$|Finding himself {{seated on}} a couch with Socrates and Agathon, Alcibiades exclaims that Socrates, again, has managed to <b>sit</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> the handsomest man in the room, Agathon, {{and that he is}} always doing such things (213c). Socrates asks Agathon to protect him from the jealous rage of Alcibiades, asking Alcibiades to forgive him (213d). Alcibiades says he will never do such a thing (213e). Wondering why {{everyone}} seems sober, Alcibiades is informed of the night's agreement (213e, c); after saying his drunken ramblings should not be placed next to the sober orations of the rest, and that he hopes no one believed a word Socrates said, Alcibiades proposes to offer an encomium to Socrates (214c-e).|$|E
25|$|De Gaulle's {{policy was}} to {{postpone}} elections {{as long as}} 2.6 million French were in Germany as prisoners of war and forced laborers. In mid-September, he embarked upon a tour of major provincial cities to increase his public profile and to help cement his position. Although he received a largely positive reception from the crowds who came out to see him, he reflected {{that only a few}} months previously the very same people had come out to cheer Marshal Pétain when he was serving the Vichy regime. Raymond Aubrac said that the General showed himself to be ill-at-ease at social functions; in Marseille and Lyon he became irate when he had to <b>sit</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> former Resistance leaders and also voiced his distaste for the rowdy, libidinous behavior of French youths during the Maquisard parades which preceded his speech. When he reached Toulouse, de Gaulle also had to confront the leaders of a group which had proclaimed themselves to be the provincial government of the city.|$|E

500|$|In September 1974, Ronald Belford [...] "Bon" [...] Scott, an {{experienced}} vocalist {{and friend of}} George Young, replaced Dave Evans after friend Vince Lovegrove recommended him to George Young.

The band had recorded only one single with Evans, [...] "Can I <b>Sit</b> <b>Next</b> <b>To</b> You, Girl" [...] / [...] "Rockin' in the Parlour"; eventually, the song was re-written and re-recorded with Bon Scott as [...] "Can I <b>Sit</b> <b>Next</b> <b>to</b> You Girl" [...]|$|E
500|$|By 1856 Quimby had 500 {{patients}} a year. He would <b>sit</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> them and {{explain that the}} disease was something their minds could control; sometimes he would wet his hands and rub their heads, {{but it was the}} talking that helped them, he said, not the manipulation. Quimby began to write his thoughts down around 1859—his work was published posthumously as The Quimby Manuscripts in 1921—and was generous in allowing his patients to copy one of his essays, [...] "Questions and Answers." [...] This became an issue, from 1883 onwards, when Eddy was accused of having based Christian Science on his work.|$|E
500|$|In September 1972, Vulović {{expressed}} {{willingness to}} resume {{working as a}} flight attendant. The airline apparently felt that her presence on flights would attract too much publicity and instead gave her a desk job negotiating freight contracts. Vulović was celebrated as a national hero and decorated by Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito. The Serbian folk singer Miroslav Ilić recorded a song in her honour, titled Vesna stjuardesa ("Vesna the Stewardess"). She continued to fly regularly and stated that fellow passengers were surprised to see her on flights. [...] "People always want to <b>sit</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> me on the plane," [...] she remarked.|$|E
