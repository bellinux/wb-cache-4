40|$|We {{calibrated}} {{the magnitude}} and symmetry of seismic anisotropy for 132 mica- or amphibole-bearing metamorphic rocks to constrain their departures from transverse isotropy (TI) which is usually assumed {{in the interpretation of}} seismic data. The average bulk V[p] anisotropy at 600 MPa for the chlorite <b>schists,</b> mica <b>schists,</b> phyllites, sillimanite-mica <b>schists,</b> and amphibole <b>schists</b> examined is 12. 0 %, 12. 8 %, 12. 8 %, 17. 0 %, and 12. 9 %, respectively. Most of the <b>schists</b> show V[p] anisotropy in the foliation plane which averages 2. 4 % for phyllites, 3. 3 % for mica <b>schists,</b> 4. 1 % for chlorite <b>schists,</b> 6. 8 % for sillimanite-mica <b>schists,</b> and 5. 2 % for amphibole <b>schists.</b> This departure from TI is due to the presence of amphibole, sillimanite, and quartz. Amphibole and sillimanite develop strong crystallographic preferred orientations with the fast c axes parallel to the lineation, forming orthorhombic anisotropy with V[p](X) >V[p](Y) >V[p](Z). Effects of quartz are complicated, depending on its volume fraction and prevailing slip system. Most of the mica- or amphibole-bearing <b>schists</b> and mylonites are approximately transversely isotropic in terms of S wave velocities and splitting although their P wave properties may display orthorhombic symmetry. The results provide insight for the interpretation of seismic data from the southeast Tibetan Plateau. The N-S to NW-SE polarized crustal anisotropy in the Sibumasu and Indochina blocks is caused by subvertically foliated mica- and amphibole-bearing rocks deformed by predominantly compressional folding and subordinate strike-slip shear. These blocks have been rotated clockwise 70 - 90 ° around the east Himalayan Syntaxis, without finite eastward or southeastward extrusion, in responding to progressive indentation of India into Asia. 27 page(s...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Tas oluk {{kaolinite}} {{deposits of}} Afyonkarahisar (western Anatolia) are hosted by both pre-Early Cambrian sericitic mica-chlorite <b>schists</b> and Neogene volcanites, the latter comprising tuffs and agglomerates. These units {{have been affected}} by hydrothermal alteration controlled by faults resulting in complex, irregular, lateral mineralogical zonation. The occurrence of a siliceous cap on altered <b>schists</b> and in claystone, of quartz veins in <b>schists</b> and tuffs, and the development of explosion cones and pit fillings indicate that alteration in both the <b>schists</b> and the volcanites is due to hydrothermal processes. Altered <b>schists</b> have generally large (locally small) Fe contents, and claystones are generally silicified and have small Fe contents. Kaolinite predominates south and west of Tas oluk, whereas high (Fe+Ti) -bearing illite + kaolinite predominate in other altered sections. The kaolinite exhibits a stacked micromorphology within altered <b>schists,</b> and the altered volcanites record in situ precipitation, derived from a mechanism of paired dissolution and precipitation. Illite fibres coexist with kaolinite, smectite, chlorite, mica and sericitized feldspar in markedly altered <b>schists,</b> revealing that the illite formed either authigenically or by conversion of smectite to illite. A relative increase in Cr+Ni and decrease in Sr+Ba in the kaolinite deposits and their schistose host rock relative to the upper level of the kaolinite deposits and their volcanic parent rocks came about by th...|$|R
