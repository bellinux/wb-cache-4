25|$|Members of the {{subfamily}} Microvirinae {{have four}} structural proteins: major capsid protein F, major <b>spike</b> <b>protein</b> G, a small DNA-binding protein J (25 - 40 amino acids in length) and DNA pilot protein H. Assembly of the viron uses two scaffolding proteins, internal scaffolding protein B and external scaffolding protein D. Protein H is a multifunctional structural protein required for piloting the viral DNA into the host cell interior during the entry process. The genomes are between 5.3 and 6.2 kilobases (kb) in length.|$|E
25|$|Members of the {{subfamily}} Gokushovirus {{have only}} two structural proteins: capsid proteins F (Virus Protein 1) and DNA pilot protein H (Virus Protein 2) and do not use scaffolding proteins. They also possess 'mushroom-like' protrusions positioned at the three-fold axes of symmetry of their icosahedral capsids. These are formed by large insertion loops within the protein F of gokushoviruses and are absent in the microviruses. They lack both the external scaffolding protein D and the major <b>spike</b> <b>protein</b> G of the species in the genus Microvirus. The genomes of this group tend to be smaller—about 4.5 kb in length. This subfamily includes the genera Bdellomicrovirus, Chlamydiamicrovirus and Spiromicrovirus.|$|E
25|$|The major {{capsid protein}} (F) has 426 amino acids, the major <b>spike</b> <b>protein</b> (G) has 175 amino acids, the small DNA-binding protein (J) has 25–40 amino acids, and the DNA pilot protein (H) has 328 amino acids. The major folding motif of protein F is the eight-stranded {{antiparallel}} beta barrel common to many viral capsid proteins. The G protein is a tight beta barrel with its strands running radially outward. The G proteins occur {{in groups of}} five forming 12 spikes that enclose a hydrophilic channel. The highly basic J protein lacks any secondary structure and is situated in an interior cleft of the F protein. It has no acidic amino acid residues in the protein and the twelve basic residues are concentrated in two clusters in the N-terminus separated by a proline-rich region.|$|E

40|$|As the <b>spike</b> <b>proteins</b> of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) {{pass from}} their site of {{synthesis}} in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) {{to the cell}} surface, they must be concentrated and freed from endogenous proteins.

40|$|Frozen, thin {{sections}} of baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells were incubated with either concanavalin A (Con A) or Ricinus communis agglutinin I (RCA) to localize specific oligosaccharide moieties in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi membranes. These lectins were then visualized using an anti-lectin antibody followed by protein A conjugated to colloidal gold. All Golgi cisternae and all ER membranes were uniformly labeled by Con A. In contrast, RCA gave a uniform labeling of only half to three-quarters of those cisternae on the trans {{side of the}} Golgi stack; one or two cis Golgi cisternae and all ER membranes were essentially unlabeled. This pattern of lectin labeling was not affected by infection of the cells with Semliki Forest virus (SFV). Infected cells transport only viral spike glycoproteins from their site of synthesis in the ER to the cell surface via the stacks of Golgi cisternae {{where many of the}} simple oligosaccharids on the <b>spike</b> <b>proteins</b> are converted to complex ones (Green, J., G. Griffiths, D. Louvard, P. Quinn, and G. Warren. 1981. J. Mol. Biol. 152 : 663 - 698). It is these complex oligosaccharides that were shown, by immunoblotting experiments, to be specifically recognized by RCA. Loss of <b>spike</b> <b>proteins</b> from Golgi cisternae after cycloheximide treatment (Green et al.) was accompanied by a 50 % decrease in the level of RCA binding. Hence, about half of the RCA bound to Golgi membranes in thin sections was bound to <b>spike</b> <b>proteins</b> bearing complex oligosaccharides and these were restricted to the trans part of the Golgi stack.

40|$|AbstractBudding of enveloped viruses from {{cellular}} membranes {{is believed to}} depend on the presence of transmembrane <b>spike</b> <b>proteins</b> interacting with cytoplasmic virus components. To address the mechanism of rhabdovirus budding, we generated rabies virus mutants deficient for the glycoprotein G or the G cytoplasmic tail. We found that spikeless rhabdovirus particles were released from cells infected with the G-deficient mutant, demonstrating that a viral surface protein is not required to drive the budding process. However, particle production is enhanced approximately 6 -fold and 30 -fold in the presence of tailless G or G, respectively. This reveals that G also possesses an intrinsic and independent exocytosis activity. We propose a model according to which efficient budding of rhabdoviruses is achieved by a concerted action of both core and <b>spike</b> <b>proteins...</b>|$|R

50|$|TGEV infects pigs. However, {{in young}} pigs, the {{mortality}} rate is close to 100%. The pathology of TGEV {{is similar to that}} of other coronaviruses. Coronaviruses enter the host by first attaching to the host cell using the spike glycoprotein. The S protein interacts with the porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN), a cellular receptor, to aide in its entry. The same cell receptor is also a point of contact for Human Coronaviruses. A domain in the S <b>spike</b> <b>protein</b> is recognized by pAPN, and transfection of pAPN occurs to nonpermissive cells and infects them with TGEV. Once the virus infects the host, it multiplies in the cell lining of the small intestine resulting in the loss of absorptive cells that in turn leads to shortening of villi. The infected swine then has reduced capability for digesting food and die from dehydration.|$|E
40|$|Using {{synchrotron}} radiation {{as a light}} source, absorption spectra of membrane lipids and <b>spike</b> <b>proteins,</b> viral components of Sendai virus, were obtained in the wavelength regions from 130 nm to 320 nm.

40|$|The budding of enveloped viruses from {{cellular}} membranes {{is believed to}} be dependent on the specific interaction between transmembrane <b>spike</b> <b>proteins</b> and cytoplasmic core components of the virus. We found that the cytoplasmic domain of the E 2 transmembrane spike glycoprotein of Semliki Forest virus contains two essential determinants which are absolutely needed for budding. The first constitutes a single tyrosine residue {{in the context of a}} direct pentapeptide repeat. The tyrosine could only partially be substituted for other residues with aromatic or bulky hydrophobic side chains, although these immediately reverted to the original genotype. The second determinant involves palmitylated cysteine residues flanking the tyrosine repeat motif. The function of these is probably to anchor the tail against the inner surface of the membrane so that the tyrosine-containing motif is properly presented to the nucleocapsid. This is the first example where a membrane virus employs a tyrosine signal for the selective incorporation of <b>spike</b> <b>proteins</b> into budding structures...|$|R
40|$|Enveloped viruses mature by budding at {{cellular}} membranes. It {{has been}} generally {{thought that this}} process is driven by interactions between the viral transmembrane proteins and the internal virion components (core, capsid, or nucleocapsid). This model was particularly applicable to alphaviruses, which require both <b>spike</b> <b>proteins</b> and a nucleocapsid for budding. However, genetic studies have clearly shown that the retrovirus core protein, i. e., the Gag protein, is able to form enveloped particles by itself. Also, budding of negative-strand RNA viruses (rhabdoviruses, orthomyxoviruses, and paramyxoviruses) seems to be accomplished mainly by internal components, most probably the matrix <b>protein,</b> since the <b>spike</b> <b>proteins</b> are not absolutely required for budding of these viruses either. In contrast, budding of coronavirus particles can occur {{in the absence of}} the nucleocapsid and appears to require two membrane proteins only. Biochemical and structural data suggest that the proteins, which play a key role in budding, drive this process by forming a three-dimensional (cage-like) protein lattice at the surface of or within the membrane. Similarly, recent electron microscopic studies revealed that the alphavirus <b>spike</b> <b>proteins</b> are also engaged in extensive lateral interactions, forming a dense protein shell at the outer surface of the viral envelope. On the basis of these data, we propose that the budding of enveloped viruses in general is governed by lateral interactions between peripheral or integral membrane proteins. This new concept also provides answers to the question of how viral and cellular membrane proteins are sorted during budding. In addition, it has implications for the mechanism by which the virion is uncoated during virus entry...|$|R

[...] 2c betacoronaviruses were detected in Nycteris bats in Ghana and Pipistrellus bats in Europe that are phylogenetically related to the MERS-CoV virus.

40|$|Abstract Background A recent {{publication}} {{reported that}} a tyrosine-dependent sorting signal, present in cytoplasmic tail of the <b>spike</b> <b>protein</b> of most coronaviruses, mediates the intracellular retention of the <b>spike</b> <b>protein.</b> This motif is missing from the <b>spike</b> <b>protein</b> of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), resulting in high level of surface expression of the <b>spike</b> <b>protein</b> when it is expressed on its own in vitro. Presentation of the hypothesis It {{has been shown that}} the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus genome contains open reading frames that encode for proteins with no homologue in other coronaviruses. One of them is the 3 a protein, which is expressed during infection in vitro and in vivo. The 3 a protein, which contains a tyrosine-dependent sorting signal in its cytoplasmic domain, is expressed on the cell surface and can undergo internalization. In addition, 3 a can bind to the <b>spike</b> <b>protein</b> and through this interaction, it may be able to cause the <b>spike</b> <b>protein</b> to become internalized, resulting in a decrease in its surface expression. Testing the hypothesis The effects of 3 a on the internalization of cell surface <b>spike</b> <b>protein</b> can be examined biochemically and the significance of the interplay between these two viral proteins during viral infection can be studied using reverse genetics methodology. Implication of the hypothesis If this hypothesis is proven, it will indicate that the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus modulates the surface expression of the <b>spike</b> <b>protein</b> via a different mechanism from other coronaviruses. The interaction between 3 a and S, which are expressed from separate subgenomic RNA, would be important for controlling the trafficking properties of S. The cell surface expression of S in infected cells significantly impacts viral assembly, viral spread and viral pathogenesis. Modulation by this unique pathway could confer certain advantages during the replication of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus. </p...|$|E
