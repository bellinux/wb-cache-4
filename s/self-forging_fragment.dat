5000|$|The mine is {{triggered}} by a magnetic fuze when an appropriate target is detected, detonating the Misznay Schardin effect warhead, which produces a <b>self-forging</b> <b>fragment</b> capable of penetrating up to 80 millimeters of armor.|$|E
50|$|When triggered, {{the mine}} detonates a small {{clearing}} charge, which clears away any earth laid {{on top of}} the mine. It then fires the main warhead, which uses a metal liner to form a penetrating fragment which is projected into the belly of the vehicle passing over the mine. The <b>self-forging</b> <b>fragment</b> is capable of penetrating steel up to 200 millimeters thick.|$|E
50|$|An explosively formed {{penetrator}} (EFP), {{also known}} as an explosively formed projectile, a self-forging warhead, or a <b>self-forging</b> <b>fragment,</b> is a special type of shaped charge designed to penetrate armor effectively at standoff distances. As the name suggests, {{the effect of the}} explosive charge is to deform a metal plate into a slug or rod shape and accelerate it toward a target. They were first developed during WWII.|$|E
50|$|The AHM-200 weighs 35 {{kilograms}} {{and contains}} 12 kilograms of TNT. The mine's warhead has two sections, a large rectangular warhead with a pre-notched fragmentation liner that produces 1,960 fragments, and a secondary warhead with five Misznay Schardin plates that produce large <b>self-forging</b> <b>fragments.</b> The fragments scatter {{in an arc}} of 20 degrees to an effective range of 200 meters, and will penetrate 10 millimeters of armour at 100 meters.|$|R
50|$|The missile travels at {{supersonic}} speeds (Mach 2.5-Mach 3.0) at sea-skimming altitude with {{a special}} trajectory at the terminal phase, reducing the reaction time of the target ship. It also features an armor-piercing warhead which generates tremendous destruction after hitting the target. The warhead is equipped with <b>self-forging</b> <b>fragments</b> and in the 225 kg weight class. The warhead triggered by a smart fuze that directs most of the energy downwards, inside the target ship's hull.|$|R
50|$|The FFV 016 is a Swedish {{designed}} {{off-route mine}} {{designed for use}} against lightly armoured vehicles. The mine uses a Misznay Schardin effect warhead to produce a <b>self-forging</b> <b>fragment</b> that has an initial velocitiy of approximately 2,000 metres per second and can penetrate 60 mm of armour at 30 metres range. The mine's body is circular, with a dished front which is aimed using a simple built in sight along the expected route of the target.|$|E
50|$|Some anti-armor weapons {{incorporate}} a variant on the shaped charge concept that, {{depending on the}} source, can be called an explosively formed penetrator (EFP), <b>self-forging</b> <b>fragment</b> (SFF), self-forging projectile (SEFOP), plate charge, or Misznay Schardin (MS) charge. This warhead type uses {{the interaction of the}} detonation wave(s), {{and to a lesser extent}} the propulsive effect of the detonation products, to deform a dish or plate of metal (iron, tantalum, etc.) into a slug-shaped projectile of low length-to-diameter ratio and project this towards the target at around two kilometres per second.|$|E
50|$|The explosively formed {{penetrator}} (EFP) is {{also known}} as the <b>self-forging</b> <b>fragment</b> (SFF), explosively formed projectile (EFP), self-forging projectile (SEFOP), plate charge, and Misznay-Schardin (MS) charge. An EFP uses the action of the explosive's detonation wave (and to a lesser extent the propulsive effect of its detonation products) to project and deform a plate or dish of ductile metal (such as copper, iron, or tantalum) into a compact high-velocity projectile, commonly called the slug. This slug is projected toward the target at about two kilometers per second. The chief advantage of the EFP over a conventional (e.g., conical) shaped charge is its effectiveness at very great standoffs, equal to hundreds of times the charge's diameter (perhaps a hundred meters for a practical device).|$|E
5000|$|The HB-876 mines {{would lie}} {{scattered}} on the surface, making rapid repair of the runway very hazardous. The outside of the munition {{was surrounded by a}} [...] "coronet" [...] of spring steel strips that were held flat against the sides of the mine. After landing on the surface a small explosive device would fire and release the coronet springs such that the mine would become [...] "erect" [...] on the surface, with their <b>self-forging</b> <b>fragment</b> warhead pointing vertically upwards. The cylindrical case of the mine was made from dimpled steel and on detonation would spread small steel anti-personnel fragments, rather like a hand-grenade, in all radial directions. They would explode at preset intervals or if disturbed. Standing above the surface on the coronet of spring steel legs, they would tilt toward a bulldozer blade when pushed before detonating and firing the forged fragment toward the vehicle.|$|E
