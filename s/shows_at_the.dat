5|$|Shot on {{location}} in Rome and at Elios Studios, Tenebrae utilized mostly modern-looking locations and sets to help Argento realize his intent that the film reflect a near-future with a diminished population; the director filmed none of the historical landmarks that usually featured in films set in Rome. Employing director of photography Luciano Tovoli, Argento also intended that the film simulate the stark, realistic lighting featured in television police <b>shows</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time; production designer Giuseppe Bassa created supporting environments that were cold and austere, with sharp angles and modernistic spaces. Several former members of Italian rock band Goblin provided Tenebraes music, a synth-heavy score inspired by rock and disco music.|$|E

5|$|The {{details of}} Bede's story, and in {{particular}} of the miraculous nature of Cædmon's poetic inspiration, are not generally accepted by scholars as being entirely accurate, but there seems no good reason to doubt {{the existence of a}} poet named Cædmon.

5|$|The group {{went on a}} {{sell-out}} tour of the UK {{immediately following}} the album's release, but had to cancel the first date at the Green Playhouse, Glasgow due to electrical safety issues.

5|$|During her <b>shows</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Tokyo Dome during 1996, Carey {{sported a}} long and wavy hairstyle, while wearing a long black gown. She sang the {{original}} version of the song, up until halfway through the last chorus, until merging into the C+C remix. Several background vocalists were once again featured on stage, all donning black garbs. However, once the remix began, six male dancers {{made their way to}} the right and left sides of the stage, performing heavy dance routines as Carey walked around the stage. Once the remix began, the lighting was altered. Aside from the usual fluorescent lighting that was used throughout the show, additional pink and purple lighting was added for the number, as it served for the shows closing and final song. During her succeeding shows in Europe, Carey's outfits altered as well as her hairstyle. She wore a long, white strapless gown and sported her hair in a straightened ponytail style. Since 1996, Carey has not performed the song live on television or on her tours.|$|E
