500|$|Of these improvements, the <b>slide</b> <b>lock</b> is the {{one that}} made the Model 1897 into a safe firearm. This {{improved}} <b>slide</b> <b>lock</b> kept the shotgun locked until actual firing occurred which prevented it from jamming {{in the case of a}} misfire. The <b>slide</b> <b>lock</b> [...] "stands in such a relation to the body of the firing pin as will prevent the firing pin reaching the primer until the pin has moved forward a sufficient distance to insure locking of the breech bolt". This prevents the action sleeve [...] "from being retracted by the hand of the gunner until after firing, and hence rendering the firearm more safe".|$|E
2500|$|The Glock 17M, {{introduced}} in 2016, {{was created in}} response to an FBI solicitation for a new 9mm pistol. Differences from the Generation 4 model include removal of the finger grooves, ambidextrous <b>slide</b> <b>lock,</b> rounded slide nose profile, flared magwell with new magazine baseplates, and a tougher finish on metal components. The Glock 17M also abandons the polygonal rifling of previous models for conventional rifling. As of 2017, the Federal Bureau of Investigation. the South Carolina Highway Patrol and the Canadian Ontario Provincial Police [...] have adopted the pistol as standard.|$|E

2500|$|The Glock 19 is {{effectively}} a reduced-size Glock 17, called the [...] "Compact" [...] by the manufacturer. It was first produced in 1988, primarily for military and law enforcement. The Glock 19's barrel and pistol grip are shorter by about [...] {{compared to the}} Glock 17 and uses a magazine with a standard capacity of 15 rounds. The pistol is compatible with factory magazines from the Glock 17 and Glock 18, giving the Glock 19 available capacities of: 17 rounds (standard magazine with +2 extension), 10, 17, and 19 (standard Glock 17 magazine with +2), and the 31 (standard Glock 18 magazine with +2 removed) and 33 rounds of the Glock 18. To preserve the operational reliability of the short recoil system, {{the mass of the}} slide remains the same as in the Glock 17 from which it is derived. With the exception of the slide, frame, barrel, locking block, recoil spring, guide rod, and <b>slide</b> <b>lock</b> spring, all of the other components are interchangeable between the models 17 and 19 iwb holster.|$|E

50|$|Flintlocks using superposed charges often {{involved}} a <b>sliding</b> <b>lock,</b> that slid along the barrel and locked {{in place at}} each successive touch hole. The lock would be primed, cocked, and fired at each touch hole to discharge successive charges.

50|$|The various terms {{relate to}} the two {{functions}} of the component: while it automatically catches the <b>slide</b> (<b>locking</b> it back) after the magazine's last round has been fired, thereby allowing the user to easily release the slide by pulling down on the switch, it also allows the user to purposefully stop or <b>lock</b> the <b>slide</b> back by pressing up on the switch while racking the slide.|$|R
50|$|The M1951 {{is fed from}} an 8-round {{detachable}} box magazine. A hold open device {{will keep}} the <b>slide</b> <b>locked</b> open after discharging the last cartridge from the magazine. The slide can then be released by depressing the slide release lever located {{on the left side}} of the frame. The pistol uses fixed iron sights set for engaging targets at 50 m. These consist of a forward blade and rear notch.|$|R
50|$|The P2000 is a hammer-fired pistol with {{an exposed}} spurred hammer; a bobbed hammer is optional. It has an ambidextrous <b>slide</b> <b>lock</b> and a fully ambidextrous {{magazine}} release {{installed in the}} trigger guard.|$|E

50|$|A slide stop, {{sometimes}} referred to as a <b>slide</b> <b>lock</b> or (dubiously) a slide release on a semi-automatic handgun is a function that visually indicates when a handgun has expended all loaded ammunition and facilitates faster re-loading by pulling back the slide to advance the first round of a new magazine.|$|E
2500|$|Apple holds several patents {{related to}} the <b>sliding</b> <b>lock</b> screen used by its iOS devices: it was granted [...] in 2010, and [...] in 2011, {{describing}} a system that involves continuously dragging an image {{to a certain point}} to unlock the device.

5000|$|American {{inventor}} Joseph Belton {{combined the}} earlier superposed load concepts into the Belton flintlock, which used a <b>sliding</b> <b>lock</b> with multiple touchholes to ignite separated sets of fused charges, allowing multiple shots per {{pull of the}} trigger and multiple shots to be fired by repositioning and recharging the lock. Belton attempted to license his invention to the Continental Congress in 1777, and to the British Army and the East India Company in 1784.|$|R

50|$|One of the Obregón's design curiosities is {{that its}} safety switch and <b>slide</b> <b>lock</b> are a single unit. A few hundred of these pistols were {{produced}} at the national armory in Mexico City during the 1930s, but it was neither a sales success nor was it commissioned {{to be made for}} the Mexican government.|$|E

After Martha's funeral, Karen walks away alone, while Joe watches her from the distance.|$|E
50|$|Same as a blunt slide, only {{performed}} with the nose and the front wheels. 90-degree ollie over the object to be <b>sliding,</b> <b>locking</b> the nose into a slide position. Wheels drag across the ledge/platform like a power slide while the nose slides along the lip. on a rail, the rider 'ollies over' into a nose slide position. The term noseblunt, in downhill or flatground riding, refers to a powerslide happening on only the front two wheels.|$|R

5000|$|When {{the last}} round is fired and ejected, the <b>slide</b> will <b>lock</b> in the open position. There is no slide release on the Hi-Point [...]45 JHP, so {{releasing}} the slide is performed by pulling the <b>locked</b> <b>slide</b> further back. When another magazine is loaded into the weapon all that is necessary is a short pull back, unlike the full length pull to chamber the first round.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the design}} concept was geared towards law {{enforcement}} and military close quarters combat scenarios, there was inadequate demand for the weapon due to some problematic design issues in its conception. One such design feature was safety lever {{on the left side}} of the stamped steel receiver, above the pistol grip. The actuation of this lever is not possible without removing the left arm from the pump, and is difficult if the operator is wearing gloves. The same problem exists for the <b>slide</b> <b>lock</b> button. These problems were mainly found in the early models exported to the United States of America. The company then focused its attention on these issues and were solved by reducing the resistance of the safety lever and over-ride <b>slide</b> <b>lock</b> button. The user can now operate both levers effectively and easily without taking the left hand off the pump. Another issue that plagued the MAG-7 was the 7.7 Kgf trigger pull. It was also addressed by the manufacturer and reduced to an industry standard 3.5Kgf ...|$|E
50|$|Some Swiss Army knives feature locking blades {{to prevent}} {{accidental}} closure. Wenger {{was the first}} to offer a ″PackLock″ for the main blade on several of their standard 85mm models. Several large Wenger and Victorinox models feature a locking blade secured by a <b>slide</b> <b>lock</b> that is operated with an unlocking-button integrated in the scales. Some Victorinox 111 mm series knives feature a double liner lock that secures the cutting blade and large slotted screwdriver/cap opener/wire stripper combination tool designed towards prying.|$|E
50|$|Designed {{to be used}} as a {{concealed}} carry self-defense weapon, the Nano has no external <b>slide</b> <b>lock</b> or release. Additionally, the Nano has no external safety. The absence of these protruding controls reduces the likelihood of the weapon snagging on clothing during an occasion where a quick and clean draw is required. The slide locks in a rear position after the magazine has been emptied. A loaded magazine must then be installed, or the empty magazine withdrawn, and the slide must be pulled rearward, in order to cycle the slide completely.|$|E
5000|$|In contrast, a single-action (SA) {{semi-automatic}} pistol must be cocked {{by first}} operating the slide or bolt, or, if a round is already chambered, by cocking the hammer manually. The famed Colt M1911 {{is an example}} of this style of action. All SA semi-automatic pistols exhibit this feature, and automatically cock the hammer when the slide is first [...] "racked" [...] to chamber a round. A round can also be manually inserted in the chamber with the <b>slide</b> <b>locked</b> back. Then the safety can be applied.|$|R

5000|$|There are {{no known}} {{surviving}} examples of Belton's gun; in fact, {{the only evidence}} of its existence is the correspondence between Belton and Congress. Belton described the gun as capable of firing up to [...] "sixteen or twenty balls, in sixteen, ten, or five seconds of time". It is theorized that it worked {{in a manner similar}} to a Roman candle, with a single lock igniting a fused chain of charges stacked in a single barrel, packaged as a single large paper cartridge. [...] Despite commissioning Belton to build or modify 100 muskets for the military on May 3, 1777, the order was dismissed in May, 15, 1777, when Congress received Belton's bid and considered it an [...] "extraordinary allowance". [...] After the war was over, Belton is reported to have attempted to sell the design to the British Army, also without success. [...] Belton then began making superposed load flintlocks, which used a <b>sliding</b> <b>lock</b> mechanism, with the London gunsmith William Jover, and attempted to sell them to the East India Company. At least two examples survive, of pistols which utilize four touchholes, and these are housed in the Pitt Rivers Museum at the University of Oxford. [...] The Belton <b>sliding</b> <b>lock</b> design was later improved and used in slightly more successful designs, such as Isaiah Jenning's repeating flintlock rifle.|$|R
