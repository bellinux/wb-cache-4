5|$|By 1961, {{when all}} {{airframe}} maintenance at Laverton {{was transferred to}} Nos.2 and 3 Aircraft Depots, No.1 AD had serviced forty-two aircraft types throughout its existence. It continued to maintain aero engines, and began supporting telecommunications equipment as well. The aircraft engine repair facilities at No.1 AD were closed down in 1968. Staff were transferred to No.3 Aircraft Depot at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, {{to prepare for the}} introduction of the General Dynamics F-111C swing-wing bomber to Australian service and concentrate on maintaining the new aircraft's engines. No.1 AD's focus thereafter shifted to ground support, manufacturing, installing, servicing and providing training for navigational, air traffic control, telecommunications and motor transport equipment used by the Air Force and other sections of Defence and government. From 1968 to 1977, the depot was organised into two components, Telecommunications Installation and Maintenance Squadron and Ground Equipment Maintenance Squadron. These were subdivided in February 1977 into Telecommunications Squadron (maintaining ground communications equipment for control towers, transmitters and receiving stations in Australia and the region), Radar Squadron (supporting surveillance systems at RAAF Bases Williamtown, Amberley, Townsville, Darwin and Pearce), Ground Equipment Maintenance Squadron (maintaining motor transport, and other ground-based mechanical and electro-mechanical systems), and Intermediate Level Maintenance Squadron (communications, navigation and other ground-based maintenance at Laverton, as well as <b>spectrometric</b> <b>analysis</b> of oil used by the RAAF in aircraft and other equipment).|$|E

25|$|Ronald Hamilton {{suggested}} in his paper The Silent Fire: ODAP {{and the death}} of Christopher McCandless that itinerant traveler Christopher McCandless may have died from starvation after being unable to hunt or gather food due to lathyrism induced paralysis of his legs caused by eating the seeds of Hedysarum alpinum. In 2014, a preliminary lab analysis indicated that the seeds did contain ODAP. However, a more detailed mass <b>spectrometric</b> <b>analysis</b> conclusively ruled out ODAP and lathyrism.

40|$|International audienceMass {{spectrometry}} based {{analysis of}} proteins {{is widely used}} to study cellular processes in model organisms. However, {{it has not yet}} routinely been applied in environmental research. Based on observations that protein can readily be detected as a component of dissolved organic matter (DOM), this article gives an example about the possible use of protein analysis in ecology and environmental sciences focusing on different terrestrial ecosystems. At this stage, there are two areas of interest: (1) the identification of phylogenetic groups contributing to the DOM protein pool, and (2) identification of the organismic origin of specific enzymes that are important for ecosystem processes. In this paper, mass <b>spectrometric</b> protein <b>analysis</b> was applied to identify proteins from DOM and organism-free surface water samples derived from different environments. It is concluded, that mass <b>spectrometric</b> protein <b>analysis</b> is capable of distinguishing phylogenetic origin of proteins from leachates of different soil horizons, and from various sources of terrestrial surface water. Current limitation is imposed by the limited knowledge of complete genomes of soil organisms. The protein analysis allows to relate protein presence to biogeochemical processes, and to identify the source organisms for specific active enzymes. Further applications, such as in pollution research are conceivable. In summary, the analysis of proteins opens a new area of research between the fields of microbiology and biogeochemistry...|$|R

50|$|The mass <b>spectrometric</b> <b>analysis</b> {{produces}} {{a list of}} molecular weights of the fragments which is often called a peak list. The peptide masses are compared to protein databases such as Swissprot, which contain protein sequence information. Software performs in silico digests on proteins in the database with the same enzyme (e.g. trypsin) used in the chemical cleavage reaction. The mass of these peptide fragments is then calculated and compared to the peak list of measured peptide masses. The results are statistically analyzed and possible matches are returned in a results table.|$|E
50|$|Reduction and {{alkylation}} of cysteine residues improves peptide {{yield and}} sequence coverage and {{the identification of}} proteins with {{a high number of}} disulfide bonds. Due to the rareness of the amino acid cysteine for most of the proteins the step of r&a does not effect any improvement of the mass <b>spectrometric</b> <b>analysis.</b> For the quantitative and homogeneous alkylation of cysteines the position of the modification step in the sample-preparation process is crucial. With denaturing electrophoresis it is strongly recommended to perform the reaction before the execution of the electrophoresis, since there are free acrylamide monomers in the gel able to modify cysteine residues irreversibly. The resulting acrylamide adducts have a molecular weight of 174.05 Da.|$|E
50|$|Electron-capture {{dissociation}} (ECD) {{was developed}} in 1998 to fragment large proteins for mass <b>spectrometric</b> <b>analysis.</b> Because ECD requires {{a large amount of}} near-thermal electrons (<0.2eV), originally it was used exclusively with Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR), the most expensive form of MS instrumentation. Less costly options such as quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF), quadrupole ion trap (QIT) and linear quadrupole ion trap (QLT) instruments used the more energy-intensive collision-induced dissociation method (CID), resulting in random fragmentation of peptides and proteins. In 2004 Syka et al. announced the creation of ETD, a dissociation method similar to ECD, but using a low-cost, widely available commercial spectrometer. The first ETD experiments were run on a QLT mass spectrometer with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source.|$|E
