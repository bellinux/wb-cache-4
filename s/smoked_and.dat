5|$|Cigarette {{smoking is}} the best-established avoidable {{risk factor for}} {{pancreatic}} cancer, approximately doubling risk among long-term smokers, the risk increasing {{with the number of}} cigarettes <b>smoked</b> <b>and</b> the years of smoking. The risk declines slowly after smoking cessation, taking some 20 years to return to almost that of non-smokers.|$|E
5|$|Intense and {{prolonged}} exposure to workplace dusts, chemicals and fumes {{increase the risk}} of COPD in both smokers and nonsmokers. Workplace exposures are believed to be the cause in 10–20% of cases. In the United States they are believed to be related to more than 30% of cases among those who have never <b>smoked</b> <b>and</b> probably represent a greater risk in countries without sufficient regulations.|$|E

40|$|Alcohol use {{disorders}} {{are associated with}} increased lung infections and exacerbations of chronic lung diseases. Whereas the effects of cigarette smoke are well recognized, the interplay of <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> alcohol in modulating lung diseases is not clear. Because innate lung defense is mechanically maintained by airway cilia action and protein kinase C (PKC) -activating agents slow ciliary beat frequency (CBF), we hypothesized {{that the combination of}} <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> alcohol would decrease CBF in a PKC-dependent manner. Primary ciliated bronchial epithelial cells were exposed to 5 % cigarette smoke extract plus 100 mmol/L ethanol for up to 24 hours and assayed for CBF <b>and</b> PKCε. <b>Smoke</b> <b>and</b> alcohol co-exposure activated PKCε by 1 hour and decreased both CBF and total number of beating cilia by 6 hours. A specific activator of PKCε, DCP-LA, slowed CBF after maximal PKCε activation. Interestingly, activation of PKCε by <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> alcohol was only observed in ciliated cells, not basal bronchial epithelium. In precision-cut mouse lung slices treated with <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> alcohol, PKCε activation preceded CBF slowing. Correspondingly, increased PKCε activity and cilia slowing were only observed in mice co-exposed to <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> alcohol, regardless of the sequence of the combination exposure. No decreases in CBF were observed in PKCε knockout mice co-exposed to <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> alcohol. These data identify PKCε as a key regulator of cilia slowing in response to combined <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> alcohol-induced lung injury...|$|R

5|$|Linezolid is a weak {{monoamine oxidase}} {{inhibitor}} (MAOI), {{and should not}} be used concomitantly with other MAOIs, large amounts of tyramine-rich foods (such as pork, aged cheeses, alcoholic beverages, or <b>smoked</b> <b>and</b> pickled foods), or serotonergic drugs. There have been postmarketing reports of serotonin syndrome when linezolid was given with or soon after the discontinuation of serotonergic drugs, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as paroxetine and sertraline. It may also enhance the blood pressure-increasing effects of sympathomimetic drugs such as pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine. It should also not be given in combination with pethidine (meperidine) under any circumstance due to the risk of serotonin syndrome.|$|E

She was admired for her fashion sense, having imported all of her clothing from Paris. Charlotte also <b>smoked</b> <b>and</b> drank, and was liked by many for hosting entertaining parties. She earned a reputation as a gossip, and many found her acid-tongued; she was known for befriending someone and earning their confidence, only to spread their secrets to others.|$|E
5|$|Disillusioned with Covent Garden, MacMillan {{accepted}} {{an invitation from}} the Deutsche Oper in Berlin to run its ballet company. Parry describes this as an unhappy experience. Though at Covent Garden Webster may sometimes have been suspected of favouring the opera {{at the expense of}} the ballet, MacMillan discovered that at the Berlin house there was no doubt that the ballet was given distinctly lower priority. He did not speak German, which reduced his enjoyment from watching films (of which he was a great devotee) and theatre and limited him generally in everyday life. Although he had taken several colleagues with him, including Seymour, many moved away over the course of his nearly four years in charge, and MacMillan became increasingly isolated. It was the first time he had been in a managerial as well as a creative role, and the strain affected his physical and mental health. He <b>smoked</b> <b>and</b> drank heavily and suffered a minor stroke.|$|E
5|$|The <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> {{airborne}} particulates from the fires posed {{a threat to}} local communities on several occasions. <b>Smoke</b> <b>and</b> particulates were especially high in Gardiner, Montana. There, monitoring stations maintained by the Montana Department of Health and Environmental Sciences and the park recorded 19 days where recommended allowable particulate concentrations were exceeded. This was also the case near fires, and on 7 occasions at Mammoth, Montana, {{the location of the}} park headquarters. In no other surrounding communities were particulates found to be above acceptable levels. <b>Smoke</b> <b>and</b> haze made driving difficult and sometimes even dangerous. A number of fire fighters were treated at clinics for <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> dust inhalation and a few for inadvertently inhaling fumes from a sulfur ignition near one of the geothermal areas.|$|R

5|$|Puffins {{have been}} hunted by man since time immemorial. Coastal {{communities}} and island dwellers with few natural resources at their disposal, made {{good use of}} the seafoods that they found on their cliffs and shores. Puffins were caught and eaten fresh, salted in brine or <b>smoked</b> <b>and</b> dried. Their feathers were used in bedding and their eggs were eaten, {{but not to the}} same extent as those of some other seabirds, being more difficult to extract from the nest. In most countries, Atlantic puffins are now protected by legislation, and in the countries where hunting is still permitted, strict laws prevent over-exploitation. They are still caught and eaten in Iceland and the Faroe Islands, but there have been calls for an outright ban on hunting them in Iceland because of concern over the dwindling number of birds successfully raising chicks.|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which cigarette smoking and asbestos exposure synergistically increase the incidence of lung cancer is unknown. We hypothesized that cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> asbestos might synergistically increase DNA damage. To test this hypothesis we exposed isolated bacteriophage PM 2 DNA to cigarette <b>smoke</b> and/or asbestos, <b>and</b> assessed DNA strand breaks as an index of DNA damage. Our results supported our hypothesis. 78 +/- 12 % of the DNA exposed to both cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> asbestos developed strand breaks, while only 9. 8 +/- 7. 0 or 4. 3 +/- 3. 3 % of the DNA exposed to cigarette smoke or asbestos, respectively, developed strand breaks under {{the conditions of the}} experiment. Our experimental evidence suggested that cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> asbestos synergistically increased DNA damage by stimulating. OH formation. First, significant amounts of. OH were detected by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) in DNA mixtures containing both cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> asbestos, but no. OH was detected in mixtures containing cigarette smoke alone or asbestos alone. Second, the. OH scavengers, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), mannitol, or Na benzoate decreased both. OH detection by EPR and strand breaks in DNA mixtures exposed to cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> asbestos. Third, the H 2 O 2 scavenger, catalase, and the iron chelators, 1, 10 -phenanthroline and desferrithiocin, decreased both. OH detection and strand breaks in DNA mixtures exposed to cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> asbestos. These latter findings suggest that iron contained in asbestos may catalyze the formation of. OH from H 2 O 2 generated by cigarette smoke. In summary, our study indicates that cigarette <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> asbestos synergistically increase DNA damage and suggests that this synergism may involve. OH production...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} common rail system's {{injection}} timing and rail pressure on high-power diesel's fuel economy and emission characteristics {{has been studied}} through tests. The experimental results show that with the rail pressure increasing, fuel economy <b>and</b> <b>smoke</b> are improving, while NOx is deteriorating. However, as rail pressure very high, the improving trends of <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> fuel economy are not obvious terribly, and even at low load condition, the economy will decline instead.

40|$|In {{order to}} control the <b>smoke</b> {{diffusing}} <b>and</b> prevent {{the damage to the}} people, the smoke temperature was researched. In high-rise building fires, the most immediate threat to passengers’ life is not the direct exposure to fire but the smoke inhalation because it contains hot air and toxic gases, so it has positive meaning to find the rules of the smoke temperature distribution. The variable rule of smoke temperature field distribution in passages of high-rise building was the foundation of fire fighting project. Heat-transfer process between <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> building walls was analyzed by establishing difference equation of heat balance and diffusion process between <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> transverse passage of high-rise building was analyzed by mathematical model of air mixed with smoke. The variable rule of smoke temperature, diffusion time and length of exit passageway was analyzed by case. Smoke temperature variation in smoke diffusion process was affected mainly by generation quantity of <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> less affected by heat-transfer process between <b>smoke</b> <b>and</b> building walls...|$|R
