40|$|AbstractThe {{traditional}} <b>squealer</b> <b>tip</b> of {{turbine blade}} performs good property in decreasing the leakage mass flow rate. The {{improvement of the}} aerodynamic performance for turbine blade tip is always continuing associated with {{the understanding of the}} leakage flowcharacteristic. Thus, a novel turbine blade tip, which is derived from the conventional <b>squealer</b> <b>tip,</b> is investigated numerically in this paper. The characteristic of the tipregion flow field, the tip blade loading distribution and the tip leakage mass flow is analyzed in detail. The results show that, first some part of the tip region flowsare forced to flow downstream along the guided groove formed by the recessed pressure side rim, which contributes to the preventing of the leakage mass flow and the descending of leakage loss as well. Besides,the blade loading of the novel geometry is raised than the traditional <b>squealer</b> <b>tip,</b> which reveals that the mass flow rate of the working fluid is increased. Third, the leakage mass flow is reduced so that the efficiency is increased. The CFD analysis predictsthat, the novel <b>squealer</b> <b>tip</b> case shows 30 % less leakage mass flow and a 0. 11 % total isentropic efficiency increase for a single rotor compared to the baseline <b>squealer</b> <b>tip</b> case...|$|E
40|$|The tips of {{gas turbine}} rotor blade {{experience}} large thermal loads, {{which can lead}} to tip damage. The large thermal loads on the tips of rotor blade are due to the hot leakage flow through the gap between rotating blade tip and stationary shroud. The hot leakage flow accelerates due to the large pressure difference between the pressure and suction sides of blade, resulting a thin boundary layer and high heat transfer rates. The flow across the blade tip is also undesirable from the perspective of efficiency since it increases the loss of turbine power. For this reason, squlealer-type tip is used to reduce the leakage flow. Rim and groove increase the flow resistance of the leakage flow, resulting decrease of the leakage flow rate. However, the thermal loads and stresses are concentrated in the tip edge of rotor blade and occur crack and breakage. Therefore, {{it is very important to}} understand the heat transfer characteristics on surfaces inside the cavity of the <b>squealer</b> <b>tip,</b> such as tip surface and inner rim surface. Kwak et al. [1] measured detailed heat transfer coefficients on the <b>squealer</b> <b>tip</b> compare with flat tip. Tips with single/double rim type were studied at the pressure side, suction side, camber line using transient liquid crystals technique (TLC). Goldstein et al.

40|$|Due to the {{pressure}} difference between the blade pressure and suction side, hot gas leaks through {{the gap between the}} blade tip and the shroud. This flow, called leakage flow, causes thin bound-ary layer and high heat transfer coefficient on the blade tip. The hot leakage flow is the major cause of blade tip failures. To reduce the leakage flow and heat transfer on the tip, the blades of modern gas turbines typically have a recessed cavity at the tip and are called <b>squealer</b> <b>tip</b> blades. The cavity acts as a labyrinth seal to increase flow resistance and thus reduces leakage flow. Recently, many experimental studies for the <b>squealer</b> <b>tip</b> blade have been conducted in a cascade environment. Azad et al...|$|E
40|$|An {{effort is}} made to numerically study the impact of {{rotating}} turbine conditions on the aerodynamic performance, film cooling effectiveness and heat transfer with {{the application of the}} endwall contouring and blade tip ejection. For this purpose, the three-stage HP turbine research facility at the Turbomachinery Performance and Flow Research Laboratory (TPFL), Texas A&M University, was newly designed and equipped. Using the geometry of this three-stage research turbine rig, comprehensive numerical simulations are performed to systematically study the impact of the rotation from the perspectives of both aerodynamics and heat transfer. Introducing endwall contouring has become a promising means to reduce the secondary flow losses. Thus TPFL developed a physics-based method which enables researchers and engineers to design endwall contours for any arbitrary blade types regardless of the blade loading, degree of reaction, stage load and flow coefficients. Using this approach, TPFL designed the new endwall contouring which was implemented on the platform of both the first-stage and second-stage rotors. The rotation impacts on the aerodynamics performance due to the endwall contouring were numerically studied using four different rotational speeds namely, 2000 rpm, 2400 rpm, 2600 rpm and 3000 rpm. Meanwhile, the influence on film cooling effectiveness and heat transfer caused by the endwall contouring was investigated for the first-stage rotor. Different purge-to-mainstream mass flow ratios of MFR = 0. 5 %, 1. 0 % and 1. 5 % were taken into account at the design rotational speed of 3000 rpm. The effect of rotational speed (2400 rpm, 2550 rpm and 3000 rpm) was investigated at typical MFR= 1. 0 %. To investigate the flow characteristics and film cooling at high pressure turbine blade tips, four different rotor-blade tip configurations are designed and studied at TPFL: the plane and <b>squealer</b> <b>tips</b> with tip hole cooling and the plane and <b>squealer</b> <b>tips</b> with pressure-side-edge compound angle hole cooling. Seven perpendicular holes that are evenly distributed along the camber line are used for the tip hole cooling, whilst eight compound-angle holes for the pressure-side-edge cooling. The coolant was ejected through the cooling holes with low, medium and high global blowing ratios at 3000 rpm to study the impact of the blowing ratio on both the cooling effectiveness and heat transfer. Effects of rotation on the cooling effectiveness and heat transfer were calculated at the rotational speeds of 2000 rpm, 2550 rpm, and 3000 rpm...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} an {{experimental}} investigation of aerodynamic characteristics of full and partial-length squealer rims in a turbine stage. Full and partial-length squealer rims are investigated separately on the pressure side {{and on the}} suction side in the “Axial Flow Turbine Research Facility ” (AFTRF) of the Pennsylvania State University. The streamwise length of these “partial <b>squealer</b> <b>tips</b> ” and their chordwise position are varied to find an optimal aerodynamic tip configuration. The optimal configuration in this cold turbine study {{is defined as the}} one that is minimizing the stage exit total pressure defect in the tip vortex dominated zone. A new “channel arrangement ” diverting some of the leakage flow into the trailing edge zone is also studied. Current results indicate that the use of “partial squealer rims ” in axial flow turbines can positively affect the local aerodynamic field by weakening the tip leakage vortex. Results also show that the suction side partial squealers are aerodynamically superior to the pressure side squealers and the channel arrangement.

40|$|The thermal {{performance}} of the three turbine tips was investigated. The results are presented in terms of heattransfer coefficient (h), cooling effectiveness (η), net heat-flux reduction (NHFR), and heat load. The calculations were performed using a cooled flat tip, a cooled cavity tip, and a cooled suction-side <b>squealer</b> <b>tip</b> in a cascade at a tip gap of 1. 6 %C. The results were validated using experimental data where possible. For an uncooled flat tip, the fluid dynamics are dominated by flow separation at the pressure-side edge. A significant benefit of ejecting coolant inside this separation bubble is shown. At the coolant mass-flow ratio M c = 0 : 52 %, both the cooled flat tip and the cooled cavity tip are well-protected by the coolant. For the cooled suction-side <b>squealer</b> <b>tip,</b> the coolant lifts off from the tip floor and leads to not only low cooling effectiveness, but also to high heat-transfer coefficients.

40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} are performed {{to measure the}} detailed heat transfer coefficient and static pressure distributions on the <b>squealer</b> <b>tip</b> of a gas turbine blade in a five-bladed stationary linear cascade. The blade is a 2 -dimensional model of a modem first stage gas turbine rotor blade with a blade tip profile of a GE-E(sup 3) aircraft gas turbine engine rotor blade. A squealer (recessed) tip with a 3. 77 % recess is considered here. The data on the <b>squealer</b> <b>tip</b> are also compared with a flat tip case. All measurements are made at three different tip gap clearances of about 1 %, 1. 5 %, and 2. 5 % of the blade span. Two different turbulence intensities of 6. 1 % and 9. 7 % at the cascade inlet are also considered for heat transfer measurements. Static pressure measurements {{are made in the}} mid-span and near-tip regions, {{as well as on the}} shroud surface opposite to the blade tip surface. The flow condition in the test cascade corresponds to an overall pressure ratio of 1. 32 and an exit Reynolds number based on the axial chord of 1. 1 x 10 (exp 6). A transient liquid crystal technique is used to measure the heat transfer coefficients. Results show that the heat transfer coefficient on the cavity surface and rim increases with an increase in tip clearance. 'Me heat transfer coefficient on the rim is higher than the cavity surface. The cavity surface has a higher heat transfer coefficient near the leading edge region than the trailing edge region. The heat transfer coefficient on the pressure side rim and trailing edge region is higher at a higher turbulence intensity level of 9. 7 % over 6. 1 % case. However, no significant difference in local heat transfer coefficient is observed inside the cavity and the suction side rim for the two turbulence intensities.

40|$|Contours of heat {{transfer}} coefficient and effectiveness have been measured {{on the tip of}} a generic cooled turbine blade, using the transient liquid crystal technique. The experiments were conducted at an exit Reynolds number of 2. 3 x 10 (5) in a five-blade linear cascade with tip clearances of 1. 6 % and 2. 8 % chord and featuring engine-representative cooling geometries. These experiments were supported by oil-flow visualization and pressure measurements on the tip and casing and by flow visualization calculated using CFX, all of which provided insight into the fluid dynamics within the gap. The data were compared with measurements taken from the uncooled tip gap, where the fluid dynamics is dominated by flow separation at the pressure-side edge. Here, the highest levels of {{heat transfer}} are located where the flow reattaches on the tip surface downstream of the separation bubble. A quantitative assessment using the net heat flux reduction (NHFR) revealed a significant benefit of ejecting coolant inside this separation bubble. Engine-representative blowing rates of approximately 0. 6 - 0. 8 resulted in good film-cooling coverage and a reduction in heat flux to the tip when compared to both the flat tip profile and the <b>squealer</b> and cavity <b>tip</b> geometries discussed in Part I of this paper Of the two novel coolant-hole configurations studied, injecting the coolant inside the separation bubble resulted in an improved NHFR when compared to injecting coolant at the location of reattachment...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation has}} been performed to measure average and local mass transfer coefficients {{on the tip}} of a gas turbine blade using the naphthalene sublimation technique. The heat/mass transfer analogy can be applied to obtain heat transfer coefficients from the measured mass transfer data. Flow visualization on the tip surface is provided using an oil dot technique. Two different tip geometries are considered: a <b>squealer</b> <b>tip</b> and a winglet-squealer tip having a winglet on the pressure side and a squealer on the suction side of the blade. Measurements have been taken at tip clearance levels ranging from 0. 6 % to 3. 6 % of actual chord. The exit Reynolds number based on actual chord is approximately 7. 2 × 105 for all measurements. Flow visualization shows impingement and recirculation regions on the blade tip surface, providing an interpretation of the mass transfer distributions and offering insight into the fluid dynamics within the gap. For both tip geometries the tip clearance level has a significant effect on the mass transfer distribution.

For the <b>squealer</b> <b>tip,</b> {{the depth of the}} cavity is fixed but the rim width varies to form a wide cavity, which can decrease the coolant momentum and the tip leakage flow velocity. This cavity contributes to the improvement of the cooling effect in the tip zone. To investigate the influence on the tip heat transfer by the rim width, numerical simulations were performed as a two-part study: (1) unequal rim width study on the pressure side and the suction side and (2) equal rim width study with rim widths of 0. 58 %, 1. 16 %, and 1. 74 % of the axial chord (0. 5 mm, 1 mm, and 1. 5 mm, respectively) on both the pressure side rim and the suction side rim. With different rim widths, the effect of different global blowing ratios, i. e., M = 0. 5, 1. 0 and 1. 5, was investigated.

A SDBD plasma actuator and a passive partial suction-side squealer were tested over a Reynolds number range from 5. 3 × 104 to 1. 03 × 105 at a fixed tip clearance of 2. 18 percent of axial chord. The plasma actuator was designed to mimic the beneficial effects of the suction-side <b>squealer</b> <b>tip,</b> while removing the negative aspects of the passive squealer design, including blade degradation flow recirculation or potential blade-wall contact. The flowfield was documented with five-hole-probe measurements at 1 axial chord downstream of the test blade and within the clearance using wall pressure taps located on the endwall opposite the blade tip. These tests allowed the loss associated with the flow and the change in this loss with applied flow control to be recorded. The plasma actuator caused an improvement in the downstream flow, with {{a reduction in the}} total pressure loss coefficient within the tip leakage vortex ranging between 2 % to 12 %, depending on Reynolds number, while the passive squealer showed a change of approximately 40 %. On the endwall within the clearance, the plasma actuator generated a 19 % peak increase in wall static pressure while the passive squealer caused a maximum increase of 52 %. These results show that the plasma actuator was able to favorably mitigate the adverse effects of the tip clearance flow in a similar manner as the <b>squealer</b> <b>tip,</b> without the drawbacks of the passive squealer method...|$|E

40|$|The tips of unshrouded, {{high-pressure}} turbine blades {{are prone to}} significantly high heat loads. The gap between the tip and over-tip casing is {{the root cause of}} undesirable over-tip leakage flow that is directly responsible for high thermal material degradation and is a major source of aerodynamic loss within a turbine. Both must be minimised for the safe working and improved performance of future gas-turbines. A joint experimental and numerical study is presented to understand and characterise the heat transfer and aerodynamics of unshrouded blade tips. The investigation is undertaken {{with the use of a}} squealer or cavity tip design, known for oâµering the best overall compromise between the tip aerodynamics, heat transfer and mechanical stress. Since there is a lack of understanding of these tips at engine-realistic conditions, the present study comprises of a detailed analysis using a high-speed linear cascade and computational simulations. The aero-thermal performance is studied to provide a better insight into the behaviour of squealer tips, the eâµects of casing movement and tip cooling. The linear cascade environment has proved beneficial for its oâµering of spatially-resolved data maps and its ability to validate computational results. Due to the unknown tip gap height within an entire engine cycle, the eâµects of gap height are assessed. The squealer's aero-thermal performance has been shown to be linked with the gap height, and qualitative different trends in heat transfer are established between low-speed and high-speed tip flow regimes. To the author's knowledge, the present work is the first of its kind, providing comprehensive aero-thermal experimental research and a dataset for a <b>squealer</b> <b>tip</b> at engine-representative transonic conditions.

Tip clearance levels ranged from 0. 56 % to 1. 68 % design span or equally from 1 % to 3 % of blade chord. An infrared camera, looking through the hollow blade, made detailed temperature measurements on a constant heat flux tip surface. The relative motion between the endwall and the blade tip was simulated by a moving belt. The moving belt endwall significantly to shifts the region of high Nusselt number distribution and reduces the overall averaged Nusselt number on the tip surface by up to 13. 3 %.

40|$|Very limited {{experimental}} data {{is available for}} aerodynamic and film cooling effectiveness under rotating condition in the literature. As a result, {{there is a strong}} need to study in detail and discover essential features of turbine platform and blade tip film cooling under engine representative flow and rotating conditions. This dissertation deals with the specific heat transfer and aerodynamics problematic inherent to high pressure (HP) turbine sections. Major efficiency improvement has been achieved by introducing a completely new endwall contouring technology which decreases the strength of the secondary flow vortices. Efficiency measurements show for the contoured rotor a maximum efficiency of 89. 9 % compared to the reference non-contoured case of nt-s = 88. 86 %. This is an efficiency increase of nt-s = 1. 04 %. The new method of endwall contouring not only has improved the turbine aerodynamic efficiency but it also has substantially improved the film cooling effectiveness of the contoured endwall. The film cooling experiments were carried out using pressure sensitive paint (PSP) measurement technique. Measurements were conducted for three coolant-to-mainstream mass flow ratios (MFR) of 0. 5 %, 1. 0 % and 1. 5 %. Film cooling data is also obtained for three rotational speeds, 3000 rpm (reference condition), 2550 rpm and 2400 rpm and they are compared with non-contoured endwall data. For 3000 rpm two more coolant to mainstream mass flow ratio of 0. 75 % and 1. 25 % are performed to have a better view of how film cooling effectiveness is changing. Comparing experimental results of the film cooling effectiveness investigations of the contoured case with the reference non-contoured case, clearly shows the improving effect of contouring on film cooling effectiveness for all cases investigated in this report. Four different blade tip ejection configurations were utilized to determine the impact of the hole arrangements on the film cooling effectiveness: plane tip with tip hole cooling, <b>squealer</b> <b>tip</b> with tip hole cooling, plane tip with pressure-side-edge compound angle hole cooling and <b>squealer</b> <b>tip</b> with pressure-side-edge compound angle hole cooling. To avoid rotor imbalance, every pair is installed radially. Film cooling effectiveness measurements were performed for three blowing ratios (M) of 0. 75, 1. 25 and 1. 75. Film cooling data was also obtained for three rotational speeds; 3000 rpm (reference condition), 2550 rpm and 2000 rpm.

40|$|The inlet {{temperature}} of modern gas turbine engines has been increased to achieve higher thermal efficiency and increased output. The blade edge regions, including the blade tip, the leading edge, and the platform, {{are exposed to}} the most extreme heat loads, and therefore, must be adequately cooled to maintain safety. For the blade tip, there is tip leakage flow due to the pressure gradient across the tip. This leakage flow not only reduces the blade aerodynamic performance, but also yields a high heat load due to the thin boundary layer and high speed. Various tip configurations, such as plane tip, double side <b>squealer</b> <b>tip,</b> and single suction side <b>squealer</b> <b>tip,</b> have been studied to find which one is the best configuration to reduce the tip leakage flow and the heat load. In addition to the flow and heat transfer on the blade tip, film cooling with various arrangements, including camber line, upstream, and two row configurations, have been studied. Besides these cases of low inlet/outlet pressure ratio, low temperature, non-rotating, the high inlet/outlet pressure ratio, high temperature, and rotating cases have been investigated, since they are closer to real turbine working conditions. The leading edge of the rotor blade experiences high heat transfer because of the stagnation flow. Film cooling on the rotor leading edge in a 1 - 1 / 2 turbine stage has been numerically studied for the design and off-design conditions. Simulations find that the increasing rotating speed shifts the stagnation line from the pressure side, to the leading edge and the suction side, while film cooling protection moves in the reverse direction with decreasing cooling effectiveness. Film cooling brings a high unsteady intensity of the heat transfer coefficient, especially on the suction side. The unsteady intensity of film cooling effectiveness is higher than that of the heat transfer coefficient. The film cooling on the rotor platform has gained significant attention due to the usage of low-aspect ratio and low-solidity turbine designs. Film cooling and its heat transfer are strongly influenced by the secondary flow of the end-wall and the stator-rotor interaction. Numerical predictions have been performed for the film cooling on the rotating platform of a whole turbine stage. The design conditions yield a high cooling effectiveness and decrease the cooling effectiveness unsteady intensity, while the high rpm condition dramatically reduces the film cooling effectiveness. High purge flow rates provide a better cooling protection. In addition, the impact of the turbine work process on film cooling effectiveness and heat transfer coefficient has been investigated. The overall cooling effectiveness shows a higher value than the adiabatic effectiveness does...|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study has}} been conducted to explore {{the effect of a}} pressure-side winglet on the flow and heat transfer over a blade tip.

For the flat tip, the pressure-side winglet exhibits a significant reduction in the leakage flow strength. The low heat transfer coefficient &# 8220;sweet-spot&# 8221; region is larger with the pressure-side winglet, and lower heat transfer coefficients are also observed along the pressure side of the blade. For the flat tip, the winglet reduces the heat transfer coefficient locally by as much as 30 %, while the average heat transfer coefficient is reduced by about 7 %. In the presence of a squealer, the role of the winglet decreases significantly, and a 5 % reduction in the pressure loss coefficient is achieved with the winglet with virtually no reduction in the average heat transfer coefficient. On the other hand, the suction-side squealer with constant width winglet shows lower heat transfer (reduction of 5. 5 %) and pressure loss coefficient (reduction of 26 %) than its baseline counterpart. </p...|$|E

Relative casing movement effects are then evaluated for two tip configurations at three different tip gaps. The moving casing is shown to affect the aerothermal performance considerably; the trends are consistently captured for the large and medium tip gaps, both in the stationary and moving casing instances. Presented results confirm that, even with a moving casing, the blade tips remain transonic. It is also shown that the heat transfer is not only dependent on the tip gap size but also the tip-geometry configuration.

The study {{is divided into two}} sections; in the first, computational simulations of a very large scale, low speed linear cascade with a flat blade tip were conducted. These simulations were validated against experimental data collected by Palafox (2006). A thorough assessment of turbulence models and minimum meshing requirements was performed. The standard k-ω and standard k-ϵ turbulence models significantly overpredicted the turbulence levels within the tip gap. The other models were very similar in performance; the SST k-ω and realisable k-ϵ models were found to be the most suitable for the flow environment. The second section documents the development and testing of a novel hybrid blade tip design, the squealet tip, which seeks to combine the known benefits of winglet and double squealer tips. The development of the external geometry was performed primarily through engine-representative CFD simulations at a range of tip gaps from 0. 45 % to 1. 34 % blade chord. The squealet tip was found to have a similar aerodynamic sensitivity to tip clearance as a baseline double <b>squealer</b> <b>tip,</b> with a tip gap efficiency exchange rate of 2. 03, although this was 18 % greater than the alternative winglet tip. The squealet tip displayed higher predicted stage efficiency than the winglet tip over the majority of the range of tip clearances investigated, however. The overall heat load was reduced by 14 % compared with the winglet tip but increased by 28 % over the double <b>squealer</b> <b>tip,</b> primarily due to the change in wetted surface area. The predicted local heat transfer coefficients were similar across all geometries. A realistic internal cooling plenum and an array of blade tip cooling holes were subsequently added to the squealet tip geometry and the cooling configuration refined by the selective sealing of cooling holes. Film cooling performance was largely assessed by the predicted adiabatic wall temperature distributions. A viable cooling scheme which reduced the cooling air requirement by 38 % was achieved, compared to the initial case which had all cooling holes open. This was associated with just a 7 % increase in blade tip heat flux and no penalty in peak temperature on the blade tip. Film cooling air ejected from holes on the blade suction side was swept away from the blade tip region, making the squealet rim at the crown of the blade particularly challenging to cool. It was demonstrated that this region could be cooled effectively by ballistic cooling from holes located on the blade tip cavity floor, although this was expensive in terms of the mass flow rate of cooling air required. The computational results were reinforced with experimental data collected in a transonic linear cascade. Downstream aerodynamic loss measurements were taken for a linearised version of the squealet tip design without cooling at nominal tip gaps of 0. 45 %, 0. 89 % and 1. 34 % blade chord, which was compared to similar data taken by O’Dowd (2010) for flat and winglet tips. The squealet was seen to have a similar aerodynamic loss to the flat tip and a reduced loss compared with the winglet tip. Full surface heat transfer measurements were taken for the uncooled squealet tip, at tip gaps of 0. 89 % and 1. 34 % blade chord, and for two configurations of the cooled squealet tip, at a tip clearance of 0. 89 % blade chord. The qualitative similarity between the measured heat transfer distributions and the those predicted by the engine-representative CFD simulations was good. A CFD simulation of the uncooled linear cascade environment at the 1. 34 % blade chord tip clearance was performed using a single blade with translationally periodic boundary conditions. The predicted size of the over-tip leakage vortex was smaller than had been measured, resulting in a large underprediction in the magnitude of the downstream area-averaged aerodynamic loss. The magnitudes of the predicted blade tip Nusselt number distribution were similar to those produced by the engine-representative CFD simulations and lower than that measured experimentally. Differences {{in the shape of the}} Nusselt number distribution were observed in the vicinity of regions of separated and reattaching flow, but other salient features were replicated in the computational data. The squealet tip has been shown to be a promising, viable unshrouded blade tip design with an aerodynamic performance similar to the double <b>squealer</b> <b>tip</b> but is more amenable to film cooling. It is significantly lighter than a winglet tip and incurs a reduced thermal load. The squealet tip design can now be developed into a blade tip geometry for use in real engines to provide an alternative to shrouded turbine blades and current unshrouded blade tip designs. A commercial CFD solver, Fluent 6. 3, was shown to capture blade tip heat transfer and over-tip leakage flow sufficiently well to be a useful design guide. However, the sensitivity of the flow structure (and hence, heat transfer) in the forward part of the blade tip cavity suggests that physical testing cannot be eliminated from the design process entirely.

40|$|An {{experimental}} and numerical {{investigation into the}} tip leakage flow of a turbine rotor is carried out using a particle image velocimetry (PIV) system and the commercial software ANSYS CFX 14. 0. The specimen used in this work is a typical GE-E 3 model with a new <b>squealer</b> <b>tip</b> design. The experimental data are {{used to create a}} turbulence model and numerical strategy. Through the validated turbulence model and numerical strategy, simulations are carried out to compare the characteristics of the tip leakage flow in three cases: (1) the blade is rotating, but the shroud is stationary, which is the real status of turbine rotor operation; (2) the blade is stationary, but the shroud moves, to simulate their relative movement; (3) the blade is stationary, and the shroud is also stationary, this is a simplified case, but has been widely used in the experiments on rotor tip leakage flow. Detailed analysis of the flow phenomena shows that the second case is a reasonable alternative approach to simulate the real state. However, the flow patterns in the third case exhibit some evident differences from the real status. These differences are caused by the inaccurate viscous force arising from the stationary blade and shroud. In this work, a modification method for the experiments conducted in the third case is firstly proposed, which is realized through adding an imaginary roughness at the shroud wall to be close to the real viscous effect, and to thereby reduce the deviation of the experiment from the real case. According to the results calculated by ANSYS CFX, the flow structure in the modification case is very close to the real status. Besides, this modification case is an easy and cheap way to simulate the real tip leakage flow...|$|E
40|$|Detailed {{film cooling}} {{effectiveness}} distributions were measured on the stationary blade tip {{and on the}} leading edge region of a rotating blade using a Pressure Sensitive Paint technique. Air and nitrogen gas were used as the film cooling gases and the oxygen concentration distribution for each case was measured. The film cooling effectiveness information was obtained from the difference of the oxygen concentration between air and nitrogen gas cases by applying the mass transfer analogy. In the case of the stationary blade tip, plane tip and <b>squealer</b> <b>tip</b> blades were used while the film cooling holes were located (a) along the camber line on the tip or (b) along the span of the pressure side. The average blowing ratio of the cooling gas was controlled to be 0. 5, 1. 0, and 2. 0. Tests were conducted in a five-bladed linear cascade with a blow down facility. The free stream Reynolds number, based on the axial chord length and the exit velocity, was 1, 100, 000 and the inlet and the exit Mach number were 0. 25 and 0. 59, respectively. Turbulence intensity level at the cascade inlet was 9. 7 %. All measurements were made at three different tip gap clearances of 1 %, 1. 5 %, and 2. 5 % of blade span. Results show that the locations of the film cooling holes and the presence of squealer have significant effects on surface static pressure and film-cooling effectiveness. Same technique was applied to the rotating turbine blade leading edge region. Tests were conducted on the first stage rotor of a 3 -stage axial turbine. The Reynolds number based on the axial chord length and the exit velocity was 200, 000 and the total to exit pressure ratio was 1. 12 for the first rotor. The effects of the rotational speed and the blowing ratio were studied. The rotational speed was controlled to be 2400, 2550, and 3000 rpm and the blowing ratio was 0. 5, 1. 0, and 2. 0. Two different film cooling hole geometries were used; 2 -row and 3 -row film cooling holes. Results show that the rotational speed changes the directions of the coolant flows. Blowing ratio also changes the distributions of the coolant flows. The results of this study will be helpful in understanding the physical phenomena regarding the film injection and designing more efficient turbine blades...|$|E
