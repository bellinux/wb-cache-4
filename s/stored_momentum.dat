50|$|Over time, {{reaction}} wheels may {{build up}} <b>stored</b> <b>momentum</b> {{that needs to}} be cancelled. Designers therefore supplement reaction wheel systems with other attitude control mechanisms. In the presence of a magnetic field (as in low Earth orbit), a spacecraft can employ magnetorquers (better known as torque rods) to transfer angular momentum to the Earth through its planetary magnetic field. In the absence of a magnetic field, the most efficient practice is to use either high-efficiency attitude jets such as ion thrusters, or small, lightweight solar sails placed in locations away from the spacecraft's center of mass, such as on solar cell arrays or projecting masts. Most spacecraft, however, also need fast pointing, and cannot afford the extra mass of three attitude control systems. Designers therefore usually use conventional monopropellant vernier engines for all these purposes.|$|E

The induced current in the ring is be rectified and used to run electrical components on the ring itself, without the added weight of a battery.

In 1992 Woodward's was expanded and modernized into a shopping centre and took the name Woodwards Place.

50|$|Air {{is drawn}} into the {{cylinder}} through the intake valve as the piston descends (the induction stroke). During the same stroke, fuel is sprayed into the vaporizer by a mechanical (jerk-type) fuel pump through a nozzle. The air in the cylinder is then forced through {{the top of the}} cylinder as the piston rises (the compression stroke), through the opening into the vaporizer, where it is compressed and its temperature rises. The vaporized fuel mixes with the compressed air and ignites primarily due to the heat of the hot bulb generated while running, or heat applied to the hot bulb prior to starting. By contracting the bulb to a very narrow neck where it attaches to the cylinder, a high degree of turbulence is set up as the ignited gases flash through the neck into the cylinder, where combustion is completed. The resulting pressure drives the piston down (the power stroke). The piston's action is converted to a rotary motion by the crankshaft-flywheel assembly, to which equipment can be attached for work to be performed. The flywheel <b>stores</b> <b>momentum,</b> some of which is used to turn the engine when power is not being produced. The piston rises, expelling exhaust gases through the exhaust valve (the exhaust stroke). The cycle then starts again.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{developments}} {{in the area of}} nonlinear control theory have shown how coordiante changes in the state and input spaces can be used with nonlinear feedback to transform certain nonlinear ordinary differential equations into equivalent linear equations. These feedback linearization techniques are applied to resolve two problems arising in the control of spacecraft equipped with control moment gyroscopes (CMGs). The first application involves the computation of rate commands for the gimbals that rotate the individual gyroscopes to produce commanded torques on the spacecraft. The second application is to the long-term management of <b>stored</b> <b>momentum</b> in the system of control moment gyroscopes using environmental torques acting on the vehicle. An approach to distributing control effort among a group of redundant actuators is described that uses feedback linearization techniques to parameterize sets of controls which influence a specified subsystem in a desired way. The approach is adapted for use in spacecraft control with double-gimballed gyroscopes to produce an algorithm that avoids problematic gimbal configurations by approximating sets of gimbal rates that drive CMG rotors into desirable configurations. The momentum management problem is stated as a trajectory optimization problem with a nonlinear dynamical constraint. Feedback linearization and collocation are used to transform this problem into an unconstrainted nonlinear program. The approach to trajectory optimization is fast and robust. A number of examples are presented showing applications to the proposed NASA space station...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the feasibility of a satellite attitude fine-control system using the interaction of the earth's magnetic field with current-carrying coils to produce torque. The approximate intensity of the earth's magnetic field was determined {{as a function of the}} satellite coordinates. Components of the magnetic field were found to vary essentially sinusoidally at approximately twice orbital frequency. Amplitude and distortion of the sinusoidal components were a function of satellite orbit. Two systems for two-axis attitude control evolved from this study, one using three coils and the other using two coils. The torques developed by the two systems differ only when the component of magnetic field along the tracking line is zero. For this case the two-coil system develops no torque whereas the three-coil system develops some effective torque which allows partial control. The equations which describe the three-coil system are complex in comparison to those of the two-coil system and require the measurement of all three components of the magnetic field as compared with only one for the two-coil case. Intermittent three-axis torquing can also be achieved. This torquing can be used for coarse attitude control, or for dumping the <b>stored</b> <b>momentum</b> of inertia reaction wheels. Such a system has the advantage of requiring no fuel aboard the satellite. For any of these magnetic torquing schemes the power required to produce the magnetic moment and the weight of the coil seem reasonable...|$|E
40|$|We have {{performed}} momentum management analysis of various JWST schedules created using the JWST Mission Simulator and an enhanced Science and Operations Design Reference Mission. This study used the latest available torque tables and investigated three modes of Visit orientation assignment used {{to manage the}} momentum accumulation. In addition, the conditional scheduling of momentum unloads, and performing partial momentum unloads when possible was also investigated. Assuming one failed reaction wheel and the worst case torque tables, {{we find that the}} number of momentum unload activities per Station Keeping interval violates the existing Science & Operations Center requirement that limits the number of momentum unloads to two per interval. It was found that 65 % of the Station Keeping intervals had three or more Momentum Unloads. This required a change in the Orbit Determination method used to one less sensitive to multiple orbit perturbations. We also find that the roll optimization of scheduled visits and the conditional scheduling of partial Momentum Unloads provide a reduction of the <b>stored</b> <b>momentum</b> to be unloaded, a reduction of the number of Momentum Unloads, and a reduction of the time required to perform the Momentum Unloads as compared to un-optimized schedules. It is recommended that the Optimize Last Visit orientation assignment mode, partial Momentum Unloads, and the conditional scheduling of Momentum Unloads should be implemented. In addition, the Observatory design is being changed substantially {{at the time of this}} study and may change again in the future. It is recommended the study be repeated at each major Observatory design milestone...|$|E

40|$|That static {{electric}} and magnetic fields can <b>store</b> <b>momentum</b> may be perplexing, but {{is necessary to}} ensure total conservation of momentum. Simple situations in which such field momentum is transferred to nearby bodies and point charges have often been considered for pedagogical purposes, normally assuming vacuum surroundings. If dielectric media are involved, however, the analysis becomes more delicate, not least since one encounters the electromagnetic energy-momentum problem in matter, the `Abraham-Minkowski enigma', of what the momentum is of a photon in matter. We analyze the momentum balance in three nontrivial examples obeying azimuthal symmetry, showing how the momentum conservation is satisfied as the magnetic field decays and momentum is transferred to bodies present. In {{the last of the}} examples, that of point charge outside a dielectric sphere in an infinite magnetic field, we find that not all of the field momentum is transferred to the nearby bodies; a part of the momentum appears to vanish as momentum flux towards infinity. We discuss this and other surprising observations which {{can be attributed to the}} assumption of magnetic fields of infinite extent. We emphasize how formal arguments of conserved quantities cannot determine which energy-momentum tensor is more "correct", and each of our conservation checks may be performed equally well in the Minkowski or Abraham framework.

This has the effect of tending to stabilize that spacecraft axis to point in a nearly-fixed direction, allowing for a less-complicated attitude control system.
