Thus a vacuum insulated beam source (VIBS), where the whole beam source is immersed in vacuum, has been developed at JAERI. Recently, voltage holding capability of the VIBS was drastically improved by the large <b>stress</b> <b>ring,</b> which reduces the electric field concentration at the triple junction. Up to now, a high current density H- b am of 102 A/m 2 (140 mA) at 800 keV has been accelerated. The beam acceleration was quite stable and accomplished for several hundreds hots. The degradation of the voltage holding due to the beam acceleration and/or Cs seeding was not observed.

This study explores an alternative design method of the double-layer combined die using autofrettage theory. An analytical solution for the autofrettage process of the double-layer combined die is obtained based on Lamé's equation. The relationship between the autofrettage pressure and the yield radius of the die insert is obtained, and expressions of residual stresses and displacements, which {{are directly related to}} geometric parameters, material properties and internal pressure, are derived. The finite-element simulation of a specific case is performed, and good agreement between theoretical calculations and simulation results is found. Furthermore, the effects of important parameters, including the ratio of the plastic area and yield strength of the die insert and the outer diameters of the die insert and <b>stress</b> <b>ring,</b> on the autofrettage effect are investigated. Compared with the conventional combined die, the autofrettaged die can bear larger working pressure, as expected. The use of the autofrettaged die can reduce the amount of expensive material required for the die insert and the working space of the die set, which would benefit the practical forging process...|$|E

For example, X ray {{could be used to}} measure residual <b>stress</b> in <b>rings.</b> Through the measurement of residual stress, it could not only obtain the residual <b>stress</b> level after <b>ring</b> rolling, but also validate the finite element model to predict the residual stress distribution. However, because the ring surface was circle, it needs to cut a plane for X ray measure, and it increases measurement inaccuracy. This method only could be suited for qualitative analysis of residual <b>stress</b> in cold <b>ring</b> rolling, and it is not suitable for quantitative analysis of residual stress distribution...|$|R
40|$|Negative Bias {{temperature}} Instability (NBTI) {{has become}} one of the major sources of degradation in scaled PMOS devices, affecting the yield and reliability of circuits as well as the power and performance. As the oxide thickness decreases with each technology generation, increased oxide electric field and higher current densities degrade the performance and lifetimes of devices (especially PMOS) due to stress. Hence, it has become necessary to understand and accurately measure the effect of NBTI in PMOS devices. This paper proposes detection of PMOS threshold voltage degradation using on-chip slew-rate monitor circuitry.

50|$|There {{are exactly}} eight warped polygons with six {{distinguished}} corners that have all internal angles equal to θ and all sides equal to λ. They comprise two ideal chair conformations, where the carbons alternately lie {{above and below}} the mean ring plane; and six ideal boat conformations, where two opposite carbons lie above the mean plane, and the other four lie below it. In theory, a molecule with any of those ring conformations would be free of angle strain. However, due to interactions between the hydrogen atoms, the angles and bond lengths of the actual chair forms are slightly different from the nominal values. For the same reasons, the actual boat forms have slightly higher energy than the chair forms. Indeed, the boat forms are unstable, and deform spontaneously to twist-boat conformations that are local minima of the total energy, and therefore stable. Each of the stable ring conformations can be transformed into any other without breaking the ring. However, such transformations must go through other states with <b>stressed</b> <b>rings.</b> In particular, they must go through unstable states where four successive carbon atoms lie on the same plane. These shapes are called half-chair conformations.|$|R

Non-monotonic flow curves which can lead to flow instabilities during shear flow result at low equilibrium constant and high association rate from two complementary phenomena: a decrease in the fraction of elastically active chains with increasing shear rate and non-monotonic extension in the population of elastically active chains. Chain tumbling leads to reformation of bridges, resulting in an increased fraction of bridged chains at high Deborah number and significant reduction in the average bridge chain extension. In the start-up of steady shear, force-activated chain dissociation and chain tumbling cause both stress overshoot and <b>stress</b> <b>ringing</b> behaviour prior to reaching steady state stress values. During stress relaxation following steady shear, chain kinetics and extension mediate both the number of relaxations and the length of time required for system relaxation. While at low association rate relaxation is limited by the relaxation of dangling chains and the rate of dangling chain formation, at high association rate coupling of dangling and bridged chains leads to simultaneous relaxation of all chains due to a dynamic equilibrium between dangling and bridged states...|$|R

Maximum values of Mises and Tresca <b>stresses</b> and tunnel <b>ring</b> displacement (UMAX) were set as responses.

Caution is required to compare the actual apparent friction value with that obtained in ring shear tests. The most important {{difference is that the}} total normal <b>stress</b> in <b>ring</b> shear test is constant, while in the actual case, the normal stress generally decreases to lower level because the sliding mass always becomes thinner and thinner. Other reasons causing this difference may include (1) energy dissipation caused by the impact of the collision of the debris among the sliding mass, (2) some parts may not be in a fully saturated condition mobilizing a higher shear resistance. On the other hand, the test in laboratory was conducted in a simple and ideal situation with a fully saturated sample in undrained conditions. These factors may cause the difference between the actual apparent friction angle and test value.
