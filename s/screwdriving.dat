50|$|<b>Screwdriving</b> {{requires}} {{torque to}} be applied by a rotary motion. Drilling responds to the same description; general-purpose power tools ("drill/drivers") are designed for both <b>screwdriving</b> and drilling, with a slipping clutch and low speed added to the drilling functionality. In an industrial environment dedicated tools optimised for their particular function are more often used.|$|E
50|$|Bits and Bobs also is English {{slang for}} a {{collection}} of small items too numerous or varied to name individually. It originated from carpenters' tool kits containing parts for a drill, with bits used for making holes while bobs are routing or <b>screwdriving</b> drill attachments. Children laugh at the balls' mistakes at the end.|$|E
5000|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1919 by the two Brothers Franz and Herbert Schmidt in Zella-Mehlis. The Schmidt {{brothers}} started in their own living room, using a foot driven drilling machine, a mobile forge and some smaller tools. Four persons manufactured shotguns in 12, 16 and 20 gauge, {{as well as in}} [...]410 caliber; they also produced some <b>screwdriving</b> tools.|$|E
50|$|Wera Tools {{is one of}} {{the leading}} global <b>screwdriving</b> tool manufacturers. Its global {{headquarters}} and European sales team is based in Wuppertal, Germany. Wera has two wholly owned regional subsidiaries: in the UK (based in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, England) and North America (based in Ontario, Canada), where it is known as Wera Tools Inc. Outside of these areas, the company operates through a network of sales agents and wholesalers. Wera is a privately held company and employs more than 750 people.|$|E
5000|$|The {{field of}} {{ergonomics}} {{is based on}} scientific studies of ordinary people in work situations and {{is applied to the}} design of processes and machines, to the layout of work places, to methods of work, and to the control of the physical environment, in order to achieve greater efficiency of both men and machines [...] An example of an ergonomics study is the evaluation of the effects of screwdriver handle shape, surface material and workpiece orientation on torque performance, finger force distribution and muscle activity in a maximum <b>screwdriving</b> torque task. [...] Another example of an ergonomics study is the effects of shoe traction and obstacle height on friction. Similarly, many topics in ergonomics deal with the actual science of matching man to equipment and encompasses narrower fields such as Engineering Psychology.|$|E
40|$|AbstractCurrently, {{small scale}} {{manufacturing}} {{is limited to}} manual assembly due to high product specific costs for fully-automated production. Human robot collaboration (HRC) aims to overcome this problem with semi-automated production by incorporating sensor integrated robotics in more fields of human activity. One key aspect for industrial use of human-robot collaboration is cost efficient adaptability for different manufacturing scenarios. This paper introduces a method that satisfies these demands by simplifying robot tools. Algorithms leveraging the sensor integration of collaboration robots are used to reduce product specific costs. The feasibility of this method is validated by implementation into a flexible <b>screwdriving</b> tool...|$|E
40|$|Introduction : Midline lumbar fusion (MIDLF) using {{cortical}} bone trajectory is {{an alternative}} method of transpedicular spinal fusion for degenerative disease. The new entry points’ location and <b>screwdriving</b> direction allow the approach-related morbidity to be reduced. Aim: To present our preliminary experience with the MIDLF technique on the first 5 patients with lumbar degenerative disease and with follow-up of at least 6 months. Material and methods: Retrospective analysis {{was performed on the}} first 5 patients with foraminal (4) or central (1) stenosis operated on between December 2014 and February 2015. Three patients were fused at L 4 –L 5 and two at the L 5 –S 1 level. Results: No intra- or post-operative complications occurred with this approach. An improvement regarding the leading symptom in the early postoperative period (sciatica 4 / 4, claudication 1 / 1) was achieved in all patients. The mean improvements in the visual analogue scale for low back and leg pain were 2. 2 and 4. 8 respectively. The mean Oswestry Disability Index scores were 52 % (range: 16 – 82 %) before surgery and 33 % (range: 12 – 56 %) at 3 -month follow-up (mean improvement 19 %). At the most recent follow-up, 4 patients reported the maintenance of the satisfactory result. The early standing and follow-up X-rays showed satisfactory screw placement in all patients. Conclusions : In our initial experience, the MIDLF technique seems to be an encouraging alternative to traditional transpedicular trajectory screws when short level lumbar fusion is needed. Nevertheless, longer observations on larger groups of patients are needed to reliably evaluate the safety of the method and the sustainability of the results...|$|E
