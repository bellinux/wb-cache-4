40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate three breeding methods i. e. Bulk Method, Single Seed Descent and <b>Single</b> <b>Plant</b> <b>Progenies</b> in F 4 generation of blackgram to identify the most appropriate one for particular hybrid or character at two locations. In addition, inheritance of qualitative traits and hybrid performance for four generations was also studied. Inheritance study comprised four plant traits (pubescence, pod colour, seed coat colour and presence of spots on seed coat) in three crosses. Breeding methods in eleven crosses were investigated for plant height, number of branches planrl, pods planrl, length pod-s, seed pod-s, 100 seed weight planrl, biological yield planrl, grain yield planrl and harvest index over four generation at National Agricultural Research Center, (research station) and Fateh Jang (farmer's field). Eleven crosses were selected in F 2 from a six parent diallel and seeds were divided into three groups to evaluate Bulk Method, Single Seed Descent and Single Plant Progeny method. Two crosses (Mash 1 / 9020 and 9020 / 9012) gave better response to Bulk Method at both the locations, while 9020 /Mash 1 performed better for this method at NARC location only. All the crosses except 9025 /Mash 1 and 9025 / 9026 showed their worth in single seed descent. In <b>single</b> <b>plant</b> <b>progenies</b> at FJ, all the crosses showed better performance except 9020 / 9012. Plant height, pods planrl, pod length, seed pods-l, 100 seed weight, biological yield planrl and grain yield planrl showed better performance in <b>single</b> <b>plant</b> <b>progenies</b> at FJ while single seed descent showed its worth for number of branches, pods planrl, pod length, pod seed, biological yield planrl, grain yield planrl and harvest index at NARC location. <b>Single</b> <b>plant</b> <b>progenies</b> showed the best performance at FJ and it differed significantly for single seed descent at NARC. Bulk method revealed almost similar results at both the location with lowest index score. Four parents (Mash 1, Mash 3, MM 33 - 40, and 45726) were used to study inheritance of four qualitative characters, i. e., pubescence, seed coat colour, presence of spots on the seed coat and pod colour. All the four qualitative traits revealed monogenic nature of inheritance segregating in Mendelian ratio (3 : 1). The hairiness pattern was observed dominant over non-hairiness; brown seed coat colour dominant over green seed coat colour. Presence of spots on seed coat was dominant to absence of spots and black pod colour was dominant over brown pods in blackgram. Out of three hybrids, two (Mash IIMM 33 - 40 and 45726 IMM 33 - 40) revealed linkage between pod colour vs presence of spots on seed coat and pod colour vs seed coat colour that is suggested to be used for preliminary mapping in blackgram. The data were analyzed for hybrid vigour over the generations and it was observed that the source of variation attributed to hybrids as well as generations representing high proportions of the total sum of squares. A clear response for grouping of Fl and F 2 was observed, whereas other two generations (F 3 and F 4) were intermixed, although a low level of separation was observed. On the basis of performance and hybrid vigour, three hybrids (Mash 3 IMash 1, 9012 / 9025 and 9020 IMash 1) exhibited better potential. The hybrids with high mean performance and hybrids vigour are expected to give better chance for selection to develop superior cultivars of blackgram...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} the extent of natural outcrossing in pigeon pea in China, an experiment was conducted in Nanning, Guangxi province. Twenty single-row pigeon pea plants of ICPL 87091 were sown with breeding line having indeterminate growth habit and a matching flowering time. Five-metre-long plots were scattered in the field. At least 10 pollinator rows on either side of each ICPL 87091 plot were ensured. Insect activity was high in the entire field during the flowering stage. More than one type of insect was active, however, identification was not feasible. Among these, the predominance of honey bees was apparent. The data from <b>single</b> <b>plant</b> <b>progenies</b> of ICPL 87091 revealed a large plant-to-plant variation for natural outcrossing in the preceding season with a mean of 24. 6 %. In two progenies, no outcrossed hybrid plant was recorded, while in four progenies, more than 40 % hybrid plants were observed. One progeny recorded 60 % natural outcrossing. Of the 66 progenies evaluated, 52 exhibited 15 - 30 % natural outcrossing...|$|E
40|$|Single plant {{selection}} in F 2 progeny was effective when {{the performance of}} the selected F 2 single plant families were compared with the respective bulk progenies. The mean first infestation scores for aphids of all the families were significantly lower than the respective bulk progenies. Selected <b>single</b> <b>plant</b> <b>progenies</b> also recorded higher mean values for important traits related to aphid infestation. Seed yield per plant showed significantly positive genotypic correlation with height up to first branch, number of siliqua on branches, total number of siliqua per plant and 100 seed weight. First infestation score for aphids showed significantly negative correlations with length of main raceme, number of primary and secondary branches. Second infestation score showed significantly negative correlation with length of main raceme and number of primary branches but showed significantly positive correlation with first aphid infestation score. The result suggested that lines with higher aphid resistance and higher seed yield could be selected from the progenies, if selection is practiced for shorter plant height, more number of primary branches, higher number of seeds per siliqua and 100 seed weight along with lower infestation scores...|$|E

40|$|Summary – To {{increase}} the ef ciency of breeding peanuts resistant to Meloidogyne arenaria, we determined {{the utility of}} two RFLP loci linked to a single gene for resistance in identifying individuals putatively homozygous for resistance. DNA was extracted from leaf samples collected from each of 548 individuals from three segregating BC 7 F 2 : 4 breeding populations (TP 293 - 3 - 3, TP 296 - 4 and TP 301 - 1 - 8). The DNA was then digested with Eco RI, and Southern blotted to Hybond-N+ membranes. The membranes were probed with the RFLP probe R 2430 E, the autoradiographs scored for resistance genotype, then stripped and re-probedwith the probe R 2545 E. Samples from which no data were obtained due to problems in extraction, digestion, or hybridization ranged {{from a low of}} 14. 4 % for TP 301 - 1 - 8 probed with R 2430 E to a high of 38. 9 % for TP 296 - 4 - 4 probed with R 2545 E. Locus R 2430 identi ed 27. 6, 65. 1 and 29. 5 % of populations TP 293 - 3 - 3, TP 296 - 4 - 4 and TP 301 - 1 - 8, respectively, as being homozygous for resistance. The second locus, R 2545 E, identi ed 24. 5, 50 and 23. 5 %, respectively,of these populationsas homozygous for resistance. In glasshouse tests of nematode reproductionon progeny of individuals identi ed as homozygous for resistancebased on RFLP patterns, all 15 individualsof each of the 11 <b>single</b> <b>plant</b> <b>progeny</b> lines tested were resistant.

40|$|AbstractTobaccos VAM and NC 745 {{carry the}} {{recessive}} va gene that confers resistance to PVYNN. However, they exhibit {{different levels of}} resistance durability. Upon virus inoculation, only NC 745 developed sporadic systemic symptoms caused by emerging resistance-breaking variants that easily infected both NC 745 and VAM genotypes. To identify the differential host conditions associated with this phenomenon, cellular accumulation, cell-to-cell movement, vascular translocation, and foliar content of PVYNN were comparatively evaluated. Virus cell-to-cell movement was restricted and its transit through the vasculature boundaries was completely blocked in both tobacco varieties. However, an additional defense mechanism operating only in tobacco VAM drastically reduced the in situ cellular virus accumulation. Genetic analyses of hybrid <b>plant</b> <b>progenies</b> indicate that VAM-type resistance was conditioned by at least two recessive genes: va and a newly reported va 2 locus. Moreover, segregant <b>plant</b> <b>progenies</b> that restricted virus movement but permitted normal virus accumulation were prone to develop resistance-breaking infections...|$|R

40|$|Because gametophytic {{apomixis}} in alfalfa [lucerne] {{is strongly}} {{correlated with the}} occurrence of hybridity and poliploidy, bilateral sexual polyploidization (BSP) schemes were adopted for introgressing the diplosporic mutation of PG-F 9 at the tetraploid level using unreduced pollen producers of M. coerulea. Tetraploidized F 1 plants from BSP were then backcrossed with mutant PG-F 9 (employed as unreduced egg donor) and the BC 1 progenies screened for level of ploidy, occurrence of diplospory, genetic similarity with diploid parents, and fertility in controlled matings with tetraploid testers of M. sativa. Nine tetraploid BC 1 plants out of 15 recovered showed a degree of diplospory ranging from 5. 04 to 40. 96 %. In order to promote parthenogenesis in these mutants, named DTA (Diplosporic Tetraploidized Alfalfa), two methods were adopted: treatments with auxins and crosses after emasculation with M. coerulea. Four plants yielded an average of 5. 7 seeds out of 47 flowers treated with NAA, whereas two plants produced an average of 5. 6 seeds out of 46 flowers pollinated. These seeds were sown and DNA samples from each plant were analyzed with PCR-based molecular markers. To assess the genetic identity between progenies and the mother plants, two markers per linkage group of an already developed genetic map will be scored. The presence of all selected maternal markers in a <b>single</b> <b>progeny</b> <b>plant</b> will support that seeds were formed by apomixis.

40|$|Abstract: The {{research}} was aimed to determine relationships between seed yield and some yield components of 20 sweet fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill. var dulce) lines. The highest positive correlation (r= 0. 915) was recorded between biological yield and <b>single</b> <b>plant</b> yield.

One thousand seed weight was negatively correlated with essential oil percentage. The highest positive and direct effect on seed yield was shown by number of umbellets, while maximum negative and direct contribution to it was made by biological yield. In addition, <b>single</b> <b>plant</b> yield, plant height and one thousand seed weight affected seed yield positively. <b>Single</b> <b>plant</b> yield had maximum direct effect (32. 95 %) on essential oil percentage followed by plant height (24. 60 %) and number of branches (15. 11 %).
