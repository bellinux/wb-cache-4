5|$|Some {{stretches}} of Fishing Creek contain {{significant amounts of}} algae because of leaking <b>septic</b> <b>systems</b> in the watershed. The area around the tributary West Creek is the least habitable part of the Fishing Creek area, according to a 2011 study. The water quality of Fishing Creek can vary. Its pH ranges from 4.9 to 8.5, while the concentration of dissolved oxygen ranges from 5 to 17.5mg per liter. The creek's average discharge is 615 cubic feet per second (17.4 m3/s); its watershed contains gravel, shale and various loams—in particular the Albrights soil series and the Leck Kill soil.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{permitted}} the POWs to build <b>septic</b> <b>systems</b> and irrigation ditches throughout the prisoner {{side of the}} camp. An onsite commissary was available to sell items such as bananas, eggs, coffee, notebooks, and cigarettes. Recreational activities allowed for baseball, horseshoes, and ping pong matches. In addition, a 3,000-book library was allowed (much of which {{was provided by the}} Red Cross), and films were shown occasionally. A bulldog was kept by the prisoners, and served as a mascot for the camp. Each year around Christmas, the Japanese guards gave permission for the Red Cross to donate a small box to each of the prisoners, containing items such as corned beef, instant coffee, and tobacco. Prisoners were also able to send postcards to relatives, although they were censored by the guards.|$|E

40|$|The 331 Life Sciences Laboratory Drain Field (LSLDF) <b>septic</b> <b>system</b> waste site {{consists}} of a diversion chamber, two septic tanks, a distribution box, and a drain field. This <b>septic</b> <b>system</b> was designed to receive sanitary waste water, from animal studies conducted in the 331 -A and 331 -B Buildings, for discharge into the soil column. However, field observations and testing suggest the 331 LSLDF <b>septic</b> <b>system</b> did not receive any discharges. In accordance with this evaluation, the confirmatory sampling results support a reclassification of the 331 LSLDF waste site to No Action.

5|$|Even though Croatia has {{sufficient}} water resources at its disposal, {{these are not}} uniformly distributed and public water supply network losses remain high—estimated at 44%. Between 2004 and 2008, the number of stations monitoring surface water pollution increased by 20%; the CEA reported 476 cases of water pollution in this period. At the same time organic waste pollution levels decreased slightly, which is attributed to the completion of new sewage treatment plants; their number increased 20%, reaching a total of 101. Nearly all of Croatia's groundwater aquifers are top quality, unlike the available surface water; the latter's quality varies in terms of biochemical oxygen demand and bacteriological water analysis results. As of 2008, 80% of the Croatian population are served by the public water supply system, but only 44% of the population {{have access to the}} public sewerage network, with <b>septic</b> <b>systems</b> in use. Adriatic Sea water quality monitoring between 2004 and 2008 indicated very good, oligotrophic conditions along most of the coast, while areas of increased eutrophication were identified in the Bay of Bakar, the Bay of Kaštela, the Port of Šibenik and near Ploče; other areas of localized pollution were identified near the larger coastal cities. In the period between 2004 and 2008, the CEA identified 283 cases of marine pollution (including 128 from vessels), which was a drop of 15% relative to the period encompassed by the previous report, 1997 to August 2005.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, the {{comparison}} between UDDTs and septic tank-based sanitation systems is not as straightforward as {{the comparison}} with pit latrines as a septic system also treats greywater. However, the relatively high costs of <b>septic</b> <b>systems,</b> particularly mound-type <b>septic</b> <b>systems</b> can be partially mitigated or, if {{used in conjunction with}} an onsite greywater system, eliminated altogether by installing UDDTs in place of flush toilets.|$|E

40|$|Baseflow water {{chemistry}} between different <b>septic</b> <b>system</b> density groups was analyzed {{to understand how}} <b>septic</b> <b>system</b> usage impacts the water quality of the Yellow River Watershed located in Gwinnett County, Georgia. Seventy water samples were collected at baseflow conditions {{in the summer of}} 2006. The samples were analyzed for the abundance and distribution of chlorides, sulfates, nitrates, and specific conductance. Geographic Information Systems were used to determine sample collection sites, assign samples into density groups, and spatially analyze and display the results. Statistical methods were used to compare the results of each density group with all others,and to find any correlation of the anions with respect to specific conductance. Regression coefficient values between nitrate and specific conductance in all groups average 0. 77 and the elevated nitrate concentrations in group four suggest a limited relationship between <b>septic</b> <b>system</b> density and baseflow water quality...|$|R

40|$|Concerns {{from local}} health {{departments}} regarding premature <b>septic</b> <b>system</b> failure (less than 1 year from installation) {{has led to an}} investigation of <b>septic</b> <b>system</b> soil absorption field design parameters in northeast Indiana. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the loading rate based on field measured saturated hydraulic conductivity (LRm) across a toposequence to the estimated allowable loading rate (LRe) based on soil morphological properties. Saturated hydraulic conductivity measurements were determined by a compact constant-head permeameter at five landscape positions, at four depths (surface horizon, upper argillic horizon, transition zone between the argillic horizon and till parent material, and till). Results showed that for all depths, the LRm was smaller than LRe. Results from this study suggest that the current method of using soil morphological properties to determine the loading rate may overestimate the ability of the soil to properly disperse <b>septic</b> <b>system</b> effluent...|$|R

25|$|In many {{suburban}} {{and rural areas}} households are not connected to sewers, and they rather use on-site sewage facilities or decentralised treatment if they are connected to piped water and use flush toilets. They discharge their wastewater into septic tanks or other types of on-site sanitation systems (e.g. Sequencing batch reactors or constructed wetlands). On-site systems include drain fields, which require significant area of land. This makes <b>septic</b> <b>systems</b> unsuitable for most cities.|$|E

25|$|Polluted {{groundwater}} is less visible, {{but more}} difficult to clean up, than pollution in rivers and lakes. Groundwater pollution most often results from improper disposal of wastes on land. Major sources include industrial and household chemicals and garbage landfills, excessive fertilizers and pesticides used in agriculture, industrial waste lagoons, tailings and process wastewater from mines, industrial fracking, oil field brine pits, leaking underground oil storage tanks and pipelines, sewage sludge and <b>septic</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|E
25|$|Individual wells are {{the primary}} source of water in Slana; others draw water from Rufus Creek. The schools operate {{individual}} wells.

25|$|A {{class action}} suit was filed in 2014 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, {{on behalf of}} {{consumers}} in Ohio that purchased Target-brand wet wipes. The lawsuit filed against Target Corporation alleges the retailer misled consumers by marking the packaging on its up & up® brand wipes as flushable and safe for sewer and <b>septic</b> <b>systems.</b> The lawsuit also alleges that so-called flushable wipes are a public health hazard because they are alleged to clog pumps at municipal waste-treatment facilities.|$|E
50|$|The {{aeration}} {{stage and}} the disinfecting stage are the primary differences from a traditional septic system; in fact, an aerobic treatment system {{can be used as}} a secondary treatment for septic tank effluent. These stages increase the initial cost of the aerobic system, and also the maintenance requirements over the passive <b>septic</b> <b>system.</b> Unlike many other biofilters, aerobic treatment systems require a constant supply of electricity to drive the air pump increasing overall system costs. The disinfectant tablets must be periodically replaced, as well as the electrical components (air compressor) and mechanical components (air diffusers). On the positive side, an aerobic system produces a higher quality effluent than a septic tank, and thus the leach field can be smaller than that of a conventional <b>septic</b> <b>system,</b> and the output can be discharged in areas too environmentally sensitive for <b>septic</b> <b>system</b> output. Some aerobic systems recycle the effluent through a sprinkler system, using it to water the lawn where regulations approve.|$|R

25|$|Human-generated {{pollution}} {{of the lake}} and, by extension, New York City's watershed, also increased. Local communities resisted pressure from the city to install sewage treatment plants until the late 1990s, when more of those communities were relying on city water to handle their rapid development. In 2000 {{the city and the}} county reached a deal to build a plant to handle sewage from the many homes around the lake whose original <b>septic</b> <b>systems</b> were failing, and divert it to the Hudson River. Four years later the city also helped the town and county install stormwater control units along Route 52.|$|E
25|$|At more {{realistic}} levels, developing countries can strive to achieve primary wastewater treatment or secure <b>septic</b> <b>systems,</b> and carefully analyse wastewater outfall design to minimise impacts to {{drinking water and}} to ecosystems. Developed countries can not only share technology better, including cost-effective wastewater and water treatment systems but also in hydrological transport modeling. At the individual level, people in developed countries can look inward and reduce overconsumption, which further strains worldwide water consumption. Both developed and developing countries can increase protection of ecosystems, especially wetlands and riparian zones. These measures will not only conserve biota, but also render more effective the natural water cycle flushing and transport that make water systems more healthy for humans.|$|E
25|$|Another recent {{environmental}} issue in Melbourne was the Victorian government project of channel deepening Melbourne Ports by dredging Port Phillip Bay—the Port Phillip Channel Deepening Project. It {{was subject to}} controversy and strict regulations among fears that beaches and marine wildlife could {{be affected by the}} disturbance of heavy metals and other industrial sediments. Other major pollution problems in Melbourne include levels of bacteria including E. coli in the Yarra River and its tributaries caused by <b>septic</b> <b>systems,</b> as well as litter. Up to 350,000 cigarette butts enter the storm water runoff every day. Several programs are being implemented to minimise beach and river pollution. In February 2010, The Transition Decade, an initiative to transition human society, economics and environment towards sustainability, was launched in Melbourne.|$|E
