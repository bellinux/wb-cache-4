50|$|The {{township}} was fused {{from several}} medieval villages (Bugy, Vány, Ráda, Ürbo). The region’s natural {{and economic development}} was defined by the Danube’s ancient river bank, which was drained in the 1920s. As {{a result of its}} various soil types and micro climate, the region is especially well suited for agricultural production; hence, its important role in providing the capital with fresh produce. The town neighbors an area of gravel mines, so its geography is <b>spackled</b> with mining lakes.|$|E

40|$|Silica based {{multifunctional}} heterostructures, exhibiting {{near infrared}} (NIR) absorption (650 – 1200 nm) and luminescence in the visible region, represent innovative nanosystems useful for diagnostic or theranostic applications. Herein, colloidal synthetic procedures {{are applied to}} design a photoactive multifunctional nanosystem. Luminescent silica (SiO 2) coated quantum dots (QDs) {{have been used as}} versatile nanoplatforms to assemble on their surface gold (Au) seeds, further grown into Au <b>spackled</b> structures. The synthesized nanostructures combine the QD emission in the visible region, and, concomitantly, the distinctive NIR absorption of Au nanodomains. The possibility of having multiple QDs in a single heterostructure, the SiO 2 shell thickness, and the extent of Au deposition onto SiO 2 surface have been carefully controlled. The work shows that a single QD entrapped in 16 nm thick SiO 2 shell, coated with Au speckles, represents the most suitable geometry to preserve the QD emission in the visible region and to generate NIR absorption from metal NPs. The resulting architectures present a biomedical potential as an effective optical multimodal probes and as promising therapeutic agents due to the Au NP mediated photothermal effect...|$|E

40|$|Conventional {{wallboard}} impregnated with octadecane paraffin [melting point- 23 C (73. 5 F) ] {{is being}} developed as a building material with latent heat storage for passive solar and other applications. Impregnation was accomplished simply by soaking the wallboard in molten wax. Concentrations of wax in the combined product as high as 35 % by weight can be achieved. Scale-up of the soaking process, from small laboratory samples to full-sized 4 - by 8 -ft sheets, has been successfully accomplished. The required construction properties of wallboard are maintained after impregnation, that is, it can be painted and <b>spackled.</b> Long-term, high-temperature exposure tests and thermal cycling tests showed no tendency of the paraffin to migrate within the wallboard, {{and there was no}} deterioration of thermal energy storage capacity. In support of this concept, a computer model was developed to handle thermal transport and storage by a phase change material (PCM) dispersed in a porous media. The computer model was confirmed by comparison with known analytical solutions and also by comparison with temperatures measured in wallboard during an experimentally generated thermal transient. Agreement between the model and known solution was excellent. Agreement between the model and thermal transient was good, only after the model was modified to allow the PCM to melt over a temperature range, rather than at a specific melting point. When the melting characteristics of the PCM (melting point, melting range, and heat of fusion), as determined from a differential scanning calorimeter plot, were used in the model, agreement between the model and transient data was very good. The confirmed computer model may now be used in conjunction with a building heating and cooling code to evaluate design parameters and operational characteristics of latent heat storage wallboard for passive solar applications...|$|E
40|$|Crack {{formation}} in the space shuttle's heat shield during flight poses a major safety concern to everyone on board. Cracking weakens {{the structure of the}} shield and lessens the protection it offers against the high temperatures and forces encountered during re-entry. Astronauts need a way to mend these cracks while in space. This is GRABER s function; it can be <b>spackled</b> into the cracks by an astronaut. The material then hardens, or cures, due to being in a vacuum and the heat encountered when it faces the sun. A great deal of work and testing is necessary to create a material that will be workable in a vacuum over a wide range of temperatures, will cure without cracking, will adhere to the sides of the crack, and that can withstand the extreme temperatures of re-entry. A Brookfield PVS Rheometer is being used to characterize GRABER's viscosity at various temperatures and stirring rates. Various compositions of GRABER are being heat treated in a vacuum to determine probably curing times in space. The microstructures of cured samples of each composition are being examined using both optical and electron microscopy. Jupiter s Icy Moon Orbiter (JIMO) will be lifting off sometime around 2013. JIMO will have more power than its predecessor, Galileo, allowing it to change orbits to circle three of Jupiter s moons. Both of the engine types being considered require large heat dissipation systems. These systems will be comprised of heat conductive tubing and plates with a liquid flowing through them. In order to maximize the speed of heat transfer between the tubes and the panels, the in-between areas will be filled with heat conductive silicon carbide foam. Two different foam systems are being considered for this foam. Currently, experimentation is underway with adding Sic, carbon, and carbon fibers to a two part fuel retardant foam. The foam is them pyrolized and its mass and dimensional changes are measured. The structure of the foam will be examined using optical and electron microscopy as well. Work is also planned with a foam system developed by an Italian team...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{bacteriophage}} T 4 e gene encodes lysozyme (e-lysozyme), which releases progeny phage after normal {{infection of}} Escherichia coli cells. A mutation in the <b>spackle</b> gene suppresses the defect in e-lysozyme (Emrich, 1968). The <b>spackle</b> gene was mapped between genes 41 and 61, but its precise location has not previously been determined. In the current study, we constructed an amber mutant of gene 61. 3, amST 14, by site-directed mutagenesis. The gene 61. 3 mutant shares phenotypes with <b>spackle</b> mutants: The amST 14 mutant forms large plaques with sharp edges and exhibits truncated lysis inhibition, and furthermore, the mutation can suppress the defect in e-lysozyme activity. In addition, cloned gene 61. 3 can rescue (by homologous recombination) {{as well as}} complement the S 12 mutation in the <b>spackle</b> gene. These results strongly suggest that gene 61. 3 is the <b>spackle</b> gene. Indeed, the S 12 mutant has one base deletion of five in a consecutive A tract in the gene 61. 3 coding region, substituting an unrelated 6 -amino acid sequence for the 9 C-terminal amino acids in the gene 61. 3 protein. The gene 61. 3 protein is predicted to localize in the periplasmic space after cleavage of a signal sequence...|$|R
40|$|Motivated by {{issues at}} a {{manufacturer}} of customized- and standard messenger bags, we develop an iterative two-stage framework (involving marketing and operations models) to determine {{the conditions under which}} a firm benefits from production <b>spackling.</b> With <b>spackling,</b> the firm uses flexible capacity to produce custom products as demanded each period, and then fills in, or <b>spackles,</b> the production schedule with make-to-stock output of standard products to restock inventory. <b>Spackling</b> broadly addresses market preferences, while mitigating the effects of "bumpy" demand for custom products by smoothing production, thereby improving capacity utilization as compared to a focused approach, where standard items are made with efficient capacity and custom products with flexible capacity. The marketing model employs logit-based choice and, given product costs and customer preferences, identifies optimal pricing, expected demand, and demand variability. Interestingly, we find that, under certain assumptions, the firm should price all products to achieve a constant absolute dollar markup. The resultant demand parameters are fed into an operations model, which specifies optimal efficient and flexible capacities (and decides between <b>spackling</b> and focus), thereby determining product costs, which are fed back into the marketing model to solve iteratively. That is, we link operations decisions regarding capacity to marketing decisions regarding price, and vice-versa. We examine conditions under which convergence of the two models is achieved, and illustrate our framework with data from the messenger bag manufacturer...|$|R
