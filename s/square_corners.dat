5|$|The {{second early}} stone design, {{emerging}} from the 12th century onwards, was the shell keep, a donjon annulaire in French, which involved replacing the wooden keep on a motte, or the palisade on a ringwork, with a circular stone wall. Shell keeps were sometimes further protected by an additional low protective wall, called a chemise, around their base. Buildings could then be built around {{the inside of the}} shell, producing a small inner courtyard at the centre. The style was particularly popular in south-east England and across Normandy, although less so elsewhere. Restormel Castle {{is a classic example of}} this development, as is the later Launceston Castle; prominent Normandy and Low Country equivalents include Gisors and the Burcht van Leiden – these castles were amongst the most powerful fortifications of the period. Although the circular design held military advantages over one with <b>square</b> <b>corners,</b> as noted above these really mattered from only the end of the 12th century onwards; the major reason for adopting a shell keep design, in the 12th century at least, was the circular design of the original earthworks exploited to support the keep; indeed, some designs were less than circular in order to accommodate irregular mottes, such as that found at Windsor Castle.|$|E
25|$|Räikkönen passed Kobayashi at the Novelle chicane for 12th {{place on}} lap 33 but ran wide {{and handed the}} {{position}} back to Kobayashi. Vergne was handed a drive-through penalty for his unsafe pit stop release on the following lap and served it four laps later. After Räikkönen got past Kobayashi, Bianchi made contact with the Japanese driver three times en route to overtaking him around the outside at Rasacasse corner for 13th on lap 36. Upfront, Rosberg continued to lead Hamilton and the two drivers {{pulled away from the}} rest of the field. Grosjean started to pressure Kobayashi for 14th but had difficulty passing the driver. He was able to get ahead of Kobayashi by braking late for the Novelle chicane on lap 40. Rosberg was instructed by his team over the radio that he should use longer gears at Sainte Dévote and Casino <b>Square</b> <b>corners</b> to save fuel. This meant Rosberg defended from Hamilton over the next few laps because of him having to lift and coast. Hamilton closed up to Rosberg but was unable to affect an overtaking manoeuvre on his teammate who had faster acceleration entering the tunnel. Massa made his only pit stop of the race on lap 45 and emerged in 11th place behind Räikkönen but ahead of Bianchi.|$|E

500|$|During {{the first}} phase of {{construction}} (1848–54), the walls were built with bluestone gneiss rubble, ranging from very large irregular stones having a cross section of about [...] down to spalls (broken pieces of stone) all embedded in a large amount of mortar. The outer surface is marble stones [...] thick in [...] high courses or rows horizontally encircling the monument. Although each course contains both stretchers (stones parallel to the wall) and headers (stones projecting into the wall), about two to three times as many stretchers as headers were used. Their joints were so thin that some stones pressed on bare stone below them, breaking off many pieces since it was constructed. The batter or slope of the outer surface is 0.247 inches per foot (2.06cm/m, 1°11'). The inner surface has disorderly rows of smaller roughly dressed bluestone gneiss.

40|$|Here {{we study}} retroreflectors based on {{specular}} reflections. Two kinds of asymptotically perfect specular retroreflectors in two dimensions, Notched angle and Tube, are known at present. We conduct {{comparative study of}} their efficiency, assuming that the reflection coefficient is slightly less than 1. We also compare their efficiency with {{the one of the}} retroreflector <b>Square</b> <b>corner</b> (the 2 D analogue of the well-known and widely used Cube corner). The study is partly analytic and partly uses numerical simulations. We conclude that the retro-reflectivity of Notched angle is normally much greater than those of Tube and the <b>Square</b> <b>corner.</b> Additionally, simple Notched angle shapes are constructed, whose efficiency is significantly higher than that of the <b>Square</b> <b>corner...</b>|$|R
2500|$|What {{was once}} a {{concrete}} square, outside of the library and student center, was transformed with brick pavers and granite curb stones, in a scalloped design that would eliminate all <b>square</b> <b>corners,</b> a concept developed by the outgoing class of 1989 in a [...] "Northeastern News" [...] poll and suggestion to the President Box that {{was presented to the}} board of Trustees in March 1988.

2500|$|The {{most common}} digit to become ingrown {{is the big}} toe, but {{ingrowth}} can occur on any nail. Ingrown nails can be avoided by cutting nails straight across; not along a curve, not too short and no shorter than the flesh around it. Footwear that is too small or too narrow, or with too shallow of a [...] "toe box", will exacerbate any underlying problem with a toenail. Sharp <b>square</b> <b>corners</b> may be uncomfortable and cause snagging on socks. Proper cutting leaves {{the leading edge of}} the nail free of the flesh, precluding it from growing into the toe. Filing of the corner is reasonable. Some nails require cutting of the corners far back to remove edges that dig into the flesh; this is often done as a partial wedge resection by a podiatrist. Ingrown toe nails can be caused by injury, commonly blunt trauma in which the flesh is pressed against the nail causing a small cut that swells. Injury to the nail can cause it to grow abnormally, making it wider or thicker than normal, or even bulged or crooked.|$|E
60|$|Colonel Zane's house, a two story {{structure}} {{built of}} rough hewn logs, {{was the most}} comfortable one in the settlement, and occupied a prominent site on the hillside about one {{hundred yards from the}} fort. It was constructed of heavy timber and presented rather a forbidding appearance with its <b>square</b> <b>corners,</b> its ominous looking portholes, and strongly barred doors and windows. There were three rooms on the ground floor, a kitchen, a magazine room for military supplies, and a large room for general use. The several sleeping rooms were on the second floor, which was reached by a steep stairway.|$|E

60|$|So our two {{travellers}} {{began to}} descend; and, after turning several <b>square</b> <b>corners</b> in the staircase, {{they came out}} into the street which led along the margin of the river, at a level of twenty or thirty feet below the bridge. This street passed through under one of the dry arches of the bridge, as they are called; that is, one built on the sloping margin of the shore, where no water flows. They passed across this street, and then entered a broad passage way which led down towards the floating platforms. There were a great many people coming and going. They stopped at the toll house on one of the little bridges to pay the fare.|$|E
60|$|Had {{there been}} any keel to the Ark, it would inevitably have run foul of the platform, bows on, when it is {{probable}} nothing could have prevented the Hurons from carrying it; more particularly as the sail would have enabled them to approach under cover. As it was, the scow wore slowly round, barely clearing {{that part of the}} building. The piles projecting several feet, they were not cleared, but the head of the slow moving craft caught between two of them, by one of its <b>square</b> <b>corners,</b> and hung. At this moment the Delaware was vigilantly watching through a loop for an opportunity to fire, while the Hurons kept within the building, similarly occupied. The exhausted warrior reclined against the hut, there having been no time to remove him, and Hurry lay, almost as helpless as a log, tethered like a sheep {{on its way to the}} slaughter, near the middle of the platform. Chingachgook could have slain the first, at any moment, but his scalp would have been safe, and the young chief disdained to strike a blow that could lead to neither honor nor advantage.|$|E

50|$|When {{viewed from}} the top, metal {{counterweight}} is basically rectangular, typically with 45-degree angle chamfers cut at two opposing corners. A slot is cut into {{each end of the}} weight so as to enable the weight to straddle, and be laterally secured by, the arbor rods. In order to facilitate removal of weights with angle cuts, it is customary to stack the weights in alternating orientations so that the <b>square</b> <b>corners</b> of any weight will be aligned with the angled corners of adjacent weights.
