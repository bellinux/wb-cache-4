25|$|The Wexford Cot is a flat {{bottomed}} boat {{used for}} fishing on the tidal mudflats in Wexford, also a canoe shaped Punt {{fitted with a}} gun, called a Float in Wexford is used traditionally to shoot game birds in the North <b>Slob</b> mud flats.|$|E
25|$|Occasionally, {{television}} pilots {{that have}} not to date been developed as full series are shown, such as Nemesis and Bob the <b>Slob</b> (both in 2015). Teletoon also airs select programs from Nickelodeon such as ALVINNN! and the Chipmunks, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Power Rangers, as well as programs from Cartoon Network.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s Howie and Sheila Casey formed The <b>Slobs,</b> a rhythm and blues, soul and {{rock and roll}} band {{comprising}} locally based session musicians. With a varying line-up, The <b>Slobs</b> continue to perform in southern England and to tour more widely. Sheila Casey died from cancer in December 2012.|$|R

5000|$|In 2008 Mackey {{released}} his first EP, Feng Shui for <b>Slobs,</b> with 3 tracks [...] "Painted Red", [...] "Radio," [...] and [...] "Bandage." [...] This release garnered {{the placement of}} [...] "Painted Red" [...] on the Disney TV show, Naturally Sadie.|$|R
25|$|South-eastern Wexford is an {{important}} site for wild birds—the north side of Wexford Harbour, the North <b>Slob,</b> is home to 10,000 Greenland white-fronted geese each winter (roughly {{one third of the}} entire world's population), while in the summer Lady's Island Lake is {{an important}} breeding site for terns, especially the roseate tern. The grey heron is also seen.|$|E
25|$|This {{much larger}} city, however, remains characterised by the often {{extremely}} steep hills that form {{much of its}} terrain {{on both sides of}} the river. A notable exception to this lies on the north-eastern edge of the city, on the shores of Lough Foyle, where large expanses of sea and mudflats were reclaimed in the middle of the 19th century. Today, these <b>slob</b> lands are protected from the sea by miles of sea walls and dikes. The area is an internationally important bird sanctuary, ranked among the top 30 wetland sites in the UK.|$|E
25|$|It was at USL that Toole met Bob Byrne, an {{eccentric}} English professor {{who is considered}} one of the primary inspirations for the character of Ignatius J. Reilly. Byrne specialized in the medieval period, and he and Toole frequently discussed the philosopher Boethius and the wheel of Fortuna, as described in Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy. Boethius was the favorite philosopher of Ignatius J. Reilly, who frequently referred to Fortuna and Consolation of Philosophy. Like Ignatius, Byrne was a self-admitted devoted <b>slob</b> who played the lute, and also wore a deerstalker hunting cap, which Toole frequently chided him about.|$|E
50|$|On {{the mining}} vessel Red Dwarf, Dave Lister (Craig Charles) and Arnold Rimmer (Chris Barrie) {{go about their}} daily routine of {{maintenance}}. Rimmer takes the maintenance duties very seriously while Lister would rather be <b>slobbing</b> around and drinking with his ship mates Petersen, Selby and Chen. But {{it is not always}} about <b>slobbing</b> and drinking, he has a plan which he tells his pregnant cat Frankenstein. When he gets back to Earth he is going to start a farm on Fiji and bring the only true love of his life, Kristine Kochanski (Clare Grogan). Rimmer on the other hand is more concerned with his career and prepares for his latest engineering exam by copying notes and equations onto his arms and legs.|$|R
5000|$|Choreographer Michael Kidd {{originally}} {{turned down}} the film, recalling in 1997: [...] "Here are these <b>slobs</b> living off in the woods. They have no schooling, they are uncouth, there's manure on the floor, the cows come in and out - and they're gonna get up and dance? We'd be laughed out of the house." ...|$|R
50|$|The Wexford Wildfowl Reserve is a Ramsar site {{based on}} mudflats, (known locally as slobland), just outside Wexford. It is a migratory {{stop-off}} point {{for thousands of}} ducks, geese, swans and waders. Up to 12,000 (50% of the world's population) of Greenland white-fronted geese spend the winter on the Wexford <b>slobs.</b> There is a visitor centre with exhibitions and an audio-visual show.|$|R
25|$|In fact, two routes out of Belfast were surveyed. One was an inland route {{beginning}} at the Antrim Road and skirting Cave Hill. The other started at the junction of York Road and Corporation Street; it ran north on an embankment across <b>slob</b> land on the western shore of Belfast Lough. To ease the gradient, {{it was necessary for}} the line to Ballymena to leave the Carrickfergus branch by means of a trailing junction 6½ miles from Belfast. Lanyon strongly favoured this latter coastal route and reported accordingly at a public meeting in Antrim courthouse on 20 May 1844. A motion was carried that a complete survey of the line was to be completed and that costs were to be defrayed by opening a subscription.|$|E
500|$|The cast of {{both the}} British and American {{versions}} criticised the casting of Red Dwarf USA, particularly the part of Lister who is portrayed in the British version as a likable <b>slob</b> but in the US version as somewhat clean cut. In the 2004 documentary Dwarfing USA, Danny John-Jules said the only actor who could have successfully portrayed an American Lister was John Belushi. In a 2009 interview on Kevin Pollak's Chat Show, Bierko said that casting him as Lister was a [...] "huge mistake" [...] and also said a [...] "John Belushi type" [...] {{would have been better}} suited to the role.|$|E
500|$|Bornheimer {{was cast}} in the {{recurring}} role by October 2014, {{as part of the}} series [...] "stocking up on male counterparts" [...] for Carter to deal with throughout the series. In terms of costume designe, Ottobre-Melton described Krzeminski as [...] "a bit of a <b>slob</b> with his sport jacket, and open collar shirts." [...] After the character's death, Butters explained that Carter would feel guilty about it moving forward, as it was her decisions that [...] "inadvertently put Krzeminski at risk". His death also affected the series in general, with Fazekas explaining, [...] "The stakes have changed now, they’ve gotten a lot more serious. The episodes that come subsequently really reflect that".|$|E
50|$|Mrs. Tubbs: The Hunters' grumpy next-door neighbor. Every single book so far {{includes}} {{at least}} one disaster in which Mrs. Tubbs finds herself as an unsuspecting victim. This is often {{due in part to}} her overfed and over-pampered cat, Precious, who has an ongoing feud with the Hunters' dog, <b>Slobs.</b> It has been revealed that Mrs. Tubbs wears a wig.|$|R

50|$|The {{episode was}} pitched by John Frink and Don Payne. The episode was {{inspired}} by Don Payne's mother's neighbourhood, where one side would spread rumors about the other side. Larry Doyle then pitched that the sides split apart because of different area codes. During production the staff did not want one side to be <b>slobs</b> like Homer Simpson and the other snobs like Mr. Burns, but this ended up happening in the final product. The writers later opened a website about what badgers eat.|$|R
500|$|In July 1999, the Democratic polling firm Schroth and Associates {{conducted}} {{a poll of}} 400 Reform Party leaders and found Trump tied for third place for the Reform Party presidential nomination. [...] Both the Reform Party and Trump denied having commissioned the poll. Days later, Newsweek raised speculation when it cited an unnamed [...] "close friend" [...] of Trump who said Trump was [...] "toying" [...] {{with the idea of}} a presidential campaign, allegedly in response to rumors of Ventura's courting of Weicker for a run. [...] Trump purportedly held a grudge against Weicker for blocking his plans to build a casino in Bridgeport in 1994. [...] The two had an exchange of insults in which Weicker labeled Trump a [...] "dirt bag" [...] and Trump referred to Weicker as [...] "a fat <b>slob</b> who couldn't get elected dog catcher." [...] In response to the Newsweek report, Trump sent out a press release in which he criticized the two party system, praised the Reform Party, and stated [...] "If the Reform Party nominated me, I would probably run and probably win." [...] However, he added that if the party nominated him, he would ask for [...] "an immediate recount." [...] In an interview, he told The New York Times, [...] "I'm honored and I'm flattered , but the fact is I've never had more fun than I'm having right now, building the most spectacular buildings in New York." [...] Chairman Verney denied that the Reform Party had any interest in Trump, explaining that party members had [...] "never spent one second thinking about him." [...] A CNN-Time poll conducted later in July showed Trump with seven percent support nationally in a match up against Republican candidate George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore.|$|E

2500|$|Little Orphan Annie lent itself {{easily to}} parody, which {{was taken up}} by both Walt Kelly in Pogo (as [...] "Little Arf 'n Nonnie" [...] and later [...] "Lulu Arfin' Nanny") and by Al Capp in Li'l Abner, where Punjab became Punjbag, an {{oleaginous}} <b>slob.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Caudill became {{interested}} in the work of William Bradford Shockley Jr., a scientist with controversial eugenicist stances at Stanford University in California. Caudill came to believe in Shockley's theory of [...] "dysgenics," [...] the argument that unintelligent people weaken the genes of a 'race' over time. He felt that [...] "genetic decline" [...] in Eastern Kentucky contributed to issues of poverty. [...] "The <b>slobs</b> continue to multiply," [...] Caudill wrote in a 1975 letter to Time magazine. The editors of Time rejected Caudill's letter.|$|R
50|$|As {{described}} in a film magazine, Disraeli (Arliss), a middle class Jew, has become the British Prime Minister under Queen Victoria and incurs the enmity of nobles and racial <b>slobs.</b> He knows that Russia is angling through diplomacy and intrigue for possession of the Suez Canal and, realizing that unless England secures it, the strength of her empire will be lost. He plays a lone game {{for control of the}} canal and wins. In his final hour of honor at court, those who stood against him claim the honor of having helped him.|$|R
50|$|Joseph Wheeler began {{building}} and repairing {{ships in the}} early 19th century using derricks and slips on the Brickfield <b>slobs</b> off the Strand Road, Cork. By 1829 he had moved to a yard on the Lower Glanmire Road where he built a patent slip. In the 1850s he moved, this time to a purpose built yard at Rushbrooke that was built around a large drydock designed by Sir John Rennie the Younger. While at the Lower Gleanmire Road yard, Wheeler built a number of wooden ships including his largest, the 500-ton Mary Hardy.|$|R
2500|$|Whether or not you're a celebrity—even if you're {{just an old}} <b>slob</b> with a video camera—you don't {{realize you}} shouldn't do it. So you throw the tape {{in the back of}} a dark closet until your old girlfriend remembers it's there because you're famous now and she's not. But if you're not {{prepared}} to do the time, don't do the crime." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{version of}} the slower ball {{also known as the}} <b>SLOB,</b> is {{released}} with the top fingers only. Aimed as a [...] "beamer", the method of delivery causes the ball to drop dramatically in flight and arrive at a yorker length. This was most famously used by Chris Cairns to Chris Read causing him to duck into a full length ball which went on to the stumps.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first version}} of the Windows Update web site (usually {{referred}} to as [...] "v3") did not require any personally-identifiable information {{to be sent to}} Microsoft. [...] In order for the v3 ActiveX control to determine what updates were needed, the entire list of available software on Windows Update was downloaded to the user's computer when they visited the Windows Update web site. [...] As the number of updates offered by Windows Update grew, this resulted in performance concerns. Arie <b>Slob,</b> writing for the Windows-help.net newsletter in March 2003, noted that the size of the update list had exceeded 400KB, which caused delays of more than a minute for dial-up users.|$|E
50|$|Slobs: The Hunters' bloodhound, a {{frequent}} companion on their madcap escapades. <b>Slobs</b> (short for Slobbers) {{was named for}} her tendency to drool nonstop, and she frequently knocks down {{one or both of}} the Hunter children and covers them with kisses. She has saved the children's lives once or twice, using her 102-pound weight to topple almost anyone with ill intent. However, her most frequently used skills are tracking and running for shelter or help (or both). It is mentioned in The Case of The Invisible Knight that she was a gift from Mrs. Hunter at some point prior to her cancer.|$|R
5000|$|During the protests, Grothman was cornered {{by almost}} 200 pro-union protesters yelling [...] "Shame! Shame!" [...] {{outside the state}} capitol building. Grothman {{said he was not}} {{concerned}} about violence at the time, adding that, [...] "They're loud, they'll give you the finger, and they yell at you, but I really think deep down inside they're just mostly college kids having fun, just like they're having fun sleeping with their girlfriends on air mattresses. That's the guts of that crowd." [...] He also described the protesters as [...] "a different breed of person" [...] and [...] "a bunch of <b>slobs</b> taking up the building." ...|$|R
50|$|In the 19th century, dykes {{were built}} and pumping systems {{installed}} {{to drain the}} <b>slobs,</b> producing fine agricultural land below sea level in polders {{similar to those in}} the Netherlands. The size of the harbour was reduced considerably. What was left was mostly shallow and up to today suffers from serious silt problems. The tides and currents of the river frequently shift mud and sand in the harbour. Islands of sand can appear and then disappear {{over the course of a}} few weeks, particularly at the mouth of the harbour. As a result, the harbour is not suitable for large ships and is used mainly by mussel dredgers and pleasure craft.|$|R
2500|$|In 1990, Enfield {{developed}} his BBC sketch show, Harry Enfield's Television Programme, later called Harry Enfield and Chums, with Whitehouse and Kathy Burke. Eschewing the alternative comedy style prevalent at the time, both {{versions of the}} show were indebted to early '70s comedians such as Dick Emery and Morecambe and Wise. Enfield and his co-performers created another group of nationally recognised characters for these shows, such as Stan and Pam Herbert, who use the catchphrase [...] "We are considerably richer than you" [...] (in an exaggerated West-Midlands accent), Tim Nice-But-Dim, The Scousers, Smashie and Nicey, Wayne and Waynetta <b>Slob,</b> Annoying Kid Brother, who grew into Kevin the Teenager, and two old-fashioned presenters, Mr Cholmondley-Warner and Grayson.|$|E
2500|$|Besides Dick Tracy, Capp parodied {{many other}} comic strips in Li'l Abner—including Steve Canyon, Superman (at least twice; first as [...] "Jack Jawbreaker" [...] in 1947, {{and again in}} 1966 as [...] "Chickensouperman"), Mary Worth as [...] "Mary Worm", Peanuts {with [...] "Peewee" [...] a parody of Charlie Brown with [...] "Croopy" [...] parody of Snoopy" [...] {1968} drawn by Bedley Damp a parody of Charles Schulz}, Rex Morgan, M.D., Little Annie Rooney and Little Orphan Annie (in which Punjab became [...] "Punjbag," [...] an {{oleaginous}} <b>slob).</b> Fearless Fosdick—and Capp's other spoofs like [...] "Little Fanny Gooney" [...] (1952) and [...] "Jack Jawbreaker"—were almost certainly an early inspiration for Harvey Kurtzman's Mad Magazine, which began in 1952 as a comic book that specifically parodied other comics in the same distinctive style and subversive manner.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2015, it was {{reported}} that a Dutch school no longer taught about the Holocaust due to the large number of Muslim students who refused to be taught about the subject. At a roundtable discussion with teachers and other educators that was held by the ChristianUnion party, Arie <b>Slob,</b> the party’s parliamentary leader, stated that Holocaust survivors are no longer asked to speak at many Dutch schools, while adding that [...] "I am horrified by this. It is unacceptable that 70 years after the Holocaust, anti-Semitism in the Netherlands is growing." [...] Wissam Feriani, a social studies teacher (who is himself a Muslim), recounted his experiences: [...] "The teacher says Jews, the pupils say Gaza. The teacher says Holocaust, the pupils say it’s all bullshit...It’s always the Jews’ fault. Some pupils say they [...] don’t belong. It’s difficult." ...|$|E
5000|$|To {{counteract}} the Bills' no-huddle offense, the Giants' used a tough-nosed, conservative plan {{on both sides}} of the ball. On offense, the plan was to use a power running game utilizing Ottis Anderson, aided by quarterback rollouts, bootlegs, and play-action fakes. As tight end Mark Bavaro later recalled, [...] "we came out with three tight ends, fat <b>slobs</b> picking you up and moving you and letting you tackle O.J., if you could." [...] This enabled them to take time off the clock and limit Buffalo's possessions. The Giants set a Super Bowl record for time of possession with 40 minutes and 33 seconds, including 22 minutes in the second half.|$|R
500|$|Kidd's {{work for}} the 1954 film Seven Brides for Seven Brothers brought him acclaim. [...] The film was {{directed}} by Stanley Donen, with music by Saul Chaplin and Gene de Paul and lyrics by Johnny Mercer. It was written directly for the screen {{and based on the}} short story [...] "The Sobbin' Women", by Stephen Vincent Benét, which was based in turn on the ancient Roman legend of The Rape of the Sabine Women. He initially turned down the assignment, recalling in 1997: [...] "Here are these <b>slobs</b> living off in the woods. They have no schooling, they are uncouth, there's manure on the floor, the cows come in and out—and they're gonna get up and dance? We'd be laughed out of the house." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Idle Parent by Tom Hodgkinson in 2009 is an {{alternative}} to over-parenting. It has also been serialised in a newspaper column in the Daily Telegraph. The central premise is that children {{can take care of}} themselves most of the time, and that the parents would be happier if they spent more time taking care of themselves too. Hodgkinson's idle parenting [...] "does not refer to <b>slobbing</b> out or giving up, but rather to letting go, going with the flow, a wise and merry detachment. It is, in Alduous Huxley's phrase, an 'active resignation'." [...] IP {{does not have to be}} costly: Many activities are free, such as lighting a fire; while others are cheap, such as buying 10-year-old video tapes from charity shops.|$|R
