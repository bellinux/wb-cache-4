40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the crop water demand and deficit of <b>spring</b> {{highland}} <b>barley</b> and discuss suitable irrigation systems for different regions in Tibet, China. Long-term trends in reference crop evapotranspiration and crop water demand were analyzed in different regions, together with crop water demand and deficit of <b>spring</b> highland <b>barley</b> under different precipitation frequencies. Results showed that precipitation trends during growth stages did not benefit the growth of <b>spring</b> highland <b>barley.</b> The crop coefficient of <b>spring</b> highland <b>barley</b> in Tibet was 0. 87 and crop water demand Was 389. 0 mm. In general, a water deficit was found in Tibet, because precipitation was lower than water consumption of <b>spring</b> highland <b>barley.</b> The most severe water deficit were in the jointing to heading stage and the heading to wax ripeness stage, which are the most important growth stages for spring highland barley; water deficit in these two stages would be harmful to the yield. Water deficit showed different characteristics in different regions. In conclusion, irrigation systems may be more successful if based on an analysis of water deficit within different growth stages and in different regions...|$|R

The effect of constant (18 °C) and daily fluc- tuating (18 / 16 °C) temperature with a long photoperiod was also examined in a set of barley varieties including winter, facultative and <b>spring</b> <b>barleys.</b> Dicktoo with facultative growth habit was more sensi- tive to unfavourable conditions than Kompolti korai with winter growth habit; the flowering of Dicktoo was significantly delayed by sub- and supra-optimal temperatures and low light intensity accompanied by higher or fluctuating temperatures. The optimal temperature at flowering was also significantly lower for Dicktoo than for Kompolti korai (16. 0 °C vs. 21. 0 °C, respectively). Plant development was the fastest when there was no fluctuating environmental factor in the growing conditions and was signifi- cantly delayed with application of photo cycle. The addition of thermo cycle to photo cycle had an even stronger delaying effect. Facultative barleys were the most sensitive, followed by winter <b>barleys,</b> while <b>spring</b> <b>barleys</b> the least sensitive to the introduction of thermo cycle...|$|R

Nine predictor variables were calculated using hourly temperature and relative humidity during the 10 days preceding full head spike emergence. Simple logistic regression models were developed using these predictor variables based on a binary threshold for DON of 0. 5 mg/kg. Four of the nine models had sensitivity greater than 80 %, and specificity of these models ranged from 67 to 84 % (n = 150). The most useful predictor was the joint effect of average hourly temperature and a weighted duration of uninterrupted hours (h) with relative humidity {{greater than or equal}} to 90 %.
