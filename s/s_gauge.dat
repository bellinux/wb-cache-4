40|$|This cultural-historical {{reading of}} Les Liaisons dangereuses (1782) situates {{it in the}} context of the 1780 s {{engagement}} with weights and measures reform in France. The protagonists of the novel resort to a language of weights and measures in order to appraise their world which is fraught with material, sexual and ideological signification. Contemporary discussions of weights and measures often incriminated the seigneurial regime as principal abuser of the system, invoking in the process philosophical connotations of “the just measure” or socially responsible moderation and equity. As well, the human body remained at this time the principal benchmark for constituting the systems of measurement with which the French of the 1780 <b>s</b> <b>gauged</b> and appraised their physical and imaginative environments. Hence, Choderlos de Laclos’s famous letter-novel of 1782 provides a telling case study allowing us to determine how far the uniquely resonant universe of contemporary fiction reflects and inflects the metrological concerns of its society as well as potentially suggesting ways in which people still measure and weigh the world atavistically, according to pre-metric and pre-decimal, corporeal means...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} perturbative gauge {{invariance}} formulated exclusively {{by means of}} asymptotic fields is used to construct massive gauge theories. We consider the interactions of r massive and <b>s</b> massless <b>gauge</b> fields together with (r+s) fermionic ghost and anti-ghost fields. First order gauge invariance requires the introduction of unphysical scalars (Goldstone bosons) and fixes their trilinear couplings. At second order additional physical scalars (Higgs fields) are necessary, their coupling is further restricted at third order. In case of one physical scalar all couplings are determined by gauge invariance, including the Higgs potential. For three massive and one massless gauge field the SU(2) × U(1) electroweak theory comes out as the unique solution. Comment: 20 pages, latex, no figure...|$|R

50|$|In 1938, Gilbert {{purchased}} American Flyer, {{a struggling}} manufacturer of toy trains. Gilbert re-designed the entire product line, producing 1:64 scale trains running on <b>S</b> <b>gauge</b> track. At the same time, Gilbert introduced {{a line of}} HO scale trains, which were primarily marketed under the brand name Gilbert HO. During the World War II period, virtually all American companies, {{no matter what they}} originally produced, converted to making some form or another of war material. A. C. Gilbert was no different, and by 1942 was producing equipment for military aircraft. After the war ended, Gilbert went back to producing toys, introducing S scale model railroad trains running on <b>S</b> <b>gauge</b> 2 rail track in 1946, mostly in response to the shortcomings of O scale utilized by Lionel and Marx. These newer American Flyer trains were smaller and proportioned more realistically than either the pre-war American Flyer trains or its post-war competition. Although these new trains were popular, Lionel outsold American Flyer nearly 2 to 1.|$|E
50|$|Lionel re-introduced <b>S</b> <b>gauge</b> {{trains and}} {{accessories}} under the American Flyer name in 1979.

S-Helper Service, another major <b>S</b> <b>gauge</b> manufacturer of locomotives, rolling stock, track and other products, began operations in 1989 and delivered their first S products in 1990. In 2013, S-Helper Service was sold to MTH Electric Trains. And while the S scale market has seen a number of brass model manufacturers, today the major brass model supplier in S scale/S gauge is River Raisin Models. Today's S gauge/S scale modelers have a greater selection and higher quality products, {{from a wide range of}} manufacturers, that at any time in the past. In addition to the basics of locomotives, rolling stock, and track, various manufacturers now offer S scale structures, detail parts, figures, other scenic items, bridges, and more.|$|E

In the course of our general investigation we construct a lattice operator that measures non-abelian discrete charge, and is related to a non-abelian generalization of the 't Hooft loop operator.
