Among those aboard was <b>stewardess</b> Violet Jessop, who would repeat the experience four years later when she survived the sinking of one of Titanics sister ships, , in the First World War. Collapsible boat C was launched at 01:40 from a now largely deserted area of the deck, as most of those on deck had moved to the stern of the ship.

5|$|Audrey Hepburn (4 May 1929– 20 January 1993) was a British {{actress who}} had an {{extensive}} career in film, television, and on the stage from 1948 to 1993.

Hepburn is also remembered as both a film and style icon. Her debut was as a flight <b>stewardess</b> in the 1948 Dutch film Dutch in Seven Lessons. Hepburn then performed on the British stage as a chorus girl in the musicals High Button Shoes (1948), and Sauce Tartare (1949). Two years later she made her Broadway debut as the title character in the play Gigi. Hepburn's Hollywood debut as a runaway princess in William Wyler's Roman Holiday (1953) opposite Gregory Peck made her a star. For her performance she received the Academy Award for Best Actress, the BAFTA Award for Best British Actress, and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture– Drama. In 1954 she played a chauffeur's daughter caught in a love triangle in Billy Wilder's romantic comedy Sabrina opposite Humphrey Bogart and William Holden.

25|$|Dressed in {{a version}} of the Sarong Kebaya {{designed}} by Pierre Balmain in 1968, the uniform of the Singapore Girl has remained largely unchanged. Stewards previously wore light-blue business jackets and grey trousers. Since June 2008, this has been redesigned by Christophe Galibert, artistic Director of Balmain Uniformes. The new steward's uniform now features a single-breasted navy blue suit (jacket and trousers), a sky blue shirt and different coloured striped ties.

50|$|The Ritzes were {{appearing}} at New Orleans Roosevelt Hotel in December 1965 when Al {{died of a}} sudden heart attack. Harry and Jimmy were devastated, as the trio had always been very close.

The last appearances of the Ritz Brothers as a team (minus Al) were in the mid-1970s films Blazing <b>Stewardesses</b> and Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood, a spoof of the old Rin Tin Tin and Lassie movies. In Blazing <b>Stewardesses</b> the Ritzes were cast as replacements for The Three Stooges, who dropped out of the film when Moe Howard's declining health forced the trio to cancel. (Contrary to many accounts, Moe was still alive when Blazing <b>Stewardesses</b> filmed in March 1975; he was simply too ill to work.

5000|$|In the 1960s, <b>stewardesses,</b> as {{flight attendants}} were known, were {{considered}} glamorous and exotic adventurers. Frank Sinatra's song Come Fly with Me {{gave birth to}} the jet set. Adding to the allure, Bernard Glemser's novel, Girl on a Wing, and the British movie based on it, Come Fly with Me (1963), depicted <b>stewardesses</b> as stylish seekers of romance. Wearing custom-fitted uniforms, attendants were career women, whose looks, marital status and childlessness were guarded by industry executives, much as Hollywood starlets had been. On the one hand, they were to project an ideal of womanhood, but on the other, they were used to sell airline travel through their sexuality. The double-standard that they faced as well as the glamorous lifestyle they lived, shot to the best-seller's list with the publication in 1967 of the book, Coffee, Tea or Me? In 1963, <b>stewardesses</b> who held a press conference on airlines' policy of retiring <b>stewardesses</b> at 32, caught the attention of the country. The press conference focused attention on the airlines narrow standard of [...] "feminine allure".|$|R
