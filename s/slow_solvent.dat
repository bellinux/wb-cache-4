30|$|In the {{dip-coating}} process presented here, the polarity {{difference between}} PDMS and SiO 2 regions can induce selective localization of SWCNTs along the strip direction.

As the pulling velocity is sufficiently <b>slow,</b> the <b>solvent</b> starts to evaporate mostly from the pattern edges, leading to convective transport of the SWCNTs {{that is similar to}} the well-known coffee-ring flow [31]. In addition, the confined geometry of a topographically patterned surface strongly influences the direction of evaporation, so that the liquid layer dries and forms aligned bundles of SWCNTs along the nano-strips [32]. This directional evaporation significantly enhances align accuracy and pattern fidelity as compared to other solution-based methods (e.g., spin-coating, dipping).
