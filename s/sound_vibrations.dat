25|$|During operation, {{light from}} a laser source travels through an optical fiber to {{illuminate}} {{the surface of a}} reflective diaphragm. <b>Sound</b> <b>vibrations</b> of the diaphragm modulate the intensity of light reflecting off the diaphragm in a specific direction. The modulated light is then transmitted over a second optical fiber to a photo detector, which transforms the intensity-modulated light into analog or digital audio for transmission or recording. Fiber optic microphones possess high dynamic and frequency range, similar to the best high fidelity conventional microphones.|$|E
25|$|A {{new type}} of laser {{microphone}} is a device that uses a laser beam and smoke or vapor to detect <b>sound</b> <b>vibrations</b> in free air. On 25 August 2009, U.S. patent 7,580,533 issued for a Particulate Flow Detection Microphone based on a laser-photocell pair with a moving stream of smoke or vapor in the laser beam's path. Sound pressure waves cause disturbances in the smoke that in turn cause variations {{in the amount of}} laser light reaching the photo detector.

25|$|A contact {{microphone}} picks up vibrations {{directly from a}} solid surface or object, as opposed to <b>sound</b> <b>vibrations</b> carried through air. One use for this is to detect sounds of a very low level, such as those from small objects or insects. The microphone commonly consists of a magnetic (moving coil) transducer, contact plate and contact pin. The contact plate is placed directly on the vibrating part of a musical instrument or other surface, and the contact pin transfers vibrations to the coil. Contact microphones {{have been used to}} pick up the sound of a snail's heartbeat and the footsteps of ants. A portable version of this microphone has recently been developed. A throat microphone is a variant of the {{contact microphone}} that picks up speech directly from a person's throat, which it is strapped to. This lets the device be used in areas with ambient sounds that would otherwise make the speaker inaudible.|$|E
25|$|The proneural genes {{also have}} an {{important}} role in the development of distinct types of sensory organs, namely chordotonal organs (proprioceptorsthat detect mechanical and <b>sound</b> <b>vibrations)</b> and external sensory organs. Members of achaete-scute complex, such as achaete and scute, as well as ‘’atonal’’ and ‘’daughterless’’ confer to ectodermal cells the ability to become sensory mother cells (SMCs). In the development of sensory organs there are two main phases: determination and differentiation that may not be mechanistically separable. Proneural proteins are involved in both processes, through the activation of the downstream “differentiating genes” that in turn regulate the induction of sensory-organ-subtype characteristics. The specification of sensory organs by proneural genes is a complex process, since they elicit different cellular contexts. For instance, in Drosophila, atonal (ato) can promote the development of chordotonal organs, for the receptors of olfactory sense organs, depending on the imaginal disc in which it is expressed. In Drosophila’s embryogenesis, the proneural gene achaete is expressed in well-determined regions as in the endoderm, being responsible for the formation of particular sensory organs in the adult and larvae. According to Ruíz-Gomes and Ghysen (1993), this expression occurs in two distinct phases: a competent state, in which the proneural gene is expressed in a cell cluster; a determined state, in which a specific cell accumulate high levels of ‘’ac’’ transcripts, originating a neural precursor. The function of each of the ASC complex genes varies with the development state (larvae or adult). For example, in the adult state the ac and sc genes promote the differentiation of two sets of complementary sensory organs and ase gene as a minimal function, while in the larvae state ac and sc genes affect the same set of sensory organs and ase is responsible for the determination of a complementary set.|$|E

6000|$|Section 116. The eighth nerve {{runs from}} the brain case (Cr.), into the periotic bone, and is {{distributed}} to the several portions of this labyrinth. In an ordinary fish this internal ear is the sole auditory organ we should find; the sound-waves would travel through the water to the elastic cranium and so reach and affect the nerves. But in all air-frequenting animals this original plan of an ear has to be added to, to fit it to the much fainter <b>sound</b> <b>vibrations</b> of the compressible and far less elastic air. A [...] "receiving apparatus" [...] is needed, and is supplied by the ear-drum, middle ear, or tympanic cavity (T.). In the mammal {{there is also a}} collecting ear trumpet (the ear commonly so-called), the external ear, and external auditory meatus (e.a.m.). A tightly stretched membrane, the tympanic membrane, separates this from the drum. A chain of small bones, the malleus (m.), the incus (i.), the os orbiculare (o.or.), a very small bone, and a stirrup-shaped stapes, swing across the tympanum, from the tympanic membrane to the internal ear. At two points the bony investment of this last is incomplete-- at the fenestra rotunda (f.r.), and at the fenestra ovalis, (f.o.), into which latter the end of the stapes fits, and so communicates the <b>sound</b> <b>vibrations</b> of the tympanic membrane to the endolymph. A passage, the Eustachian tube, communicates between the tympanic cavity and the pharynx (Ph.), and serves to equalize the pressure {{on either side of the}} drum-head. A comparative study of the ears of the vertebrata brings to light the fact that, as we descend in the animal scale, the four ear ossicles are replaced by large bones and cartilages connected with the jaw, and the drum and Eustachian tube by a gill slit. We have, in fact, in the ear, as the student will perceive in the sequel, an essentially aquatic auditory organ, added to and patched up to fit the new needs of a life out of water.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Noise and {{vibrations}} {{have over}} the last two decades been regarded as important environmental health problems. Regulations regarding acoustic as well as vibration levels have therefore become more strict. High levels of <b>sound</b> and <b>vibration</b> in different means for personal transportation are often regarded as a important environmental problem. The public alertness of health risks in conjunction with <b>sound</b> and <b>vibration</b> exposure has indirectly, become an important sales argument for manufacturers. Governments and health organizations are already regulating the time and level of <b>sound</b> and <b>vibration</b> that the human body is allowed to be exposed to. These regulations are becoming more and more strict, wherefore new methods for <b>sound</b> and <b>vibration</b> attenuation always are in demand. The new directives from the European Union (EU), from 2005, regarding heavy vehicles (loaders, trucks etc.) constitute an example. Such regulations state that it is not the manufacturer of the heavy vehicle but the employer who has to ensure that the maximum <b>sound</b> and <b>vibration</b> limits, both on a daily and weekly basis, are not exceeded...|$|R
