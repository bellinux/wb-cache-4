Focusing upon the perceptive design of the study, a survey was conducted to know the significance of the three metaphors in the interactional settings of the <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> classrooms. This study targeted <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> teachers’ attitudes towards the three delimited metaphors [...] The respondents consisted of 200 <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> teachers drawn from the English Language Centers of the Saudi Universities. A 22 -item Likert-scale questionnaire was designed to know the opinions of <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> teachers about the dynamic use of metaphors {{in the context of the}}  Saudi EFL classroom. The findings of the study reflected that the <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> teachers represented by the cohort of this study presented a mixed attitudes towards the utilization of the three delimited metaphors. The findings show that a limited exposure of instructional metaphor may be one of the reasons of the poor performance of the <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> teachers. A limited exposure of  acquisition metaphor may also be damaging the dynamics of teacher student interactional and instructional patterns inside the <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> classrooms. The findings further  show that the teachers’ imbalanced use of class time and hardly any reliance on the coordinated interaction might be due to the limited exposure to the latest techniques embedded in the socialization metaphor. Although policy makers do not acknowledge the fundamental role of metaphors into classroom pedagogies, the participant-teachers recommended professional use of all the metaphors to achieve prerequisite dynamics of the EFL classrooms by fully acknowledging the applicability, appropriateness, and practicality of all the variables of acquisition metaphor...|$|R

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Vocabulary {{learning}} {{is one of}} the fundamental parts of acquiring any language. Almost all L 2 learners start their L 2 education by learning primary words without which they cannot communicate using the L 2 language. Vocabulary {{learning is}} a major challenge for foreign language learners. This research concentrates on the difficulties encountered by <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> learners in their vocabulary learning, which weaken their general EFL performance. Practically, it investigates what vocabulary learning strategies are most effective and the reasons for using or not using those strategies in each stage of vocabulary learning. The main aim {{of this study is to}} explore which strategies <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> learners use at each stage of vocabulary-learning (Encountering new words - Getting the word form - Getting the word meaning - Consolidating word form and meaning in memory - Using the word). This study also gives special attention to the ways learners can be made more aware of the significance of autonomous vocabulary learning. The research aims to generate findings that could encourage <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> educators and authorities to support the use of more efficient vocabulary learning strategies. The study employs two methods for collecting information: a structured questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. The research investigates Saudi learners’ experiences via a structured questionnaire, which was administered to 200 <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> students. This was followed up with interview sessions involving 20 of the participants. The purpose of the study is to identify the vocabulary learning strategies that <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> students do and do not use in every academic grade and the actual reasons for using or not using those strategies in every stage of the five essential vocabulary-learning stages; to measure how eager those students are to learn more effective vocabulary-learning strategies; and to explore the extent to which <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> teachers encourage their students to use more effective vocabulary learning strategies. It is hoped that the results of this study can be beneficial to all ESL/EFL learners worldwide and to the field of linguistics in general since the issues <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> learners encounter are similar to those encountered by ESL/EFL learners worldwide...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} the factors that hinder the {{acquisition}} of the past verb forms in (past simple form, past progressive form, past perfect form) by Saudi learners of English. This study argues that Arabic and English share similar grammatical characteristics in the past verb forms. It also sheds light {{on the role of}} these similarities in facilitating the acquisition process of the targeted forms. This is a mixed-method study conducted on thirty-six <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> learners. The participants were assigned to two groups: group A (received treatment session about the past verb forms in English and highlighted their counterparts in Arabic) and group B (received treatment session about the past verb forms in English only). Three types of tasks were employed: multiple choice, gap-filling, and storytelling, and they were conducted at three periods: pre intervention, post intervention, and delayed test. A randomly-selected group was invited for stimulated recall interviews immediately after the delayed test. The interviews were conducted individually. The study answered two research questions and hypotheses: RQ 1 : To what extent does linking the similarities in the past verb forms between English and Arabic help <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> learners to acquire these forms? H 1 : Drawing the <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> learners’ attention to the similarities in the past verb forms between Arabic and English facilitates their acquisition. RQ 2 : Does L 1 Arabic influence the choice of past verb forms in English for <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> learners? (a) What is the impact on explicit and implicit knowledge? (b) What is the impact on receptive and productive knowledge? H 2 : <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> learners consciously resort to their first language when they lack the correct past verb form in English. The results show that the intervention that highlighted the similarities in past verb forms between Arabic and English helped the participants to acquire the targeted forms.

40|$|In {{computer-mediated}} communication (CMC) environments, {{there is}} an extensive body of research which has looked at the nature of language learning of English as a foreign language (EFL) students within and beyond the classroom setting. However, most of this {{research has focused on}} the pattern of student-student interactions and extensively on the modality of synchronous CMC. The nature of instructor-student CMC interactions on online discussion forums remains unexplored in both L 2 and <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> learning contexts. This study investigates how <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> students perform their language and project their social presence when they interact with (as opposed to without) their instructor in online discussion forums. Throughout an entire academic semester in a prestigious university in Saudi Arabia, 49 <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> students interacted in student-student and instructor-student online exchanges to discuss argumentative topics in their educational discussion forums. The present study employed a mixed-methods research approach and data were collected from transcript of participants’ online interactions, questionnaires, and interviews. Students’ L 2 performance was examined using a textual analysis method to determine linguistic fluency, lexical density, linguistic accuracy, and grammatical complexity (Wolfe-Quintero, Inagaki, & Kim, 1998). To examine their social presence, the study applied a content analysis method by using the model of social presence in the framework of a community of inquiry (Garrison, Anderson, & Archer, 2000, 2001). The role of the instructor in instructor-student online interactions was examined qualitatively using a content analysis method by means of a template which was developed during the study. The study findings show that in student-student online exchanges, <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> students produced significantly higher rates of lexical density and social presence but lower rates of linguistic accuracy. Conversely, in instructor-student online exchanges, students produced significantly higher rates of linguistic accuracy but lower rates of lexical density and social presence. No significant differences were found in students’ fluency and grammatical complexity between the two phases of online exchanges. The instructors’ presence and scaffolding were found to influence Saudi students in instructor-student online exchanges. Students noticed their language errors, paid attention to linguistic accuracy, learnt new lexical and grammatical features, and engaged in reflective interactions. Furthermore, Saudi students were found to have positive perceptions towards instructor-student online exchanges and they valued their instructors’ online interactions as helpful for their L 2 development. The present study concluded that instructor-student online exchanges provided <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> students more opportunities to develop their language than student-student online exchanges. Finally, some implications for L 2 performance, social presence, {{and the role of the}} instructor in online discussion forums are discussed and recommendations for future research are presented...|$|R
30|$|In ESL/EFL {{learning}} contexts, {{it is an}} {{evident that}} computer technologies have been viewed and realized as significant and useful learning tools especially among the ESL/EFL learners at schools and universities. With the quick globalization {{in the field of}} education, English language has become a vital factor for the academic and professional success of students whose first language is not English. In Saudi Arabia, where English is studied as a foreign language, <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> learners have realized the importance of using computer technologies in learning English. Mishal Al Shammari (2007) asserts that <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> students have tendency to use computer technologies in learning English and demonstrated positive stands and reactions towards the general use of CALL as an effective technique to develop the process of learning English. Consequently, the results of the current study are useful and beneficial for both students and teachers in schools and universities. With regard to students, they need to be exposed to computer tools to equip themselves such as motivation, skill, experience, self-confidence, and positive attitudes to participate in developing the process of learning English. As for teachers, they should offer assistance to students to encourage their perception of the computer tools. The teachers and facilitators should adopt a comprehensive method toward the teaching of computer tools to enable their students to meet their own strategic needs in English language learning. Thus, the findings of the present study enabled the researchers to draw up several useful implications in an attempt to improve the use of computer technologies among the <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> learners.|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{reports on}} three corpus-based studies in a Saudi {{university}} context. The first {{study is a}} computer-aided error analysis (CEA) of a corpus of Saudi English majors’ writing. The second and third studies employ the DDL approach to teach collocations and lexical phrases. The errors in the Saudi learner corpus (SLC) were tagged following the Louvain Error Tagging Manual 1. 2. The CEA revealed that the ten largest error subcategories were (Form, Spelling), then (Grammar, Verb Tense), (Lexical, Single), (Grammar, Articles), (Grammar, Verb Number), (Grammar, Noun Number), (Word Redundant, Singular), (Word, Missing), (Lexical, Phrase) and finally (Punctuation, Missing). These error types are analysed qualitatively to identify the linguistic features {{that seem to be}} problematic for <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> learners. Multiword units are notoriously difficult for L 2 learners, and the <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> context is no exception; {{in the second and third}} studies a number of collocations and lexical phrases were selected from the SLC to be taught using DDL paper-based and dictionary-based materials. The results showed that learners in general learn better under the DDL treatment. Learning gains as a result of the DDL instructional condition in short-term delayed posttests were not significantly better than the dictionary-based instructional condition in the case of collocations, but they were significantly higher for the lexical phrases. The DDL long-term delayed posttests results were significantly better than the dictionary results for both the collocations and lexical phrases. A questionnaire and retrospective interviews were used to investigate students’ and teachers’ attitudes and the results encouragingly revealed that they felt positive about the DDL materials. The data shed light on strengths and weaknesses of the DDL and the traditional approaches. The thesis closes with a discussion of the pedagogical implications, particularly with reference to the use of corpus tools and corpus-based materials in the <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> context...|$|R
40|$|This {{study has}} been {{undertaken}} using an interpretive methodology {{in order to examine}} the socially constructed views of <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> teachers and their decision-making with regards to the appropriate cultural models for <b>EFL</b> textbooks in <b>Saudi</b> public schools. The study also examines the factors affecting the teachers’ views and how they apply their beliefs in their classrooms. In addition, the study will also examine if the <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> teachers have any concerns about what they have been through and examined and accordingly investigates how they address their pedagogical decision-making in the classroom. Moreover, this study is interested in looking at EFL teachers as local teachers teaching a global language. In view of the exploratory nature of this study and its context-specificity, the naturalistic orientation of interpretive and social constructivism as an epistemological stance were selected. The research design employed a concurrent mixed methods design using an adapted version of Cresswell (1996). In this study, the participants were <b>Saudi</b> Arabian <b>EFL</b> teachers from one city in Saudi Arabia teaching in all of the three public education levels (primary, intermediate and secondary). The data collected were both qualitative (interviews and open-ended questionnaires) and quantitative (close-ended questionnaires). For the interviews, 14 male and female teachers equally interviewed, whereas for the questionnaires 280 male and female participated. The data collection of both data qualitative and quantitative occurred at the same time during my field journey in 2009 in Saudi Arabia. I used the SPSS descriptive statistics for the analysing the quantitative data and used exploratory content analysis for the qualitative data. The study findings revealed that the <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> teachers were not satisfied with the cultural content currently promoted in the Textbooks as they inappropriately contradict the local cultural values. Thus, they believe that for a better cultural content, the textbooks should therefore include a mixture of different cultures that do not mismatch with the local. And as they are controlled by some educational and social factors, they are limited to practice what they think is appropriate to apply in the classroom, therefore, their decision-making in this regards to some extent are to be controlled. In addition, the findings of the current study revealed that the <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> teachers show their openness to other cultures based on their glocal position as local Saudis teaching a global language. The conclusion of the study has some suggestion and implications to improve the cultural content of the EFL textbooks as well as implications for the EFL teachers in general and their practices and decision-making with regards to the textbook. Furthermore, the study proposed a model for the appropriate EFL textbooks for each educational level and can be applied locally in the Saudi context and globally for other similar context around the world.

The study also delineates {{gender differences in the}} respondents’ speech as opposed to studies that only examined speech act output by native and non-native speakers of English. To this end, the study employs a Discourse Completion Task (DCT) that consists of 10 situations designed to test how the respondents would react if they imagine that they belong to different types of social status whether higher, lower or equal. In addition, social distance and power have been taken into consideration in designing the ten situations included in the test used in this study. The results reveal that Illocutionary Force Indicating Device (IFID) is the most used apology strategy by the Saudi respondents followed by downgrading responsibility (DR), upgrader, offer of repair, taking on responsibility and then verbal redress. The results also reveal that gender has a great impact on the use of apology strategies in various ways. For instance, the IFID strategy and the upgrader strategy are used by males more than their female counterparts, whereas females use the DR strategy more than their male counterparts. It has been argued that some of the respondents’ answers to the test were influenced by their mother tongue, as reported in previous studies conducted on apology strategies. The study discusses the results elicited via the DCT and compares them with those of previous studies on apology strategies and other speech acts.

To achieve this, the researcher designed a multiple-choice test to measure <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> learners’ ability to recognise the correct English synonym in contextualised sentences. In order to test whether the English proficiency level of the participants {{plays a role in}} their comprehension of English synonyms, the participants were divided {{on the basis of their}} scores on the Oxford Placement Test into two groups: 20 Advanced Learners (ALs) and 20 Intermediate Learners (ILs). Twenty native speakers of English (NSs) acted as the control group. The native speakers’ answers on the multiple-choice test were considered as the accurate answers. The answers provided by the ALs and ILs were compared to those provided by the NSs to determine whether the answers of the former approximate those of the latter. A Chi-square test was employed to determine whether the differences between the three groups, ALs, ILs and NSs on the multiple-choice test were statistically significant. The results reveal that the answers supplied by the ILs differed statistically from those of NSs on all items on the multiple-choice test, whereas those provided by the ALs differed significantly from those of the NSs on eight items. The results also show that participants’ English proficiency level may not have played a role in their ability to recognise the correct synonym on all items on the test. The researcher argued that the main sources of error were interference habits from the participants’ first language (L 1), lack of awareness of the semantic differences between the synonyms in English and lack of familiarity with English collocations.

Only the Deflection response category of both American and Saudi response types was significantly affected by both the complimenter's social status and social distance. Specifically, the higher the complimenter's social status and the closer the complimenter's social distance, the more frequently both Americans and Saudis deflected. In response to the effect of gender, only the Acceptance response category of both American and Saudi response types was significantly affected by the respondent's gender and the gender-pairings of respondent and complimenter. However, Saudis accepted more and rejected less when the respondent and complimenter were of the same sex, and vice versa, whereas Americans behaved in exactly the opposite way.;Regarding pragmatic transfer, the results suggest that the <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> learners group respondents transferred the frequency patterns of Saudis in performing bald acceptance, formulaic acceptance, duty, and return response types. Similarly, they transferred some of the distinguishing cultural modes of Saudi Arabic to their compliment responses expressed in English...|$|R
30|$|Another {{study by}} Al Shammari (2007) {{researched}} the <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> students’ reactions towards CALL at Institute of Public Administration (IPA) in Saudi Arabia. The study {{based on a}} survey of questionnaires as tools for data collection that distributed to 1465 participants who were undergraduate learners of English in four campuses in Saudi Arabia. Among the respondents, 1310 were males and 155 were females. The results identified the general attitudes of the participants toward the use of CALL in learning English as well as certain gender-based discrepancies among the participants in each university campus. Furthermore, the findings showed positive attitudes toward the use of CALL as an active tool to learn English, with females showing more positive attitudes than males toward the use of CALL to learn various English language skills.|$|R

The present study explored attitudes of <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> undergraduates toward the use of video-podcasts integration in listening comprehension. Moreover, {{the study also examined}} students’ attitude {{from the perspective of the}} number of video-podcasts they received in their instructions. Samples included 90 English major male undergraduates divided into three groups. The three groups received five (5), ten (10) and 15 video-podcasts in their listening classes before they answered an attitude questionnaire. ANOVA results revealed that the students had positive attitudes towards the use of video-podcasts in listening. However, no significant difference was found between the attitudes of the three experimental groups who received varied number of video-podcasts in their instructions...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{consciousness}} {{to the need to}} know English among the Saudi Arabian peoples. This is apparent in the painstaking efforts of the policy makers in bringing in technology as an aid to teachers, institutions diverting huge funding to the field and encouraging research in the area. Learning outcomes, however, do not reflect these efforts. This study is an effort to zero in on factors that are impeding the expected proficiency of the <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> learner with special reference to the use of CALL. Having done this, the study makes pertinent recommendations with the larger aim of bringing the EFL learners to level playing ground in the global language scene.

30|$|Among {{the three}} groups of barriers, the {{participants}} identified the lack of skill (score of 3.4556 of 5) as the most influential barrier on participants’ attitudes and restricting their use of computer technologies. The findings are inconsistent and generally contradictory with those of Kung (2005), who declared {{that the lack of}} the equipment is the most identified obstacle. The same findings are in accordance with those presented by Kung (2005), Alaugab (2007) and Almuqayteeb (2009), since they all discovered that the lack of equipment was reported as a barrier influencing the subjects' reactions and restricting the use of computer technologies. In the case of the current study, however, the lack of skill has been identified as the most important obstacle influencing the <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> learners' stands and restricting the use of computer technologies in learning English.|$|R
30|$|Another {{significant}} {{aspect of}} the problem is the insufficient exposure to computer technologies, which deters full utilization of computer technology devices by many <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> learners. Most students have minimal or no experience in using computers and those who know how to use computers employ these merely for entertainment and communication. Information communication technology (ICT) implementation without preparation and training on how to deal and use these technology tools properly might affect the learning process. The successful use of technologies can be largely detected in the attitudes and willingness of students to use these technology tools, which could lead to the successful utilization of these tools in the classroom. Albirini (2006) supports this view and states that the attitudes and willingness of learners toward using technology mainly value the successful use of technology in the educational settings.|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} I {{investigated}} the relative effects of different reading methods on the comprehension performance of <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> 10 th grade male students. The scores {{of participants who}} read three comparable passages in three ways (oral, silent and subvocalizing) were compared. Results revealed {{a significant difference between}} oral reading and subvocalization, and between oral reading and silent reading. Oral reading had the greatest effect on comprehension performance among the three reading methods examined. All groups reported that oral reading was the most preferred reading method with the majority of respondents feeling the style best supported comprehension. Feedback suggested that oral reading was preferred specifically because it helps in memorizing words and texts, concentration, and practicing and pronouncing words for real world encounters. It is recommended that second language teachers and students use all available reading methods in order to identify which method best serves their study objectives...|$|R
40|$|It is {{no doubt}} that teacher written {{feedback}} plays an essential role in teaching writing skill. The present study, by use of questionnaire, investigates <b>Saudi</b> <b>EFL</b> students' and teachers' preferences and attitudes towards written error corrections. The study also aims at identifying the difficulties encountered by teachers and students during the feedback process. The questionnaire findings reveal that both teachers and students have positive attitudes towards written error correction. The study also shows that while teachers and students share such common preferences as the importance of error correction and the types of errors, there are considerable discrepancies as to the techniques of error correction. For instance, students favor the overall correction, whereas most teachers do not. However, the results show that students prefer teacher correction to peer and self-correction. Moreover, both the teachers and students have encountered a number of difficulties, so suggestions have been investigated so as to deal with the problems...|$|R
