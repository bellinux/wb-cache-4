40|$|ObjectiveIn late presenters with {{transposition}} of {{the great}} arteries, intact ventricular septum, and regressing left ventricle, left ventricular retraining by pulmonary artery banding and aortopulmonary shunt {{is characterized by a}} stormy postoperative course and high costs. Ductal stenting in the cardiac catheterization laboratory is conceptualized to retrain the left ventricle with less morbidity. MethodsRecanalization and transcatheter stenting of patent ductus arteriosus was performed in patients with transposition to induce pressure and volume overload to the regressing left ventricle. Serial echocardiographic monitoring of left ventricular shape, mass, free wall thickness, and volumes was done, and once the left ventricle was adequately prepared, an arterial switch was performed. The ductal stent was removed and the remaining surgical steps were similar to a 1 -stage arterial switch operation. Postoperative course, need for inotropic agents, and left ventricular function were monitored. ResultsDuctal stenting in 2 patients aged 3 months resulted in improvement of indexed left ventricular mass from 18. 9 to 108. 5 g/m 2, left ventricular free wall thickness from 2. 5 to 4. 8 mm, and indexed left ventricular volumes from 7. 6 to 29. 5 mL/m 2 within 3 weeks. Both patients underwent arterial <b>switch</b> (<b>bypass</b> times 125 and 158 minutes) uneventfully, needed inotropic agents and ventilatory support for 3 days, and were discharged in 8 and 10 days. ConclusionsDuctal stenting is a less morbid method of left ventricular retraining in transposition {{of the great}} arteries with regressed left ventricle. Its major advantages lie in avoiding pulmonary artery distortion and neoaortic valve regurgitation resulting from banding and also in avoiding thoracotomy...|$|E

This {{should be a}} net gain in reliability, because the <b>bypass</b> <b>switch</b> is a simpler device than the monitoring appliance, and because it is designed for fault-tolerance.

50|$|A <b>bypass</b> <b>switch</b> (or <b>bypass</b> TAP) is a {{hardware}} device {{that provides a}} fail-safe access port for an in-line active security appliance such as an intrusion prevention system (IPS), next generation firewall (NGFW), etc. Active, in-line security appliances are single points of failure in live computer networks because if the appliance loses power, experiences a software failure, or is taken off-line for updates or upgrades, traffic can no longer flow through the critical link. The <b>bypass</b> <b>switch</b> or <b>bypass</b> tap removes this point of failure by automatically 'switching traffic via bypass mode' to keep the critical network link up.|$|R

50|$|A <b>bypass</b> <b>switch</b> {{has four}} ports. Two network ports create an in-line {{connection}} {{in the network}} link {{that is to be}} monitored. This connection is fully passive; if the <b>bypass</b> <b>switch</b> itself loses power, traffic continues to flow unimpeded through the link. Two monitor ports are used to connect the in-line monitoring appliance. During normal operation, the <b>bypass</b> <b>switch</b> passes all network traffic through the appliance as if it were directly in-line itself. But when the in-line appliance loses power, is disconnected, or otherwise fails, the <b>bypass</b> <b>switch</b> passes traffic directly between its network ports, bypassing the appliance, and ensuring that traffic continues to flow on the network link.|$|R

40|$|Post-translational {{modifications}} of Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) {{play a key}} role in regulating the bypass of DNA lesions during DNA replication. PCNA can be monoubiquitylated at lysine 164 by the RAD 6 -RAD 18 ubiquitin ligase complex. Through this modification, PCNA can interact with low fidelity Y family DNA polymerases to promote translesion synthesis. Monoubiquitylated PCNA can be polyubiquitylated on lysine 63 of ubiquitin by a further ubiquitin-conjugating complex. This modification promotes a template <b>switching</b> <b>bypass</b> process in yeast, while its role in higher eukaryotes is less clear. We investigated the function of PCNA ubiquitylation using a PCNA(K 164 R) mutant DT 40 chicken B lymphoblastoma cell line, which is hypersensitive to DNA damaging agents such as methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), cisplatin or ultraviolet radiation (UV) due to the loss of PCNA modifications. In the PCNA(K 164 R) mutant we also detected cell cycle arrest following UV treatment, a reduced rate of damage bypass through translesion DNA synthesis on synthetic UV photoproducts, and an increased rate of genomic mutagenesis following MMS treatment. PCNA-ubiquitin fusion proteins have been reported to mimic endogenous PCNA ubiquitylation. We found that the stable expression of a PCNA(K 164 R) -ubiquitin fusion protein fully or partially rescued the observed defects of the PCNA(K 164 R) mutant. The expression of a PCNA(K 164 R) -ubiquitin(K 63 R) fusion protein, on which the formation of lysine 63 -linked polyubiquitin chains is not possible, similarly rescued the cell cycle arrest, DNA damage sensitivity, reduction of translesion synthesis and increase of MMS-induced genomic mutagenesis. Template <b>switching</b> <b>bypass</b> was not affected by the genetic elimination of PCNA polyubiquitylation, but it was reduced in the absence of the recombination proteins BRCA 1 or XRCC 3. Our study found no requirement for PCNA polyubiquitylation to protect cells from replication-stalling DNA damage...|$|R

5000|$|Gibson started {{producing}} the S-1 in mid-1974, but released {{it on the}} market in 1975. Its production lifespan was 1974-1980. Like the Gibson Marauder, the S-1 was an attempt to break through into the single-coil guitar market. It too consisted of a flat Les Paul -like body with a maple Flying V neck bolted on. Unlike the Marauder, however, the S-1 featured three [...] "see-thru" [...] single-coil pickups designed by Bill Lawrence, with fairly elaborate circuitry to generate humbucking and single-coil pick-up sounds. Just like the Marauders, the S-1 all had Schaller made [...] "Harmonica" [...] ("tune-o-matic" [...] style) bridges and the standard Gibson stopbar tailpiece. The S-1 had one 2 way toggle switch and a [...] "chicken head" [...] 4 position rotary switch. This 4 way rotary switch made it possible to use the pick-ups in 4 different ways: 1) neck + middle, 2), middle pick-up + bridge pick-up, 3) all three together, and 4) the neck and bridge out of phase. In the down position the 2 way toggle <b>switch</b> <b>bypassed</b> the entire 4 position rotary switch circuit and made one straight connection to the bridge pick-up, which resulted in a sound that was pretty close to that of the Fender Esquire (Telecaster in bridge only position). The potentiometers are volume and tone. The sound was similar to that of a Fender Stratocaster or a Fender Telecaster.|$|R
