The initial QDAP board is notable for introducing speech recognition into the public telephone network to automate the handling of operator assisted telephone calls.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In August 2013, the Tor network {{experienced}} a sudden, dras-tic reduction in performance {{due to the}} Mevade/Sefnit botnet. This bot-net ran its command and control server as a Tor hidden service, so that all infected nodes contacted the command and control through Tor. In this paper, we consider several protocol changes to protect Tor against future incidents of this nature, describing the research challenges that must be solved in order to evaluate and deploy each of these methods. In particular, we consider four technical approaches: resource-based throt-tling, guard node throttling, reuse of failed partial circuits, and hidden <b>service</b> <b>circuit</b> isolation. ...|$|E

40|$|Circuit {{breakers}} (CBs) {{are very}} important elements in the power system. They are used to switch other equipment {{in and out of}} <b>service.</b> <b>Circuit</b> breakers need to be reliable since their incorrect operation can cause major issues with power system protection and control. Today’s practice in monitoring circuit breaker operation and status in real time is reduced to the use of Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system to assess CB status. More detailed information about the control circuit performance may be obtained by CB test equipment typically used for maintenance diagnostics [1]. This paper addresses two important issues: a) how improved CB monitoring may be implemented in real-time, and b) what would be the benefits of such an implementation. The results reported in this paper are coming from two research projects, conducted using funding from CenterPoint Energy and DOE-CERTS aimed at development of software for automated analysis of CB data and the othe...|$|E

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the efficiency of}} different functional structures, reorganization patterns and alternative allocation of eventual new resources in a hospital emergency department.

The network containing the intermediate <b>service</b> <b>circuit</b> of the patients, from their arrival to their leaving, was modelled through nine interconnected queue systems. Actual operations as well as eight different alternative scenarios were simulated and compared. Changes in human resources, arrival rates and service times of auxiliary diagnostics equipment were simulated. We conclude that the medical classifying service should not be potentiated {{at the expense of}} the second level (general emergency doctors). Monitoring arrival times is also suggested. Collapses and saturation levels would occur if the arrival time were 12 patients per hour, being now almost 11 at some fixed times of the day.

40|$|An {{expanding}} wireless industry {{creates a}} demand for smaller and smarter devices, while maintaining the high performance requirements. Todays solutions often use off-chip components to meet these demands, which lead to additional area, cost and parasitic components. RF MEMS can beneficially replace {{a great number of}} these components, and in integration with CMOS offer small devices at low cost with on-chip signal processing. One important component in RF systems is the variable capacitor, or varactor. This thesis presents two varactor designs made using a CMOS-MEMS process that enable monolithic integration of MEMS and CMOS. The varactors are electrothermal actuated and based on interdigitated combs moving lateral, parallel to the substrate. A latch mechanism is used so that the varactors only require power when switching. Since the fabricated circuit did not arrive in time for measurements only calculated and simulated results are presented. Bimetal actuator theory is used for theoretical understanding of the actuator and the various design parameters are thoroughly analyzed and discussed. The capacitances of the varactors is in the range of 133 - 897 fF, with tuning ranges of 440 % and 489 % and Q-factors of ~ 30 at 2 GHz. In addition an experimental lateral DC series switch has been made. The purpose of this switch is to investigate how well defined the sidewalls of this CMOS-MEMS process are to determine if it is possible to obtain a good metal-to-metal connection. This work will be important for future work on CMOS-MEMS switches. All simulations have been done using Coventorware, while the layout of the chip has been made in Cadence.
