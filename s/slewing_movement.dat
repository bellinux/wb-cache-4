40|$|Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are {{the most}} violent explosions in the Universe, {{releasing}} {{a huge amount of}} energy in few seconds. While our understanding of the prompt and the afterglow phases has increased with Swift and Fermi, we have very few information about their High Energy (HE, E ≲ 100) emission components. This requires a ground-based experiment able to perform fast follow-up with enough sensitivity above ~ 50 GeV. The MAGIC (Major Atmospheric Gamma-ray Imaging Cherenkov) telescopes have been designed to perform fast follow-up on GRBs thanks to fast <b>slewing</b> <b>movement</b> and low energy threshold (~ 50 GeV). Since the beginning of the operations, MAGIC followed-up 89 GRBs in good observational conditions. In this contribution the MAGIC GRBs follow-up campaign and the results which could be obtained by detecting HE and Very High Energy (VHE, E ≳ 100 GeV) γ-rays from GRBs will be reviewed...|$|E
40|$|The {{technique}} of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) allows {{the estimation of}} all five Earth Orientation Parameters (EOP), the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) {{and it is a}} primary contributor to the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF), in particular with information about its scale. The International VLBI Service for Geodesy and Astrometry (IVS) aims at an improvement of accuracies for the next generation VLBI system by one order of magnitude, as compared to today’s level. This concerns the accuracies of the station positions and velocities that should be achieved at the 1 mm and 0. 1 mm/year level, respectively, within the next years. Therefore a concept has been developed which was called VLBI 2010 and then VLBI Global Observing System (VGOS). To reach these ambitious aims new VLBI Twin Telescopes (TT) are built next to already existing radio telescopes. The smaller TT, which are faster in their <b>slewing</b> <b>movement,</b> shall contribute to the goals of VGOS by an increasing number of scans and observations per site at a time. This study covers the utilisation of TT and goes into more detail about suchlike stations at the sites of Onsala in Sweden and Wettzell in Germany, which are in the works and are already built respectively. Therefore a global VLBI campaign named CONT 11, which was held in September 2011, is rescheduled and simulated to compare the results between the subjoined TT and all other thirteen participating stations from this network of telescopes. As expected the distribution and absolute number of scans and observations in conjunction with these TT surpass the other antennas. Also the differences between simulated and estimated zenith delays are smaller for TT. However, baseline length repeatabilities derived from Monte Carlo simulations do not yield improved values for TT for the scheduling strategies tested in this thesis. Consequently more research for scheduling Twin Telescopes is required...|$|E
40|$|Loading of bulk {{materials}} like iron ore, coal, fertilizers, grains into ships for transportation by sea {{is done by}} ship loaders. Ship loaders are a very common sight in ports and jetties from where {{bulk materials}} are exported. It mainly consists of an extendable boom, a belt conveyor and a mobile structure to support the boom. It is usually mounted on rails and sometimes on tires and can move {{in order to be}} able to reach the whole length of the ship. The boom also can move front and back (boom telescoping), up and down (luffing) by separate drives so that it can fill all the corners of the ship hatches. Ship loaders are built in capacities from 1000 to 15000 TPH (tones per hour). The height of a ship loader can be in excess of 20 meters and the boom can extend to a length of more than 60 meters. Arc type of ship loaders are usually mounted on a pair of rails that are parallel to the berth and the ship. This type of ship loader can perform operations like long travel, luffing and <b>slewing</b> <b>movement</b> of the boom to reach maximum portions the ship hatch area. This type of ship loaders are less common in present day ports as it cannot load material to all portions of the ship hatches, requires huge berth construction work and more number of conveyors A Linear ship loader is usually mounted on a pair of rails that are parallel to the berth and the ship. This type of ship loader can perform operations like long travel, luffing and telescopic movement of the boom to reach all portions of the ship hatch. We propose a machine called radial ship loader which is capable of loading 1000 ’s of tons of bulk material in to ships and can considerably reduce civil work for berth, power consumption and number of conveyors required for operatio...|$|E
