This paper reports the analysis of five hours of video recording. During two <b>sub-sessions</b> within an experimental session, the “human mother” pointed the objects to the monkey, sequentially, either with a vocal designation or not. The results show that the monkey tends to contact more objects and manipulates them more when they have been previously designated by the “mother. ” This suggests a form of social facilitation.

40|$|Abstract—An {{external}} {{web service}} may evolve without prior notification. In {{the course of}} the regression testing of a workflow-based web service, existing test case prioritization techniques may only verify the latest service composition using the not-yet-executed test cases, overlooking high-priority test cases that have already been applied to the service composition before the evolution. In this paper, we propose Preemptive Regression Testing (PRT), an adaptive testing approach to addressing this challenge. Whenever a change in the coverage of any service artifact is detected, PRT recursively preempts the current session of regression test and creates a <b>sub-session</b> of the current test session to assure such lately identified changes in coverage by adjusting the execution priority of the test cases in the test suite. Then, the <b>sub-session</b> will resume the execution from the suspended position. PRT terminates only when each test case in the test suite has been executed at least once without any preemption activated in between any test case executions. The experimental result confirms that testing workflow-based web service {{in the face of such}} changes is very challenging; and one of the PRT-enriched techniques shows its potential to overcome the challenge.

In the meantime other products were included into the product palette: rapid orbits, predicted orbits, GPS satellite clock information, station coordi-nates and velocities (SINEX), and station-specific tropospheric zenith delays. For long time the IGS community {{is well aware of}} the fact that the world-wide IGS network offers a unique opportunity to extract ionospheric information on a global scale. At the IGS workshop held in Silver Spring in March 1996, a first <b>sub-session</b> was dedicated to the ionosphere. Main subject of this ionosphere <b>sub-session</b> was an intercomparison of ionosphere products provided by several Analysis Centers in order to get an idea of the accuracies that can be achieved. In addition it was identified for the first time, which Analysis Centers indicated their willingness to contribute to an IGS ionosphere product. Since 1996 considerable progress in ionosphere modeling has been achieved at the different Analysis Centers, and today most of them are able, or in a position very close to be able, to provide ionosphere information on a routine basis. An official format for the exchange of ionosphere maps, called IONEX, has been worked out and approved. It will be the main task of the 1998 IGS Workshop to prepare the start of a coordinated routine processing and combination of future IGS ionosphere prod-ucts. ...|$|E
40|$|Efficient {{multicast}} {{congestion control}} (MCC) {{is one of}} the critical components required to enable the IP multicast deployment over the Internet. Previously proposed MCC schemes can be categorized in two: single-rate or multi-rate. Single-rate schemes make all recipients get data at a common rate allowed by the slowest receiver, but are relatively simple. Multi-rate schemes allow heterogeneous receiving rates and thus provides better scalability, but relies heavily on router state update. A recent work [1] combined these two methods and provided a multi-rate scheme by means of single-rate schemes with relatively low complexity. In this paper, we propose a new scheme called Generalized Multicast Congestion Control (GMCC). GMCC provides multi-rate features at low complexity by using a set of independent single-rate <b>sub-sessions</b> (a. k. a layers) as building blocks. The scheme is named GMCC because single-rate MCC is just one of its special cases. Unlike the earlier work [1], GMCC does not have the drawback of static configuration of the source which may not match with the dynamic network situations. GMCC i...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} for interaction control in large, synchronous and loosely coupled but chairperson-controlled conferences. Based on the IP-Multicast protocol which is extended by mechanisms allowing resource reservation for prioritized flows, the proposed architecture supports interaction control among conference members as well as focus control of each conference participant. Interaction control is performed by using a scalable signaling protocol: a conference may be recursively split into <b>sub-sessions</b> each of which provides an identical functionality independently of the others and establishes a singular session. A session is controlled by a chairperson who manually grants, revokes or rejects an interaction request of a registered session member. The granted interaction is announced to the session participants such that all participants may have their focus automatically set to the audio and video streams providing session participant. The such provided focus control enables conference participants to individually manage their own audio and video stream perception, i. e. a participant either decides individually to whom the personal attention should be granted or follows strictly the session's focus granted by the chairperson. The proposed conference control architecture provides the network-management platform to large virtual classrooms for university-like lectures over high-speed Internetconnections. While focusing {{the application of the}} conference control architecture to universitylike lectures, it remains generally applicable for any audio- and video-supported chairperson-controlled conference over the Internet. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{session on}} {{alternative}} fuels and vehicles, including technical but also non-technical {{aspects of their}} promotion (local initiative, public awareness) offered an instructive and broad picture, regarding the possibilities of more sustainable alternative fuels/powertain introduction. The <b>sub-session</b> dedicated to hydrogen demonstrated and recorded how the commission already committed themselves for research programmes funding, but also how strong are the barriers to overpass, before large hydrogen public applications in transport. Regarding alternative fuels, the most discussed pathways have been presented: methane and bio-methane, synthetic fuels from biomass (BTL), from natural gas (GTL) or coal (CTL), biodiesels, bio-ethanols. All these fuels have been assessed on their current availability and potential for future developments, also on a well-to-wheels basis, including detailed accounting of the GHG emitted during the fuels manufacturing, and not only during the final use in the vehicle. Connected to this last point, an important challenge emerged during all the sessions: the problematic of alternative fuels certification. To end, the session on the technologies offered interesting developments regarding the flexfuel vehicles experience in Brazil, but also discussions around {{the relevance of the}} NEDC test cycle of advanced and alternative vehicles type approval.

40|$|Abstract- A {{important}} {{phase in}} any web personalization system is transaction identification. Recently {{a number of}} researches have been done to incorporate semantics of a web site in representation of transactions. Building a hierarchy of concepts manually is time consuming and expensive. In this paper we intend to address these shortcomings. Our contribution is that we introduce a mechanism to automatically improve {{the representation of the}} user in the website using a comprehensive lexical semantic resource and semantic clusters. We utilize Wikipedia, the largest encyclopedia to date, as a rich lexical resource to enhance the automatic construction of vector model representation of user sessions. We cluster web pages based on their content with Hierarchical Unsupervised Fuzzy Clustering algorithms, are effective methods, for exploring the structure of complex real data where grouping of overlapping and vague elements is necessary. Entries in web server logs are used to identify users and visit sessions, while web page or resources in the site are clustered based on their content and their semantic. Theses clusters of web documents are used to scrutinize the discovered web sessions in order to identify what we call subsessions. Each <b>sub-session</b> have consistent goal. This process engendered to improving deriving semantic sessions from web site user page views. Our experiments show that proposed system significantly improves the quality of web personalization process...|$|E
40|$|Characterizing {{peer-to-peer}} overlays {{is crucial}} for understanding their impact on service provider networks and assessing their performance. Most popular file exchange applications use distributed hash tables (DHTs) {{as a framework for}} managing information. Their fully decentralized nature makes monitoring and users tracking challenging. In this work, we analyze KAD, a widely deployed DHT system. Thanks to the unique possibility to monitor a large population of about 20, 000 ADSL clients {{at the edge of the}} network, we are able to characterize the content downloaded and shared by local users. We devised a passive content monitoring toolkit to reliably track users between sessions despite dynamic IP allocation. We applied our tool over one month of data. Our main findings are: (i) Over half a TB of fresh data is downloaded every day by the users we monitor, (ii) A significant fraction of peers (20 %) regulary change their ID in the KAD overlay, either on a session basis or on a <b>sub-session</b> basis, which can be detrimental to the proper functioning of the DHT, (iii) Those users, that we term Chameleon users, are connected longer than regular users, and they (claim to) have less data in their shared folder than regular peers and (iv) As a consequence, even a non biased observation of the users shared folder can only provide a lower bound of the content downloaded and shared by a population of ADSL users...|$|E
40|$|Graphical-user {{interface}} (GUI) -based {{software applications}} {{are with the}} job of verifying that these tasks can be performed using the software; and that the software does not “behave badly”. A set of use cases with high-level descriptions is also given to the testers. The tester executes these high-level steps by using GUI widgets on which events can be performed. GUI testers are both automated and manual working with undetermined input spaces. The testers unknowingly miss the event sequences navigated by the GUI, and fail to realize its implementation which may allow the execution of some disallowed sequences. This thesis proposes Preemptive Regression Testing (PRT) an adaptive taxing move to address this challenge. Whenever {{a change in the}} exposure of any service artifact is detected, PRT recursively preempts the current setting of regression test and creates a <b>sub-session</b> of the current test session to assure lately identified changes in coverage by adjusting the precedence of the test cases in the test suite. Then, the execution will resume the sub session from the balanced location of the test cases. PRT terminates only when each test case in the test suite has been executed at least once without any preemption activated in between any test case executions. The new result confirms that testing water flow method based web service in the phase of such changes is very difficult and one of the PRT-enriched techniques will overcome the challenge...|$|E
40|$|Method: The Biographic Narrative Interpretive Method (Prue CHAMBERLAYNE, Joanna BORNAT & Tom WENGRAF, 2000; Tom WENGRAF 2001; Gabriele ROSENTHAL 2004; Kip JONES 2004) uses an {{interview}} technique {{in the form}} of a single, initial narrative-inducing question (minimalist-passive), for example, "Tell me the story of your life," to elicit an extensive, uninterrupted narration. This shift encompasses willingness on the part of the researcher to cede "control" of the interview scene to the interviewee and assume the posture of active listener/audience participant. A follow-up <b>sub-session</b> can then be used to ask additional questions, but based only on what the interviewee has said in the first interview and using her/his words and phrases in the same order. Through hypothesising how the lived life informs the told story, the case history is then finally constructed from the two separate threads of the "lived life" and the "told story. " In this paper, the "lived life" and "told story" are presented in a "raw" form with the further involvement of the reader in mind. The story has not been "analysed" by the interviewer, but left open and transparent. Still, the production of the story becomes the creative output and social construction of both the storyteller and the interviewer (the performer and the audience) and, in this case particularly, one story of many stories that could have been told by the person interviewed. Routine facts are often back-grounded by the narrator through the use of this method in favour of spontaneity in the storytelling and the creation of meaningful life metaphors. In this way, the personal journey to "who the interviewee is today" is described, rather than merely a list of accomplishments. The Lived Life: Mary GERGEN (née McCANNEY) was born in 1938. The first part of her childhood was spent in the small town of Balaton, Minnesota. She subsequently moved with her family to Minneapolis when she was 12. She attended a suburban middle-class high school where she was popular. She went on to the University of Minnesota after graduating high school and continued to be both a gifted student, well-liked and social. In her final year she met an architecture student and married him shortly after graduation. The couple had a girl, Lisa, and a boy, Michael. Over the next seven years, Mary studied part-time for a Master's Degree in Counselling Psychology. Her husband was a fast track architect and they expected to move to Rome in the early 60 s, but moved instead to Boston where he could continue his studies at MIT. At a Halloween party given at Harvard, Mary met Ken GERGEN for the first time. They had a long conversation and she discovered that he had an opening for a research assistant, a position for which she immediately applied. She got the job and Ken encouraged her to finish her Master's Degree. She worked for him for two years; he later accepted a position at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania, leaving Harvard (and Mary) behind. Both of their marriages began to end. Ken received a fellowship to study in Rome and Mary and her two children left with him on a ship to Rome in 1968. They were married in October of 1969. Back at Swarthmore, they began to work together on experimental projects, antiwar protests, etc. Ken and Mary lived and worked in Japan in 1972 - 73. By the mid- 70 s, Mary realised that she wanted a PhD and became a graduate student at Temple University in Philadelphia in 1974 where she quickly became involved in teaching. In 1976 - 77 the couple spent a year in Paris. After receiving her PhD, Mary worked for a time at ATT doing longitudinal studies on managers' lives. Eventually, she got a teaching job at the Pennsylvania State University local campus, fifteen minutes drive from their house, where she went through the ranks from assistant professor to associate professor to full Professor of Psychology and of Women's Studies. In 1988 - 89 Ken and Mary went to Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study, but Ken spent most of the year at Heidelberg in Germany, leaving Mary on her own in the Netherlands. She and Ken persist in teaching and are involved in the Taos Institute promoting social constructionist ideas, as well as co-editing The Positive Aging Newsletter. Mary continues to travel, teach, write and give papers and workshops. Recent publications include Social Construction: A Reader with Ken GERGEN and Feminist Reconstructions in Psychology Narrative, Gender, and Performance. URN: urn:nbn:de: 0114 -fqs 040318...|$|E
