5|$|DNK {{carried out}} tests {{with the system}} in 2010 for firefighters using <b>self-contained</b> <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatus</b> in {{structure}} fires, and found the system to be sufficient. Similar test were carried out by Oslo Fire Department later that year, and {{they found that the}} radio system was insufficient for their needs. Oslo Fire Department concluded that the DNK tests were only successful because of the use of additional directional gateway/repeater-radio equipment. Because of this firefighters in Oslo continued to use the old ultra-high frequency radios during indoor fires. Both the Norwegian Police Security Service's bodyguard service and the service for protection of the royal family have opted to not use the new radio system, citing poor coverage indoors and while lying on the ground, even in downtown Oslo. The services have stated that this does not allow for interoperability with other agencies, which is a drawback in case of major incidents. Also the joint rescue coordination centers, the Norwegian Air Ambulance and the 330 Squadron which operates Westland Sea King search and rescue helicopters have opted out of using the system because of poor coverage. During the 2011 Norway attacks at Ut√∏ya, located in northern Buskerud, police officers from surrounding police districts were not able to communicate with local police because the area did not have coverage for the TETRA system.|$|E

25|$|To allow {{protection}} from the inherent risks of fighting fires, firefighters wear and carry protective and self-rescue equipment at all times. A <b>self-contained</b> <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatus</b> (SCBA) delivers air to the firefighter through a full face mask and is worn to protect against smoke inhalation, toxic fumes, and super heated gases. A special device called a Personal Alert Safety System (PASS) is commonly worn independently or {{as a part of}} the SCBA to alert others when a firefighter stops moving for a specified period of time or manually operates the device. The PASS device sounds an alarm that can assist another firefighter (firefighter assist and search team (FAST), or rapid intervention team (RIT), in locating the firefighter in distress.|$|E

2500|$|The {{standard}} {{fire engine}} is an apparatus designed primarily for firefighting operations. The {{primary purpose of the}} engine is transporting firefighters to the scene, providing a limited supply of water with which to fight the fire, and carrying [...] tools, equipment, and hoses needed by the firefighters. The tools carried on the fire engine will vary greatly based on many factors including the size of the department and what sort of terrain the department must handle. For example, departments located near large bodies of water or rivers are likely {{to have some sort of}} water rescue equipment. Standard tools found on nearly all fire engines include ladders, hydraulic rescue tools (often referred to as the jaws of life), floodlights, fire hose, fire extinguishers, <b>self-contained</b> <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatus,</b> and thermal imaging cameras.|$|E
2500|$|... (1979) Efficiency of self {{contained}} breathing apparatus (SCBA) MSA {{has been studied}} when they were used by firefighters. This SCBA had had air supply into the mask with [...] "on demand" [...] mode (with negative pressure under the mask during inhalation). Evaluation {{of the effectiveness of}} the respirator was conducted by determining the content of carboxyhemoglobin in the blood immediately after the cessation of fire extinguishing. Carboxyhemoglobin formed due to inhalation of carbon monoxide. The biomonitoring results shown: (1) the intermittently usage of these respirators makes it totally ineffective; (2) even in continuous usage of such breathing apparatus does not provide effective protection. The results of this study (and other similar studies) led to restrict the use of respirators with fresh air supply [...] "on demand"; and to prohibit their use in fighting fires. US and EU legislation obliges to use only <b>self-contained</b> <b>breathing</b> <b>apparatus</b> with [...] "pressure-demand" [...] mode of air supply (it provide positive pressure under the mask during inhalation) in extinguishing fires.|$|E
