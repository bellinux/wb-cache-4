Both compact <b>radio</b> <b>sources</b> appear to have symmetric jets of approximately the same luminosity, much lower than typically noted in compact double GPS sources. Similarities between PKS 2254 - 367 and NGC 1052, and differences with respect to other GPS galaxies, lead us to speculate that a sub-class of GPS <b>radio</b> <b>sources,</b> with low luminosity and with jet-dominated morphologies, exists and would be largely absent from <b>radio</b> <b>source</b> surveys with ~ 1 Jy flux density cutoffs.
