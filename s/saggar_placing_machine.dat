30|$|As {{mentioned}} above, at {{the beginning}} of 2000 s, Single Head architectural technology was adapted for use in the Pick and <b>Place</b> <b>machine.</b> Single Head is the general acceptance of particular product architecture and is characteristic of technical evolution in a Pick and <b>Place</b> <b>machines.</b> Single Head architectural technology actually dominated the Pick and <b>Place</b> <b>machine</b> market. A dominant design often emerges in response to the opportunity to obtain economies of scale or to take advantage of externalities (Arthur, 1988). The K as a front runner of OSAT, adapted it in spite of having plenty of its own technologies because customers such as Samsung has strongly required it. Figure 1 presents the operation principle of Single Head Pick and Place Module. By utilizing the single head, Pick and <b>Place</b> <b>machines</b> pick the die from on wafer and placing them in the holes. Single Head technology is principle operation method, thus architecture technology. The K having accumulated knowledge about the operation principle of the Pick and <b>Place</b> <b>machine</b> began the innovation, because single Head component had a time lag during the process from picking the die to placing it the hole. Also the time required to move the die hindered quality control. Real time product inspection is much more important for OSATs.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing EngineeringTraditionally GT {{problems}} {{focus on}} the grouping aspects and fail to integrate material handling part in facility layout design. It is necessary to consider the flow between machines while forming machine cells and evaluate grouping based on flow and operational load factors. But after forming cells, machines have to be placed inside a layout to minimize the material handling distance. There are not many approaches which consider the actual volume flow between machines while grouping and the related handling distances while <b>placing</b> <b>machine</b> cells. Typical GT based cell formation problems stop after grouping cells and {{evaluating the quality of}} the grouped cells. This thesis develops a comprehensive cell formation model, which integrates the GT philosophy with a facility layout problem using From-between flow matrix as a tool. This approach forms machine cells using a Non-Linear Integer Programming (NLIP) optimization model, assigns parts to cells using a new heuristic algorithm, evaluates cell grouping using a novel grouping efficiency measure and <b>places</b> <b>machine</b> cells in a layout space using a GA approach. Known case studies from literature are selected and tested using the developed procedure. Results obtained show a reduction in the intercell flow, high grouping efficiency and minimal material handling costs after machine placement when compared with the existing models...|$|R

30|$|Therefore, the {{question}} arises as to whether periodontally compromised patients might benefit from <b>placing</b> <b>machined</b> implants, {{in spite of their}} relatively higher early failure rate [35]. Thus, the aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the effect of different implant surface roughness on implant survival rate, mean marginal bone loss, and the incidence of peri-implantitis in periodontally compromised patients. For this reason, the present review addresses the following PICO (patient-intervention-comparison-outcomes) question: Is there a difference for implant survival, mean marginal bone loss, and the incidence of bleeding on probing (O) in periodontally compromised patients (P) receiving a machined dental implant (I) or rough surface dental implant (C)? Preferably, this question is answered in randomized controlled trials.|$|R

This enables us to probabilistically reason about and to identify the number of modes, the partition of the regressor space, and the linear dynamics of each local model from data. By appropriate choices of base measure and likelihood function, we give explicit expressions for how to perform both inference and prediction. Simulations and experiments on real data from a pick and <b>place</b> <b>machine</b> are used to illustrate the capabilities of the new approach...|$|R

This paper presents a methodology to build such a model combining a multibody environment, such as LMS Virtual. Lab Motion, and a controller design environment, such as Matlab/Simulink. Flexible subsystem which their dy-namics depend on the configuration can be modeled as a parameter-dependent model, extracted by the inter-polation of reduced models derived from finite element models, which can be run by Matlab/Simulink.
