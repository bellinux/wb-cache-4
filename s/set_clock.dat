50|$|In the {{succeeding}} {{years after the}} demise of the NetBurst microarchitecure and its 3+ GHz CPUs, microprocessor clock speeds kept slowly increasing after initially dropping by about 1 GHz. Several years' advances in manufacturing processes and power management (specifically, the ability to <b>set</b> <b>clock</b> speeds on a per-core basis) allowed for clock speeds as high or higher than the old NetBurst Pentium 4s and Pentium Ds but with much higher efficiency and performance. Current (2013) Intel microprocessors clock as high as Xeon E3-1290v2 4.1 GHz and 4.4 GHz (Core i7 4790K, i7 7700K). AMD crossed the 4 GHz barrier in 2011 with the debut of the initial Bulldozer based AMD FX CPUs and in June 2013 released the FX-9590 which can reach speeds of up to 5.0 GHz. However, similar issues with power usage and heat output have returned.|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe {{speed of}} {{circadian}} clocks in animals is tightly linked to complex phosphorylation programs that drive daily cycles in {{the levels of}} PERIOD (PER) proteins. Using Drosophila, we identify a time-delay circuit based on hierarchical phosphorylation that controls the daily downswing in PER abundance. Phosphorylation by the NEMO/NLK kinase at the “per-short” domain on PER stimulates phosphorylation by DOUBLETIME (DBT/CK 1 δ/ɛ) at several nearby sites. This multisite phosphorylation operates in a spatially oriented and graded manner to delay progressive phosphorylation by DBT at other more distal sites on PER, including those required for recognition by the F box protein SLIMB/β-TrCP and proteasomal degradation. Highly phosphorylated PER has a more open structure, suggesting that progressive increases in global phosphorylation contribute to the timing mechanism by slowly increasing PER susceptibility to degradation. Our findings identify NEMO as a clock kinase and demonstrate that long-range interactions between functionally distinct phospho-clusters collaborate to <b>set</b> <b>clock</b> speed...|$|E

40|$|A {{computer}} program recognizes selected patterns in time-series data like digitized samples of seismic or electrophysiological signals. The program implements an {{artificial neural network}} (ANN) and a <b>set</b> of N <b>clocks</b> {{for the purpose of}} determining whether N or more instances of a certain waveform, W, occur within a given time interval, T. The ANN must be trained to recognize W in the incoming stream of data. The first time the ANN recognizes W, it <b>sets</b> <b>clock</b> 1 to count down from T to zero; the second time it recognizes W, it <b>sets</b> <b>clock</b> 2 to count down from T to zero, and so forth through the Nth instance. On the N + 1 st instance, the cycle is repeated, starting with clock 1. If any clock has not reached zero when it is reset, then N instances of W have been detected within time T, and the program so indicates. The program can readily be encoded in a field-programmable gate array or an application-specific integrated circuit that could be used, for example, to detect electroencephalographic or electrocardiographic waveforms indicative of epileptic seizures or heart attacks, respectively...|$|R
