25|$|All SingStar games (except the {{original}} SingStar and Singalong with Disney for PlayStation 2) allow players to <b>swap</b> <b>out</b> the current disc (called the master disc) for another SingStar disc. This allows {{access to the}} songs on other versions without the need to reset the console; it also allows PS2 SingStar discs to be played on a PS3, regardless of its PS2 backwards compatibility status, by starting with a PS3 master disc. When a new disc is swapped in, the game retains the functionality and appearance of the master disc. By starting with a new version, players can swap in their old SingStar disc and experience them with the functionality and cosmetics of the master disc.|$|E
25|$|All {{life forms}} require certain core {{chemical}} elements needed for biochemical functioning. These include carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur—the elemental macronutrients for all organisms—often {{represented by the}} acronym CHNOPS. Together these make up nucleic acids, proteins and lipids, the bulk of living matter. Five of these six elements comprise the chemical components of DNA, the exception being sulfur. The latter is {{a component of the}} amino acids cysteine and methionine. The most biologically abundant of these elements is carbon, which has the desirable attribute of forming multiple, stable covalent bonds. This allows carbon-based (organic) molecules to form an immense variety of chemical arrangements. Alternative hypothetical types of biochemistry have been proposed that eliminate {{one or more of these}} elements, <b>swap</b> <b>out</b> an element for one not on the list, or change required chiralities or other chemical properties.|$|E

25|$|The C64 uses a {{somewhat}} complicated memory banking scheme; the normal power-on default {{is to have}} the BASIC ROM mapped in at $A000 and the screen editor/kernal ROM at $E000. Memory underneath the system ROMs can be written to, but not read back without <b>swapping</b> <b>out</b> the ROMs. $1 contains a register with control bits for enabling/disabling the system ROMS as well as the I/O area at $D000. Most software <b>swaps</b> <b>out</b> the BASIC ROM, less often the kernal as the user must then provide his own code for I/O and interrupt handling. The $D000 page contains the I/O registers at power on, it can either be swapped with the character ROM (normally invisible to the CPU) or else simply the bare RAM underneath. If the I/O registers are <b>swapped</b> <b>out,</b> it is also necessary to disable interrupts via a SEI instruction. Theoretically, if all ROMs and the I/O area are <b>swapped</b> <b>out,</b> the entire 64k of system RAM is accessible to software aside from $0/$1 and the color RAM at $D800. If the kernel ROM is <b>swapped</b> <b>out,</b> BASIC will be removed with it and {{it is not possible to}} have BASIC active without the kernel.|$|R

25|$|All {{reactors}} breed some fuel this way, but today's solid fueled thermal reactors don't breed enough {{new fuel}} from the fertile {{to make up}} for the amount of fissile they consume. This is because today's reactors use the mined uranium-plutonium cycle in a moderated neutron spectrum. Such a fuel cycle, using slowed down neutrons, gives back less than 2 new neutrons from fissioning the bred plutonium. Since 1 neutron is required to sustain the fission reaction, this leaves a budget of less than 1 neutron per fission to breed new fuel. In addition, the materials in the core such as metals, moderators and fission products absorb some neutrons, leaving too few neutrons to breed enough fuel to continue operating the reactor. As a consequence they must add new fissile fuel periodically and <b>swap</b> <b>out</b> some of the old fuel to make room for the new fuel.|$|E
25|$|Groove recordings, first {{designed}} in the final quarter of the 19th century, held a predominant position for nearly a century—withstanding competition from reel-to-reel tape, the 8-track cartridge, and the compact cassette. In 1988, the compact disc surpassed the gramophone record in unit sales. Vinyl records experienced a sudden decline in popularity between 1988 and 1991, when the major label distributors restricted their return policies, which retailers had been relying on to maintain and <b>swap</b> <b>out</b> stocks of relatively unpopular titles. First the distributors began charging retailers more for new product if they returned unsold vinyl, and then they stopped providing any credit at all for returns. Retailers, fearing they would be stuck with anything they ordered, only ordered proven, popular titles that they knew would sell, and devoted more shelf space to CDs and cassettes. Record companies also deleted many vinyl titles from production and distribution, further undermining {{the availability of the}} format and leading to the closure of pressing plants. This rapid decline in the availability of records accelerated the format's decline in popularity, and is seen by some as a deliberate ploy to make consumers switch to CDs, which were more profitable for the record companies.|$|E
500|$|By early 1986, {{the planned}} launch date of October that year looked feasible, but the Challenger {{accident}} brought the U.S. space program to a halt, grounding the Space Shuttle fleet and forcing {{the launch of}} Hubble to be postponed for several years. The telescope had {{to be kept in}} a clean room, powered up and purged with nitrogen, until a launch could be rescheduled. This costly situation (about [...] per month) pushed the overall costs of the project even higher. This delay did allow time for engineers to perform extensive tests, <b>swap</b> <b>out</b> a possibly failure-prone battery, and make other improvements. Furthermore, the ground software needed to control Hubble was not ready in 1986, and in fact was barely ready by the 1990 launch.|$|E

500|$|Criticism of {{the game}} {{included}} complaints about the four-disc format {{of the game}}, which required players to <b>swap</b> <b>out</b> the installer disc {{with one of the}} other discs every time the player entered a new Age. GameSpot's Scott Osborne noted that due to the frame-by-frame nature of gameplay, it was occasionally difficult to discern where players were allowed to venture and what areas were unreachable. The Los Angeles Times reported that bugs including a lack of sound, incompatibility with certain graphics cards and system crashes were present in as many as 10 percent of the first shipment of discs. Reviewers who had not enjoyed Myst or Riven stated that there was nothing new or substantially different in the game to warrant interest; The New York Times observed, [...] "Exile has everything you loved or hated about Myst and Riven." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{engine for}} God of War III {{was from the}} first two installments. Santa Monica senior {{producer}} Steve Caterson said that the development team ported God of War IIs engine to the PlayStation 3 {{and were able to}} quickly play the game. Everything that Kratos could do in previous games, he could do on the PlayStation 3, which allowed the developers to immediately begin designing new content. As the game was being developed, the code department would <b>swap</b> <b>out</b> PlayStation 2 components with PlayStation 3 components. They replaced the renderer, the particle system, and the collision system. Feldman said that although they were re-using the engine from God of War II, the core engine for God of War III was brand new. Between the 2009 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) and the time the game shipped, morphological anti-aliasing (MLAA) was added, which graphics engineer Ben Diamand said [...] "improved edges dramatically and saved substantial amounts of frame-rate." [...] MLAA is [...] "now a popular edge-detection process that can cost-effectively remove jagged edges from each frame", which helped Santa Monica free up the processing cycle and [...] "allowed them to add to the spectacle in other ways." [...] Diamand also said that [...] "depth-of-field, motion blur, crepuscular 'god' rays and refraction were either added or improved in quality and speed" [...] during that same time period.|$|E
500|$|First-person {{shooters}} typically give players {{a choice}} of weapons, which have a large impact on how the player will approach the game. Some game designs have realistic models of actual existing or historical weapons, incorporating their rate of fire, magazine size, ammunition amount, recoil and accuracy. Other first-person shooter games may incorporate imaginative variations of weapons, including future prototypes, [...] "alien technology" [...] scenario defined weaponry, and/or utilizing {{a wide array of}} projectiles, from industrial labor tools to laser, energy, plasma, rocket and grenade launchers or crossbows. These many variations may also be applied to the tossing animations of [...] grenades, rocks, spears and the like. Also, more unconventional modes of destruction may be employed from the viewable users hands such as flames, electricity, telekinesis or other supernatural constructions. However, designers often allow characters to carry varying multiples of weapons with little to no reduction in speed or mobility, or perhaps more realistically, a pistol or smaller device and a long rifle or even limiting the player to only one weapon at a time. There are often options to trade up, upgrade or <b>swap</b> <b>out</b> in most games. Thus, the standards of realism varies between design elements. The protagonist can generally be healed and re-armed by means of items such as first aid kits, simply by walking over them. Some games allow players to accumulate experience points similar to those found in role-playing games, which can unlock new weapons and abilities.|$|E

2500|$|Sets during Band Tours may feature pre-determined song lists or song lists {{decided by}} the band similar to the main Sets mode, with {{available}} songs limited to certain criteria as overall band difficulty or genre type. Players may also be presented with the option to <b>swap</b> <b>out</b> a song for a crowd-requested one, or to also play an encore song {{in the same manner}} as with Sets. The band is not only rated on their general performance based on the five star rating, but as well as the players' stage presence impact the rewards from these gigs, which are based on how well the band performs in unison, such as hitting [...] "Overdrive" [...] together, drummers completing drum fills, and vocalists improvising.

A character can <b>swap</b> <b>out</b> their Seraph partners while not in this form. Both characters capable of Armatization can be in this form at the same time. If the human character is defeated on the field, activating Armatization will resurrect them if their current Seraph partner is still active.
