5|$|Whereas {{the common}} law {{protected}} habitation and <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>wealth</b> and food in a largely agricultural society, the Industrial Revolution, especially the Luddism resulting from workers' perceived threats to their livelihood, required new legislation to match the circumstances. The reaction of Parliament to Luddism was to criminalise machine-breaking – the destruction of textile-making machinery – as early as 1721. Initially the punishment was transportation to the Colonies {{but as a result}} of continued opposition to mechanisation the Frame-Breaking Act of 1812 made the death penalty available.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, Constantinople was {{undergoing}} expansion. The cosmopolitan {{character of the}} city was being reinforced by the arrival of Italian merchants and Crusaders en route to the Holy Land. The Venetians, the Genoese, and others opened up the ports of the Aegean to commerce, shipping goods from the Crusader kingdoms of Outremer and Fatimid Egypt to the west and trading with Byzantium via Constantinople. These maritime traders stimulated demand in the towns and cities of Greece, Macedonia, and the Greek Islands, generating new <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>wealth</b> in a predominantly agrarian economy. Thessaloniki, the second city of the Empire, hosted a famous summer fair that attracted traders from across the Balkans and even further afield to its bustling market stalls.

500|$|The high {{fertility}} of {{the land}} led the Norman kings to bring settlers from neighbouring regions or to resettle farmers to areas where cultivation of land was needed. This led to increase of agrarian production. The main <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>wealth</b> for the Kingdom of Sicily at that period were its maritime cities, most important of which were Naples and Amalfi, from which local products were exported. The main export was hard grain, with other products exported including nuts, timber, oil, bacon, cheese, skins, hides, hemp and cloth. Grain and other dry products were measured in salme, which was equivalent to 275.08litres {{in the western part}} of the Kingdom, and 3.3litres in the eastern part. The salma was divided in 16tumoli. One tumolo was equivalent to 17,193litres. Weight was measured in cantari. One cantaro was equivalent to [...] and was divided in one hundred rottoli. Cloth was measured in canne. One canna was 2.06meters long. By the end of the 12th century Messina had become one of the leading commercial cities of the kingdom.|$|E
500|$|The Fasci {{were the}} result of the revolt of the Sicilian peasants against the {{introduction}} of capitalist relationships into the rural economy aggravated by the world depression in agriculture of the 1880s. [...] The agrarian crisis between 1888 and 1892 led to a steep decrease in wheat prices. The island’s main <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>wealth</b> – wine, fruit and sulphur – suffered a heavy blow. The dominant landowning class channeled most of the economic burden on to the peasantry, in the form of higher rents and discriminatory local taxation. As social tension rose, a handful of young and hitherto quite unknown socialist intellectuals – many of them recent graduates of Palermo University – seized their opportunity. The movement grew under the first government of Prime minister Francesco Crispi (1887-1891) and coincided with unpopular tax increases and ratification of a series of laws curtailing personal freedom. The Italian economy had been sliding into a deep recession since the late 1880s. New protective tariffs had been introduced in 1887 on agricultural and industrial goods, followed by a trade war with France, which badly damaged Italian commerce and affecting Italy’s agricultural exports, the only potentially dynamic economic sector of southern Italy. Many farmers suffered severely.|$|E

2500|$|How {{quickly the}} towers were built is controversial. Poyntz Wright {{estimates}} {{one or two}} years. John H.

Nikolaus Pevsner notes {{that at the end of}} the 14th century, Somerset was producing a quarter of the wool products made in England and this was one of the <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>wealth</b> that produced the Somerset towers. The boom in wool led to a comparable, though architecturally rather different, wave of equally extravagant parish churches in 15th century Suffolk. An additional source of support for some of the Somerset churches would have been close ties to nearby monasteries in Muchelney, Athelney, Glastonbury and Bath.|$|E
2500|$|No new {{consensus}} {{has emerged}} {{to replace the}} documentary hypothesis, but since roughly the mid-1980s an influential theory has emerged which relates {{the emergence of the}} Pentateuch to the situation in Judah in the 5th century BCE under Persian imperial rule. The central institution in the post-Exilic Persian province of Yehud (the Persian name for the former kingdom of Judah) was the reconstructed Second Temple, which functioned both as the administrative centre for the province and as the means through which Yehud paid taxes to the central government. The central government was willing to grant autonomy to local communities throughout the empire, but it was first necessary for the would-be autonomous community to present the local laws for imperial authorisation. This provided a powerful incentive for the various groups that constituted the Jewish community in Yehud to come to an agreement. The major groups were the landed families who controlled the main <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>wealth,</b> and the priestly families who controlled the Temple. Each group had its own history of origins that legitimated its prerogatives. The tradition of the landowners was based on the old Deuteronomistic tradition, which had existed since at least the 6th century BCE and had its roots even earlier; that of the priestly families was composed to [...] "correct" [...] and [...] "complete" [...] the landowners' composition. In the final document Genesis 1-11 lays the foundations, Genesis 12-50 defines the people of Israel, and the books of Moses define the community's laws and relationship to its God.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the final}} stage of the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs, Tenochtitlan was besieged and {{essentially}} razed. Hernán Cortés understood the strategic and symbolic importance of the Aztec capital and founded the Spanish capital of Mexico City on the site, and in particular rebuilt the Aztec ceremonial and political center as the main square, the Plaza Mayor, usually called the Zócalo. Some of the oldest structures in Mexico City date from the early conquest era. Many colonial-era buildings remain standing and have been re-purposed government buildings and museums. [...] As the seats of the Viceroyalty of New Spain and the Archbishopric of New Spain, Mexico City was the center of political and religious institutions, but it was also the center of Mexico's economic activity and the residence of social elites in colonial Mexico (1521–1821). [...] It was where the great merchant houses were located and the economic elites of the country lived, even if their <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>wealth</b> were elsewhere. The concentration of mansions and palaces in what is now the Mexico City historic center led it to be nicknamed, the [...] "City of Palaces", a sobriquet often attributed to great savant Alexander von Humboldt, perhaps in error. [...] It was also a major educational center, with the University of Mexico founded in 1553 as part of the complex of the Plaza Mayor. The crown-approved attempt to train Nahua men to become Christian priests saw the establishment in 1536 of the Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco in one of the two sections of the capital governed by a Nahua city council (cabildo). Many religious institutions for the education of the sons of Spanish elites were also based in the capital. Mexico City had the colony's largest concentration of those of Spanish heritage (both Iberian-born peninsulares and American-born criollos), as well as the largest concentration of mixed race casta population in the colony. Many Indians also lived outside the center of the capital.|$|E

Internationally, Rome used the [...] "invitation" [...] of the mercenaries that had captured Sardinia to occupy the island. The seizure of Sardinia and the outrageous extra indemnity fuelled resentment in Carthage. The loss of Sardinia, along with the earlier loss of Sicily meant that Carthage's traditional <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>wealth,</b> its trade, was now severely compromised, forcing them to look for a new <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>wealth.</b> This led Hamilcar, together with his son-in-law Hasdrubal and his son Hannibal to establish a power base in Hispania, outside Rome's sphere of influence, which later became the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>wealth</b> and manpower for Hannibal's initial campaigns in the Second Punic War.|$|R
