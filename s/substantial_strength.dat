60|$|It must be remembered, {{that since}} the Revolution, until the period we are {{speaking}} of, {{the influence of the}} Crown had been always employed in supporting the Ministers of State, and in carrying on the public business according to their opinions. But the party now in question is formed upon a very different idea. It is to intercept the favour, protection, and confidence of the Crown in the passage to its Ministers; it is to come between them and their importance in Parliament; it is to separate them from all their natural and acquired dependencies; it is intended as the control, not the support, of Administration. The machinery of this system is perplexed in its movements, and false in its principle. It is formed on a supposition that the King is something external to his government; and that he may be honoured and aggrandised, even by its debility and disgrace. The plan proceeds expressly on the idea of enfeebling the regular executory power. It proceeds on the idea of weakening the State in order to strengthen the Court. The scheme depending entirely on distrust, on disconnection, on mutability by principle, on systematic weakness in every particular member; it is impossible that the total result should be <b>substantial</b> <b>strength</b> of any kind.|$|E

40|$|Impact {{assessment}} {{has been}} in place for over 40 years and is now practised in some form in all but two of the world's nations. In this paper we reflect {{on the state of the}} art of impact assessment theory and practice, focusing on six well-established forms: EIA, SEA, policy assessment, SIA, HIA and sustainability assessment. We note that although the fundamentals of impact assessment have their roots in the US National Environmental Policy Act 1969 (NEPA) each branch of the field is distinct in also drawing on other theoretical and conceptual bases that in turn shape the prevailing discourse in each case, generating increasing degrees of specialisation within each sub-field. Against this backdrop, we consider the strengths and weaknesses of collective impact assessment practice, concluding that although there are <b>substantial</b> <b>strengths,</b> the plethora of specialist branches is generating a somewhat confusing picture and lack of clarity regarding how the pieces of the impact assessment jigsaw puzzle fit together. We use this review to suggest an overarching research agenda that will enable impact assessment to evolve in line with changing expectations for what it should deliver. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|The SPS {{wideband}} transverse {{feedback system}} {{is being developed}} to control vertical beam instabilities arising from intensity dependent effects like electron cloud instability (ECI) and the transverse mode coupling instability (TMCI). As part of the LHC Injector Upgrade (LIU) project, a wideband kicker is necessary as a damper to control unstable modes within a bunch. Several types of kicker structures, including cavities, striplines, and slotted structures have been studied to evaluate the operating bandwidth, transverse shunt impedance, and beam coupling impedance. Studies and results from all structures are described below, including three potential paths to implement these structures as a wideband kicker system. A single, slotted-coaxial kicker of 1 m length provides <b>substantial</b> kick <b>strength</b> (integrated transverse voltage) over a bandwidth ranging from nearly DC to 1 GHz. An array of four 10 cm long striplines provides <b>substantial</b> kick <b>strength</b> from DC to 750 MHz. For a given amplifier power of 500 W, the array of striplines can provide twice the transverse detecting voltage as the slotted kicker for frequencies up to 200 MHz. At frequencies 800 - 1000 MHz the transverse voltage generated by the slotted kicker dominates that of the stripline array. We recommend to CERN that both the slotted-coaxial kicker and the array of striplines should undergo more detailed mechanical design and be built as prototype wideband kickers for installation in the SPS...|$|R

50|$|The {{existence}} {{of millions of}} homeless youths led to widespread juvenile delinquency throughout Russia. When street children looked beyond begging and petty trade, they turned to stealing. Juvenile crime rose rapidly during World War I with its growth rate increasing during the famine of 1921-1922, at which point juvenile crime was increasing more rapidly than adult crime. Minors arrested by the Russian police stood at 6% of all people apprehended in 1920, and reached 10% by {{the first quarter of}} 1922. More than other factors, hunger prompted waifs to steal. Robberies became routine, a natural feature of survival on the street. On the street, crime could be a form of amusement and adventure. For many waifs, particularly boys, it was an essential “means of proving one’s reliability and prowess” to the rest of a gang. Abandoned children arriving from the countryside were often slower to embrace thievery than those from urban backgrounds, but in general, the longer a child was left astray, the more likely he or she was to succumb to crime. Gangs and groups of children as large as ten or thirty ambushed individuals for their belongings; even healthy men of <b>substantial</b> <b>strength</b> were constantly at risk of being beaten and robbed. Constant illegal activity and life in the street insured contact between besprizornye and the criminal underworld of adults; older vagabonds schooled young newcomers in the art of crime. Street life also forced abandoned children into a torrent of drugs and sex. Tobacco and alcohol addictions ran rampant, and {{the first half of the}} 1920s saw the influx of a larger supply of cocaine as well as the development of a more extensive network of drug dealers. Urchins lived and worked in the midst of this network and drug expenses spurred on juveniles’ thefts. In addition to drugs, the street introduced large percentages of its inhabitants to early sexual activity. Waifs generally began their sex lives by the age of fourteen, many girls as early as seven. Rape was pervasive in the underworld and waifs were quickly saturated with sexually transmitted diseases. Crime, drugs, sex, and the harsh nature of life on the street caused a deep imprint on generations of abandoned children. Besprizornye developed and vividly displayed qualities considered threatening by the rest of society. Homelessness yielded bitter fruit: the revolution’s offspring were victims of personality problems, terrible hygiene habits, and severe psychopathic disorders. Despite besprizornye’s deep moral and physical deformities the Soviet government set out not only to save them, but also to develop them into the builders and inheritors of a new, communist society.|$|E

50|$|Sway may be {{an element}} of both {{stationary}} and moving dance figures. In moving figures, sway is commonly achieved as a natural result of body swing, but small amounts from other sources may be useful as an inflection. Sway comes primarily from an incline of the entire body, but a portion may also come from gradual bending of the trunk. It is customary to consider any bending of the trunk to occur more as a stretching of {{one side of the}} rib cage more than as a compression of the other side.

We {{introduce a new}} class of linear donor-bridge-acceptor light-emitting molecules, which enable solution-processed LEDs with near- 100 % internal quantum efficiency at high brightness. Key to this performance is their rapid and efficient utilization of triplet states. Using time-resolved spectroscopy, we establish that luminescence via triplets occurs within 350 ns at ambient temperature, after reverse intersystem crossing to singlets. We find that molecular geometries exist at which the singlet-triplet energy gap (exchange energy) is close to zero, such that rapid interconversion is possible. Calculations indicate that exchange energy is tuned by relative rotation of donor and acceptor moieties about the bridge.
