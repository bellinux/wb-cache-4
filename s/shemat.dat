40|$|In {{the last}} decade, an {{increasing}} {{attention has been}} given to the development of repairing capabilities in materials, with an emphasis in specific strategies that can promote self-healing, with or without external triggers. Self-healing has opened several new possibilities, especially in applications where long-term reliability is demanded and either maintenance or replace of these materials is difficult to perform. Depending on the material class, different approaches in order to achieve self-healing, can be adopted. This led to distinct evaluation methods of the self-healing efficiency, depending on the material and its final use. One of the new challenges in self-repairing materials lays in the establishment of a common testing procedure for different materials classes, such as ceramics, concrete, polymers and composites. Normalized procedures can conduct to a standardization of the healing evaluation, which will set a common ground towards {{a better understanding of the}} concept and its quantification. The assessment of self-healing capabilities is one of the major goals in the <b>SHeMat</b> project. <b>SHeMat</b> is a Training Network for Self-Healing Materials funded within the scope of the Seventh Framework Programme by the European Commission's Marie Curie programme. The focus of this work will be the development of a standard procedure and its applicability to the specific materials developed within the project. The comparative analysis of the results will act as a support to establish a common base for the definition of self-healing as a quantifiable characteristic. This discussion covers the work that has been conducted so far in the <b>SHeMat</b> project and possible future directions...|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{effective}} finite difference formulation for implementing multiple ground heat exchangers (GHE) in the 3 -D coupled heat and flow transport model <b>SHEMAT</b> (Simulator of Heat and Mass Transport, Clauser, 2003) The GHE with arbitrary length can be coaxial {{as well as}} U-shaped. The new approach {{does not require the}} fine discretization of the GHE assemblage since it considers heat transport between fluid and the soil through pipes and grout via thermal resistances. Therefore, the simulation time can be significantly reduced. The coupling with <b>SHEMAT</b> is realized by introducing an effective heat generation. Due to this connection, it is possible to consider heterogeneous geological models, as well as the influence of groundwater flow. This is particularly interesting when studying the long term behavior of a single GHE or a GHE field. The model is validated against the existing GHE modeling codes EED and EWS. A comparison with monitoring data from a deep GHE in Switzerland shows a good agreement. A synthetic example demonstrates the usages and field of application of this new numerical tool...|$|E
40|$|Many popular {{groundwater}} modeling {{codes are}} based on the finite-differences or finite-volume method for orthogonal grids. In cases of complex subsurface geometries this type of grid leads either to coarse geometric representations or to extreme large meshes. We use a coordinate transformation method (CTM) to circumvent this shortcoming. In computational fluid dynamics (CFD), this method has been successfully applied to the general Navier-Stokes equation. The method is based on tensor analysis and performs a transformation of a curvilinear into a rectangular unit grid, on which a modified formulation of the differential equations is applied. Therefore {{it is not necessary to}} reformulate the code in total. We have applied the CTM to an existing three-dimensional code (<b>SHEMAT),</b> a simulator for heat conduction and advection in porous media. The finite-volume discretization scheme for the non-orthogonal hexahedral grid leads to a 19 -point stencil and a corresponding banded system matrix. The implementation is straightforward and it is possible to use some existing routines without modification.

40|$|Well doublet ground source {{heating and}} cooling systems are rapidly {{becoming}} a popular alternative to conventional {{heating and cooling}} systems in the UK, principally because of the substantial reduction in carbon emissions that can be achieved. The sustainability of such systems, and their expected lifetime, is largely governed by {{the fate of the}} waste heat following re-injection into the aquifer. Numerical modelling using the reactive transport model <b>SHEMAT</b> (Simulator for HEat and MAss Transport) has been undertaken to determine the feasibility of a groundwater-based cooling scheme to remove heat generated by a UK laboratory. The proposed scheme involves the use of groundwater, pumped from a single abstraction borehole drilled into a sandstone aquifer, to feed a heat exchanger cooling system with re-injection back into the aquifer via three injection boreholes. A series of simulations have been undertaken to determine the optimum configuration of the abstraction and recharge boreholes to minimize the effects on the aquifer. To prolong the thermal breakthrough time at the abstraction well, it is concluded that the abstraction borehole must be located up the hydraulic gradient from the three recharge boreholes...|$|E
40|$|In {{a context}} more {{favourable}} to renewable energies, various aquifers are studied to feed heating and/or cooling systems. The groundwater flow and heat transport are modelled in the alluvial aquifer {{of the river}} Meuse {{in order to provide}} an integrated tool for assessing the feasibility of a low energy air cooling /heating system for a large office building by pumping groundwater and discharging in the river. First, a comparative sensitivity analysis is performed using three different codes (MT 3 D, <b>SHEMAT</b> and HYDROGEOSHERE) for assessing the influence of coupling and non linearities in the main parameters due to the temperature evolution in function of time. Then, assuming that the variations of the aquifer temperature are weak enough to neglect their influence on hydrodynamics and thermal parameters, the MT 3 D and HYDROGEOSPHERE codes are used for modelling the actual case-study. In practice, for cooling the office building with groundwater initially at 13 °C, the main influence of the relative hot water from the river Meuse (in hot summer conditions 27 °C) is computed and constitutes the major limiting factor. An optimisation of the pumping schema is computed to maximise the efficiency of the cooling/heating system. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|English Summary Intrusion of magma {{into the}} Earth's crust is {{associated}} with significant thermal perturbations, release of aqeuous fluids and formation of hydrothermal system. In order {{to better understand the}} feedback relationships between fluid flow, thermal evolution and permeability variations, we have modeled conductive and advective cooling of a shallow- crustal pluton using the <b>SHEMAT</b> software. Our model represents a two-dimensional cross section through the lithosphere with homogeneous material properties, whebery the heat and mass conservation equations are solved by finite difference method. We first calculate the stable lithospheric geotherm by emplying constant basal thermal flow of 40 mW m- 2 and a constant surface temperature. Subsequently, we consider a rectangular magmatic intrusion emplaced at 5 - 10 km depth, which forms a contact aureole by conductive cooling. With time, a mushroom-like shape of the contact aureole is predicted. Inclusion of aqueous fluid flow into the model causes only a small alteration of thermal evolution mainly because the permeability is low and the fluid mass is negligible due to very low density under hydrothermal conditions. In addition to thermal effects, we have explored variations in hydraulic head in order to address the ensuing effects on the flow velocity. The [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Various {{aquifers}} are {{studied in}} terms of low temperature geothermal potential. The feasibility and impact studies of these systems imply very often a numerical simulation of groundwater flow and heat transport. Nowadays, some finite element or finite difference codes are {{able to deal with}} such non linear simulations. On a synthetic case study and then on a real case study, a detailed comparative sensitivity analysis is performed using three different codes (MT 3 DMS, <b>SHEMAT</b> and HYDROGEOSHERE). For low temperatures and relatively small temperature changes, it appears rapidly that the uncertainty affecting values of the main hydrodynamic parameters (i. e. hydraulic conductivity) influences more the results than taking into account any coupling or non linearity. For a case study, the pumping and associated groundwater flow and heat transport are modeled in an alluvial aquifer interacting with a main river in order to assess feasibility of a low energy air cooling /heating system for a large office building. The worst case scenario corresponds to hot summer conditions simultaneously with river maximum temperature and the model leads to an optimization with intermittent pumping in minimum 6 wells. Numerical codes are ready to simulate complex groundwater flow, solute transport and heat transport situations in aquifers, however efforts must be realized to obtain reliable experimental in-situ measured values for the hydro-thermal properties.

40|$|Policies against {{global warming}} are {{generating}} mechanisms favorable to renewable energies. In particular, {{the development of}} geothermal expertise has considerably increased these last years and numbers of various environments are henceforth studied and worked to feed heating and/or cooling systems. However numerical models, allowing to simulate these processes by integrating the maximum of the available information, are still seldom used in this domain. In this work, {{the basic principles of}} geothermal processes are first described. Then, the governing equations for heat transfer in saturated porous media are detailed and the analogies between heat transfer and solute transport are established. Due to the general lack of specific data, the currently available techniques for measuring and evaluating the two main parameters of the subsoil, the thermal conductivity λ and the specific heat capacity c, are reviewed. The main purpose of this work consists in modeling the flow and the heat transfer within the alluvial aquifer of the Meuse in Liège with the aim to set up a system of air conditioning by pumping the groundwater. Two numerical codes are used and compared: MT 3 D/MODFLOW (finite differences) and HGS (finite elements). The variations of the aquifer temperature are assumed to be weak enough to neglect their influence on hydrodynamics and thermal parameters. A simplified situation is however simulated by means of both previous codes and of software Processing <b>Shemat</b> to validate this hypothesis and to estimate the approximation it could generate in this kind of problem...|$|E
40|$|Innovative and {{efficient}} strategies for energy utilization become a priority, {{especially in the}} civil engineering sector. Geothermal open-loop systems (geothermal wells) are not so developed in Belgium contrary to close-loop systems. This is generally {{due to the lack}} of relevant dimensioning and impact study that must be foreseen during the planning phases of the building. However, as shallow groundwater is widely available, geothermal wells potential is significant. Using both experimental and numerical tools, our aim is to develop a rigorous methodology to design heating and cooling shallow geothermal wells (pumping/reinjection), with a detailed hydrogeological characterization, coupled to feasibility, environmental impact assessment, dimensioning and system sustainability. Groundwater flow and heat transport is computed using different numerical codes (HydroGeoSphere, MT 3 DMS and <b>SHEMAT)</b> for a comparative sensitivity analysis on a typical case. Coupling and temperature non linearities of the hydro-thermal parameters values are checked accurately. As shown previously, small temperature variations, allow to use conventional solute transport codes modeling heat transport in groundwater taking benefits of the similarities between solute and heat transport equations. When numerical codes are used as dimensioning tools for long-term simulations, reliable values for hydro-thermal properties of the aquifer are essential. Very few experimental values are available in the literature. Field experiments are needed to determine more accurately the local values in different geological/hydrogeological conditions. Apart from thermal response tests (TRT) usually performed for designing a close-loop system within a borehole considered in static groundwater conditions, there is no standard procedure for geothermal wells systems. In an open groundwater system, groundwater movement induced by the pumping (convection) is a major heat transport process and cannot be neglected. A pilote site is currently studied for optimizing methods in such low temperature geothermal systems. The field experiments include: pumping tests (for hydraulic conductivities to be used for dimensioning tracer and heat tracing tests), solute tracer tests, heat tracing tests. Hot water injection, is combined with downstream pumping and intermediate temperature and pressure monitoring piezometers for detection of the heat plume shape. Natural temperature variations, due to air temperature day/night and interseasonal cycles and also induced by the river proximity, are filtered. The test characteristics and first results are detailed showing that the combined use of solute tracer tests and heat tracing tests leads to a better characterization of the local hydro-thermal properties.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to obtain {{information}} on the groundwater flow regime at great depth within the Molasse Basin (SW Germany). For this purpose different numerical codes are applied. For an optimal geometrical representation of the basin geometry {{it was necessary to}} develop a coordinate transformation method. This work is presented {{in the first part of}} the thesis. Many popular groundwater modeling codes are based on the finite differences or finite volume method for orthogonal grids. In cases of complex subsurface geometries this type of grid either leads to coarse geometric representations or to extremely fine meshes. Therefore, a coordinate transformation method has been developed to circumvent this shortcoming. In computational fluid dynamics (CFD), this method has been applied successfully to the general Navier-Stokes equation. The method is based on tensor analysis and performs a transformation of a curvilinear into a rectangular unit grid, on which a modified formulation of the differential equations is applied. Due to this it is not necessary to reformulate existing simulation code in total. The coordinate transformation method was applied to the three-dimensional code <b>SHEMAT,</b> a simulator for flow and heat transport in porous media. The finite volume discretization scheme for the non-orthogonal, structured, hexahedral grid yields a 19 -point stencil and a correspondingly banded system matrix. The implementation is straightforward and it is possible to use many existing routines without modification. The accuracy of the modified code is demonstrated for single-phase flow on a two-dimensional analytical solution for flow and heat transport and further on a thermal free-convection benchmark. Additionally, a simple two-dimensional case of potential flow is shown for a grid which is increasingly deformed. The result reveals that the error increases only slightly. In the second part the actual basin analysis is shown and discussed. Data relevant for a flow model at depth between 600 m to 1600 m below the surface are generally sparse in the western part of the Molasse Basin. However, a relatively large set of temperature measurements is available covering a large part of the area at a wide range of depths. Therefore, a thermal 3 -D quasi steady-state model was set up with the aim of comparing modeled with measured subsurface temperatures. Additional to the temperature data, some values of rock thermal conductivity and heat production rate are available. Other data are too sparsely distributed to be useful. The purely conductive model reveals some strong thermal anomalies, especially along fault zones, and within stratigraphic layers with high hydraulic conductivity. While temperature in the upper crust is dominated by conductive heat transport, heat advection associated with groundwater flow may significantly alter the purely conductive regime. The thermal anomalies can be explained by various advective heat transport mechanisms - yet most of them can be eliminated: The only constellation explaining the major positive thermal anomalies of 10 K and more is a fault zone intersected by an aquifer with flow parallel to the fault zone. This was validated by using a simplified type model. In spite of some shortcomings, the method presented here can be used to identify temperature anomalies, and in a second step, to identify possible explanations...|$|E
40|$|The ground {{freezing}} method {{has recently been}} given a boost as a versatile technique to provide artificially frozen ground as impervious and bearing support structures for tunneling applications. Excavation can proceed safely inside the frozen ground structure until the final lining provides permanent support. In contrast to grouting works the freezing method is completely reversible and has no significant environmental impact. Ground freezing is not limited by adverse ground conditions and {{may be used in}} almost any soil formation, regardless of structure and grain size. The excavation of cross-passages and the widening of shield-driven tunnel cross-sections to build underground stations are main fields of application. However, often the alleged high costs for the supply of energy are the exclusion criterion for a systematic and scheduled application of the method. The optimization of {{ground freezing}} projects requires a reliable prediction of frost propagation as vital design criterion. Existing groundwater flow is the crucial factor and major thermal load that requires intensive consideration for a safe and cost-effective freezing project. Due to the temperature-dependent behaviour of frozen soil, the latent heat released at phase change and the thermal impact of flowing water the analytical approaches known so far for the design of frozen support structures can only inadequately assess the complex phenomena. Only numerical simulations can provide solutions to the coupled heat flow-groundwater problem but are not easily applicable in the majority of cases. Within this thesis the Finite Difference Program <b>SHEMAT</b> (Simulator for Heat and Mass Transfer) is further developed to provide a practical, numerical analysis tool to predict frost propagation of ground freezing projects that are subject to groundwater flow. The main focus lies on sufficiently accurate determination of freezing times based on a few geotechnical parameters only. For this purpose a simplified phase change model is set up to describe the freezing process in fully saturated soils. The unfrozen water content is used as main variable of the freezing stage and allows deriving thermal properties of the soil, namely thermal conductivity and thermal capacity, by mathematical models. By means of experiments it is shown, that the unfrozen water content can be derived from the grain size curve {{with a high degree of}} accuracy in case of non-cohesive soils. The numerical model is verified by an analytical approach of frost propagation and by recalculation of two model experiments. The reanalysis of a real ground freezing project shows good results and reveals the essential demand to know the flow conditions on site for reliable calculations. Using the example of the freezing of a cross passage flow-adapted freeze pipe arrangements and optimized operating modes of the cooling units are presented to achieve considerable cost saving potentials. It becomes obvious that the freezing time increases exponentially with flow velocity and different designs may become advantageous for different velocities. Even without additional installation of freeze pipes the freezing time can be reduced by 20 % using flow adapted freeze pipe arrangements. Additional freeze pipes on the critical upstream side can reduce freezing times by almost 50 %. The most advantageous reduction is achieved by precooling the groundwater by positioning pipes in the upstream. Moreover, the operating mode can be modified by the assembly of pipe groups with respect to their specific thermal impact of the groundwater flow. As a consequence the energy supply can be reduced by selectively charging these groups. The simplified, numerical model presented in this thesis provides opportunities to optimize future ground freezing applications subject to groundwater flow...|$|E
