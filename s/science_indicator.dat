40|$|Abstract—Software Reusability is primary {{attribute}} of software quality. There are metrics for identifying {{the quality of}} reusable components but the function that makes use of these metrics to find reusability of software components is still not clear. These metrics if identified in the design phase {{or even in the}} coding phase can help us to reduce the rework by improving quality of reuse of the component and hence improve the productivity due to probabilistic increase in the reuse level. In this paper, we have devised the framework of metrics that uses McCabe’s Cyclometric Complexity Measure for Complexity measurement, Regularity Metric, Halstead Software <b>Science</b> <b>Indicator</b> for Volume indication, Reuse Frequency metric and Coupling Metric values of the software component as input attributes and calculated reusability of the software component. Here, comparative analysis of the fuzzy, Neuro-fuzzy and Fuzzy-GA approaches is performed to evaluate the reusability of software components and Fuzzy-GA results outperform the other used approaches. The developed reusability model has produced high precision results as expected by the human experts...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} the {{application}} of the neural network for the identification of Reusable Software modules in Procedure Oriented Software System. Metrics are used for the structural analysis of the different procedures. The proposed metrics for Procedure oriented paradigm are Cyclometric Complexity Using Mc Cabe‟s Measure, Halstead Software <b>Science</b> <b>Indicator,</b> Regularity Metric, Reuse frequency metric, Coupling Metric. The values of these Metrics will become the input dataset for the different neural network systems. Neural Network Based Approach is used to establish the relationship between different attributes of the reusability and serve as the automatic tool for the Evaluation of the reusability of the procedures by calculating the relationship based on its training. Different Eleven Training Algorithms of neural network are experimented and the results are recorded in terms of Accuracy, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The results show that Conjugate Gradient with Powell/Beale Restarts (CGB) is best for the evaluation of reusable modules of procedure oriented software systems. Hence the proposed model can be used to improve the productivity and quality of software development...|$|E

25|$|Among the 22 {{scientific}} disciplines {{listed in the}} Thomson Reuters Essential <b>Science</b> <b>Indicators</b> Citation Thresholds, physics has the second most citations after space science. During the period January 1, 2000 – February 28, 2010, a physicist had to receive 2073 citations {{to be among the}} most cited 1% of physicists in the world. The threshold for space science is the highest (2236 citations), and physics is followed by clinical medicine (1390) and molecular biology & genetics (1229). Most disciplines, such as environment/ecology (390), have fewer scientists, fewer papers, and fewer citations. Therefore, these disciplines have lower citation thresholds in the Essential <b>Science</b> <b>Indicators,</b> with the lowest citation thresholds observed in social sciences (154), computer science (149), and multidisciplinary sciences (147).|$|R

The article discusses historically the emergence of <b>science</b> <b>indicators</b> and some of the methodological problems involved. More recent developments have been induced by the emergence of the European Union as a supra-national level of policy coordination and by the Internet as a global medium of communication.
