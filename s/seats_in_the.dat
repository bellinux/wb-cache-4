5|$|During its 2002 annual session, the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) added 14 {{amendments}} to the Constitution of Indonesia. Included in these amendments were measures to reorganize the legislature. Beginning in 2004, the MPR was composed of the existing People's Representative Council (DPR) and a new Regional Representative Council (DPD). Because all the <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> MPR were directly elected, this called for removal of the military from the legislature, whose 38 <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Assembly were appointed. This change and an amendment for direct election of the President and Vice President were major steps for Indonesia on the road towards a full democracy.|$|E

By the time of the 1886 Congressional elections, Blaine was giving speeches and promoting Republican candidates, especially {{in his home state of}} Maine. Republicans were successful in Maine, and after the Maine elections in September, Blaine went on a speaking tour from Pennsylvania to Tennessee, hoping to boost the prospects of Republican candidates there. Republicans were less successful nationwide, gaining <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House while losing <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Senate, but Blaine’s speeches kept him and his opinions in the spotlight.|$|E
5|$|Canada uses a Westminster-style {{parliamentary}} government, {{in which}} {{the leader of the}} party with the most <b>seats</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Commons becomes Prime Minister, even {{if he or she is}} not an elected member of parliament.

When the party with the most seats has less than half of the total number of seats, it forms a minority government, which can be voted out of power by the other parties. The Canadian Parliament is located at Parliament Hill in the capital city, Ottawa.
