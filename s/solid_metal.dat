5|$|The figurine that {{is awarded}} to prize winners {{originated}} from a competition {{held by the}} local newspaper Haugesunds Avis in 1985, to create a sculpture of the legendary Amanda. The competition was won by Kristian Kvakland from Nesodden in Akershus. The full-size sculpture now stands outside the newspaper's office, but a miniature version was adopted as a trophy for the Amanda Award. The figurine is 30cm (11.81in) tall, with a skirt measuring 14cm (5.51in) in diameter. While the current sculpture is hollow and weighs 2.5kg (5.51lbs), {{for the first few}} years it was made of <b>solid</b> <b>metal.</b> Weighing in at 4.5kg (9.92lbs) it was difficult to hoist for many winners.|$|E

A cylinder containing 200kPa (29.0psig/43.8psia) or greater at 20°C (68°F) of non-flammable, nonpoisonous compressed gas, and being transported for commercial purposes is classified as HAZMAT (hazardous materials) in terms of 49 CFR 173.115(b) (1). Cylinders manufactured to DOT standards or special permits (exemptions)issued by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and filled to the authorized working pressure are legal for commercial transport in the USA under the provisions and conditions of the regulations.

5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 18th century, Britain, and later {{continental}} Europe and the United States, experienced the Industrial Revolution. This was the first time during which production rates exceeded those of Rome. Britain was the leading producer, losing this status by the mid-19th century with the depletion of its mines and the development of lead mining in Germany, Spain, and the United States. By 1900, the United States was the leader in global lead production, and other non-European nations—Canada, Mexico, and Australia—had begun significant production; production outside Europe exceeded that within. A great share of the demand for lead came from plumbing and painting—lead paints were in regular use. At this time, more (working class) people were exposed to the metal and lead poisoning cases escalated. This led to research into the effects of lead intake. Lead was proven to be more dangerous in its fume form than as a <b>solid</b> <b>metal.</b> Lead poisoning and gout were linked; British physician Alfred Baring Garrod noted a third of his gout patients were plumbers and painters. The effects of chronic ingestion of lead, including mental disorders, were also studied in the 19th century. The first laws aimed at decreasing lead poisoning in factories were enacted during the 1870s and 1880s in the United Kingdom.|$|E

25|$|PYRO-A is a {{means of}} {{separating}} actinides (elements within the actinide family, generally heavier than U-235) from non-actinides. The spent fuel is placed in an anode basket which is immersed in a molten salt electrolyte.

Many of the fission products (such as caesium, zirconium and strontium) remain in the salt.

More negative standard electrode potentials were found to be good predictors of <b>solid</b> <b>metals</b> that had tastes scoring highest for the taste descriptors strong, bitter, and metallic. Thus, it was found that both gold and chrome (having the most positive standard electrode potentials) were considered the least metallic, least bitter and least strong tasting of the spoons.

We conclude that gold and chrome have tastes that are less strong than metals with lower standard electrode potential...|$|R
25|$|Iron is also {{corroded}} {{much more}} easily in seawater than lead, and would need some form of protection to prevent rusting. Alloys of stainless steel are more resistant to corrosion, but, for the cheaper grades, need to be rinsed with freshwater after use to prevent corrosion in storage. The cost of shaping alternative materials may be considerably greater, particularly for small quantities. Stainless steel and tungsten dive weights for example are currently only obtainable by milling down a <b>solid</b> <b>metal</b> stock material in block or cylinder form, into the required shape. Direct casting of these materials in a foundry is possible, but would require high volume production for the casting processes to be cost effective.|$|E

25|$|The {{galvanic}} cell uses two different metal electrodes, each in an electrolyte where the positively charged ions are the oxidized {{form of the}} electrode metal. One electrode will undergo oxidation (the anode) and the other will undergo reduction (the cathode). The metal of the anode will oxidize, going from an oxidation state of 0 (in the solid form) to a positive oxidation state and become an ion. At the cathode, the metal ion in solution will accept one or more electrons from the cathode and the ion's oxidation state is reduced to 0. This forms a <b>solid</b> <b>metal</b> that electrodeposits on the cathode. The two electrodes must be electrically connected to each other, allowing for a flow of electrons that leave the metal of the anode and flow through this connection to the ions at {{the surface of the}} cathode. This flow of electrons is an electric current {{that can be used to}} do work, such as turn a motor or power a light.|$|E

25|$|An ammeter shunt is {{a special}} type of current-sensing resistor, having four {{terminals}} and a value in milliohms or even micro-ohms. Current-measuring instruments, by themselves, can usually accept only limited currents. To measure high currents, the current passes through the shunt across which the voltage drop is measured and interpreted as current. A typical shunt consists of two <b>solid</b> <b>metal</b> blocks, sometimes brass, mounted on an insulating base. Between the blocks, and soldered or brazed to them, are one or more strips of low {{temperature coefficient of resistance}} (TCR) manganin alloy. Large bolts threaded into the blocks make the current connections, while much smaller screws provide volt meter connections. Shunts are rated by full-scale current, and often have a voltage drop of 50 mV at rated current. Such meters are adapted to the shunt full current rating by using an appropriately marked dial face; no change need to be made to the other parts of the meter.|$|E
25|$|The {{first part}} of the Gutenberg idea was using a single, hand-carved {{character}} to create identical copies of itself. Cutting a single letter could take a craftsman a day of work. A single page taking 2500 letters made this way was impractical. A less labour-intensive method of reproduction was needed. Copies were produced by stamping the original into an iron plate, called a matrix. A rectangular tube was then connected to the matrix, creating a container in which molten type metal could be poured. Once cooled, the <b>solid</b> <b>metal</b> form was released from the tube. The fundamental innovation is that this matrix can be used to produce many duplicates of the same letter. The result of each molding was a rectangular block of metal with the form of the desired character protruding from the end. This piece of type could be put in a line, facing up, with other pieces of type. These lines were arranged to form blocks of text, which could be inked and pressed against paper, transferring the desired text to the paper.|$|E

40|$|When two <b>solid</b> <b>metals</b> are {{in contact}} at high temperature, interdi usion occurs leading {{in some cases}} to the growth of {{intermetallic}} compounds. The study of nucleation, growth and properties of these intermetallic compounds are of interest since it can be critical for many applications in industries.

The silver–zirconium system will be presented in order to illustrate this new phenomenon. The e ect of contact point on the di usion- reaction process has been modelled by patterning the Zr surface. The nucleation and growth of the intermetallic compounds occur along the contact points which leads to silver surface reconstruction with the growth of the preferential crystal planes f 111 g ad f 100 g.
