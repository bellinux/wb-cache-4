In their absence, an appearance {{similar to that}} of acne would suggest a different <b>skin</b> <b>disorder.</b> Microcomedones (the precursor to blackheads and whiteheads) are not {{visible to the naked eye}} when inspecting the skin and can only be seen with a microscope. There are many features that may indicate a person's acne vulgaris is sensitive to hormonal influences. Historical and physical clues that may suggest hormone-sensitive acne include onset between ages 20 and 30; worsening the week before a woman's menstrual cycle; acne lesions predominantly over the jawline and chin; and inflammatory/nodular acne lesions.|$|E
5|$|Michael Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American {{singer who}} spent over four {{decades in the}} public eye, first as a child star with The Jackson 5, and later as a solo artist, during which time he went through various image changes. Starting in the mid-1980s, {{it became clear that}} Jackson's {{appearance}} was changing dramatically. The shape of his face, particularly his nose, triggered widespread speculation of extensive cosmetic surgery. His skin tone became much lighter. Although Jackson, a black man, was diagnosed with the <b>skin</b> <b>disorder</b> vitiligo, which results in white patches on the skin, and said that he had not purposely bleached his skin but had used makeup to even out his skin tone, it was also widely suggested that his lighter skin tone was partly due to skin bleaching.|$|E
5|$|Some parasites feed on giraffes. They {{are often}} hosts for ticks, {{especially}} {{in the area around}} the genitals, which has thinner skin than other areas. Tick species that commonly feed on giraffes are those of genera Hyalomma, Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus. Giraffes may rely on red-billed and yellow-billed oxpeckers to clean them of ticks and alert them to danger. Giraffes host numerous species of internal parasite and are susceptible to various diseases. They were victims of the (now eradicated) viral illness rinderpest. Giraffes can also suffer from a <b>skin</b> <b>disorder,</b> which {{comes in the form of}} wrinkles, lesions or raw fissures.

40|$|Abstract Background To {{evaluate}} whether occupational stress factors (high demands, low control, low social support, strain, and iso-strain) {{are associated with}} <b>skin</b> <b>disorders</b> in hospital workers and whether psychological problems, such as anxiety and depression, act as potential mechanisms through which occupational stress factors are associated with <b>skin</b> <b>disorders.</b> Methods 1, 744 hospital workers were invited to answer a questionnaire concerning the occurrence of <b>skin</b> <b>disorders</b> and psychosocial factors at work. The abbreviated Italian version of the Demand/Control model (Karasek) {{was used to assess}} perceived work strain, while the Goldberg scales were used to assess anxiety and depression. Analyses were adjusted for age, gender, occupation, latex glove use and history of atopy. Results Of the participants, 25 % reported hand dermatitis in the previous 12 months and 35 % had been affected by <b>skin</b> <b>disorders</b> {{in other parts of the}} body. High job demands (OR = 1. 09 CI 95 % 1. 05 - 1. 14), low social support (OR = 0. 90, CI 95 % 0. 87 - 0. 93), high strain (OR = 1. 54 CI 95 % 1. 20 - 1. 98) and high iso-strain (1. 66 CI 95 % 1. 27 - 2. 19) were all associated with a higher prevalence of reported hand <b>skin</b> <b>disorders.</b> Both depression (OR = 2. 50 CI 95 % 1. 99 - 3. 14) and anxiety (OR = 2. 29 CI 95 % 1. 81 - 2. 89) were associated with higher risk of hand <b>skin</b> <b>disorders.</b> The same pattern was observed for dermatological complaints in other parts of the body. Only a slight reduction in the association between occupational stress variables and <b>skin</b> <b>disorders</b> was observed after including depression and anxiety in the model. Conclusions Job stress plays a significant role in triggering <b>skin</b> <b>disorders</b> among hospital workers and psychological problems do not appear to be the mechanism behind this association. Occupational health education and training should focus on reducing job demands and occupational stress in order to prevent skin problems among hospital workers. </p...|$|R
