25|$|The interrogations were {{repeated}} every two weeks, but the interrogators compared notes to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> any discrepancies. Refusing to answer questions, lying, disrespect to the interrogators, {{and a number}} of other infractions were punished by a beating with wooden clubs. Guards often beat prisoners or slapped them in the face for the slightest infraction, or at times at random. Officers typically faced harsher treatment than enlisted ranks. Inmates also claimed that Ōfuna guards were often sadistic, enjoying the beating and clubbing of inmates.|$|E
25|$|In various NFL Films {{productions}} {{about the}} play years later, various Raiders have theorized {{that the real}} purpose of Swearingen's phone conversation was to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> enough police on hand to ensure the players' safety if the play was ruled incomplete, and was then called in the Steelers' favor out of fear, Swearingen was told when asking how many police officers were present that there were only six policemen, so he calls for six points and a touchdown. In one of them, McNally laughs at the suggestion.|$|E

2500|$|In autumn 1934, Georgescu {{went to the}} New World; {{but upon}} {{arriving}} at Harvard University, {{he learned that the}} Economic Barometer had been shut down years before: The project had completely failed to predict the Wall Street Crash of 1929, and was soon abandoned altogether. After several failed attempts to find another sponsor for his research, Georgescu finally managed to set up a meeting with the professor at the university teaching business cycles to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> any other opportunities available for him. This professor happened to be Joseph Schumpeter.|$|E
2500|$|Serious Young Insects {{had formed}} in 1980 with Peter Farnan on vocals and guitar, Michael Vallance on vocals and bass guitar and Mark White on vocals and drums. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, {{described}} Serious Young Insects as a [...] "quirky, three-piece Melbourne new wave band". They issued an album, Housebreaking (May 1982), and three singles. Lisa Perry of The Canberra Times praised the album [...] "several times I {{had to check}} the cover to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> not also some session musos or others contributing to the sounds I was hearing. For a three-piece combo, these lads sure make a good sound". Pleasance, a classically trained guitarist, was a fan and briefly joined the group before it broke up in the following year.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2004, Anderson {{was criticized}} in an Anchorage Daily News {{editorial}} for signing a $10,000 contract in 2003 with the Alaska oilfield services company VECO Corporation to consult [...] "on local government and community council affairs." [...] Anderson had earlier told the Anchorage Daily News that he'd {{been approached by}} VECO {{after the end of}} the 2003 legislative session because it was aware he'd done similar consulting work before he became a legislator. He told the newspaper that most of his work for VECO was in seeking out civic and charitable events for the company to get involved in, and that he also monitored Anchorage's community councils to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> zoning cases or other issues under discussion that might affect VECO. [...] The newspaper noted that Anderson had received about $4,000 in campaign contributions from VECO employees or their spouses [...] in the 2002 election that won him his first term in the Alaska House. By July 2004 he had received at least $3,500 in VECO-related contributions for his 2004 reelection bid.|$|E

50|$|Lawrence {{asked him}} if he had ever {{discovered}} any thing with the plates of gold; he said no: he then asked him to look in his stone, to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> any thing with them.
