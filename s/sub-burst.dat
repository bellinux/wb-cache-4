The purpose was to separate the effects of structural property variations from changes caused by differences in the sample geometry. The position and shape of the leading MAE <b>sub-burst</b> and its variation among the samples are explained by magnetic anisotropy and the results of numerical simulations which utilized the concept of self-organized criticality (SOC).

3000|$|Besides the first-column slots, the DD {{estimation}} method {{can also be}} used to improve the BER performance of other slots if the following allocation rule is adopted. Each coded FEC block in the bursts is assigned to consecutive slots in the same pair of OFDMA symbols, such as the blocks in symbols 3 and 4 depicted in Figure  6. This is referred to as the second allocation rule. As a coded FEC block has a size of at most six slots, the proposed block allocation is possible. If the BS fills each FEC block with a HARQ <b>sub-burst,</b> the receiver can employ the error detection mechanism in each <b>sub-burst</b> to verify the correctness of the decoded FEC blocks. Even for an FEC block without any error detection mechanism, the receiver still can use the threshold method proposed in [19] to determine the correctness of the decoded block. If the FEC blocks are correctly decoded, decoded data bits can be re-encoded to enable the DD {{estimation method}} for the blocks (slots) in the next pair of OFDMA symbols. Note that if an FEC block is incorrectly decoded, the MS should not use the DD estimation scheme for blocks in the next pair of symbols. The reason is that one error data bit, after convolutional re-encoding, may incur several error coded bits, which in turn are mapped into several incorrect [...]...|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{contention}} resolution diversity slotted ALOHA (CRDSA) {{has been}} introduced as a simple but effective improvement to slotted ALOHA. It relies on MAC burst repetitions and on interference cancellation to increase the normalized throughput of a classic slotted ALOHA access scheme. CRDSA allows achieving a larger throughput than slotted ALOHA, {{at the price of}} an increased average transmitted power. A way to trade-off the increment of the average transmitted power and the improvement of the throughput is presented in this paper. Specifically, it is proposed to divide each MAC burst in k <b>sub-bursts,</b> and to encode them via a (n,k) erasure correcting code. The n encoded <b>sub-bursts</b> are transmitted over the MAC channel, according to specific time/frequency-hopping patterns. Whenever n-e>=k <b>sub-bursts</b> (of the same burst) are received without collisions, erasure decoding allows recovering the remaining e <b>sub-bursts</b> (which were lost due to collisions). An interference cancellation process can then take place, removing in e slots the interference caused by the e recovered <b>sub-bursts,</b> possibly allowing the correct decoding of <b>sub-bursts</b> related to other bursts. The process is thus iterated as for the CRDSA case. Comment: Presented at the Future Network and MobileSummit 2010 Conference, Florence (Italy), June 201...|$|R

The burst was recorded on 7 June, 2011 in the frequency band 3 [...] 33 ~MHz. It was characterized by extremely rich fine structure. The statistical analysis of more than 300 herringbone <b>sub-bursts</b> constituting the burst was performed separately for the positively (reverse) and negatively (forward) drifting <b>sub-bursts.</b> The sense {{and the degree of}} circular polarization of the herringbone <b>sub-bursts</b> were measured in the respectively wide frequency band (16 [...] 32 ~MHz). A second order fine frequency structure of the herringbone <b>sub-bursts</b> was firstly observed and processed. Using STEREO COR 1 (A,B) and SOHO LASCO C 2 images the direction and radial speed of the CME responsible for the studied type II burst were determined.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of data-burst {{grooming}} in optical burst-switched (OBS) networks. In OBS networks, IP packets with the same edge-node destination are assembled into larger packets called data bursts. Depending on the core node’s switching technology, data bursts are required to have a minimum length. On the other hand, each IP packet in a burst has a time delay constraint, called maximum end-to-end delay, which determines the upper time limit before which the packet must reach its destination. Thus, a data burst cannot wait indefinitely until a sufficient number of IP packets are assembled and the minimum burst length requirement is met. In order to satisfy the packet maximum end-to-end delay requirement, many bursts will be timed out and released before they reach the minimumlength requirement. Under such circumstances, padding overhead must be added to these short bursts, called <b>sub-bursts.</b> Excessive padding results in high overhead and high data-burst blocking probability. One approach to minimize the amount of padding overhead, while maintaining the end-to-end delay requirement of IP packets, is to groom multiple <b>sub-bursts</b> together. That is, <b>sub-bursts</b> with different destinations are aggregated together at the edge node and transmitted as a single burst until they are separated at some downstream node. In this paper, we present an edge-node architecture enabling burst-grooming capability. We also develop two basic grooming approaches, namely No routing overhead (NoRO) and minimum total overhead (MinTO). Through a comprehensive simulation study, we show that, in general, our proposed grooming algorithms can significantly improve the performance compared to the case of no grooming. However, careful considerations must be given to network-loading conditions and the number of <b>sub-bursts</b> allowed to be groomed together. We show that although simple greedy algorithms can reduce network overhead, they may alter the traffic characteristics and increase its burstiness, resulting in high packet blocking probability.

40|$|Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) {{are thought}} to arise in {{relativistic}} blast-wave shocks at distances of 10 15. 5 ± 1. 0 cm from {{the point where the}} explosive energy is initially released. 1, 2 To account for the observed duration and variability of the γ-ray emission in most GRBs, a central engine powering the shocks must remain active for several seconds to many minutes but must strongly fluctuate in its output on much shorter timescales. 2 We show how a neutron star differentially rotating at millisecond periods (DROMP) could be such an engine. A magnetized DROMP would repeatedly wind up toroidal magnetic fields to about 10 17 G and only release the corresponding magnetic energy, E> 10 50 erg, when each buoyant magnetic field torus floats up to, and breaks through, the stellar surface. The resulting rapid sub-bursts, separated by relatively quiescent phases, repeat until the kinetic energy of differential rotation is exhausted by these events.

40|$|We {{consider}} the time-dependent behavior of nonstationary accretion disk which is {{formed by the}} capture and disruption of a main-sequence star around a massive black hole. If an instability is developed in the inner edge of the nonstationary disk and produces a strong magnetic field, {{a large amount of}} the black hole rotational energy can be extracted via the Blandford-Znajek process, which results in a Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) with a typical duration ∼ 10 - 102 s. Other parameters related to a typical GRB including burst energy, rise time of the burst, number of <b>sub-burst</b> etc are also estimated. The vertical structure and thermal stability properties of the disk are investigated in detail. In the early stage of forming transient accretion disk, the material supplied by the tidally disrupted star is clumped in the relatively cool disk. This eventually leads to a thermal instability, which results in an increase of the viscosity of the disk. As the instability propagates across the disk, the stability of a time-dependent disk and variability of the mass-deposition rate provide a possible explanation for transient optical emission. We speculate that this transient optical emission from a nonstationary accretion disk may relate to the behavior of GRB optical afterglow, and the transient optical afterglow can be reproduced if one takes into account the effect of an evolving viscous parameter, α. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|A primary {{feature of}} the preterm infant {{electroencephalogram}} {{is the presence of}} large infra-slow potentials containing rapid oscillations called slow activity transients (SATs). Such activity has not been described in animal models, and their generative mechanisms are unknown. Here we use direct-current and multisite extracellular, as well as whole-cell, recording in vivo to demonstrate the existence of regularly repeating SATs in the visual cortex of infant rats before eye opening. Present only in absence of anesthesia, SATs at postnatal day 10 – 11 were identifiable as a separate group of long-duration (� 10 s) events that consisted of large (� 1 mV) negative local-field potentials produced by the summation of multiple bursts of rapid oscillatory activity (15 – 30 Hz). SATs synchronized the vast majority of neuronal activity (87 %) in the visual cortex before eye opening. Enucleation eliminated SATs, and their duration, interevent interval, and <b>sub-burst</b> structure matched those of phase III retinal waves recorded in vitro. Retinal waves, however, lacked rapid oscillations, suggesting that they arise centrally. Multielectrode recordings showed that SATs spread horizontally in cortex and synchronize activity at coactive locales via the rapid oscillations. SATs were clearly different from ongoing cortical activity, which was observable as a separate class of short bursts from postnatal day 9. Together, our data suggest that, in vivo, early cortical activity is primarily determined by peripheral inputs—retinal waves in visual cortex—that provide excitatory input, and by thalamocortical circuitry, which transforms this input to beta oscillations. We propose that the synchronous oscillations of SATs participate in the formation of visual circuitry...|$|E

40|$|One of {{a family}} {{previously}} proposed "central engines" for cosmic gamma-ray burst sources (Kluźniak & Ruderman 1998) is considered in some detail. A steadily accreting 10 ^ 6 Gauss magnetic white dwarf should ultimately collapse to a strongly differentially rotating, millisecond-rotation-period neutron star {{for a wide range}} of steady accretion rates and initial masses if the accreting white dwarf has an evolved O-Ne-Mg composition. A similar neutron star could also result from an initial C-O white dwarf but only for more constrained accretion rates. Because the collapsing white dwarf begins as a γ= 4 / 3 polytrope, the final neutron star's spin-rate increases strongly with cylindrical radius. A stable wind-up of magnetic field perpendicular to the stellar spin then produces buoyant magnetic toroids which grow, break loose, rise, and partly penetrate the neutron star surface to form a transient, B≈ 10 ^ 17 G millisecond spin-period pulsar with a powerful pulsar wind (Usov 1992). This pulsar wind emission is then rapidly suppressed by the surface shear motion from the strong stellar differential rotation. This wind-up and transient pulsar formation can occur at other times on different cylinders and/or repeat on the same one, with (re-) wind up and surface penetration time scales hugely longer han the neutron star's millisecond spin period. In this way, differential rotation both opens and closes the doors which allow neutron star spin-energy to be emitted in powerful bursts of pulsar wind. Predictions of this model compare favorably to needed central engine properties of gamma-ray burst sources (total energy, duration, <b>sub-burst</b> fluctuations and time scales, variability among burst events, and baryon loading) ...|$|E

40|$|The ejecta {{composition}} {{is an open}} question in gamma-ray bursts (GRB) physics. Some GRBs possess a quasi-thermal spectral component in the time-resolved spectral analysis, suggesting a hot fireball origin. Others show a featureless non-thermal spectrum known as the "Band" function, consistent with a synchrotron radiation origin and suggesting that the jet is Poynting-flux-dominated at the central engine and likely in the emission region as well. There are also bursts showing a sub-dominant thermal component and a dominant synchrotron component suggesting a likely hybrid jet composition. Here we report an extraordinarily bright GRB 160625 B, simultaneously observed in gamma-rays and optical wavelengths, whose prompt emission consists of three isolated episodes separated by long quiescent intervals, with the durations of each "sub-burst" being ∼ 0. 8 s, 35 s, and 212 s, respectively. Its high brightness (with isotropic peak luminosity L_ p, iso∼ 4 × 10 ^ 53 erg/s) allows us to conduct detailed time-resolved spectral analysis in each episode, from precursor to main burst and to extended emission. The spectral properties of the first two <b>sub-bursts</b> are distinctly different, allowing us to observe the transition from thermal to non-thermal radiation between well-separated emission episodes within a single GRB. Such a transition is a clear indication of the change of jet composition from a fireball to a Poynting-flux-dominated jet.

During this period, a transient accretion disk is formed and a strong transient magnetic field ∼ 2. 4 × 10 ^ 9 M_ 6 ^- 1 / 2 Gauss, lasting for r_ms/c∼ 30 M_ 6 s, may be produced in the inner boundary of the accretion disk. A large amount of rotational energy of the black hole is extracted and released in the ultra relativistic jet with a bulk Lorentz factor Γ larger than 10 ^ 3 via Blandford-Znajek process.

Focusing on large two- ribbon eruptive flares as representative of most large flares, we envision the reconnection events to be the driven reconnection of oppositely directed elementary flux tubes pressing into the flare-length current-sheet interface that forms {{in the wake of the}} eruption of the sheared core of the preflare bipolar field configuration. We point out that, because the outflows from these driven reconnection events have speeds of order the Alfven speed and because the magnetic field reduces the shear viscosity of the plasma, it is reasonable that the outflows are unstable and turbulent, so that the kinetic energy of an outflow is rapidly dissipated through turbulent cascade. If the largest eddies in the turbulence have diameters of order the expected widths of the outflows (10 (exp 7) - 10 (exp 8) cm), then the cascade dissipation of each of these eddies could produce approximately 10 (exp 26) erg burst of energized electrons (approximately 3 x (10 (exp 33) 25 keV electrons) in approximately 0. 3 s, which agrees well with hard X-ray and radio <b>sub-bursts</b> commonly observed during the impulsive phase. Of order 10 (exp 2) simultaneous reconnection events with turbulent outflow would produce the observed rate of impulsive-phase plasma energization in the most powerful flares (approximately 10 (exp 36) 25 keV electrons/ s); this number of reconnection sites can easily fit within the estimated 3 x 10 (exp 9) cm span of the overall current-sheet dissipation region formed in these large flares. We therefore conclude that MHD turbulent cascade is a promising mechanism for the plasma energization observed in the impulsive phase of solar flares...|$|R
