5|$|Cushing's {{syndrome}} is {{the manifestation of}} glucocorticoid excess. It can {{be the result of}} a prolonged treatment with glucocorticoids or be caused by an underlying disease which produces alterations in the HPA axis or the production of cortisol. Causes can be further classified into ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent. The most common cause of endogenous Cushing's {{syndrome is}} a pituitary adenoma which causes an excessive production of ACTH. The disease produces a wide variety of signs and symptoms which include obesity, diabetes, increased blood pressure, excessive body hair (hirsutism), osteoporosis, depression and, most distinctively, <b>stretch</b> <b>marks</b> in the skin, caused by its progressive thinning.|$|E

50|$|PG {{often is}} {{confused}} with pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP), {{especially if it}} occurs in a first pregnancy. PUPPP typically begins in <b>stretch</b> <b>mark</b> areas of the abdomen and usually ends within two weeks after delivery. PUPPP is not an autoimmune disease.|$|R
25|$|As {{subcutaneous}} fat accumulates, dimpling, or cellulite, becomes more apparent on the thighs and buttocks. <b>Stretch</b> <b>marks</b> (striae distensae) may {{appear on the}} skin in these areas. Susceptibility to sunburn increases, possibly because the skin is thinner and less pigmented.|$|E
25|$|<b>Stretch</b> <b>marks</b> (technically called striae) {{are also}} a form of scarring. These are caused when the skin is {{stretched}} rapidly (for instance during pregnancy, significant weight gain, or adolescent growth spurts), or when skin is put under tension during the healing process, (usually near joints). This type of scar usually improves in appearance after a few years.|$|E
25|$|Microcurrent {{treatments}} (MENS) {{have been}} around since the 1970s in medical applications and are distinguished by their use of micro-ampere currents (i.e. millionths of an amp) which are hardly perceptible, but mimic the body's own bio-electric currents. The treatment is designed to soften wrinkles and rejuvenate skin, including skin damaged by sunburn, acne, <b>stretch</b> <b>marks,</b> cellulite and scarring.|$|E

25|$|In 1953, Silver City {{also took}} {{delivery}} {{of its first}} <b>stretched</b> <b>Mark</b> 32 Bristol Superfreighter, the first of six. The Superfreighter's elongated nose enabled it to accommodate three cars or to be fitted with 60 seats in an all-passenger Super Wayfarer configuration. The new Superfreighters joined a fleet of nine standard Mark 21 Freighters. Other freight charter work at this time included flights to the Suez Canal Zone supporting the UK military forces then stationed there.|$|R
25|$|During pregnancy, {{the breasts}} become {{enlarged}} and denser (firmer) {{because of the}} prolactin-caused organ hypertrophy. This begins the production of breast milk, increases {{the size of the}} nipples, and darkens the skin color of the nipple-areola complex. These changes continue during the lactation and breastfeeding periods. Afterwards, the breasts generally revert to their pre-pregnancy size, shape, and volume, but might show <b>stretch</b> <b>marks.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cushing's {{syndrome}} {{is a collection}} of signs and symptoms due to prolonged exposure to cortisol. Signs and symptoms may include high blood pressure, abdominal obesity but with thin arms and legs, reddish <b>stretch</b> <b>marks,</b> a round red face, a fat lump between the shoulders, weak muscles, weak bones, acne, and fragile skin that heals poorly. Women may have more hair and irregular menstruation. Occasionally there may be changes in mood, headaches, and a chronic feeling of tiredness.|$|E
25|$|At menopause, breast atrophy occurs. The breasts can {{decrease}} in size when {{the levels of}} circulating estrogen decline. The adipose tissue and milk glands also begin to wither. The breasts can also become enlarged from adverse side effects of combined oral contraceptive pills. The size of the breasts can also increase and {{decrease in}} response to weight fluctuations. Physical changes to the breasts are often are recorded in the <b>stretch</b> <b>marks</b> of the skin envelope; they can serve as historical indicators of the increments and the decrements of the size and volume of a woman's breasts {{throughout the course of}} her life.|$|E

50|$|Yoke’s most {{interesting}} topographic feature is Rainsborrow Crag on the Kentmere {{side of the}} fell. This is a 300-metre precipice which falls away to the valley floor; the crags have attracted top rock climbers. The little known Rainsborrow Tarn stands {{on the edge of}} the crags. It is possible that the Roman road between Ambleside and Penrith came over the slopes of Yoke: old maps have shown short <b>stretches</b> <b>marked</b> “roman road” on the fell.

25|$|All {{scarring}} {{is composed}} of the same collagen as the tissue it has replaced, but {{the composition of the}} scar tissue, compared to the normal tissue, is different. Scar tissue also lacks elasticity unlike normal tissue which distributes fiber elasticity. Scars differ in the amounts of collagen overexpressed. Labels have been applied to the differences in overexpression. Two of the most common types are hypertrophic and keloid scarring, both of which experience excessive stiff collagen bundled growth overextending the tissue, blocking off regeneration of tissues. Another form is atrophic scarring (sunken scarring), which also has an overexpression of collagen blocking regeneration. This scar type is sunken, because the collagen bundles do not overextend the tissue. <b>Stretch</b> <b>marks</b> (striae) are regarded as scars by some.|$|E

2500|$|Episode three: Amanda and Jozef - This couple {{met when}} Amanda was just fourteen. They have since become {{the parents of}} two {{children}} and feel unhappy in their relationship. Jozef dresses like a teenager, priding himself with ripped jeans and hoodies. He is a landscape gardener and feels that he has lost important contracts {{as a result of}} his shabby clothing. Meanwhile, Amanda, through lack of confidence, dresses in clothes that hide her figure. Amanda's <b>stretch</b> <b>marks</b> also contribute to her lack of self-esteem. Pressure is also added to the relationship as Amanda is increasingly jealous of other woman, and even feels wary of Woodall and Josef going shopping on their own. Amanda and Jozef both feel deeply unhappy with their appearance and style and want to restore confidence through clothing. The couple are soon to face The Naked Truth behind the silhouette screen, which reveals that Jozef does not think Amanda really loves him. Undressing behind the screen helps the couple to become more confident with each other. Woodall and Constantine take them both shopping in London the next day, where Constantine dresses Jozef to look casual without being scruffy. Outfits include a jacket and well-cut jeans and a single breasted, one-button suit with slim-fitting trousers, while Woodall dresses Amanda to become sexier and more trendy. The couple's appearances are revealed at a luxury hotel. After they have been re-united, Jozef proposes to Amanda who says [...] "yes".|$|E

50|$|In September 1917 Armstrong, Whitworth & Co. in Newcastle-upon-Tyne began {{constructing}} two prototypes of a pure {{transport vehicle}} {{that would become}} the Mark IX, which could {{also serve as a}} supply tank. The prototypes were approved the following year, {{at a time when it}} had become clear that a possible alternative, the <b>stretched</b> <b>Mark</b> V* tank, was unsuited for infantry transport. Two hundred Mark IXs were ordered from the tractor manufacturer Marshall, Sons & Co. of Gainsborough, Lincolnshire but by the end of the Great War only three had been finished, out of a total ultimate production run of thirty-four. A specially-designed sledge developed by the tank workshop in France, that allowed an additional 10 LT of stores to be hauled, was tried.|$|R

In the case of medication, the Clinic points to [...] "Corticosteroid creams, lotions and pills and chronic use of oral or systemic steroids" [...] as a common contributing factor; in the case of medical conditions that can contribute to <b>stretch</b> <b>marks,</b> examples given include Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Cushing's syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and [...] "adrenal gland diseases".|$|E

30|$|A {{comparative}} study of the VES curve in Fig.  6 shows that VES- 13 represents a KH type of curve, {{while the rest of}} the curves further south along the traverse show a predominantly HA type of trend. A sudden change in the shape of the resistivity curve (VES- 13) probably indicates some structural control. EPF crossing is the traverse somewhere between VES- 14 and VES- 15 according to (Sahu et al. 2010), but the exact location of EPF may be a little north, near VES- 13 (Fig.  1 d). A change in the shape of the VES between GopalpurMathai and Sewanat Halt may be due the fact that EPF crosses the traverse between these two places. The coarse sand bed also pinches out in between the <b>stretch</b> <b>marked</b> by VES- 13 and VES- 14, revealing that the older course of Sone river is controlled by the tectonic activity of the region (Sahu et al. 2010) and further south from VES- 13 older alluvium of Pleistocene age is exposed.|$|R
60|$|I {{pressed the}} rough soldier's horny hand, and descended into the fishing-boat. The rope that held us was cast off, the sail mounted up, {{and the boat}} shot out across the bay. Onward she went and on, through the {{gathering}} gloom--a gloom as dark and impenetrable as the future towards which my life's bark was driving. Soon the long rise and fall told us that we were over the harbour bar and {{out in the open}} channel. On the land, scattered twinkling lights at long <b>stretches</b> <b>marked</b> the line of the coast. As I gazed backwards a cloud trailed off from the moon, and I saw the hard lines of the brig's rigging stand out against the white cold disk. By the shrouds stood the veteran, holding to a rope with one hand, and waving the other in farewell and encouragement. Another groat cloud blurred out the light, and that lean sinewy figure with its long extended arm was the last which I saw for a weary time of the dear country where I was born and bred.|$|R
