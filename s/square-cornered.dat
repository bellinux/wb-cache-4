60|$|And {{being a very}} clear-cutting {{personality}} with {{an instinct}} for the material rendering of things, she also came and sat {{beside him on the}} little <b>square-cornered</b> sofa.|$|E
60|$|Even {{when the}} sun came out, and the land was brazenly optimistic, she saw more than just prosperity. In a new home, house and barn and {{windmill}} <b>square-cornered</b> and prosaic, plumped down in a field with wheat coming up to the unporticoed door, a habitation unshadowed, unsheltered, unsoftened, she found a frank cleanness, as though the inhabitants looked squarely out at life, unafraid. She felt that the keen winds ought to blow away from such a prairie-fronting post of civilization all mildew and cowardice, all the mummy dust of ancient fears.|$|E
50|$|The Wright Crusader was {{introduced}} in 1995, replacing the Wright Handybus. Early Crusaders have tall, <b>square-cornered</b> or gasket side windows and a shallow roofline, similar to their predecessor. Most {{of them had a}} double-curvature windscreen with arched top as common.|$|E
50|$|This {{distinctive}} {{style of}} bodywork has a downward-sloping front window bay {{on the upper}} deck, with both top and bottom edges angled downwards. The side windows are <b>square-cornered.</b> A large double-curvature upper deck windscreen (either single-piece or two-piece) {{is one of the}} most distinctive features.|$|E
50|$|The full chisel chain has <b>square-cornered</b> teeth, {{splitting}} wood fibers {{easily in}} the cut for fast, efficient cutting in clean softwood. Chisel chains have a high kick-back risk due to missing safety chain elements and are more sensitive against dirt. These chains are available for semi-pro (also called pro-sumer) and professional saws.|$|E
5000|$|In 1940 an {{interesting}} straight-eight Daimler limousine emerged from Lacland Place, the curves replaced by razor edges. The Daimler {{had been given}} <b>square-cornered</b> windows, a flat waistline and a raked but square-edged tail. It was greeted as [...] "very very handsome, in a totally new idiom" [...] {{but there was a}} war on.|$|E
50|$|There {{was some}} {{variability}} in the height {{and shape of the}} side windows, and the style of windscreen. One common design of windscreen was <b>square-cornered,</b> tapered in towards the top and curved around to the sides. Another was a two-piece flat windscreen with radiused outer corners. A third design used was a double-curvature windscreen with an arched top.|$|E
5000|$|The Paramount had squarer lines {{than its}} {{predecessor}} the Supreme, with cleaner lines, a flatter roof line and <b>square-cornered</b> side windows including a small [...] "feature window" [...] just behind the front wheelarch. Forward of this, the window line sloped downwards to meet the deeper windscreen. The rear was similar to Supreme V and VI but all else was new.|$|E
50|$|The stadium, {{which cost}} {{approximately}} $740,000 to build, was located {{down the hill}} from Woodburn Hall, and bordered by Campus Drive to the north, University Avenue to the east, Woodburn and Chitwood Halls to the south, and eventually Beechurst Avenue on the west. It was built into the natural valley of the area, and was a <b>square-cornered</b> horseshoe initially opening to the west before becoming an enclosed structure.|$|E
50|$|The {{next major}} changes came in 1987, with the {{discount}} structure, types of discounted tickets available and {{appearance of the}} Railcard all changing. With {{the introduction of the}} APTIS ticket issuing system happening at this time, a new set of ticket stock (with the British Rail form number BR 4599/20) was introduced.

5000|$|The Verde has an {{aluminium}} structure, {{which is}} related {{to that of the}} smaller Pointer. The flat-sided, boxy shape is also {{similar to that of the}} Pointer, except for the front end, which has a [...] "barrel-curvature" [...] windscreen plus quarterlights with an arched top.On early vehicles (primarily the Scania N113s and DAF SB220s), the side windows have rounded corners and the quarterlights are deeper than the windscreen. Later built vehicles have <b>square-cornered</b> windows, an enlarged cab side window with an angled corner like that on the Pointer, and quarterlights which finish level with the windscreen. Minor alterations were also made to the front dash panel.|$|E
5000|$|While eleven forts {{were built}} {{during the reign}} of Senusret III in the region between the 2nd and 3rd cataracts, {{including}} Shalfak, Uronarti, Askut, Semna, Kumma, and Sumna South, Mirgissa was the largest of them.The great fortress covered more than [...] Its double wall with bastions and <b>square-cornered</b> towers, 12 m high, protected the city. The walls were more than 6 m thick and over 10 m high. Both entrances were protected by a ditch. The south side, facing the Nile, was protected by a fortified wall, which perfectly fit the rocky peaks on which it was underpinned. Two enormous gates were flanked to the north and near the southeast corner of the river. The north gate had a narrow passage, its access blocked by two massive wooden doors and a portcullis. Angled bedding-planes enabled the uphill brickwork. Excavations revealed a small temple dedicated to the goddess Hathor and a stele mentioning this goddess as the mistress of Iken; this discovery enabled positive identification of the fortress.|$|E
5000|$|The Hall is lighted by a {{range of}} large <b>square-cornered</b> windows along its left side, at a height of {{fourteen}} or fifteen feet from the ground, and also by sliding windows in the top, which serve besides as ventilators. The roof is very lofty and handsomely ornamented, and in the centre is a large square elevation, around which are placed the ventilating windows, which open or shut from the leads outside. [...] The Lower Hall has no such advantage, and is ventilated by the ordinary windows, placed {{on each side of}} the room; one range opening into the back street, and the other into the main cross-passage of the building. It is similar to the larger Hall, excepting that it has no raised seats and the gallery, platform, &c., are all on a smaller scale, suited to the size of the apartment. [...] A gallery extends round that part of the first floor which is not occupied by the Upper Hall, from which open the offices of the Jews (A reference to the London Society for Promoting Christianity Amongst the Jews, a Jewish Christian missionary society now known as the Church's Ministry Among Jewish People or CMJ), District Visiting, Hibernian, European Missionary, and other societies. Stairs from thence lead to the gallery of the lesser Hall, the raised seats of the large Hall, to its side-doors, (beneath the platform), to the platform itself, and to the sunk galleries. [...] These numerous staircases and passages render the back part of the building somewhat intricate; and strangers are constantly losing their way among them. When any large meeting is held, door-keepers, policemen, and other persons are stationed at the various stairs, to receive the tickets, and direct the company to their different destinations. [...] Notwithstanding this, confusion often arises when, both Halls are occupied at once, which is constantly the case during the early part of May. Another inconvenience attending such occasions is, that the plaudits of the upper and larger audience frequently drown the voices of those who are addressing the smaller one below; as they are situated immediately under the right side of the large Hall. Should the applause over-head not be very loud, it seems to arise from the lower Room, and many an inexperienced speaker has paused for his hearers to cease their cheers, when in reality the noise came from above, and had no reference to him whatever, but was addressed to some orator up stairs, perhaps expressing opinions diametrically opposed to his own… ...|$|E
40|$|We {{test the}} {{implicit}} prediction {{of a recent}} classical model that transport anomalies in ballistic multiprobe conductors—the last plateau, quenching, and the negative bend resistance—should scale with Fermi momentum, pF. Data from junctions defined by adiabatic lateral potentials (having corners with radii of curvature rJ>ħ/pF) qualitatively scale classically; departures observed are attributed to momentum-memory loss from random scattering. With more abrupt (<b>square-cornered)</b> junctions, however, nonclassical pF dependence emerges...|$|E
40|$|A {{box-shaped}} {{ground vehicle}} {{was used to}} simulate the aerodynamic drag of high volume transports, that is, delivery vans, trucks, or motor homes. The coast-down technique was used to define the drag of the original vehicle, having all square corners, and several modifications of the vehicle. Test velocities ranged up to 65 miles per hour, which provided maximum Reynolds numbers of 1 times 10 to the 7 th power based on vehicle length. One combination of modifications produced a reduction in aerodynamic drag of 61 percent {{as compared with the}} original <b>square-cornered</b> vehicle...|$|E
40|$|A {{standard}} two-axle {{truck with}} a box-shaped cargo compartment was tested to determine whether significant reductions in aerodynamic drag could be obtained by modifying {{the front of the}} cargo compartment. The coastdown method was used to determine the total drag of the baseline vehicle, which had a <b>square-cornered</b> cargo box, and of several modified configurations. Test velocities ranged from 56. 3 to 94. 6 kilometers per hour (35 to 60 miles per hour). At 88. 5 kilometers per hour (55 miles per hour), the aerodynamic drag reductions obtained with the modified configurations ranged from 8 to 30 percent...|$|E
40|$|NIOSH {{researchers}} {{have identified a}} pattern of fracture zone development that suggests an explanation for fracture formation around rectangular openings in underground mines. This pattern is characterized by shearing and dilation that result in either faults or in the repeated formation and propagation of en echelon fractures from sites of tension. Two computer modeling codes, Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua (FLAC) and Particle Flow Code (PFC), were used to model different aspects of this pattern. Use of very small elements with FLAC enabled the identification of sites of initial tension near the skin of <b>square-cornered</b> rectangular openings, while PFC allowed the initiation and progressive development of fractures from these sites to be followed as the fractures evolved. Such studies {{can lead to a}} greater understanding of how roof support can be better selected and installed for specific conditions in underground mines prone to roof falls and rock bursts. These studies may also lead to modifications of corner and opening shapes that could be incorporated into mine designs to produce more stable mine openings and reduce the risks of rock falls and rock bursts...|$|E
40|$|A new {{approach}} to the assessment and optimization of geometric stress-concentrating features is proposed {{on the basis of}} the correspondence between sharp crack or corner stressfield intensity factors and conventional elastic stress concentration factors (SCFs) for radiused transitions. This approach complements the application of finite element analysis (FEA) and the use of standard SCF data from the literature. The method makes it possible to develop closed-form solutions for SCFs in cases where corresponding solutions for the sharp crack geometries exist. This is helpful in the context of design optimization. The analytical basis of the correspondence is shown, together with the limits on applicability where stress-free boundaries near the stress concentrating feature are present or adjacent features interact. Examples are given which compare parametric results derived from FEA with closed-form solutions based on the proposed method. New information is given on the stress state at a 90 ° corner or width step, where the magnitude of the stress field intensity is related to that of the corresponding crack geometry. This correspondence enables the user to extend further the application of crack-tip stress-field intensity information to <b>square-cornered</b> steps, external U-grooves, and internal cut-outs...|$|E
