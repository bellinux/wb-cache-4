40|$|In the {{construction}} of low-rank matrix approximation and maximum element search it is effective to use maxvol algorithm. Nevertheless, even {{in the case of}} rank 1 approximation the algorithm does not always converge to the maximum matrix element, and it is unclear how often close to the maximum element can be found. In this article it is shown that with a certain degree of randomness in the matrix and proper selection of the <b>starting</b> <b>column,</b> the algorithm with high probability in a few steps converges to an element, which module differs little from the maximum. It is also shown that with more severe restrictions on the error matrix no restrictions on the <b>starting</b> <b>column</b> need to be introduced...|$|R

50|$|MPS is column-oriented (as {{opposed to}} {{entering}} the model as equations), and all model components (variables, rows, etc.) receive names. MPS {{is an old}} format, so it is set up for punch cards: Fields <b>start</b> in <b>column</b> 2, 5, 15, 25, 40 and 50. Sections of an MPS file are marked by so-called header cards, which are distinguished by their <b>starting</b> in <b>column</b> 1. Although it is typical to use upper-case throughout the file for historical reasons, many MPS-readers will accept mixed-case for anything except the header cards, and some allow mixed-case anywhere. The names that you choose for the individual entities (constraints or variables) are not important to the solver; one should pick meaningful names, or easy names for a post-processing code to read.|$|R

30|$|Helium {{was used}} as the carrier gas, and the <b>starting</b> <b>column</b> {{temperature}} was set at 50  °C, stopped for 1  min which was increased to 125  °C at 25  °C/min, followed by additional increment to 300  °C at 10  °C/min, and detained for 15  min. Injection temperature was 250  °C, injection mode was split, gas flow in the column was 1.7  ml/min, and analytical column DB- 5 ms was used. MS conditions are as follows: Ion source temperature was fixed at 200  °C and interface temperature was 280  °C, solvent cut time was 3  min, and detector gain mode was relative. The sample preparation procedure resulted in the derivatization of organic acids, and the concentrations of citric acid trimethylester, succinic acid dimethyester, fumaric acid dimethyester, and malic acid dimethyester were determined by using standard curves.|$|R
