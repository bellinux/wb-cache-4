5|$|Although Purkinje {{fibers and}} {{the bundle of}} His were {{discovered}} {{as early as the}} 19th century, their <b>specific</b> <b>role</b> in the electrical conduction system of the heart remained unknown until Sunao Tawara published his monograph, titled Das Reizleitungssystem des Säugetierherzens, in 1906. Tawara's discovery of the atrioventricular node prompted Arthur Keith and Martin Flack to look for similar structures in the heart, leading to their discovery of the sinoatrial node several months later. These structures form the anatomical basis of the electrocardiogram, whose inventor, Willem Einthoven, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology in 1924.|$|E
5|$|Genes are {{regulated}} {{so that they}} are expressed only when the product is needed, since expression draws on limited resources. A cell regulates its gene expression depending on its external environment (e.g. available nutrients, temperature and other stresses), its internal environment (e.g. cell division cycle, metabolism, infection status), and its <b>specific</b> <b>role</b> if in a multicellular organism. Gene expression can be regulated at any step: from transcriptional initiation, to RNA processing, to post-translational modification of the protein. The regulation of lactose metabolism genes in E. coli (lac operon) was the first such mechanism to be described in 1961.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these universal functions, the plasma membrane has a more <b>specific</b> <b>role</b> in multicellular organisms. Glycoproteins on the membrane assist the cell in recognizing other cells, in order to exchange metabolites and form tissues. Other proteins on the plasma membrane allow attachment to the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix; a function that maintains cell shape and fixes the location of membrane proteins. Enzymes that catalyze reactions are also found on the plasma membrane. Receptor proteins on the membrane have a shape that matches with a chemical messenger, resulting in various cellular responses.|$|E

25|$|In nature, DNA {{can form}} three structures, A-, B-, and Z-DNA. A- and B-DNA are very similar, forming {{right-handed}} helices, whereas Z-DNA is a left-handed helix with a zig-zag phosphate backbone. Z-DNA {{is thought to}} play a <b>specific</b> <b>role</b> in chromatin structure and transcription because of {{the properties of the}} junction between B- and Z-DNA.|$|E
25|$|Galectin-8 {{has been}} shown to play a <b>specific</b> <b>role</b> in {{assessing}} endosomal integrity. After pathogens, such as bacteria or viruses, are engulfed by cells, they typically try to exit the endosome to gain access to nutrients in the cytosol. Galectin-8 specifically binds to glycosylation found within the endosome, and recruits adapter machinery CALCOCO2 which activates antibacterial autophagy.|$|E

The class are primarily used with the Fishery Protection Squadron and EEZ patrol.|$|E
25|$|No. 201 Flight {{was formed}} at RAAF Station Laverton on 10 March 1945 as radio and radar {{experimentation}} unit. Its <b>specific</b> <b>role</b> {{was to use}} modified B-24 Liberator heavy bombers to determine the characteristics of Japanese radar stations {{so that they could}} be effectively attacked by Allied aircraft. These tasks were considered to be highly important and secret by the RAAF, and few people outside of No. 201 Flight knew that the unit existed. In order to further protect secrecy the flight's personnel were not briefed on the purpose of the unit and its aircraft beyond their individual responsibilities.|$|E

25|$|The {{failure of}} many private {{universities}} and other {{higher education institutions}} in providing higher education to students due to generalized lack of quality and rigour {{has also been a}} major problem - for several years those institutions were awarding degrees to thousands of people who were spread into the economically active population. Some higher education institutions, in particular from the private and polytechnic sector, have been regarded as true diploma mills. In the following decades after their creation in the 1970s and 1980s, the polytechnic institutions didn't assume their <b>specific</b> <b>role</b> as tertiary education vocational schools, which were created to award practical diplomas in more technical or basic fields.|$|E
25|$|In a team, {{each member}} has a subgoal {{pertinent}} to his/her <b>specific</b> <b>role</b> that feeds into the overall team goal. Associated with each member's subgoal are {{a set of}} SA elements about which he/she is concerned. Team SA, therefore, can be represented as shown in Figure 2. As {{the members of a}} team are essentially interdependent in meeting the overall team goal, some overlap between each member's subgoal and their SA requirements will be present. It is this subset of information that constitutes much of team coordination. That coordination may occur as a verbal exchange, a duplication of displayed information, or by some other means.|$|E
25|$|The {{region of}} modern-day Croatia may {{have served as}} a {{refugium}} for the northern populations during the last glacial maximum (LGM). The eastern Adriatic coast was much further south. The northern and the western parts of that sea were steppes and plains, while the modern Croatian islands (rich in Paleolithic archeological sites) were hills and mountains. The region had a <b>specific</b> <b>role</b> in the structuring of European, and particularly among Slavic, paternal genetic heritage, characterized by the predominance of R1a and I, and scarcity of E lineages. However, DNA can not be completely connected and used as the evidence for a specific ethnic component, but only as an indication.|$|E

25|$|Several other {{roles were}} {{proposed}} for Bok, especially in developing cells. Since {{the action of}} Bok in triggering apoptosis seems to be redundant, {{it is difficult to}} assign a <b>specific</b> <b>role</b> to Bok in the presence of Bak and Bax. The study of cells deficient in Bak and Bok or deficient in Bax and Bok, respectively, could help to better characterize the role of Bok in apoptosis. If Bok exerts a critical function, it is likely that this function is limited to certain circumstances, e.g. specific cell types, stress conditions. Thus, these aspects should be assessed in more detail to analyze the physiological and pathological role of Bok.|$|E
25|$|An {{immunization}} {{survey of}} human serum samples suggests {{that exposure to}} glutamyl endopeptidase is common, although a correlation to any specific type of infection could not be established. The numerous targets of bacterial proteases, adding the complexity of other virulence factors and their genetic regulation, {{makes it difficult to}} attribute a <b>specific</b> <b>role</b> of the protease for the bacteria. In vivo trials with S. aureus with inactivaion of ssp or sspA controlling glutamyl endopeptidase gives a contradictory picture for its importance, although it has shown impact for bacterial survival in human whole blood. It has been suggested, however, that the protease promotes S. aureus dissemination through cleavage of self-proteins and through kinin-induced vasodilation, simultaneously protecting against immunological responses, i.e. through corruption of the regulation of the complement system and of neutrophil-derived proteases.|$|E
25|$|Copper {{released}} from intestinal cells {{moves to the}} serosal (i.e., thin membrane lining) capillaries where it binds to albumin, glutathione, and amino acids in the portal blood. There is also evidence for a small protein, transcuprein, with a <b>specific</b> <b>role</b> in plasma copper transport Several {{or all of these}} copper-binding molecules may participate in serum copper transport. Copper from portal circulation is primarily taken up by the liver. Once in the liver, copper is either incorporated into copper-requiring proteins, which are subsequently secreted into the blood. Most of the copper (70 – 95%) excreted by the liver is incorporated into ceruloplasmin, the main copper carrier in blood. Copper is transported to extra-hepatic tissues by ceruloplasmin, albumin and amino acids, or excreted into the bile. By regulating copper release, the liver exerts homeostatic control over extrahepatic copper.|$|E
