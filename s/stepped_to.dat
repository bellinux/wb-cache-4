5|$|McBride {{made his}} major league debut for the Cardinals in 1973, but he {{retained}} his rookie status after only appearing in 40 games that year. He became {{known for a}} distinctive appearance, as he wore {{one of the largest}} Afro hairstyles in the major leagues. When he <b>stepped</b> <b>to</b> home plate to bat, McBride made a ritual of wiping away the chalk lines that made up the batter's box. He used an unconventional batting stance, placing his weight on his front foot rather than on his back foot.|$|E
5|$|The Yankee {{opponent}} in the 1951 World Series was the Giants, with Game 1 played the day after they won the National League pennant in the Miracle of Coogan's Bluff. On an emotional high, the Giants beat the Yankees in Game 1 at Yankee Stadium. Game 2 was a Yankee victory, but Mantle suffered a knee injury and was out for the Series, the start of knee problems that would darken Mantle's career. The Giants won Game 3, but DiMaggio <b>stepped</b> <b>to</b> the fore, with six hits in the following three games, including a home run to crown his career. The Yankees won Games 4 and 5, and staked Raschi to a 4–1 lead in Game 6 before Stengel had Johnny Sain pitch in relief. When Sain loaded the bases with none out in the ninth, Stengel brought in Bob Kuzava, a left hander, to pitch against the Giants, even though right handers Monte Irvin and Bobby Thomson were due to bat. The Giants scored twice, but Kuzava hung on. The Yankees and Stengel had their third straight World Series championship.|$|E

25|$|Kazmir {{was named}} to the American League squad for the 2008 MLB All-Star Game. Though the Rays' {{management}} preferred that Kazmir rest his arm and not pitch in the mid-summer classic if at all possible, the game ended up being the longest ever and Kazmir <b>stepped</b> <b>to</b> the mound in the 15th inning. He threw a scoreless frame and the AL all-stars scored the winning run {{in the bottom of the}} 15th, making Kazmir the winning pitcher.|$|E

Many expected the same to occur in Jersey City. But Sandel had played against Robinson, also a Californian, in baseball games {{on the west coast}} and harbored no ill feelings toward him. After the first several pitches were thrown and the count ran to 2-1, Dick Bouknight, the Giants catcher, walked to the mound and demanded to know if Sandell was going to throw at Robinson. Sandel refused. After running up a 3-2 count, Robinson ground out harmlessly to the shortstop.|$|E

Arkansas scored four runs {{in the eighth inning}} of game one, leading to a 9–8 victory. Game two also ended in a Razorback comeback. The Hogs, down 3–0 in the seventh inning, got a big hit from pinch hitter Thomas Hauskey. The senior catcher <b>stepped</b> <b>to</b> the plate with a runner on second base and two outs {{in the bottom of the}} ninth, and {{delivered}} a clutch RBI single to win the game. Collin Kuhn, Zack Cox, Andy Wilkins and Brett Eibner each hit home runs in game three to give the Hogs a 10–5 win. The sweep was the first of Alabama since 2006.|$|E

Tyler Hansbrough struggled in the first half, but North Carolina's other players <b>stepped</b> <b>to</b> give the team a 14-point lead a halftime. In the second half, he led the team with 16 points, contributing to what was {{at one point in}} the half a 26-point lead. Third-seeded Louisville went on to face the Tar Heels in the East finals after defeating the second-seeded Tennessee Volunteers, 79-60. Earl Clark scored 17 points, 13 of them coming in the second half, and had 12 rebounds to lead the Cardinals. The Volunteers were held to 34% shooting and Louisville coach Rick Pitino improved to 8-0 in Regional semifinal games.|$|E
25|$|On Saturday, February 23, 1985 {{during a}} game at Bloomington between Purdue and Indiana, just five minutes into the game, a {{scramble}} for a loose ball resulted in a foul call on Indiana's Marty Simmons. Immediately after the resumption of play, a foul was called on Indiana's Daryl Thomas. Knight, irate, insisted {{the first of the}} two calls should have been for a jump ball and ultimately received a technical foul. Purdue's Steve Reid <b>stepped</b> <b>to</b> the free throw line to shoot the resulting free throws, but before he could, Knight grabbed a red plastic chair from Indiana's bench and threw it across the floor toward the basket in front of Reid. Knight was charged with second and third technical fouls and was ejected from the game. He apologized for his actions the next day and was given a one-game suspension and two years probation from the Big Ten. Since the incident, Knight has occasionally joked about throwing the chair by saying that he saw an old lady standing on the opposite sideline and threw her the chair so she could sit down.|$|E

500|$|The brief pause from {{politics}} out of national grief at Taylor's death did not abate the crisis. Texas {{had attempted to}} assert its authority in New Mexico territory, and the state's governor, Peter H. Bell, had sent belligerent letters to President Taylor. Fillmore received another such after becoming president. [...] He reinforced federal troops in the area, and warned Bell to keep the peace. By July 31, Clay's bill was effectively dead, as all the significant provisions had been deleted by amendment other than the organization of Utah Territory—one wag put it that the [...] "Mormons" [...] were the only remaining passengers on the Omnibus.

500|$|Jordan {{played in}} his final NBA game on April 16, 2003 in Philadelphia. After scoring only 13 points in the game, Jordan went to the bench with 4 minutes and 13 seconds {{remaining}} {{in the third quarter}} and with his team trailing the Philadelphia 76ers, 75–56. Just after the start of the fourth quarter, the First Union Center crowd began chanting [...] "We want Mike!" [...] After much encouragement from coach Doug Collins, Jordan finally rose from the bench and re-entered the game, replacing Larry Hughes with 2:35 remaining. At 1:45, Jordan was intentionally fouled by the 76ers' Eric Snow, and <b>stepped</b> <b>to</b> the line to make both free throws. After the second foul shot, the 76ers in-bounded the ball to rookie John Salmons, who in turn was intentionally fouled by Bobby Simmons one second later, stopping time so that Jordan could return to the bench. Jordan received a three-minute standing ovation from his teammates, his opponents, the officials, and the crowd of 21,257 fans.|$|E

Despite Adams' {{impressive}} opening performance, by the third day of the match, Sexton was far in the lead. In Dewey-Defeats-Truman-style, many newspapers reported that Sexton won the tournament, as their reporters left the venue at a time when Sexton had a seemingly indomitable lead and before the match was over. The New York Times, for example, reported that Sexton won the match, though they leavened the result by reporting that despite the prize fund, it was a [...] "friendly match", geared toward exhibition, and that [...] "Adams could undoubtedly have run the game out on three occasions, but preferred to make 'display' shots in place of his usual [...] "nurse" [...] play, against which a cue player stands no chance whatever."
