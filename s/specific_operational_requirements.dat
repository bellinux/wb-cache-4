40|$|This thesis reports an {{overview}} {{and the main}} results of the research activity carried out within the PhD programme in Information Engineering of the University of Pisa (2010 - 2012). The research activity {{has been focused on}} different fields, including Automotive and High Energy Physics experiments, according to a common denominator: the development of electroni c devices and systems operating in harsh environments. There are many applications that forc e the adoption of design methodologies and strategies focused on this type of envir onments: military, biom edical, automotive, industrial and space. The development of solutions fulfilling <b>specific</b> <b>operational</b> <b>requirements,</b> therefore represents an interesting field of research. The first research activity has been framed within the ATHENIS project, funded by the CORDIS Commission of the European Community, and aiming at the development of a System-on-Chip, a r egulator for alternators employed on vehicles, presenting both configurability an d the ability to work at the harshest operating conditions of the automotive industry. Specifically, a novel Intelligent Power Switch has been conceived, capable of driving different kind of loads, such as incandescent bulbs and LED, showing a high level of flexibility and adaptability to the most extreme operating conditions. Several features have been integrated, including current limitation, voltage regul ation, reverse polar ity and over-voltage capability, control of current slope, combi ned with strategies as over-current and over-temperature protection, that hav e required the design of an innovative architecture. The first test-chip, realized in AMS CMOS High Voltage 0, 35 μm technology, has been validated thanks {{to the development of a}} dedicated test-bed, which has allowed the deep characterization of the dev ice, proving its excellent performance. The second branch of research has been carried out within the FF-LYNX project, which has involved the section of Pisa of the National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN), the Department of Physics of the University of Calif ornia Santa Barbara (UCSB) and the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). The aim of this multidisciplinary project has been the def inition of a protocol for the distribution of Timing, Trigger and Control signals and for the readout in High Energy Physics experiments. In particular, the focus of t he activity has been the implementation of the protocol into Transmitter-Receiver in terfaces within the test-chip FF-TC 1, realized in IBM CMOS 130 nm technology. During this phase, novel radiation hardening techniques have been studied and implemented in order to ensure the proper functioning in operating environments with a high level of radiation, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva. Besides that, an emulator for functional validation of the FF-LYNX protocol has been developed, embedded on the XpressGXII PLDA board, equipped with PCI-Express to interface with a host PC.

40|$|Artificial {{magnetic}} materials (AMMs) are {{a type of}} metamaterials which are engineered to exhibit desirable magnetic properties not found in nature. AMMs are realized by embedding electrically small metallic resonators aligned in parallel planes in a host dielectric medium. In {{the presence of a}} magnetic field, an electric current is induced on the inclusions leading to the emergence of an enhanced magnetic response inside the medium at the resonance frequency of the inclusions. AMMs with negative permeability are used to develop single negative, or double negative metamaterials. AMMs with enhanced positive permeability are used to provide magneto-dielectric materials at microwave or optical frequencies where the natural {{magnetic materials}} fail to work efficiently. Artificial magnetic materials have proliferating applications in microwave and optical frequency region. Such applications include inversely refracting the light beam, invisibility cloaking, ultra miniaturizing and frequency bandwidth enhancing low profile antennas, planar superlensing, super-sensitive sensing, decoupling proximal high profile antennas, and enhancing solar cells efficiency, among others. AMMs have unique enabling features that allow for these important applications. Fundamental limitations on the performance of artificial magnetic materials have been derived. The first limitation which depends on the generic model of permeability functions expresses that the frequency dispersion in an AMM is limited by the desired operational bandwidth. The other constraints are derived based on the geometrical limitations of inclusions. These limitations are calculated based on a circuit model. Therefore, a formulation for permeability and magnetic susceptibility of the media based on a circuit model is developed. The formulation is in terms of a geometrical parameter that represents the geometrical characteristics of the inclusions such as area, perimeter and curvature, and a physical parameter that represents the physical, structural and fabrication characteristics of the medium. The effect of the newly introduced parameters on the effective permeability of the medium and the magnetic loss tangent are studied. In addition, the constraints and relations are used to methodically design artificial magnetic material meeting <b>specific</b> <b>operational</b> <b>requirements.</b> A novel design methodology based on an introduced analytical formulation for artificial magnetic material with desired properties is implemented. The synthesis methodology is performed in an iterative four-step algorithm. In the first step, the feasibility of the design is tested to meet the fundamental constraints. In consecutive steps, the geometrical and physical factors which are attributed to the area and perimeter of the inclusion are synthesized and calculated. An updated range of the inclusion's area and perimeter is obtained through consecutive iterations. Finally, the outcome of the iterative procedure is checked for geometrical realizability. The strategy behind the design methodology is generic and can be applied to any adopted circuit based model for AMMs. Several generic geometries are introduced to realize any combination of geometrically realizable area and perimeter (s,l) pairs. A realizable geometry is referred to a contour that satisfies Dido's inequality. The generic geometries introduced here can be used to fabricate feasible AMMs. The novel generic geometries not only can be used to enhance magnetic properties, but also they can be configured to provide specific permeability with desired dispersion function over a certain frequency bandwidth with a maximum magnetic loss tangent. The proposed generic geometries are parametric contours with uncorrelated perimeter and area function. Geometries are configured by tuning parameters in order to possess specified perimeter and surface area. The produced contour is considered as the inclusion's shape. The inclusions are accordingly termed Rose curve resonators (RCRs), Corrugated rectangular resonators (CRRs) and Sine oval resonators (SORs). Moreover, the detailed characteristics of the RCR are studied. The RCRs are used as complementary resonators in design of the ground plane in a microstrip stop-band filter, and as the substrate in design of a miniaturized patch antenna. The performance of new designs is compared with the counterpart devices, and the advantages are discussed...|$|E
