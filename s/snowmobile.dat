5|$|Sarah {{suggests}} that Hank and Jacob return a paltry {{sum of the}} money to the plane to avoid suspicion from local authorities. While travelling on foot to the woods, the brothers come across an old man on a <b>snowmobile.</b> Jacob, thinking that their cover is blown, bludgeons him. When the man regains consciousness, Hank suffocates him, then uses the <b>snowmobile</b> to drive his body off a bridge, making the murder look like an accidental death. The following night, Lou drunkenly demands some of the money from Hank, because he has spent recklessly since the discovery. When Hank refuses, Lou threatens to go to the authorities, having learned from Jacob about the old man's murder.|$|E
5|$|Burns talks Homer into {{cheating}} {{and they}} use a <b>snowmobile</b> to reach the cabin. Arriving early, they settle down in the comfortable surroundings and quickly become friends. While clinking their champagne glasses, they inadvertently cause an avalanche that buries the entire cabin. The two make several attempts at escaping but are unsuccessful. The other employees reach {{what appears to be}} their destination; however, it is actually a ranger station and they begin to realize that something bad has happened to their colleagues.|$|E
50|$|All modern <b>snowmobiles</b> are {{powered by}} either a four- or {{two-stroke}} internal combustion engine. Historically, <b>snowmobiles</b> have always used two-stroke engines {{because of their}} reduced complexity, weight and cost, compared to a similarly powered four-stroke. However, four-stroke powered <b>snowmobiles</b> have been gaining popularity steadily in the last fifteen or so years, with manufacturer Yamaha producing four-stroke <b>snowmobiles</b> only. The Whistler Blackcomb ski resort is testing electric <b>snowmobiles</b> with lower noise and shorter range, and similar vehicles exist.|$|R
5000|$|Older <b>snowmobiles</b> could {{generally}} accommodate two people; however, most <b>snowmobiles</b> {{manufactured in}} the last twenty-five years have been designed for a single rider. <b>Snowmobiles</b> built {{with the ability to}} carry two riders are referred to as [...] "2-up" [...] <b>snowmobiles</b> or 'touring' models and make up an extremely small share of the market. <b>Snowmobiles</b> do not have any enclosures, except for a windshield, and their engines normally drive a continuous track at the rear. Skis at the front provide directional control.|$|R

5|$|In various {{sections}} of the game, the player can ride a Triumph motorcycle, or a <b>snowmobile.</b> Other segments of the game involve boss fights. If the player chooses to be sneaky, they can overhear humorous conversations between non-player characters, such as guards, scientists and civilians. Occasionally, the player can engage in conversations with such characters. In certain cutscenes, the game uses a dialog tree, in which the player can choose between different questions and responses when talking to another character.|$|E
5|$|New York State Route421 (NY421) {{is a short}} {{state highway}} located within Adirondack Park in the southeastern corner of St. Lawrence County, New York, in the United States. It is a narrow, two-lane spur route {{connecting}} NY30 to Horseshoe Lake by way of Tupper Lake. A dead end sign is posted immediately off NY30, the only route with which it intersects. The entire road {{is located in the}} town of Piercefield, although that name is not posted on NY421. The route offers access to several picnic and <b>snowmobile</b> areas.|$|E
5|$|Stewie hitches a {{ride with}} a trucker and so Brian follows {{him all the way}} to Canada. On the way, Stewie accidentally causes a traffic pileup by {{discharging}} a flare pistol in the cab of the truck, which catches fire and explodes. Crashing his car in a chain reaction, Brian becomes angry and tells Stewie that Santa does not exist. Stewie becomes frustrated and continues to attempt to hitchhike, corecing Brian to join him. The pair then encounter a Canadian who gives them his <b>snowmobile.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Snowmobiles</b> {{are widely}} used in arctic territories for travel. However, the small Arctic {{population}} means a correspondingly small market. Most <b>snowmobiles</b> are sold for recreational purposes, in places where snow cover is stable during winter. The number of <b>snowmobiles</b> in Europe {{and other parts of}} the world is low, but growing.|$|R
50|$|Alpina <b>Snowmobiles</b> are {{manufactured}} in Vicenza, Italy, by Alpina s.r.l., {{a manufacturer of}} various on-snow implements that had been building dual-track <b>snowmobiles</b> since 1995.|$|R
5|$|An enthusiast of {{cars and}} fast driving from an early age, Villeneuve started his {{professional}} career in <b>snowmobile</b> racing in his native province of Quebec. He moved into single seaters, winning the US and Canadian Formula Atlantic championships in 1976, before being offered a drive in Formula One with the McLaren team at the 1977 British Grand Prix. He was taken on by reigning world champions Ferrari {{for the end of}} the season and from 1978 to his death in 1982 drove for the Italian team. He won six Grand Prix races in a short career at the highest level. In 1979, he finished second by four points in the championship to teammate Jody Scheckter.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, the town's {{farm was}} closed and {{replaced}} by industrial liquifying of powdered milk. The first serial-produced <b>snowmobile</b> was taken into use in 1961. By 1969, there were 140 registered snowmobiles and only 33 registered cars. From 1962 to 1984, a recreational centre was run at Sverdrupbyen. Ordinary operation in Mine 4 started in 1966 but was terminated by 1970, two years after Mine 2b closed. Operations in Mine 6 commenced in 1969. Television broadcasting equipment was installed in 1969, with the schedule of the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation being aired with a two-week delay.|$|E
5|$|As of 2010, {{the company}} had a revenue of NOK56 million, up NOK10 million from 2009, {{yielding}} a profit of NOK2 million. The company employed between 51 and 55 people, it is based at Håkons Hall and is entirely owned by Lillehammer Municipality. The company's revenue comes {{from a series of}} sources, the most important being events and tourists. At Lysgårdsbakken, the company operates a chairlift and viewing platform {{at the top of the}} tower, as well as a downhill and bobsleigh simulator. The company tailors events to companies with various activities at the hill, including a ceremony to light to Olympic Flame. Kanthaugen and its lift is rented out for tobogganing. The sledding track serves groups and tourists with activities such as wheelbob and for-man bobsleigh with an authorized pilot, bobrafting, skeleton and skeleton rafting. Next to the track is an activity park with activities such as <b>snowmobile</b> and all-terrain vehicle tracks.|$|E

50|$|<b>Snowmobiles</b> {{were also}} {{considered}} by many visitors to be destructive and noisy. Therefore, this Act prohibited the use of <b>snowmobiles</b> {{in all areas of}} the wilderness except for the following: the overland portages from Crane Lake to Little Vermilion Lake in Canada, and from Sea Gull River along the eastern portion of Saganaga Lake to Canada. <b>Snowmobiles</b> may be used on Vermilion Lake portage to and including Trout Lake, Moose Lake to and including Saganaga Lake via Ensign, Vera and Knife Lakes, and East Bearskin Lake to and including Pine Lake via Alder Lake and Canoe Lake until January 1, 1984. <b>Snowmobiles</b> must be less than 40 in in width.|$|R
50|$|Early <b>snowmobiles</b> used rubber tracks, but modern snowmobiles' {{tracks are}} {{typically}} {{made of a}} Kevlar composite. Originally, <b>snowmobiles</b> were powered by two-stroke gasoline internal combustion engines and since the mid-2000s four-stroke engines have also entered the market.|$|R
5|$|Continuing north, the {{trunkline}} {{passes through}} mixed agricultural and wood lands {{into the community}} of Lawton. M-40 follows Main Street through town and exits on a northwestern track towards the village of Paw Paw. M-40 crosses over I-94 and turns north into town running along Maple Lake. The highway crosses the narrow isthmus between the larger Maple Lake and the smaller Ackley Lake, passing through some small residential subdivisions as it leaves Paw Paw. Small farms dot the landscape as M-40 crosses M-43 {{in a rural area}} of the county on the way to Gobles. It is in this small city that the road crosses the Kal-Haven Trail State Park, a linear park that follows the former Kalamazoo and South Haven Railroad line. The rail line was converted into a rail trail and allows users to bike, hike or <b>snowmobile</b> between Kalamazoo and South Haven.|$|E
5|$|Entrance to {{national}} park is available by boat in Wijdefjorden from the north, or over land from Billefjorden and Dicksonfjorden from the south. During winter, {{the area is}} accessible from Longyearbyen, either by <b>snowmobile</b> or by ski. There are several older trapper cabins in the park, {{and some of these}} are lent to residents of Longyearbyen. Except for Einsteinvatnet, a lake with Arctic char, there are few destinations within the park, although the park {{can be used as a}} basis for other destinations. This includes trips to Perriertoppen, Svalbard's second-highest peak, and the glacier Åsgårdsfonna. Because of the shape of the park, there is little good hiking within the park, except for walking along the beaches on either side of the fjord. It is possible to see the entire national park from Mittag-Lefflerbreen, which can be hiked to from Pyramiden.|$|E
5|$|In April 2005, the City of Marquette {{agreed to}} {{exchange}} jurisdiction {{over a number}} of roadways with MDOT. These transfers placed Bus. US41 and the unsigned M-554 under city jurisdiction; at the same time, the state would take over a section of McClellan Avenue to extend M-553 to its current northern terminus at the Marquette Bypass. Negotiations regarding the transfer centered on MDOT deferring to city zoning ordinances along McClellan Avenue regarding driveway and <b>snowmobile</b> access and the city's assumption of expenses and liabilities related to the business loop. The transfers were made official on October 10, 2005, when MDOT and the city finalized the paperwork. As a result, Bus. US41 was decommissioned when the city took control over Washington and Front streets; signage was removed on November 9, 2005, to complete the process. Some local maps continue to label Bus. US41 through downtown Marquette, even years after the decommissioning of the designation, and some local businesses and organizations still use it in their advertising.|$|E
50|$|There is also {{an ongoing}} debate about the damages caused by <b>snowmobiles</b> and {{all-terrain}} vehicles in the parks. The <b>snowmobiles</b> have become increasingly popular and numerous, while global warming have made the terrain more vulnerable to the vehicles. Joyrides by visitors outside the marked trails have become a problem, especially for the Sami, since they claim that the disruptions made by <b>snowmobiles</b> may cause the pregnant female reindeer to drop their calves prematurely.|$|R
25|$|Snowmobiling: Registered <b>snowmobiles</b> {{may use the}} Big Poe Road in {{the park}} and {{surrounding}} state forest roads daily {{after the end of the}} rifle deer season in December. Most roads are joint-use roads shared by <b>snowmobiles</b> and motor vehicles.|$|R
50|$|Grousers {{have been}} used in such exotic environments as the deep sea floor, and the {{surfaces}} of the Moon and Mars. <b>Snowmobiles</b> once used cleated tracks, but racing <b>snowmobiles</b> are banned from using cleated track for safety reasons and instead use rubber tracks.|$|R
5|$|Modern winter service {{vehicles}} will usually {{also have a}} satellite navigation system connected to a weather forecast feed, allowing the driver to choose the best areas to treat and to avoid areas in which rain is likely, which can wash away the grit used—the most advanced can even adapt to changing conditions, ensuring optimal gritter and plow settings. Most run on wheels, often with snow chains or studded tires, but some are mounted on caterpillar tracks, with the tracks themselves adapted to throw the snow towards {{the side of the}} road. Off-road winter {{service vehicles}} mounted on caterpillar tracks are known as snowcats. Snowcats are commonly fitted with snowplows or snow groomers, and are used by ski resorts to smooth and maintain pistes and <b>snowmobile</b> runs, although they can also be used as a replacement for chairlifts.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of <b>snowmobile</b> racing, the yellow flag is {{displayed}} at or before {{the point of the}} hazard. When a <b>snowmobile</b> racer crosses the yellow flag, the race will continue, however, the skis and track of the <b>snowmobile</b> must remain on the ground.|$|E
25|$|<b>Snowmobiles</b> {{were widely}} used to deliver aid and provide transportation. Niagara Regional Police Service {{enlisted the help}} of 60 <b>snowmobiles</b> and 15 four-wheel drive {{vehicles}} for use for regular police calls, as well as to deliver food and medication. <b>Snowmobiles</b> were also used to transport doctors and nurses, and Ontario Hydro workers. In Fort Erie, <b>snowmobiles</b> were being dispatched from all six fire halls to provide aid. Citizens band (CB) radio operators were used by the Niagara Regional Police for communication. The radio station CHOW facilitated communication by allowing people to call in and air needs on the radio, a role confirmed via a plaque from the Port Colborne Chamber of Commerce and scrolls from the Welland Chamber of Commerce.|$|R
