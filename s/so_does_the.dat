5|$|As {{the number}} of {{cavities}} {{play a vital role}} in moulding costs, <b>so</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> complexity of the part's design. Complexity can be incorporated into many factors such as surface finishing, tolerance requirements, internal or external threads, fine detailing or {{the number of}} undercuts that may be incorporated.|$|E
5|$|Durkheim saw the {{population}} density and growth as key {{factors in the}} evolution of the societies and advent of modernity. As the number of people in a given area increase, <b>so</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> number of interactions, and the society becomes more complex. Growing competition between the more numerous people also leads to further division of labour. In time, the importance of the state, the law and the individual increases, while that of the religion and moral solidarity decreases.|$|E
5|$|The Oubangui {{people of}} west Africa plant a tree {{when a child}} is born. As the tree flourishes, <b>so</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> child but if the tree fails to thrive, the health of the child is {{considered}} at risk. When it flowers it is time for marriage. Gifts are left at the tree periodically and when the individual dies, their spirit is believed to live on in the tree.|$|E

5|$|Newly hatched New Guinea {{crocodiles}} feed on aquatic insects, spiders, tadpoles, freshwater snails, frogs, {{fish and}} small mammals. As they grow, <b>so</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> {{size of their}} prey and their consumption of fish rises, but they still will eat anything of a worthwhile size that they can find. An adult's diet is largely fish, caught by sweeping the snout sideways and snapping at the prey, but also includes shrimps, crabs, frogs, snakes, birds and medium-sized mammals. A crocodile catches its prey by stealth {{with a flick of}} its head, impaling it with its sharp teeth and gripping and crushing it. The jaws cannot move sideways to chew the food; instead, the crocodile's head is tossed to move the prey {{to the back of the}} mouth before the prey is swallowed whole. This crocodile is surprisingly agile and can lunge its body upward into the air to catch bats, flying birds, and leaping fish. It can also probe into the mud at the bottom of a river or swamp with its snout to search for crabs and molluscs.|$|E
5|$|The reactivities of the {{alkali metals}} {{increase}} {{going down the}} group. This {{is the result of}} a combination of two factors: the first ionisation energies and atomisation energies of the alkali metals. Because the first ionisation energy of the alkali metals decreases down the group, it is easier for the outermost electron to be removed from the atom and participate in chemical reactions, thus increasing reactivity down the group. The atomisation energy measures the strength of the metallic bond of an element, which falls down the group as the atoms increase in radius and thus the metallic bond must increase in length, making the delocalised electrons further away from the attraction of the nuclei of the heavier alkali metals. Adding the atomisation and first ionisation energies gives a quantity closely related to (but not equal to) the activation energy of the reaction of an alkali metal with another substance. This quantity decreases going down the group, and <b>so</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> activation energy; thus, chemical reactions can occur faster and the reactivity increases down the group.|$|E

25|$|In {{electromechanical}} regulators, {{voltage regulation}} is easily accomplished by coiling the sensing wire {{to make an}} electromagnet. The magnetic field produced by the current attracts a moving ferrous core held back under spring tension or gravitational pull. As voltage increases, <b>so</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> current, strengthening the magnetic field produced by the coil and pulling the core towards the field. The magnet is physically connected to a mechanical power switch, which opens as the magnet moves into the field. As voltage decreases, <b>so</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> current, releasing spring tension or {{the weight of the}} core and causing it to retract. This closes the switch and allows the power to flow once more.|$|E
25|$|Mandatory Swedish is {{supported}} by most political parties in Finland, like the National Coalition Party, the Centre Party, the Social Democrats and the Left Alliance. The Finns Party opposes mandatory Swedish, and <b>so</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> youth wing of the National Coalition Party.|$|E

60|$|There were ambassadors from Holland that day, to intercede for {{the unhappy}} King, whom you and I both wish the Parliament had spared; {{but they got}} no answer. The Scottish Commissioners interceded too; <b>so</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> Prince of Wales, by a letter in which he offered as the next heir to the throne, to accept any {{conditions}} from <b>the</b> Parliament; <b>so</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> Queen, by letter likewise.|$|R
25|$|The area {{reduction}} in small wires is generally 15–25% and in larger wires is 20–45%. The exact die sequence {{for a particular}} job {{is a function of}} area reduction, input wire size and output wire size. As the area reduction changes, <b>so</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> die sequence.|$|E
25|$|The {{ratio of}} glia to neurons {{increases}} with our definition of intelligence. Not {{only does the}} ratio of glia to neurons increase through evolution, but <b>so</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> size of the glia. Astroglial cells in the human have a volume 27 {{times greater than the}} same cells in the mouse's brain.|$|E
25|$|As the observer's {{latitude}} increases (he travels north) <b>so</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> declination. The pole rises {{over the}} horizon by an angle of the same amount. The elevation at the terrestrial North Pole is 90° (straight up) and the celestial pole has a declination of the same value. The latitude also is 90.|$|E

The Financial Times, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Business Advisory Council, the Confederation of British Industry, and the Adam Smith Institute have also spoken out against a global financial transaction tax.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, wands {{are able}} to be won from a witch or wizard and can {{therefore}} change their allegiance. This is the case when Harry takes Draco's wand at Malfoy Manor, and consequently the wand's allegiance swaps to Harry, as explained by Ollivander; and, by extension, <b>so</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> allegiance of the Elder Wand, which itself has changed hands many times.|$|E
25|$|In the cricket season, Wal {{plays for}} an unknown team as an all-rounder, {{although}} he is sometimes pictured as the wicket keeper. Cooch often plays cricket with Wal and <b>so</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> dog, usually fielding in the slips or in the covers (wherein the dog's alias of 'The Scarlet Manuka' sometimes comes into play, as the Dog steals the cricket balls to 'rescue' them from persecution).|$|E

50|$|There {{appears to}} be a link between the {{presence}} of Loaghtan sheep and the ability of the chough to thrive. Studies on Ramsey Island, Bardsey Island, and the Isle of Man have found that as the number of grazing sheep fell, <b>so</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> number of breeding choughs; when sheep grazing increased, <b>so</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> number of breeding choughs. This {{appears to be}} occurring on Jersey as well.|$|R
25|$|There {{is also a}} lack of good {{water rights}} that govern the use of water {{resulting}} in confusion about what body or individual {{has the right to}} use a particular water resource. Institutions are state agencies and whenever the political atmosphere and leadership change, <b>so</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> leadership of the institutions. This constant turnover in leadership does not lend itself to successful management of water resources institutions.|$|E
25|$|This {{concept that}} the public sphere acts as a medium in which public opinion is formed as {{analogous}} to a lava lamp. Just as the lamp's structure changes, with its lava separating and forming new shapes, <b>so</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> public sphere's creation of opportunities for discourse to address public opinion, thereby forming new discussions of rhetoric. The lava of the public which holds together the public arguments is the public conversation.|$|E
25|$|Angiotensin is {{involved}} in regulating aldosterone and is the core regulation. Angiotensin II acts synergistically with potassium, and the potassium feedback is virtually inoperative when no angiotensin II is present. A {{small portion of the}} regulation resulting from angiotensin II must take place indirectly from decreased blood flow through the liver due to constriction of capillaries. When the blood flow decreases <b>so</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> destruction of aldosterone by liver enzymes.|$|E
