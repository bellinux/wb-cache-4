40|$|Abstract. This paper {{illustrates}} the OntoWeaver modelling approach, which {{relies on a}} set of comprehensive site ontologies to model all aspects of dataintensive web sites and thus offers high level support for the design and development of data-intensive web sites. In particular, the OntoWeaver site ontologies comprise two components: a <b>site</b> <b>view</b> ontology and a presentation ontology. The <b>site</b> <b>view</b> ontology provides meta-models to allow for the composition of sophisticated site views, which allow end users to navigate and manipulate the underlying domain databases. The presentation ontology abstracts the look and feel for site views and makes it possible for the visual appearance and layout to be specified at a high level of abstraction. ...|$|E

40|$|Building a data-intensive {{web site}} is a complex task. Ad hoc rapid {{prototyping}} approaches easily lead to unsatisfactory results, e. g. poor maintainability and extensibility. To address this problem, a number of model-based approaches have been proposed, which attempt to simplify the design and development of data-intensive web sites. However, these approaches typically lack expressive meta-models and, as a result, suffer {{from a number of}} limitations, e. g. the lack of appropriate support for the creation of complex user interfaces, for the specification of layouts and presentation styles, and for customization. In this paper we describe a new software tool OntoWeaver, which uses ontologies to drive the design and development of data-intensive web sites. OntoWeaver overcomes the problems of current approaches by providing a <b>site</b> <b>view</b> ontology, a presentation ontology, and a customization framework. Specifically, the <b>site</b> <b>view</b> ontology provides fine-grained modelling support for the creation of complex user interfaces and navigation structures. The presentation ontology captures the features of layouts and presentation styles of user interface elements. These two explicit meta-models allow the target web site to be represented in a declarative and re-usable format, thus enabling high level support for design, maintenance, and customization. The customization framework exploits this advantage and provides comprehensive customization support for the target web site at design as well as run time...|$|E

40|$|The large {{multidisciplinary}} academic {{social web}} site ResearchGate aims to help academics {{to connect with}} each other and to publicise their work. Despite its popularity, {{little is known about the}} age and discipline of the articles uploaded and viewed in the site and whether publication statistics from the site could be useful impact indicators. In response, this article assesses samples of ResearchGate articles uploaded at specific dates, comparing their views in the site to their Mendeley readers and Scopus-indexed citations. This analysis shows that ResearchGate is dominated by recent articles, which attract about three times as many views as older articles. ResearchGate has uneven coverage of scholarship, with the arts and humanities, health professions, and decision sciences poorly represented and some fields receiving twice as many views per article as others. View counts for uploaded articles have low to moderate positive correlations with both Scopus citations and Mendeley readers, which is consistent with them tending to reflect a wider audience than Scopus-publishing scholars. Hence, for articles uploaded to the <b>site,</b> <b>view</b> counts may give a genuinely new audience indicator...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{investigated the}} current inadequate holistic training practices given to tower crane operators which significantly impact {{health and safety}} in Gauteng, South African construction projects. The primary motivation for conducting the research was due to tower crane related accidents, fatalities and related project delays which have become endemic in the construction industry. These occurrences have not been researched {{from the perspective of}} the basic training given to tower crane operators in the SA construction industry. The study sought to examine the current structure and characteristics of the training programmes used in developing the skills of tower crane operators. This included exploring the current barriers and the effectiveness experienced in the training programmes given to tower crane operators. The study also sought to find the major improvements or restructuring that is still needed in skills development and training of tower crane operators from the perspective of tower crane operators. It consisted of a sample of 25 tower crane operators trained in various skills development programmes used in the South African construction industry. The research also included interviews from 9 site foremen and managers who manage the operations of tower cranes during construction project delivery, who also provided key data in relation to the training practices of tower crane operators from the manner in which their contractors conduct them. The study found several major factors contributing to inadequate holistic training of tower crane operators related to the following: the manner in which the current training programmes were structured in terms of theoretical and practical training; lack of effectiveness of the training programmes in terms of safety, communication, rigging and hoisting and the important knowledge of tower crane operations; inefficiency of tower cranes in terms of the technological aspects that relate to giving a clearer <b>site</b> <b>view</b> of the environment in which lifting and unloading of construction materials was conducted; inadequately trained banksman or signalers and lack of training in general personalities needed in operating tower cranes as the main contributing factors. These major factors that the study found to contribute to tower crane related accidents need to be addressed if the continuing accidents and fatalities are to be significantly reduced in Gauteng, South African construction projects during project delivery and execution...|$|E
