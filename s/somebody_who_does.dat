25|$|Income {{taxation}} has {{the worst}} effect on {{division of labor}} {{in the form of}} barter. Suppose that the person doing job B is actually interested in having job A done for him. Now suppose you could amazingly do job A four times over, selling half your work on the market for cash just to pay your tax bill. The other half of the work you do for <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> job B twice over but he has to sell off half to pay his tax bill. You're left with one unit of job B, but only if you were 400% as productive doing job A! In this case of 50% tax on barter income, anything less than 400% productivity will cause the division of labor to fail.|$|E

500|$|Ana Lucia was {{described}} by Melanie McFarland of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer as [...] "demanding", [...] "hostile" [...] and a [...] "bully". She called Ana Lucia a [...] "brooding, broken ex-cop" [...] with a [...] "perpetual scowl". McFarland described the character as someone with a [...] "take-charge nature", and an [...] "inability to be reasoned away from her dictatorial decisions". Anna Johns from AOL's TV Squad felt Ana Lucia is [...] "abrasive and lacking common sense or civility". C. K. Sample, also from TV Squad, thought Ana Lucia was [...] "angry", [...] "power mad" [...] and a [...] "total nut job". According to supervising producer Leonard Dick, [...] "Ana Lucia is <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> {{not want to be}} a victim. She was a victim once and she swore to herself she would never be a victim again".

She is [...] "street smart" [...] and has a [...] "speak-her-mind quality".|$|E

[...] The Michigan Alumnus also defended Hammond:"Mr. Hammond, it is said, was enticed away from school and admitted into the University because he was an athlete. [...] I have the word of as truthful a man as walks, who knew the circumstances of his coming here, that Mr. Hammond was not enticed away from school, and I know of my own knowledge that the fact of his being an athlete did not facilitate his admission to college. [...] It is impossible here to substantiate with proofs the statement that I have here made about Mr. Hammond's case. [...] Possibly my assertion is at least as valuable as that of <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not know the facts." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 8. Never {{forget that}} if you leave your law to judges and your {{religion}} to bishops, you will presently find yourself without either law or religion. If you doubt this, ask any decent judge or bishop. Do NOT ask <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not know what a judge is, or what a bishop is, or what the law is, or what religion is. In other words, do not ask your newspaper. Journalists are too poorly paid {{in this country to}} know anything that is fit for publication.|$|E
60|$|A moment's reflection, however, sufficed to {{save the}} ingenuous young man from the pitfall of so serious a social solecism. It would be fatal to accost him. For, mark you, no matter how gentlemanly and well-tailored a {{stranger}} may look, {{you can never be}} sure nowadays (in these topsy-turvy times of subversive radicalism) whether he is or is not really a gentleman. That makes acquaintanceship a dangerous luxury. If you begin by talking to a man, be it ever so casually, he may desire to thrust his company upon you, willy-nilly, in future; and when you have ladies of your family living in a place, you really CANNOT be too particular what companions you pick up there, were it even in the most informal and momentary fashion. Besides, the fellow {{might turn out to be}} one of your social superiors, and not care to know you; in which case, of course, you would only be letting yourself in for a needless snubbing. In fact, in this modern England of ours, this fatherland of snobdom, one passes one's life in a see-saw of doubt, between the Scylla and Charybdis of those two antithetical social dangers. You are always afraid you may get to know somebody you yourself do not want to know, or may try to know <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not want to know you.|$|E

50|$|Employers {{might want}} to dress up a {{redundancy}} as a business reorganisation to circumvent disciplinary procedure (e.g. right to be accompanied), consultation, paid time off and redundancy payments. Employers may want to save face for both parties where the real ground is conduct that was not addressed in time, capability {{that is difficult to}} prove, pregnancy or the hope simply that <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not figure in future plans will grab an enhanced redundancy payment and run. In such a case {{it will be hard to}} overturn the employer's claim of redundancy, but a genuine redundancy can still be unfair dismissal.

5000|$|In March 2010, Grayling was {{recorded}} at an open {{meeting of the}} Centre for Policy Studies think tank saying that during the debates on civil liberties under the Labour Government, he had felt that Christians {{should have the right}} to live by their consciences and that Christian owners of bed and breakfasts {{should have the right to}} turn away gay couples. Grayling said:"I personally always took the view that, if you look at the case of should a Christian hotel owner have the right to exclude a gay couple from a hotel, I took the view that if it's a question of <b>somebody</b> <b>who's</b> <b>doing</b> a B&B in their own home, that individual should have the right to decide <b>who</b> <b>does</b> and <b>who</b> doesn't come into their own home. If they are running a hotel on the high street, I really don’t think that it is right in this day and age that a gay couple should walk into a hotel and be turned away because they are a gay couple, and I think that is where the dividing line comes." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was simple}} but convincing, for it {{explained}} {{the efficiency of}} the Indian's tools, and also why he had not progressed. He worked along the same line, sticking to one simple implement until he had perfected it, and, though this was his greatest disadvantage, the man who killed the fish generally made the spear. He got so far and stopped, content, and incapable of going any farther. The white man, on the other hand, changed his methods continually with his changing needs and, what counted more than all, he very seldom made the tools he used, because he had discovered that <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> nothing else could make them better. When the Americans of the Pacific Slope wanted salmon they did not whittle spears, but sent east to the cordage factories, whose owners brought in fibers {{from all over the world}} and spun the netting with which to build gigantic fish traps.|$|R
5000|$|Rabbit is {{the only}} 'Free for All' game mode in Tribes: Vengeance. In this, there are no teams, but a single flag on the map somewhere, usually {{in the middle of}} the map. The {{objective}} for every player is to retrieve the flag and run. Whenever a player retrieves the flag, every other player will be alerted, and whoever has the flag will be marked as their enemy. Points are gained by holding on to the flag as long as possible and killing the other players. Points are lost by killing <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> not have the flag. No points are gained by killing the flag carrier. The game is timed, and whoever has the most points at the end is the winner. This game mode is common to all Tribes games, as well as many other games.|$|E

His father had served in the First World War, from which he returned wounded, suffering from shell shock and silent about his experiences. As Blishen recalled: [...] "He wasn't sympathetic to pacifists. He felt that if he had fought a war, then I ought to fight a war as well." [...] But having read some of the now-famous books revealing the horrors of the First World War, the younger Blishen realised: [...] "I can't be <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> <b>does</b> that to someone else." [...] Registering as a CO was an uncomfortable experience: [...] "Everybody was declaring themselves at one counter, and there was this other forlorn counter for you to declare you weren't going to join in.

5000|$|Slacker became {{widely used}} in the 1990s {{to refer to a}} subset of apathetic youth who were cynical and uninterested in {{political}} or social causes and as a stereotype for members of Generation X. Richard Linklater, director of the aforementioned 1991 film, commented on the term's meaning in a 1995 interview, stating that [...] "I think the cheapest definition a slacker would be someone who's just lazy, hangin' out, doing nothing.
