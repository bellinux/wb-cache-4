[...] "There were many more people with aspirations than space to accommodate them, and they all seemed ready to jump ship when they felt they were being excluded" [...] <b>said</b> <b>Janet</b> Kelly, a Veneuelan political commentator. Columnist Patricia Poleo of the Caracas newspaper El Nuevo Pais joined several government officials when she later suggested that during Carmona's tenure, Isaac Perez Recao, {{a member of a}} family that owned a controlling stake in a firm called Venoco, a subsidiary of which Carmona ran, had allegedly been a key financier of the coup and had been pulling strings behind the scenes.

It caught the democratic opposition by surprise." [...] The Miami Herald reported that [...] "moderate politicians complained that Carmona, a centrist businessman, had been 'hijacked' by rightists." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For God's sake, madam, consider," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Janet,</b> {{trembling}} with apprehension; [...] "who would cumber themselves about pedlar's tidings?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be silly," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Janet,</b> out of humour with herself, and annoyed {{because she}} could not then {{appreciate}} Eda's generosity.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's utterly {{out of the}} question," [...] <b>said</b> Aunt <b>Janet</b> seriously. When Aunt <b>Janet</b> <b>said</b> seriously that {{anything}} {{was out of the}} question it meant that she was thinking about it, and would probably end up by doing it. If a thing really {{was out of the question}} she merely laughed and refused to discuss it at all.|$|R

6000|$|... 'What is it?' <b>said</b> <b>Janet,</b> {{her face}} beaming {{at the sound}} of the pet name, now heard so seldom. 'Anything to do with conveyancing?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm afraid Bobus {{would apply}} himself to finding how much caseine matter {{was in the}} cow's milk," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Janet</b> in her womanly tone.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's strange!" [...] <b>said</b> <b>Janet.</b> [...] "I {{thought there}} was {{somebody}} else when I first came out. Still, of course, it was nearly dark." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{wonder what}} on earth you young ones will do next," [...] <b>said</b> Aunt <b>Janet</b> in the {{helpless}} tone {{of a woman who}} gives it up.|$|R
6000|$|... "You know best, Julian," [...] <b>said</b> Lady <b>Janet.</b> [...] "But I own I don't quite see in {{what way}} I am {{interested}} {{in this part of}} the story." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Give {{her a good}} dose of Mexican Tea and {{try that}} first," [...] <b>said</b> Aunt <b>Janet.</b> [...] "I've saved many a doctor's bill in my family by using Mexican Tea." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you. Since {{you like}} to treat your {{daughter}} like a maidservant, you may go on and search my boxes," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Janet,</b> sulkily.|$|E

6000|$|... "I dunno," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Janet</b> hopelessly. [...] "I dunno if I {{could ever}} get up enough spunk. Things have drifted so long. But I'll think it over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I had {{any money}} of my own," [...] Alora <b>said</b> to <b>Janet</b> Orme {{on the morning}} of the twelfth day of imprisonment, [...] "I would gladly pay it to free." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll {{do nothing}} of the sort," [...] <b>said</b> Aunt <b>Janet.</b> [...] "Sara must not do penance in that way. She would wear holes in her stockings, and might seriously bruise her feet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nobody's {{endurance}} will {{be tried}} much longer," [...] <b>said</b> Lady <b>Janet.</b> She glanced at Julian, and taking from her pocket the card which he had given to her, opened the library door.|$|R
6000|$|... "I found it-—in {{his table}} drawer; I {{saw it was}} not valid, so I kept {{it out of the}} way from {{consideration}} for you," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Janet.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Aunt Ellen {{took her}} home," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Janet.</b> [...] "She {{said she would}} send her back at bed-time, but she thought we should be more {{comfortable}} alone to-night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{heard what}} papa said to you. I kept the white slate till {{you thought of}} it," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Janet,</b> {{in a tone that}} sounded soft from her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] <b>said</b> Aunt <b>Janet,</b> {{when we all}} {{descended to}} the kitchen, [...] "this {{is the first time}} you young ones have ever all got up without being called, and that's a fact." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{shall be}} done immediately," [...] <b>said</b> Lady <b>Janet.</b> [...] "What surprises me Julian (ring the bell, if you please), {{is that you}} should {{describe}} yourself in your letter as feeling an interest in this person." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{letter is}} from James Ward's wife in Montreal," [...] <b>said</b> Aunt <b>Janet</b> solemnly. [...] "Rachel Ward is dead. And she told James' wife {{to write to}} {{me and tell me}} to open the old blue chest." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Mrs. Lucas came to {{stay with}} me, but I didn't want her," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Janet,</b> [...] "so I told her she might go home to dinner. It's father-—" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here {{are a dozen}} handkerchiefs," [...] <b>said</b> Aunt <b>Janet.</b> [...] "Look at {{the initial}} {{in the corner of}} each. Rachel learned that stitch from a nun in Montreal. It looks as if it was woven into the material." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I couldn't," [...] <b>said</b> poor <b>Janet</b> pathetically. [...] "You see, Anne, I've {{always been}} awful fond of John. He {{might just as}} well keep coming as not, for there was never anybody else I'd want, so it didn't matter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{woman is}} plainly mad," [...] <b>said</b> Lady <b>Janet.</b> [...] "But it is {{certainly}} a startling form of madness when one first hears of it. Of course we must keep the matter, for the present at least, a secret from Grace." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't talk such nonsense," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Janet,</b> with {{an elder}} sisterly air. [...] "It is not kind to {{encourage}} Jessie to think anyone can care for an empty-headed doll." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I bought {{you some}} books, madam," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Janet,</b> [...] "from a lame fellow who sold {{them in the}} Market-place--and who stared {{something}} boldly, at me, I promise you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would not}} accept this gold either," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Janet,</b> [...] "but that I hope to find a use for it which will bring a blessing on us all." ...|$|E
50|$|It is <b>said</b> that <b>Janet</b> {{was buried}} at Newliston near Edinburgh, but Janet's brother John, later Earl of Stair, married Elizabeth Dundas of Newliston in 1669, {{and he may}} not have been at Newliston when Janet died. Janet may have been buried by her husband at Glenluce.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear me!" [...] <b>said</b> Aunt <b>Janet,</b> {{sitting down}} helplessly. [...] "If that isn't like Blair! Of course he couldn't come like anybody else.

6000|$|... "Well, I'm {{thankful to}} be home again" [...] <b>said</b> Aunt <b>Janet,</b> beaming on us. [...] "We had a real nice time, and Edward's folks were as kind as could be. But give me home for a steady thing. How has {{everything}} gone? How did the children behave, Roger?" ...|$|R
