5|$|The Yankee {{opponent}} in the 1951 World Series was the Giants, with Game 1 played the day after they won the National League pennant in the Miracle of Coogan's Bluff. On an emotional high, the Giants beat the Yankees in Game 1 at Yankee Stadium. Game 2 was a Yankee victory, but Mantle suffered a knee injury and was out for the Series, the start of knee problems that would darken Mantle's career. The Giants won Game 3, but DiMaggio <b>stepped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fore, with six hits in the following three games, including a home run to crown his career. The Yankees won Games 4 and 5, and staked Raschi to a 4–1 lead in Game 6 before Stengel had Johnny Sain pitch in relief. When Sain loaded the bases with none out in the ninth, Stengel brought in Bob Kuzava, a left hander, to pitch against the Giants, even though right handers Monte Irvin and Bobby Thomson were due to bat. The Giants scored twice, but Kuzava hung on. The Yankees and Stengel had their third straight World Series championship.|$|E

Though the Rays' {{management}} preferred that Kazmir rest his arm and not pitch in the mid-summer classic if at all possible, the game ended up being the longest ever and Kazmir <b>stepped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mound in the 15th inning. He threw a scoreless frame and the AL all-stars scored the winning run {{in the bottom of the}} 15th, making Kazmir the winning pitcher.|$|E

25|$|During Robinson's spring {{training}} with the Dodgers, {{he had been}} hit repeatedly by white pitchers when he <b>stepped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plate. Many expected the same to occur in Jersey City. But Sandel had played against Robinson, also a Californian, in baseball games {{on the west coast}} and harbored no ill feelings toward him. After the first several pitches were thrown and the count ran to 2-1, Dick Bouknight, the Giants catcher, walked to the mound and demanded to know if Sandell was going to throw at Robinson. Sandel refused. After running up a 3-2 count, Robinson ground out harmlessly to the shortstop.|$|E
25|$|The Razorbacks, {{ranked as}} high as 15, took on the No.16 Alabama Crimson Tide in Baum Stadium for their SEC home opener. Arkansas scored four runs {{in the eighth inning}} of game one, leading to a 9–8 victory. Game two also ended in a Razorback comeback. The Hogs, down 3–0 in the seventh inning, got a big hit from pinch hitter Thomas Hauskey. The senior catcher <b>stepped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plate with a runner on second base and two outs {{in the bottom of the}} ninth, and {{delivered}} a clutch RBI single to win the game. Collin Kuhn, Zack Cox, Andy Wilkins and Brett Eibner each hit home runs in game three to give the Hogs a 10–5 win. The sweep was the first of Alabama since 2006.|$|E
25|$|On Saturday, February 23, 1985 {{during a}} game at Bloomington between Purdue and Indiana, just five minutes into the game, a {{scramble}} for a loose ball resulted in a foul call on Indiana's Marty Simmons. Immediately after the resumption of play, a foul was called on Indiana's Daryl Thomas. Knight, irate, insisted {{the first of the}} two calls should have been for a jump ball and ultimately received a technical foul. Purdue's Steve Reid <b>stepped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> free throw line to shoot the resulting free throws, but before he could, Knight grabbed a red plastic chair from Indiana's bench and threw it across the floor toward the basket in front of Reid. Knight was charged with second and third technical fouls and was ejected from the game. He apologized for his actions the next day and was given a one-game suspension and two years probation from the Big Ten. Since the incident, Knight has occasionally joked about throwing the chair by saying that he saw an old lady standing on the opposite sideline and threw her the chair so she could sit down.|$|E

500|$|The brief pause from {{politics}} out of national grief at Taylor's death did not abate the crisis.

By July 31, Clay's bill was effectively dead, as all the significant provisions had been deleted by amendment other than the organization of Utah Territory—one wag put it that the [...] "Mormons" [...] were the only remaining passengers on the Omnibus.

Fillmore endorsed this strategy, with the Omnibus to become (as it proved) five bills.|$|E
500|$|Jordan {{played in}} his final NBA game on April 16, 2003 in Philadelphia. After scoring only 13 points in the game, Jordan went to the bench with 4 minutes and 13 seconds {{remaining}} {{in the third quarter}} and with his team trailing the Philadelphia 76ers, 75–56. Just after the start of the fourth quarter, the First Union Center crowd began chanting [...] "We want Mike!" [...] After much encouragement from coach Doug Collins, Jordan finally rose from the bench and re-entered the game, replacing Larry Hughes with 2:35 remaining. At 1:45, Jordan was intentionally fouled by the 76ers' Eric Snow, and <b>stepped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> line to make both free throws. After the second foul shot, the 76ers in-bounded the ball to rookie John Salmons, who in turn was intentionally fouled by Bobby Simmons one second later, stopping time so that Jordan could return to the bench. Jordan received a three-minute standing ovation from his teammates, his opponents, the officials, and the crowd of 21,257 fans.|$|E

Despite Adams' {{impressive}} opening performance, by the third day of the match, Sexton was far in the lead. In Dewey-Defeats-Truman-style, many newspapers reported that Sexton won the tournament, as their reporters left the venue at a time when Sexton had a seemingly indomitable lead and before the match was over. The New York Times, for example, reported that Sexton won the match, though they leavened the result by reporting that despite the prize fund, it was a [...] "friendly match", geared toward exhibition, and that [...] "Adams could undoubtedly have run the game out on three occasions, but preferred to make 'display' shots in place of his usual [...] "nurse" [...] play, against which a cue player stands no chance whatever." [...] However, with Sexton needed only seven points to win the championship, Adams <b>stepped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> table and ran out, making 1,181 points in a row to win the match.|$|E

Cornell was {{in the writing process}} of a second solo album, but decided to shelve that and pursue the opportunity to work with Tom Morello, Tim Commerford and Brad Wilk when they approached him. Morello described Cornell: [...] "He <b>stepped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> microphone and sang the song and I couldn't believe it. It didn't just sound good. It sounded transcendent.

2500|$|Pippen {{claimed the}} {{starting}} small forward {{position with the}} Portland Trail Blazers in the 1999–2000 NBA season. Playing alongside new stars such as Rasheed Wallace and Steve Smith, Pippen continued to demonstrate his defensive capabilities, even past his prime. On January 3, when the Trail Blazers faced the Bulls, Pippen was honored with a video tribute highlighting his best moments in his 11-year career with the Bulls. Pippen later commented on the tribute by saying: [...] "It was very emotional for me, but I tried to handle {{it as well as}} possible realizing I had a game to play. It was something that brought back a lot of memories for me, a lot of things I miss about this city, playing in this arena." [...] Under Head coach Mike Dunleavy, the Trail Blazers posted a 59–23 record and clinched the second spot in the Pacific Division and the third spot in the Western Conference. Pippen played and started in all 82 games that season, averaging 12.5 points per game, 5 assists and 6.3 rebounds per game. In {{the first round of the}} 2000 NBA Playoffs, Portland defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 3 games to 1. Their opponents in the second round were the Utah Jazz. In Game 5, while leading the series 3–1, with 12.6 seconds remaining and Portland trailing by 2, Pippen inbounded the ball to Damon Stoudamire who returned it to Pippen, who hit a three pointer with 7.3 seconds remaining. The Jazz fouled Pippen on the next play, and he <b>stepped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> line and made one of two free throws to give the Blazers a 81–79 lead. Bryon Russell of the Jazz attempted a game-winning three-pointer but threw the shot off balance, which resulted in an air ball. The Trail Blazers won the series 4–1 and advanced to the Western Conference Finals. There they faced the Los Angeles Lakers, coached under Phil Jackson, Pippen's former coach in Chicago. The series was stretched to a deciding Game 7, in which the Trail Blazers held a 15-point lead in the 4th quarter. However, led by the All-Star duo of Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal, the Lakers managed to erase Portland's lead and win the game 89–84 and with that also the series. The Lakers proceeded to the 2000 NBA Finals where they faced the Indiana Pacers and were eventually crowned the NBA Champions.|$|E
