Otto Wagner incorporated numerous features specifically related to its function within an asylum: e.g. {{there are very few}} <b>sharp</b> <b>edges,</b> <b>and</b> most <b>corners</b> are rounded; almost no crosses are visible; the priest's area is potentially entirely separate from the patients'; access to the pulpit is only from the vestry; emergency exits are built into the side walls in case a patient needed to be speedily removed; continuously flowing water replaced holy water stoups at the entrance; there were separate entrances for male and female patients, since gender segregation was mandatory in mental institutions at the time; confessionals were more open than is customary. There were toilet facilities easily accessible within the church in case of patient need. Originally the pews were of different widths to accommodate different categories of patient: calm / restless / disturbed (the latter needing more space). The floor is raked as in a theatre though not as steeply; the fall from entrance to altar is approx. 26 cm: standing at the back the view to the altar is thus less obstructed.|$|R
40|$|Recovering {{high quality}} {{surfaces}} from noisy triangulated surfaces is a fundamental important problem in geometry processing. <b>Sharp</b> features including <b>edges</b> <b>and</b> <b>corners</b> can not be well preserved in most existing denoising methods except the recent total variation (TV) and ℓ_ 0 regularization methods. However, these two methods have suffered producing staircase artifacts in smooth regions. In this paper, we first introduce a second order regularization method for restoring a surface normal vector field, and then propose a new vertex updating scheme to recover the desired surface according to the restored surface normal field. The proposed model can preserve sharp features and simultaneously suppress the staircase effects in smooth regions which overcomes the drawback of the first order models. In addition, the new vertex updating scheme can prevent ambiguities introduced in existing vertex updating methods. Numerically, the proposed high order model is solved by the augmented Lagrangian method with a dynamic weighting strategy. Intensive numerical experiments {{on a variety of}} surfaces demonstrate the superiority of our method by visually and quantitatively. Comment: 24 pages, 12 figures, 2 table...|$|R

The Gaussians are stretched along the lines and their widths are selected to reproduce <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> <b>and</b> <b>corners</b> in the surface. When {{the length of the}} lines becomes zero, the formulation converges to a weighted sum of points. Therefore, traditional weighted mean approximations that are defined in terms of rational weights become a special case of the proposed method.

40|$|Point sets {{obtained}} from computer vision techniques are often noisy and non-uniform. We present a new method of surface reconstruction {{that can handle}} such data sets using anisotropic basis functions. Our reconstruction algorithm draws upon the work in variational implicit surfaces for constructing smooth and seamless 3 D surfaces. Implicit functions are often formulated as a sum of weighted basis functions that are radially symmetric. Using radially symmetric basis functions inherently assumes, however that the surface to be reconstructed is, everywhere, locally symmetric. Such an assumption is true only at planar regions, and hence, reconstruction using isotropic basis is insufficient to recover objects that exhibit sharp features. We preserve sharp features using anisotropic basis that allow the surface to vary locally. The reconstructed surface is <b>sharper</b> along <b>edges</b> <b>and</b> at <b>corner</b> points. We determine the direction of anisotropy at a point by performing principal component {{analysis of the data}} points in a small neighborhood. The resulting field of principle directions across the surface is smoothed through tensor filtering.

50|$|Electroforming is a {{metal forming}} process that forms parts through {{electrodeposition}} on a model, {{known in the}} industry as a mandrel. Conductive (metallic) mandrels are passivated (chemically) to preclude 'plating' and thereby to allow subsequent separation of the finished electroform. Non-conductive (glass, silicon, plastic) mandrels require the deposition of a conductive layer prior to electrodeposition. Conductive layers can be deposited chemically, or using vacuum deposition techniques (e.g., gold sputtering). The outer surface of the mandrel forms the inner surface of the form. The process involves high current through very clean water, having no more than about 5 parts per million organic contamination. The 'thrown' ions find their missing electrons on the mandrel, which is in electrical contact with the cathode of the electroforming tank. The ions deposit as neutral metal atoms, which bind to each other. Metal is electrodeposited until it {{is strong enough to}} be self-supporting. The mandrel is most often separated intact or dissolved away after forming, but occasionally (as in the case in decorative electroforming) left in place. The surface of the finished part that was in intimate contact with the mandrel is rendered in fine detail with respect to the original, and is not subject to the shrinkage that would normally be experienced in a foundry cast metal object, or the tool marks of a milled part. The side of the part that was in contact with the electroforming solution is less well defined, and that loss of definition increases with thickness of the deposit. In extreme cases, where a thickness of several millimetres is required, there is preferential build-up of material on <b>sharp</b> outside <b>edges</b> <b>and</b> <b>corners.</b> This tendency can be reduced by a process known as periodic reverse, where the electroforming current is reversed for short periods and the excess is preferentially etched away. The finished form can either be the finished part, or {{can be used in a}} subsequent process to produce a positive of the original mandrel shape, such as with vinyl record stamper manufacture.|$|R
40|$|To handle broken 3 D {{models can}} be a very time {{consuming}} problem. Several methods aiming for automatic mesh repair have been presented in the recent years. This thesis gives an extensive evaluation of automatic mesh repair algorithms, presents a mesh repair pipeline and describes an implemented automatic mesh repair algorithm. The presented pipeline for automatic mesh repair includes three main steps: octree generation, surface reconstruction and ray casting. Ray casting is for removal of hidden objects. The pipeline also includes a pre processing step for removal of intersecting triangles and a post processing step for error detection. The implemented algorithm presented in this thesis is a volumetric method for mesh repair. It generates an octree in which data from the input model is saved. Before creation of the output, the octree data will be patched to remove inconsistencies. The surface reconstruction is done with a method called Manifold Dual Contouring. First new vertices are created from the information saved in the octree. Then there is a possibility to cluster vertices together for decimation of the output. Thanks to a special Manifold criterion, the output is guaranteedto be manifold. Furthermore the output will have <b>sharp</b> <b>and</b> clear <b>edges</b> <b>and</b> <b>corners</b> thanks to the use of Singular Value Decomposition during determination of the positions of the new vertices...|$|R

But the <b>sharp</b> <b>edges</b> <b>and</b> fine details can be preserved well using appropriate edge stopping function.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a feature-preserving mesh {{denoising}} algorithm which is effective, simple {{and easy to}} implement. The proposed method is a two-stage procedure with a bilateral surface normal filtering followed by integration of the normals for least squares error (LSE) vertex position updates. It is well-known that normal variations offer more intuitive geometric meaning than vertex position variations. A smooth surface {{can be described as}} one having smoothly varying normals whereas features such as edges and corners appear as discontinuities in the normals. Thus we cast feature-preserving mesh denoising as a robust surface normal estimation using bilateral filtering.

Degenerated cells resulting from body-fitting are removed using a splitting strategy and by insertion of buffer layers. Finally, in vicinity of solid walls, layers of highly stretched cells are marched directly from the quadrilateral surface mesh that is a by-product of the body-fitting process. Interfacing between the layer and octree meshes only requires the deformation of the octree to insert the layers. The resulting method is highly automated and significantly reduces turn-around times.
