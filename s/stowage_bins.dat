5000|$|At first, {{a partial}} remedy to {{ammunition}} {{fires in the}} M4 was found in 1943 by welding 1 in appliqué armor plates to the sponson sides over the ammunition <b>stowage</b> <b>bins,</b> though there was doubt that these had any effect. Later models moved ammunition stowage to the hull floor, with water jackets surrounding each stowage bin. The practice, known as wet stowage, reduced the chance of fire after a hit to about 15 percent. The Sherman gained grim nicknames like [...] "Tommycooker" [...] (by the Germans, who referred to British soldiers as [...] "Tommies"; a tommy cooker was a World War I-era trench stove). The British and Germans took to calling it the [...] "Ronson", after the lighter. Fuel fires occasionally occurred, but such fires were far less common and less deadly than ammunition fires. In many cases, the fuel tank of the Sherman was found intact after a fire. Tankers described [...] "fierce, blinding jets of flame", which is inconsistent with gasoline-related fires.|$|E

Some Tiran-6s have [...] "Blazer" [...] reactive armour tiles fitted to the hull and turret. The original engine {{was replaced by a}} General Motors 8V-71T diesel engine. Tiran-6s have a flat plate bustle rack added to the turret rear, two <b>stowage</b> <b>bins</b> (one on the right of the turret and other one on the rear of the turret), a larger headlight bracket on the glacis plate and pintle mounts for machine guns on the turret roof in front of each hatch. The original 115 mm tank gun was replaced by a 105 mm tank gun. The 12.7 mm DShK 1938/46 antiaircraft heavy machine gun was replaced by an M1919 Browning light machine gun. The M2 Browning heavy machine gun was mounted on top of the mantlet of the main gun.|$|E
50|$|In essence the Char D2 is an {{improved}} Char D1. The different turret type used, increases its height somewhat to 266.6 centimetres; the hull is 175.5 centimetres high. The {{length of the}} hull, without tail, is 546 centimetres; its width is reduced to 222.3 centimetres {{through the use of}} a narrower track, 35 centimetres wide. The suspension is largely identical but the top rollers, to which a tension wheel is added, are placed somewhat higher to prevent track resonance, a persistent problem with the Char D1. The armour plate covering the three vertical coil springs consists of six instead of eight panels; mud-chutes are added below each top roller. There are three bogies per side, each with four road wheels, a coil spring and two shock absorbers. In front, and at the back below the sprocket, there is a tension wheel with its own damper; identical to the road wheels proper they bring the total number of such wheels to fourteen. Another change are the fenders with large <b>stowage</b> <b>bins</b> that give the false impression to be part of the main armour.|$|E
5000|$|Reflecting {{trends in}} other designs in this period, the T-44 was {{designed}} without the hull radio operator/machine gunner position present in many older designs. This {{was done for}} a number of reasons. The extensive machine gun firing port in the glacis plate (which was present in the T-34 medium tank) was a weak spot in the armour. In the T-34, this firing port and the driver's hatch were exploited during World War II by the Germans fighting the T-34s. Shooting the machine gun was ineffective as it was inaccurate due to obscured vision. It was considered inefficient to transfer reports through an additional member of the crew and therefore these duties were transferred to the commander. The space saved was used for a fuel tank and to increase the ammunition load. The driver's hatch was {{on the left side of}} the hull roof. The tank had an improved hull design, longer and wider than the T-34 but slightly lower thanks to the relocation of the air filter, with thicker armour, and was simpler to construct. [...] The hull had a sloped glacis plate, vertical sides, and a slightly beveled rear. Most tanks had a splashboard on the glacis plate although there are pictures of T-44A tanks without them. It protected the upper part of the vehicle from splashes of mud or water. There were three mounts for rectangular <b>stowage</b> <b>bins</b> on the fenders (two on the right fender and one on the left fender). There were four mountings for cylindrical fuel tanks on the fenders (two per side). This was changed in the T-44M which used rectangular fuel cells.|$|E

40|$|To {{fulfill the}} need for shorter {{development}} cycles in modern product development {{the increased use of}} computer-aided engineering is one possibility. While the numerical calculation of a model leads to one single solution, the behavior of systems in the real world is never exactly repeatable due to tolerances and natural scatter in the system parameters. The assessment of the resulting uncertainties is of great importance for systems requiring a high level of reliability (such as aerospace systems), therefore they should be treated with special care in the development process and in particular in computer-aided engineering. This paper describes the execution and analysis of an uncertainty management technique with Stochastic Simulation for an LS-DYNA model of an exemplary system consisting of an overhead <b>stowage</b> <b>bin</b> and carry-on baggage excited by external acceleration. The Stochastic Simulation results are evaluated using statistical methods. It is shown which parameters are of paramount influence on system behavior and may hence result in a critical load due to carry-on baggage. KEYWORDS...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is to {{describe}} a crash simulation of a 30 -ft/s vertical drop test of a Boeing 737 (B 737) fuselage section. The drop test of the 10 -ft. long fuselage section of a B 737 aircraft was conducted in November of 2000 at the FAA Technical Center in Atlantic City, NJ. The fuselage section was outfitted with two different commercial overhead <b>stowage</b> <b>bins.</b> In addition, 3, 229 - 1 bs. of luggage were packed in the cargo hold to represent a maximum take-off weight condition. The main objective of the test was to evaluate the response and failure modes of the overhead <b>stowage</b> <b>bins</b> in a narrow-body transport fuselage section when subjected to a severe, but survivable, impact. A secondary objective of the test was to generate experimental data for correlation with the crash simulation. A full-scale 3 -dimensional finite element model of the fuselage section was developed and a crash simulation was conducted using the explicit, nonlinear transient dynamic code, MSC. Dytran. Pre-test predictions of the fuselage and overhead bin responses were generated for correlation with the drop test data. A description of the finite element model and an assessment of the analytical/experimental correlation are presented. In addition, suggestions for modifications to the model to improve correlation are proposed...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-five {{large scale}} {{aircraft}} flammability {{tests were conducted}} in a Boeing 737 fuselage at the NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC). The objective of this test program {{was to provide a}} data base on the propagation of large scale aircraft fires to support the validation of aircraft fire mathematical models. Variables in the test program included cabin volume, amount of fuel, fuel pan area, fire location, airflow rate, and cabin materials. A number of tests were conducted with jet A- 1 fuel only, while others were conducted with various Boeing 747 type cabin materials. These included urethane foam seats, passenger service units, <b>stowage</b> <b>bins,</b> and wall and ceiling panels. Two tests were also included using special urethane foam and polyimide foam seats. Tests were conducted with each cabin material individually, with various combinations of these materials, and finally, with all materials in the cabin. The data include information obtained from approximately 160 locations inside the fuselage...|$|E
40|$|Air {{quality in}} {{aircraft}} cabins {{has long been}} criticized. Current widely-used air distribution systems on airplanes dilute inside generated pollutants by promoting air mixing and thus impose risks of infectious airborne disease transmission. In addition, low moisture content in cabin {{is believed to be}} responsible for headache, tiredness and lots of other unknown symptoms. To restrict air mixing while improving air humidity level, this investigation uses a validated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program to design a new under-aisle displacement air distribution system for wide-body aircraft cabins. The new system supplies fully conditioned outside air at moderate momentum through a narrow channel passage along both side cabin walls to middle height of the cabin just beneath the <b>stowage</b> <b>bins,</b> while simultaneously humid air is supplied through both perforated under aisles. By comparing with the current mixing air distribution system in terms of distribution of CO 2 concentration, relative humidity, velocity and temperature, the new system is found being capable of lessening the inhaled CO 2 concentration by 30 % and can improve the relative humidity from currently 12 % to 22 % without causing draught risks and moisture condensation on cabin walls...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a steady-state or transient, three-dimensional mathematical field model describing aircraft cabin fires. The fire is modelled {{by a simple}} heat source, and the simulation is intended to represent non-spreading fires. The computer code implementing the model uses a body-fitted coordinate (BFC) formulation to describe accurately {{the interior of the}} aircraft, that is neither Cartesian nor polar-cylindrical. The model is first used to predict the experimental results obtained from a series of fire tests performed in a Boeing- 737 fuselage (without fittings). Both steady-state and transient results are presented and discussed. Then the effect of openings in the fuselage and cabin compartmentation on the temperature distribution within the empty aircraft cabin is investigated. With the forward and aft bulkhead doors open, allowing for natural convection, the temperatures are kept to tolerate levels. When the forward door is closed while the aft is kept open, temperatures increase throughout the cabin even in the aft section. With both forward and aft doors open, the cabin is partitioned into two communicating sections, the forward section containing the fire. When compared to the non-compartmented case temperatures in the aft section decrease while temperatures in the forward section increase. With the cabin fitted with seats, ceiling panels and overhead <b>stowage</b> <b>bins</b> the effect of the aircraft's air-conditioning system on the temperature distribution within the burning fuselage is examined. The results suggest that a reverse flow situation (i. e. cold air injected through floor vents and hot air sucked out at ceiling vents) greatly reduces the temperature throughout the fuselage. It is concluded that, although insufficiently validated as yet {{due to the lack of}} extensive and suitable experimental data, the model is promising...|$|E
