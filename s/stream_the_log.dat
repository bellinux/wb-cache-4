The roar of water had a different note in it, and the clangour of the iron sheet {{one of the men}} was pounding rang out harshly. A half-moon hung above the black pines, and dimly-seen men were flitting like shadows toward the waterside. They appeared to know what it was advisable to do, but they stopped just a moment {{on the edge of the}} torrent, for which nobody could have blamed them. The water, streaked with smears of froth and foam, swirled by, and there was a tumultuous white seething where the flood boiled across the log in the midst of the <b>stream.</b> <b>The</b> <b>log</b> blocked the gap left open to let the driftwood through, and, as Nasmyth knew, great trees torn up in distant valleys were coming down with the flood. It seemed to him that he could not reasonably have expected to clear that obstacle with a battalion of log-drivers, and he had only a handful of weary men. Still the men went in, floundering knee-deep in the flood, along the submerged pile of stone and clutching at the piles that bound it to save themselves when the stream threatened to sweep their feet from under them, until they came to the gap where the great tree, rolling in the grip of the torrent, thrashed its grinding branches against the stone.|$|E

As a preliminary, we describe basic characteristics of the most popular real-time services like VoIP, videoconferencing, live media streaming, and network multiplayer games. We focus on the end-to-end latency, bandwidth and efficient transmission methods. Next, we present our project concepts, infrastructure model, details of implementation and our testing environment which was designed for testing many aspects of real-time services. The system combines mechanisms for ensuring best possible connection quality (QoS), load balance of servers in infrastructure and gives control over the packet routing decisions. Additionally, provided security mechanisms make it a good choice even in the environment where a high security level is required. The system is based on the Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) model and data between users is routed over an overlay network, consisting of all participating peers as network nodes. This overlay can by used for application level multicast or live media <b>stream.</b> In <b>the</b> <b>logging</b> process each user is assigned to a specific node (based on his geographic location and nodes load). Because nodes are participating in data transmission, we have control over the data flow route. It is possible to specify the desired route, so, regardless of the external routing protocol, we can avoid paths that are susceptible to eavesdropping. Another feature of the presented system is usage of agents. Each agen...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{distribution}} of Au in a Au-rich {{tributary of the}} Sungai Kuamut, Sabah, Malaysia, was studied initially by the authors in 1999 prior to disturbance of the tropical rain forest by logging. That study found: (i) a strong but extremely erratic Au anomaly with median values of 230 to 690 ppb in the fine and medium sand sized fractions from both cobble and gravel sites; and (ii) Au values typically < 15 ppb in the 53 µm fraction. It was suggested that increased input of fine sediment into <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> after <b>logging</b> might substantially dilute and modify <b>the</b> Au anomaly. <b>Logging</b> of <b>the</b> drainage basin in 2000 – 2001 provided an opportunity to test this possibility. Results from sampling at gravel sites in 2001 show no dilution of Au values after logging. This is attributed to the occurrence of rainfall and flood events that counteracted dilution of the anomaly by releasing deeply buried Au and/or flushing excess fine sediment from <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> channel. It is concluded that the strength of Au anomalies in stream sediments is likely to fluctuate {{as a result of}} the interactions of rainfall events, <b>stream</b> discharge, and <b>the</b> effects of land disturbance on erosion...|$|R

Sediment transport from hillslope logging roads and skid trails resulted in large sediment storage in <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> channels. Riparian reserves appear to mitigate logging impacts to streams; however, more sediment {{was found in a}} tributary channel with a 20 -m buffer than an unlogged channel because some of the nearby roads and skid trails were connected to <b>the</b> <b>stream.</b> Sediment storage in channels declined within 40 months after logging in catchments with and without riparian buffers. Vegetation recovery on skid trails and logging roads reduced both sediment supply and delivery. The volume of large wood was 1. 5 to 2 -times greater in <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> without riparian reserves than <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> of an unlogged catchment or in a stream with a riparian buffer.

40|$|Abstract. To enable {{historical}} {{analyses of}} logged data streams by SQL queries, <b>the</b> <b>Stream</b> <b>Log</b> Analysis System (SLAS) bulk loads data streams derived from sensor readings into a relational database system. SQL queries over such log da-ta often involve numerical conditions containing inequalities, e. g. to find sus-pected deviations from normal behavior {{based on some}} function over measured sensor values. However, such queries are often slow to execute, because the query optimizer is unable to utilize ordered indexed attributes inside numerical conditions. In order {{to speed up the}} queries they need to be reformulated to uti-lize available indexes. In SLAS the query transformation algorithm AQIT (Al-gebraic Query Inequality Transformation) automatically transforms SQL que-ries involving a class of algebraic inequalities into more scalable SQL queries utilizing ordered indexes. The experimental results show that the queries exe-cute substantially faster by a commercial DBMS when AQIT has been applied to preprocess them. ...|$|R

5000|$|Large woody debris (LWD) are <b>the</b> <b>logs,</b> sticks, branches, {{and other}} wood that falls into streams and rivers.
