However, with digitalization, there also comes threats for businesses and sometimes companies are underestimating {{the risks associated with}} cyber-attacks. As the topic is relatively new, there are not many studies that took a deep look at the impact of cyber-attacks on the businesses and analyze those impacts from different angles. The key objective of the thesis was to cover key aspects of the impacts that cyber crimes can have on businesses, taking into account the various types of cyber-attacks, no matter the size and the sector of activity in which the company operates. To achieve this, I used synthesis analysis of real cyber-attacks cases, and I have split each effect into various categories using classification analysis. Furthermore, to study deeply the consequences that cyber incidents can have on businesses, I have analyzed in depth two large corporations that have suffered such attacks, and I have interviewed 15 experts working in the field of cyber-security. This analysis helped to achieve a complete and <b>segmented</b> <b>picture</b> of the impacts that cyber incidents had on businesses and showed how significantly these could affect business...|$|E
40|$|Neovascularization plays {{a pivotal}} role in tissue {{engineering}} and tissue regeneration. However, reliable technologies to visualize and quantify blood vessel networks in target tissue areas are still pending. In this work, we introduce a new method which allows comparing vascularization levels in normal and tissue-engineered skin. Normal skin was isolated, and vascular dermal regeneration was analyzed based on tissue transillumination and computerized digital segmentation. For tissue-engineered skin, a bilateral full skin defect was created in a nude mouse model and then covered with a commercially available scaffold for dermal regeneration. After 3 weeks, the whole skin (including scaffold for dermal regeneration) was harvested, and vascularization levels were analyzed. The blood vessel network in the skin was better visualized by transillumination than by radio-angiographic studies, the gold standard for angiographies. After visualization, the whole vascular network was digitally segmented showing an excellent overlapping with the original pictures. Quantification over the digitally <b>segmented</b> <b>picture</b> was performed, and an index of vascularization area (VAI) and length (VLI) of the vessel network was obtained in target tissues. VAI/VLI ratio was calculated to obtain the vessel size index. We present a new technique which has several advantages compared to others, as animals do not require intravascular perfusions, total areas of interest can be quantitatively analyzed at once, and the same target tissue can be processed for further experimental analysis...|$|E

However, inter-and intrafamilial variability is high. Here we report a familial case of MLS. Methods: A mother and daughter with MLS underwent a complete ophthalmological examination, and extensive imaging, including anterior <b>segment</b> <b>pictures,</b> corneal topography and keratometry, autofluorescence, infrared reflectance and red free images, as well as spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. The mother also underwent full-field flash electroretinography.

40|$|It {{is usually}} {{difficult}} for a beginner to understand precisely and quickly the three-dimensional (3 D) construction of gastric lesions in a gastric X-ray examination with barium meal. In this study, a training-use stomach phantom was developed using the stomach segment to provide beginners {{with an understanding of}} 3 D stomach construction. The hook-shaped phantom (the shape of the stomach when a patient is in the supine position) was formed by using styrene, wire, and clay. It was then coated with dental stiffening agent, and wires were attached along the stomach segment. After drying, the stomach phantom was cut off and the oil clay was removed. The phantom then was immersed in water and the oil clay was dried. After that, the phantom again was glued together with a dental stiffening agent. The usefulness of the phantom was determined by an evaluation experiment. Ten students, as observers, were selected randomly for evaluation from 40 students of the Department of Radiological Technology, College of Medical Technology, Hokkaido University. Eight films were shown to the observers, 4 films with segment and 4 films without segment.

Here we used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to infer the functional organization supporting learning generalization in the human brain. First, we show dissociable contributions of the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) versus lateral occipital (LO) circuits: extracting targets from noise is disrupted by PPC stimulation, in contrast to judging feature differences, which is affected by LO rTMS. Then, we demonstrate that training causes striking changes in this circuit: after feature training, identifying a target in noise is not disrupted by PPC stimulation but instead by LO stimulation. This indicates that training shifts the limits on perception from parietal to ventral brain regions and identifies a critical neural circuit for visual learning.

40|$|Image {{representation}} {{plays an}} important role in image processing applications, which usually. contain a huge amount of data. An image is a two-dimensional array of points, and each point contains information (eg: color). A 1024 by 1024 pixel image occupies 1 mega byte of space in the main memory. In actual circumstances 2 to 3 mega bytes of space are needed to facilitate the various image processing tasks. Large amounts of secondary memory are also required to hold various data sets. In this thesis, two different operations on the quadtree are presented. There are, in general, two types of data compression techniques in image processing. One approach is based on elimination of redundant data from the original picture. Other techniques rely on higher levels of processing such as interpretations, generations, inductions and deduction procedures (1, 2). One of the popular techniques of data representation that has received a considerable amount of attention in recent years is the quadtree data structure. This has led to the development of various techniques for performing conversions and operations on the quadtree. Klinger and Dyer (3) provide a good bibliography of the history of quadtrees. Their paper reports experiments on the degree of compaction of picture representation which may be achieved with tree encoding. Their experiments show that tree encoding can produce memory savings. Pavlidis [15] reports on the approximation of pictures by quadtrees. Horowitz and Pavidis [16] show how to <b>segment</b> a <b>picture</b> using traversal of a quadtree. They <b>segment</b> the <b>picture</b> by polygonal boundaries. Tanimoto [17] discusses distortions which may occur in quadtrees for pictures. Tanimoto [18, p. 27] observes that quadtree representation is particularly convenient for scaling a picture by powers of two. Quadtrees are also useful in graphics and animation applications [19, 20] which are oriented toward construction of images from polygons and superpositiofis of images. Encoded pictures are useful for display, especially if encoding lends itself to processing...|$|R

50|$|The {{flanks of}} Olympus Mons {{are made up}} of innumerable lava flows and lava channels. Many of the flows have levees along their margins (pictured). Levees are {{parallel}} ridges formed at the edges of lava flows. The cooler, outer margins of the flow solidify, leaving a central trough of molten, flowing lava. Partially collapsed lava tubes are visible as chains of pit craters, and broad lava fans formed by lava emerging from intact, subsurface tubes are also common. In places along the volcano's base, lava flows can be seen spilling out into the surrounding plains, forming broad aprons, and burying the basal escarpment. (Note: Lava flows refer to both actively flowing lava and the solidified landforms they produce. The meaning here is the latter, since Mars has no active lava flows at the present time.) Crater counts from high-resolution images taken by the Mars Express orbiter in 2004 indicate that lava flows on the northwestern flank of Olympus Mons range in age from 115 million years old (Mya) to only 2 Mya. These ages are very recent in geological terms, suggesting that the mountain may still be volcanically active, though in a very quiescent and episodic fashion.The caldera complex {{at the peak of the}} volcano is made of at least six overlapping calderas and caldera <b>segments</b> (<b>pictured).</b> Calderas are formed by roof collapse following depletion and withdrawal of the subsurface magma chamber after an eruption.

30|$|Before {{we start}} with a more {{detailed}} description of the algorithm, we take a quick look over the fence into the field of mathematical morphology and its application to image processing. There, watershed algorithms are a well known and extensively studied tool for image segmentation. The basic idea is that a grayscale image {{can be thought of as}} a topographic relief. A drop of water that falls somewhere onto this relief will follow the line of steepest descent until it reaches a local minimum. All points that connect to the same local minimum in that manner form a catchment basin. The watershed algorithm therefore <b>segments</b> the <b>picture</b> into catchment basins. The boundaries of the catchment basins are the actual watersheds. This technique is usually applied to the magnitude of the images gradient. In this way, the watershed lines trace regions of high gradients and segment the original image it into connected regions of small gradients. An excellent overview of the watershed techniques used in image processing is given by Roerdink and Meijster (2000).|$|R

Several boundary conditions have been varied to evaluate their influence toward the experiment.

Electrical isolation of the probe toward the vacuum chamber yielded only slight influence.
