50|$|The {{broadcasts}} of live drama, comedy, {{music and}} news {{that characterize the}} Golden Age of Radio had a precedent in the Théâtrophone, commercially introduced in Paris in 1890 and available as late as 1932. It allowed subscribers to eavesdrop on live stage performances and hear news reports {{by means of a}} network of telephone lines. The development of radio eliminated the wires and <b>subscription</b> <b>charges</b> from this concept.|$|E

50|$|Although TV 2 {{has been}} {{broadcast}} terrestrially {{in the clear}} ever since the channel was launched, from 11 January 2012, it started to encrypt its main channel with a monthly <b>subscription</b> <b>charge</b> of 12.50 Danish Kroner required to be paid, along with the purchase or rental of a decoder In southernmost Sweden and northernmost Germany (where a Danish minority lives), this means significant difficulties for their viewers in Germany and Sweden, as subscribers need a Danish postal address for ordering a decoder card.|$|R

40|$|High print journal {{subscription}} costs, {{access to}} desktop publishing software, {{and awareness of}} Internet capability are among several reasons that interest in the electronic publishing of scholarly journals is increasing rapidly. The economic considerations of electronic publishing are not as familiar, however, although the fingertip accessibility of electronic journals, and in some cases, the lack of <b>subscription</b> <b>charges</b> {{gives the impression that}} electronic journal publishing is a much less costly means of publishing. Such an impression receives qualified confirmation in this article as an overview of the costs of scholarly publishing is provided, and the costs of print and electronic journals are compared. Also addressed are ways to recover costs of publishing electronic journals, and predictions for the future of such journals...|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} {{case study in}} 2009 explored Hindawi’s transition from a subscription-based journal operation to an all open-access publisher, with the bulk of revenues derived from fees from authors rather than <b>subscription</b> <b>charges.</b> Because the company’s growth depends {{on the number of}} articles published each year, the company changed its focus from marketing to end users to developing new products, entering into partnerships with societies and other publishers, and creating a publishing experience for authors and editors that would encourage them to contribute their articles to Hindawi’s journals. Over the past two years, the company’s leadership has continued to develop programmes to launch new journals, while trying to maintain a high level of quality and to shorten the time between article submission and publication...|$|E
40|$|This is {{my first}} {{editorial}} since Internet Archaeology switched completely to open access. Over the last 4 years, we had been making active efforts to achieve our open access goal, by changing to a default CC-BY licence, by opening up our back issues with an annual rolling wall, and by adjusting our <b>subscription</b> <b>charges</b> accordingly. During this time, we also witnessed a marked increase in quality, funded submissions, including several themed issues. Internet Archaeology has always tried {{to be more than}} just a journal. We explore the possibilities of the web and have delved into many different publication formats. This flexibility extends into everything we do. Being a small operation has meant we could be responsive to changes in the wider scholarly landscape, and last year, the journal had simply reached the tipping point. ...|$|E

40|$|When a good {{or service}} is offered {{in a variety of}} qualities with {{corresponding}} marginal prices, a quality-based allocation of consumption units by buyers is induced. This enables a monopolist supplier to achieve partial discrimination among buyers with different consumption preferences. We consider the situation in which a monopoly supplier, with complete information about the distribution of customer preferences, selects a generalized two-part tariff consisting of a single fixed <b>subscription</b> <b>charge</b> and quality dependent marginal charges. We analyze consumer behavior and optimal pricing strategies with and without positive demand externalities. ...|$|R
40|$|Developing {{countries}} are increasingly improving {{their capacity to}} use scientific and technical knowledge to solve local problems. They are investing in communication infrastructure and improving technology policies. For such measures to be effective, those countries also need greater access to the world’s pool of knowledge. Restrictions on access to scientific and health information are hindering progress, particularly in the world’s least-developed countries, and are impeding efforts toward global development. Essential information is locked away behind such barriers as journal <b>subscription</b> <b>charges</b> or individual article download fees. Journal articles are typically subject to restrictive copyright licenses that prevent reproduction, distribution, translation, or the creation of derivative works, all of which would help published work {{to be used for}} innovation. These restrictions are compounded by infrastructure inadequacies and lack of incentives for increasing the use of scientific and technologic knowledge in solving challenges in developing countries...|$|E
40|$|Open {{access is}} at the heart of a seismic shift in {{scholarly}} publishing. In particular, gold open access (OA) has expanded at an accelerated pace, increasing in market share every year. In the gold OA model, financial viability shifts from the demand to the supply side, with article processing charges (APCs) a common scenario. Ideally, this model would be sustainable for academic research institutions, in that it would cost them cumulatively no more to pay APCs than they pay now in the traditional subscription model. APC-driven gold OA has financial and other implications for libraries, institutions, and authors. In the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation-funded Pay It Forward project, we examined the viability of gold OA by looking at institutional costs, faculty and graduate student opinions, and various models for gold OA. The Pay It Forward research teams gathered a variety of qualitative and quantitative data from publishers, research libraries, and faculty and students including current APC charges, current <b>subscription</b> <b>charges,</b> journal publication costs, opinions and behavior of graduate students and faculty members regarding publishing, reading, and OA...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} proposal, the publishers' {{subscription}} income from multiple institutions {{is replaced by}} an "author-side" funding. Journals are paid through contracts between publishers and a single financial partner, the "Sponsoring Consortium for Open Access Publishing in Particle Physics" (SCOAP 3). SCOAP 3 is envisioned as a global network of funding agencies, research laboratories, and libraries that will contribute the necessary funding; each SCOAP 3 partner will recover its contribution from the cancellation of journal subscriptions. This model avoids the obvious disadvantage of authors being directly charged for the OA publication of their articles, which is perceived as an even higher barrier than <b>subscription</b> <b>charges,</b> in particular for theoretical physicists from small institutions who account {{for the vast majority}} of HEP papers. The financing and governance of SCOAP 3 will follow as much as possible the example of the memoranda of understanding governing large research collaborations. Its partners will contribute on a pro-rata basis according to the number of scientific publications from their country or laboratory in a reference period...|$|E
