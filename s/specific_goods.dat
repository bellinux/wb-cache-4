5|$|The {{underlying}} {{driver of}} direct human {{impacts on the}} environment is human consumption. This impact is reduced by not only consuming less but by also making the full cycle of production, use and disposal more sustainable. Consumption {{of goods and services}} can be analysed and managed at all scales through the chain of consumption, starting with the effects of individual lifestyle choices and spending patterns, through to the resource demands of <b>specific</b> <b>goods</b> and services, the impacts of economic sectors, through national economies to the global economy. Analysis of consumption patterns relates resource use to the environmental, social and economic impacts at the scale or context under investigation. The ideas of embodied resource use (the total resources needed to produce a product or service), resource intensity, and resource productivity are important tools for understanding the impacts of consumption. Key resource categories relating to human needs are food, energy, materials and water.|$|E
25|$|The supply-and-demand {{model is}} a partial {{equilibrium}} model of economic equilibrium, where the clearance on the market of some <b>specific</b> <b>goods</b> is obtained independently from prices and quantities in other markets. In other words, the prices of all substitutes and complements, as well as income levels of consumers are constant. This makes analysis much simpler than in a general equilibrium model which includes an entire economy.|$|E

2500|$|In the pairing family, {{the first}} {{indications}} of pairing {{are found in}} families where the husband has one primary wife. Inbreeding is practically eradicated by the prevention of a marriage between two family members who were even just remotely related, while relationships also start to approach monogamy. Property and economics begin to play a larger part in the family, as a pairing family had responsibility for the ownership of <b>specific</b> <b>goods</b> and property. Polygamy is still common amongst men, but no longer amongst women since their fidelity would ensure the child’s legitimacy. Women have a superior role in the family as keepers of the household and guardians of legitimacy. The pairing family is the form characteristic of the lower stages of barbarism. However, at this point, when the man died his inheritance was still given to his gens, rather than to his offspring. Engels refers to this economic advantage for men coupled with the woman's lack of rights to lay claim to possessions for herself or her children (who became hers after a separation) as the overthrow of mother-right which was [...] "the world historical defeat of the female sex". For Engels, ownership of property created the first significant division {{between men and women}} in which the woman was inferior.|$|E

50|$|The {{general rule}} also applies where <b>specific</b> <b>goods</b> must be weighed, measured, or counted. In this regard, a {{distinction}} must be drawn between sales ad quantitatem and sales per aversionem. Where the sale is ad quantitatem, {{there is a}} sale of <b>specific</b> <b>goods,</b> but the price depends on the counting, weighing or measuring: for example, R300 per sheep, for the flock. The risk does not pass in this case until the price has been ascertained by counting the flock.|$|E

40|$|Some rural {{development}} strategies {{are based on}} the assumption that quality labels may act as levers for inducing economic growth and population migration to rural areas. To investigate the validity of this assumption, we use a new economic geography model. A <b>specific</b> (“labelled”) agricultural <b>good</b> is assumed to be produced by farmers who co-operate in order to set a monopoly price and control the number of producers. We find that there is a trade-off between the number of differentiated farmers and their individual income. Besides, the positive effect of agricultural differentiation on rural industrialization, due to increased demand for industrial goods, is offset by an opposite effect due to urban wages rise. Higher transport costs for the <b>specific</b> <b>good</b> favour rural industrialization but limit the size of the differentiated agricultural sector. {{rural development}}, designation of origin, new economic geography...|$|R
