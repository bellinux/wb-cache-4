40|$|Since 2003 new {{healthcare}} {{reforms have}} been implemented in Turkey. Although, the healthcare system has gone through modifications {{for the past several}} years; there is insufficient research to demonstrate the effects of these changes. This paper aims to address the issues in the <b>supplementary</b> <b>payment</b> systems, which are one of the recent changes of the healthcare system in the country. This study is mainly based on a review of the relevant professional literature, a research and interpretation of <b>supplementary</b> <b>payment</b> in the public hospitals. This is a research as well as an assessment work done in secondary and tertiary care hospitals. Performance based <b>supplementary</b> <b>payment</b> system in public hospitals aims to provide bonuses to health care employees like physicians, nurses, etc. The bonus is given to professionals, who produce the qualified health services based on records by the evaluation of the whole institution. Financing of <b>supplementary</b> <b>payment</b> system in Turkey is mainly based on social security premiums. Consequently, balance of income and expenditures at hospitals is needed to be followed sensitively. According to this study, physicians' productivity has increased but number of patients per physician has decreased. Also, the amount of performance paid to the physician for their specialty has decreased. Physicians like cardiologists can benefit more from the pay for performance system as their work contributions are paid more compared to internist work. Also secondary care hospital staffs were better paid compared to tertiary care hospitals because more critical cases are sent to tertiary care and treatment of such cases are of high cost. The reforms resulted satisfactory and very successful improvement in healthcare performance. The main health indicators are now better than {{at the beginning of the}} transition period. The sustainability of the reform processes will cause further improvement in the near future. The number of treatments per patient is increased not the number of patient and this may cause an escalated demand. Some precaution such as to control referral of a patient to a tertiary care when the care is possible in the secondary care units is needed to be taken. Complicated or critical patients mean great cost to hospital's revolving funds which means less money to the health staff via pay for performance system in secondary and especially tertiary care...|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{the number}} of {{industrial}} disputes fell, while inflation was brought under control. In the lead up to the 1984 budget, unions agreed to a wage/tax trade-off in which they forewent an indexed wage increase {{in return for a}} tax cut geared towards low and middle-income earners. Job protection, family leave, and a standard 38-hour workweek had been extended to most workers, whose living standards were protected via superannuation, social wage improvements, and tax cuts. Union members (and indeed, non-union members who were nonetheless covered by union-negotiated collective agreements) and their families benefited from lower inflation, more jobs, maternity allowances, family leave, trade union education, improved access to education, Medicare, superannuation, higher pensions, occupational health and safety improvements, family income supplements, and regular real wage increases from 1991 onwards (after having fallen under Hawke). Collective bargaining rights were enhanced, while an effective minimum wages system was sustained. By 1991, the lowest paid workers received additional increases through the mechanism of <b>supplementary</b> <b>payments.</b> It is arguable that most Australians were a little better off materially {{on the eve of the}} 1991 recession than in 1983.

5000|$|In November 1391, a {{few months}} after his return to England, Ralph and the Derbyshire landowner, Roger Leche*, offered {{securities}} of £100 on behalf of one Thomas Skelton, who had become involved in a violent dispute with two London fishmongers; and a few days later he performed a similar service when Leche himself was bound over to keep the peace towards another group of citizens. His position as an esquire of the body to Henry of Bolingbroke was formally recognized in the following January when he received an annuity of ten marks, assigned for life by Gaunt from the revenues of Lancashire. It was probably at about this time that the duke permitted him to take an additional five marks annually from the profits of grazing land in the High Peak area of Derbyshire, where his family appears to have exercised some territorial interests. Ralph may, furthermore, already have been drawing a third fee of ten marks p.a. from Daventry in Northamptonshire, awarded expressly for his past and future loyalty to Bolingbroke. While in attendance upon the latter at Court in the following summer and autumn, <b>supplementary</b> <b>payments</b> of £16 6s.1½d. were made to him to cover his expenses, so he clearly derived considerable financial benefit from their association. Bolingbroke embarked on a second journey to Prussia in 1393, accompanied by Ralph and many other of his former companions. The riotous behaviour of the English caused a serious rift with their hosts, and Bolingbroke decided to abandon his plans for a crusade, disband most of his followers, and travel to Jerusalem on a pilgrimage instead. Ralph accompanied him as far as Venice, supervising the distribution of alms and undertaking other personal tasks on his behalf.4 ...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} {{intended}} to identify <b>supplementary</b> <b>payment</b> systems based on performance in health services provided by public hospitals via revolving fund revenues. For this purpose, all relevant legislation about the regulation of performance-based <b>supplementary</b> <b>payment</b> system in health services was examined in detail. Health legislation analysis is exemplified. A simplified method is followed to help physicians and health care workers to grasp the issue in detail with examples. The performance management implemented for additional payments from revolving funds in hospitals is considered as payments given for every procedure performed by physicians and nurses. In fact, only 50 % of the hospitals’ monthly income is distributed according to some conditions, {{no matter how much}} procedure is done. The packages in Health Care Implementation Notification do not include expenses of depreciation, electricity, water, heating and etc. 50 % of the total amount of the revolving fund is multiplied by the hospital’s quality factor; the resulting amount is distributed to health personnel. The average score is taken for all physicians working in the hospital for making an additional payment of performance. Although there are not performance-based payment systems in Family Medicine Center and the Community Health Center yet, in the near future it is expected to be put in practice at least for some applications...|$|R

5000|$|But in 1834, most {{forms of}} aid to the poor were abolished, and this was done with almost {{universal}} support from the intellectual classes, even from the progressive wing. Karl Polanyi writes {{that the reason for}} the broad support was that the leading form of aid in the early 19th century, the Speenhamland system had become detested even by the working class themselves. Speehamland involved <b>supplementary</b> <b>payments</b> to top up wages. Previously, levels of pay were often linked {{to the quality of the}} workman's work. With Speehamland, workers would receive a guaranteed amount; it would sometimes vary, but only with the price of food. With the guaranteed payment, workers would usually find themselves dropping their standards, even if they had previously taken great pride in their workmanship. In some areas, only a small number of the very best workers were able to avoid applying for Speehamland assistance. A saying arose among the working class that [...] "Once on the rates, always on the rates", and the system became increasingly disliked as it was blamed for causing dependency, discouraging good work and was widely perceived to be more helpful to land owners than to workers. For this reason, by the 1830s even progressive intellectuals and opinion formers had switched their views in favour of free market thinking. Polyanyi records that apart from a few aristocrats whose continued support of Speehamland could be dismissed as self-interested (the system helped workers pay high prices for food from the agricultural lands they controlled), the only well known Briton to remain prominently opposed to the free market in the early 1830s was the socialist Robert Owen. In 1832, free market supporters seized political power, and two years later Speehamland was abolished with the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834. Other {{forms of aid}} for the poor, even soup kitchens and hand outs of food from concerned nobles and clerics, were made illegal. With a few exceptions, the only legally available form of aid was the workhouse. Workhouses became far more common after 1834, and conditions were made much more harsh. The principle of [...] "Less eligibility" [...] was established; it held that less food should be available to inmates than they could get outside even with the lowest paid available jobs, and in practice this sometimes meant they were starved.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the role of prospective payment systems in the adoption of new medical technologies across different countries. A literature review was conducted to provide background for the study and guide development of a survey instrument. The survey was disseminated to hospital payment systems experts in 15 jurisdictions. Fifty-one surveys were disseminated, with 34 returned. The surveys returned covered 14 of the 15 jurisdictions invited to participate. The majority (71 %) of countries update the patient classification system and/or payment tariffs {{on an annual basis}} to try to account for new technologies. Use of short-term separate or <b>supplementary</b> <b>payments</b> for new technologies occurs in 79 % of countries to ensure adequate funding and facilitate adoption. A minority (43 %) of countries use evidence of therapeutic benefit and/or costs to determine or update payment tariffs, although it is somewhat more common in establishing short-term payments. The main barrier to using evidence is uncertain or unavailable clinical evidence. Almost three-fourths of respondents believed diagnosis-related group systems incentivize or deter technology adoption, depending on the particular circumstances. Improvements are needed, such as enhanced strategies for evidence generation and linking evidence of value to payments, national and international collaboration and training to improve existing practice, and flexible timelines for short-term payments. Importantly, additional research is needed to understand how different payment policies impact technology uptake as well as quality of care and costs...|$|E
40|$|Against the {{background}} of the Commission's CAP mid-term review proposals to complete the shift from product support to farmer support the Italian government announced strong opposition to any cuts in aid to durum wheat producers. Italy currently produces 3. 5 million tonnes of durum wheat per annum for which it receives € 345 per hectare in subsidies, a total of € 552 million per annum. The mid-term review proposals call for a reduction in the special <b>supplementary</b> <b>payments</b> for durum wheat from 'traditional' areas (all of Italy's durum wheat-producing areas) to € 250 per hectare over a three-year period (and its abolition in 'established areas'). The Italian Minister of Agriculture Gianni Alemanno maintained that this was 'a fundamental issue for Italy not only because the reform will cut Italy's share of the budget, but because it could lead to a transfer of durum wheat production, and related pasta production to other countries'. This he maintained 'would be intolerable'. Comment: The Commission maintains that reform of the durum wheat regime is necessary since each year 1 to 2 million tonnes of durum wheat are used in animal feed and not as an input into pasta production. A modification of the current specific supplementary payment regime is thus held to be essential. Furthermore the EU Court of Auditors has criticised the special supplementary payment system for over-compensating farmers. Italian concerns over durum wheat and pasta production may however be addressed through modification of the proposals for special payments for high quality durum wheat for manufacturing purposes. This would help to ensure the ready availability of durum wheat for pasta production. Italian pasta is increasingly appearing on supermarket shelves in southern Africa indicating that existing cereal sector reforms have already assisted in enhancing the price competitiveness of Italian pasta production on overseas markets.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{one important}} area of social policy; that is, housing which is broadened {{to include the}} income allocation and living standards of low income households in the Auckland region. The study used three focus group discussions with five to seven participants from specific groups of low income households in the cities of Manukau and North Shore to focus ideas and viewpoints. Twelve participants (eight from Manukau City, three from North Shore City and one from Auckland City) took part in interviews, which took between 60 and 90 minutes to complete. These participants represented five single parent and three superannuitant beneficiary households and four low income-working non-beneficiary households who supplemented their low income with <b>supplementary</b> <b>payments</b> from Work and Income New Zealand and Inland Revenue Department. Both the group fora and the interviews were recorded on audiotapes and transcribed. The study used the following measures to ascertain the living standards {{and quality of life}} of the 12 households studied: income and expenditure approach, relative deprivation approaches, disadvantage indicators and social exclusion, money problem indicators, housing needs or difficulties and qualitative research approach. It was found that most of the 12 households studied: • had experienced poverty, hardships and a reduction in their standard of living and quality of life as compared to the average New Zealand household. • were not adequately housed because of the difficulties of housing affordability and unacceptable housing maintenance by Housing New Zealand. Whilst the Accommodation Supplement was assisting most of the 12 households studied to pay housing costs, 11 of the 12 households who were State House tenants had great difficulty in paying market rents. • were unable to manage their money problems and had to rely on coping strategies {{such as the use of}} foodbanks, food vouchers and second hand goods.

40|$|The study {{evaluates the}} changes in {{socio-economic}} equity {{in the use of}} general hospital care in Finland from the late 1980 s to the mid 1990 s. In the early 1990 s the Finnish economy plunged into a deep recession which slashed over 10 % of GDP and resulted in a 12 % decrease in national health expenditure. At the same time, the administration and financing of specialised health services were reformed. The impact on general hospital care was controversial: budgets were reduced but better productivity increased the supply of many services. According to the study, data, based on individual linkage of nationwide hospital registers to disposable family income data in population censuses, overall acute general hospital admission rates among Finns aged 25 - 74 increased by over 10 % from 1988 to 1996. For some surgical procedures, such as cataract, coronary revascularisation and some orthopaedic operations, rates more than doubled. In both years, lower-income groups generally used hospital care more than the better-off. However, there was a slight shift towards a pro-rich distribution, mainly due to a larger increase in surgical care among the high-income groups. In 1988 the lowest income quintile used 8 % and in 1996 15 % fewer operations than the highest. For individual procedures and surgical diagnostic categories, the general trends of increasing disparities were similar. Despite cuts in expenditures in the early 1990 s, the Finnish general hospital system based on public funding and provision managed to increase the supply of services. However, this increase coincided with widening socio-economic discrepancies in the use of surgical services. The paper proposes that these increasing inequities were due to certain features of the Finnish health care system which create social discrepancies in access to hospital care. These include the high profile of the private sector in specialised ambulatory care and in the supply of some elective procedures, and semi-private public hospital services requiring <b>supplementary</b> <b>payments</b> from patients.

40|$|The {{perception}} by Government in 1974 {{of a need}} {{to modify}} fluctuations in farm product prices resulted {{in the establishment of}} the Farm Incomes Advisory Committee (the Zanetti Committee) to investigate and advise Government on ways of reducing product price and farm income fluctuations. This Committee reported early in 1975 and recommended the establishment of price stabilisation schemes to reduce the fluctuations in farm product prices and the establishment of criteria for deciding when Government funded <b>supplementary</b> <b>payments</b> should be made to achieve adequate farm income levels. Following this, Government entered negotiations with the N. Z. Wool Board and N. Z. Meat Producers' Board which resulted in the introduction of price stabilisation schemes during the 1975 / 76 season. These schemes are designed to be market orientated and are administered by the Producer Boards. The Government considered that such market orientated schemes would provide for price stability as well as an adequate level of farm income. However, the operation of the schemes up to the 1977 / 78 season did not result in what the Government considered to be an adequate income level for the encouragement of increased farm production or the level of confidence considered to be necessary for farm production expansion. Therefore, the Government introduced the Supplementary Minimum Prices (SMP) Scheme {{at the start of the}} 1978 / 79 season in order to provide product prices to farmers at a level thought to be appropriate for income adequacy and guaranteed those prices (in nominal terms) for a total of two seasons in order to provide for improved stability and confidence. In subsequent years (up to 1981 / 82), the SMPs generally rose in nominal terms from one season to the next but, in real terms, they fell considerably, tending to reflect a move toward a market price orientation and less emphasis on the income adequacy objective. Over the period from SMP introduction to the start of the 1981 / 82 season, the SMPs were largely ineffective with regard to producer returns as they were either exceeded by market prices or matched by the Producer Board minimum prices (which are based on market expectations). The SMPs announced for the 1981 / 82 season were, however, well ahead of market prices (and the Producer Board minimums) and reflected the expressed objective of Government to provide prices which would result in farmer income adequacy. These prices have resulted in significant <b>supplementary</b> <b>payments</b> to farmers during the 1981 / 82 season. The price levels have been maintained (nominally) for the 1982 / 83 season, reflecting a fall of approximately 18 per cent in real terms and a move back toward a more market level orientation (rather than the maintenance of adequate farm incomes). The impact of such schemes on farm production levels requires examination. Data have been presented that show increased production results from increased land investment, rather than increased total investment. Also, it is apparent that farm income levels are more closely related to other forms of investment (plant, machinery and buildings) than to land investment. Therefore, measures which alter the level of farm income received are likely to have a more significant effect on these other categories of investment than on land investment. This means that farm production levels may not respond directly to farm income changes and the SMP scheme may not result in farm production changes. Also, farm production tends to respond to the relative prices of the various products. Therefore, distortions in the market relativities, which could easily result from the use of SMPs at set product price levels, could lead to production distortions which are not related to the market. It is therefore desirable that agricultural support of a general nature be applied over all products at a similar level either through exchange rate adjustment or the provision of a common percentage increase in market prices rather than through product specific prices. Such assistance would only provide the climate for the encouragement of production increases. In order to ensure that Government funds were used appropriately in ensuring that production increases occurred, such funds should be channeled directly to the production land investment area...|$|E

Method: In this study it is used qualitative analysis methods to explore experienced physicians&# 146; perceptions about the advantages and the disadvantages of PBSP payment system which has been implemented at university hospitals since 2011. The study was carried out by using qualitative research method. Data were collected from semi-structured qualitative interviews with experienced. The study was conducted at a university hospital. Results: The result of the analysis has revealed that PBSP system encourage physicians who would like to receive financial incentives. PBSP system supports the individual performance, reduces waiting times in patients, increases revenues and decreases expenditures and increases in efficiency of department. However, this payment system increases work load, number of examinations and provokes the conflict among personals. Conclusions: University hospitals are academic institutions that perform important missions such as research, medical education and health services provision. Therefore, PBSP system should be revised so as to encourage performing these missions at university hospitals. There is also shortage of financial resources at the university hospitals. This situation leads to less additional payments to physicians. [J Contemp Med 2017; 7 (2. 000) : 126 - 131...|$|R

40|$|To {{address the}} illicit {{cigarette}} trade, the European Union (EU) has signed {{agreements with the}} four major Transnational Tobacco Companies (TTCs) that involve establishing extensive systems of cooperation. All agreements foresee two types of payments: annual payments (totalling US $ 1. 9 billion over 20 years) and <b>supplementary</b> seizure <b>payments,</b> equivalent to 100 % of the evaded taxes {{in the event of}} seizures of their products. While limited by the fundamental lack of transparency in this area, our analysis suggests that these agreements have served largely to secure the TTCs’ interests and are threatening progress in tobacco control. The seizure payments are paltry and a wholly inadequate deterrent to TTC involvement in illicit trade. Despite th...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{experience}} of Armenia with the displacement of more than 7, 000 teachers during 2003 - 07 as part of structural reforms in general education. In addition to <b>supplementary</b> severance <b>payments,</b> a variety of services were needed to address difficulties commonly experienced by displaced employees, including job search assistance and counseling services, provision {{of information on the}} labor market, on legal rights of job seekers, on services and service providers available, including training, relocation assistance, and so forth. The findings of the paper suggest that the staff rationalization program has resulted in significant efficiency gains: the student-teacher ratio increased from 10. 8 in 2003 to 13. 9 in 2006. The considerable reduction in staff positions has allowed the government to significantly increase nominal wages and salaries for teaching and non-teaching staff.

40|$|An initial {{exchange}} of views on the Commission's CAP mid-term review proposals {{took place at the}} Agricultural Council meeting on July 15 th 2002. It was reported that every delegation found some positive elements in the proposals. Indeed, there was broad support for the reinforcement of the EU's rural-development programmes, particularly in the areas of environmental protection, food safety and the promotion of quality production. A number of member states, however, felt that the proposals went beyond the review mandate set out in Berlin in 1999. Indeed 10 of the 14 member states felt that the proposals brought into question the framework for agricultural policy already established up to 2006. The harshest criticism came from France and Spain, with France being particularly concerned over the implications of the US Farm Bill. Belgium, Portugal, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Austria and Finland also found cause for complaint in the proposals. Other member states (Germany, the UK, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands) were more supportive and looked for a more radical approach leading to saving on the EU agricultural budget. Formal Commission legislative proposals regarding specific review proposals will be tabled before the end of 2002 (probably in October) in the following areas: reducing the intervention price for cereals; adjusting the special <b>supplementary</b> <b>payment</b> for durum wheat; reducing the intervention price for rice; further moves towards de-coupling; cross compliance; dynamic modulation; farm auditing; agri-environmental measures; rules on state aids. However, no Council decisions will be made until the spring of 2003. In opening the Council debate Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler argued that the need for change was now urgent and could not simply be postponed until 2006, both because of the need to move forward in the WTO negotiation on agriculture and the need to establish a clear framework for the accession of new EU members.

40|$|The Supplementary Minimum Price {{policy has}} been a major topic of debate in the past few years, but there have been {{relatively}} few attempts to quantify the impacts that the scheme has had on the agricultural sector. Although the level of payments can be readily identified, it is recognised {{to be very difficult to}} evaluate the long term impacts on agricultural investment and development. In this study, an econometric model of the New Zealand pastoral sector is utilised in an attempt to evaluate the short and long run impacts of the removal of the policy. In order to isolate the effects of the SMP policies from other factors which are continuously changing, a simulation experiment was performed. Using 1982 price levels both with and without <b>supplementary</b> minimum <b>payments,</b> the levels of farm investment, farm production, and exports were estimated for a five year period. The comparison of these two simulations made it possible to isolate both the short and long run impacts of the pricing policy. The results suggest that in the short term the main implications of removing <b>supplementary</b> minimum <b>payments</b> would be to decrease both gross and net farm incomes with little change in output or export earnings. Although changing income levels do not affect production in the short term they have implications for agricultural investment and output in the longer term. Similarly, foreign exchange earnings decrease in the long run as agricultural investment diminishes. It is concluded that SMP payments cannot be justified solely on the grounds that without them export receipts would fall dramatically. Also, the analysis shows that the productive capacity of the pastoral sector would not have been seriously run down in the absence of SMP payments, and would have been able to respond to any upturn in market returns. Thus, recent increases in market prices seem not to present an ex post justification for an SMP policy...|$|R
50|$|Also in {{the early}} stages of the movement, Wiley {{rejected}} Cloward and Piven’s strategy of flooding welfare rolls with new welfare recipients and instead favored a strategy of organizing current welfare recipients into pressure groups. Critics of the Cloward-Piven strategy argued that it was easier to create a welfare crisis than to bring about its resolution. Activists, who were mainly welfare recipients themselves with little political power, would be left amidst this crisis with the ability to do nothing about it. This move was also easier organizationally for the movement because it was strategically more difficult to identify those who were eligible for welfare than those who already received it, it was also more difficult to motivate welfare-eligible individuals to act than those who already received it, and it was easier to organize current recipients of welfare by offering them benefits such as <b>supplementary</b> welfare <b>payments.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{fourth floor}} {{extension}} {{on the main}} building applied a simplified reading of the Renaissance Revival style, its flat roof topped off with a large [...] "Hotel Pontresina" [...] sign. Its significantly greater height caused it to tower above the less flamboyantly restyled building beside it. The embellishment elements of the five-section front facade were mostly formed of wood, sheet metal and zinc castings, coated in stone coloured paint. The ground floor contained the reception area and the restaurant, which was open to passing trade {{as well as to}} hotel guests not wishing to spend time and money on a bit meal (so eating [...] "à la carte"). At the back of the building the ground floor also incorporated the kitchens for the restaurant and hotel. Upstairs, the more expensive guest rooms were on the first and second floors, benefitting from the large windows conferred by the remodelled facade on the buildings western (front) face, which provided views over the road towards the Roseg valley and glacier. The two corner rooms were particularly coveted, thanks to the small balconies emerging from the bevelled corner shape of the building. The more modest top floor rooms were provided for guests with less demanding requirements and for the servants accompanying some of the more affluent guests. The 1881 extension left the hotel with a capacity of around 66 beds.On the western face of the building, close to the mountainside, the grand dining room was positioned above the kitchen on the first floor. Its height encompassed both the first and second floors. Guests eating here benefitted from a multi-course menu, albeit without being able to select individually the dishes they wished to be served. Most guests dined at the long banquet style table (the [...] "Table d’hôte"). Main meals were served at fixed times - 13.00 and 19.30 - and guests were politely but firmly informed that when they arrived late they would miss out on those courses that had already been served. ("Herrschaften, die verspätet ankommen, werden mit laufender Platte servier".) For a <b>supplementary</b> <b>payment</b> of 1 Swiss franc (lunch) or 2 Swiss francs (dinner) guests could elect to be served not at the shared long table but at separately assigned small tables.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} poverty within Israel. Against the {{background}} of the history of pre-state Israel and the developments after the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 the historical roots of Israeli poverty are analyzed. Thus the ‘socialist’-Zionist project, ethnic exclusion, religious and intra-Jewish ethnic lines of conflict as well as the Bedouins, Druzes and Israeli Arabs as ‘specific’ Israeli citizen are discussed. Despite the economic growth in Israel since 2003 ‘the majority of Israeli wage earners (over 60 percent) earned less than $ 1, 450 a month last year’ (Goldstein 2007, p. 1). In 2004 1. 3 million Israelis lived below the poverty line, a number which in 2005 increased to more than 1. 5 million Israelis. In spite of growing economic prosperity the proportion of families belonging to the working-poor, i. e. families with at least one family member in paid employment, increased from 11. 4 percent in 2004 to 12. 2 percent in 2005. The percentage of poor families in the working population increased from 40. 6 percent to 43. 1 percent. Nearly 60 percent of the ‘working-poor’ were working fulltime (Sinai 2006 a, Shaoul 2006). 42 percent of Israeli Arab families are living below the poverty line. The average wages are less than half the wages of Ashkenazi Jews. Every second Israeli Arab child lives in poverty. When in 1996 to 2001 the unemployment rate of the Jewish Israelis increased by about 53 percent, the unemployment rate of the Arab Israelis increased by 126 percent (cf. Shaoul 2006). 80 percent of Israelis regard themselves as poor. 23 percent of the pensioners are living below the poverty line. Poverty among children increased in 1988 to 2005 by about 50 percent. Approximately one fifth of all under-age children (714. 000) in Israel are suffering from hunger (cf. Shaoul 2006). 75 percent of the poor families cannot afford medicine and 70 percent are dependant on food donations (cf. Sinai 2005 b). Nearly one third of the Holocaust survivors are living in poverty. Some of the Holocaust survivors get $ 600,- per month from the German government, whilst other Holocaust survivors receive only $ 350,- per month from the Israeli Ministry of Finance and the Holocaust survivors that immigrated to Israel after 1953 (who amount to 70 percent of the Holocaust survivors in Israel) only receive the general national pension. Nearly 20 percent of the Holocaust survivors are at the present time 86 years and older, 70 percent are older than 76 years. (cf. Medina 2007, p. 1) They are not entitled to a <b>supplementary</b> <b>payment</b> or to compensation. But the problematic economic situation of the Holocaust survivors is neither new information nor an unknown fact. As a result of the precarious situation several are in need of the help of welfare organizations, because they cannot afford to some degree their necessary medicine...|$|R
