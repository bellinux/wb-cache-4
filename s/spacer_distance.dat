40|$|AbstractWe {{have used}} the oxidant CuCl 2 to study its effect on {{precursor}} protein import into chloroplasts and on the components involved. CuCl 2 reversibly oxidizes thiol groups, which in turn, can form disulfide bridges. Concentrations of 40 μM CuCl 2 almost completely inhibit precursor protein binding and subsequent translocation into chloroplasts. This inhibitory effect is reversible by a dithiothreitol treatment. Disulfide bridges, which form upon oxidation by CuCl 2, are build up intramolecular and intermolecular, if the thiol groups are in close vicinity to each other. CuCl 2 can thus {{be used as a}} thiol cleavable crosslinker without an additional <b>spacer</b> <b>distance</b> between the two targets. When purified outer envelope membranes were treated with CuCl 2, a hetero oligomeric complex is detected, consisting of OEP 86, OEP 75 and OEP 34, indicating the close vicinity and protein-protein interaction between polypeptides in situ, which are involved in protein translocation into chloroplasts...|$|E

40|$|A {{particular}} interesting plasmonic {{system is}} that of metallic nanostructures interacting with metal films. As the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) behavior of gold nanostructures (Au NPs) {{on the top of}} a gold thin film is exquisitely sensitive to the <b>spacer</b> <b>distance</b> of the film-Au NPs, we investigate in the present work the influence of a few-layered graphene spacer on the LSPR behavior of the NPs. The idea is to evidence the role of few-layered graphene as one of the thinnest possible spacer. We first show that the coupling to the Au film induces a strong lowering at around 507 nm and sharpening of the main LSPR of the Au NPs. Moreover, a blue shift in the main LSP resonance of about 13 nm is observed in the presence of a few-layered graphene spacer when compared to the case where gold nanostructures are directly linked to a gold thin film. Numerical simulations suggest that this LSP mode is dipolar and that the hot spots of the electric field are pushed to the top corners of the NPs, which makes it very sensitive to surrounding medium optical index changes and thus appealing for sensing applications. A figure of merit of such a system (gold/graphene/Au NPs) is 2. 8, as compared to 2. 1 for gold/Au NPs. This represents a 33 % gain in sensitivity and opens-up new sensing strategies...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTGiven {{that the}} {{durability}} of structures {{is directly related to}} the thickness of the cover to reinforcement, it is essential to ensure minimum cover is achieved when building a structure. However, studies show that this is not always the case. One of the reasons for the this problem is the lack of indication, in structural projects, of the positioning of spacers. This situation is compounded by the lack of standards and regulations on the use of spacers (i. e. minimum quantities and required layout). This study assesses three different <b>spacer</b> <b>distances</b> and two different tying distances in order to examine the influence of these factors in the cover to reinforcement.

40|$|In {{the current}} context of rapidly {{depleting}} petroleum resources and growing environmental concerns, {{it is important}} to develop materials to harvest and store energy from renewable and sustainable sources. Hydrogen {{has the potential to be}} an alternative energy source, since it has higher energy content than petroleum. However, since hydrogen has very low volumetric energy density, hence {{it is important to}} design nano porous materials which can efficiently store large volumes of hydrogen gas by adsorption. In this regard carbon nanotube and Metal Organic Framework (MOFs) based materials are worth studying. Ionic liquids (IL) are potential electrolytes that can improve energy storage capacity and safety in Li ion batteries. Therefore it is important to understand IL's thermodynamic and transport properties, especially when it is in contact with electrode surface and mixed with Li salt, as happens in the battery application. This dissertation presents computation and simulation based studies on: 1. Hydrogen storage in carbon nanotube scaffold. 2. Mechanical property and stability of various nanoporous Metal Organic Frameworks. 3. Thermodynamic and transport properties of [BMIM][BF 4] ionic liquid in bulk, in Li Salt mixture, on graphite surface and under nanoconfinement.

40|$|Fusion of {{cervical}} spine in kyphotic alignment {{has been}} proven to produce an acceleration of degenerative changes at adjacent levels. Stand-alone cages are reported to have a relatively high incidence of implant subsidence with secondary kyphotic deformity. This malalignment may theoretically lead to adjacent segment disease in the long term. The prospective study analysed possible risk factors leading to cage subsidence with resulting sagittal malalignment of cervical spine. Radiographic data of 100 consecutive patients with compressive radiculo-/myelopathy due to degenerative disc prolapse or osteophyte formation were prospectively collected in those who were treated by anterior cervical discectomy and implantation of single type interbody fusion cage. One hundred and forty four implants were inserted altogether at one or two levels as stand-alone cervical spacers without any bone graft or graft substitute. All patients underwent standard anterior cervical discectomy and the interbody implants were placed under fluoroscopy guidance. Plain radiographs were obtained on postoperative days one and three to verify position of the implant. Clinical and radiographic follow-up data were obtained at 6  weeks, 3 and 6  months and than annually in outpatient clinic. Radiographs were evaluated with respect to existing subsidence of implants. Subsidence was defined as more than 2  mm reduction in segmental height due to implant migration into the adjacent end-plates. Groups of subsided and non-subsided implants were statistically compared with respect to <b>spacer</b> <b>distance</b> to the anterior rim of vertebral body, spacer versus end-plate surface ratio, amount of bone removed from adjacent vertebral bodies during decompression and pre- versus immediate postoperative intervertebral space height ratio. There were 18 (18 %) patients with 19 (13. 2 %) subsided cages in total. No patients experienced any symptoms. At 2  years, there was no radiographic evidence of accelerated adjacent segment degeneration. All cases of subsidence occurred at the anterior portion of the implant: 17 cases into the inferior vertebra, 1 into the superior and 1 into both vertebral bodies. In most cases, the process of implant settling started during the perioperative period and its progression did not exceed three postoperative months. There was an 8. 7 ° average loss of segmental lordosis (measured by Cobb angle). Average distance of subsided intervertebral implants from anterior vertebral rim {{was found to be}} 2. 59  mm, while that of non-subsided was only 0. 82  mm (P <  0. 001). Spacer versus end-plate surface ratio was significantly smaller in subsided implants (P <  0. 001). Ratio of pre- and immediate postoperative height of the intervertebral space did not show significant {{difference between the two groups}} (i. e. subsided cages were not in overdistracted segments). Similarly, comparison of pre- and postoperative amount of bone mass in both adjacent vertebral bodies did not show a significant difference. Appropriate implant selection and placement appear to be the key factors influencing cage subsidence and secondary kyphotisation of box-shaped, stand-alone cages in anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. Mechanical support of the implant by cortical bone of the anterior osteophyte and maximal cage to end-plate surface ratio seem to be crucial in the prevention of postoperative loss of lordosis. Our results were not able to reflect the importance of end-plate integrity maintenance; the authors would, however, caution against mechanical end-plate damage. Intraoperative overdistraction was not shown to be a significant risk factor in this study. The significance of implant subsidence in acceleration of degenerative changes in adjacent segments remains to be evaluated during a longer follow-up...|$|E

In this paper we show for the first time that a replicating vector can been used to express foreign genes other than antibiotic resistance genes in Acholeplasma laidlawii. Plasmids derived from the lactococcal vector pNZ 18 could introduce and maintain four different genes for many generations in A. laidlawii. One of these, encoding the dominant membrane lipoprotein spiralin from the mollicute Spiroplasma citri, was expressed; however, expression was weak, the signal peptide of spiralin was not cleaved and the protein was not covalently modified by fatty acids. This resulted in a hydrophilic character of spiralin and its cytoplasmic localization in A. laidlawii. To increase the expression of foreign genes, random A. laidlewii DNA fragments were cloned into a pNZl 8 -related plasmid and expression signals were selected using the Bacillus licheniformis a-amylase gene as a probe.

For arrays containing the same chromophores, the EET rate constant was determined from the reorientational dynamics of the transition dipole using the crossed grating technique. EET time constants ranging from 150 ps up to 33 ns were measured, depending on the distance between the chromophores and on the metal ion complexed in the porphyrins. For the trimeric planar arrays, the interchromophoric distance varies by a factor of 2, while the ratio of the through space to through bond distances is constant. By comparing the measured EET rate constants with those calculated using Förster theory, the contributions of the Coulombic, through space, mechanism and of the exchange, through bond, mechanism could be estimated. For the arrays with the shortest <b>spacer</b> (through space <b>distance</b> of 23 Å), EET occurs through both exchange and Coulombic interactions with a ratio of about 3 : 1.

In this paper, the aggregation behavior of gemini surfactants is examined {{on the basis of}} a free energy model developed by extending our theory for conventional surfactants. Free energy contributions beyond those considered for conventional surfactants arise because of the spacer. They originate from the fact that (a) the spacer shields the hydrophobic core of the aggregate from contact with water, (b) the <b>spacer</b> constrains the <b>distance</b> between the head groups, thus imposing non-unifor-mity in charge distribution at the aggregate surface, (c) the spacer prevents the two linked tails from having a packing conformation inside the micelle identical to that of analogous unlinked single chain surfactants, and (d) the spacer can be partially buried inside the micelle core provided its length and the molecular interactions allow it.

Materials and Methods: Ten cervical vertebrae from C 3 to C 7 with a total of 20 facets were evaluated by the author. The anatomic parameters studied were the height, width, thickness, shape, orientation, and inclination of each of the superior and inferior facets. The alterations in a number of intervertebral segmental distances were measured before and after <b>spacer</b> insertion. The <b>distance</b> of the inferior facet from the foramen tranversarium, spinal canal, and neural foramina was measured to assess safety of spacer insertion with respect to the vertebral artery and neural structures. Results: The height, width and thickness of the superior facets from C 3 to C 7 ranged from 6 to 12 mm, 8 to 12 mm, and 2. 5 to 6 mm, respectively. The inferior facets had an average height of 10. 5 mm, average width of 11. 2 mm and average thickness of 3. 5 mm. The inclination of the superior facets with respect to the transverse plane ranged from 22 ° to 45 ° and that of the inferior facets ranged from 29 ° to 53 °. The distance of the anterior margin of the inferior facet from the posterior border of the foramen transversium ranged from 5 to 7 mm. This distance was maximum at C 3 level, then decreased at C 4 and remained constant from C 5 to C 7. Conclusion: This anatomic evaluation aided in understanding the morphology of the cervical facets and the suitability of the cervical facetal articular cavity for insertion of spacers...|$|R
40|$|Two metallacyclic {{complexes}} {{of general}} formula Na- 8 [(M 2 L 3) -L-II]center dot xH(2) O [M = Ni (4) and Co (5) with x = 15 (4) and 17 (5) ] have been self-assembled {{in aqueous solution}} from N,N'- 1, 3 -phenylenebis(oxamic acid) (H 4 L) and M 2 + ions in a ligand/metal molar ratio of 3 : 2 {{in the presence of}} NaOH acting as base. X-Ray structural analyses of 4 and 5 show triple-stranded, dinuclear anions of the meso-helicate-type (so-called mesocates) with C- 3 h molecular symmetry. The two octahedral metal-tris(oxamate) moieties of opposite chiralities (Delta, Lambda form) are connected by three m-phenylene <b>spacers</b> at intermetallic <b>distances</b> of 6. 822 (2) (4) and 6. 868 (2) angstrom (5) to give a metallacryptand core. In the crystal lattice, the binding of these heterochiral dinickel(II) and dicobalt(II) triple mesocates to sodium(I) ions leads to oxamato-bridged heterobimetallic three-dimensional open-frameworks with a hexagonal diamond architecture having small pores of 17. 566 (4) (4) and 17. 640 (2) angstrom (5) in diameter where the crystallization water molecules and the sodium(I) countercations are hosted. Variable temperature (2. 0 - 300 K) magnetic susceptibility measurements reveal relatively anisotropic S = 2 Ni- 2 (II) (4) and S = 3 Co- 2 (II) (5) ground states resulting from the moderate to weak intramolecular ferromagnetic coupling between the two high-spin Ni-II (S-Ni = 1) or Co-II (S-Co = 3 / 2) ions across the m-phenylenediamidate bridges [J = + 3. 6 (4) and + 1. 1 cm(- 1) (5); H = -JS(1) center dot S- 2]. A simple molecular orbital analysis of the electron exchange interaction identifies the p-type pathways of the meta-substituted phenylene spacers involving the d(z 2) and d(x 2 -y 2) pairs of magnetic orbitals of the two trigonally distorted octahedral high-spin M-II ions (M = Ni and Co) as responsible for the overall ferromagnetic coupling observed in 4 and 5 in agreement with a spin polarization mechanism. The decrease of the overall ferromagnetic coupling from 4 to 5 is in turn explained by the additional antiferromagnetic exchange contribution involving the d(xy) pair of magnetic orbitals of the two trigonally distorted octahedral high-spin Co-II ions across the sigma-type pathway of the meta-substituted phenylene spacers.
