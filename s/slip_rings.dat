25|$|A doubly-fed motor {{allows for}} a smaller {{electronic}} converter {{but the cost of}} the rotor winding and <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> may offset the saving in the power electronics components. Difficulties with controlling speed near synchronous speed limit applications.|$|E
40|$|A {{phase lock}} servo system is {{described}} for synchronizing {{the rotation of}} a <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> assembly with the rotation of an air bearing table so that a minimum of torque will be imparted through cables extending from the <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> assembly to the air bearing table as such is rotated. The system includes two servo loops. The first servo loop includes a rate gyroscope carried on the air bearing table which generates a signal through a summing junction to be compared with a signal coming from a tachometer coupled to the <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> assembly. The corrective signal is applied to a torque motor for rotating the <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> assembly. The second servo loop includes a pair of photo detector cells which generate pulses responsive to {{the rotation of the}} air bearing table and <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> assembly which are fed through a phase detector, and a variable gain amplifier to the summing junction circuit to provide a fine adjustment for rotating the <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> assembly...|$|R
25|$|A DC motor {{is usually}} {{supplied}} through <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> commutator as described above. AC motors' commutation {{can be either}} <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> commutator or externally commutated type, can be fixed-speed or variable-speed control type, and can be synchronous or asynchronous type. Universal motors can run on either AC or DC.|$|R
40|$|A <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> unit is {{required}} in a novel hybrid electric vehicle drive system, called the Four Quadrant Transducer, for transferring AC currents to the rotating windings of an electrical machine [1]-[3]. Component compactness, cost effectiveness and reliability are of vital importance in vehicles, especially for passenger cars. Therefore, {{it is crucial to}} define the characteristics of <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> units to be able to optimise the design for this special application with a relatively short expected lifetime compared with industrial drives. This paper describes the measured performance of three different <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> units...|$|R
25|$|In a WRIM, {{the rotor}} winding {{is made of}} many turns of {{insulated}} wire and is connected to <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> on the motor shaft. An external resistor or other control devices can be connected in the rotor circuit. Resistors allow control of the motor speed, although significant power is dissipated in the external resistance. A converter can be fed from the rotor circuit and return the slip-frequency power {{that would otherwise be}} wasted back into the power system through an inverter or separate motor-generator.|$|E
25|$|The first {{attempts}} to use standard-frequency single-phase AC {{were made in}} Hungary {{as far back as}} 1923, by the Hungarian Kálmán Kandó on the line between Budapest-Nyugati and Alag, using 16kV at 50Hz. The locomotives carried a four-pole rotating phase converter feeding a single traction motor of the polyphase induction type at 600 to 1,100V. The number of poles on the 2,500hp motor could be changed using <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> to run at one of four synchronous speeds. The tests were a success so, from 1932 until the 1960s, trains on the Budapest-Hegyeshalom line (towards Vienna) regularly used the same system. A few decades after the Second World War, the 16kV was changed to the Russian and later French 25kV system.|$|E
25|$|A {{synchronous}} {{electric motor}} is an AC motor distinguished by a rotor spinning with coils passing magnets {{at the same}} rate as the AC and resulting in a magnetic field that drives it. Another way of saying this is that it has zero slip under usual operating conditions. Contrast this with an induction motor, which must slip to produce torque. One type of synchronous motor is like an induction motor except the rotor is excited by a DC field. <b>Slip</b> <b>rings</b> and brushes are used to conduct current to the rotor. The rotor poles connect to each other and move at the same speed hence the name synchronous motor. Another type, for low load torque, has flats ground onto a conventional squirrel-cage rotor to create discrete poles. Yet another, such as made by Hammond for its pre-World War II clocks, and in the older Hammond organs, has no rotor windings and discrete poles. It is not self-starting. The clock requires manual starting by a small knob on the back, while the older Hammond organs had an auxiliary starting motor connected by a spring-loaded manually operated switch.|$|E

40|$|The Seasat {{spacecraft}} failed on October 9, 1978, after satisfactory {{operation in}} orbit for 105 days, {{as a result}} of a loss of electrical power in the Agena bus that was used as a part of the spacecraft. This loss of power was caused by a massive and progressive short in one of the <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> assemblies that was used to connect the rotating solar arrays into the power subsystem. The most likely cause of this short was the initiation of an arc between adjacent <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> brush assemblies. The triggering mechanism of this arc could have been either a wire-to-brush assembly contact, a brush-to-brush contact, or a momentary short caused by a contaminant that bridged internal components of opposite electrical polarity. The <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> assembly, as used in the Seasat spacecraft, was connected into the power subsystem in such a way that most of the adjacent brush assemblies were of opposite electrical polarity. This wiring arrangement, together with the congested nature of the design itself, made the Seasat <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> assembly a unique, first-of-a-kind component that was particularly prone to shorting. The possibility of <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> failures resulting from placing opposite electrical polarities on adjacent brush assemblies was known at least as early-as the summer of 1977 to other projects within the contractor's organization. Furthermore, failures of <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> assemblies due to shorting between brushes had been experienced by the prime contractor on <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> assemblies used by other programs. That the Seasat organization was not fully aware of these potential failure modes was due to a breakdown in communication within the contractor's organization...|$|R

The {{primary and secondary}} coils are preferably magnetically coupled together, in a highly reliable efficient manner, by a magnetic layered core. One of the secondary and primary coils is rotatable and the contactless magnetic <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> provides a substantially constant output...|$|R
50|$|This {{mechanism}} is intended {{as an alternative}} to the usual method of supplying electric power to a rotating device, the use of <b>slip</b> <b>rings.</b> The <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> are attached to one part of the machine, and a set of fine metal brushes are attached to the other part. The brushes are kept in sliding contact with the <b>slip</b> <b>rings,</b> providing an electrical path between the two parts while allowing the parts to rotate about each other.|$|E
50|$|Traditional {{electrical}} commutators use <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> for coupling. <b>Slip</b> <b>rings</b> however inject commutator noise {{into the}} connection. This is because as the contact points slide {{over the surface}} of the slip-rings they make microscopic bumps. The resultant variation in resistance and inductance causes electrical noise in the circuit. To reduce the electrical noise the contact points need to be pressed against the <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> with greater force. This leads to great resistance and a higher rate of wear.|$|E

In this example, the <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> have a brush-lifting device and a sliding contact bar, allowing the slip-rings to be short-circuited when no longer required.

There are different types of generators {{that can be used}} for wind energy generation, among which <b>Slip</b> <b>ring</b> Induction generator proves to be more advantageous. To analyse application of <b>Slip</b> <b>ring</b> Induction generator for wind power generation, an experimental model is developed and results are studied. As power generation from natural sources is the need today and variable speed wind energy is ample in amount in India, it is necessary to study more beneficial options for wind energy generating techniques.

50|$|Wireless <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> do {{not rely}} on the typical {{friction}} based metal and carbon brush contact methods that have been employed by <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> since their invention, such as those explored above. Instead, they transfer both power and data wirelessly via an electromagnetic field, which is created by the coils that are placed in the rotating receiver, and the stationary transmitter. Wireless <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> are considered an upgrade from - or alternative to - traditional <b>slip</b> <b>rings,</b> as their lack of standard mechanical rotating parts means they're typically more resilient in harsh operating environments, and require less maintenance and upkeep. However, the amount of power that can be transmitted between coils is limited; typically a traditional contact-type slip ring can transmit orders of magnitude more power in the same volume.|$|E

50|$|Some {{other names}} used for slip ring are {{collector}} ring, rotary electrical contact and electrical slip ring. Some people {{also use the}} term commutator; however, commutators are somewhat different and are specialized for use on DC motors and generators. While commutators are segmented, <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> are continuous, and the terms are not interchangeable. Rotary transformers are often used instead of <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> in high-speed or low-friction environments.|$|E
50|$|DFIG for Double Fed Induction Generator, a {{generating}} principle {{widely used}} in wind turbines. It {{is based on an}} induction generator with a multiphase wound rotor and a multiphase <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> assembly with brushes for access to the rotor windings. It is possible to avoid the multiphase <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> assembly (see brushless doubly-fed electric machines), but there are problems with efficiency, cost and size. A better alternative is a brushless wound-rotor doubly-fed electric machine.|$|R
50|$|The {{revolving}} part of alternators {{can be the}} armature or the magnetic field. The revolving armature type has the armature wound on the rotor, where the winding moves through a stationary magnetic field. The revolving armature type is not often used. The revolving field type has magnetic field on the rotor to rotate through a stationary armature winding. The advantage is that then the rotor circuit carries much less power than the armature circuit, making the <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> connections smaller and less costly; only two contacts are needed for the direct-current rotor, whereas often a rotor winding has three phases and multiple sections which would each require a <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> connection. The stationary armature can be wound for any convenient medium voltage level, up {{to tens of thousands}} of volts; manufacture of <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> connections for more than a few thousand volts is costly and inconvenient.|$|R

40|$|An {{actuation}} {{method for}} the experimental investigation of compressor rotor blade vibrations is demonstrated. Three blades of the first compressor stage in a two-stage low-speed axial-flow compressor have been equipped with piezo-electric actuators, i. e. macro fiber composites (MFC). For measuring the actuated blade vibrations, strain gages are used. The control system which has been developed within this project allows to pre-set a vibration amplitude of the blade tip. The transmission of the actuation voltage of up to 1000 V into the rotor is accomplished by a <b>slip</b> <b>ring.</b> A <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> is also used for transmitting the strain gage signals. The tests in the rotating machine show that the forces induced by MFCs are large enough to cause sufficiently strong vibrations. The signal quality of the data transmission via <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> is high enough to operate the control unit that allows actuating the rotor blades up to a pre-defined vibration amplitude when matching the lower eigen modes of the blades...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} here a simple, cost-effective apparatus {{for continuous}} tethered electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring of spontaneous recurrent seizures in mice. We used a small, low torque <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> as an EEG commutator, mounted the <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> onto a standard mouse cage and connected rotary wires of the <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> directly to animal's implanted headset. Modifications {{were made in}} the cage to allow for a convenient installation of the <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> and accommodation of animal ambient activity. We tested the apparatus for hippocampal EEG recordings in adult C 57 black mice. Spontaneous recurrent seizures were induced using extended hippocampal kindling (≥ 95 daily stimulation). Control animals underwent similar hippocampal electrode implantations but no stimulations were given. Combined EEG and webcam monitoring were performed for 24 h daily for 5 – 9 consecutive days. During the monitoring periods, the animals moved and accessed water and food freely and showed no apparent restriction in ambient cage activities. Ictal-like hippocampal EEG discharges and concurrent convulsive behaviors that are characteristics of spontaneous recurrent seizures were reliably recorded in a majority of the monitoring experiments in extendedly kindled but not in control animals. However, 1 – 2 rotary wires were disconnected from the implanted headset in some animals after continuous recordings for ≥ 5 days. The key features and main limitations of our recording apparatus are discussed...|$|R

50|$|Encryption {{itself was}} {{provided}} through a single half-rotor; input contacts were through <b>slip</b> <b>rings,</b> {{each of which}} connected to a single output contact on the rotor. Since both the vowels and consonants were passed through the same rotor, it had sixty contacts (the least common multiple of six and twenty); wiring ensured that {{the two groups were}} kept separate. The <b>slip</b> <b>rings</b> were connected to the input keyboard through a plugboard; again this was organized to keep the vowels and consonants separate.|$|E
50|$|Compared to a {{squirrel-cage}} rotor, {{the rotor}} of the <b>slip</b> <b>ring</b> motor has more winding turns; the induced voltage is then higher, {{and the current}} lower, than for a squirrel-cage rotor. During the start-up a typical rotor has 3 poles connected to the <b>slip</b> <b>ring.</b> Each pole is wired in series with a variable power resistor. When the motor reaches full speed the rotor poles are switched to short circuit. During start-up the resistors reduce the field strength at the stator. As a result the inrush current is reduced. Another important advantage over squirrel-cage motors is higher starting torque.|$|R
