40|$|The {{effects of}} {{corticosteroid}} given in vivo on human lymphocyte subpopulation function were investigated using an in vitro system of pokeweek mitogen-stimulated immunoglobulin production. Peripheral blood lymphocytes {{were obtained from}} normal volunteers before and 4 h after the intravenous administration of methylprednisolone. Unfractioned peripheral blood lymphocytes showed a consistent decrease (mean ≅ 50 %) in immunoglobulin and total protein synthesis after steroid administration. Utilizing separated thymus-derived (T) and bone marrow-derived (B) lymphocyte fractions, the pathophysiology of this alteration in immunoglobulin production was elucidated. B lymphocytes obtained after steroid treatment showed a markedly diminished immunoglobulin response (20 % of normal) to normal T lymphocytes and to normal T cells that had been irradiated to remove <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> function. All major classes of immunoglobulin (IgG, IgM, and IgA) were affected. T lymphocytes procured after steroid administration were capable of providing normal amounts of T cell help for B cells in immunoglobulin production. However, <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> activity, observed with normal T lymphocytes at high T to B cell ratios, was absent from the post-steroid T lymphocytes. This loss of <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> function was not due {{to the presence of}} excess help as irradiated pre- and poststeroid T cells provided equal amounts of helper activity. On recombining the poststeroid treatment B cells, which are hyporesponsive in immunoglobulin synthesis, with the posttreatment T lymphocytes, which lack suppressor activity, diminished amounts of immunoglobulin were produced which correlate well with the effects observed with unseparated cells. Thus, corticosteroids have differential effects on the lymphocyte populations involved in immunoglobulin biosynthesis. B cell responsiveness is diminished, <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> activity is removed, and helper T lymphocyte function is unaffected...|$|E
40|$|Newly formed hepatic granulomas around Schistosoma mansoni eggs become {{progressively}} smaller {{during the}} chronic (greater {{than or equal}} to 15 weeks after infection) phase of the disease. This reduction in granuloma size, termed "modulation," is known to be caused in part by a T lymphocyte that can adoptively transfer modulation to 6 -week-infected mice. The present study examines a possible role for the I-J locus in regulating the <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> aspects of modulation. Adoptive transfer between congeneic B 10. A(3 R) and B 10. A(5 R) mice (differing at the I-J locus) indicated that optimal suppression is dependent upon homology at the I-J locus. In vivo treatment of chronically infected mice with microliter amounts of antiserum specific for the recipient's I-J determinant blocked modulation during chronic infection and prevented adoptive transfer of suppression to 6 -week-infected mice. The in vivo regimen of anti-I-J had no effect on anti-schistosomal egg antigen titers during chronic infection. These results demonstrate an I-J restriction for suppression. It appears that the <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> circuit responsible for this aspect of modulation requires an I-J positive lymphocyte...|$|E

40|$|Mitogen-induced <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> {{function}} was evaluated {{in patients with}} chronic active hepatitis (CAH). The in vitro effect of the biological response modifier, thymosin fraction 5, on the suppressive activity of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBM) was aiso assessed. Suppressor cell activity was significantly decreased inpatients with CAH when compared to controls (P < 0. 001). In the absence of the inducing mitogen, thymosin-treated PBM from both patients and controls promoted enhancement of tritiated thymidine uptake by cocultured allogeneic lymphocytes. When thymosin-treated mononuclear Cells were mitogen-activated; patients, but not the controls, showed a marked increase in suppressor activity (P < 0. 001). These results indicate that the polypeptides contained in thymosin fraction 5 can promote a helper effect in patients and controls. Furthermore, PBM from patients with CAH contain a subset of lymphocytes that can express a suppressive function following thymosin treatment. We conclude that thymosin fraction 5 can promote an in vitro restoration of suppressor T cell function in patients with CAH. Chronic active hepatitis (CAH) represents he his...|$|E
40|$|In the {{preceding}} paper {{of this series}} (1), it was demonstrated that surface immunoglobulin (sIg) 1 - bearing, Lyt 1 - 2 - 3 - (B) lymphocytes, once triggered by antigen (sheep erythrocytes [SRBC]) {{in the presence of}} T cells, could exert potent specific suppressive effects on primary in vitro responses. A variety of B cell- and/or Igassociated mechanisms might account for this effect. Recent studies by others have shown that auto-anti-idiotypic antibodies formed early during immune responses can suppress humoral immunity at the plaque-forming-cell (PFC) level (2, 3). Earlier studies have revealed that either anti-antigen antibodies, through interference with cellular recognition of antigenic determinants (classical antibody feedback) (4, 5), or heterologous anti-idiotypic antibodies, via receptor blockade (6) or <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> (T,) induction (6 - 8), can reduce humoral immune responses.

40|$|The {{effect of}} human {{interferon}} alpha on the differentiation of functional populations of lymphocytes during the human allogeneic response in vitro was studied. Interferon alpha inhibited {{the generation of}} allospecific <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> that normally develop from lymphocytes primed in vitro against allogeneic cells. This effect was {{not the result of}} the destruction by interferon of precursor suppressor cells but rather to inhibition of their differentiation into active <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> This inhibition was reversible and could be overcome by repeated allogeneic stimulation even in the presence of interferon. Inhibition of the generation of allospecific suppressor lymphocytes by interferon might {{play an important role in}} the allogeneic response. Interferon inhibited the proliferation of lymphocytes after allogeneic stimulation in a primary mixed lymphocyte reaction but enhanced their cytotoxicity. Despite the inhibitory effect in the primary mixed lymphocyte reaction, the specific secondary proliferative response of lymphocytes primed against a single HLA-DR antigen was only slightly affected by interferon. On the other hand, the nonspecific secondary proliferative response of lymphocytes primed in the presence of interferon was significantly reduced, indicating that interferon might decrease the recruitment of nonspecific "irrelevant" clones of responding cells during the sensitization period...|$|R
40|$|The {{participation}} of cell-mediated mechanisms in the immunoregulation of acute pulmonary inflammation {{was investigated in}} strain 2 and strain 13 guinea pigs. These two strains differ only with respect to those genes which control immune responsiveness. The acute inflammatory response, elicited in the guinea pig lung by a protocol of immunization and aerosol challenge with ovalbumin, was evaluated at 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours postchallenge. Both strains manifest a characteristic influx of inflammatory cells into the lungs as well as pulmonary edema and hemorrhage. Inflammatory injury, as assessed by histological evaluation, cell recovery from the lung {{and the proportion of}} macrophages in the bronchoalveolar lavage cell population, is maximal at 24 hours postchallenge in both strains, and is still evident at 96 hours postchallenge in strain 2 guinea pigs. Acute inflammation is of shorter duration in the lungs of strain 13 guinea pigs. A role for cellular immune responses to inhaled antigen was suggested by the antigen-specific blastogenesis of bronchoalveolar lavage T lymphocytes. Strain 2 bronchoalveolar lavage T cells exhibited a biphasic proliferative response to ovalbumin that was not observed in peripheral blood. The decreased blastogenic response to ovalbumin at 72 hours postchallenge was associated with functional activity of an antigen-specific <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> recovered from the lung at this postchallenge time. This suppressor cell population was shortlived in vitro, histamine type II receptor-positive, Ia antigen-positive, and could be induced by preincubation in the presence of antigen. In contrast, ovalbumin-induced blastogenesis of strain 13 guinea pig bronchoalveolar lavage T cells was significantly (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) elevated only at 72 hours postchallenge, coincident with the resolution of disease. A <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> could be recovered from the strain 13 lung at 24 through 96 hours postchallenge, and activation of a cellular histamine type II receptor was not critical for expression of function. Peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar cell proliferative responses to antigen and mitogen were more closely parallel in strain 13 guinea pigs. Alveolar macrophages may interact with other cellular immune reactants present in the lung, thereby assuming {{a central role in the}} mediation of inflammation. The increased expression of Ia antigens by strain 2 alveolar macrophages throughout the course of disease may facilitate antigen presentation, contributing to maintenance of the inflammatory state. Alternatively, prostaglandin production by alveolar macrophages may be partially responsible for resolution of disease. (Abstract shortened with permission of author. ...|$|E
40|$|Cimetidine, a H 2 {{receptor}} antagonist, {{has been}} reported to improve survival in gastrointestinal cancer patients. These effects have largely been attributed to the enhancing effects of cimetidine on the host's antitumour cell-mediated immune response, such as inhibition of <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> activity, stimulation of natural killer cell activity and increase of interleukin- 2 production from helper T lymphocytes. We conducted an in vitro study on the effects of cimetidine on differentiation and antigen presenting capacity of monocyte-derived dendritic cells from advanced colorectal cancer patients and normal controls. As a result, an investigation of expression of surface molecules associated with dendritic cells by flow cytometric analyses showed that cimetidine had no enhancing effect on differentiation of dendritic cells from cancer patients and normal controls. An investigation of [3 H]thymidine incorporation by allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reactions revealed that cimetidine increased the antigen presenting capacity of dendritic cells from both materials. Moreover, a higher antigen presenting capacity was observed in advanced cancer patients compared to normal controls. These effects might be mediated via specific action of cimetidine and not via H 2 receptors because famotidine did not show similar effects. Our results suggest that cimetidine may enhance the host's antitumour cell-mediated immunity by improving the suppressed dendritic cells function of advanced cancer patients...|$|E
40|$|Sixty-five {{patients}} with recrudescent orofacial {{herpes simplex virus}} (HSV) infections all had circulating HSV-specific antibody measured by ELISA and cell-mediated immunity (CMI) to HSV by in vitro lymphoproliferation. Thirteen control subjects with no history of HSV were negative for both tests. Thirty-three patients, repeatedly investigated during 6 to 38 months, had between 1 and 8 recrudescences each. Lymphoproliferative responses to HSV were low during recrudescence, rose to a peak {{a few weeks later}} and then declined to a positive background level. However, ELISA titres and lymphoproliferative responses to concanavalin A were high throughout, and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) subset numbers measured by fluorescent flow cytometry remained within normal limits. During HSV lesions, depressed lymphoproliferation to HSV was abrogated by removal of CD 8 + T cells from PBMC either by using a panning technique (nine patients) or by cell sorting (three patients). Reconstitution of the CD 8 -depleted population suppressed the lymphoproliferative response to HSV. Depletion of CD 8 + T cells did not affect lymphoproliferation to HSV outwith recrudescence (four patients), nor lymphoproliferative responses to another antigen (PPD; five patients) during recrudescence. Thus, reduced lymphoproliferation to HSV during recrudescence may be due to HSV-specific CD 8 + <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> function, rather than lack of HSV-responsive lymphocytes. This may result in depression of normal CMI responses to the virus during an asymptomatic recurrence allowing recrudescent lesions to develop...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{condition was}} established in vivo for selectively eliminating hapten-reactive suppressor T-cell activity generated in mice primed with a para-azobenzoate (PAB) -mouse gamma globulin (MGG) -conjugate and treated with PAB-nonimmunogenic copolymer of D-amino acids (D- glutamic acid and D-lysine; D-GL). The elimination of suppressor T-cell activity with PAB-D-GL treatment from the mixed populations of hapten- reactive <b>suppressor</b> and helper <b>T</b> cells substantially increased apparent helper T-cell activity. Moreover, the inhibition of PAB-reactive suppressor T-cell generation by the pretreatment with PAB-D-GL before the PAB-MGG-priming increased the development of PAB-reactive helper T-cell activity. The analysis of hapten-specificity of helper T cells revealed that the reactivity of helper cells developed {{in the absence of}} <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> cells was more specific for primed PAB-determinants and their cross-reactivities to structurally related determinants such as meta-azobenzoate (MAB) significantly decreased, as compared with the helper T-cell population developed in the presence of <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes.</b> In addition, those helper T cells generated in the absence of <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> cells were highly susceptible to tolerogenesis by PAB-D- GL. Similarly, the elimination of <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> also enhanced helper T-cell activity in a polyclonal fashion in the T-T cell interactions between benzylpenicilloyl (BPO) -reactive T cells and PAB- reactive T cells after immunization of mice with BPO-MGG-PAB. Thus inhibition of BPO-reactive suppressor T-cell development by the BPO-v-GL- pretreatment resulted in augmented generation of PAB-reactive helper T cells with higher susceptibility of tolerogenesis to PAB-D-GL. Thus, these results support the notion that <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> cells eventually suppress helper T-cell activity and indicate that the function of <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> cells related to helper T-cell development is to inhibit the increase in the specificity and apparent affinity of helper T cells in the primary immune response. The hapten-reactive <b>suppressor</b> and helper <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> are considered as a model system of T cells that regulate the immune response, and the potential applicability of this system to manipulating various T cell-mediated immune responses is discussed in this context...|$|R
40|$|Paracoccidioidomycosis is an endemic {{fungal disease}} widely {{distributed}} throughout Latin America.

Inbred male Buffalo/Sim rats weighing 250 - 300 g were inoculated with 5 x 10 (6) P. brasiliensis cells of the yeast phase form by intracardiac route. One group of animals was treated with 20 mg/kg body weight at days + 4, + 5, + 6, + 7, + 11 and + 12 post-infection (pi.), while a control group was infected alone. No mortality was recorded in either group. Treated rats presented: a) a decrease in granuloma size, which contained less fungal cells; b) a lack of specific antibodies up to 35 days pi., and c) {{a significant increase in the}} footpad swelling test (DTH) against paracoccidioidin. Splenic cell transfer from CY-treated P. brasiliensis-infected donors to recipients infected alone led to a significant increase in DTH response in the latter versus untreated infected controls. Likewise, in treated infected recipients transferred with untreated infected donor spleen cells, footpad swelling proved greater than in controls. Thus, it would seem that each successive <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> subset belonging to the respective cascade may be sensitive to repeated CY doses administered up to 12 days pi [...] Alternatively, such CY schedule may induce the appearance of a T cell population capable of amplifying DTH response...|$|E
40|$|Oral {{lichen planus}} (OLP) {{is a common}} {{inflammatory}} condition of the oral mucous membranes which affects between one and {{two percent of the}} general population. In accordance with the protracted clinical course of OLP and its association with known auto-immune diseases, the level of self-tolerance is questionable and possibly diminished in patients with this disorder. Normal <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> function is reputedly an essential element in the maintenance of self-tolerance, and deficient cell-mediated suppressor activity is implicated in the pathogenesis of auto-immune diseases. For assessment of in vitro cell-mediated suppressor activity in OLP, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from ten patients with OLP and from 11 control subjects were activated with the plant mitogen concanavalin A (Con A), followed by co-culture with autologous responder cells. The ability of irradiated Con A-activated cells to suppress the proliferation of Con A-stimulated responder cells was determined. Con A-induced suppressor activity of PBMC in the OLP patients was significantly less than that in control subjects (p = 0. 001). Results of the present investigation complement previous in vitro findings which provided indirect evidence of deficient cell-mediated suppressor activity in OLP, particularly a decreased proportion of circulating CD 4 +CD 45 RA+ lymphocytes and reduced Con A-stimulated PBMC proliferation. The depressed Con A-induced suppressor activity of PBMC in the OLP patients provides direct evidence of deficient in vitro cell-mediated suppressor function in OLP, and suggests that defective cell-mediated suppressor circuits and reduced self-tolerance may be involved in the pathogenesis of this disorder...|$|E

This antigenic pattern was detected by OKT monoclonal antibodies. PMA treatment did not cause {{the expression of a}} cytotoxic function but rather induced the expression of a suppressor cell marker. This marker was characterized by the ability of the treated CEM cells to suppress [3 H]thymidine incorporation into phytohemagglutinin-activated peripheral blood lymphocytes. After 4 days of treatment of CEM cells from either cloned or the parental cell population with 16 nM PMA, 71 - 98 % of the cells expressed reactivity with OKT 3 and OKT 8 antibodies whereas reactivity with OKT 4 and OKT 6 was detected in {{less than or equal to}} 1 - 8 % of the cells. The CEM cells can be divided into five groups based on the antigenic patterns of cells from randomly isolated clones. The cells from four of these groups were characterized by either low or high reactivity with each of the four OKT antibodies. The antigenic pattern of the fifth group resembled that of the parent CEM cells. The acquisition of reactivity with the OKT 3 antibody in the CEM cells after PMA treatment was dependent on both time and dose and did not require cell replication. Acquisition of reactivity with OKT 3 antibody also occurred after treatment with phorbol 12, 13 -dibutyrate but not after treatment with phorbol 13 -monoacetate, phorbol 12, 13 -diacetate, or dimethyl sulfoxide.

To investigate the local immunosuppressive microenvironment, {{we examined the}} presence of <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> and tolerising dendritic cells (DCs), the expression of immunosuppressive cytokines (IL- 10, TGFβ 1 and TGFβ 2) and the enzyme indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase (IDO) using qRT–PCR and immunohistochemistry in primary skin melanomas, negative and positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLN), and lymph nodes with advanced metastases. Our results indicate that tolerogenic DCs and <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> are present in melanoma at all stages of disease progression. They express transforming growth factor β receptor 1 (TGFβR 1), and are therefore susceptible to TGFβ 1 and TGFβ 2 specifically expressed by primary melanoma. We found that expression of IDO and interleukin 10 (IL- 10) increased with melanoma progression, with the highest concentration in positive SLN. We suggest that negative SLN contain immunosuppressive cells and cytokines, due to preconditioning by tolerogenic DCs migrating from the primary melanoma site to the SLN. In primary melanoma, TGFβ 2 is likely to render peripheral DCs tolerogenic, while in lymph nodes IDO and TGFβ 1 may have a major effect.

40|$|The murine major {{histocompatibility}} complex I-J subregion has recently {{been the subject of}} much controversy. The Ia- 4 locus within I-J encodes a <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> surface marker (1), as well as a suppressor T cell factor determinant (2). Using recombinant strain distribution patterns, independent investigators mapped I-J between I-B and I-B and I-E, in the chromosomal segment bounded by recombination points in strains BI 0. A(5 R) and B 10. S(9 R) on the left and B 10. A(3 R) and B 10. HTT on the right (1, 2). However, when Steinmetz and coworkers (3) mapped restriction site polymorphisms in I region DNA, B 10. A(3 R) and B 10. A(5 R) DNA were identical. The interval between I-A and I-E was confined to 3. 4 kb, including at least 2 kb of the Ea gene (3, 4). Despite considerable evidence supporting placement of l-J within the I region (1, 2, 5, 6), these results suggested I-J had been incorrectly mapped. We recently reconciled these conflicting results (7). I-J expression is controlled by two unlinked genes; one (Jt) maps to chromosome 4 near the b and Fv-I loci and a second is located within the I region, possibly I-E. Strains B 10. A(3 R) and B 10. A(5 R) each provide the requisite H- 2 Kgene for I-J k expression, but the former apparently lacks the appropriate I-J k locus on chromosome 4 (reference 7; summarized in Table I). This report describes experiments to probe the jt contribution to the I-J k molecule. Complementation tests suggest that strain B 10. HTT, like B 10. A(3 R), is probably not congenic with C 57 BL/ 10 and differs from B 10. S(9 R) outside rather than inside H- 2 (the murine major {{histocompatibility complex}}) ~. Binding of I-JLspecific monoclonal antibodies to cell surface I-J k determinants depends on o~-D-mannosyl residues associated with protein.

In a group of 16 patients with distant metastases, partial regressions were recorded in 2 (12. 5 %) patients and long (> 6 -month) stabilizations of a tumor process were observed in other 2 (12. 5 %) patients. The median time prior to progression was 3 (range 1. 5 - 12) months. Thirteen patients on adjuvant treatment did not achieve the median time to progression: 4 patients showed no signs of disease progression ? 12 to ? 25 months after metastasectomy. Patients with a clinical effect (disease regression or long stabilization) showed {{a significant increase in the}} populations of CD 3 +CD 8 + and CD 3 -CD 16 + T lymphocytes (natural killers (NK) cells) after 3 vaccinations from 23. 3 to 27. 2 % (p = 0. 018) and from 15. 17 to 20. 3 %, respectively (p = 0. 03). Prior to vaccine therapy, the count of CD 3 +CD 16 +-NK cells was thrice greater in patients with the progressive disease than that in the donor group - 11. 2 and 3. 5 %, respectively. The baseline count of CD 4 +CD 25 + Т lymphocytes in patients with progressive disease was also significantly higher than that in patients with the clinical effect - 12. 01 and 5. 6 %, respectively. Conclusion. In patients with RCC, DC-based vaccine therapy is able to induce a specific anti-tumor immune response that is transformed into the clinical effect in some cases. The baseline count of <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> (NKT and T-reg) populations may be a factor that predicts the efficiency of autologous DC-based vaccine therapy in patients with RCC. This immunotherapeutic approach merits further study, by defining the indications for its application in patients with RCC. </span...|$|E
40|$|Mouse {{and human}} {{interferon}} can modify the immune response in different and seemingly contradictory ways (1). Thus, interferon preparations inhibit lymphocyte proliferation {{in a primary}} mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) 1 (2 - 5) but, on the other hand, enhance lymphocytotoxicity (3 - 6). We wanted to determine the action of interferon on the generation of other functional lymphocyte subsets, such as allospecific primed lymphocytes (7, 8) or <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> (9 - 12). The results presented herein show that human interferon inhibits the generation of allospecific <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> that normally develop from lymphocytes primed in vitro against allogeneic ceils (9 - 12). This effect might influence considerably the generation of other functional lymphocyte subsets during an allogeneic response, such as cytotoxic effector cells and allospecific primed lymphocytes. Materials and Methods Donors. Normal individuals and families were HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C typed with highly selected local and VIIIth Workshop typing sera, with the standard National Institutes of Health two-stage complement-dependent lymphocytotoxicity technique at room temperature. B lymphocyte DRw determinants were typed on B-enriched cell suspensions with an adaptation of the same technique (13). Medium. Tissue culture medium was RPMI 1640 (Gibco Laboratories, Grand Island Biological Co., Grand Island, NY) buffered with NaHCO. ~, supplemented with penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 /. tg/ml), and fungizone (250 /xg/ml), and enriched with normal human serum.

There is evidence that the Ts cell inducing antigen on ADJ-PC- 5 plasmacytoma cells of BALB/c origin is a self antigen, which is also expressed on normal BALB/c spleen cells. In order to study this Ts cell inducing determinant in more detail we have developed an in vitro system which allows the selective activation of ADJ-PC- 5 specific Ts cells in the absence of activation of cytotoxic T (Tc) cells.

40|$|The cell-mediated immune {{reactivity}} (CMI) of mice {{to contact}} chemicals such as picryl chloride (PC 1) {{is influenced by}} thymus-derived <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> (1, 2). The development of these <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> is stimulated by the intravenous administration of 2, 4, 6 -trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS). Zembala and Asherson have further demonstrated that a specific suppressor factor(s) can be detected in the supernates of cultured <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> cells. This factor suppresses the transfer of contact sensitivity (CS) to PC 1 (1, 2). In experiments reported elsewhere (3), we {{have shown that the}} PC 1 suppressor supernates of Zembala and Asherson can also suppress the development of contact sensitivity to PC 1. The immunochemical analysis of suppressor factor (SF) operative in the CS response to PC 1 has revealed many similar properties (3) to other suppressive moieties functioning to limit the plaque-forming cell (PFC) response to dinitrophenylated-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (DNP-KLH) (4) or to synthetic copolymers (5). The comparable sizes of the molecular species as well as the strict antigen specificity of each respective suppressive factor, suggested {{that there might be a}} common origin of these substances. Indeed, in each case these respective factors were found to bear determinants controlled by the H- 2 gene complex (4, 5). Recently, in selected systems, the I-J subregion has been found to code for the Ia determinants present on suppressor cells (6) and suppressor factors (4, 5). In accord with these findings, we report that antigen-specific SF which limit the CS response to PC 1 bear I-J determinants, implying that analogous suppressive regulatory mechanisms in CMI as well as antibody responses may be determined by genes of one subregion of the H- 2 complex...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the pathogenesis of}} macroglobulinemia in the tropical splenomegaly syndrome (TSS), we assessed the functional activity of B <b>lymphocytes</b> and <b>T</b> cell subsets in a pokeweed mitogen-driven assay of immunoglobulin synthesis. Mononuclear cells from patients with TSS produced more IgM than cells from village or from distant controls. This appeared to result from {{a decrease in the}} number and/or activity of <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> cells of the T 8 + phenotype. The lack of functional <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> was associated with the presence in sera from patients with TSS of IgM antibodies that specifically killed T 8 +, 9. 3 -, 60. 1 + T cells from normal donors. These results support the hypothesis that macroglobulinemia in TSS results from defective immunoregulatory control of B cell function, and that this may be caused by lysis of <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> cells by specific lymphocytotoxic antibodies produced by patients with this syndrome...|$|R

40|$|A {{prevailing}} {{and persistent}} subject of controversy in immunology {{is whether the}} mechanism of immune tolerance to self antigens involves active, cell-mediated regulatory processes or is effected centrally and directly via interactions between antigen and effector cell precursors (e. g., 1 - 7). The debate continues to be fueled by evidence for both regulatory (7) and direct mechanisms (8, 9) in similar systems. Many investigators now believe that multiple pathways lead to selftolerance, forming a web of failsafe mechanisms against autoimmunity (4, 5). The mechanism of T cell tolerance has been especially difficult to approach because of our limited understanding of (a) antigen recognition by T ceils, (b) the complex T cell regulatory circuitry, and (c) the molecular and physiological basis for antigen-specific, T cell-mediated suppression (i. e., {{the nature of the}} off signal, half-life of clonal inactivation, reversibility, target cell death).

These cells were found at Day 4 after infection and exerted their effect by activating antigen-specific <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> which affected the efferent phase of the DTH response.

This phenomenon was further studied in cultures of lymphocyte populations isolated from healthy donors. It was found that <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> activated by PWM in cultures co-stimulated with Con A, with high T:B cell ratio, or with an increased proportion of OKT 8 + T cells can suppress the S. aureus-induced response.

40|$|A serial {{study of}} {{peripheral}} blood <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> in 27 patients with clinically definite multiple sclerosis and 11 healthy controls {{was carried out}} over a 12 month period.

Persistently low T cells numbers, including both the helper and <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> cell subsets, were, however, associated with disease activity {{as measured by the}} development of increased disability {{during the course of the}} study. This was true both for the patients with relapsing/remitting disease and those with progressive disease. The importance of carrying out a serial study was emphasised by the consistent and significant differences that were detected between individuals in both the control and the patient groups.

40|$|It is {{now well}} {{established}} that regulatory helper and <b>suppressor</b> <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> {{play a critical}} role in determining the magnitude and nature of a variety of immune responses. Different lines of experiments indicate that T ceils recognize not only surface-bound antigens, but also idiotypic (1, 2) and allotypic (3) determinants on helper T cells and/or B lymphocytes. In addition, it is clear that the antigenrecognition function of several classes of <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes,</b> including helper cells, cytolytic <b>T</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> (CTL) 1, and the effector cells of delayed hypersensitivity (4), is restricted by the major histocompatibility gene complex (MHC). The MHCrestricted collaboration between antigen-specific helper <b>T</b> and B <b>lymphocytes</b> (5, 6) implies that antigen-specific T cells recognize receptor-bound antigen in some form of an association with MHC gene products, although it is difficult to demonstrate directly such an associative recognition mechanism in normal immune-cell populations.
