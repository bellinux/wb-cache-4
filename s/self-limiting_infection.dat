In this study, hepatic gene expression analysis was performed to identify any molecular signature associated with the outcome of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in chimpanzees. Acutely HCV-infected chimpanzees with <b>self-limited</b> <b>infection</b> or progression to chronicity were studied. Interferon stimulated genes were induced irrespective of the outcome of infection. Early induction of a set of genes associated with cell proliferation and immune activation was associated with subsequent viral clearance. Specifically, two of the genes: interleukin binding factor 3 (ILF 3) and cytotoxic granule-associated RNA binding protein (TIA 1), associated with robust T-cell response, were highly induced early in chimpanzees with <b>self-limited</b> <b>infection.</b> Up-regulation of genes associated with CD 8 + T cell response was evident only during the clearance phase of the acute <b>self-limited</b> <b>infection.</b> The induction of these genes may represent an initial response of cellular injury and proliferation that successfully translates to a "danger signal" leading to induction of adaptive immunity to control viral infection.

50|$|Although Hepatitis E often causes {{an acute}} and <b>self-limiting</b> <b>infection</b> (the virus usually {{resolves}} {{itself and the}} individual recovers) with low mortality rates in the western world, it bears {{a high risk of}} developing chronic hepatitis in immunocompromised patients with substantial mortality rates.

Furthermore, in healthy individuals during the duration of the infection, the disease severely impairs a person’s ability to work, care for family members, and other daily activities. Hepatitis E occasionally develops into an acute, severe liver disease, and is fatal in about 2% of all cases. Clinically, it is comparable to hepatitis A, but in pregnant women the disease is more often severe and is associated with a clinical syndrome called fulminant liver failure.

METHODS: A total of 316 subjects with <b>self-limited</b> HBV <b>infection</b> and 316 patients with persistent HBV infection (195 subjects without familial history), matched with age and sex, from the Chinese Han population were enrolled in this study. Polymorphisms of MTP at the promoter region - 493 and at H 297 Q were determined by the allele specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: The ratio of males to females was 2. 13 : 1 for each group and the average age in the <b>self-limited</b> and chronic <b>infection</b> groups was 38. 36 and 38. 28 years, respectively. None of the allelic distributions deviated significantly from that predicted by the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. There was a linkage disequilibrium between H 297 Q and - 493 G/T (D’ = 0. 77). As the χ 2 test was used, the genotype distribution of MTP- 493 G/T demonstrated {{a significant difference between}} the <b>self-limited</b> <b>infection</b> group and the entire chronic group or the chronic patients with no family history (χ 2 = 8. 543, P = 0. 015 and χ 2 = 7. 199, P = 0. 019).

40|$|Background/Aims: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) {{infection}} {{results in}} a high frequency of chronic disease. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify early prognostic markers of disease resolution by performing a comprehensive analysis of viral and host factors during the natural course of acute HCV infection. Methods: The clinical course of acute hepatitis C was determined in 34 consecutive patients. Epidemiological and virological parameters, as well as cell mediated immunity (CMI) and distribution of human leukocyte antigens (HLA) alleles were analysed. Results: Ten out of 34 patients experienced <b>self-limiting</b> <b>infection,</b> with most resolving patients showing fast kinetics of viral clearance: at least one negative HCV RNA test during this phase predicted a favourable outcome. Among other clinical epidemiological parameters measured, the self-limiting course was significantly associated with higher median peak bilirubin levels at the onset of disease, and with the female sex, but only the latter parameter was independently associated after multivariate analysis. No significant differences between self-limiting or chronic course were observed for the distribution of DRB 1 and DQB 1 alleles. HCV specific T cell response was more frequently detected during acute HCV infection, than in patients with chronic HCV disease. A significantly broader T cell response was found in patients with <b>self-limiting</b> <b>infection</b> than in those with chronic evolving acute hepatitis C. Conclusion: The results suggest that host related factors, in particular sex and CMI, play a crucial role in the spontaneous clearance of this virus. Most importantly, a negative HCV RNA test and broad CMI within the first month after onset of the symptoms represent very efficacious predictors of viral clearance and could thus be used as criteria in selecting candidates for early antiviral treatment...|$|E

A serious concern with such treatments is that they may lead to the selection of drug-resistant strains. This has been a significant problem in the case of HIV infection. Existing mathematical-modelling studies of drug resistance have focused on the interactions between virus, target cells and infected cells, ignoring the impact of immune responses. Here, we present a model that explores the role of immune responses in the rise of drug-resistant mutants in vivo. We find that drug resistance is unlikely to be a problem if immune responses are maintained above a threshold level during therapy. Alternatively, if immune responses decline at a fast rate and fall below a threshold level during treatment (indicating impaired immunity), the rise of drug-resistant mutants is more likely. This indicates an important difference between HIV, which impairs immunity and for which immune responses have been observed to vanish during treatment, and viral infections such as influenza and rhinoviruses, for which such immune impairment is not present. Drug resistance is {{much more likely to be}} a problem in HIV than in acute and <b>self-limiting</b> <b>infections...</b>|$|R

40|$|Cancer is {{a leading}} cause of death in the world. Much work has been done to study the role of {{inflammation}} in carcinogenesis. One hypothesis suggests that inflammation causes oxidative stress that induces damage to cellular targets, including DNA. The multistep model of cancer proposes that cancer is a genetic disease in which mutations are required in carcinogenesis. When this theory was championed, research focused on somatic mutations. The focus has broadened to include epigenetic mechanisms in changing gene expression. The association between chronic infection, chronic inflammation and increased cancer risk has been supported by epidemiologic studies. Data link chronic inflammation associated with infectious disease to increased cancer risk. Some examples of such infectious agents include hepatitis B virus, Schistosoma haemotobium, and Helicobacter pylori. One objective of this thesis was to investigate the role of inflammation in <b>self-limiting</b> <b>infection.</b> Additional objectives focus on evaluating a novel model of intestinal and extraintestinal cancer, and using immune regulating cells as treatment for intestinal cancer. For the first objective, a murine mutational analysis model was used to study infection with Citrobacter rodentium, an enteric bacterium that causes self-limiting hyperplasia and inflammation. Increased mutant frequency was observed in association with elevated levels of iNOS 13 days post infection. The second aim, to characterize a novel model of neoplasia, led to the discovery of basosquamous cancer in mice with intestinal tumors. Finally, Apc-[Min] mice, a model of intestinal neoplasia, were treated with T regulatory cells to investigate the role of these cells on tumor development. These(cont.) cells were previously observed to have an anti-inflammatory and therapeutic effect on an infection-driven model of colon cancer. It was shown that T regulatory cells led to a {{decrease in the number of}} adenomas. In conclusion, it has been shown that <b>self-limiting</b> <b>infection</b> can increase mutant frequency.
