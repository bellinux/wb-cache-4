40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{establish}} a load history generation approach for full-scale accelerated fatigue tests. Primary focus {{is placed on the}} load cycle identification such as to minimize experimental time while having no significant effects on the new generated load history. The load cycles extracted from an original load history are identified into three kinds of <b>cycles</b> namely main, <b>secondary</b> and carrier <b>cycles.</b> Then the principles are presented to generate the load spectrum for accelerated tests, or a large percentage of small amplitude carrier cycles are deleted, a certain number of <b>secondary</b> <b>cycles</b> are merged, and the main cycle and the sequence between main and <b>secondary</b> <b>cycles</b> are maintained. The core of the generation approach is that explicit criteria for load cycle identification are established and equivalent damage calculation formulae are presented. These quantify the damage for accelerated fatigue tests. Three validation examples of its application for the generation approach of accelerated load histories are given in the paper. Good agreement of experimental lives between the original and generated load histories is obtained. Finally, the generation approach of accelerated load histories is applied to the full-scale accelerated fatigue test of helicopter tail, demonstrating the practical and effective use of the proposed approach. <br/...|$|R

5000|$|The Ghanaian {{education}} system is divided in three parts: [...] "Basic Education", <b>secondary</b> <b>cycle</b> and tertiary Education. [...] "Basic Education" [...] lasts 11 years(Age 4-15), {{is free and}} compulsory. It is divided into Kindergarten(2 years), primary school(2 modules of 3 years) and Junior High school(3 years). The junior high school(JHS) ends on the Basic Education Certificate Examination (BECE). Once the BECE achieved, the pupil can pursue into <b>secondary</b> <b>cycle.</b> <b>Secondary</b> <b>cycle</b> can be either general (assumed by Senior High School) or vocational(assumed by technical Senior High School, Technical and vocational Institutes and a massive private and informal offer). Senior High school lasts three years and ends on the West African Secondary School Certificate Examination (WASSCE). Other secondary institutions leads to various certifications and diplomas. Tertiary education is basically divided into university (academic education) and Polytechnics(vocational education). The WASSCE is needed to join a university bachelor's degree program.A bachelor's degree lasts 4 years and can {{be followed by a}} 1 or 2 year Master. The student is then free to start a Phd, usually completed in 3 years. Polytechnics are opened to vocational students, from SHS or from TVI. A Polytechnic curriculum lasts 2 to 3 years. Ghana also possesses numerous colleges of education. New tertiary education graduates have to serve one year within the National Service Scheme. The Ghanaian {{education system}} from Kindergarten up to an undergraduate degree level takes 20 years.|$|E
50|$|This {{pathogen}} causes <b>secondary</b> <b>cycles</b> {{of disease}} by mode of zoospores. Zoospores {{interact with the}} host by sensing and moving toward the nutrient gradients near the root tip and wounds of the plant. Without this means of sensing entry points {{there would be no}} <b>secondary</b> <b>cycles</b> of disease. Zoospores, chlamydospores, and sporangia produce a germ tube that directly penetrates the epidermis of the plant. With out this penetration device the pathogen {{would not be able to}} infect the plant. The pathogen interferes with transport by infecting the roots. Typically hyphae can be seen in the pith and cause blackening and necrosis. Infection can proceed rapidly once the pathogen has made an entrance into the plant. Once established, further reproduction of both chlamydospores and sporangia will occur within host tissues, amplifying the spread of disease within the host plant and spreading out into nearby plants. Upon death of the host, the decomposing infected tissues will release the pathogen back into the soil, in the form of chlamydospores and zoospores. A resting spore, the chlamydospores are capable of surviving in the soil for years, but it has been noted that cold winters cause an inhibitory effect on the survival rate. This results in less black shank infections where tobacco is grown in cooler, more northern climates.|$|R

50|$|Spores of M. cicadina {{are capable}} of germinating and infecting cicadas at as little as one year; but may remain dormant for either 13 or 17 years before {{becoming}} active. Cicadas first become infected by fungal spores as the nymphs prepare to leave the soil and become adults. Early stages of the infection are completely concealed inside the abdomen of the cicada. At or near {{the death of the}} host, the rear segments of the abdomen fall off, revealing a white, chalky mass of the fungus, which actively produces and forcibly discharges spores. These spores are infective to other periodical cicadas, and create a <b>secondary</b> <b>cycle</b> of disease. At the end of this <b>secondary</b> <b>cycle,</b> the fungus produces a different kind of spores, which have thick, ornamented walls and are not directly infective to adult cicadas; these spores lie dormant in soil.

ProSEDS performance will vary because ambient conditions change along the orbit and tether-circuit bulk elements at the cathodic end follow the step-by-step sequence for the current cycles of operating modes (open-circuit, shunt and resistor modes for primary cycles; shunt and battery modes for <b>secondary</b> <b>cycles).</b> In this work we discuss expected ProSEDS values of the ratio L,/L*, which jointly with cathodic bulk elements determines bias and current tether profiles; L, is tether length, and L* (changing with tether temperature and ionospheric plasma density and magnetic field) is a characteristic length gauging ohmic versus baretether collection impedances. We discuss how to test bare-tether electron collection during primary cycles, using probe measurements of plasma density, measurements of cathodic current in resistor and shunt modes, and an estimate of tether temperature based on ProSEDS orbital position at the particular cycle concerned. We discuss how a temperature misestimate might occasionally affect the test of bare-tether collection, and how introducing the battery mode in some primary cycles, for an additional current measurement, could obviate the need of a temperature estimate. We also show how to test bare-tether collection by estimating orbit-decay rate from measurements of cathodic current for the shunt and battery modes of <b>secondary</b> <b>cycles...</b>|$|R

50|$|Cercospora zeae-maydis survives {{only as long}} as {{infected}} corn debris is present; however, it is a {{poor soil}} competitor. The debris on the soil surface is a cause for primary inoculation that infects the incoming corn crop for the next season. By late spring, conidia (asexual spores) are produced by Cercospora zeae-maydis in the debris through wind dispersal or rain. The conidia are disseminated and eventually infect new corn crop. In order for the pathogen to actually infect the host, high relative humidity and moisture (dew) on the leaves are necessary for inoculation. Primary inoculation occurs on lower regions of younger leaves, where conidia germinate across leaf surfaces and penetrate through stomata via a flattened hyphal organ, an appressorium. Cercospora zeae-maydis is atypical in that its conidia can grow and survive for days before penetration, unlike most spores that need to penetrate within hours to ensure survival. Once infection occurs, the conidia are produced in these lower leaf regions. Assuming favorable weather conditions (see Environment Section), these conidia serve as secondary inoculum for upper leaf regions, as well as husks and sheaths (where it can also overwinter and produce conidia the following season). Additionally, wind and heavy rains tend to disperse the conidia during many <b>secondary</b> <b>cycles</b> {{to other parts of the}} field causing more <b>secondary</b> <b>cycles</b> of infection. If conditions are unfavorable for inoculation, the pathogen undergoes a state of dormancy during the winter season and reactivates when conditions favorable to inoculation return (moist, humid) the following season. The fungus overwinters as stromata (mixture of plant tissues and fungal mycelium) in leaf debris, which give rise to conidia causing primary inoculations the following spring and summer.|$|R

50|$|The {{life cycle}} of R. microsporus is quite similar to the general life cycles of common Rhizopus species.The primary feature as a plant {{pathogen}} is the intake of resources from a plant host. The initial infection occurs from asexual spores overwintered in plant debris. These spores infect the host where susceptibility is best, such as young roots of rice seedlings, or the mature sunflower head. Once infected, the production of hyphae and mycelium continue to spread the infection, creating sporangia as a <b>secondary</b> <b>cycle.</b> The resources gathered {{are a result of}} the symbiotic relationship with Burkholderia species, allowing for rhizoxin production to kill plant cells.|$|E

50|$|Septoria {{is present}} {{in many parts of}} the world, but has only become {{prevalent}} in the marijuana industry with the movement towards legalization. Ranging from the Emerald Triangle in California, to the cold winds of the east coast, Septoria is becoming an increasing nuisance for cannabis growers. Like most Septoria species they require moist and humid conditions to germinate, because of their conidia being immotile, and survive during the off-season by overwintering on dead and decaying organic matter. The disease moves to other parts of the plant during periods of rain or heavy wind, which enable the dispersal of ascospores (primary cycle) and conidia (<b>secondary</b> <b>cycle)</b> to roam and infect other vegetative tissue.|$|E
50|$|In spring, when {{conditions}} are favorable, ascospores are discharged from perithecia that have overwintered in fallen leaves and canes and disseminate to infect young leaves of raspberry plants. Once infected, the raspberry leaf {{serves as a}} nutrient source for the fungus to begin producing secondary inoculum, or conidia, within pycnidia, a survival structure that protects the spores. Conidia can undergo several repeating <b>secondary</b> <b>cycles</b> and re-infect other nearby plants. When {{the leaves of the}} raspberry plant begin to fall, perithecia form in the fallen tissue where asci and ascospores will be produced and protected until the following spring. The perithecia are black, found subepidermaly. The ascospores are characterized by a cylindrical, curved shape and are pointed at both ends with four septate usually.|$|R
50|$|This {{pathogen}} {{thrives in}} temperatures ranging from 84 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Disease is prominent in many agricultural productive regions and therefore {{is a major}} host to many warm environment crops. Black Shank needs water for germination and movement. Saturated soil optimizes disease spread because water is used for dissemination of motile zoospores and Sporangia. Low-lying areas of the soil that remain wet for prolonged periods of time will have more disease. Splashing water from rain or irrigation can infect healthy plant leaves leading to more repeating <b>secondary</b> <b>cycles.</b> Soils that are not saturated will lead to little to no disease development, so water management is important. Optimum soil pH for development is between 6 and 7. Levels of calcium and magnesium levels in the soils can affect disease progress.|$|R

5000|$|The disease cycle for Septoria {{cannabis}} {{is identical}} to that of Septoria tritici [...] or Septoria of tomato except {{for the production of}} a perithecium instead of a pseudothecium. Being that it is a polycyclic disease, it can asexually produce conidia in a pycnidium which continually inoculates new hosts throughout the growing season, as well as sexually produce ascospores in a perithecium which acts as an overwintering structure. The disease survives on plant debris from the previous growing season as ascospores in a perithecium, as well as mycelium on the epidermal tissue layers of leaves. The thick cell wall of the ascospores provides protection and allows for the disease to remain in the infected growing area until favorable conditions return. When the conditions are favorable (summer-fall) the spores are released and carried by wind or raindrops to a nearby host. Once infected the disease quickly spreads via the production of conidia in the <b>secondary</b> <b>cycle</b> which is accompanied by the sexual production of ascospores. Pycnidium are formed on the leaf lesions.|$|E
5000|$|Martin {{describes}} {{the education system}} in the PRK as based very closely on the Vietnamese model, pointing out that even the terms for primary and secondary education have been changed into direct translations of the Vietnamese terms. Under the PRK regime, according to Martin, the primary cycle had four instead of six classes, the first level of secondary education had three instead of four classes, and the second level of secondary education had three classes. Martin writes that not every young person could go to school because schooling in towns and in the countryside required enrollment fees. Civil servants paid (in 1987) 25 riels per month to send a child to school, and others paid up to 150 riels per month. According to Martin, [...] "Access to tertiary studies was reserved for children whose parents worked for the regime and had demonstrated proof of their loyalty to the regime." [...] She writes that, from the primary level on, the contents of all textbooks except for alphabet books were politically oriented and dealt [...] "more specifically with Vietnam." [...] From {{the beginning of the}} <b>secondary</b> <b>cycle,</b> Vietnamese language study was compulsory.|$|E
