25|$|Turkey {{continues}} to systematically disregard Greek national sovereign territory by violating air and <b>sea</b> <b>borders.</b> In March 2015 the Turkish forces {{had intended to}} carry out a military exercise in the Aegean disrupting international air traffic, and restricted traffic around two Greek national airports. Turkey subsequently withdrew the earlier Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) reserving an extensive area of air space over the Aegean from March 2 to December 31, 2015. The Greek government lodged complaints with NATO, the European Union, the United Nations, and the International Civil Aviation Authority over this flashpoint and NATO was thought to have played a role de-escalating.|$|E
25|$|In Quảng Ninh, {{there are}} {{numerous}} rivers and springs, but most are short and small, and feature currents that differ between seasons. In winter, most rivers run dry; in summer, waterfalls pick up fast currents. The water current reaches 1.45 m3/s in dry season, but up to 1,500 m3/s in the rainy season. Quảng Ninh's <b>sea</b> <b>borders</b> upon the Gulf of Bắc Bộ. It is large and protected by the ranks of islands, so the wind is quieter and the water smoother.

Concern has also been expressed about the potential influx of illegal migrants through Turkey to Bulgaria and Romania and then to present Schengen countries. Although the original plan was for Schengen Area to open its air and <b>sea</b> <b>borders</b> with Bulgaria and Romania by March 2012, and land borders by July 2012, continued opposition from Germany, Finland and the Netherlands has delayed the two countries' entry to the Schengen Area.|$|E

2500|$|A new {{military}} school was created called [...] "Yeonmu Gongwon", and an officers training program began.

It was an ironic mistake since nearly 300 years earlier, Joseon's navy was the strongest in all of East Asia. Now, the Korean navy was nothing but ancient ships that could barely defend themselves from the advanced ships of modern navies.|$|E
