40|$|In 2 experiments, I {{tested the}} effects of a {{treatment}} package for teaching 4 th graders to edit peers’ written algorithms for solving <b>math</b> <b>problems</b> such that an adult naïve reader could solve the problem. In Experiment 1, the editors were the target participants and the writers were the confederates. Participants were placed in a dyad that consisted of a writer and an editor. The writer and editor repeatedly interacted in writing until the writers produced an algorithm that resulted in adult naïve readers solving the problem. The editor was supplied with a checklist as a prompt for the editing process. Each dyad competed against a second pair of students, using a peer-yoked contingency game board as a motivating operation. Experiment 1 demonstrated that the treatment package increased participants’ accuracy of writing math algorithms, so that a naïve reader could solve the <b>math</b> <b>problems.</b> The target participants acquired the verbally governed responses through peer editing alone, and as a result the participants produced written math algorithms. Experiment 2 measured the behaviors of the editor and writer using a multiple probe design across participants with two groups of 4 writers and 4 editors. The dependent variables were: 1) production of previously mastered <b>math</b> <b>problems,</b> such that a naïve reader could read and solve the <b>math</b> <b>problem</b> without ever seeing the problem, 2) the emergence of explanations of “why” (function) from learning “how” to solve a multi-step <b>math</b> <b>problem,</b> 3) production of novel written math algorithms (i. e., find the perimeter and extended multiplication), and 4) cumulative number of untaught <b>math</b> <b>problems</b> attempted. The independent variable was the same as Experiment 1 except a) the editors did not have access to a checklist and b) the peer-yoked contingency game board was removed. The results demonstrated that all participants produced written math algorithms such that both the writers and editors affected the behavior of naïve readers. I discuss the emergence of explanations of the function (“why”) of math that occurred as a result of being able to explain “how” to solve problems. Moreover, the participants attempted more untaught <b>math</b> <b>problems,</b> demonstrating the resistance to extinction for attempting untaught <b>math</b> <b>problems.</b> Findings suggest that {{as a function of the}} intervention, reinforcement for solving <b>math</b> <b>problems</b> was enhanced...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of an eight-step cognitive strategy on verbal <b>math</b> <b>problem</b> solving performance of six learning disabled adolescents. The research was conducted in an applied setting by the investigator, the students' learning disabilities teacher. The cognitive strategy was designed to enable students to read, understand, carry out, and check verbal <b>math</b> <b>problems</b> that are encountered in the general math curriculum at the secondary level. A multiple baseline across individuals design permitted demonstration {{of the effectiveness of}} the strategy. Conditions of the experiment included baseline, treatment, generalization, maintenance, and, for two students, retraining. During treatment, students received strategy acquisition training over three sessions. When the students demonstrated verbalization of the eight strategy steps from memory, strategy application practice and testing commenced. Utilization of the strategy and improved performance were measured by scores on tests of two-step verbal <b>math</b> <b>problems.</b> The number of correct responses and the number of minutes taken to complete each test were recorded on graphs. Visual analysis of the data indicated that this eight-step cognitive strategy appeared to be an effective intervention for this sample of students who had deficits in verbal <b>math</b> <b>problem</b> solving. Overall, the students demonstrated improved performance on two-step verbal <b>math</b> <b>problems</b> with four of the six students generalizing the use of the strategy to three-step problems. Four students maintained improved performance over a two-week lapse in instruction and practice. Substantial increases were noted for the amount of time required to complete the verbal <b>math</b> <b>problem</b> solving tests immediately following strategy acquisition training. Completion time rapidly stabilized to an acceptable level. This study has implications for an alternative teaching methodology that focuses on cognitive strategy training to improve verbal <b>math</b> <b>problem</b> solving for learning disabled youngsters. Future research could offer evidence of the applicability of cognitive strategy training to other populations and further delineate the characteristics of students who do and do not benefit from cognitive strategy intervention...|$|R

I used independent performance measures representing the variables of mathematics content knowledge, general ability, and reading fluency. Non-performance variables included gender, socioeconomic status, language proficiency and special education qualification. Using a sequential regression and commonality analysis, I determined the amount of variance explained by each performance measure on the Oregon state math assessment in third grade. All variables were independently predictive of <b>math</b> <b>problem</b> solving scores, and used together, they explained 58 % score variance. The math content knowledge measure explained the most variance uniquely (12 %), and the measures of math content and general ability explained the most variance commonly (16 %). In the second analysis, I investigated whether additional variance was explained once student demographic characteristics were controlled and how this affected the unique variance explained by each independent performance measure. By controlling for demographics, the model explained slightly more than 1 % additional variance in math scores. The unique variance explained by each independent measure decreased slightly. This study highlighted the influence of various construct relevant and irrelevant variables on <b>math</b> <b>problem</b> solving scores, including {{the extent to which}} a language-free measure of general ability might help to inform likely outcomes.
