40|$|Objective: <b>Scheuermann</b> <b>disease</b> is a {{progressive}} thoracic or thoracolumbar kyphotic deformity of spine, {{which is the}} most common cause of structural kyphosis in adolescents. Braces have been applied in the treatment of such deformed immature skeletons of patients, through there are lack of definite results to verify that braces can be employed to treat deformities of <b>Scheuermann</b> <b>disease</b> effectively so far. The etiology is still incompletely unknown, although the episode of <b>Scheuermann</b> <b>disease</b> is related to genetics. The cause of <b>Scheuermann</b> <b>disease</b> is probably multifarious. So, it is necessary to comprehend the etiology and treatment of <b>Scheuermann</b> <b>disease</b> further. Data sources: A computer-based search of Medline for the articles about etiology and treatment of <b>Scheuermann</b> <b>disease</b> published between 1980 and 2003 was performed by using the key word "Scheuermann disease, and the language was limited to English". Study selection: After the articles were primarily checked up, some case reports were screened out, and retrospective clinical articles were looked up for the full texts. Data extraction: Totally 41 retrospective clinical studies on <b>Scheuermann</b> <b>disease</b> were collected, in which 33 were accordant with inclusion criteria, and 8 were excluded because they were simple case reports or reviews. Data synthesis: In the 33 articles, over 1100 clinical studies and experiments were performed on the etiology, pathology, natural history, diagnosis and treatment of <b>Scheuermann</b> <b>disease.</b> Operation manners included conservative treatment and surgical treatment. The braces for <b>Scheuermann</b> <b>disease</b> is most satisfactory to those with 45 ° to 65 ° thoracic kyphosis, but to those with conservative management- more than 75 ° kyphosis or those with conservative management-uncontrollable pain, they should be treated by operation after they were told to weigh the potential risk of operation and expected outcomes of nonoperative treatment. Kyphotic deformity-induced changes of physiological function mainly resulted from some physiologic activities of viscera in thoracic cavity and abdominal cavity compressed and limited by flexion deformity of spine. Physiological status of curvature of cervical vertebra, hip joint and knee joint could be improved or recovered by orthopaedic surgeries. Conclusion: Osteochondritis and epiphysitis result in <b>Scheuermann</b> <b>disease</b> nonspecifically. Lateral curvature possesses high incidence in the family members of <b>Scheuermann</b> <b>disease,</b> and is hereditary during successive passage. Kyphosis of <b>Scheuermann</b> <b>disease</b> was commonly found in weightlifting and manual workers, so mechanical factor may be one of the causes of <b>Scheuermann</b> <b>disease.</b> <b>Scheuermann</b> <b>disease</b> is controllable in majority patients treated with braces, and surgical treatment is only for those with unrelieved pain by conservative treatment or those with severe kyphosis(over 75 °) and progressive severity. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. OBJECTIVES: To {{find out}} if spinal {{epidural}} lipomatosis (SEL) occurs more commonly among patients with <b>Scheuermann</b> <b>disease</b> than in the general population. SUMMARY AND BACKGROUND: On {{the basis of our}} own radiologic and operative observation, SEL seems to occur frequently in patients with <b>Scheuermann</b> <b>disease.</b> METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging of 87 individuals (72 % male, average age 19 ± 6 y) from 2 centers (29 consecutive patients with <b>Scheuermann</b> <b>disease</b> and 58 controls) were retrospectively evaluated by 2 neuroradiologists. Spinal epidural fat (EF) at seventh thoracic vertebra (EF 7), maximum EF (EFmax), dural sac diameter at T 7 and at the level of maximum EF (DS 7 and DSmax) were measured. EF ratios at T 7 (EFR 7) and at maximum EF (EFRmax) were calculated as EF/DS. Body mass index (BMI) for study population and kyphosis severity for the patients were recorded. Mann-Whitney, Spearman correlation, and χ tests were performed dependent on the variable in question. RESULTS: EF 7, DS 7, EFmax, EFR 7, and EFRmax was significantly higher among patients with <b>Scheuermann</b> <b>disease</b> (EFmax 5. 7 ± 2. 4 mm) than among controls (EFmax 3. 8 ± 1. 1 mm), P 6 mm+EFRmax> 0. 51) compared with 2 (3 %) among controls (P< 0. 001). Patients with <b>Scheuermann</b> <b>disease</b> exhibited higher BMI than controls (24. 9 ± 5 kg/m vs. 22. 9 ± 4 kg/m, P= 0. 138). Logistic regression showed that the occurrence of SEL among patients with <b>Scheuermann</b> <b>disease</b> was independent of BMI (P= 0. 880). The degree of kyphosis in patients with Scheuermann's disease (62 ± 20 °) was correlated to the amount of the EF. CONCLUSIONS: As SEL occurs more frequently among patients with <b>Scheuermann</b> <b>disease,</b> spine magnetic resonance imaging should be routinely performed to screen each of these patients to avoid impending neurological injury during surgery, especially in those exhibiting SEL...|$|E

40|$|Bracing is {{the main}} non-surgical {{intervention}} {{in the treatment of}} idiopathic scoliosis during growth, in hyperkyphosis (and <b>Scheuermann</b> <b>disease)</b> and occasionally for spondylolisthesis; it can be used in adult scoliosis, in the elderly when pathological curves lead to a forward leaning posture or in adults after traumatic injuries. Bracing can be defined as the application of external corrective forces to the trunk; rigid supports or elastic bands can be used and braces can be custom-made or prefabricated. The state of research in the field of conservative treatment is insufficient and while it can be stated that there is some evidence to support bracing, we must also acknowledge that today {{we do not have a}} common and generally accepted knowledge base, and that instead, individual expertise still prevails, giving rise to different schools of thought on brace construction and principles of correction. The only way to improve the knowledge and understanding of brace type and brace function is to establish a single and comprehensive source of information about bracing. This is what the Scoliosis Journal is going to do through the "Brace Technology" Thematic Series, where technical papers coming from the different schools will be published...|$|E
40|$|Objective. To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} radiological signs of <b>Scheuermann</b> <b>disease</b> (SD) and low back pain (LBP) in a local population using lumbar magnetic resonance (MR) images. Summary of Background Data. SD is a spinal disorder, and both its classic and atypical (lumbar) forms are associated with LBP. However, radiological signs of SD are present in 18 % to 40 % of the general population, in whom the clinical signifi cance of “SD-like” spine remains largely unknown. Methods. This retrospective cohort study included 188 staff members from a single hospital. Participants ’ lumbar MR images and self-administered questionnaires concerning demographic information, LBP status, consequences, and functional limitations were collected. Participants were classifi ed into 2 groups according to whether lumbar MR images met SD diagnostic criteria, and LBP status, consequences, and functional limitation were compared. Follow-up interviews were conducted after 6 years to compare LBP progression. Results. Thirty-four participants (18. 1 %) had SD-like spine. Rates of lifetime, previous 1 -year, and point LBP did not signifi cantly differ between groups. However, among participants who had ever had LBP, SD-like spine was associated with higher rates of work absence (42. 1 % vs. 9. 5 %, χ 2 = 9. 620, P = 0. 002) and seeking medical car...|$|E

40|$|An {{increase}} of the physiological kyphosis during growth is defined hyperkyphosis (HK) and, according to the level where {{the apex of the}} curve can be retrieved, we can distinguish a thoracic HK and a thoraco-lumbar one, also called junctional kyphosis. Since these conditions can cause pain and esthetics impairments, lead in adulthood to an higher incidence of spinal and shoulder pain, and evolve during growth, it is important to manage this deformity. The aim of this paper was to present {{the state of the art}} about HK and its treatment. <b>Scheuermann</b> <b>Disease</b> (SCHK) is the better known cause of HK; other causes can be idiopathic or postural, trunk extensor muscles weakness or neurological problems. Despite etiology a specific treatment can be required during growth to prevent evolution and reach a better spinal alignment in adulthood. It is at the base of treatment and allow monitoring. There are some validated methods that can be used in a comprehensive rehabilitation approach. Evidence in this field is scanty, even if there is quite a consensus on possible treatments. They aim at improving posture and esthetics, and abolishing pain; they include: exercises, used mainly in mobile postural/idiopathic HK, and in SCHK without HK; braces (plus exercises, in this case aimed at reducing brace impairments), that in rigid HK and in most of SCHK patients also allow a better vertebral growth; surgery could be used in worst cases, even if it should be carefully considered, because it requires fusion and loss of spinal function...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction The {{literature}} contains several publications {{describing the}} use of visual arts to develop observational skills in medical students. Portraits of individuals of the Italian Renaissance {{can be used to}} enhance these skills and stimulate the development of differential diagnoses in medical students. The Duke of Urbino, Federico di Montefeltro (1422 – 1482), lost his right eye and nasal bridge during a jousting accident in 1450. Consequently, almost every profile of him in existence today depicts his face in a left lateral view. Although some authors have described the Duke's missing nasal bridge, none have described his prominent thoracic hyperkyphosis, which is clearly discernible in two paintings by Piero della Francesca. The purpose of this report is to describe the Duke's hyperkyphosis, develop relevant differential diagnoses, and suggest a possible etiology of the convexity. Case presentation We have examined two paintings of the Duke by Piero della Francesca – the diptych, The Duke and Duchess of Urbino (1465), and the Madonna of the Egg (1472). A MEDLINE search revealed 2 articles that were relevant to this study. This search was complemented by a search of the collection at the library of Seton Hall University, and the first author's experience studying at the University of Urbino. The historical data obtained from these searches were incorporated with the visual analysis to formulate a plausible etiology of the Duke's thoracic hyperkyphosis. Conclusion Differential diagnoses of the Duke's thoracic hyperkyphosis include <b>Scheuermann</b> <b>disease,</b> osteoporosis, and trauma-related spinal changes. Based on the available evidence, the Duke's thoracic hyperkyphosis could have been caused by repetitive trauma to the spine due to numerous hours on horseback with heavy armor. The role that osteoporosis played {{in the development of the}} hyperkyphosis is unclear, as is whether the Duke had the convexity during childhood. The hyperkyphosis as a stylistic variant by Piero della Francesca is unlikely. This report is an example of a teaching strategy that can be used to enhance the observational skills of medical students in evidence-based medical education. </p...|$|E
