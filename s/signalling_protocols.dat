25|$|OBD-II is an {{improvement}} over OBD-I in both capability and standardization. The OBD-II standard specifies the type of diagnostic connector and its pinout, the electrical <b>signalling</b> <b>protocols</b> available, and the messaging format. It also provides a candidate list of vehicle parameters to monitor along with how to encode the data for each. There is a pin in the connector that provides power for the scan tool from the vehicle battery, which eliminates the need to connect a scan tool to a power source separately. However, some technicians might still connect the scan tool to an auxiliary power source to protect data in the unusual event that a vehicle experiences a {{loss of electrical power}} due to a malfunction. Finally, the OBD-II standard provides list of standardized DTCs. As a result of this standardization, a single device can query the on-board computer(s) for these parameters in any vehicle. OBD-II standardization was prompted to simplify diagnosis of increasingly complicated emissions equipment, and though only emission-related codes and data are required to be transmitted through it according to U.S. legislation, most manufacturers have made the OBD-II Data Link Connector the main connector in the vehicle through which all systems are diagnosed and reprogrammed. OBD-II Diagnostic Trouble Codes are 4-digit, preceded by a letter: P for engine and transmission (powertrain), B for body, C for chassis, and U for network. Manufacturers may also add custom data parameters to their specific OBD-II implementation, including real-time data requests as well as trouble codes.|$|E

50|$|DPNSS was {{developed}} in the early 1980s by BT, or its forerunner, Post Office Telecommunications in recognition that the emerging Digital Private Circuit Primary Rate product 'Megastream' had to address the market for both data and voice, the latter being significantly greater because of the market for PBXs. At the time, BT dictated what signalling could be used on its leased lines and, whilst it only had a minority interest in the sales of PBXs, was requested by the PBX manufacturers to produce a standard to prevent the creation of a plethora of conflicting PBX protocols being developed. Under the liberalization rules of the day (1979), BT was barred from manufacturing, selling or supplying PBXs of more than 200 extensions. Digital (PCM-based) PBXs were just starting to come into the marketplace with the Plessey PDX (a licensed version of the ROLM CBX) and the GEC SL1 (a licensed version of the Northern Telecom SL1). It was recognised that corporate customers would wish to network these systems across the country. At the time, 'CAS' inter node signaling was slow and inter-register signaling MF5, developed from PSTN <b>signalling</b> <b>protocols,</b> was complex and would not support sufficient features.The support for DPNSS as BT's own signaling protocol also differentiated BT's private circuit’s services from those of its emerging rival Mercury Communications.DPNSS was an active (and successful) collaboration between PBX manufacturers and BT which started relatively slowly (BT & Plessey) but quickly snowballed with MITEL, GEC, Ericsson, Philips and eventually Nortel all joining to create a powerful and feature rich protocol.BT and some of the UK manufacturers championed DPNSS into ECMA and CCITT (ITU) but it was eventually deprecated by the standards bodies in favour of Q931 and QSig. Nevertheless, the elegance of the protocol and its compatibility with PBX features ensured the adoption DPNSS actually grew in Europe, compared to the much slower take-up of Qsig.There were also attempts (during 1984) to take DPNSS into North America. Unfortunately the structures for the creation of standards in North America seemed to prevent manufacturer collaboration as a route forward and the ANSI standards body was not interested in creating PBX interworking standards.Version 1 of BTNR188 (DPNSS) was issued in 1983; the last version of DPNSS to be released 6 in 1995 included compatibility with ISDN features released in V5. A lightweight version of DPNSS 'APNSS' {{was developed}} using analogue trunks (Sometimes compressed) and a modem to support D channel signalling.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in both satellite and terrestrial mobile communications technologies are now {{leading to the}} realisation of {{the dream of the}} global personal communications within a few years. Satellite systems, as a complement to terrestrial cellular systems, are introduced into the future Personal Communication Networks (S-PCN) to provide global coverage and to allow global roaming. The inter-working and the integration between the satellite and the terrestrial cellular systems (e. g. GSM system) are the key issues in developing the network architecture and designing the control functions and <b>signalling</b> <b>protocols</b> of satellite systems. This thesis focuses on the design of a satellite signalling control system. The coverage and link properties of ICO 10 and LE 066 satellite constellations, the representatives of low earth orbit (LEO) and medium earth orbit (MEO) satellite systems, are considered. A satellite specific network architecture is proposed to accommodate the requirements of satellite dynamics and resource control function. The physical layer of satellite signalling links are designed to cope with the specific features of LEO or MEO satellite air-interfaces. In order to overcome problems specific to LEO or MEO satellite systems and to provide call set-up control function, three important <b>signalling</b> <b>protocols</b> are proposed for the S-PCNs. The priority based fast access scheme is designed for the satellite random access channel allowing low access delay for the call set-up related access packets, even when the channel load is high. The satellite diversity based paging approach is proposed to optimize the paging performance. The modified selective re-transmission (M-SRT) and Go-Back-N (M-GBN) protocols are proposed to cope with the transaction type transmission on the dedicated control channel. Simulation results have shown siginficant improvement of the M-SRT and M-GBN protocols in call setup delay. Two protocols are also compared in the aspects of implementation complexity and call set-up performance. Finally, the integration scenarios between satellite and GSM system have been examined for S-PCN in the call handling related functions and associated <b>signalling</b> <b>protocols.</b> The GSM higher layer <b>signalling</b> <b>protocols</b> are tailored to provide the call control related functions. The optimum integration scenario is derived under the criterion of minimum modifications to the GSM higher layer <b>signalling</b> <b>protocols</b> and minimum complexities of the control functions...|$|E

The implementation feasibility of these protocols should be evaluated during their design phase, so that possible performance bottlenecks are identified and removed. In this paper we present a methodology for evaluating the performance of BISDN signalling systems under design. New performance parameters are introduced and their network-dependent values are extracted through a message flow model which has the capability to describe the impact of call and bearer control separation on the signalling performance. <b>Signalling</b> <b>protocols</b> are modelled through a modular decomposition of the seven OSI layers including the service user to three submodels. The workload model is user descriptive {{in the sense that}} it does not approximate the direct input traffic required for evaluating the performance of a layer protocol; instead, through a multi-level approach, it describes the actual implications of user signalling activity for the general signalling traffic. The signalling protocol model is derived from the global functional model of the <b>signalling</b> <b>protocols</b> and information flows using a network of queues incorporating synchronization and dependency functions. The same queueing approach is followed for the signalling transfer network which is used to define processing speed and signalling bandwidth requirements and to identify possible performance bottle-necks stemming from the realization of the related protocols.
