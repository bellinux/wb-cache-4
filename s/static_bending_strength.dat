Research completed at the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, College of EngineeringLaser machining being a non-contact process possesses several advantages such as no tool wear or damage and no contact force induced problems. Laser cutting involves thermal process {{and it does not}} depend on the strength and hardness of the work piece, thus making it ideal for cutting non-homogeneous material. In this research work several papers related to the heat affected zone (HAZ) of laser machining of CFRP and GFRP are reviewed. It was found that laser parameters such as specific laser energy, laser power, repetition rate, work piece temperature determine the extent of HAZ. In CFRP HAZ in perpendicular laser grooving is much higher than that in parallel grooving. Presence of nitrogen jet decreases the work piece temperature leading to lower HAZ. Observations of the HAZ area of CFRP material revealed fiber swelling of 50 or 60 % and fibers near the top are seen to curl up.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} some chemical, physical and mechanical properties of juvenile wood from black pine (Pinus nigra Arnold) plantations. Black pine, one of the important softwood species covers the most of the plantations in Turkey. Black pines that naturally grow in Duzce were 20 - 23 years old with the dimensions of 13 - 17 cm utilized in this study. Specimens were prepared and tested according to Turkish standards. The physical properties were measured and air and oven dry wood densities were found to be 0. 464 and 0. 431 g cm– 3, respectively. The volume weight was 0. 383 g cm– 3. The radial, tangential and volumetric shrinkage values were 4. 05, 6. 19 and 10. 24 %, respectively. The radial, tangential and volumetric swelling values were also found to be 3. 69, 7. 79 and 11. 5 %, respectively. The mechanical tests resulted in that the <b>static</b> <b>bending</b> and compression <b>strengths</b> were 79. 1 and 42. 4 N mm– 2, respectively. In addition juvenile wood had higher lignin and lower holocellulose content compared to the mature wood. Conclusively, the physical and mechanical properties of juvenile pine wood examined in this study were observed to be lower compared to the mature pine wood...|$|R
3000|$|The {{load-deflection curve}} for <b>static</b> <b>bending</b> and the force-time curve for impact bending of {{heat-treated}} wood {{were examined in}} detail. The effect of oxygen in air was also investigated. Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis Carr.) was heated for 0.5 – 16.0 h at a temperature of 160 °C in nitrogen gas or air. The dynamic Young's modulus {{was measured by the}} free-free flexural vibration test, the static Young's modulus and work needed for rupture by the <b>static</b> <b>bending</b> test, and the absorbed energy in impact bending by the impact bending test. The results obtained were as follows: (1) The static Young's modulus increased at the initial stage of the heat treatment and decreased later. It decreased more in air than in nitrogen. (2) The <b>bending</b> <b>strength</b> increased at the initial stage of the heat treatment and decreased later. It decreased more in air than in nitrogen. (3) The work needed for rupture decreased steadily as the heating time increased. It decreased more in nitrogen than in air. It is thought that heat-treated wood was more brittle than untreated wood in the <b>static</b> <b>bending</b> test because W 12 was reduced by the heat treatment. This means that the main factors contributing to the reduction of the work needed for rupture were viscosity and plasticity, not elasticity. (4) The absorbed energy in impact bending increased at the initial stage of the heat treatment and decreased later. It decreased more in air than in nitrogen. It was concluded that heat-treated wood became more brittle in the impact bending test becauseI [...]...|$|R
