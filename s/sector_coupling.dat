50|$|One {{of the key}} {{ingredients}} of modern realizations of CHM is the hypothesis of partial compositeness originally proposed by D. B. Kaplan. This hypothesis is automatically realized in Randall-Sundrum scenarios. Every SM particle has a heavy partner that can mix with it. In practice the SM particles are linear combinations of elementary and composite states:where α denotes the mixing angle. Partial compositeness is naturally realized in the gauge sector where an analogous phenomenon happens quantum chromodynamics and is known as photon-ρ mixing. For fermions it is an assumptions that in particular requires the existence of heavy fermion with equal quantum numbers as SM quarks and leptons. These interact with the Higgs through the mixing. One schematically finds the formula for the SM fermion masses,where L and R refer {{to the left and}} right mixings, Y is a composite <b>sector</b> <b>coupling.</b>|$|E

Commonly discussed counter measures are a European super grid or new electric storage options. Instead, we examine in this paper how energy <b>sector</b> <b>coupling,</b> i. e., the interconnection of the power, heat, hydrogen, and natural gas sector, can help {{to make use of}} this surplus energy potential in an economic manner. To this end, we employ a detailed cost-optimizing energy system model for a German 2020 and 2050 scenario. We explore different coupling tech-nologies and their economic interrelations, as well as their interaction with electrical storage options. The model is regionally resolved and allows to locate different technologies in accordance with regional VRE supply and transmission capabilities. The results reveal systematic benefits of energy <b>sector</b> <b>coupling</b> compared to a purely electric storage solution. The heat sector absorbs large parts of the temporary electricity oversupply from VREs and makes long term electricity storage via hydrogen or natural gas questionable.

40|$|The galaxy {{clusters}} exhibit noticeably anisotropic {{pattern in}} their clustering, which is vividly manifested {{by the presence}} of rich filament-like superclusters. The more anisotropic the clustering of galaxy clusters is, the more straight the rich filament-like superclusters become. Given that the degree of the anisotropy in the largest-scale clustering depends sensitively on the nature of dark energy, the supercluster straightness may play a complimentary role in testing dynamic dark energy models. Here we focus on the coupled dark energy (cDE) models which assume the existence of dark <b>sector</b> <b>coupling</b> between scalar field dark energy and nonbaryonic dark matter. Determining the spines of the superclusters identified in the publicly available group catalogs from the CODECS (COupled Dark Energy Cosmological Simulations) for four different cDE models {{as well as for the}} LCDM model, we quantify the straightness of each supercluster as the spatial extent of its spine per member cluster where a supercluster spine represents the main stem of the minimal spanning tree constructed out of the member clusters. It is shown that the dark <b>sector</b> <b>coupling</b> plays a role in making the supercluster less straight relative to the LCDM case and that in a cDE model with supergravity potential the superclusters are least straight. We also find that the difference in the degree of the supercluster straightness between the cDE and the LCDM cases increases with redshifts. A physical interpretation of our result as well as its cosmological implication are discussed.

40|$|There are two {{competing}} concepts for {{the integration of}} high shares of renewable energy: the coupling of electricity to other energy sectors, such as transport and heating, and the reinforcement of transmission networks. In this paper both <b>sector</b> <b>coupling</b> and continent-wide grid integration are considered in the model PyPSA-Eur-Sec- 30, the first open, spatially-resolved, temporally-resolved and sector-coupled energy model of Europe. Using a simplified network with one node per country, the cost-optimal system is calculated for a 95 % reduction in carbon dioxide emissions compared to 1990, incorporating electricity, transport and heat demand. The demand-side management potential from battery electric vehicles (BEV), power-to-gas units (P 2 G) and long-term thermal energy storage (LTES) make {{a significant contribution to}} the smoothing of variability from wind and solar and to the reduction of total system costs.
