5|$|The {{problem of}} {{induction}} discussed above {{is seen in}} another form in debates over the foundations of statistics. The standard approach to statistical hypothesis testing avoids claims about whether evidence supports a hypothesis or makes it more probable. Instead, the typical test yields a p-value, which is the probability of the evidence being <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> {{under the assumption that}} the hypothesis being tested is true. If the p-value is too low, the hypothesis is rejected, in a way analogous to falsification. In contrast, Bayesian inference seeks to assign probabilities to hypotheses. Related topics in philosophy of statistics include probability interpretations, overfitting, and the difference between correlation and causation.|$|E

This distinction appears in Phenomenology of Perception (p.207, 2nd note [...] ) and is sometimes repeated in terms of spoken and speaking language (...) (The Prose of the World, p.10).

Speaking language (...) , or primary expression, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> is language in the production of a sense, language at the advent of a thought, at the moment where it makes itself an advent of sense.|$|E

The first was Stumme, who observed that all speakers can understand each other, [...] "because the individual dialects of their language are not very different." [...] This was later confirmed by Ahmed Boukous, a Moroccan linguist and himself a native speaker of Shilha, who stated: [...] "Shilha is endowed with a profound unity which permits the Shluh to communicate without problem, from the Ihahan in the northwest to the Aït Baamran in the southwest, from the Achtouken in the west to the Iznagen in the east, and from Aqqa in the desert to Tassaout in the plain of Marrakesh." ...|$|E

2500|$|There were various {{opinions}} regarding Abdul Rahman being declared {{unfit for}} trial. Critics said that declaring him insane would not solve what they {{regarded as a}} constitutional flaw that allows prosecution under Islamic law. An editorial in the Washington Times wrote that declaring him mentally unfit is [...] "a manufactured loophole" [...] which would enable the Afghan government [...] "to back down to avoid a disastrous internal and diplomatic crisis.

This is interspersed with remarks on the ravages of time. [...] As cancer develops painfully within him, Van and Ada restructure 80 years of fragments into a conversation about death, and Van breaks off from correcting his essentially complete but not yet fully polished work as the book becomes distorted. The book stops referring to Van and Ada, merging them into [...] "Vaniada, Dava or Vada, Vanda and Anda", as they begin a suicide and [...] "die into the finished book".

2500|$|In 1775, Johann Friedrich Blumenbach {{described}} {{the white race}} as [...] "the white color holds the first place, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that most Europeans. The redness of cheeks in this variety is almost peculiar to it: at all events it is but seldom seen in the rest... Color white, Cheeks rosy". He categorized humans into five races, which largely corresponded with Linnaeus' classifications, except for the addition of Oceanians (whom he called Malay). He characterized the racial classification scheme of Metzger as making [...] "two principal varieties as extremes:(1) the white man native of Europe, of the northern parts of Asia, America and Africa..", and the racial classification scheme of John Hunter as having, [...] "seven varieties:... (6) brownish as the southern Europeans, Turks, Abyssinians, Samoiedes and Lapps; (7) white, as the remaining Europeans, the Mingrelians and Kabardinski". Blumenbach is known for arguing that physical characteristics like skin color, cranial profile, etc., were correlated with group character and aptitude. Craniometry and phrenology would attempt to make physical appearance correspond with racial categories. The fairness and relatively high brows of Caucasians were held to be apt physical expressions of a loftier mentality and a more generous spirit. The epicanthic folds around the eyes of Mongolians and their slightly sallow outer epidermal layer bespoke their supposedly crafty, literal-minded nature.|$|E
