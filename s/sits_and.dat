It features Barlow performing the song in France, walking down a highway littered with stage props and crew members actively changing the scenes as he walks forward.

The video ends with Barlow running away from a woman down a country road, as the video fades from view.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} if {{a single}} massage of the hamstring muscle group would alter {{the performance of}} the <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> reach test. Methods: Before treatment, each of 11 male subjects performed the <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> reach test. The treatment consisted of either massage of the hamstring muscle group (both legs, total time about 15 minutes) or supine rest with no massage. Performance of the <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> reach test was repeated after treatment. Each subject returned the subsequent week to perform the tests again, receiving the alternative treatment relative to their initial visit. Mean percentage changes in <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> reach scores after treatment were calculated for the massage and no massage treatments, and analysed using Student’s t tests. Results: Mean (SD) percentage changes in <b>sit</b> <b>and</b> reac...|$|R

5|$|The video {{begins with}} the sound of a ticking clock and Levine and Rihanna sitting {{opposite}} each other at a table, tapping their hands and staring at one and other. As the songs audio begins to play, band members of Maroon 5 start to play their instruments as Rihanna <b>sits</b> <b>and</b> watches them. The table and band scenes are intercut with each other for the first verse and chorus. For the second verse, Levine and Rihanna appear to argue and try to ignore the other's advances. Rihanna lays suggestively on a bed while Levine sits on a chair with his head turned in the opposite direction for the bridge. For the final chorus, the pair appear to reconcile, ending with Levine finally giving in to his temptations and walk {{to the end of the}} table where Rihanna <b>sits</b> <b>and</b> he caresses her neck causing Rihanna to lean towards him seductively and the two nearly kiss as the video ends. The video was made available to download digitally via iTunes on May 12, 2008.|$|E
5|$|In {{the prose}} section {{at the end}} of Lokasenna, the gods catch Loki and bind him with the innards of his son Nari, while they turn his son Narfi into a wolf.

5|$|Near {{the top of}} the inrun, {{there is}} a 'start gate' – a metal or wooden beam – on which an athlete <b>sits</b> <b>and</b> awaits their signal to jump via a set of traffic lights (green, amber, and red). These lights are {{operated}} directly by Borek Sedlák. An athlete may enter the gate when amber is shown. If red is shown after this point, the wind conditions will have been deemed unfavourable for a safe jump: the athlete must then carefully exit the gate as they had entered it and await another opportunity to jump. Failure to dismount the gate within ten to fifteen seconds of being shown a red light, or jumping without having been given the signal to go, will disqualify the athlete.|$|E

Willow, injured, <b>sits</b> <b>and</b> concentrates on moving the machine with telekinesis; she fails, but Tara sees what she is doing.

25|$|To {{defend a}} territory, the male {{exhibits}} perching behaviour {{starting in the}} mid- to late afternoon until dusk. Some individuals are able to reclaim the same territory several afternoons in a row. The longest period of time recorded in which one male defended the same territory was three days. The males choose sunny spots on hilltops, through which females are likely to travel. If no hilltops are available, the males wait in channels in the vegetation that would funnel wandering females towards them. The perching male <b>sits</b> <b>and</b> waits, scanning the sky for any moving object. Periodically, he executes a patrol flight {{to get a better}} picture of the surrounding area. When the male spots a moving flying object, he flies directly towards it. If it is a male, the resident male chases him off his territory. If it is a female, the male chases the female, more slowly and less aggressively than with an intruding male, away from the perch site. The pair lands and copulates, which can last more than an hour.|$|E
