2500|$|When Rick and Scott Steiner {{started to}} team in 1989 a female fan (Robin Green) started {{following}} them around, professing {{her love for}} the cute and dorky Rick. Steiner's brother Scott and their manager Missy Hyatt began to have suspicions after the woman suddenly changed to a new vampy look. When the woman tripped Scott in the ring, causing him and Rick to lose to champions The Fabulous Freebirds, it briefly caused dissension among the brothers. In the end, <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Steiners, adopting the name Woman and vowed that the brothers would meet their [...] "doom" [...] at Halloween Havoc 1989 but never made it clear who or what “Doom” was.|$|E
2500|$|On the November 26, 2005 {{episode of}} Impact!, Gayda made her debut lashing out at Jeff Jarrett. Jarrett {{was shocked and}} frightened by Gayda's {{unexpected}} appearance and soon ordered her backstage. He was heard saying, [...] "It's not what you think." [...] After being pushed by Jarrett, Gayda slapped him and then went after his valet, Gail Kim. The following week, Gayda came out again to confront Jarrett. After pushing and slapping, the two had to be pulled apart by officials. At Turning Point, {{the same thing happened}} in the main event match, but Gayda was restrained by officials. On the December 31 show, Don West tracked down Gayda for an interview. She said her being there {{had nothing to do with}} a love affair, but rather that Jarrett had promised her a spot on the TNA Roster, but while she was stuck at home, <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> television to see Kim in her place. She said she had a big secret about Jarrett that TNA Management would love to hear, but did not reveal what it was.|$|E
2500|$|Performed by the Four Freshmen, [...] "Their Hearts Were Full of Spring" [...] (1961) was a {{particular}} favorite of the Beach Boys. Brian explained: [...] "My mom turned me on to them. <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> radio and goes, 'Hear that song? This is called 'Day By Day' by the Four Freshmen.' And I listened and I went 'Oh, I love it, Mommy! I love it!' ... We went in [...] and she said you can take records into these little booths and play them {{to see if you}} wanted to buy them. ... You know how you sit in a sauna bath and the sweat will come out? That's what that whole experience in that room started to be. I purged all kinds of bullshit and picked up the Freshmen. It was magic. Total magic." [...] By deconstructing their arrangements of pop standards, Brian educated himself on jazz harmony. Lambert notes, [...] "If Bob Flanigan helped teach Brian how to sing, then Gershwin, Kern, Porter, and the other members of this pantheon helped him learn how to craft a song." [...] Wilson continued: [...] "I learned them bar by bar. I'd go to my hi-fi set and I'd play a little bit. Then I'd stop and try to figure it out, back and forth, back and forth, until I figured the whole song out." ...|$|E
5000|$|While Tony Soprano is with Gloria, <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> song [...] "Affection" [...] by Little Steven and the Lost Boys. The same song {{is played}} over the end credits. Lead singer Steve Van Zandt plays Silvio Dante <b>on</b> <b>the</b> show.|$|R
5000|$|Carrie gets {{a frantic}} call from Saul {{who is being}} arrested. <b>She</b> <b>turns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> news to see reports that dozens of {{incumbent}} officials from the State Department, the Department of Defense, and the CIA have been arrested due to being connected to the assassination attempt.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Ryves stopped short, {{and this}} time <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> him <b>the</b> clouded {{clearness}} of her eyes. [...] "What {{do you mean to}} do with them?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{piano stool}} slowly {{and looked at}} him, smiling faintly.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> green drawing-room's couch (it was Empire, not Heppelwhite after all), {{and laid}} aside {{a list of}} linen and blankets.|$|E
60|$|He {{paid the}} cab, {{and turned to}} follow her. She passed inside and upstairs without a word. In her little sitting-room <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{electric}} light and looked around half fearfully.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> to <b>the</b> {{following}} week's {{report of}} the inquest. After a miserable perusal she could find no more pertaining to Mrs. Manston's address than this:-- ...|$|R
50|$|The video {{opens with}} Björk, in an orange tee, in a kitchen, {{seemingly}} thoughtful. She leans {{on a table}} and while she's admiring an egg, she starts to sing. <b>She</b> <b>turns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fire and start to fry some butter. As the second verse begins, the butter starts to burn so she takes it under the stream of the sink. She pours some oil in a pan and appears thoughtful again, afterwards she adds the eggs in the pan.|$|R
50|$|Leila visits {{her parents}} and learns that her mother is leaving her father and selling her {{childhood}} home. Her father is devastated, staying stoned on pot and refusing to do anything while her mother clears out the house. Leila's best friend, Victoria, {{is getting ready to}} be married, but confesses that she's had sex with an old boyfriend recently, despite her insistence that she loves her fiance and is ready to settle down. Leila is skeptical but supportive, and Victoria laughs when <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> VCR and discovers the porn tape Leila was watching; Leila tells her nothing about David.|$|R
60|$|The {{room was}} but a few steps away, in the same corridor, and when they arrived there Josie drew a bunch of slender keys from her purse and {{unlocked}} the door with no difficulty. Having entered, <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> electric lights and cast a curious glance around.|$|E
60|$|He {{took the}} keys from {{her fingers and}} opened the door, closing it again behind them. She led {{the way into the}} sitting-room. The whole place was in {{darkness}} but <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> electric light. The cloak slipped from her shoulders. He took her hands and looked at her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Goss, you had best give in--" [...] began Sergeant Brown, when Tom, {{sneaking up}} behind her, {{snatched}} the stew pan from her grasp. As <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> boy, Carter ran in, {{and in a}} twinkle she was held and her hands were bound behind her. Then the crowd turned to Mumps.|$|E
60|$|Here <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> it out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table-some bills, {{but mostly}} silver dimes and quarters.|$|R
60|$|Miss Fosbrook looked kindly at her, and <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> wistful eyes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> young governess.|$|R
6000|$|CRICHTON (slowly). You do please me, child, very much--(he half rises)--very much indeed. (If {{he meant}} to say more he checks himself. He looks at his plate.) No more, thank you. (The simple island meal is ended, save for the walnuts and the wine, and CRICHTON is too busy a man to linger long over them. But he is a stickler for etiquette, end the table is cleared charmingly, though with dispatch, before they are placed before him. LADY MARY is an artist with the crumb-brush, and there are few arts more {{delightful}} to watch. Dusk has come sharply, and <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> electric light. It awakens CRICHTON from a reverie {{in which he has}} been regarding her.) ...|$|R
60|$|Scarcely {{had they}} met when the Telegraph Avenue car {{came along and}} stopped {{to take on a}} crowd of {{afternoon}} shoppers. Mrs. Higginbotham divined from the grip on her arm as he helped her on, {{that he was not going}} to follow her. <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> step and looked down upon him. His haggard face smote her to the heart again.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{light and}} made some notes on her tablets, using the same queer {{characters}} that she always employed. The last note read: [...] "Tom Linnet, night clerk at the Mansion House. New clothes; new jewelry. Has money. Recently acquired, for no one with money would be a night clerk. Wants to quit his job and buy a cigar store. Query: Who staked Tom? And why?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Granny or mamma,--we {{know not}} which,--with the quick intuition {{of a great}} general, took in the whole {{position}} like a flash of light. <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ledge she had gained and dropped her tail. Baby seized it and clambered up. Then away she went like a rocket, and before the little one had well regained its former position she had topped the ridge full two yards ahead of the whole troop! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So I {{went right}} in, an' sure enough it did smell, for <b>she</b> had <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> all <b>the</b> gases, besides {{the one that}} was lighted.|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed, mama, but you can--and will," [...] {{pronounced}} the haughty voice of Blanche, as <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> round <b>on</b> <b>the</b> piano-stool; where till {{now she had}} sat silent, apparently examining sundry sheets of music. [...] "I have a curiosity to hear my fortune told: therefore, Sam, order the beldame forward." ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} strange occurrences befall the family. During the night, the {{contents}} of the kitchen are rearranged in bizarre configurations. The house alarm is set off when it detects that all entry points were breached simultaneously. Sammy suffers a fit while playing soccer and Lacy is shocked when hundreds of birds suddenly crash into the house. One night, Lacy is awakened by a sound from Sammy's room. When she goes to check <b>on</b> him, through <b>the</b> darkness she sees a figure standing over his bed. <b>She</b> <b>turns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> light to find an empty room. Sammy is found walking away from the house but cannot remember leaving. Lacy, Daniel and Jesse each suffer catatonic episodes and regain consciousness with no memory of their experiences. Strange symbols are found on Jesse and Sammy's bodies.|$|R
6000|$|There {{are some}} temptations--principally {{those of the}} smaller kind--which {{it is not in}} the {{defensive}} capacity of female human nature to resist. The temptation to direct the whole force of her influence, as the one young lady of the party, toward the instant overthrow of Allan's arrangement for meeting his friend, was too much for the major's daughter. <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> smiling Pedgift with a look which ought to have overwhelmed him. But who ever overwhelmed a solicitor? ...|$|E
6000|$|And Gertie was interested. Obviously. She {{was all of}} {{eighteen}} to-night. She frowned slightly as <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> piano-stool at Carl's entrance, and mechanically: [...] "This is a pleasant surprise." [...] Then, enthusiastically: [...] "Isn't it too bad that Dr. Doyle was out of town, or I would have invited him to my party, {{and he would have}} given us some of his lovely songs.... Do try the second verse, doctor. The harmony is so lovely." ...|$|E
6000|$|And {{there he}} waited with Patience {{by his side}} while the parish seemed to be {{endlessly}} striving over them. If one woman seemed {{about to make a}} proposal, half-a-dozen more fell on her and vowed that the poor orphans would be starved and overworked; till <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> foremost with [...] "And hadn't your poor prentice lad to go before the justices to shew the weals on his back?" [...] "Aye, Joan Stubbs, and what are you speaking up for but to get the poor children's sheep? Hey, you now, Stead Kenton--Lack-a-day, where be they?" ...|$|E
50|$|After the two {{had dinner}} the evening prior to his death, Goedele wanted to make love. Her husband {{abruptly}} refused and drunkenly revealed that he once raped Eva, impregnating her. He mixed up his pills with hers, causing an abortion and thus ruining her whole life {{in the field of}} pregnancy (she became infertile) and employment (it caused her to have psychiatric problems). Upon hearing this, Goedele angrily takes a blanket and wraps it around his neck. She then takes the quad-bike and drives his body into the forest. After putting the motorcycle against a tree, and wrapping a scarf she just knitted around his neck and into the spokes of <b>the</b> wheel, <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ignition and opens full throttle: In episode seven we learned Goedele was fascinated by a film about Isadora Duncan.|$|R
50|$|Dawn {{tries to}} leave but May grabs her and tears ligaments in her foot, giving Dawn medical advice {{as a form}} of taunting, {{continuing}} on from an earlier taunt claiming that Dawn cannot look after Summer properly, after discovering she applied fake suntan lotion to her for a baby beauty contest. This leads her to further taunt Dawn, by implying that she will possibly get a tattoo for Summer's 18th birthday. May grabs Summer, calling her Sophie, and begins packing Summer's things, but Dawn distracts her and Mickey throws her out of the bedroom, locking the door after her. May tries to smash the door down, but finding this impossible, goes downstairs and opens the music box she had brought for Summer. <b>She</b> <b>turns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> gas, lights a cigarette causing an explosion and instantly dies.|$|R
50|$|After <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> pro <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 2nd of March, 2012, Muguruza {{was given}} a {{wildcard}} at the 2012 Miami Open for her first WTA main draw appearance. There, she upset former world No. 2 Vera Zvonareva and former world No. 10 Flavia Pennetta before falling in the round of 16 to the eventual champion, Agnieszka Radwańska in straight sets.|$|R
60|$|Somebody {{moved as}} she went in, for there was a rustle and a board cracked, but her hand touched the pistol and <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{powerful}} electric torch. As the beam of light swept across the room {{she saw that the}} drawer of a small writing-table had been pulled out. Then the beam passed on and touched a man kneeling beside her open trunk. The clothes she had not unpacked were scattered on the floor, as if the man had been looking for something, and a lantern stood near his hand. She thought he had just put it out, since she noted a smell of oil.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lights, {{and began}} {{directly}} in her low, pleasant voice: [...] "This table is my grandfather's writing-table. Most {{of the later}} poems were written at it. And this is his pen--the last pen he ever used." [...] She took it {{in her hand and}} paused for the right number of seconds. [...] "Here," [...] she continued, [...] "is the original manuscript of the 'Ode to Winter.' The early manuscripts are far less corrected than the later ones, as you will see directly.... Oh, do take it yourself," [...] she added, as Mrs. Bankes asked, in an awestruck tone of voice, for that privilege, and began a preliminary unbuttoning of her white kid gloves.|$|E
6000|$|... "So 't is, if y' do a bit 'f excavating." [...] <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bearded one. [...] "'nd I guess {{all this}} {{shrubbery}} is fake, 'f {{you come down}} to it!" [...] She wrenched at the unhappy man's beard. It came off in her hands, leaving a square chin behind it. [...] "If this ain't a wig, y'll have a headache t'morrow," [...] observed Miss Trimble, weaving her fingers into his luxuriant head-covering and pulling. [...] "Wish y' luck! Ah! 'twas a wig. Gimme those spect'cles." [...] She surveyed the results of her handiwork grimly. [...] "Say, Clarence," [...] she remarked, [...] "y're a wise guy. Y' look handsomer with 'em on. Does any one know this duck?" ...|$|E
50|$|Standing in line {{waiting for}} bread some time later, Natia is grabbed by Kote and {{pulled into a}} car with his friends. Though Eka tries to help her she is {{ultimately}} unsuccessful. <b>She</b> then <b>turns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> adults in the line who have done nothing to stop Natia's kidnapping and swears at them until {{one of the men}} strikes her down.|$|R
5000|$|The next morning, Big Ella wakes {{everyone}} up {{explaining that}} she provided evidence on a newscasting that the reporters made false accusations about Alex. Alex {{does not believe}} her and so <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> television to the media explaining: [...] "Alex was framed by nasty reporters who just wanted a story." [...] Big Ella, who is obsessed with Santa Clause, is shown on television explaining to reporters that [...] "Alex loves Santa Clause. All Alex {{wanted to do was}} tell you that he was giving all his money to save the polar bears. The polar bears are Santa's neighbors. Santa loves them and he loves Alex too, and so do I." [...] Everyone applauses the actions that Big Ella took to save Alex's reputation and the group's state dinner. That following night, the band raises money from that state dinner and donated it to a charity that helps global warming.|$|R
30|$|It is a {{cold winter}} evening, the {{temperature}} in the house is low, the heating system is activated to reach soon a temperature that will ensure comfort and well-being to Bob and Mary that are going to come back home after a busy working day. The blinds close to avoid the dispersion of heat. As soon as they get into the house, <b>the</b> lights <b>turn</b> <b>on.</b> Mary goes into the kitchen and set about making dinner; <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> oven that will soon bake tasty pork shank. In the laundry, the washer and dryer are temporarily suspended to avoid overload. Bob comes into the living room, where <b>the</b> lights <b>turn</b> <b>on.</b> He is very tired and decides to sprawl <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sofa and enjoy some videos. Therefore, he prepares the projector for watching the video taken by of his GoPRO while skying <b>the</b> previous Sunday <b>on</b> mountain holiday. <b>The</b> video projection begins, and the lights turn down to create soft lights.|$|R
