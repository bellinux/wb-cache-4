5|$|By {{the time}} the {{division}} was in place, the battle lines on both sides had largely solidified, leaving the 45th Infantry Division in a <b>stationary</b> <b>position</b> as it conducted attacks and counterattacks for the same ground. The division was put {{under the command of}} Eighth Army's I Corps for most of the conflict. It was deployed around Chorwon and assigned to protect the key routes from that area into Seoul. The terrain was difficult and the weather was poor in the region. The division suffered its first casualty on 11 December 1951.|$|E
5|$|A {{cover system}} {{can be used in}} combat as {{assistance}} against enemies. Players have the ability to lean around, over, and under cover, which {{can be used as a}} tactical advantage during shootouts and stealth levels. The game gives players a wide variety of weapon options; they can be found on the ground, retrieved from dead enemies, or removed from their <b>stationary</b> <b>position</b> and carried around. Weapon ammunition must be manually retrieved from the ground or from dead enemies. Players have access to a weapon inventory, which allows them to carry as many weapons as they find. With some of these weapons, players have the ability to dual wield, giving them an advantage over enemies by dealing twice as much damage. Players can also customize weapons through the use of upgrades; for example, a rocket launcher can be attached to the side of an assault rifle, and a laser cannon can be transformed into a wire cutting tool.|$|E

The turret is standard-equipped with passive IR and night vision sensors. It also has fire control and stabilization. As a result of the armament on the Fahd 280-30, the IFV can provide fire support to infantry and it is capable of engaging tanks, armored vehicles, low flying aircraft, helicopters and personnel, with the ability to engage in a <b>stationary</b> <b>position,</b> on the move, in day or nighttime conditions, with high accuracy.

40|$|We {{consider}} an abstract nonlinear second order evolution equation, inspired by some models for damped oscillations of a beam subject to external loads or magnetic fields, and shaken by a transversal force. When {{there is no}} external force, the system has three <b>stationary</b> <b>positions,</b> two stable and one unstable, and all solutions are asymptotic for $t$ large {{to one of these}} stationary solutions.

5000|$|A {{car on a}} {{slippery}} surface can slide a long way if the driver [...] "locks" [...] the wheels in <b>stationary</b> <b>positions</b> by pressing hard on the brakes. Anti-lock braking systems use wheel speed sensors and vehicle speed sensors to determine {{if any of the}} wheels have stopped turning. The ABS Module then briefly releases pressure to that wheel to allow the wheel to begin turning again. Anti-lock brakes can be much more effective than cadence braking which is essentially a non-automatic technique for doing the same thing.|$|R
2500|$|A {{variation}} of front crawl {{often used in}} training involves only one arm moving at any one time, while the other arm rests and is stretched out at the front. This style is called a [...] "catch up" [...] stroke because the moving hand touches, or [...] "catches up" [...] to the stationary one before the stationary hand begins its motion. Catch up requires more strength for swimming because the hand is beginning the pull from a <b>stationary</b> <b>position</b> rather than a dynamic one. This style is slower than the regular front crawl and is rarely used competitively; however, it is often used for training purposes by swimmers, as it increases the body's awareness of being streamlined in the water. Total Immersion is a similar technique.|$|E

2500|$|Like {{much of the}} Confederate Army after First Manassas, the 19th {{spent the}} rest of the year and part of the next in a <b>stationary</b> <b>position</b> around Cub Run. There the men learned how to drill and live like soldiers. They took their turn on the picket line and were {{occasionally}} involved in skirmishes. Camplife became the order of business, as they set up winter camp near Fairfax Court House, Virginia, in October, 1861. [...] Companies and battalion drill were frequent, as were inspections and parades. [...] The soldiers enjoyed the uneventful days of winter camp. [...] Along with card playing and sport playing, they enjoyed the sermons of Reverend John H. Griffin of Company H. [...] Griffin soon became the regimental chaplain. [...] Along with picket duty and drill, the 19th also built entrenchments on the high points around Fairfax. [...] Private Z.L. Gilmer of Company described the 19th positions as [...] "impenentrable to the enemy," [...] and noted in his diary that the slaves who also took part were paid the same as the soldiers (11.00 dollars). In January, 1862, the 19th performed picket duty every 16 days, with each wing alternating on the eighth day. [...] While on picket duty, Philip St. George Cocke was given leave on December 16, and went home to his father's home at Bremo Bluff, in Fluvanna County. [...] He never returned to his command, as on December 26, 1861, he committed suicide by a single shot from a pistol in his mouth. John Strange was sick in the hospital, so Colonel Armistead Rust took command of the regiment, but soon, he was given leave home, so Captain James Mallory of Company took command of the regiment until Strange's return.|$|E

2500|$|Cricket bowlers, {{since they}} are not {{restricted}} to a small strike zone as their target, also use {{a wide variety of}} approaches which are not available to baseball pitchers. These involve varying the line and length of deliveries and using unpredictable movement caused by the ball bouncing on the pitch before it reaches the batsman. Baseball pitchers, by contrast, must use changes in ball speed and movement (cricket bowlers also vary ball speed) caused only by air friction and spin to deceive batters, as most pitches which come near touching the ground are ineffectively allowed to pass as balls. The raised undulating stitching on a baseball allows an accomplished pitcher to create a huge variety of motions in the air; even fastballs are thrown {{in such a way as}} to create certain kinds of movement. The cricket ball also moves in the air, to a lesser degree than the baseball, but it achieves its most pronounced movement on the bounce, with seamers landing to ball on the seam to create slight but unpredictable turn, and spinners using spin to create significant turn and bounce variation. Furthermore, pitchers must begin their throw from a <b>stationary</b> <b>position,</b> while bowlers may run up to their delivery. (In the early days of baseball, the pitcher pitched from anywhere within a [...] "box" [...] and so had more flexibility as to where to stand when releasing the ball, before the 1880s.) Baseball pitchers also throw from an elevated mound ( [...] above the level of home plate), while cricket bowlers are at the same height as the batsman (because every 6 deliveries which end of the pitch is used for bowling and batting switches) and must bowl with an overarm (or roundarm, a style rarely seen today) rotation of the arm during which the arm must not straighten by more than 15 degrees. (This was also a restriction on pitchers in the early days of baseball, abolished in the 1880s; today, baseball pitchers use a variety of delivery motions discussed below.) Despite the differences in delivery action, the delivery speeds are similar for both sports with the fastest bowlers and pitchers propelling the ball in the region of : the fastest recorded cricket delivery is [...] with baseball's record quicker at [...] It is the case, however, that baseball pitches near or at 100mph are considerably more common than bowled balls of comparable velocity in cricket. The bowler in cricket is much more restricted with respect to how much he can straighten his arm in delivering the ball, and this is one very significant reason why baseball pitchers can deliver the ball faster with more frequency.|$|E
