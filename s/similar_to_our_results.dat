In this study, the ratio of damo archaea to damo bacteria was 1.77 : 1, which needs to be further promoted. Recently, several new techniques were used to enrich and purify damo archaea. Ding et al.

The calculation {{is based on the}} t-J model within a mean-field theory with Gutzwiller approximation. Various types of surface geometries are considered. <b>Similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>result</b> in the extended Hubbard model, it is found that the formation of zero-energy states strongly depends on the surface geometry. In addition to this feature, the zero-energy states give peak splitting for the (110) surfaces when the super-exchange interaction $J$ is large. This is due to the induced s-wave component near the surface.

40|$|We prove a new CLT for the {{difference}} of linear eigenvalue statistics of a Wigner random matrix H and its minor Ĥ and find that the fluctuation is {{much smaller than the}} fluctuations of the individual linear statistics, {{as a consequence of the}} strong correlation between the eigenvalues of H and Ĥ. In particular our theorem identifies the fluctuation of Kerov's rectangular Young diagrams, defined by the interlacing eigenvalues of H and Ĥ, around their asymptotic shape, the Vershik-Kerov-Logan-Shepp curve. This result demonstrates yet another aspect of the close connection between random matrix theory and Young diagrams equipped with the Plancherel measure known from representation theory. For the latter a CLT has been obtained in [18] which is structurally <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>result</b> but the variance is different, indicating that the analogy between the two models has its limitations. Moreover, our theorem shows that Borodin's result [7] on the convergence of the spectral distribution of Wigner matrices to a Gaussian free field also holds in derivative sense.

In literature, we found only one study, by Souer et al., in which results of plate fixation in closed ipsilateral multiple metacarpal fractures were evaluated [9]. The study was retrospective, unlike our study. They found total active motion (TAM) > 230 ° in 18 of 19 patients. They had two patients with plate-related complications and one delayed union. Their functional results as evaluated by TAM were quite <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>results.</b> Gupta et al., in their prospective study, divided patients with fractured metacarpals into four groups. They found TAM > 230 in all patients in the group where fracture was fixed with plates [27]. Dabezies and Schutte reported no complications in 27 unstable metacarpal fractures fixed with plates [40]. Our low complication rate is similar to their results. Other authors have reported that patients with open fractures and severe soft tissue injury have high rate of complications [45, 48 – 50]. Nonunion and delayed union are infrequent findings in metacarpal fractures. Souer et al. reported 1 of 19 patients having delayed union [9]; the patient was a smoker.

The difference has been attributed to infiltrating tumours having lower cellular density and causing little structural abnormality. Also, intra-hepatic cholangiocarcinomas tend to be much larger at presentation.
