5|$|Although {{at least}} some of the poems {{attributed}} to Narihira in imperial anthologies are dubious, there is a large enough body of his work contained in the relatively reliable Kokinshū for <b>scholars</b> <b>to</b> discuss Narihira's poetic style. Narihira made use of engo (related words) and kakekotoba (pivot words).|$|E

5|$|Many dialects {{have also}} {{undergone}} {{a degree of}} simplification of their morphology that has caused some <b>scholars</b> <b>to</b> consider them to have ceased to be polysynthetic.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} comprehensive {{teachings of}} anekāntavāda doctrine {{is found in}} the Tattvarthasutra of Umasvati, considered to be authoritative by all Jain sects including Svetambara and Digambara. The century in which Umaswati lived is unclear, but variously placed by contemporary <b>scholars</b> <b>to</b> sometime between 2nd and 5th century.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, Sleipnir is {{mentioned}} in a riddle {{found in the}} 13th century legendary saga Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks, in the 13th century legendary saga Völsunga saga as the ancestor of the horse Grani, and book I of Gesta Danorum, written in the 12th century by Saxo Grammaticus, contains an episode considered by many <b>scholars</b> <b>to</b> involve Sleipnir. Sleipnir is generally accepted as depicted on two 8th century Gotlandic image stones: the Tjängvide image stone and the Ardre VIII image stone.|$|E
5|$|Approximately sixteen {{lists of}} censured theses were {{issued by the}} University of Paris during the 13th and 14th centuries. Most of these lists of propositions were put {{together}} into systematic collections of prohibited articles. Of these, the Condemnations of 1277 are considered particularly important by those historians who consider {{that they had a}} side effect of encouraging <b>scholars</b> <b>to</b> question the tenets of Aristotelian science. From this perspective, some revisionist historians maintain that the condemnations had positive effects on the development of science, perhaps even representing the beginnings of modern science.|$|E

5|$|Hans Bethe {{once said}} that Klaus Fuchs was the only {{physicist}} he knew who truly changed history. Because {{the head of the}} Soviet project, Lavrenti Beria, used foreign intelligence as a third-party check, rather than giving it directly to the scientists, as he did not trust the information by default, it is unknown whether Fuchs's fission information had a substantial effect. Considering that the pace of the Soviet program was set primarily by the amount of uranium they could procure, it is hard for <b>scholars</b> <b>to</b> accurately judge how much time this saved.|$|E
5|$|In 1333–34, {{an attempt}} by some {{dissatisfied}} Oxford <b>scholars</b> <b>to</b> found a new university at Stamford, Lincolnshire, was blocked by the universities of Oxford and Cambridge petitioning King Edward III. Thereafter, until the 1820s, no new universities were allowed to be founded in England, even in London; thus, Oxford and Cambridge had a duopoly, which was unusual in western European countries.|$|E

5|$|In 1958, Howe {{was made}} {{chancellor}} of Dalhousie University. On investigating the university's finances, {{he found that}} a professor's salary in 1958 had less buying power than when he had worked there. Howe urged increased salaries and building improvements to attract first-rate <b>scholars</b> <b>to</b> the university. He also accepted a number of honorary degrees from other universities.|$|E
5|$|In his 2005 and 2006 {{biographies of}} Druitt, D. J. Leighton {{concluded}} that Druitt was innocent, but repeated some of Knight's and Wilding's discredited claims. Leighton suggested that Druitt {{could have been}} murdered, either out of greed by his elder brother William or, as previously suggested by Howells and Skinner, {{out of fear of}} exposure by Harry Wilson's homosexual cronies. The propensity of theorists to associate Ripper suspects with homosexuality has led <b>scholars</b> <b>to</b> assume that such notions are based on homophobia rather than evidence.|$|E
5|$|In {{respect to}} the Greek {{language}} question, it becomes obvious that {{from the very beginning}} Hermes o Logios adhered to Korais’ views. Korais claimed that the appropriate language for the Greek nation should be a vernacular (Demotic) language without foreign words and accepted some views by conservative <b>scholars</b> <b>to</b> retain a tincure of archaism. On the other hand, some of Korais' opponents, both conservatives and vernacularists, published their own magazines in which they attacked his linguistic views.|$|E

5|$|It is {{difficult}} for <b>scholars</b> <b>to</b> piece together the exact form of the entertainments, but clues have been gleaned from the written accounts, scripts, artworks, and tapestries that derived from these famous occasions. Though such sources must be treated with caution, since they contain demonstrable inaccuracies and contradictions, they provide evidence of the richness and scale of Catherine de' Medici's court festivals.|$|E
5|$|Karnataka's pre-history {{goes back}} to a paleolithic hand-axe culture {{evidenced}} by discoveries of, among other things, hand axes and cleavers in the region.
