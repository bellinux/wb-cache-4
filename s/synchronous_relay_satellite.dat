40|$|The {{results are}} {{reported}} of the ATS- 6 /GEOS- 3 and the ATS- 6 Nimbus- 6 satellite-to-satellite orbit determination experiments. NASA intends {{to use the}} tracking data relay satellite system for operational orbit determination of NASA satellites. Hence, in the near future, satellite-to-satellite tracking data will be routinely processed to obtain orbits. The satellite-to-satellite tracking system used in the ATS- 6 /Nimbus- 6 and ATS- 6 /GEOS- 3 experiments performed with a resolution of 1 to 2 m in range and less than 1 mm/s in range rate for a 10 -s averaging. A Bayesian least squares estimation technique utilizing independent ranging to the <b>synchronous</b> <b>relay</b> <b>satellite</b> {{was determined to be}} the most effective procedure for estimating orbits from satellite-to-satellite tracking data. The use of this technique yields estimates of user satellite orbits which are comparable in accuracy to what is usually obtained from ground based systems...|$|E

The concept of a <b>satellite</b> <b>relay</b> introduces certain immediately apparent operational advantages over airborne relays. However, a requirement that the <b>satellite</b> <b>relay</b> be transparent to the basic JTIDS waveform, i. e., same carrier frequency and modulation, introduces some unique satellite repeater design problems. These problems, and their associated system design trade-offs, are discussed along with a potentially feasible design solution. Also, since the JTIDS TDMA format is designed for LOS propagation times, some unique network timing and control problems are introduced by the utilization of a <b>synchronous</b> <b>satellite</b> <b>relay.</b> Therefore, solutions which are transparent to the basic JTIDS waveform and terminal design, while compatible with a satellite network, are also discussed in the paper, along with a candidate baseline solution...|$|R

The ATS-F S-band Telemetry, Tracking and Command Experiment is {{designed}} to develop and demonstrate critical aspects of the technology necessary to an operational tracking and data <b>relay</b> <b>satellite</b> (TDRS) system {{within the framework of}} NASA's existing applications flight programs.

The issue of the dynamic <b>relay</b> <b>satellite</b> scheduling, which focuses on assigning time resource to user tasks, {{has been an important}} concern in the TDRSS system. In this paper, the focus of study is on the dynamic <b>relay</b> <b>satellite</b> scheduling, whose detailed process consists of two steps: the initial <b>relay</b> <b>satellite</b> scheduling and the selection of dynamic scheduling schemes. To solve the dynamic scheduling problem, a new scheduling algorithm ABC-TOPSIS is proposed, which combines artificial bee colony (ABC) and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). The artificial bee colony algorithm is performed to solve the initial <b>relay</b> <b>satellite</b> scheduling. In addition, the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution is adopted for the selection of dynamic scheduling schemes. Plenty of simulation results are presented.
