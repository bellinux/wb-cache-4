The ARC collaborated with the Rainbow Centre over a period of five months to renovate the temporary campus, recruit school staff, decide on the school values and develop the school programmes. After opening in 2004 with 10 teachers and 41 students, Pathlight School conducted charity walks, merchandise sales and other events to raise funds for the introduction of more programmes for an expanding intake. In 2007, two teachers from Pathlight School won the inaugural Most Outstanding <b>Special</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Teacher</b> Award and Most Innovative <b>Special</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Teacher</b> Award, given by the Singaporean Ministry of Education and National Council of Social Service. In 2009, the Autism Association of Singapore {{launched a}} second autism-focused special school, Eden School, and the two schools formed a partnership. The following year, Pathlight School moved to its permanent campus and announced plans to develop student internship programmes, build an information technology centre, and set up a lifelong learning club for alumni.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} how schools identify primary school children with early reading difficulties and what kind of early intervention <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> use to support these students. This study also investigates early interventions that <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> con­sider to be effective. Ten <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> were interviewed regarding early intervention. The result showed that the schools use several screenings from within the age group of 6 - 9 year olds. The <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> can at an early stage identify primary school children with difficulties in their reading and they use a range of different interventions. It is found in this study that an intense period of individual tuition is the intervention that most <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> think leads to good results for primary school children with difficulties in their early reading. That finding is also supported in previous research. It is clear that <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> and <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> need more time for early intervention.

40|$|In this diploma thesis I {{researched}} the working satisfaction {{and views of}} mobile <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> towards team work. In the introductory part I defined what working satisfaction is, I described the work of mobile <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers,</b> I defined team work at school and described the role of mobile <b>special</b> <b>education</b> teachers' views. In the research I established how satisfied mobile <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> are at their work, what are their positions and views towards team work, how often they carry out the individual stages of team work, and what – according to their opinion – the advantages of team work are for themselves, for students and for teachers. The total of 102 mobile <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> participated in the research. I gathered the data through a questionnare and I used the SPSS statistical software for the processing {{of the results of}} the questionnaire. I established that mobile <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> are often satisfied with the professional and personal development at their workplace. They are somewhat less satisfied, or only occasionally satisfied, with the approval and the recognition they get for their achievements and with the options for promotion. In general, mobile <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> are positively inclined towards team work, whilst the analysis results showed that those mobile <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> with ample experience and/or longer time in service are not as positively inclined towards teamwork as those who are less experienced. I was interested in the difference in the frequency of carrying out certain stages of team work with regard to the views of mobile <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> towards it. The results showed that there are no statistically significant discrepancies amongst the variables considered. The research also showed that the majority of the respondents - mobile <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> – plan their lessons in a team on a weekly basis, i. e. several times per month; almost half of them have lessons in a team only occasionally; whilst the team evaluation of lessons is performed by less than a quarter of mobile <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> several times a month, and by even a smaller percentage on a daily basis. Among the advantages of team work the respondents most often highlighted mutual cooperation and team work with teachers which according to them contributes to the provision of better and more appropriate support, also of higher quality, to the students with special needs...|$|R
40|$|<b>Special</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> {{are under}} {{tremendous}} pressure {{to deliver a}} personalized educational experience to special needs children while, at the same time, operating within an equal opportunity, politically driven educational system. Urban teachers are under even more constraints since urban public schools do not typically have the resources, materials, and support from parents needed to deliver the best possible educational experience to students. In 2000, Coleman suggested that caseloads followed closely by paperwork are the biggest concerns of <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers.</b> This author further suggests that, on average, <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> prepare fifty lessons per day for special needs children, and spend one to two days per week managing paperwork. Budgetary constraints in urban schools further place obstacles in front of <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> who must make do with materials and training that are incomplete or out of date. Professional challenges may be the reason behind a lack of <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> in urban areas, {{and the fact that}} the demand for <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> was outpacing the number of <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> entering the field. The purpose of this study is to explore five research questions that examine the antecedents to an urban elementary <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>teacher's</b> intentions to leave the <b>special</b> <b>education</b> profession. Five professional challenges were developed from extant literature to test their influence on job satisfaction and three constructs from the theory of planned behavior. Job satisfaction and these three constructs were tested for their predictive validity influencing a subject's behavior intention to leave the profession. Using a non-random, purposeful sample of 79 certified <b>special</b> <b>education</b> <b>teachers</b> in urban Texan school districts, a quantitative method using multiple regression was used to test nine correlations. Results suggest that professional challenges significantly influence job satisfaction and perceived behavioral control from the theory of planned behavior. Behavior intention to leave the profession was significantly influenced by job satisfaction, attitudes about leaving the profession, and perceived behavioral control. Attitudes about leaving the profession were significantly influenced by job satisfaction. The subjective norms construct was not a significant predictor of behavior intention, and neither attitude nor subjective norms was influenced by professional challenges...|$|R
