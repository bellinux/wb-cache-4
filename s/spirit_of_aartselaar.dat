50|$|Martin Delrio {{was never}} destined {{for one of}} the {{religious}} orders. His family had originally destined him for a political career. His law degree from Salamanca was part of this requirement. The Spanish crown since the days of Catholic Monarchs had particularly valued such degrees. Equally valued were titles of nobility. A legacy left by Martin’s grandfather was used to buy him the title <b>of</b> Lord <b>of</b> <b>Aartselaar.</b> On 7 September 1561, at the age of 10, Martin Delrio made his official entry, swearing an oath in which he promised to protect widows and orphans. The Delrio family also paid host to a number of prominent figures on visits to Antwerp, including Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle and Anne of Austria, Queen of Spain, Philip II’s fourth wife.|$|R

50|$|Many {{years before}} the events in Beyond Oasis, the warrior Ordan gives his young pupil Leon the Golden Armlet, {{so that he can}} become the <b>Spirit</b> King <b>of</b> Oasis.

Leon's nemesis is the evil wizard Agito who has the Silver Armlet and threatens to destroy the land.|$|R
60|$|But {{the text}} {{describes}} this Spirit in different words.

60|$|If the <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> {{love is the}} <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> God, and the <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> {{wisdom is}} the <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> God, then they must be the same spirit.

50|$|The {{vessel was}} built in 2005 to run {{alongside}} the similar <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> Gosport, she is primarily for cruising Portsmouth Harbour and the Solent. This enabled <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> Gosport to replace Portsmouth Queen on the Gosport to Portsmouth ferry route. The main {{difference between the two}} Spirit vessels is the covered roof and bar on <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> Portsmouth, making her more suited to cruising. <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> Portsmouth however, services the ferry route when either <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> Gosport or the other ferry Harbour <b>Spirit</b> are out <b>of</b> service.|$|R
50|$|Many {{indigenous}} and tribal cultures {{around the world}} are deeply concerned with <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> place in their landscape. <b>Spirits</b> <b>of</b> place are explicitly recognized by some of the world's main religions: Shinto has its Kami which may incorporate <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> place; Christianity has <b>spirits</b> <b>of</b> place in the Angelic Choirs of Dominions and Principalities, Hinduism, Vajrayana and Bonpo traditions.|$|R

60|$|He is the <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> {{boundless}} {{love and}} charity, {{which is the}} <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> the Father, and the <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> the Son likewise.

5|$|What {{then is the}} <b>spirit</b> <b>of</b> liberty? I cannot define it; I {{can only}} tell you my own faith.

25|$|Christians {{believe that}} the Holy Spirit gives 'gifts' to Christians. These gifts consist of {{specific}} abilities granted to the individual Christian. They are frequently known by the Greek word for gift, Charisma, from which the term charismatic derives. The New Testament provides three different lists of such gifts which range from the supernatural (healing, prophecy, tongues) through those associated with specific callings (teaching) to those expected of all Christians in some degree (faith). Most consider these lists not to be exhaustive, and other have compiled their own lists. Saint Ambrose wrote of the Seven Gifts <b>of</b> the Holy <b>Spirit</b> poured out on a believer at baptism: 1. <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> Wisdom; 2. <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> Understanding; 3. <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> Counsel; 4. <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> Strength; 5. <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> Knowledge; 6. <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> Godliness; 7. <b>Spirit</b> <b>of</b> Holy Fear.|$|R
