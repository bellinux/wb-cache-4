6000|$|Just before little Gertie {{reached the}} station, Sam {{happened}} {{to be engaged in}} attempting to take his dinner. We use the word attempting advisedly, because our signalman had not the ghost of a chance to sit down, as ordinary mortals do, and take his dinner with any degree of certainty. He took it as it were, disjointedly in the midst of alarms. That the reader may understand why, we must observe that the [...] "block system" [...] of signalling, which had recently been introduced on part of the line, necessitated constant attention, and a series of acts, which gave the signalman no rest, during certain periods of his watch, for more than two minutes at a time, if so long. The block system is the method of protecting trains by [...] "blocking" [...] the line; that is, forbidding the advance of trains until the line is clear, thus securing an interval of space between trains, instead of the older and more common method of an interval of time. The chief objection to the latter system is this, that one accident is apt to cause another. Suppose a train despatched from a station; an interval of say quarter of an hour allowed and then another sent off. If the first train should break down, there is some chance of the second train overtaking and running into it. With the block system this is impossible. For instance, a train starts from any station, say A, and has to run past stations B and C. The instant it starts the signalman at A rings a telegraph bell to attract B's attention, {{at the same time he}} indicates on another telegraphic instrument [...] "Train on line," [...] locks his instruments in that position, and puts up the [...] "stop" [...] signal, or, blocks the line. B replies, acknowledging the signal, and telegraphs to C to be ready. The moment the train passes B's station, he telegraphs to C, [...] "Train on line," [...] and blocks that part of the line with the semaphore, [...] "Stop", as A had done, he also telegraphs back to A, [...] "Line clear," [...] whereupon A lets a second train on, if one is ready. Very soon C sends [...] "Line clear" [...] to B, whereupon B is prepared to let on that second train, when it comes up, and so on ad infinitum. The signals, right and left are invariably repeated, so that there is no chance of mistake though the failure of the telegraph instruments, because if any of these should fail, the want of a reply would at once induce a telegram through the [...] "speaking" [...] instrument with which each station is furnished, and which is similar to the telegraph instruments used at most railway stations, and the line would remain [...] "blocked" [...] until a satisfactory answer set it free. The working of the semaphore signals, which are familiar to most people as tall posts with projecting moveable arms, is accomplished by the mechanical action of the [...] "levers" [...] before mentioned. There are two [...] "distant" [...] signals and one [...] "home" [...] signal to be worked by each man. Besides these there are levers for working the various [...] "points" [...] around the station which lead to sidings, and when these levers are in action, i.e. placed for the shunting of a goods train, they <b>self-lock</b> the levers that [...] "block" [...] the line, so that while this operation of shunting (which just means shoving a train to one side out of the way) is going on, the signalman could not make the mistake of letting a train pass the distant signal--the thing is rendered impossible.|$|E

5000|$|The pulley/cam {{system also}} confers a benefit called [...] "let-off". As the string is drawn back, the pulleys rotate. The pulleys are {{eccentric}} rather than round, and so their effective radius changes as they rotate. The pulleys feature two cam tracks. An inner cam track which connects mechanically to the limbs or opposite cam and an outer cam track which the bowstring runs through. As the bow is drawn {{the ratio of}} bowstring pay-out and bowstring take-up relative to limb-weight and leverage of the cams changes. By manipulation of the shapes of these cam tracks, different draw-stroke profiles can be created. A compound bow can be soft-drawing with a slow build-up to peak weight and a gradual let-off with a long [...] "valley" [...] at the end. It can also be hard-drawing with a very fast build-up to peak draw-weight, a long plateau where weight is maintained, and a quick let-off with a short valley. The let-off itself {{is the result of}} the cam profiles having passed center and approaching a condition very similar to a cam-lock. In fact some compound bows, if the draw-stops or draw-length modules are removed, will <b>self-lock</b> at full draw and require professional equipment to unlock safely.|$|E

The oil {{condition}} monitor asks for wear derbies {{moving into the}} oil thin cavity stably which is on wear derbies image collecting apparatus, and reduces some phenomena of the wear derbies, such as roll, deposition and <b>self-lock</b> characterization, {{in order to enhance}} the quality of wear derbies image. This paper has first studied about the moving video image of the wear particles in an oil thin cavity. A qualitative research on the movement of the wear derbies, such as roll, deposition and <b>self-lock</b> characterization, has been investigated. Then dynamics of wear derbies is analyzed.

40|$|In the {{microwave}} and millimeter-wave frequency range, solid-state oscillators have limited output power levels. The alternative high-power sources are tubes, which are expensive, bulky, {{have a limited}} lifetime and require high-voltage power supplies. Combining {{a large number of}} low-power solid-state negative resistance devices becomes attractive. In this work a coherent oscillator that can combine thousands of solid-state devices is presented. The feasibility of a reliable high-power, monolithically integrated microwave and millimeter-wave source is demonstrated. In this approach, the active devices load a two-dimensional metal grid that radiates, and the power combining is done in free-space. Several MESFET grid oscillator designs are presented in this thesis, ranging from a 5 by 5 to a 10 by 10 grid in size. The 100 -MESFET hybrid grid oscillator is a planar structure suitable for wafer-scale monolithic integration. This grid locks at 5 GHz, with an ERP of 24 Watts and a conversion efficiency of 20 %. An equivalent embedding circuit for the devices in the grid predicts the oscillation frequency. The devices in the grid <b>self-lock</b> with no external locking signal present, but the grid can also be externally injection-locked. Measurements and analysis are presented for the injection-locked planar grid oscillator...|$|E
5000|$|The Lego Group {{began in}} the {{workshop}} of Ole Kirk Christiansen (1891-1958), a carpenter from Billund, Denmark, who began making wooden toys in 1932. In 1934, his company {{came to be called}} [...] "Lego", derived from the Danish phrase leg godt, which means [...] "play well". In 1947, Lego expanded to begin producing plastic toys. In 1949 Lego began producing, among other new products, an early version of the now familiar interlocking bricks, calling them [...] "Automatic Binding Bricks". These bricks were based in part on the Kiddicraft <b>Self-Locking</b> Bricks, which were patented in the United Kingdom in 1939 and released in 1947. Lego modified the design of the Kiddicraft brick after examining a sample that they received from the supplier of an injection-molding machine that Lego purchased. The bricks, originally manufactured from cellulose acetate, were a development of the traditional stackable wooden blocks of the time.|$|R

He {{eventually}} worked for the Union Pacific Railroad where he noticed the inefficiency of sealing boxcars. He developed and patented the [...] "Tyden <b>Self-Locking</b> Seal," [...] a tamper-proof device that fit any boxcar locking mechanism. [...] He made a fortune from his invention, opening a factory in Hastings, Michigan. While remaining in Hastings Tyden began to acquire farms in North Central Iowa in 1915, and his holdings grew to almost 2500 acre. He hired resident farm managers and hired hands to operate each farm. Tyden modernized the farms and employed [...] "new agriculture" [...] methods espoused by Iowa State College in Ames that made extensive use {{of science and technology}} to improve farming methods and production. [...] He continued to maintain and expand his holdings during the economic downturn in farming in the 1920s and the Great Depression. Tyden bought this farm in 1936, and began making improvements. In 1941 he released all his employees after the harvest and leased the farms out to farmers to run as they saw fit. Tyden died in 1951. He still owned Farm No. 6, and it remained in the family until 1994. [...] The farm is now part of the Silos & Smokestacks National Heritage Area and houses farming exhibits and tours.|$|R
40|$|Purpose. One of key {{requirements}} for rolling stock of next generation is essential increase of warranty period or running between maintenance depots and in periods between programming repair works. This {{will lead to}} a reduction of costs to maintenance and repair during service life of rolling stock. In this regard, the industry aspires to use (during construction, repairs, modernization of rolling stock) a modern screw joints in structures for fixing parts. These screw joints could provide a high reliability under the action of vibration load. FS-hexagon all-metal <b>self-lock</b> nuts of multiple use, Flaig + Hommel GmbH company meets these requirements. Therefore, there is the need to consider the results of tests to confirm the reliability of FS-nuts in the new environment. Methodology. Test complex of developed programs and methods was carried out on railway rolling stock for functional demonstration of screw joints with FS-nuts. These tests include: 1) proof test and locking moment test as specified in ISO 2320 under normal climatic conditions and after low temperatures impact; 2) running test for rolling stock, secured the most load condition and according to supervised operation of next generation cars on the railway. Findings. Results of the tests testify that FS-all-metal <b>self-lock</b> nuts meet the requirements of international standards and confirm the reliability of the next generation rolling stock during its operation on the railway of 1520 mm gauge. Namely, locking moment and tightening torque is maintained in screw joints both on spring-suspended and unspring parts of freight car bogies by the action of vibration load under multiple use of FS-nuts. Originality. The developed software and methods was improved by conducting additional tests after exposure of screw joints with FS-nuts to low temperatures, as well as by control operations for assessing the condition of screw joints with FS-nuts, in the conditions of controlled operation of rolling stock. It fully allows confirming the reliability of the FS-nuts on the rolling stock of 1520 mm gauge railways. Practical value. Application of FS-nuts makes it possible to stop using secondary members in screw joints of railway rolling stock of 1520 mm gauge. These secondary members are used for reaction to slacking under vibration and consist of castle nuts, retaining washers, locking washers, serrated washers, check plates, disposable clamps. Using FS-nuts allow providing the rating rules for next generation of rolling stock. Besides the modern technologies of FS-nuts production provide their prolonged running time under the conditions of pollution, humidity, differential temperature and other adverse factors...|$|E
40|$|Electro-Mechanical Dual Acting Pulley Continuously Variable Transmission (EMDAP CVT) is a {{transmission}} operated by electro-mechanical actuated system. It has a potential to reduce energy consumption where power is only needed during changing of CVT ratio and no additional power {{is needed to}} maintain the CVT ratio due to <b>self-lock</b> mechanism design feature of the EMDAP CVT. In this research, simulation of an EMDAP CVT model was first performed in order to evaluate controller system performance using MATLAB/Simulink software package. Then, confirmation of the simulation results is made by experimental data that is being measured from EMDAP CVT test rig. In order to obtain adequate performance, basic Proportional Integral Derivative (PID), Proportional Derivative (PD) and Proportional Derivative with Conditional Integral (PDCI) controller schemes were proposed to control EMDAP CVT ratio. Relay feedback and Ziegler-Nichols methods were utilized to tune the PID based controller parameters. From simulation analysis, the basic PID based controller shows a huge overshoot up to 280 % and it takes very long settling time up to 65 seconds. However, this controller generates very small steady state error which is around 0. 2 %. The PD controller shows better performance {{where there is no}} overshoot occurred and faster settling time, i. e. 8 seconds, but steady state error is a bit higher, i. e. 3. 2 %, than the basic PID based controller. The best performance is predicted by PDCI controller where it shows maximum overshoot at 0. 2 %, 8 seconds in settling time and steady state error at 0. 1 %. In the experimental work, only PD and PDCI controller schemes are adopted because of their good control performance in the simulation. It is found that performance of the PD and PDCI controllers in the experiments are quite close to those predicted in the simulation. For the PD controller, experimental results show no overshoot, it takes only 4 seconds in settling time and produces steady state error of 10 %. As for the PDCI controller, it shows 1 % in maximum overshoot, 8 seconds in settling time and steady state error at 1 %. This indicates that the PDCI controller is superior than the PD controller in terms of steady state error and this is confirmed by simulation and experimental results...|$|E
