25|$|A {{variation}} of the Dutch Auction {{has been used to}} take a number of U.S. companies public including Morningstar, Interactive Brokers Group, Overstock.com, Ravenswood Winery, Clean Energy Fuels, and Boston Beer Company. In 2004, Google used the Dutch Auction system for its Initial Public Offering. Traditional U.S. investment banks have shown resistance to the idea of using an auction process to engage in public securities offerings. The auction method allows for equal access to the allocation of shares and eliminates the favorable treatment accorded important clients by the underwriters in conventional IPOs. In the face of this resistance, the Dutch Auction is <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> used method in U.S. public offerings, although there have been hundreds of auction IPOs in other countries.|$|E
500|$|The band {{entered the}} Ocean Way Recording studio in Hollywood in February 1989 to record Mother's Milk. [...] "It was weird when I first joined the band because we {{recorded}} the album after I'd {{been in the}} band {{for just a few}} months and Chad had actually been in for just two weeks", Frusciante recalled. [...] "I was <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit confused about my position and we were just like four individuals. Music is all about welding people into a unit and with all the touring we've been doing we're now like an eight armed cosmic octopus!" [...] Beinhorn pushed the Chili Peppers to produce the best possible takes for each of the record's thirteen tracks with the intent of the band obtaining a hit record.|$|E
500|$|Within {{the novel}} itself, {{the title is}} alluded to when Gail Hightower sits at his study window waiting for his {{recurring}} vision of his grandfather's last raid. The vision always occurs in [...] "that instant when all light has failed {{out of the sky}} and it would be night save for that faint light which daygranaried leaf and grass blade reluctant suspire, making <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> light on earth though night itself has come." [...] The story that would eventually become the novel, started by Faulkner in 1931, was originally titled [...] "Dark House" [...] and began with Hightower sitting at a dark window in his home. However, after a casual remark by his wife Estelle {{on the quality of the}} light in August, Faulkner changed the title.|$|E

500|$|The {{appearance}} of Samantha Mulder, {{this time as}} a clone of her from when she was <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl, was due to series creator Chris Carter's desire to bring her back. Carter felt Samantha was {{an important element of}} the show, referring to her as being part of the lifeblood of the series. The decision to kill the character X was made {{at the end of the}} third season. The writers felt that they could only do so much with the character and decided that they would either make him a bigger player on the show, or have him pay the price for collaborating with Fox Mulder. Ultimately they decided on the latter. This led to the introduction of Marita Covarrubias at the end of the episode, Mulder's latest informant.|$|E
500|$|Gary Arnold of The Washington Times {{wrote that}} a number of factors [...] "fail to prevent the {{finished}} product from jamming and misfiring with disillusioning frequency". Arnold opined that [...] "demanding that he [...] play Bond's wrathfulness in a transparently seething and hotheaded manner" [...] means that Dalton [...] "seems to waste away on this second outing as Bond." [...] Overall Arnold sees that there is a [...] "failure to recognize that Bond productions are simply too extravagant to permit an uncompromised return to first principles." [...] The critic for The New York Times, Caryn James, thought Dalton was [...] "the first James Bond with angst, a moody spy for the fin de siecle", and that Licence to Kill [...] "retains its familiar, effective mix of despicably powerful villains, suspiciously tantalizing women and ever-wilder special effects", but was impressed that [...] "Dalton's glowering presence adds a darker tone". James concluded that [...] "for all its clever updatings, stylish action and witty escapism, Licence to Kill... is <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too much by the book." ...|$|E
500|$|Loup is a left-handed pitcher, or southpaw. He {{struggled}} {{at first}} with pitching until minor league pitching instructor Dane Johnson and Dunedin pitching coach Darold Knowles {{told him to}} lower his arm and {{become more of a}} sidearm pitcher. Now, as he pitches, he tracks a plane from his ear to his shoulder, which also helped his effectiveness against left-handed batters. His slider and fastball improved drastically, but his changeup continued to struggle, and Loup says that he is <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> inconsistent with it. He can throw a low-90s [...] "breaking" [...] fastball that is just as effective against right-handed batters as left-handed batters. John Farrell, a previous Toronto Blue Jays manager, said that it was [...] " [...] poise and his presence that allows him to maintain not only composure, but the ability to execute." [...] Blue Jays' bullpen coach Pat Hentgen says that Loup [...] "keeps things simple, he doesn't over-think. He stays aggressive. He's got a lot of guts, goes right after hitters and you combine all those things and you're going to have the success that he's had." [...] One reporter compared Loup to Bran Flakes, stating that [...] "ou know exactly what you're going to get from him every time he takes the mound and he's not going to add any excitement to any situation." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fall {{is usually}} cooler but foggy; {{on some days}} the fog never clears. By early-to-mid November, {{rainfall}} begins in typical Northwest fashion. Winter tends to be chilly and rainy, with occasional violent windstorms or spates of unusually warm——temperatures. This is due to extremely warm air coming from the Pineapple Express which can drop [...] of rain {{in a matter of}} days. Each year there are one or two snowfalls, typically less than [...] but up to [...] in the surrounding foothills. Spring is warmer, but <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> wet; this is the most common time for the occasional thunderstorms.|$|E
2500|$|When {{describing}} {{the feeling of}} portraying a vixen, Budig also used the word fun; she cited her kinship with the character and how it differs from her role on Guiding Light. [...] "Michelle was young and naive. I'm sure I'm <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> naive, but it's hard for an actor who's older to play younger," [...] said Budig. [...] "You {{have to go back}} to being somewhat innocent, and it's hard once you're not to go back to being that way. Greenlee's worldly and naughty, and I can relate more to her [...] not that I'm a naughty girl," [...] she added with humor.|$|E
2500|$|In 1440, in the King's name, an {{invitation}} {{is said to}} have been sent to the young, 16-year-old 6th Earl of Douglas and his little brother, twelve-year-old David, to visit the king at Edinburgh Castle in November 1440. According to legend, they came, and were entertained at the royal table, where James, <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> boy, was charmed by them. However, they were treacherously hurried to their doom, which took place by beheading in the castle yard of Edinburgh on 24 November, with the 10-year-old king pleading for their lives. Three days later Malcolm Fleming of Cumbernauld, their chief adherent, shared the same fate. It is likely the king, being a small child, had nothing to do with this. This infamous incident took the name of [...] "the Black Dinner".|$|E

2500|$|On Tuesday 22 July, the English cavalry, {{divided into}} four battalions, (also {{described}} as battles), finally caught sight of their elusive enemy. [...] The left was commanded by the Earls of Norfolk, Hereford and Lincoln. [...] The right was {{under the command of}} Antony Bek, Bishop of Durham, while the King commanded the centre, <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> distance {{to the rear of the}} vanguard. [...] Once in sight of the enemy, Norfolk and his colleagues began an immediate attack, but on encountering a small marsh to the front of the Scots position, made a long detour to the west before being able to make contact with the right of Wallace's army. [...] Bek tried to hold back his own battalion to give the King time to get into position but he was overruled by his impatient knights, who were anxious to join their comrades on the left in an immediate attack. [...] In a disorganised pell-mell the cavalry finally closed on the Scots, on the right and left. The party of men-at-arms under John Comyn left the field immediately.|$|E
2500|$|Chris Beveridge of Mania gave 2nd GIG {{an overall}} score of A praising its {{coloring}} stating, [...] "Colors are gorgeous and solid, especially {{all the various}} areas of large soft colors that look to be amazingly solid and with no visible break-up even during pausing." [...] Mark Thomas of Mania also gave it an overall score of A, stating: [...] "It has plenty of good action and thought provoking plot points." [...] Andy Patricio of IGN rated the first DVD volume 9/10 praised the animation, stating: [...] "Artwork is richer; this is easily the best-looking anime Production I.G. has ever produced. CG is richer and more widely-used. Animation is more complex and fluid, although it's <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> jerky, which is common in TV shows." [...] Joe Luscik of Animefringe ranked the series 4.5 out of 5 praising the animation stating it [...] "is just awesome". Adam Arseneau of DVD Verdict praised {{the direction of the}} 2nd season compared to the first stating, [...] "The tongue-in-cheek humor that made the show clever and endearing is still present, but the atmosphere feels more violent, more urban and dystopic, as if no longer afraid to address the social problems of the future." ...|$|E
