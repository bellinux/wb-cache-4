5|$|Some of the driest {{land in the}} Everglades is pineland (also called pine rockland) ecosystem, {{located in}} the highest part of the Everglades with little to no hydroperiod. Some floors, however, may have flooded {{solution}} holes or puddles {{for a few months}} at a time. The most significant feature of the pineland is the single species of South Florida <b>slash</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus elliottii). Pineland communities require fire to maintain them, and the trees have several adaptations that simultaneously promote and resist fire. The sandy floor of the pine forest is covered with dry pine needles that are highly flammable. South Florida slash pines are insulated by their bark to protect them from heat. Fire eliminates competing vegetation on the forest floor, and opens pine cones to germinate seeds. A period without significant fire can turn pineland into a hardwood hammock as larger trees overtake the slash pines. The understory shrubs in pine rocklands are the fire-resistant saw palmetto (Serenoa repens), cabbage palm (Sabal palmetto), and West Indian lilac (Tetrazygia bicolor). The most diverse group of plants in the pine community are the herbs, of which there are two dozen species. These plants contain tubers and other mechanisms that allow them to sprout quickly after being charred.|$|E

500|$|Dade County {{was once}} covered in [...] of pine rockland forests, {{but most of}} it was {{harvested}} by the lumber industry. Pineland ecosystems (or pine rocklands) are characterized by shallow, dry sandy loam over a limestone substrate covered almost exclusively by <b>slash</b> <b>pines</b> (Pinus elliottii var. densa). Trees in this ecosystem grow in solution holes, where the soft limestone has worn away and filled with soil, allowing plants to take hold. Pinelands require regular maintenance by fire to ensure their existence. South Florida <b>slash</b> <b>pines</b> are uniquely adapted to promote fire by dropping a large amount of dried pine needles and shedding dry bark. Pine cones require heat from fires to open, allowing seeds to disperse and take hold. The trunks and roots of <b>slash</b> <b>pines</b> are resistant to fire. Prescribed burns in these areas take place every three to seven years; without regular fires, hardwood trees begin to grow in this region and pinelands become recategorized as mixed swamp forests. Most plants in the area bloom about 16 weeks after a fire. Nearly all pinelands have an understory of palm shrubs, and a diverse ground covering of wild herbs.|$|R

This continuous production {{contrasts with the}} bolete's seasonal appearance elsewhere. The fungus is not found in adjacent areas of native vegetation. The fruiting is so bountiful that the harvest of slippery jacks has become the main reason that pine plantations are established or maintained in parts of Ecuador. In southern Brazil, it has been recorded in plantations of <b>slash</b> <b>pine</b> (P.elliottii) in the municipalities of Pelotas, Nova Petrópolis and Canela in Rio Grande do Sul, and Colombo in Paraná.

40|$|Forestry {{operations}} in the Pinelands National Reserve (PNR) produce significant quantities of plant residues, {{commonly referred to as}} flailed slash. The residues consist of needles, bark and wood from a variety of pine species that include: pitch pine, Pinus rigida, virginia pine, Pinus virginiana, and shortleaf pine, Pinus echinata. Currently, the slash material is not being utilized and accumulates as a waste product. A more desirable solution would be to process the flailed <b>pine</b> <b>slash</b> into marketable products to provide landowners with an economic incentive that would encourage better management practices. Three experimental container substrates were produced using flailed <b>pine</b> <b>slash</b> of three different ages combined with mushroom compost and dolomitic limestone. An outdoor container production study was performed using conditions similar to a commercial crop production system. Three species of woody plants were grown in each experimental substrate. Shoot growth was measured by height and dry mass. Experimental substrates were analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity, particle size distribution and bulk density. Flailed <b>pine</b> <b>slash</b> proved to be a successful component of container substrates for woody landscape plant production. Substrates containing 80 % flailed <b>pine</b> <b>slash</b> and 20 % mushroom compost, by volume, that were amended with five pounds of lime per cubic yard of flailed <b>pine</b> <b>slash</b> were able to sustain commercially acceptable plant growth. Substrates containing flailed <b>pine</b> <b>slash,</b> which had been allowed to decompose for three years, produced plants that were statistically better or equal to plants grown in medium commercially available to growers.

Three media contained flailed <b>pine</b> <b>slash</b> that had been allowed to decompose for two years and three additional media contained flailed <b>pine</b> <b>slash</b> that had been allowed to decompose for three years. Batches of these media were un-amended or amended with either sand or perlite producing a total of six different media. After mixing, the experimental propagation media were transferred to 38 round cell propagation trays. Hardwood cuttings of American Cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon cv. Stevens), 7. 6 cm (3 inches) in length, were dipped in a 1000 mg/l IBA solution and inserted individually into cells. Data on percentage of survival, total top growth per flat (measured by length), total number of secondary branches and total number of tertiary branches was collected. No difference in percent survivability was observed. More cranberry shoot growth was observed on un-amended flailed <b>pine</b> <b>slash</b> media and media amended with perlite, when compared to those amended with sand. The number of secondary and tertiary shoots was greatest with the un-amended mixes and the perlite-amended three-year-old flailed <b>pine</b> <b>slash.</b> In this thesis, flailed <b>pine</b> <b>slash</b> was successfully utilized as a propagation medium for hardwood American Cranberry cuttings. The <b>pine</b> <b>slash</b> can be utilized with or without perlite amendment. This research demonstrates that flailed <b>pine</b> <b>slash</b> can be converted into marketable horticultural products with minimal processing and amendment. Utilization of the <b>pine</b> <b>slash</b> material can provide landowners with an economic incentive to encourage better management practices.
