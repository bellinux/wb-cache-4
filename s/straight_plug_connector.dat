5000|$|Modern phone {{connectors}} {{are available}} in three standard sizes. The original [...] in (6.35 mm) version dates from 1878, when it was used for manual telephone exchanges, making it the oldest electrical connector standard still in use, to this day being the most prominent <b>plug</b> <b>connector</b> on mainstream musical equipment, especially on standard electric guitars models.|$|R
50|$|SMC (SubMiniature version C) {{connectors}} are coaxial RF connectors {{developed in}} the 1960s. They use a #10-32 UNF threaded interface (screw type). They offer excellent electrical performance from DC to 10 GHz. Female (a.k.a. <b>plug)</b> SMC <b>connectors</b> have a socket for the center contact, and male (a.k.a. jack) SMC connectors have a pin for the center contact. SMC jack connectors have an external thread while SMC <b>plug</b> <b>connectors</b> have the mating hex nut. Available in 50-Ohm and 75-Ohm characteristic impedance, they provide an interconnect means for small form factor coaxial cables (e.g. 50-Ohm RG-174, 75-Ohm RG-179) and printed circuit boards where small footprint is important.|$|R
50|$|Polybutylene {{terephthalate}} is {{used for}} housings in electrical engineering, but also in automotive construction as <b>plug</b> <b>connectors</b> and in households for example in showerheads or irons. It is also found processed into fibers in toothbrushes, false eyelashes and {{is used in the}} keycaps of some high end computer keyboards because the texture is highly resistant to wear and discoloration due to UV radiation.|$|R
50|$|Increasing use of {{photovoltaic}} systems {{and integration of}} photovoltaic power into existing structures and techniques of supply and distribution increases the value of general standards and definitions for photovoltaic components and systems. The standards are compiled at the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and apply to efficiency, durability and safety of cells, modules, simulation programs, <b>plug</b> <b>connectors</b> and cables, mounting systems, overall efficiency of inverters etc.|$|R
5000|$|The 8P8C modular plugs and jacks {{look very}} similar to the plugs and jacks used for FCC's {{registered}} jack RJ45 variants, although the specified RJ45 socket is not compatible with 8P8C modular <b>plug</b> <b>connectors.</b> It neither uses all eight conductors (but only two of them for wires plus two for connecting a programming resistor) nor does it fit into 8P8C because the true RJ45 is [...] "keyed".|$|R
50|$|Polycyclohexylenedimethylene {{terephthalate}} {{has good}} dimensional stability at excess temperatures (short-term up to 493 °F (256 °C)) making this material suitable for injection molding of thin-walled parts. PCT {{is used for}} electronics components like <b>plug</b> <b>connectors.</b> PCT is also processed into filaments, fibers, and fabrics {{that are used in}} industry as filters. The color stability and lower density are of advantage in other applications, especially in the LED reflector application.|$|R
50|$|Special modular plugs {{have been}} {{manufactured}} (for example, the Siemon UP-2468) which have extra slots beyond their standard contacts, {{to accommodate the}} wider jack's outermost contacts without damage. These special <b>plug</b> <b>connectors</b> can be visually identified by carefully looking for the extra slots molded into the plug. The molded plastic bodies of the special plugs may also be colored with a light blueish tinge, to aid in quick recognition.|$|R
5000|$|The {{coupling}} system is usually made of two bayonet ramps machined on the external {{side of the}} receptacle connector and 2 stainless steel studs mounted inside the <b>plug</b> <b>connector’s</b> coupling nut. Several classes of electrical cable connectors, including audio, video, and data cables use bayonet connectors. Examples include BNC, C, and ST connectors. (The BNC connector is not exactly as described in this article, as the male, not female, connector has the slots and spring.) ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Plug</b> <b>connectors</b> {{that are}} not made by MC but can may be mated with MC {{elements}} and are sometimes also described by their manufacturers as [...] "MC compatible", do NOT conform to the requirements for a safe electrical connection with long term stability and for safety reasons may not be plugged together with MC elements. MC therefore accept no liability if these connectors which are not approved by MC are mated with MC elements.|$|R

50|$|Cables with a C13 {{connector}} {{at one end}} and a type E <b>plug</b> <b>connector</b> at {{the other}} are commonly available. They have a variety of common uses including connecting power between older PCs and their monitors, extending existing power cords, connecting to type F outlets strips (commonly used with rack-mount gear to save space and for international standardization) and connecting computer equipment to the output of a uninterruptible power supply (UPS). Type J outlets are used in a similar way.|$|R
5000|$|Serial ATA power {{connector}}s: a 15-pin connector {{for components}} which use SATA power <b>plugs.</b> This <b>connector</b> supplies power at three different voltages: +3.3, +5, and +12 V.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Base" [...] Camera Link {{configuration}} carries signals over {{a single}} connector/cable. The cable used is a MDR ("Mini D Ribbon") 26-pin Male <b>Plug</b> <b>Connector,</b> optimized by 3M for the LVDS signal. In {{addition to the}} 5 LVDS pairs transmitting the serialized video data (24 bits of data and 4 framing/enable bits), the connector also carries 4 LVDS discrete control signals and 2 LVDS asynchronous serial communication channels for communicating with the camera. At the maximum chipset operating frequency (85 MHz), the base configuration yields a video data throughput of 2.04 Gbit/s (255 MB/s).|$|R

5000|$|A casual {{glance at}} a USB [...] "Type A" [...] <b>plug</b> <b>connector</b> may give the false {{impression}} that it is hermaphroditic. However, a physical attempt to mate two USB [...] "Type A" [...] cables with each other reveals {{the fact that the}} connectors will not interconnect. Classifying according to mathematical graph theory, USB buses are directed trees, whereas FireWire buses have a true bus network topology. This difference is reflected in the bus connectors used, in that USB cables are asymmetrical (one end Type A, other end Type B) while FireWire cables may have identical connectors at both ends.|$|R
50|$|Users {{would bring}} their Apple IIe {{machines}} into an authorized dealership, where the IIe motherboard and lower baseboard {{of the case}} were swapped for an Apple IIGS motherboard with a new baseboard. New metal sticker ID badges replaced those {{on the front of}} the Apple IIe, rebranding the machine. Retained were the upper half of the IIe case, the keyboard, speaker, and power supply. Original IIGS motherboards (those produced between 1986 and mid-1989) have electrical connections for the IIe power supply and keyboard present, although only about half produced have the physical <b>plug</b> <b>connectors</b> factory pre-soldered in.|$|R
5000|$|IEC 62196-1 is {{applicable}} to <b>plugs,</b> socket-outlets, <b>connectors,</b> inlets and cable assemblies for electric vehicles, {{intended for use}} in conductive charging systems which incorporate control means, with a rated operating voltage not exceeding: ...|$|R
50|$|Several {{non-standard}} sockets {{are designed}} to mate with standard mini-DIN <b>plugs.</b> These <b>connectors</b> provide extra conductors, and are used to save space by combining functions in one connector that would otherwise require two standard connectors.|$|R

50|$|Opto-isolator sensors are {{completely}} encased to prevent ingress {{from the outside}} environment. The only exposed parts are a sealed <b>plug</b> <b>connector</b> and a drive fork, which {{is attached to a}} slotted disk internally through a bearing and seal. The slotted disk is typically sandwiched between two circuit boards containing a photo-diode, photo-transistor, amplifier, and filtering circuits which produce a square wave pulse train output customized to the customers voltage and pulses per revolution requirements. These types of sensors typically provide 2 to 8 independent channels of output that can be sampled by other systems in the vehicle such as automatic train control systems and propulsion/braking controllers.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{ambiguous}} situation arises {{with the}} connectors used for USB, FireWire (IEEE-1394), HDMI, and Thunderbolt serial data bus connections. Close examination of these connectors {{reveals that the}} contact [...] "pins" [...] are not actually pins, but instead are conductive surfaces that slide past each other when they mate. Therefore, the traditional pin and socket nomenclature is not applicable. Instead, most computer hardware people fall back to referring to the wrap-around metal shield on the <b>plug</b> <b>connector</b> {{as if it were}} a connector pin. By this convention, the connectors on serial bus cables are [...] "male plugs", and the corresponding connectors on equipment are [...] "female jacks".|$|R
50|$|While {{through-hole}} mounting provides strong mechanical bonds {{when compared}} to SMT techniques, the additional drilling required makes the boards more expensive to produce. They also limit the available routing area for signal traces on layers immediately below the top layer on multilayer boards since the holes must pass through all layers to the opposite side. To that end, through-hole mounting techniques are now usually reserved for bulkier or heavier components such as electrolytic capacitors or semiconductors in larger packages such as the TO220 that require the additional mounting strength, or for components such as <b>plug</b> <b>connectors</b> or electromechanical relays that require great strength in support.|$|R

50|$|Field-mountable {{optical fiber}} {{connectors}} {{are used to}} join optical fiber jumper cables that contain one singlemode fiber. These assemblies can be separated into two major categories: single-jointed connector assemblies and multiple-jointed connector assemblies. According to Telcordia GR-1081, a single-jointed connector assembly is a connector assembly where {{there is only one}} spot where two different fibers are joined together. This is the situation generally found when connector assemblies are made from factory-assembled optical fiber <b>connector</b> <b>plugs.</b> A multiple-jointed <b>connector</b> assembly is a connector assembly where {{there is more than one}} closely spaced connection joining different fibers together. An example of a multiple-jointed connector assembly is a connector assembly that uses the stub-fiber type of <b>connector</b> <b>plug.</b>|$|R
40|$|The 9157 {{series was}} {{specifically}} designed for portable equipment. AVX now offers this two-part system as a standard product. The fixed SMT socket {{is designed to be}} housed within the confined dimensional constraints of the portable device. The plug/cover connector has sprung contacts and is designed for termination to acces-sory equipment. The connector is designed to house fifteen signal contacts on a 1 mm pitch rated at 1. 5 A. There is the option to include a switching RF coax. A cradle SMT <b>plug</b> <b>connector</b> for docking applications is also available asstandard and has the option of including a SMT RF coax.
