Briefly, mice received a single p.o. administration of vehicle-control or doxycycline (2 [*]mg); 24 [*]h later, mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane, and the lateral tail vein was cannulated for the i.v. administration of 18 F-ICMT- 11 or 18 F-ML- 10 (1.3 [*]±[*] 0.2 [*]MBq per mouse). Mice were allocated to two groups: (1) control and (2) doxycycline (n[*]=[*] 6 mice per group for each radiotracer). One hour after radiotracer administration, mice were sacrificed and <b>select</b> <b>tissues</b> were excised, and radioactivity was measured by ex vivo gamma counting in these <b>select</b> <b>tissues</b> (Wizard 2480 Automatic Gamma Counter, Perkin Elmer).

30|$|As stated earlier, {{this study}} {{was a matter of}} {{reconnaissance}} and discovery related {{to the question of whether}} Se would be found in the whole bodies of fish throughout the Fountain Creek watershed and if so, to what extent was the accumulation? (However, not anticipated was finding mercury in all fish). Our initial plan was to collect, as much as possible, a single fish species from 14 sites for comparisons of contamination by site, or at least, comparison of stream segments; however, collecting a single species was not possible because upper Fountain and Monument Creeks begin as cold water streams with markedly different assemblages of fish. Therefore, this report will focus on baseline data for selenium and mercury in the tissues of brown trout, a cold-water species and five warm-water species plus an initial study on the localization of Se and Hg in four <b>selected</b> <b>tissues</b> including the ovaries. We were not able to subject the data to rigorous statistical analysis but we were able to indicate trends of tissue-Se and tissue-Hg in fish whole bodies and <b>selected</b> <b>tissues.</b> We used regression analysis to determine whether a direct or inverse relationship existed between concentrations of Se and Hg in the whole bodies of fish at the 14 sites.|$|E

The major objective of iodine biofortification of plants is to obtain food rich in this trace element, which may increase its consumption by various populations. Additionally, it may reduce the risk of iodine deficiency diseases. In this research {{for the first time we}} have assessed the bioavailability of iodine from raw or cooked carrot biofortified with this trace element on iodine concentration in <b>selected</b> <b>tissues</b> and various biochemical parameters as well as mRNA expression of some genes involved in iodine metabolism in Wistar rats. Statistically, a significantly higher iodine level was determined in urine, faeces and <b>selected</b> <b>tissues</b> of rats fed a diet containing biofortified raw carrot as compared to a diet without iodine and a diet containing control cooked carrot. Biofortified raw carrot significantly increased triiodothyronine concentration as compared to animals from other experimental groups. The highest thyroid stimulating hormone level was determined in rats fed control cooked carrots. mRNA expression of selected genes was affected by different dietary treatment in rats' hearts. Biofortified raw and cooked carrot could be taken into account as a potential source of iodine in daily diets to prevent iodine deficiency in various populations...|$|E

Quail egg had been described as being very functional biochemically, due to the essential biomolecules it contains in very regulated quantity. This study was aimed for evaluating the dietary effect of the egg on lipid profile parameters on <b>selected</b> <b>tissues.</b> The antilipidemic properties of the egg yolk and albumen and poultry (layers) feed were determined in <b>selected</b> <b>tissues</b> in male albino rats assaulted with cold immobilization stress induced on them at 4 °C for 2 hours, while diazepam was used as standard antistress drug. Antilipidemic activities were evaluated by lipid profile modulation (HDL, LDL, TRIG., and T-CHOL.).

5000|$|... 5α-Reductase inhibitors such as {{finasteride}} and dutasteride are inhibitors of 5α-reductase, {{an enzyme}} {{that is responsible}} for the formation of DHT from testosterone. DHT is between 2.5- and 10-fold more potent than testosterone as an androgen and is produced in a tissue-selective manner based on expression of 5α-reductase. Tissues in which DHT is formed at a high rate include the prostate gland, skin, and hair follicles. In accordance, DHT is involved in the pathophysiology of benign prostatic hyperplasia, androgenic alopecia, and hirsutism, and 5α-reductase inhibitors are used to treat these conditions. Because 5α-reductase inhibitors selectively prevent the formation of DHT and do not affect testosterone levels, and because DHT is important as an endgenous androgen only in <b>select</b> <b>tissues,</b> 5α-reductase inhibitors have minimal side effects in both men and women, unlike other antiandrogens.|$|R
