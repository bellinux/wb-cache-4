50|$|The <b>streaked</b> <b>xenops</b> builds its nest {{by simply}} placing a few stems and roots {{in a hole}} 5-15 ft (1.5-4.5 m) high in a tree. The normal clutch is two white eggs, {{incubated}} by both sexes.|$|E

50|$|The <b>streaked</b> <b>xenops</b> (Xenops rutilans) is a {{passerine}} bird which breeds in {{the tropical}} New World from Costa Rica and Trinidad south to Bolivia and northern Argentina. Like the closely related true woodcreepers, it {{is a member of}} the South American bird family Furnariidae.|$|E
50|$|The <b>streaked</b> <b>xenops</b> is {{typically}} 4.8 in (12.2 cm) long, weighs 0.44 oz (12.6 g), {{and has a}} stubby wedge-shaped bill. The head is dark brown with a whitish supercilium and malar stripe. The upperparts are brown, becoming rufous on the tail and rump, {{and there is a}} buff bar on the darker brown wings. The underparts are white-streaked olive brown. Males and females looks alike. Visually inconspicuous, it is easier located by its chattering call, a series of 5 or 6 metallic zeet notes.|$|E
50|$|The {{plain xenops}} is {{typically}} 12 cm long, weighs 12 g, {{and has a}} stubby wedge-shaped bill. The head is light brown with a buff supercilium and whitish malar stripe. The upperparts are brown, becoming rufous on the tail and rump, {{and there is a}} buff bar on the darker brown wings. The underparts are unstreaked pale olive brown. The sexes are similar, but young birds have dark brown throats. The lack of streaking is an obvious distinction from other xenops especially <b>streaked</b> <b>xenops.</b> It is also the only lowland species in the genus.|$|E
50|$|It {{is found}} in wet forests in foothills and {{mountains}} between 2,000-7,200 ft (600-2,200 m) ASL, and will utilize secondary forests and opened-up growth. The <b>streaked</b> <b>xenops</b> {{is often difficult to}} see as it forages on bark, rotting stumps or bare twigs; it moves in all directions on the trunk like a treecreeper, but does not use its tail as a prop. It feeds on arthropods such as the larvae of wood-boring beetles, but can also catch flying termites in mid-air. It joins mixed-species feeding flocks on a more or less regular basis depending on location, usually moving through the middle levels of the forest.|$|E
