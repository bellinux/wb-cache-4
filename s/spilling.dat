However, our examination of data on large <b>spills</b> in recent years indicates that pipelines are a much more significant <b>spill</b> source in inland waters than vessels. Recent reports also indicate that large <b>spills</b> of crude oil often occur in inland areas. Finally, although coastal <b>spills</b> tend to be highly publicized, the majority of large oil <b>spills</b> in the United States are to inland areas. <b>Spills</b> to inland areas often affect sensitive environments and can have greater impacts to public health and welfare than <b>spills</b> to coastal areas.

The results show that oil <b>spill</b> responses in different countries and regions of the world vary considerably in their costs most likely due to differences in cultural values, socio-economic factors, and labor costs.

40|$|Overall, oil {{spillage}} from vessels throughout the US has decreased significantly since 1990 and {{the enactment of}} the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90).

The reporting of smaller <b>spills</b> has increased since 1985, but the incidence of these <b>spills</b> has decreased since 1990. The reasons for <b>spill</b> reductions with OPA 90 are varied and complex. There are reductions noted even before some of the prevention measures associated with OPA 90 have been implemented. There is speculation that these <b>spill</b> reductions {{may be related to the}} increasing costs of oil <b>spills</b> and unlimited liability, and the resulting greater “care ” that vessel owners and operators are exercising, as well as the higher class of vessels transiting US waters based on financial and insurance requirements.

5|$|As they {{sail for}} Greenland, strange things begin {{to happen to}} the ships bearing the {{tourmaline}} veils. Marine life and sea birds of all kinds are attracted towards them, and crew stationed aboard them for too long begin acting intoxicated and amorous. The plant and animal life attracted to the ships experiences rapid growth, so that before they reach Greenland the ships look more like mountains or meadows than ships. Strange sea creatures never before seen appear around the ships, and when the expedition is ready to deploy the tourmaline veils, they have to cut through the riot of organic growth that has totally filled the ships. Once the energy of the veils is unleashed on Greenland, it melts the ice quickly but also has unanticipated effects. Prehistoric bones and plant remains that were buried under the ice are reanimated, and fuse together into monstrous forms made up of plant, animal, and mineral parts. Greenland, free of its icy burden, rises up, ripping from north to south in the process and becoming two separate islands.

40|$|<b>Spill</b> {{prevention}} is prudent both economically and environmentally, because <b>spills</b> increase operating costs and lower productivity. An important tool in preventing <b>spills</b> is a <b>Spill</b> Prevention Plan. A <b>Spill</b> Prevention Plan specifies materials handling procedures and storage requirements and identifies <b>spill</b> cleanup procedures for areas and processes in which <b>spills</b> may potentially occur. The plan standardizes process operating procedures and employee training {{in an effort}} to minimize accidental pollutant releases that could contaminate storm water runoff. <b>Spill</b> prevention should be part of a comprehensive Best Management Practice program to prevent runoff contamination. This program should also include storm water contamination assessment, flow diversion, record keeping, internal reporting, employee training, and preventive maintenance. Typically, most businesses and public agencies that generate hazardous waste and/or produce, transport, or store petroleum products are required by State and federal law to prepare <b>spill</b> control and cleanup plans. Therefore, a <b>Spill</b> Prevention and Response Plan may have already been developed as a result of other environmental regulatory requirements. Existing plans should be re-evaluated and revised to address storm water management issues. APPLICABILITY A <b>Spill</b> Prevention Plan is applicable to facilities that transport, transfer, and/or store hazardous materials, petroleum products, or fertilizers that can contaminate storm water runoff. An important part of an effective <b>Spill</b> Prevention Plan is establishing a method for quick notification of the appropriate emergency response teams {{in the event of a}} <b>spill.</b> In some plants, each area or process may have a separate team leader and/or response team.
