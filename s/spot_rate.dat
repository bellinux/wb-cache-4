5|$|The {{empirical}} {{rejection of}} the unbiasedness hypothesis is a well-recognized puzzle among finance researchers. Empirical evidence for cointegration between the forward rate and the future <b>spot</b> <b>rate</b> is mixed. Researchers have published papers demonstrating empirical failure of the hypothesis by conducting regression analyses of the realized changes in spot exchange rates on forward premiums and finding negative slope coefficients. These researchers offer numerous rationales for such failure. One rationale centers around the relaxation of risk neutrality, while still assuming rational expectations, such that a foreign exchange risk premium may exist that can account for differences between the forward rate and the future <b>spot</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|E

Given strong evidence that CIRP holds, the forward rate unbiasedness hypothesis {{can serve as a}} test to determine whether UIRP holds (in order for the forward rate and <b>spot</b> <b>rate</b> to be equal, both CIRP and UIRP conditions must hold). Evidence for the validity and accuracy of the unbiasedness hypothesis, particularly evidence for cointegration between the forward rate and future <b>spot</b> <b>rate,</b> is mixed as researchers have published numerous papers demonstrating both empirical support and empirical failure of the hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|Economists {{have found}} {{empirical}} evidence that covered interest rate parity generally holds, though not with precision {{due to the}} effects of various risks, costs, taxation, and ultimate differences in liquidity. When both covered and uncovered interest rate parity hold, they expose a relationship suggesting that the forward rate is an unbiased predictor of the future <b>spot</b> <b>rate.</b> This relationship can be employed to test whether uncovered interest rate parity holds, for which economists have found mixed results. When uncovered interest rate parity and purchasing power parity hold together, they illuminate a relationship named real interest rate parity, which suggests that expected real interest rates represent expected adjustments in the real exchange rate. This relationship generally holds strongly over longer terms and among emerging market countries.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the recent literature on Foreign Exchange Market Microstructure. Its aim is not to survey the literature, but rather to provide an introductory tour to the main theoretical ideas and empirical results. The central theoretical idea is that trading {{is an integral part of}} the process through which information relevant to the pricing of foreign currency becomes embedded in <b>spot</b> <b>rates.</b> Micro-based models study this information aggregation process and produce a rich set of empirical predictions that find strong support in the data. In particular, micro-based models can account for a large proportion of the daily variation in <b>spot</b> <b>rates.</b> They also supply a rationale for the apparent disconnect between <b>spot</b> <b>rates</b> and fundamentals. In terms of forecasting, micro-based models provide out-of-sample forecasting power for <b>spot</b> <b>rates</b> that is an order of magnitude above that usually found in exchange-rate models.

5|$|The forward {{exchange}} rate (also referred to as forward rate or forward price) is the exchange rate at which a bank agrees to exchange one currency for another at a future date when it enters into a forward contract with an investor. Multinational corporations, banks, and other financial institutions enter into forward contracts {{to take advantage of}} the forward rate for hedging purposes. The {{forward exchange}} rate is determined by a parity relationship among the spot exchange rate and differences in interest rates between two countries, which reflects an economic equilibrium in the foreign exchange market under which arbitrage opportunities are eliminated. When in equilibrium, and when interest rates vary across two countries, the parity condition implies that the forward rate includes a premium or discount reflecting the interest rate differential. Forward exchange rates have important theoretical implications for forecasting future spot exchange rates. Financial economists have put forth a hypothesis that the forward rate accurately predicts the future <b>spot</b> <b>rate,</b> for which empirical evidence is mixed.|$|E

500|$|Construction {{began in}} 1878 and though {{completed}} by 1882 the fort was operational in 1880. Changes {{were made to}} the design during construction. Some forced by armament changes and others made to ensure additional security, including a rear-defence wall and connecting road from Military Road. By January 1880 two guns were in place and the fort opened later the same year with an extensive opening ceremony on 2 October. In addition to parades, a small target was moored [...] offshore and fired on by all guns. A total of sixteen shots were fired during which one of the teninch guns proved faulty. Only one ranging shot was fired and the shots were estimated to land from on-target to 350yards short. The fort's final cost was approximately £36,000 (A$7.05Converted to Australian Dollars at $1=£0.4112 from Australian Reserve Bank published <b>spot</b> <b>rate</b> for January 2005 million in 2005) consisting of £23,600 for physical structures and the remainder for armament and fittings.

He uses the parsimonious yield curve model of Nelson and Siegel (1987), {{for which he}} suggests a parameter restriction that avoids abrupt changes in parameter estimates and thus allows for the economic interpretation of the model to hold. The estimation of the model parameters is based on market prices of Czech government bonds. The Nelson-Siegel model is shown to fit the Czech bond price data well without being over-parameterized. Thus, the model provides an accurate and consistent picture of the Czech Treasury yield curve evolution.

500|$|The {{volunteer}} {{military force}} was revived in 1859, with new and modern arms for the infantry, cavalry and artillery. Though {{there was a}} few years of enthusiasm and a restructuring in 1866, by 1870 the force was virtually disbanded. In that year also, British troops were withdrawn from the other Australian colonies; none were by then stationed in South Australia. With no definitive defence policy, in 1864 the government had sought advice from Captain Parkin of HMS Falcon and Commodore Sir William Wiseman commander of the Australian station; both visiting British naval officers. They both recommended fixed fortifications for the coast supported by gunboats. Sir Wiseman's report particularly recommended construction of forts at Semaphore, Port Creek's entrance and one midway between. In 1864 a story circulated, supported by press speculation, that there was a danger of the Russian fleet attacking Melbourne should Russia and Britain find themselves at war. The South Australian Register produced an editorial decrying the states lack of defences. Within days £20,000 (A$4.14million in 2005)Converted to Australian Dollars at $1=£0.4112 from Australian Reserve Bank published <b>spot</b> <b>rate</b> for January 2005 was provided by the government for defence, an amount then seen as insufficient for significant preparation. The danger passed without any lasting defence action except the government's in-principle adoption of Sir Wiseman's recommendations. To curtail costs only the Semaphore fort was to be built initially, as it was considered the most critical. Site preparation begun and two [...] guns were purchased, but escalating cost estimates caused the plan to be abandoned by 1868.|$|E

40|$|The {{scope of}} this thesis {{is to examine the}} price {{discovery}} properties of clean tanker freight futures. This is conducted by testing the unbiasedness hypothesis, the lead-lag relationship between freight futures and <b>spot</b> <b>rates</b> and the forecasting properties of freight futures with regards to the underlying <b>spot</b> <b>rates.</b> The research focuses on the most liquid clean tanker freight futures, which are those written on the routes TC 2, TC 4 and TC 5. The results indicate that unbiasedness depends on the route in question and time to maturity. For a one-month horizon of TC 2 and one-, two- and three-month horizons of TC 5, the unbiasedness hypothesis is found to hold. Unbiasedness is also indicated for the two- and three-month horizons of TC 2, but due to weak evidence no conclusions are drawn. For TC 4 the unbiasedness hypothesis is rejected. The results from testing the lead-lag relationship indicate that futures prices lead <b>spot</b> <b>rates</b> for all the routes, but the relationship is found to be bi-directional for TC 4. When investigating the forecasting performance of end-of-month freight futures it is found that univariate models generally are outperformed by a random walk, indicating that forecasts should not be based on historic spot prices alone. The multivariate models confirm this finding as they generally produce more accurate forecasts than their univariate cousins. Multivariate time-series models were generally found able to outperform forecasts indicated by outright futures prices for one- and two-month horizons, but for a three-month horizon the futures performed as well as or better than the multivariate models. These results imply that the investigated freight futures contain valuable information about future <b>spot</b> <b>rates.</b> Problems regarding the stationarity of the series were experienced throughout the thesis. Because of this it is recommended that the tests performed in this thesis are repeated in a few years when more data is available...|$|R
