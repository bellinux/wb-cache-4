5|$|A {{number of}} {{approaches}} {{have been used}} to estimate the year of the crucifixion of Jesus. Most scholars agree that he died in 30 or 33 AD. The gospels <b>state</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> event occurred during the prefecture of Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea from 26 to 36 AD. The date for the conversion of Paul (estimated to be 33–36 AD) acts as an upper bound for the date of Crucifixion. The dates for Paul's conversion and ministry can be determined by analyzing the Pauline epistles and the Acts of the Apostles. Astronomers have tried to estimate the precise date of the Crucifixion by analyzing lunar motion and calculating historic dates of Passover, a festival based on the lunisolar Hebrew calendar. The most widely accepted dates derived from this method are April 7, 30 AD, and April 3, 33 AD (both Julian).|$|E

Although Mon Calamari cruisers are roughly {{the same size as}} most Imperial Destroyers, in head-to-head engagements the Mon Calamari cruisers are usually at a disadvantage, due to their thinner armor. Even so, Mon Calamari cruisers are still a formidable threat to the Imperial fleet; their large numbers of fighter squadrons, modular weapons systems and overlapping shields make them ideal for hit-and-run attacks on Imperial ships, bases, and military outposts.|$|E
