5|$|The {{long and}} short scales are two of several large-number naming systems for integer powers of ten that use the same words with {{different}} meanings. The long <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> based on powers of one million, whereas the short <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> based on powers of one thousand.|$|E
5|$|Countries {{where the}} long <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> {{currently}} used include most countries in continental Europe and most French-speaking, Spanish-speaking, and Portuguese-speaking countries, except Brazil.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the appearance and distribution of the rash, specific medical signs may be used by medical practitioners to assist with diagnosis. These may include Auspitz's sign (pinpoint bleeding when <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> removed), Koebner phenomenon (psoriatic skin lesions induced by trauma to the skin), and itching and pain localized to papules and plaques.|$|E
50|$|The {{scales of}} the rainbow fish were red, blue, green, and yellow. The green <b>scales</b> <b>were</b> made of grass, {{representing}} the element Earth. The blue <b>scales</b> <b>were</b> ice, which represented water: the second element. The yellow <b>scales</b> <b>were</b> lightning, representing air. The red <b>scales</b> <b>were</b> made of fire, representing the fourth element. The four elements that made up The Rainbow Fish's <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> also known as Prithvi, Jal, Vayu, and Agni.|$|R
500|$|The dorsal <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> {{generally}} small, acute, keeled, imbricate, and flattened, {{while the}} throat and pectoral (chest) <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> keeled. Granular (bumpy) <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> found {{on the top of}} the head and the [...] neck, while the scales on the middle of the neck are keeled, acute, flattened, and imbricate. In the middle of the back, there is some crowding and size reduction in the scales, and none of these <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> granular. On the dorsal side of the tail, the <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> acute, keeled, imbricate, and flattened. On the underside of the tail, the <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> smooth, rounded, and enlarged towards the centre of the tail (mid-ventrally). The ventral <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> rounded, smooth, cycloid (have a smooth outer edge), and imbricate. The scales on the ventral caudal (head) <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> smooth, cycloid, and enlarged mid-ventrally.|$|R
50|$|When the <b>scale</b> factor <b>is</b> {{larger than}} 1, (uniform or non-uniform) <b>scaling</b> <b>is</b> {{sometimes}} also called dilation or enlargement. When the <b>scale</b> factor <b>is</b> a positive number smaller than 1, <b>scaling</b> <b>is</b> sometimes also called contraction.|$|R
5|$|Midbody {{there are}} 29–41 rows of dorsal scales. These are {{strongly}} keeled {{except for the}} outermost rows. The ventral scale count is 123–147, the subcaudals 14–38. Females have no more than 24 subcaudals. The anal <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> single.|$|E
5|$|Niobium has {{no known}} {{biological}} role. While niobium dust is an eye and skin irritant {{and a potential}} fire hazard, elemental niobium on a larger <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> physiologically inert (and thus hypoallergenic) and harmless. It is frequently used in jewelry and has been tested for use in some medical implants.|$|E
5|$|Temperature is {{a measure}} of the kinetic energy of a sample of matter. Temperature is the unique {{physical}} property that determines the direction of heat flow between two objects placed in thermal contact. If no heat flow occurs, the two objects have the same temperature; otherwise heat flows from the hotter object to the colder object. Temperature, within meteorology, is measured with thermometers exposed to the air but sheltered from direct solar exposure. In most of the world, the degree Celsius <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> used for most temperature measuring purposes. However, the United States is the last major country in which the degree Fahrenheit temperature <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> used by most lay people, industry, popular meteorology, and government. Despite this, METAR reports from the United States also report the temperature (and dewpoint, see below) in degrees Celsius.|$|E

40|$|Vertical <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> {{intended}} to allow longitudinal interpretations of student change over time, but several deficiencies of vertical scales call their use into question. Deficiencies of vertical <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> discussed and growth scales, a criterion-referenced alternative, are described. Some considerations {{in developing and}} using growth <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> suggested...|$|R
50|$|In the {{following}} drawing {{all of the}} major/minor <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> drawn. Note that the constellation for all the major scales or all the minor <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> identical. The different <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> generated by rotating the note overlay. The notes {{that need to be}} sharpened/flattened can be easily identified.|$|R
5|$|The {{definition}} of sustained winds {{recommended by the}} World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and used by most weather agencies {{is that of a}} 10-minute average at a height of 10m (33ft). However, the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane <b>Scale</b> <b>is</b> based on wind speed measurements averaged over a 1-minute period, at 10m (33ft) above the surface. The scale used by RSMC New Delhi applies a 3-minute averaging period, and the Australian <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> based on both 3-second wind gusts and maximum sustained winds averaged over a 10-minute interval. These make direct comparisons between basins difficult.|$|E
5|$|The short <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> {{now used}} in most English-speaking and Arabic-speaking countries, in Brazil, {{in the former}} Soviet Union and several other countries.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} grading scales {{available}} for SAH. The Glasgow Coma <b>Scale</b> <b>is</b> ubiquitously used for assessing consciousness. Three specialized scores {{are used to}} evaluate SAH; in each, a higher number {{is associated with a}} worse outcome. These scales have been derived by retrospectively matching characteristics of people with their outcomes.|$|E

50|$|The 9-item Gynephilia <b>Scale</b> <b>was</b> {{created to}} measure erotic {{interest}} in physically mature females, and the 13-item Androphilia <b>Scale</b> <b>was</b> created to measure erotic interest in physically mature males. The <b>scales</b> <b>were</b> developed by Kurt Freund and Betty Steiner in 1982. They were later modified by Ray Blanchard in 1985, as the Modified Androphilia-Gynephilia Index (MAGI).|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} the ventral {{scales of}} the snake is an anal plate that protects the opening to the cloaca (a shared opening for waste and {{reproductive}} material to pass) on the underside near the tail. This anal scale may be single or divided into a pair. The part of the body beyond the anal <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> considered to be the tail.|$|E
5|$|Because at {{any given}} point on Earth {{the weight of a}}n object is {{proportional}} to its mass, the mass of an object in kilograms is usually measured by comparing its weight to the weight of a standard mass, whose mass is known in kilograms, using a device called a weighing scale. The ratio of the force of gravity on the two objects, measured by the <b>scale,</b> <b>is</b> equal to the ratio of their masses.|$|E
5|$|Category4, {{the second-highest}} {{classification}} on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane <b>Scale,</b> <b>is</b> used for tropical cyclones that have winds of 130–156mph (209–251km/h; 113–136kn). The {{division of the}} eastern and central Pacific basins occurs at 140°W; the eastern Pacific covers area east of 140°W, while the central Pacific extends between 140°W to 180°W. Both basins' division points are at 66°N as a northern point and the equator as the southern point. As of , 118hurricanes have attained Category 4 status in the northeastern Pacific basins. This list does not include storms that also attained Category5 status on the scale.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to adapt “Chemistry Perception Questionnaire (CPQ) ”, {{developed}} by Wells (2003), into Turkish and investigate validity and reliability of the Turkish version of the scale. The original version of the <b>scale</b> <b>was</b> composed of 35 items gathered under seven factors (aptitude, chemophobia, discipline, ethnicity, gender, instruction and value). First, permission from the developers of the <b>scale</b> <b>was</b> sought. Then, the items of the <b>scale</b> <b>were</b> translated into Turkish by researcher. The translation validity of the <b>scale</b> <b>was</b> examined by referring to the views of English and Turkish language experts. Once the final form of the <b>scale</b> had <b>been</b> derived, an English language expert translated the items of the scale from Turkish to English. The results obtained from this translation indicated that the Turkish version scale closely approximated to the original scale. Turkish version of the <b>scale</b> <b>was</b> administered to total of 435 university students from Education, Science and Engineering Faculties of Bartin, Kirikkale, Kilis 7 Aralik and Mustafa Kemal Universities. The item-total correlations were calculated and items which had negative or low correlation with the total <b>scale</b> score <b>were</b> excluded from the scale. The construct validity of the <b>scale</b> <b>was</b> examined by exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Varimax rotation technique was used due to the separation into irrelevant factors. Finally the <b>scale</b> <b>was</b> constructed from 20 items gathered under five factors (gender, value, chemophobia, discipline, aptitude). The reliability coefficient (Cronbach Alpha) for the whole <b>scale</b> <b>was</b> calculated as. 745...|$|R

5000|$|Test-Retest ReliabilityStability {{coefficients}} for the A-Trait <b>scale</b> <b>were</b> found to range from [...]73 to [...]86 across 3-15 week intervals, whereas the median stability coefficient for the A-State <b>scale</b> <b>was</b> [...]33 {{as would be expected}} for a situationally sensitive measure. Thus, two-week stability {{coefficients for}} the state anger <b>scale</b> <b>were</b> [...]27 (males) and [...]21 (females), while for the trait anger scale [...]70 (males) and [...]77 (females). Evidently, the STPI state <b>scales</b> appear to <b>be</b> sensitive to transitory fluctuations in emotional states, and as would be expected, the stability {{coefficients for the}} state <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> lower than those for the trait scales.|$|R
5|$|In major-thirds tuning, the {{chromatic}} <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> {{arranged on}} three consecutive strings in four consecutive frets. This four-fret arrangement facilitates the left-hand technique for classical (Spanish) guitar: For each hand position of four frets, the hand is stationary and the fingers move, each finger {{being responsible for}} one fret. Consequently, three hand-positions (covering frets 1–4, 5–8, and 9–12) partition the fingerboard of classical guitar, which has exactly 12 frets.|$|E
5|$|Kohlberg's <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> {{about how}} people justify {{behaviors}} and his stages are not a method of ranking how moral someone's behavior is. There should, however, be a correlation between how someone scores on the scale and how they behave, and the general hypothesis is that moral behaviour is more responsible, consistent and predictable from people at higher levels.|$|E
5|$|The broad head is {{distinct}} from the neck, and the snout is blunt in profile with {{the rim of the}} top of the head extending forwards slightly further than the mouth. Substantial cranial plates are present, although the parietal plates are often fragmented, especially towards the rear. A loreal <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> absent. Six to 9 supralabials and eight to 12 infralabials are seen. At midbody, there are 23–27 rows of dorsal scales. All dorsal scale rows have keels, although those on the lowermost scale rows are weak. In males/females, the ventral scales number 130-145/128-144 and the subcaudals 38-54/36-50. Many of the latter may be divided.|$|E
50|$|Uniform <b>scaling</b> <b>is</b> {{a linear}} {{transformation}} that enlarges or diminishes objects; the <b>scale</b> factor <b>is</b> {{the same in}} all directions; it is also called a homothety or dilation. The result of uniform <b>scaling</b> <b>is</b> similar (in the geometric sense) to the original.|$|R
50|$|Before the 1-5 <b>scale</b> <b>was</b> {{created in}} 1969 by the National Hurricane Center {{and later by}} the Bureau of Meteorology in Australia. Many {{tropical}} cyclones were simply ranked by the Beaufort Wind <b>Scale</b> which <b>was</b> created in the early 1800s by Francis Beaufort. The purpose of the <b>scale</b> <b>was</b> to standardize wind reports in ship logs. The <b>scale</b> <b>was</b> divided down into 14 forces (force 0 is calm while force 12 is hurricane).|$|R
50|$|The {{time between}} two <b>scales</b> <b>is</b> a centiday or 14.4 minutes (14 minutes 24 seconds). When the shi scales and centiday <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> {{marked on the}} ruler of the water clock, the shi <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> smaller, and be called as snicks. The time between the <b>scales</b> and snicks <b>is</b> the {{multiple}} of 2.4 minutes (2 minutes 24 seconds), which is the common factor time between centiday scale and shi scale.|$|R
5|$|The {{head has}} {{a less than}} {{triangular}} shape with a blunt and rounded snout. Still, the head is much wider than the neck. The rostral <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> small. The circumorbital ring consists of 10–16 scales. Across {{the top of the}} head, there are 7–11 interocular scales. 3–4 scales separate the suboculars and the supralabials. There are 12–17 supralabials and 13–17 sublabials. The first 3–4 sublabials contact the chin shields, of which there is only one pair. Often, there are two fangs on each maxilla and both can be functional.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} long <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> used by most Continental European {{countries and}} by most other countries whose languages derive from Continental Europe (with the notable exceptions of Albania, Greece, Romania, and Brazil). These countries use a word similar to billion to mean 1012. Some use a word similar to milliard to mean 109, while others use {{a word or}} phrase equivalent to thousand millions.|$|E
5|$|There {{are other}} scales {{that are not}} officially used {{by any of the}} Regional Specialized Meteorological Centres or the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centres. However they are used by other organizations, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. An example of such <b>scale</b> <b>is</b> the Integrated Kinetic Energy index, which {{measures}} the destructive potential of the storm surge; it works on a scale that ranges from one to six, with six having the highest destructive potential.|$|E
50|$|Related train <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> 1:42, 1:48 <b>scale</b> (American O scale), {{and also}} 1:45 scale (NEM European 0 <b>scale),</b> which <b>is</b> only {{slightly}} larger than 1:50 scale. Items in all these <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> similar enough in size that they are commonly used together in O layouts.|$|R
25|$|Their dorsal <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> heavily keeled, {{giving the}} snake a rough texture. The dorsal <b>scales</b> <b>are</b> {{arranged}} in 25 or 27 rows at midbody. There are usually 3 postoculars.|$|R
