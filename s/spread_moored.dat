40|$|Squalls {{are one of}} {{the main}} issues for the design of West Africa {{floating}} units mooring systems. At the present time and {{due to the lack of}} more relevant information and models, squalls are represented by on site time series of time varying wind speed and relative heading. The first FPSO units were designed on the basis of a reduced Squall database. Nowadays, the number of squall records has been significantly increased and a response based analysis can be carried out. The present paper is focused on the Gulf of Guinea environment. The area has been divided into two zones: North (Nigeria…) and South (Congo, Angola…). This approach enabled us to deal with 90 Squall events for North zone and 115 Squall events for South zone. Two different mooring systems, with quite different natural periods, have been investigated in order to cover the range of already installed <b>spread</b> <b>moored</b> FPSO’s. For every Squall of the database, time domain and modal simulations have been carried out in order to obtain the maximum values of the axial tension in mooring lines and of the offset of a standard <b>spread</b> <b>moored</b> unit. Then a statistical procedure is applied a) to estimate 100 -year return period values for these parameters and b) to assess overall trends besides the differences between results from both zones and both mooring systems. A comparative study has also been carried out to relate the 100 -year return period extrapolations with the values derived from classical design procedures in order to evaluate the potential design margins for extreme responses. Finally, areas needing further investigation are identified...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to optimise the performance of an initial Steel Lazy Wave Riser (SLWR) configuration {{with regards to the}} combined loading criteria in the Offshore Standard DNV-OS-F 201 : Dynamic Risers. This is done by conducting large scale parameter variations for the configuration using the programming interface in the OrcaFlex analysis software. The study considers the implementation of SLWRs in ultra-deep waters, in conjunction with a Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessel. Being connected to a <b>spread</b> <b>moored</b> FPSO in a water depth of 2800 meters, the riser configurations are analysed for typical extreme environmental conditions found in the Santos basin off the coast of Brazil. By analysing the vessel response for different 100 -year waves, the worst conditions are determined in terms of the largest downward velocities experienced at hang-off point. These parameters are used in combination with a 10 -year current to study the extreme response behaviour for the different configurations analysed. From the design basis, an initial SLWR configuration is established and it is verified that it meets the stated design criteria for combined loading and the wave induced fatigue. This configuration is then subjected to parameter variations by altering the hang-off angle, total net buoyancy force and length of buoyancy section. A total of 75 different configurations are created and analysed under extreme environmental conditions to determine a better configuration in terms of the combined loading utilisation. The findings are presented and a comparison of selected configurations are given to better understand the effect of the parameter variations. The optimisation results show that all the configurations meet the Ultimate Limit State (ULS) design criteria, and that the maximum utilisation experienced in the different cases varies significantly. With tension being the main contributor for the combined loading in these water depths, it is found that a combination of reduced hang-off angle and increased net buoyancy force will improve the performance of the configuration. From the optimisation study, the best configuration is determined and assessed for wave induced fatigue life. The fatigue results show an increase in fatigue life, which also reflects the importance of reducing the top tension. The work presented in this thesis provides information on how different parameters for a SLWR in ultra-deep water affects the combined loading utilisation, and it is proven that this concept is feasible for use in conjunction with a FPSO in these water depths...|$|E
40|$|With {{oil and gas}} {{reserves}} moving into deeper waters Floating Production Units (FPUs) {{have been widely used}} for production purpose. Selection of FPU for deepwater field development is a complicated task is mainly governed by factors like water depth, location of field (remoteness), environmental conditions, deck space requirements, storage requirements and offloading requirements etc. Amongst all the available FPU alternatives ship shaped FPSO has undoubtedly dominated the concept selection and are generally used in marginal and remote fields lacking pipeline infrastructure. Selecting riser concept for FPSO stationed in deepwater has posed challenges due high hydrostatic pressure and large vessel payload. The condition is worsened if besides deepwater, FPSO is also stationed in harsh environmental conditions. Under such conditions FPSO is subjected to large offsets and dynamics which are directly transferred along the riser length to its base unless riser is uncoupled from the FPSO. One of the major factors governing the riser concept selection for deepwater FPSO is the geographical location and weather conditions prevalent there. For example free hanging flexible riser has been mostly used in moderate environments of offshore Brazil while concepts like Steel Catenary Riser (SCR) and Hybrid Riser Tower (HRT) are dominant in calm weather conditions of West of Africa (WoA). Flexible risers in various configurations are currently the most widely used concept with turret moored FPSO in water depth up to 1500 m. This can be accounted to their flexibility which allows them to accommodate large vessel offsets and also to be spooled on reels/carrousels for storage and installation purposes. But other factors like requirement of large diameter to increase collapse resistance, tendency to birdcage, large cost and increased weight limits its use beyond 2000 m. For past decade on of the alternatives to flexible riser for <b>spread</b> <b>moored</b> FPSO in deepwater benign environments has been SCR. SCR is not only a cheaper option but also permits use of large diameter sizes as required to withstand high hydrostatic pressure at larger depths. However SCRs are yet to find its application with deepwater FPSO in moderate to harsh environments due to their reduced fatigue life at hang-off and Touch Down Zone (TDZ). One way of improving the fatigue life of SCR is by changing the riser configuration from catenary to wave shaped (SLWR) by adding buoyancy to it and such a configuration is installed with turret moored FPSO (1780 m) in offshore Brazil. Two overcome the disadvantage of coupled riser systems like SCR, un-coupled riser concepts namely Hybrid Riser Tower (HRT), Single Hybrid Riser (SHR) and Buoyancy Supported Riser (BSR) have been installed. Fairly new un-coupled riser concepts like Grouped Single Line Offset Riser (SLOR), Catenary Offset Buoyant Riser Assembly (COBRA) and Tethered Catenary Riser (TCR) are being studied and developed for deepwater application. Till date there is no FPSO stationed in water depths exceeding 1000 m in Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS). Case study is performed at the end of thesis with the aim of recommending suitable riser concept which can be hooked to internal turret moored FPSO stationed in 1500 m water depth and harsh environmental conditions of Northern Norwegian Sea. Based on the literature review lazy wave configuration of flexible riser and Steel Lazy Wave Riser (SLWR) have been considered as a viable riser concept. Main aim of this case study is to compare the two riser concepts on basis of vessel payload, fabrication cost and installation cost while the scope of study involves preforming static, dynamic and fatigue analysis of both the riser systems by using Orcaflex. At the end of thesis an effort has been made to come up with suitable conclusions and recommendations based on the work done in this thesis...|$|E

Limited time simulations are performed to verify the qualitative conclusions drawn on the nonlinear dynamics of SMS using catastrophe sets.

WECs can be considered an innovative solution able {{to contribute to the}} green energy supply and –at the same time– to protect the rear coastal area under marine spatial planning considerations. This research activity essentially rises due to this combined concept. The WEC under exam is a floating device belonging to the Wave Activated Bodies (WAB) class. Experimental data were performed at Aalborg University in different scales and layouts, and the performance of the models was analysed under a variety of irregular wave attacks. The numerical simulations performed with the codes MIKE 21 BW and ANSYS-AQWA. Experimental results were also used to calibrate the numerical parameters and/or to directly been compared to numerical results, in order to extend the experimental database. Results of the research activity are summarized in terms of device performance and guidelines for a future wave farm installation. The device length should be “tuned” based on the local climate conditions. The wave transmission behind the devices is pretty high, suggesting that the tested layout should be considered as a module of a wave farm installation. Indications on the minimum inter-distance among the devices are provided. Furthermore, a CALM mooring system leads to lower wave transmission and also larger power production than a <b>spread</b> <b>mooring.</b> The two numerical codes have different potentialities. The hydrodynamics around single and multiple devices is obtained with MIKE 21 BW, while wave loads and motions for a single moored device are derived from ANSYS-AQWA. Combining the experimental and numerical it is suggested –for both coastal protection and energy production– to adopt a staggered layout, which will maximise the devices density and minimize the marine space required for the installation. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{composed}} of theoretical, experimental, and numerical studies. In Part I, it discusses fundamental challenges of the discrete element method, provides a set of algorithms for addressing them, and presents performance gains of an improved algorithm on a target computer platform. A new contact detection and force resolution algorithm based upon (i) the fast common-plane (FCP) algorithm, (ii) using axisaligned bounding boxes (AABBs) to perform a proximity search, (iii) estimating the time of collision, and (iv) accurate resolution of contact points is presented. Benchmark simulations indicate {{an order of magnitude}} increase in performance is achievable for {{a relatively small number of}} elements. A new parallel discrete element algorithm is presented which combines the domain decomposition, object-oriented, and perfectly parallel strategies of parallelism to eliminate the drawbacks of parallel discrete element algorithms put forth by past studies. A significant speed-up is observed in comparison to past studies in trials conducted on a NUMA-based SMP computer. In Part II, various applications of the discrete element method are reviewed, with an emphasis on ice-structure interaction. The conical design of the Kulluk drillship is of particular interest due to its success in operating in the Beaufort Sea from 1975 - 1993 and its subsequent purchase and recommission by Shell in 2006. Three previous experimental studies and a unique set of full-scale data measurements form the basis for comparison of a concurrent experimental and numerical investigation. The results of a model scale experiment at the NRC-IOT are analyzed and presented, followed by results of the numerical simulations. A 1 : 40 scale replica of the Kulluk platform in level ice produces results which are consistent with past experiments and confirm expected trends as well as different regimes of results dependent on the ductile/brittle behavior of ice. The numerical setup models the full-scale platform in three dimensions with a 24 -sided rigid conical structure, ice as an elastic brittle material with plate-bending elements, and platform mooring through the implementation of a <b>spread</b> <b>mooring</b> algorithm. Numerical results are in agreement with past results for ice thickness of less than 1. 2 m, confirming that the initial design goal of the Kulluk was achieved while still overestimating the loads in comparison to the full-scale data set.

In ultra deepwater developments, the offshore {{industry has been}} challenged to solve demanding tasks, to develop new and reliable installation technologies for deepwater and uneven seafloor conditions, and to discover technology to deal with harsh environmental conditions. Pipeline installation in deeper water area needs special considerations regarding the lay vessel capabilities. These capabilities are that the vessel should have enough tension capacity for the deeper water and good dynamic positioning system restricted to small movements only. Two common methods used to install pipeline are the S-Lay and J-Lay methods. Some parameters {{need to be considered}} when choosing the appropriate installation method, therefore limitations for each methods are investigated. For the S-Lay method, these important parameters Include vessel tension capacity, stinger length, stinger curvature, strain in the overbend region and bending moment in the sagbend region. The maximum depth at which a given pipeline can be laid could be increased with a longer stinger of the lay barge and bigger vessel tension capacity. However, choosing these options may require clamping to pull the pipeline that can cause a heavy mooring system and high risk associated with a very long stinger subject to hydrodynamic forces. In addition, these options also could destroy the pipe coating. On the contrary with the S-Lay method, the J-Lay method reduces any horizontal reaction on the vessel’s equipment, and because of this, the J-Lay technology might be used to meet project requirements in deeper water. However, the capability of the J-Lay method in deep and very deep waters requires barges with dynamic positioning capabilities. This is because positioning by <b>spread</b> <b>mooring</b> with anchors would always be worthless and often unfeasible due to the safety of operations. Under extreme conditions, the loading process induced by the lay barge response to wave actions in deep waters is less severe for J-lay method compared to other methods. However, special attention has to be paid to the complex nature of vortex shedding induced oscillations along the suspended pipeline span. Considering the aspects mentioned above, studies will be carried out in this master thesis. The thesis will expose two pipeline installation methods, i. e.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest in using wind turbines oshore, and in deeper water. The tension leg platform wind turbine (TLPWT) concept is promising for intermediate (45 - 150 m) or deep (> 150 m) water. The limited platform motions are expected to reduce the structural loading on the tower and blades compared to other floating concepts, without requiring the large draft of a spar or the <b>spread</b> <b>mooring</b> system and complex construction of a semi-submersible. Although numerous TLPWT designs exist on paper, {{there is very little}} consensus regarding size, tendon design, and analysis requirements. In order {{to determine whether or not}} such concepts could be feasible and to lead the way for future optimization work, a better understanding of how design choices aect the global system performance, an investigation of potential design-driving load cases, and an evaluation of the simulation sensitivity are required. TLPWT systems are complex and dynamic: time-varying environmental loads from the sea, soil, and air act on a exible integrated structure with a wide range of natural frequencies. Furthermore, the wind turbine may enter and exit various operational, start-up, shut-down, and failure modes. Dynamic simulation of TLPWTs requires multidisciplinary consideration of aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, control systems, and structural mechanics. Frequency-domain methods from oshore structures are not well-suited to the exible structure and wind forces, while the computationally intense simulations common to the wind turbine industry are impractical with respect to the long time series required to capture wave- and low-frequency dynamics. A new computational tool (SIMO-RIFLEX-AeroDyn) was developed and used to examine both the design and analysis of TLPWTs. The combination of three well-known codes under a single structural solver gave a stable, state-of-the-art numerical tool for analysis of floating wind turbines. Additionally, the wind turbine control system was implemented in Java, including options for applying a control system fault at an arbitrary point in time. This framework enabled detailed studies of parametric design effects, comparisons of different hydrodynamic models using a single structural model - including the implementation of a different ringing force model - and simulation of off-design conditions. This thesis presents several baseline designs based on a parametric approach. Preliminary coupled simulations using first order wave forces suggested that a reasonable single column design with displacement between 3500 and 6500 m 3, three pontoons (for easier installation), and pontoon radius between 28 and 35 m, may be able to support a 5 MW wind turbine and withstand harsh environmental conditions. Having established these designs as test cases, various analysis methods were compared. Neither linear frequency-domain analysis nor Morison-type forces gave acceptable results. Second-order sum-frequency wave forces were found to be important for fatigue and extreme response calculations for certain TLPWTs, particularly those with relatively soft tendons. Third order ringing forces were found to be critical for TLPWTs with large diameters (14 - 18 m), especially when the turbine was idling or parked. Finally, the analysis tool was extended to several different severe operational conditions. Control system faults were found to cause large tower top loads and yaw motions for TLWPTs, while wind-wave misalignment resulted in generally smaller responses than aligned conditions. Second-order forces, however, had a greater impact in misaligned wind and waves than in aligned conditions. The original contributions of this thesis - including participation in developing the novel analysis tool (and the implementation of ringing loads), the development of a simplifed design method, and the presented simulation results - provide the background for further studies of TLPWTs and other floating wind turbine concepts.

Other than a brief period (10 days) in which the WEC was removed for repair, {{it was in the}} water from Feb. 15, 2011 until Mar. 21, 2012. The SeaRay, as this WEC is known, consists of three rigid bodies which are constrained to move in a total of eight degrees of freedom (DOF). The SeaRay is kept on station with a <b>spread,</b> three-point <b>mooring</b> system. This prototype WEC is heavily instrumented, including but not limited to torque transducers and encoders reporting generator torque applied to and relative pitch of the floats, an inertial measurement unit (IMU) reporting translational acceleration and rotational position of the spar/nacelle, a GPS sensor reporting position, load cells reporting mooring loads at the WEC connection points and a number of strain gauges embedded in the fiberglass reinforced plastic (FRP) hull. Additionally, wave and current data are collected using an Acoustic Wave And Current Profiler (AWAC), allowing performance and design data to be correlated to environmental input conditions. This data – quality controlled, processed and analyzed – is used to characterize the metocean conditions (i. e. sea states). The WEC response will be correlated to the metocean conditions. These results will primarily be used to validate numerical models. The validated numerical models will be used optimize the commercial scale WEC and inform the design process. This document details the SeaRay experiment, including the quality control, processing and subsequent analysis of the data. Furthermore, the methodology and the results of numerical model validation will be described...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{wind energy}} {{is one of}} the most promising, {{sustainable}} and clean energy solutions for the future. The wind industry in Europe experiences a very fast development these years, moving from onshore to offshore in shallow water and then in deep water. A floating wind turbine is an offshore wind turbine mounted on a floating structure that allows the turbine to generate electricity in water depths where bottom-fixed towers are not accessible. However, the offshore wind energy still has its shortcoming, i. e. the high cost. The most effective way to reduce the cost of energy is to use a larger wind turbine, which can absorb more wind power. So a new design of offshore wind turbine need to be considered. In this thesis, a new spar-buoy concept was developed based on the OC 3 -Hywind concept which developed by National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), to support the DTU 10 MW reference wind turbine. An initial design is performed by upscaling of an existing 5 MW spar platform design, then checked against buoyancy, stability, hydrodynamic and strength criteria. In addition, a <b>spread</b> catenary <b>mooring</b> system has been designed for the spar concept. Then the SIMO-RIFLEX-AeroDyn model is established include viscous drag elements. It is found that the blade pitch controller can excite large platform resonant motion at above rated wind speeds during turbulent wind test, which could be possibly reduced by changing the PI gains of the controller. Finally, time domain coupled dynamic analysis of the spar floating wind turbine is performed by using the SIMO-RIFLEX-AeroDyn code. Characteristic responses of the spar floating wind turbine are studied and compared to other two floating wind turbine concepts. It is found that spar has the largest surge oscillations among three concepts, yet the semi has largest pitch mean value and standard deviation than others. Due to the taut mooring system, all the motions for the TLP is much smaller as compared to the spar and the semi...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} coupled fluid-structure interaction (FSI) {{of a wave}} energy converter (WEC) and evaluates {{the design of a}} WEC mooring system. The research is conducted in support of conceptual development, field test and performance evaluation of WECs as part of the mission of the Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy Center at Oregon State University. The coupled FSI study focuses on the evaluation of predictive capabilities and computational performance of commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and potential flow codes using laboratory model test results. The evaluations of a WEC mooring system focus on analysis of field test data and evaluations of the anchor movability, fatigue design and extreme load of the Ocean Sentinel (OS) test platform mooring system deployed off the Oregon coast. Numerical data using a commercial mooring system simulation code are conducted to supplement time history data for the calculations of anchor pulling force, fatigue damage and extreme load. Specifically, this dissertation can be divided into three parts. In the first part the performances of a finite element explicit Navier-Stokes (NS) solver (LS-DYNA ALE), a finite element implicit NS solver (LS-DYNA ICFD), and a nonlinear potential flow solver (AQWA) in predicting highly nonlinear hydrodynamic responses of a floating point absorber (FPA) under large-amplitude waves are studied. The two NS solvers calculate the coupled FSI including fully nonlinear inviscid and viscous forces. The nonlinear potential flow solver calculates individual inviscid wave force components (a Froud-Krylov force, a radiation force, a diffraction force and a hydrostatic force) and empirical (Morison equation) viscous force. Comparing numerical results to laboratory experimental measurements, the two NS solvers and the nonlinear potential flow solver are found to be capable of providing accurate predictions of the nonlinear motion responses of the FPA. FSI coupling algorithms and computational costs of these three solvers are evaluated. Based on the results of the nonlinear potential flow solver at different wave periods, the individual wave force components and the viscous force are studied quantitatively. The nonlinearity of the restoring force and the Froude-Krylov force are found to be important for the FPA responses in all (heave, surge and pitch) directions; the nonlinearity of the viscous force is found to be important in only the heave and pitch directions. The second part first presents a catenary <b>spread</b> <b>mooring</b> system design of a mobile ocean test berth (MOTB), the Ocean Sentinel (OS) instrumentation buoy, which is developed by the Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy Center (NNMREC) to facilitate ocean test of wave energy converters (WECs). Then the OS mooring design, which is similar to a conventional WEC point absorber mooring system, is evaluated through both field test analysis and quasi-static analysis: the field test analysis is based on the extensive data of the OS positions, mooring tensions on the OS and environmental conditions of waves, wind and current, collected during the 2013 field test of the OS mooring system; the quasi-static analysis is based on the analytical catenary equations of mooring chains. Both global characteristics and survivability characteristics of the mooring system are evaluated: the global characteristics include the influence of the OS excursion to mooring tension, positional distribution of the OS, directional control of the OS and environmental contributions of waves, current and wind to mooring tensions; the survivability characteristics include the anchor movability and strength capacities of mooring. Because anchor movement occurred {{near the end of the}} field test, a systematic procedure of designing a mooring system with adequate anchor holding capacity is developed and applied to design a new OS mooring system. In the third part, first, the accuracies of a fully coupled method based numerical model in predicting the mooring tensions of the OS mooring system and the OS positions are validated by comparing the numerical results to the field data collected during the 2013 OS field test. Then, the anchor movability, fatigue damage and extreme mooring tension of the OS mooring system are investigated using the mooring tensions predicted by the numerical model. The results of the above studies are summarized as follows: (1) The numerical model provides accurate predictions of the mooring tensions and OS positions under harsh environmental conditions; (2) When the OS drifted significantly near the end of the field test, the bow, port and starboard anchors were likely not dragged, dragged significantly and dragged slightly, respectively; (3) The fatigue damages of mooring lines are predicted for environmental conditions from low to high sea states; and (4) The strengths of mooring lines in the original mooring design are adequate compared to the predicted extreme mooring tensions...|$|R

However, high cost is still the main challenge for the oshore wind industry. Floating oshore designs provides the possibility to carry large wind turbines {{to reduce the cost}} per MWh. In this thesis, a pontoon-type semi-submersible platform has been designed to support the DTU 10 MW reference wind turbine. The initial design is made though upscaling of an existing 5 MW semi-submersible platform design. The design is then checked against buoyancy, stability, hydrodynamic and strength criteria. In addition a <b>spread</b> catenary <b>mooring</b> system has been designed based on the catenary theory. Further tests show that clump weight might be needed to balance the strength and stiness of the mooring lines. Floating wind turbine models with dierent levels of complexity have been established and studied through the thesis. In addition, viscous drag force and second order wave force have been implemented. Finally the SIMO-RIFLEX-AeroDyn model is established, and extensive numerical tests have been performed to check the model. The modelling of blades, hub, nacelle and shaft {{has been found to be}} dicult and will result in some diculties in eigenfrequency prediction of the wind turbine. It is also found that the blade pitch controller can excite large platform pitch resonant motion at above rated wind speeds, which could be possibly solved by reducing the PI gains of the controller. Finally, time domain coupled dynamic analysis of the floating wind turbine system is performed by the SIMO-RIFLEX-AeroDyn code. Characteristic responses of the semi-submersible floating wind turbine are studied and compared to those of the land-based wind turbine. It is found that platform motions have limited influence on the aerodynamic performance of the wind turbine. Besides, operating at rated wind speed is found to produce the largest blade and tower bending moments for both land-based and floating wind turbines. For the floating wind turbine, resonant surge and pitch motions could be excited by turbulent wind under operational conditions which will dominate the response. Second order wave force has some influences on the surge and pitch resonant responses,but these influences are small comparing to those of turbulent wind. However, second order wave force could be important for the study of heave motion, which is wave force dominated even under turbulent wind conditions...|$|R
