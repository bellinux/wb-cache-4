The presence of microbial biofilms has been evidenced by electron microscopy techniques {{on the surface}} of all materials used in dentistry, but the best were found {{on the surface of}} dental alloys. Aims. The constitution of microbial strains collection isolated from dental plaque. We studied the development of monospecific biofilms on dental alloys, in order to establish the influence of the physical and chemical structure of the alloys with the dynamics of experimental biofilms. Material and methods. The analysis of bacterial diversity of dental plaque samples was realised with: optic microscope, scanning electronic microscope, determination of bacterial loading, identification of the most important bacterial species and genus after cultivating and isolation in anaerob and aerob media and also automatic identification with VITEK systems. Were tested the patogenity and the virulent status and also the resistance of the cells with no adherence and of the cells included in artificial developed biofilms on dental alloys. Selected materials were: noble alloys (gold-palladium and gold-platinum alloys); seminoble alloys (silver-palladium alloys) and <b>stainless</b> <b>alloys</b> (cobalt-chromium, nikel-chromium alloys). Results. Dental plaque has a great structural complexity (there are, in the same time: spiral bacterium, fungus, some gram positive morphological type). Tested strains have a high capacity of adherence on dental alloys above mentioned, even after 24 hours of incubation. The bacteria are more resistant in adhered state comparing with initial condition. Conclusions. Repartition of the selected monospecifc microbial biofilms on dental alloys is determined by antiseptic potential of the alloys components: the development on <b>stainless</b> <b>alloys</b> of much more thicker biofilms than seminoble and noble alloys.

40|$|Five alloys {{were tested}} in the {{presence}} of water vapor and water vapor with HCl for 1000 hours using simulated combustion gas. Samples were removed at intervals during each test and measured for determination of corrosion rates. One sample of each alloy was examined with a SEM after the completion of each test. Cumulative corrosion depths were similar for the superstainless alloys. Corrosion for Alloy TP 310 roughly doubled. Corrosion for the enhanced <b>stainless</b> <b>alloys</b> changed dramatically with the addition of chlorine. Corrosion for Alloy RA 85 H increased threefold, whereas Alloy TP 347 HFG showed an eightfold increase. SEM examination of the alloys revealed that water vapor alone allowed the formation of chromium oxide protective layers on the superstainless alloys. The enhanced <b>stainless</b> <b>alloys</b> underwent more corrosion due to greater attack of sulfur. Iron-rich oxide layers were more likely to form, which do not provide protection from further corrosion. The addition of chlorine further increased the corrosion because of its ability to diffuse through the oxide layers and react with iron. This resulted in a broken, discontinuous, and loose oxide layer that offered less protection. Niobium, although added to aid in creep strength, was found to be detrimental to corrosion resistance. The niobium tended to be concentrated in nodules and was easily attacked through sulfidation, providing conduits for further corrosion deep into the alloy. The alloys that displayed the best corrosion resistance were those which could produce chromium oxide protective layers. The predicted microstructure of all alloys except Alloy HR 3 C is the same and provided no further information relating to corrosion resistance. No correlation can be found relating corrosion resistance to the quantity of minor austenite-or ferrite-stabilizing elements. Also, there {{does not appear to be}} a correlation between corrosion resistance and the Cr:Ni ratio of the alloy. These alloys were tested for their corrosion resistance alone. Strength and creep tests were not performed. Based only their corrosion resistance, Alloys RA 310 and TP 310 were shown to be the best suited to resist chlorine in a combustion environment.

The significance of deformation nanostructure and stacking fault energy (SFE) changes in the material on IASCC susceptibility is also discussed. Results show that the IASCC susceptibility of the alloys increases with increasing irradiation dose and decreasing stacking fault energy. IASCC tends to initiate at locations where slip dislocation channels intersect grain boundaries.

40|$|Grain {{boundary}} radiation-induced segregation (RIS) in Fe-Ni-Cr <b>stainless</b> <b>alloys</b> {{has been}} measured and modelled {{as a function}} of irradiation temperature and dose. Heavy-ion irradiation was used to produce damage levels from 1 to 20 displacements per atom (dpa) at temperatures from 175 to 550 {degrees}C. Measured Fe, Ni, and Cr segregation increased sharply with irradiation dose (from 0 to 5 dpa) and temperature (from 175 to about 350 {degrees}C). However, grain boundary concentrations did not change significantly as dose or temperatures were further increased. Impurity segregation (Si and P) was also measured, but only Si enrichment appeared to be radiation-induced. Grain boundary Si levels peaked at an intermediate temperature of {approximately} 325 {degrees}C reaching levels of {approximately} 8 at. %.

Examination of reported RIS in neutron-irradiated stainless steels revealed similar effects of irradiation dose on grain boundary compositional changes for both major alloying and impurity element`s. The Inverse Kirkendall model accurately predicted major alloying element RIS in ion- and neutron-irradiated alloys over the wide range of temperature and dose conditions.

40|$|A {{number of}} passive film growth {{models have been}} {{advanced}} in the past, each founded on different assumptions and providing different rate laws. A new, generalized growth model has been developed and the numerical simulation of the transient behavior of oxide film growth on metals and alloys is reported here. This model {{is based on the}} transport of anions and cations (in a Cr 2 O 3 film for stainless alloy). In contrast to most models up to date, it describes the time-variant behavior of film and film/solution potential differences. Because these potential differences are expressed as exponential functions of film thickness, asymptotic behaviors can be studied and it is shown that a square root law results for very thin and very thick films. Growth rate for intermediate films and during transient periods, on the other hand, is determined by numerical integration. Parameters which were introduced by the model and whose values are unknown are conveniently regrouped into only four lumped parameters, which are easily estimated by numerical optimisation. It is shown that experimental oxide film thickness measurements on <b>stainless</b> <b>alloys</b> in high-temperature aqueous environments can be reproduced.

40|$|The {{excellent}} {{corrosion resistance}} of stainless steels {{arises from the}} presence of a passive film on its surface. Above 10. 5 wt% Cr a chromium oxide of 1 - 3 nm is formed {{on the surface of the}} metal that in case of damage will reform and hinder further dissolution of the metal. However, the passivity of the stainless steel can be altered by material factors and external factors; such as the composition of the underlying phases, external loads or thermal treatments. In this work the local electrochemical techniques Scanning Vibrating Electrode Technique (SVET) and Scanning Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (SKPFM) and the local characterization techniques X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) have been used to investigate corrosion phenomena of <b>stainless</b> <b>alloys</b> based on measurements of corrosion current density, work function, thickness and composition of the oxide. The effect on work function of the thickness of the passive film and composition of the underlying phases was investigated for 301 LN austenitic stainless steel (Paper I) and a heat treated superduplex 25 Cr 7 Ni type stainless steel (Paper II). It was shown that the work function can be an indicator of corrosion resistance of the phases in the microstructure, and that the composition of the underlying phases had a greater effect on the work function than the thickness of the passive film. External factors such mechanical deformation (Paper I) and welding (Paper III) altered the passivity of the steel and work function. It was found that plastic deformation decreased irreversibly the work function, whereas elastic deformation did not have any permanent effect. Thermal oxides affected the passivity of stainless steels welded joints and were detrimental for its corrosion resistance. Anodic activity, observed with SVET, and pitting corrosion were detected at the heat tint and attributed to the interaction between the composition and the thickness of the oxide.
