40|$|Background: To promote early {{rehabilitation}} of walking, gait training can start even when patients are on bed rest. Supine stepping {{in the early}} phase after injury is proposed to maximise the beneficial effects of gait restoration. In this training paradigm, mechanical loading on the {{sole of the foot}} is required to mimic the ground reaction forces that occur during overground walking. A pneumatic <b>shoe</b> <b>platform</b> was developed to produce adjustable forces on the heel and the forefoot with an adaptable timing. This study aimed to investigate the stimulation parameters of the <b>shoe</b> <b>platform</b> to generate walking-like loading on the foot sole, while avoiding strong reflexes. Methods: This study evaluated this platform in ten able-bodied subjects in a supine position. The platform firstly produced single-pulse stimulation on the heel or on the forefoot to determine suitable stimulation parameters, then it produced cyclic stimulation on the heel and the forefoot to simulate the ground reaction forces that occur at different walking speeds. The ankle angle and electromyography (EMG) in the tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus (SOL) muscles were recorded. User feedback was collected. Results: When the forefoot or/and the heel were stimulated, reflexes were observed in the lower leg muscles, and the amplitude increased with force. Single-pulse stimulation showed that a fast-rising force significantly increased the reflex amplitudes, with the possibility of inducing ankle perturbation. Therefore a slow-rising force pattern was adopted during cyclic stimulation for walking. The supine subjects perceived loading sensation on the foot sole which was felt to be similar to the ground reaction forces during upright walking. The EMG generally increased with force amplitude, but no reflex-induced ankle perturbations were observed. The mean change in the ankle joint induced by the stimulation was about 1 °. Conclusions: The rate of force increase should be carefully adjusted for simulation of walking-like loading on the foot sole. It is concluded that the dynamic <b>shoe</b> <b>platform</b> provides adjustable mechanical stimulation on the heel and the forefoot in a supine position and has technical potential for simulation of ground reaction forces that occur during walking...|$|E
40|$|Walking is a {{fundamental}} human activity [1]. Rehabilitation of walking {{is one of the}} essential goals for patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) or other neurological impairments [2, 3]. Early rehabilitation is desirable to maximise the beneficial effects, so training programmes should be initiated even when patients are still on bed rest. In order to promote early rehabilitation of patients with incomplete spinal cord injury who cannot maintain an upright posture, a Gait Orthosis for Early Rehabilitation (GOER) of walking was designed [2] and evaluated in this PhD work. This research started with a gait analysis experiment, through which the kinematics and kinetics of overground walking were investigated. Based on experimental walking data from able-bodied subjects, a least squares algorithm was developed to approximate the foot trajectories with circles. The determination of the best-fit circle for the toe trajectory over the whole gait cycle provided the basis for inducing toe movement by a rigid bar. Therefore a model of a two-bar mechanism was developed in Matlab/SimMechanics to simulate supine stepping. The simulated kinematics, including the angles of the hip, knee and ankle joints, showed comparable ranges of motion (ROMs) to the experimental walking performance in able-bodied subjects. This two-bar model provided the basis {{for the development of the}} GOER system. The intersegmental kinetics of the lower limb motion during supine stepping were investigated through computer simulation. A model of a leg linkage was firstly developed to simulate upright walking. After the model was validated by successful simulation of dynamic performance similar to experimental overground walking, the model was rotated by 90 o to simulate stepping movement in a supine posture. It was found that the dynamics of the hip joint were significantly influenced by the position change from upright to supine, which highlighted the importance of a leg-weight support during supine stepping. In contrast, the kinetics of the ankle joint were much influenced by the forces applied on the foot sole which mimicked the ground reaction occurring during overground walking. Therefore a suitable force pattern was required on the foot sole in order to train the ankle joint during supine stepping. The simulated kinematic and kinetic results provided the basis for the design process of the GOER system. A GOER prototype with mechanisms for one leg was manufactured, which included a bar linkage to move the leg frame upwards and downwards and a cam-roller mechanism to rotate the <b>shoe</b> <b>platform.</b> The bar-cam GOER prototype achieved coordinated movements in the leg frame through constant rotation of an electric motor. Preliminary tests were carried out in three able-bodied subjects who followed the movements produced by the GOER prototype. The subjects felt walking-like stepping movement in the lower limb. Synchronised motion in the hip, knee and ankle joints was obtained, with the ROMs in the physiological ranges of motion during overground walking. The experimentally obtained joint profiles during supine stepping matched the simulated supine stepping and were close to the profiles during overground walking. Apart from inducing proprioceptive feedback from the lower limb joints, the GOER system required dynamic stimulation from the <b>shoe</b> <b>platform</b> to mimic load occurring during the stance phase of overground walking. Activated by pneumatic components, the <b>shoe</b> <b>platform</b> managed to apply forces on the foot sole with adjustable amplitudes. The pneumatic <b>shoe</b> <b>platform</b> was evaluated in ten able-bodied subjects and managed to induce walking-like pressure sensation on the foot sole with physiological responses from the leg muscles. In summary, this thesis developed and evaluated a new gait training robotic system targeting supine stepping for patients who are still restricted to a lying position. The conceptual design process was developed through computer modelling and it was implemented as a prototype. Evaluation tests on able-bodied subjects proved the technical feasibility of the robotic system for supine stepping and led to recommendations for further development...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} promote gait {{restoration}} in patients who cannot maintain an upright position in the early post-injury phase, a Gait Orthosis for Early Rehabilitation was proposed for supine stepping. Although supine stepping can generate lower-limb joint trajectories which are close to normal gait, the inter-segmental dynamics of supine stepping {{are believed to be}} different from those of upright walking. Furthermore, training in a supine position requires a certain loading on the foot to mimic the ground reaction forces, where different loading amplitudes influence the joint dynamics. This work analysed the kinetics of supine stepping with variable loading and investigated structural modifications for the Gait Orthosis for Early Rehabilitation system to address this kinetic difference. Three able-bodied subjects walked overground while their walking performance was recorded. Based on the experimental data, a leg-linkage model was developed to simulate the dynamics of upright walking. This model was then rotated by 90 ° with different foot loadings to investigate the kinetics of supine stepping. Compared to upright walking, supine stepping had a large kinetic difference at the hip joint due to the supine leg position. The ankle joint during supine stepping was sensitive to the force amplitude simulated on the foot. Thus, the Gait Orthosis for Early Rehabilitation system requires a leg frame to compensate the position change and a <b>shoe</b> <b>platform</b> to activate the leg muscles, especially at the ankle joint. This study provided important structural information for the further development of the Gait Orthosis for Early Rehabilitation system...|$|E

40|$|Finally, the {{research}} of classifying and identifying individuals through their walking patterns is introduced. Alive biometrical features in dynamic human gait are adopted in the intelligent shoe system. Since gait data are dynamic, non-linear, stochastic, time-varying, noisy and multi-channel, we must select a modeling framework capable of dealing with these expected complexities in the data. Using the proposed machine learning methods, support vector machine (SVM) and hidden Markov models (HMMs), we build up probabilistic models that take the information of human walking patterns into account, and compare the overall similarity among human walking patterns of several wearers. In this thesis, we will build intelligent shoes under the framework for capturing and analyzing dynamic human gait. Existing MEMS technology {{makes it possible to}} integrate all the sensors and circuits inside a small module. In designing our intelligent shoe system, we require the following key characteristics in our system: (1) It should be convenient to wear and socially acceptable. Thus, the sensors and electronic hardware installed should not substantially change the weight and weight balance of a typical shoe, lest it alters how an individual normally walks. (2) We want to analyze a user's motion in real-time through a wireless interface to a remote laptop or other computer; we will also incorporate on-shoe data logging hardware for off-line analysis. (3) Sensors that monitor gait motion conditions may need to be attached to the insoles, in closer proximity to the foot of users. In order to investigate the problem of capturing power parasitically from normal human-body-motion for use in personal electronics applications, we also plan to develop an electromechanical generator embedded within the shoe for parasitic power collection from heel strike. Next, we can encode specific motions to control external devices through a wireless interface. This same system architecture that allows us to classify broad categories of motion also allows the intelligent shoe to act as a programmable, low-data rate control interface. We apply the system to several successful tasks based on this platform, especially the Shoe-Mouse. By using this interface, we can operate a device with our feet. Then, we present potential use of machine learning techniques, in particular support vector machine (SVM), and the intelligent <b>shoe</b> <b>platform</b> to detect discrete stages in the cyclic motion of dynamic human gait, and construct an identifier of five discrete events that occur in a cyclic process for precise control of functional electrical stimulation (FES). With the information of when the legs are in each phase of a gait, the timing of specific gait phase can be assessed. Huang, Bufu. "September 2007. "Adviser: Yangsheng Xu.

50|$|<b>Platform</b> <b>shoes</b> are shoes, boots, or sandals with {{an obvious}} thick sole, {{usually in the}} range of 3 - 10 cm. <b>Platform</b> <b>shoes</b> may also be high heels, in which case the heel is raised {{significantly}} higher than the ball of the foot. Extreme heights, of both the sole and heel, can be found in fetish footwear such as ballet boots, where the sole may be up to 20 cm high, and the heels up to 40 cm and more. The sole of a <b>platform</b> <b>shoe</b> can have a continuous uniform thickness, have a wedge, a separate block or a stiletto heel. Apart from the extreme forms of fetish shoes (which are first and foremost not intended for walking in), walking in <b>platform</b> <b>shoes</b> can be cumbersome and clumsy.
