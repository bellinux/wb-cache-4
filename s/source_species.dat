40|$|Fecal-borne {{microorganisms}} impact many shellfish-growing {{waters in}} coastal New Hampshire. Watersheds are often subject to fecal contamination {{by a variety}} of sources and efforts to improve water quality are often limited because of lack of information on which contaminant sources are most significant. Ribotyping and other microbial source tracking methods are useful new tools for providing information on the sources of fecal-borne bacterial contaminants in surface waters. New Hampshire has areas of abundant oyster (Crassostrea virginica) and clam (Mya arenaria) resources, the latter being most important in Hampton Harbor. In this study, Escherichia coli isolates (bacteria colonies) were obtained from water samples collected from ten sites in Hampton Harbor year-round during both dry and wet conditions. A library of known E. coli isolates was created from twenty different potential <b>source</b> <b>species</b> in the New Hampshire coastal watershed, including humans, livestock, pets, wildlife and avian species. The ribosomal RNA DNA of E. coli isolates was analyzed using ribotyping in which the patterns of ribosomal DNA were detected using chemiluminescence, then optimized and analyzed using GelCompar II software. A total of 249 isolates from the twenty known <b>source</b> <b>species</b> were used as a reference to identify sources for 390 unknown isolates from water samples taken from August 2000 through October 2001.

40|$|Abstract Background Microsatellite loci {{are widely}} used in {{population}} and conservation genetic studies of amphibians, but the availability of such markers for tropical and subtropical taxa is currently very limited. In order to develop resources for conservation genetic studies in the genus Indirana, we tested amplification success and polymorphism in 62 previously developed microsatellite loci, in eight Indirana species - including new candidate species. Developing genomic resources for this amphibian taxon is particularly important as it is endemic to the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot, and harbours several endangered species. Findings The cross-species amplification success rate varied from 11. 3 [*]% to 29. 0 [*]% depending on the species, with 29 - 80 [*]% of the amplifying loci being polymorphic. A strong negative correlation between cross-species amplification success (and polymorphism) and genetic distance separating target from <b>source</b> <b>species</b> was observed. Conclusions Our results provide additional genetic support {{for the existence of}} genetically divergent cryptic species within the genus Indirana. The tested markers should be useful for population and conservation genetic studies in this genus, and in particular, for species closely related to the <b>source</b> <b>species,</b> I. beddomii. </p...|$|E

40|$|Microsatellite cross-species {{amplification}} in {{the genus}} Centaurea (Compositae). - Microsatellites {{are widely used}} for population genetic studies although {{the development of these}} species-specific markers is costly and time-consuming. one strategy for saving time and money is the use of markers developed for one species (<b>source</b> <b>species)</b> in a different species (target species). this is known as cross-amplification. In the present work, two sets of microsatellites are used to test their transferability to six narrow endemic Centaurea species: i) 16 nuclear loci previously published for three congeneric species and ii) 10 universal chloroplast markers designed from Nicotiana tabacum sequences. Seventeen of the 26 markers tested were transferable and 14 of them were also polymorphic and therefore useful for future works. Nuclear markers were more variable and thus more informative than chloroplast markers. Interspecific amplification performed better for the nuclear loci developed for different Centaurea species than for the universal chloroplast markers developed for Nicotiana tabacum. Likewise, transferability was more successful for the species from sect. Phalolepis than for sect. Lepteranthus. therefore, our results support the idea that the success of the cross-amplification is influenced by the evolutionary distance between the target and the <b>source</b> <b>species.</b> Key words: chloroplast microsatellites; conservation; cross-amplification; interspecific amplification; narrow endemics; SSR; transferability; universal markers.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of DNA using molecular techniques {{is an important}} tool for studies of evolutionary relationships, population genetics and genome organisation. The use of microsatellite genetic markers in marsupial studies is primarily limited by their availability {{and the success of}} amplification. Within this study, 29 macropodoid (kangaroos, wallabies and rat kangaroos) microsatellite loci were characterised in the tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii) to evaluate the level of polymorphism and effects of cross-species amplification. Results indicated that 25 primer pairs amplified a single locus, with 21 exhibiting high levels of variability. The success of cross-species amplification was inversely proportional to the evolutionary distance between species. Therefore most macropodoid species can be studied using many of the available microsatellites, since <b>source</b> <b>species</b> are regularly distributed among macropodoid lineages. It was shown that M. eugenii had significantly (P < 0. 01) reduced genetic diversity compared with <b>source</b> <b>species.</b> In addition, many microsatellite loci had reduced repeat arrays within M. eugenii, and all monomorphic loci sequenced had interruptions within the repeat arrays. The diversity differences are most likely caused by ascertainment bias in microsatellite selection for both length and purity.
