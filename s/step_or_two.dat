25|$|With {{the speedy}} Mays on second, any base {{hit by the}} next batter, Willie McCovey, would likely win the series for the Giants. McCovey hit a {{screaming}} line drive right at second baseman Bobby Richardson, who snared it after a <b>step</b> <b>or</b> <b>two,</b> bringing the Series to a sudden end. Earlier in the inning, a failed sacrifice bunt by Felipe Alou with nobody out had ultimately kept his brother Matty, who couldn't advance to second, from scoring on Mays' two-out double. Finally, Richardson was not originally positioned to catch the drive until he moved three steps to his left in reaction to a McCovey's foul smash on the preceding pitch.|$|E
25|$|The large {{sub-floor}} {{is divided}} into four main rooms, accessed mainly off the rear promenade. Each of these spaces has a ripple iron ceiling which follows {{the slope of the}} seating tiers above, a concrete floor a <b>step</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> below street level and windows and doors opening both to the promenade and {{to the front of the}} stand overlooking the arena. The northern room is utilised by the St John's Ambulance Service and has been divided by sheeted partitions into cubicles. Facilities include an early iron-framed, wheeled ambulance stretcher. The southern room has been converted into an English-style pub, complete with appropriately decorated entry. There are toilets located at each end of the subfloor, accessed from the front – the men's toilet at the southern end and the women's at the northern end. The men's toilet retains an early lead-light fanlight above the entrance door, but both facilities have been remodelled internally.|$|E
500|$|Both Willie Pless and Alondra Johnson, {{two of the}} BC Lions' {{starting}} linebackers in 1990, did {{not return}} to the team in 1991. The BC Lions signed Allen in May 1991 to compete for one of these spots. Despite suffering a bruised knee during the preseason, Allen succeeded in making the active roster. He struggled in July and August, with Lions head coach Bob O'Billovich saying [...] "he's been a <b>step</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> away all the time on pass coverage". In late August, the Lions moved Allen to the practice squad and replaced him with new signing Bruce Holmes, who had led the CFL in tackles the previous season with the Ottawa Rough Riders. Allen finished his rookie season with 31 tackles, two sacks, and a fumble recovery over six games played.|$|E

500|$|Wyatt Earp drew {{a sketch}} in 1924 and another with John Flood on September 15, 1926 that {{depicted}} Billy Clanton {{near the middle}} of the lot, close to the Harwood house. Tom and Frank McLaury stood deeper in the lot. Frank was in the center between the two buildings, holding the reins of his horse. Tom was closer to C. S. Fly's boarding house. According to Wyatt's sketches, Morgan was on the right of the lawmen, close to the Harwood house, opposite Billy Clanton near the Harwood house and close to Fremont St. Virgil was deeper in the lot, opposite Frank and Ike Clanton. Wyatt was to Virgil's left, opposite Tom. [...] Doc Holliday hung back a <b>step</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> on Fremont Street. [...] Neither of Wyatt's sketches included Ike Clanton or Billy Clairborne, who ran from the fight.|$|E
500|$|Critics saw an [...] "undeniably" [...] Hindu {{connection}} between the film's story and the Vedic teaching of reverence for the whole universe, {{as well as the}} yogic practice of inhabiting a distant body by one’s consciousness and compared the film's love scene to tantric practices. [...] Another linked the Na'vi earth goddess Eywa to the concept of Brahman as the ground of being described in Vedanta and Upanishads and likened the Na'vi ability to connect to Eywa with the realization of Atman. [...] One commentator noted the parallel between the Na'vi greeting [...] "I see you" [...] and the ancient Hindu greeting [...] "Namaste", which signifies perceiving and adoring the divinity within others. [...] Others commented on Avatars adaptation of the Hindu teaching of reincarnation,—a concept, which another author felt was more accurately applicable to ordinary human beings that are [...] "a <b>step</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> away from exotic animals" [...] than to deities.|$|E
500|$|Referring to {{the scene}} in which Ben {{seemingly}} fits Sawyer with a lethal pacemaker, Michael Emerson comments Sadistic may be the word, but he doesn't seem to take much relish in it. He's just sort of detached, he looks at it coldly. I sometimes feel like everything to him {{is a sort of}} scientific experiment and he is interested in a dispassionate way in how the experiment runs its course. I think some day if we ever find out what his parentage is, that his parents were people of science. He also described the events as a demonstration that [...] "Ben has more cards than you think; ... he's a <b>step</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> ahead, one layer or two deeper than anyone else who is playing the game". The rabbit was a reference to Stephen King's , where King uses a rabbit in a cage with the number8 written on its back as an example for the connection between reader and writer. Emerson said that part of the appeal of the scene was that [...] "bunnies look so innocent, and the audience feels so tenderly about them you can feel nothing but beastly being mean to them". But Emerson added the rabbit in the scene had problems reacting to his attempts to scare him [...] "it was unfazed, it barely blinked".|$|E

Charlie McCollum of the San Jose Mercury News called them [...] "surprisingly unconvincing, a <b>step</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> above the effects in those deliberately cheese ball sci-fi flicks the Syfy channel shows on Saturday night." [...] Michael O’Sullivan of The Washington Post called the production design [...] "blandly generic" [...] and the special effects, props and costumes [...] "cheap and slapdash-looking". However, Austin Kennedy of Film Geek Central said the special effects were [...] "top-notch", John Depko and Susanne Perez of Daily Pilot called them [...] "impressive", Nathan Duke of Patch Media said they were [...] "impressive enough", and Peter Feldman of The Citizen described them as [...] "solid".|$|E

2500|$|In the {{build-up}} to No Way Out, McMahon had re-signed the New World Order (nWo), {{who started}} a feud {{with him after}} (kayfabe) Austin refused a beer gift following them costing him his match against Jericho. Problems in the backstage creativity were however then seemingly beginning to surface. Austin was reported as being unhappy regarding Hulk Hogan's return to the WWF, and was reported as refusing to lose to Hogan in a proposed match at WrestleMania X8, while Hogan reportedly told McMahon the same regarding losing to Austin. In recent years, Austin has {{this to say about}} why the match never took place: [...] "I guarantee you, if my head had been at a little different place, then by all rights, a [...] should have happened", Austin told JR. [...] "Physically and mentally where I was at, I could go. I think Hogan probably would have been a <b>step</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> behind that. That wasn't acceptable to me, and I didn't want to slow myself down. I say that {{with all due respect to}} Hulk Hogan, because he had a hellacious run. That was my thought process back in the day. I didn't think we could deliver". Consequently, the match was re-billed as The Rock defeating Hogan, whilst Austin defeated Scott Hall, climaxing his feud with the nWo.|$|E
2500|$|... "I am Going to the Lordy" [...] is a {{featured}} {{part of the}} Stephen Sondheim musical Assassins. In {{the song}} [...] "The Ballad of Guiteau", Guiteau sings an exaggerated version of the poem more and more fervently while the Balladeer sings about Guiteau's life, trial, and execution. Sondheim {{has said that the}} use of the poem in the song was one of two times he had ever borrowed from another writer in his work, the other being the time he used lines from William Shakespeare in the song [...] "Fear No More" [...] from The Frogs. Sondheim first learned of the poem from the short story by Charles Gilbert on which Assassins is based. He was going to include pieces of letters and diaries written by Guiteau as well, but felt that those would [...] "weigh the piece down." [...] The contrast of the [...] "fervent yet hymn-like poem" [...] and the styles of music in the song continue to suggest the insanity of Guiteau, a trait exemplified frequently in the musical. After Guiteau sings his poem unaccompanied and quietly, the Balladeer sings a verse, which is followed by Guiteau cakewalking up and down the scaffold and singing about looking on the bright side. He stops a <b>step</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> higher and begins singing the hymn again. After the third verse, Guiteau begins cakewalking when he reaches the noose and stops suddenly. He then begins singing his poem again, although this time much more forcefully and resolutely before the Balladeer interrupts and leads Guiteau to his death. Jim Lovensheimer implies that the use of the cakewalk interjected in the ballad show Guiteau looking for a prize, as the best cakewalker on a plantation would be awarded a prize. The lyrics of [...] "The Ballad of Guiteau", including the parts taken from [...] "I am Going to the Lordy", help to show Guiteau as a devoted but misguided Christian who [...] "lost a grip on reality." [...] Howard Kissel said that [...] "The Ballad of Guiteau" [...] was one of the oddest songs of Assassins due {{to the use of the}} poem.|$|E
