5|$|Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando was {{released}} roughly {{a year after}} the original game and received critical acclaim, to the point of frequently being viewed {{as one of the best}} PlayStation 2 games ever made. Most critics felt that the game was <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>predecessor,</b> and praised the game's graphics, gameplay, story, characterization and sound, but criticized its unforgiving difficulty and minigames.|$|E
5|$|Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics {{and was considered}} to be <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>predecessor.</b> Much of the praise went to the game's graphics, control and music, with major criticisms varying between the trial-and-error gameplay, lack of level variety, easy boss levels and lack of innovation. The game went on {{to become one of the}} best-selling PlayStation video games of all time and replaced its predecessor as the highest-selling Western title in Japan at the time, selling more than 800,000 units in the country by April 1998. A remastered version was included in the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy collection, released on the PlayStation 4 in June 2017.|$|E
25|$|The Mirage F1 was {{of similar}} size to the delta-winged Mirage III and Mirage 5, and was {{powered by the}} same SNECMA Atar engine as had been used on the larger Dassault Mirage IV; however, unlike its predecessors, it shared the layout of a swept wing mounted high on the {{fuselage}} and a conventional tail surface as used by the F2. Although it has a smaller wingspan than the Mirage III, the Mirage F1 nevertheless proved to be <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>predecessor,</b> carrying more fuel while possessing a shorter take-off run and superior maneuverability.|$|E

The FMX6 design wise was far <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>predecessors,</b> having {{switched}} <b>to</b> 10 inch rims and successfully successfully implemented a self-designed, Aluminum Honeycomb Impact Attenuator and dry sump lubrication system.|$|R
2500|$|The Guardian {{gave the}} game a perfect score, stating [...] "Criterion {{has done it}} again, setting a new {{standard}} for arcade-style racing games which won't be surpassed until {{the next generation of}} consoles has been on sale for a while. It actually leaves one feeling a bit sorry for Forza Horizon, which is a very good game, and infinitely <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>predecessors.</b> But Need For Speed: Most Wanted is, by whatever criteria you may see fit to apply, a great game." ...|$|R

Ruhlmann found this album <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>predecessor,</b> stating that Reynolds [...] "seems to have shaped the song selections to the singer's talents and given her the opportunity to sing in a more individual manner." [...] A review of the album in Billboard was also positive, noting the [...] "more focused direction and a simpler, purer sound".|$|E
500|$|In 1999, {{after the}} success of the first MediEvil, Sony {{requested}} that SCE Cambridge develop a sequel that would be released {{before the end of the}} PlayStation's lifespan. Chris Sorrell, who previously served as director of the first game, was not involved in development thus the project was handed over to James Shepherd. SCE Cambridge decided it would not be difficult to make a sequel to the first MediEvil, considering that the ending of its predecessor would give the team an opportunity to set the next game in a different time period. Shepherd settled on MediEvil 2 being set in the Victorian era, the centrepiece of the Neo-Gothic revival. Shepherd considered the hardest part of the development was deciding how to make the game <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>predecessor</b> through making certain aspects of the game humorous. To achieve this end, the studio recoded various core technology, which Shepherd considered was arguably similar to [...] "starting from scratch". By the time the game reached beta status the game offered larger levels, improved non-player character (NPC) logic, and more fighting abilities for the player-character.|$|E
50|$|The E61 bomblet was a 1/2 lb anti-personnel bomb {{designed}} to be carried in the E133 cluster bomb. The cluster bomb was {{designed to}} hold about 540 of the E61 anthrax bomblets. The E61 held about 35 mL of agent {{and a variety of}} pathogens could be used, generally anthrax spores. The E61 was perceived as <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>predecessors,</b> the M33 cluster bomb and its payload of M114 bombs. In fact, four of the smaller E61 bomblets produced twice the coverage area of the larger M114 bomb. Upon impact the E61 would detonate releasing an aerosol of its anthrax spore laden slurry into the air of its target area.|$|R

They concluded that Ironsword was [...] "one of the most welcome Nintendo Entertainment System games in a long time". The game {{was also one of the}} featured games in the November–December1989 issue of Nintendo Power, where it received six pages of coverage and featured a poster of the game. Game Players magazine awarded Ironsword the [...] "Game Players NES Excellence Award" [...] as one of the best games for the console in 1990.|$|E

500|$|While some reviewers {{considered}} Neverwinter Nights 2 <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>predecessor,</b> Neverwinter Nights, {{the sequel}} received lower overall review ratings. Implementation of the Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 ruleset was praised as {{faithful to the}} pen-and-paper version, with GameDaily stating [...] "The 3.5 edition ruleset {{is in full swing}} in Neverwinter Nights 2, where critical hits can devastate your entire party." [...] The game's representation of the Forgotten Realms campaign setting was also well received. The storyline was widely considered one of the game's strong points and an improvement over Neverwinter Nights. GameSpy stated that the single–player campaign was [...] "worthy of its exhaustive pedigree", and Game Informers reviewer said [...] "This title easily trumps the original NWN’s campaign with a vastly superior story and characters". Another reviewer declared it [...] "one of the best written games in history". [...] Aaron R. Conklin of The Wisconsin State Journal said, [...] "It'd be very easy to be turned off by the first mundane chapters of the game's sprawling plot.... Stick with it: Once your party hits Neverwinter (and reaches level seven or so), the proceedings become significantly more interesting—especially in terms of character interaction and development.... NWN2 is a masterpiece of storytelling and scope." [...] Conklin and Matt Slagle of Deseret News were pleased with the ethical choices in the game, with both noting approvingly that diplomacy was a very valid option that could succeed in place of combat.|$|E
40|$|Bootstrap-basedmodel {{selection}} {{has been}} shown inmany practical instances <b>to</b> be <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> classical methods such the AIC and MDL. This is particularly noticeable when the distribution of modelling noise is unknown and/or when the available data samples are small. One of the main problems of using bootstrap model selection with real data is the necessity of tuning the residual scaling parameter or estimating {{the length of a}} sub-sample. Recently, we have developed a new hook and loop (HL) resampling plane, in which the scaling of the residuals is avoided. Here, we compare the performance of the range of resampling planes {{that can be used in}} the context of model selection and show that the HL-based model selection is <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>predecessors.</b> Moreover, in the context of fitting parametric models to corneal data measured by videokeratoscopes, the HL provides results that are consistent with clinical expectations...|$|R

Mill later moved back to Thornton's position of seeing inflation and gold flight as sometimes being caused by trade imbalances.|$|R
2500|$|Coppola shot The Godfather Part II {{parallel}} to The Conversation {{and it was}} the last major American motion picture to be filmed in Technicolor. George Lucas commented on the film after its five-hour-long preview, telling Coppola: [...] "You have two films. Take one away, it doesn't work", referring to the movie's portrayal of two parallel storylines; one of a young Vito Corleone and the other of his son Michael. In the director's commentary on the DVD edition of the film (released in 2002), Coppola states that this film was the first major motion picture to use [...] "Part II" [...] in its title. Paramount was initially opposed to his decision to name the movie The Godfather Part II. According to Coppola, the studio's objection stemmed from the belief that audiences would be reluctant to see a film with such a title, as the audience would supposedly believe that, having already seen The Godfather, there was little reason to see an addition to the original story. However, the success of The Godfather Part II began the Hollywood tradition of numbered sequels. The movie was released in 1974 and went on to receive tremendous critical acclaim, with many deeming it <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>predecessor.</b> It was nominated for 11 Academy Awards and received 6 Oscars, including 3 for Coppola: Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Director.|$|E

Six of the album's nineteen tracks are designated as AllMusic [...] "picks". Chris Heim wrote for the Chicago Tribune that the album is a rare example of success for a [...] "quirky cult band" [...] signed to a major label. Steve Simels, writing for Stereo Review, compared the album's structural complexities to The Beach Boys {{at the peak of}} their career. Simels praised the album's originality and intellect, while heavily criticizing other contemporary music for lacking those characteristics. Writing in Spin, Ira Robbins called Flood [...] "another captivating variety show of art-rock, swing, the Bonzo Dog Band, cow-pop, show tunes and the Schmenge Brothers... Boundless imagination, loopy mix-and-match arrangements and a gyroscopic sense of what makes a pop tune click are still responsible for the easy and abiding appeal of TMBG's ingenious material." ...|$|R

40|$|As the new-generation {{distributed}} computing platform, cloud computing environments offer high efficiency and low cost for data-intensive computation in big data applications. Cloud resources {{and services are}} available in payas- you-go mode, which brings extraordinary flexibility and costeffectiveness as well as zero investment in their own computing infrastructure. However, these advantages come at a price - people no longer have direct {{control over their own}} data. Based on this view, data security becomes a major concern in the adoption of cloud computing. Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE) is essential to a security system that is based on high efficiency symmetric-key encryption. With virtualization technology being applied, existing key exchange schemes such as Internet Key Exchange (IKE) becomes time-consuming when directly deployed into cloud computing environment. In this paper we propose a novel hierarchical key exchange scheme, namely Cloud Background Hierarchical Key Exchange (CBHKE). Based on our previous work, CBHKE aims at providing secure and efficient scheduling for cloud computing environment. In our new scheme, we design a two-phase layer-by-layer iterative key exchange strategy to achieve more efficient AKE without sacrificing the level of data security. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that when deployed in cloud computing environment, efficiency of the proposed scheme is dramatically <b>superior</b> <b>to</b> <b>its</b> <b>predecessors</b> CCBKE and IKE schemes...|$|R
