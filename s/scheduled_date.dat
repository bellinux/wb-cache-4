5|$|In 2008, Warner Premiere was {{planning}} a direct-to-video sequel to Deep Blue Sea, {{which would be}} released sometime in 2009. However, the project was never realized, nor released on the <b>scheduled</b> <b>date.</b> In June 2017, {{it was announced that}} a sequel directed by Darin Scott had begun filming in Cape Town, South Africa. The film stars Michael Beach and will be released as a television film on the SyFy Channel.|$|E
5|$|Both Pavilions were {{scheduled}} to be unveiled on June 19, 2009. However, the Pavilion by Hadid endured construction delays and a construction team change, which led to nationwide coverage of the delay in publications such as The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. Only its skeleton was availed to the public on the <b>scheduled</b> <b>date,</b> and the work was completed and unveiled on August 4, 2009. The van Berkel pavilion endured a temporary closure due to unanticipated wear and tear from August 1014.|$|E

5|$|The opening {{was planned}} for 18 October 1968, but was delayed to the {{following}} year after the airport was flooded {{a week before the}} <b>scheduled</b> <b>date.</b> The construction work resulted in a legal dispute between the municipality and the consulting company Norsk Teknisk Byggekontroll. The initial filling of earthwork had proved insufficient, so additional earthwork had to be filled, costing an additional NOK840,000. The municipality demanded that the consulting company cover NOK250,000 of the extra cost.|$|E
5|$|To prepare {{these forces}} the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (German High Command) {{increased}} the call-up age range and recruited from Eastern European countries controlled by German forces, increasing manpower on the Western Front from roughly 400,000 {{to just over}} 1 million soldiers. Hastily organized into new divisions, these infantrymen lacked training and sometimes even weapons. Despite an immense German effort {{in the face of}} intense Allied bombing to build the necessary stocks for the offensive, there were shortages of fuel, ammunition, weapons and manpower by the <b>scheduled</b> <b>date</b> of the counterattack. Even the elite Waffen-SS divisions were often deficient in manpower.|$|E
5|$|Works at Morgantown were {{undertaken}} by DuPont under a cost-plus fixed fee contract, {{as was the}} works at Wabash and Alabama. Construction commenced on 7 January 1943, and was substantially completed ahead of the 1 September <b>scheduled</b> <b>date.</b> The facilities were progressively brought into operation between 29 May and 28 August 1943. The cost was $3,490,069. DuPont's fixed fee was originally $154,882, but this was voluntarily reduced to $88,588 because the cost of construction was considerably less than the $6,034,000 originally estimated.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} <b>scheduled</b> <b>date</b> {{of entry}} into service for the MRA4 was April 2003; however, development proved far more protracted than anticipated. Early on, an independent company, Flight Refuelling Ltd., had been contracted to undertake the conversions to MRA4 standard, however BAE discovered that the Nimrod airframes supplied by the RAF were not built to a common standard and this considerably complicated the refurbishment process. The task of converting the existing airframes was transferred in-house to BAE Systems Woodford. The BAE team at Woodford then found that the new wing was flawed, {{which resulted in the}} project being put on hold while another wing design was developed.|$|E
5|$|The {{show was}} {{originally}} {{scheduled to take}} place 20 March 2016, however, after {{it was announced that}} President Barack Obama was scheduled to arrive on the same day, concerns were raised and {{the decision was made to}} reschedule the concert to 25 March 2016. Shortly before the rescheduled concert date, Pope Francis attempted to delay it, asking that the band play on a later date as the concert was scheduled for 25 March 2016, which was Good Friday, a major and solemn Christian holiday. The Vatican also suggested that the band delay the start of their concert until midnight to avoid the holy day. However, the Stones opted to play the concert at the originally <b>scheduled</b> <b>date</b> and time.|$|E
5|$|His goals {{also helped}} Darlington reach {{the second round}} proper (last 32) of the 1919–20 FA Cup. Healey scored twice against Bishop Auckland in the fifth {{qualifying}} round, and repeated the feat in the sixth, as well as creating two for Aaron Travis, as Darlington beat Southern League club Norwich City 5–0. In the first round proper, Darlington faced Sheffield Wednesday of the First Division. A damaged shoulder meant Healey was unfit for the <b>scheduled</b> <b>date,</b> but a waterlogged Feethams pitch gave him an extra few days to recover. The match ended goalless; Healey was unusually indecisive in front of goal, and was standing in an offside position when Travis did put {{the ball in the}} net. Although reported doubtful for the replay, he did appear, pressuring goalkeeper Arnold Birch into conceding a corner from which Darlington took the lead– the goal variously attributed to George Stevens or to Healey himself. He missed the second-round tie at Birmingham because his wife was ill; Darlington lost 4–0.|$|E

5|$|Much of Sibelius's reputation, {{during his}} {{lifetime}} and subsequently, derived from {{his work as a}} symphonist. His Seventh Symphony of 1924 has been widely recognised as a landmark in the development of symphonic form, and at the time {{there was no reason to}} suppose that the flow of innovative orchestral works would not continue. However, after the symphonic poem Tapiola, completed in 1926, his output was confined to relatively minor pieces and revisions to earlier works. During the 1930s the Eighth Symphony's premiere was promised to Serge Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra on several occasions, but as each <b>scheduled</b> <b>date</b> approached Sibelius demurred, claiming that the work was not ready for performance. Similar promises made to the British conductor Basil Cameron and to the Finnish Georg Schnéevoigt likewise proved illusory. It is thought that Sibelius's perfectionism and exalted reputation prevented him ever completing the symphony to his satisfaction; he wanted it to be even better than his Seventh.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} recommenced its explorations in May 1860. Raynolds led a party {{north and}} west up the upstream portion of the Bighorn River, which is today called the Wind River, hoping to cross the mountains at Togwotee Pass in the Absaroka Range, a mountain pass known to expedition guide Jim Bridger. Meanwhile, Maynadier led his party back north to the Bighorn River to explore it and its associated tributary streams more thoroughly. The plan was for the two parties to reunite on June 30, 1860 at Three Forks, Montana, so they could make observations of a total solar eclipse forecast for July 18, 1860. Hampered by towering basaltic cliffs and deep snows, Raynolds attempted for over a week to reconnoiter {{to the top of}} Togwotee Pass, but was forced south due to the June 30 deadline for reaching Three Forks. Bridger then led the party south over another pass in the northern Wind River Range that Raynolds named Union Pass, to the west of which lay Jackson Hole and the Teton Range. From there the expedition went southwest, crossing the southern Teton Range at Teton Pass and entering Pierre's Hole in present-day Idaho. Though Raynolds and his party managed to get to Three Forks by the <b>scheduled</b> <b>date,</b> Maynadier's party was several days late, which prevented a detachment heading north to observe the solar eclipse. The reunited expedition then headed home, traveling from Fort Benton, Montana, to Fort Union near the Montana-North Dakota border via steamboat. It then journeyed overland to Omaha, Nebraska, where the expedition members were disbanded in October 1860.|$|E
