5000|$|LP5 was {{released}} on October 26, 1998 on Nothing Records in the US, with the label releasing Plaid's Not For Threes and Squarepusher's Big Loada the same day. Two tracks from the album, [...] "Vose In" [...] and [...] "Corc," [...] also appeared on the Nothing Records compilation Nothing Changes, which was included with a 1998 issue of XLR8R Magazine. Autechre {{would continue to be}} licensed by Nothing Records until 2000, with Nothing working in tandem with Warp to release nearly all of the duo's new material in the US during this period. In 1999, Nothing released Autechre's Peel Session (a live recording from John Peel's legendary radio show - a second session of which {{was released}} by Warp in 2000) and EP7. The Warp CD edition of EP7 included a hidden track 00, which could be heard by <b>starting</b> <b>track</b> one of the CD, then rewinding backwards. Manufacturing issues prevented the hidden track 00 from inclusion on the Nothing Records edition. Also in 1999, Autechre released the SplitRmx12 promo-only 12", which featured an Autechre cover of Neu!. While SplitRmx12 never received any official release through Nothing Records, Warp pressed 3,000 copies, with 500 assigned to the UK. A portion were assigned to the US, for which Nothing Records assisted in North American distribution to US record stores, on behalf of Warp.|$|E
5000|$|Origins of folk jazz can {{be traced}} back to the fifties, when artists like Jimmy Giuffre and Tony Scott pursued {{distinct}} approaches to folk music production, initially, as a vehicle for soloist expression, and its apex is usually referenced as happening during the middle and latter parts of the sixties (a background it shares with other contemporary hybrid genres, such as psychedelic folk), when some already established folk musicians incorporated diverse musical traditions into their works, and many already popular musical styles underwent a process of massive diversification as many counter-culture-related bands embraced a spirit of free experimentation and inclusiveness reflected in their works each time more frequently (a trend that, after becoming widespread, would be continued in the following decade). For instance, Bob Dylan's 1966 double album Blonde on Blondes <b>starting</b> <b>track,</b> [...] "Rainy Day Women No. 12 & 35", blends various Americana traditions with a jazzy rhythm. In 1968, Van Morrison released the influential Astral Weeks, a mixture of folk, jazz, blues, soul and classical music. In 1969, Tim Buckley released Happy Sad, an album in which he hinted at his early jazz influences - most notably Miles Davis - by infusing his folk-based songs with a non-traditional jazz timbre (a decision that negatively impacted his sales figures by alienating him from his audience). Pentangle's album from that same year, Basket of Light, too, exhibited a certain degree of folk jazz experimentation, amidst other releases from that time, the majority of which were not as commercially successful. Further developments occurred during the seventies, as evidenced in albums like Nick Drake's Bryter Layter, Joni Mitchell's Hejira, and various works originating in the progressive rock and folk rock scenes, which continued the exploration of this genre.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIntracellular {{trafficking}} of organelles {{often involves}} cytoskeletal track switching. Organelles such as melanosomes are transported by multiple motors including kinesin- 2, dynein, and myosin-V, which drive switching between microtubules and actin filaments during dispersion and aggregation. Here, we used optical trapping {{to determine the}} unitary and ensemble forces of kinesin- 2, and to reconstitute cargo switching at cytoskeletal intersections in a minimal system with kinesin- 2 and myosin-V motors bound to beads. Single kinesin- 2 motors exerted forces up to ∼ 5 pN, similar to kinesin- 1. However, kinesin- 2 motors {{were more likely to}} detach at submaximal forces, and the duration of force maintenance was short as compared to kinesin- 1. In multimotor assays, force increased with kinesin- 2 density but was not affected by the presence of myosin-V. In crossed filament assays, switching frequencies of motor-bound beads were dependent on the <b>starting</b> <b>track.</b> At equal average forces, beads tended to switch from microtubules onto overlying actin filaments consistent with the relatively faster detachment of kinesin- 2 at near-maximal forces. Thus, in addition to relative force, switching probability at filament intersections is determined by the dynamics of motor-filament interaction, such as the quick detachment of kinesin- 2 under load. This may enable fine-tuning of filament switching in the cell...|$|E
