40|$|Oilseed rape {{is known}} to persist in arable fields because {{of its ability to}} develop <b>secondary</b> seed <b>dormancy</b> in certain agronomic and {{environmental}} conditions. If conditions change, rapeseeds are able to germinate up to 10 years later to build volunteers in ensuing crops.

Genetically-modified oilseed rape—cultivated widely in Northern America since 1996 —is assumed not to differ from its conventional form in this property. Here, experimental data are reported from official monitoring activities that verify these assumptions. At two former field trial sites in Saxony-Anhalt genetically-modified herbicide-resistant oilseed rape volunteers are found up to fifteen years after harvest.

40|$|Background Understanding the {{relationship}} between environment and genetics requires the integration of knowledge on the demographic behavior of natural populations. However, the demographic performance and genetic composition of Arabidopsis thaliana populations in the species' native environments remain largely uncharacterized. This information, {{in combination with the}} advances on the study of gene function, will improve our understanding on the genetic mechanisms underlying adaptive evolution in A. thaliana. Methodology/Principal Findings We report the extent of environmental, demographic, and genetic variation among 10 A. thaliana populations from Mediterranean (coastal) and Pyrenean (montane) native environments in northeast Spain. Geographic, climatic, landscape, and soil data were compared. Demographic traits, including the dynamics of the soil seed bank and the attributes of aboveground individuals followed over a complete season, were also analyzed. Genetic data based on genome-wide SNP markers were used to describe genetic diversity, differentiation, and structure. Coastal and montane populations significantly differed in terms of environmental, demographic, and genetic characteristics. Montane populations, at higher altitude and farther from the sea, are exposed to colder winters and prolonged spring moisture compared to coastal populations. Montane populations showed stronger <b>secondary</b> seed <b>dormancy,</b> higher seedling/juvenile mortality in winter, and initiated flowering later than coastal populations. Montane and coastal regions were genetically differentiated, montane populations bearing lower genetic diversity than coastal ones. No significant isolation-by-distance pattern and no shared multilocus genotypes among populations were detected. Conclusions/Significance Between-region variation in climatic patterns can account for differences in demographic traits, such as <b>secondary</b> seed <b>dormancy,</b> plant mortality, and recruitment, between coastal and montane A. thaliana populations. In addition, differences in plant mortality can partly account for differences in the genetic composition of coastal and montane populations. This study shows how the interplay between variation in environmental, demographic, and genetic parameters may operate in natural A. thaliana populations.

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Field {{and growth}} chamber studies were {{conducted}} to ascertain the effects of some environmental factors on the persistence of viable buried seed of Agrostis tenuis, Avena fatua, Lolium multiflorum, Lolium perenne, and Poa annua. Through {{the use of a}} population model, specific effects of environment on parameters of viability and nonviability were studied. The parameters of viability included seed quiescence and terminal dormancy. In situ germination and nonviability among ungerminated seed plus their composite, total nonviability, comprised the parameters of nonviability. Of the five species studied, only buried seed of L. perenne was found to be nonpersistent. Variation in the degree of persistence was found among different seed lots of L. multiflorum. Quiescence among buried seed of the persistent species was greater at deeper burial depths. Nonviability among buried seed was found to be less extensive at deeper burial depths. Seed samples of persistent species recovered from burial under perennial ryegrass plant cover displayed higher levels of terminal dormancy than similar samples recovered from indigenous weed, wheat and alfalfa plots. Low soil temperature and high soil moisture, characteristic of winter conditions in western Oregon, were effective in maintaining viability of buried seed. These conditions were also found to be conducive to the induction of <b>secondary</b> seed <b>dormancy.</b> The depletion of viable, buried seeds through in situ germination occurred at intermediate soil temperatures and soil moisture. Such conditions prevail in western Oregon during autumn and spring periods. High temperature and soil moisture percentage was found to increase non-viability among ungerminated seed.

With the progression of time, terminal dormancy played an increasingly important role as a mode of buried seed persistence.

40|$|Abstract Background The genus Populus {{includes}} poplars, aspens and cottonwoods, {{which will}} be collectively referred to as poplars hereafter unless otherwise specified. Poplars are the dominant tree species in many forest ecosystems in the Northern Hemisphere and are of substantial economic value in plantation forestry. Poplar has been established as a model system for genomics studies of growth, development, and adaptation of woody perennial plants including <b>secondary</b> xylem formation, <b>dormancy,</b> adaptation to local environments, and biotic interactions. Results As part of the poplar genome sequencing project {{and the development of}} genomic resources for poplar, we have generated a full-length (FL) -cDNA collection using the biotinylated CAP trapper method. We constructed four FLcDNA libraries using RNA from xylem, phloem and cambium, and green shoot tips and leaves from the P. trichocarpa Nisqually- 1 genotype, as well as insect-attacked leaves of the P. trichocarpa × P. deltoides hybrid. Following careful selection of candidate cDNA clones, we used a combined strategy of paired end reads and primer walking to generate a set of 4, 664 high-accuracy, sequence-verified FLcDNAs, which clustered into 3, 990 putative unique genes. Mapping FLcDNAs to the poplar genome sequence combined with BLAST comparisons to previously predicted protein coding sequences in the poplar genome identified 39 FLcDNAs that likely localize to gaps in the current genome sequence assembly. Another 173 FLcDNAs mapped to the genome sequence but were not included among the previously predicted genes in the poplar genome. Comparative sequence analysis against Arabidopsis thaliana and other species in the non-redundant database of GenBank revealed that 11. 5 % of the poplar FLcDNAs display no significant sequence similarity to other plant proteins. By mapping the poplar FLcDNAs against transcriptome data previously obtained with a 15. 5 K cDNA microarray, we identified 153 FLcDNA clones for genes that were differentially expressed in poplar leaves attacked by forest tent caterpillars. Conclusion This study has generated a high-quality FLcDNA resource for poplar and the third largest FLcDNA collection published to date for any plant species. We successfully used the FLcDNA sequences to reassess gene prediction in the poplar genome sequence, perform comparative sequence annotation, and identify differentially expressed transcripts associated with defense against insects. The FLcDNA sequences will be essential to the ongoing curation and annotation of the poplar genome, in particular for targeting gaps in the current genome assembly and further improvement of gene predictions. The physical FLcDNA clones will serve as useful reagents for functional genomics research in areas such as analysis of gene functions in defense against insects and perennial growth.

Unchilled seeds required light for germination. A moist-chilling treatment at 4 C for 28 to 30 days removed this primary dormancy. Chilled seeds now germinated in the dark. When chilled seeds were held in the dark in − 8. 6 bars polyethylene glycol 6000 solution at 15 C or in water at 29 C a <b>secondary</b> <b>dormancy</b> was induced which increased progressively with time as determined by subsequent germination.

Continuous light or daily brief red light irradiations during prolonged imbibition in polyethylene glycol solution at 15 C or in water at 29 C prevented {{the establishment of the}} <b>secondary</b> <b>dormancy</b> and caused an advancement of subsequent germination. Far red irradiations immediately following red irradiation reestablished the <b>secondary</b> <b>dormancy</b> indicating phytochrome participation in “pregerminative” processes.

Incubation at 30 degrees C results in a progressive loss of the ability to germinate at 15 degrees C.

Such changes are not observed at 0. 45 g H 2 O g 1 DW. Incubation at 30 degrees C also results in an increase in expression of genes involved in GA catabolism (HvGA 2 ox 1, HvGA 2 ox 3 and HvGA 2 ox 5) and synthesis (HvGA 3 ox 2, HvGA 20 ox 1 and HvGA 20 ox 3).

40|$|A {{study of}} photoinhibition of seed {{germination}} and the induction of <b>secondary</b> <b>dormancy</b> {{has been made}} on weedy species that tend to produce large numbers of small, light-sensitive seeds. Both light-requiring (e. g., Chenopodium album) and light-inhibited (e. g., Amaranthus caudatus) species were used but nevertheless were found to show similar responses to high fluence irradiation, differences being largely ones of varying sensitivity. All species tested (except Digitalis purpurea) showed a marked inhibition of germination in continuous fluorescent white light supplemented with far-red compared to the response to fluorescent white light only. Urtica urens and A. caudatus germination, however, could be inhibited by fluorescent white light only and this response was dependent on both time and fluence rate. Interestingly, A. caudatus is a dark germinator whereas U. urens is light requiring (i. e., {{a small amount of}} light promotes germination but a large amount is inhibitory). The inhibitory action of prolonged light is dependent on photon fluence rate. In photoinhibition mediated through phytochrome cycling rate of the pigment appears to be important. However, cycling rate per se cannot explain all the observed responses; and the interuption of dark processes is another important factor. Cycling rate effects are increased when photoequilibrium is low. There is also a blue light photoreceptor of unknown form which shows fluence dependent characteristics in its photoinhibitory activity. <b>Secondary</b> <b>dormancy</b> is induced in seeds which have the ability to germinate but are prevented from doing so. In respect to the light environment, the same light conditions which inhibit germination also tend to induce <b>secondary</b> <b>dormancy</b> although there is no direct evidence on the action of blue light operating through the blue photoreceptor. The depth of <b>secondary</b> <b>dormancy</b> increases with the time of incubation in the inhibitory conditions and also is deeper for low photoequilibrium and high photon fluence rate. High photon fluence rate fluorescent white light inhibits the germination of U. urens but the high photoequilibrium established allows the seed to germinate in subsequent darkness. Photoinhibition of germination and induction of <b>secondary</b> <b>dormancy</b> have adaptive advantages for survival of the species since seedlings can avoid the competitive stresses of a stand of vegetation and the desiccating environment of the soil surface in full sunlight.

40|$|International audienceGermination {{of primary}} dormant barley grains is {{promoted}} by darkness and temperatures below 20 degrees C, but is strongly inhibited by blue light. Exposure under blue light at 10 degrees C for periods longer than five days, {{results in a}} progressive inability to germinate in the dark, considered as <b>secondary</b> <b>dormancy.</b> We demonstrate that the inhibitory effect of blue light is reinforced in hypoxia. The inhibitory effect of blue light is associated {{with an increase in}} embryo abscisic acid (ABA) content (by 3. 5 - to 3. 8 -fold) and embryo sensitivity to both ABA and hypoxia. Analysis of expression of ABA metabolism genes shows that increase in ABA mainly results in a strong increase in HvNCED 1 and HvNCED 2 expression, and a slight decrease in HvABA 8 OH- 1. Among the gibberellins (GA) metabolism genes examined, blue light decreases the expression of HvGA 3 ox 2, involved in GA synthesis, increases that of GA 2 ox 3 and GA 2 ox 5, involved in GA catabolism, and reduces the GA signalling evaluated by the HvExpA 11 expression. Expression of <b>secondary</b> <b>dormancy</b> is associated with maintenance of high embryo ABA content and a low HvExpA 11 expression. The partial reversion of the inhibitory effect of blue light by green light also suggests that cryptochrome might be involved in this hormonal regulation. This work demonstrates that blue light inhibits the germination of primary dormant grains placed at low temperature (10 degrees C), and that exposure longer than 5 days under blue light induces of <b>secondary</b> <b>dormancy.</b> The inability of primary dormant grains to germinate under blue light and induction of <b>secondary</b> <b>dormancy</b> are correlated with an increase in embryo ABA content resulting from an induction of the HvNCED genesand a decrease in HvABA 8 OH- 1 gene expression.

Seasonal seedling recruitment was the result of two fates: seed death in the shallow seedbank, irrespective of dormancy potential, and increased ungerminability in buried seeds which was related to secondary seed dormancy potential. Among the factors that contribute to secondary seed dormancy potential, genotype was of greatest significance. Seed size was of lesser importance, while the contributions of pre-harvest factors including seed maturity, year, and location were negligible in comparison. Differences in ABA synthesis and the response to ABA application were related to secondary seed dormancy potential and correlated well previous reports linking ABA to seed dormancy. Conclusions that emerge from this research are i) that on some farms, seedbank additions may be lowered by more diligent harvest practices, ii) seedbank persistence of B. napus may be reduced by growing low dormancy genotypes and avoiding seed burial for one year after seedbank establishment and iii) ABA + ABA-glucose ester (ABA-GE) and the ability of seeds to respond to ABA application after seed dormancy induction may potentially be used to identify seed dormancy potential in this species...|$|E
40|$|Cell cycle {{activities}} are initiated following imbibition of non-dormant seeds. However, {{it is not}} known whether cell cycle related events other than DNA replication also remain suppressed in imbibed dormant seeds. The objective {{of this study was to}} demonstrate that the transitions between the non-dormant and dormant (both primary and secondary) states are reflected in cell cycle events, such as DNA replication and the changing patterns of the microtubular cytoskeleton involved in the processes of growth and development. The present studies were conducted on seeds from tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum cv. Moneymaker) that possessed primary dormancy or were manipulated to attain <b>secondary</b> <b>dormancy.</b> In addition, a non-dormant abscisic acid (ABA) -deficient mutant, sitw, was used. DNA replication, as measured by flow cytometry, and -tubulin accumulation, analysed by immunoblotting, were compared with immunocytological studies of active DNA synthesis and microtubular cytoskeleton formation. It is shown that the depth of dormancy, which distinguishes primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>dormancy,</b> may depend on the progression of the cell cycle prior to the induction of dormancy...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn barley, primary dormant grains did not {{germinate}} at 30 C in air and at 15 C in {{an atmosphere}} containing less than 10 % O- 2, while they germinated easily at 15 C in air. O- 2 tension in embryos measured with microsensors was 15. 8 % at 15 C but only 0. 3 % at 30 C. Incubation of grains at 30 C is known to induce <b>secondary</b> <b>dormancy</b> in barley, and it was shown here that <b>secondary</b> <b>dormancy</b> was also induced by a 3 d treatment in O- 2 tensions lower than 10 % at 15 C. After such treatments, the grains lost their ability to germinate subsequently at 15 C in air. During seed treatment in 5 % O- 2, embryo abscisic acid (ABA) content decreased more slowly than in air and was not altered after transfer into air. Hypoxia did not alter the expression of ABA metabolism genes after 1 d, and induction of HvNCED 2 occurred only after 3 d in hypoxia. Embryo sensitivity to ABA was similar in both primary and hypoxia-induced secondary dormant grains. Gibberellic acid (GA) metabolism genes were highly regulated and regulated earlier by the hypoxia treatment, with major changes in HvGA 2 ox 3, HvGA 3 ox 2 and HvGA 20 ox 1 expression after 1 d, resulting in reduced GA signalling. Although a high temperature has an indirect effect on O- 2 availability, the data showed {{that it did not}} affect expression of prolyl- 4 -hydroxylases and that induction of <b>secondary</b> <b>dormancy</b> by hypoxia at 15 C or by high temperature in air involved separate signalling pathways. Induction by hypoxia at 15 C appears to be more regulated by GA and less by ABA than the induction by high temperature...|$|E
40|$|Background {{and aims}} Lomatium dissectum (Apiaceae) is a perennial, {{herbaceous}} plant of wide distribution in Western North America. At {{the time of}} dispersal, L. dissectum seeds are dormant and have underdeveloped embryos. The aims of this work were to determine the requirements for dormancy break and germination, to characterize the type of seed dormancy, and {{to determine the effect}} of dehydration after embryo growth on seed viability and <b>secondary</b> <b>dormancy.</b> Methods The temperature requirements for embryo growth and germination were investigated under growth chamber and field conditions. The effect of GA 3 on embryo growth was also analyzed to determine the specific type of seed dormancy. We tested the effect of dehydration on seed viability and induction of <b>secondary</b> <b>dormancy</b> in seeds where embryos had elongated about four fold their initial length. Most experiments examining the nature of seed dormancy were conducted with seeds collected at one site in two different years. To characterize the degree of variation in dormancy breaking requirements among seed populations, we compared the stratification requirements of seeds collected at eig different sites. Key results Embryo growth prior to and during germination occurred at temperatures between 3 and 6 °C and was negligible at stratification temperatures of 0. 5 and 9. 1 °C. Seeds buried in the field and exposed to natural winter conditions showed similar trends. Interruption of the cold stratification period by eight weeks of dehydration decreased seed viability by about 30 % and induced <b>secondary</b> <b>dormancy</b> in the remaining viable seeds. Comparison of the cold stratification requirements of different seed populations indicates that seeds collected from moist habitats have longer cold stratification requirements that those from semiarid environments. Conclusions Seeds of L. dissectum have deep complex morphophysiological dormancy. The requirements for dormancy break and germination reflect an adaptation to trigger germination in late winter...|$|E
40|$|The {{seasonal}} {{timing of}} plant development is regulated by environmental cues. Flowering time {{is influenced by}} the temperature and photoperiod experienced during vegetative growth, while germination timing is affected by temperatures during seed maturation and after dispersal. The timing of each developmental transition also determines seasonal conditions experienced during subsequent life stages, however the significance and stability of these interactions are not well understood. This work aimed to further an understanding of the environmental regulation of plant phenology by creating a multi-stage life history model based on Arabidopsis thaliana. Laboratory and field studies were used to inform predictive models of seed development and seed dormancy. The time required to complete seed development was mainly affected by temperature, and was therefore sensitive to seasonal flowering time. Mean daily temperatures at the end of seed maturation had the greatest influence on rates of primary dormancy loss, and post-dispersal temperatures determined rates of <b>secondary</b> <b>dormancy</b> induction. Germination probabilities were predicted by modelling frequencies of primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>dormancy</b> within the seed population. This revealed an abrupt switch from low to high germination when mean daily temperatures exceeded 14 °C. Thermoinhibition was also predicted at high temperatures due to rapid <b>secondary</b> <b>dormancy</b> induction. Combining models with a previously described model of flowering time provided a framework for investigating the effects of perturbations on entire life history phenology. Seed set timing in spring and winter annuals was consistently predicted to coincide with mean daily temperatures of 14 °C in locations across Northern Europe, resulting in the production of both dormant and non-dormant offspring. Phenotypic plasticity at each growth phase also served to buffer against modest perturbations in germination date, flowering date, and climate in order to maintain these specific dispersal conditions. This result was interpreted as evidence for a robust bet-hedging germination strategy...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Arabidopsis thaliana seeds without {{functional}} SEED MATURATION PROTEIN 1 (SMP 1), {{a boiling}} soluble protein predicted {{to be of}} intrinsic disorder, presumed to be a LATE EMBRYOGENESIS ABUNDANT (LEA) family protein based on sequence homology, do not enter <b>secondary</b> <b>dormancy</b> after 3 days at 40 °C. We hypothesized that SMP 1 may protect a heat labile protein involved in the promotion of <b>secondary</b> <b>dormancy.</b> Recombinant SMP 1 and GmPM 28, its soybean (Glycine max), LEA 4 homologue, protected the labile GLUCOSE- 6 -PHOSPHATE DEHYROGENASE enzyme from heat stress, as did a known protectant, Bovine Serum Albumin, whether the LEA protein was in solution or attached {{to the bottom of}} microtiter plates. Maintenance of a biological function for both recombinant LEA proteins when immobilized encouraged a biopanning approach to screen for potential protein interactors. Phage display with two Arabidopsis seed, T 7 phage, cDNA libraries, normalized for transcripts present in the mature, dehydrated, 12 -, 24 -, or 36 -h imbibed seeds, were used in biopans against recombinant SMP 1 and GmPM 28. Phage titer increased considerably over four rounds of biopanning for both LEA proteins, but not for BSA, at both 25 and at 41 °C, regardless o...|$|E
40|$|Respiration of nondormant upper cocklebur (Xanthium pensylvanicum Wallr.) seeds was {{enhanced}} by exogenous C 2 H 4, proportionally to {{the concentration of}} C 2 H 4 and the duration of presoaking of the seeds. Benzohydroxamic acid (BHM) and salicylhydroxamic acid (SHM), inhibitors of alternative respiration, inhibited both the germination of nondormant lower cocklebur seeds and the respiration of the upper seeds presoaked for periods of 12 to 30 hours. Both the growth and respiration of axial and cotyledonary tissues were also inhibited by BHM. Moreover, BHM inhibited both the C 2 H 4 -induced germination of the upper seeds and their C 2 H 4 -stimulated respiration; the inhibition occurred only with concomitant addition of C 2 H 4 and BHM. The respiration of seeds with a <b>secondary</b> <b>dormancy</b> induced by presoaking for prolonged periods was markedly stimulated by C 2 H 4 but not suppressed by BHM. It was suggested that the alternative respiration system {{may be involved in}} the normal germination process of cocklebur seeds, <b>secondary</b> <b>dormancy</b> may result from its inactivation, and C 2 H 4 may exert its germination-promoting action by stimulating the alternative respiration. The effects of BHM and SHM can suggest but not prove the involvement of the alternative respiration in seed germination...|$|E
