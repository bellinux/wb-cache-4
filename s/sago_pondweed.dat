50|$|In the 1930s and 40's Christina Lake was {{considered}} one of the finest canvasback lakes in the world, even being considered equal to Chesapeake Bay for amount of birds. Being a large shallow lake thick with <b>sago</b> <b>pondweed</b> created a virtual duck magnet. At this time wildlife biologists counted an average of 50,000 canvasbacks on the lake per day. The lake claimed nearly 20 percent of the continent's canvasbacks.|$|E

In 2012 the Minnesota DNR also installed a water pump to pump water from the lake into connecting lake pelican to reduce water and have a freeze out now the water and <b>sago</b> <b>pondweed</b> are the best they been in past decade.|$|E
50|$|The canvasback feeds {{mainly by}} diving, {{sometimes}} dabbling, mostly eating seeds, buds, leaves, tubers, roots, snails, and insect larvae. Besides its namesake, wild celery, the canvasback shows {{a preference for}} the tubers of <b>sago</b> <b>pondweed,</b> which can make up 100% of its diet at times. The canvasback has large webbed feet adapted for diving and its bill helps it dig tubers from the substrate. In the late 1930s, studies showed that four-fifths of the food eaten by canvasbacks was plant material. Wild canvasback was a popular table delicacy in fashionable society in the nineteenth century.|$|E

50|$|The lakes {{within the}} Malheur National Wildlife Refuge are {{important}} and irreplaceable foraging areas for migrating waterfowl, waterbirds, and shorebirds and nesting habitat for colonial nesting waterbirds and diving ducks. When <b>sago</b> <b>pondweed</b> is abundant in the lakes, it supports an abundance of canvasbacks, tundra swan, and many other dabbling and diving ducks in large numbers. When environmental conditions are favorable, very high numbers of nesting colonial birds, including white-faced ibis; American white pelican; great and snowy egrets; herons; Franklin’s, California, and ring-billed gulls; Caspian and Forster's terns; and western, Clark’s, and eared grebes, use the lake for nesting. Under favorable environmental conditions, {{the total number of}} nesting colonial waterbird nests have exceeded 10,000. When natural fluctuating water cycles expose mudflats within these lakes, migrant shorebirds use the lakes extensively. In addition, the expansive open water within Malheur Lake provides security for molting geese and ducks that exceeded 10,000 in number from predators. When Harney Lake is full, extensive beds of widgeongrass support well over 300,000 migrating ducks. Faunal remains found in local archaeological sites demonstrate that the lakes within the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge were just as important as foraging and nesting habitat for innumerable migrating and nesting birds for thousands of years into the prehistoric past as they are today. In addition to birds, these lakes once supported large numbers of muskrats, beaver, and mink.|$|E
40|$|Phytoremediation using {{constructed}} wetlands {{has been}} identified as a potential cost effective method for the clean-up of 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT) -contaminated groundwater. The feasibility of employing <b>sago</b> <b>pondweed</b> (Potamogeton pectinatus L.) in wetland remediation systems was determined in growth chamber studies utilizing hydroponic plant cultures. The study objectives were to: identify the tolerance of <b>sago</b> <b>pondweed</b> to TNT; characterize and compare TNT dissipation from water in the presence and absence of this plant species; and examine plant uptake and fate of TNT. ^ Results showed that <b>sago</b> <b>pondweed</b> could tolerate a one-time dose of 5 mg TNT L− 1 without affecting plant growth, development, or physiological competence; however, multiple dosing at this concentration was toxic to the plant. When TNT was applied in successive doses (once every 4 days), <b>sago</b> <b>pondweed</b> could tolerate concentrations of only 0. 5 mg TNT L − 1. Concentrations as high as 60 mg TNT L− 1 did not influence <b>sago</b> <b>pondweed</b> tuber germination; however, the growth of newly emerged plants from tubers was sensitive to concentrations ≥ 20 mg TNT L− 1. ^ In the presence of <b>sago</b> <b>pondweed,</b> TNT dissipation from water occurred at a faster rate than could be explained by photolysis. When incubated with plants, TNT concentrations decreased below HPLC detection limits within 48 to 96 hrs, whereas without plants, only 37 to 56 % of the added TNT was lost a result of photolysis. As TNT concentrations decreased, mono- and di-aminonitrotoluenes increased in both the culture media and whole plant tissues suggesting a reduction reaction occurs as the first phase in TNT metabolism. The principle reduction product identified was 4 -amino- 2, 6 -dinitrotoluene. Plant uptake of TNT was not confirmed since reduction products were isolated inside and outside of plant tissues and the parent compound could not be detected in plant extracts. Evidence that <b>sago</b> <b>pondweed</b> released exudates into the surrounding aqueous media that could degrade TNT was demonstrated. Radiolabel studies revealed that mineralization of the parent compound did not occur in the presence of <b>sago</b> <b>pondweed,</b> but that TNT and its major photolytic product, 1, 3, 5 -trinitrobenzene, were reduced to less toxic compounds. ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1966 Nine {{experiments}} were conducted during 1964 and 1965 {{to study the}} methods of reproduction and mode of spread of <b>sago</b> <b>pondweed</b> (Potamogeton pectinatus) in irrigation systems. Frequent treatments of <b>sago</b> <b>pondweed</b> foliage with aromatic solvent greatly {{reduced the number of}} tubers in the substratum of an irrigation canal. However, complete eradication of all tubers in one irrigation season was not obtained. Ecological investigations revealed that <b>sago</b> <b>pondweed</b> was capable of invading and becoming established in new irrigation channels in one season. The propagules responsible for the establishment of new infestations were tubers and plant fragments. Considerable numbers of <b>sago</b> <b>pondweed</b> seed were transported into the new channels by the water, but no seedlings were found. Sago pond-weed tubers survived freezing temperatures under field conditions. Subsequent studies in the laboratory showed that <b>sago</b> <b>pondweed</b> tubers could become somewhat hardened or conditioned to withstand freezing temperatures. Removal of the parent tuber did not affect the survival of emerged shoots nor did it prevent the growth of excised sprout tips. The main portion of the tuber appeared to have a function other than initiating growth. The study of shoot emergence from tubers indicated a relationship between the weight of the tuber and the depth from which the shoot would emerge. The main portion of the tuber, whose dry weight consists primarily of carbohydrates, may function as a food reserve enabling the shoot to emerge from a considerable depth in the soil. <b>Sago</b> <b>pondweed</b> seeds that had overwintered in a canal bottom gave 15 percent germination in a greenhouse aquarium after a 50 -day period. Seeds that had passed through the digestive tracts of wild-ducks germinated abundantly. However, if the seeds were held in the digestive tract for more than three days, no germination occurred. The storage of <b>sago</b> <b>pondweed</b> seeds at different conditions of temperature and moisture for different periods of time resulted in significant differences in the percentages of germination. Storage of seed in water at 0. 0 degrees C. for 12 days resulted in the highest percentage of germination. The seed germination studies indicated that the importance of seed in the spread of <b>sago</b> <b>pondweed</b> in irrigation systems may be underestimated...|$|E

40|$|Prepared forABSTRACT: A {{simulation}} model for biomass {{dynamics of the}} submersed macrophyte Potamogeton pectinatus L. is presented. The model (POTAM) is based on carbon flow through the vegetation in meter-squared (m 2) water columns. It includes descriptions of several factors that affect biomass dynamics, such as site characteristic changes in climate, temperature, water transparency, water level, pH, and oxygen effects on CO 2 assimilation rate at light saturation, wintering strategies, mechanical control (removal of shoot biomass), and grazing. The characteristics of community and site can be easily modified by the user. POTAM incorporates insight into the processes affecting the dynamics of a <b>sago</b> <b>pondweed</b> community in relatively shallow, hard water (0. 1 - to 6 -m depth; dissolved inorganic carbon concentration> 0. 8 mmol and pH> 6), under ample supply of nitrogen and phosphorus in a pest-, disease-, and competitor-free environment under the prevailing weather conditions. It has been calibrated on data pertaining to a <b>sago</b> <b>pondweed</b> community in the Western Canal near Zandvoort, The Netherlands.

40|$|PURPOSE: This {{research}} {{investigated the}} effects of applying lime (as calcium hydroxide; Ca(OH) 2) either early or later in the life cycle on the growth, survivorship, and reproductive success of <b>Sago</b> <b>Pondweed</b> (Stuckenia pectinatus) in an outdoor experimental mesocosm setting. BACKGROUND: In addition to controlling sediment phosphorus in aquatic systems, lime (CaCO 3 and Ca(OH) 2) applications {{have been shown to}} be effective in both suppressing submersed macrophyte growth and changing species composition in a variety of ponds, small lakes, canals, and dugouts (Babin et al. 1992; Chambers et al. 2001; Prepas et al. 2001 a, 2001 b). The mode of action for controlling growth is believed to be temporarily induced inorganic carbon limitation of photosynthesis at high pH. Symptoms include pigmentation loss and arrested biomass development after treatment (Chambers et al. 2001, James et al. 2005). Other factors such as reduced light availability due to precipitation of calcite may also be involved in growth suppression. The lime dosage and exposure time requirement to suppress growth in this manner are not precisely known as dosage has primarily been targeted at phosphorus removal from the water column via precipitation with calcite rather than at macrophyte control. Another uncertainty is when to apply lime during the plants ’ life cycle for most effective control. The objectives in Phase 2 of this research were to examine {{the effects of}} various lime application dosages during early and later stages of growth on the survivability of a test plant, <b>sago</b> <b>pondweed,</b> grown in experimentally controlled mesocosms.

Emergent and floating-leaf plant species evaluated were cattail (Typha latifolia L.), smartweed (Polygonum hydropiperoides Michx.), pickerelweed (Pontederia cordata L.) and spatterdock (Nuphar advena Aiton). The submersed species evaluations {{were conducted in}} 7000 L mesocosm tanks, and treatment rates included 0, 0. 5 1. 0, 2. 0, and 4. 0 mg/L active ingredient (ai) endothall (dipotassium salt of endothall). The exposure period consisted of a 24 -h flow through half-life for 7 d. The cattail and smartweed evaluation was conducted in 860 L mesocosm tanks, and the spatterdock and pickerelweed evaluations were conducted in 1600 L mesocosm tanks. Treatment rates for the emergent and floating-leafed plant evaluations included 0, 0. 5, 2. 0 and 4. 0 mg/L ai endothall, and the exposure period consisted of removing and replacing half the water from each tank, after each 24 h period for a duration of 120 h.

40|$|Fifty-seven Trumpeter swans (Cygnus buccinator) were {{translocated}} to the Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge and the Bear River Club Company {{in northern}} Utah. The {{purpose of this}} effort was to encourage dispersal of the Rocky Mountain population of Trumpeter swans during the winter, and to reestablish a migratory route to southern wintering grounds. I assessed {{the success of the}} translocation by evaluating 13 translocation criteria proposed in the literature. In this study I addressed two of these criteria in detail by evaluating habitat quality at the translocation sites and by analyzing potential competitive interactions with Tundra swans (Cygnus columbianus). Habitat quality was determined by analyzing the spatial distribution of <b>sago</b> <b>pondweed</b> (Potamogeton pectinatus) tubers in wetland sediments before the fall and after the spring migration of Tundra swans. Sixty-four transects were established within the study sites with 10 sediment cores per transect. Geostatistical procedures were employed to account for autocorrelation between samples. Tuber biomass was not randomly distributed within the studied wetlands. In fact, discrete areas of high values appeared to exist before and after swan foraging. It is not likely that <b>sago</b> <b>pondweed</b> tubers are limiting swan abundance in this system. Thus, the habitat quality of the study sites is sufficient for Trumpeter swan translocation. Potential competitive interactions with Tundra swans were evaluated by examining differences in resource utilization patterns of the two species. I measured body size differences, dietary overlap, resource availability, and the efficiency of extracting available resources. Trumpeter swans appear to benefit from a larger body size and a longer neck because they are more efficient in extracting tubers from the sediment, and are able to exploit tubers to a greater sediment depth than Tundra swans. However, Trumpeter swans incur higher traveling costs due to the larger body size. The trade-off between higher foraging efficiency of Trumpeter swans and higher traveling efficiency of Tundra swans may be a potential mechanism for coexistence. Lack of support by governmental and non-governmental agencies did not allow for more than one year of translocation. Even though the Trumpeter swan translocation in 1996 was successful, I concluded that the Utah translocation program failed because the translocation did not meet translocation goals...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Wildlife Management, 1989 Waterbird use {{and aquatic}} {{vegetation}} {{structure of the}} Arcata Marsh and Wildlife Sanctuary, Humboldt County, California was studied from 9 May 1984 to 21 August 1986. Diurnal waterbird use of each marsh unit was determined by direct counts of all birds on each unit. An average of 2. 4 surveys was conducted at high and also at low tide each week. Percent cover of the marsh units was determined by preparing cover maps from low altitude aerial photographs and standing crop biomass was calculated by harvesting samples from random plots. In Gearheart Marsh the coverage of common cattail alpha latifolia) nearly doubled between April 1985 and September 1987 while marsh pennywort (Hydrocotyle ranunculoides) nearly tripled. In September 198 <b>sago</b> <b>pondweed</b> (Potamogeton pectinatus) covered 77. 2 percent of Gearheart Marsh. The peak <b>sago</b> <b>pondweed</b> standing crop present in Gearheart Marsh was measured in June 1985 (187. 94 grams per square meter ?? 113. 08 g) and in June 1986 (132. 77 grams per square meter ?? 88. 73 g). <b>Sago</b> <b>pondweed</b> was not present in Hauser Marsh in 1985 because the unit was dry {{during the growing season}} but in September 1986, there were 93. 03 (?? 47. 66) grams per square meter. One hundred and seventy four species of birds were observed at the Marsh Project during this study. Of these, 98 species were observed on the water areas and are treated in this report. The total waterbird use-days in 1984 - 85 was 1, 434, 633 and 1, 429, 873 in 1985 - 86. Shorebirds represented 87. 9 percent of all bird use-days and waterfowl, coots and rails accounted for 8. 8 percent. Peak waterbird use occurred during winter, early and late spring in both years with 63. 1 and 61. 0 percent of the annual total bird use-days represented in those three seasons in 1984 - 85 and 1985 - 86 respectively. The lowest waterbird use occurred in summer with 0. 48 and 0. 42 percent of the total annual bird use-days in 1984 - 85 and 1985 - 86 respectively. Most waterbird species using the Marsh Project either had no significant difference in use rates between tide levels or were found in significantly greater numbers at high tide (p< 0. 05). Klopp Lake had the highest percent of the total bird use-days per five hectares in both years because of large and small shorebird use. Gearheart Marsh was second and Hauser Marsh was third in percent of total bird use-days per five hectares in both years because of puddle ducks, coots and diving ducks in Gearheart and coots and small shorebirds in Hauser Marsh. Four bird groups were found in significantly different (p< 0. 05) numbers between years on a marsh-wide basis. The fish-eating diver group occurred in significantly lower numbers in 1985 - 86 compared to 1984 - 85 mostly because of reduced numbers of double-crested cormorants and "other" fish-eating divers in Klopp Lake. Puddle ducks doubled in numbers on a marsh-wide basis because of a 72 percent increase in Gearheart Marsh principally, by green-winged teal (Ana' crecca) and mallards (A. platyrhynchos). Large shorebirds significantly decreased (p< 0. 05) between 1984 - 85 and 1985 - 86 mostly because of a reduction of marbled godwits (Limosa fedoa) and willets (Catoptrophorus semipalmatus) in Klopp Lake. Gulls and terns significantly decreased (p< 0. 05) marsh wide between 1984 - 85 and 1985 - 86, mainly because of a reduction of more than 50 percent in gull and tern use-days at Klopp Lake...|$|E
40|$|Differences in body sizes {{may create}} a {{trade-off}} between foraging efficiency (foraging gains/costs) {{and access to}} resources. Such a trade-off provides a potential mechanism for ecologically similar species to coexist on one resource. We explored this hypothesis for tundra (Cygnus columbianus) and trumpeter swans (Cygnus buccinator), a federally protected species, feeding solely on <b>sago</b> <b>pondweed</b> (Stuckenia pectinata) tubers during fall staging and wintering in northern Utah. Foraging efficiency was higher for tundra swans because this species experienced lower foraging and metabolic costs relative to foraging gains; however, trumpeter swans (a) had longer necks and therefore had access to exclusive resources buried deep in wetland sediments and (b) were more aggressive and could therefore displace tundra swans from lucrative foraging locations. We conclude that body size differentiation is an important feature of coexistence among ecologically similar species feeding on one resource. In situations where resources are limiting and competition for resources is strong, conservation managers will {{need to consider the}} trade-off between foraging efficiency and access to resources to ensure ecologically similar species can coexist on a shared resource...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{done by the}} Nevada Department of Wildlife (NDOW) and the Arizona Fish and Game between 1978 and 1981 {{indicate}} that inadequate cover may be limiting the production and survival of largemouth bass at the Lake Mead National Recreation Area (LMNRA). As {{a result of these}} studies, NDOW initiated a contract in 1986 with the Lake Mead Research Center (LMRC) to investigate means of improving habitat for game fish by introducing natural and/or artificial cover. During Phase I (1986 - 1987) of this contract, the shoreline of Lake Mead was surveyed for aquatic and terrestrial plant growth. Also during this time, submerged Christmas trees and Berkley Fish Habitat Modules were evaluated for their effectiveness in providing cover. Christmas trees appeared to provide cover for juvenile bluegill, a largemouth bass prey species. However, submerged trees lost their structure in about three years. Berkley Habitat Modules {{did not appear to be}} an effective form of cover. The National Park Service (NPS) asked that the introduction of artificial forms of cover not be continued until research was completed on the use of native plant material. Methods for aquatic and terrestrial plant introductions were determined during Phase II (1987 - 1988) of this contract. Other agencies and individuals involved in revegetation of reservoir inundation zones were contacted, and the literature was reviewed for plant material collecting procedures, planting guidelines, and site maintenance. A 2 ̆ 2 Plant Introduction Manual 2 ̆ 2 was compiled based on this information and was approved by the National Park Service for use in the Lake Mead National Recreation Area. During the winter, dormant cuttings were taken of two woody species, Goodding 2 ̆ 7 s Willow and seepwillow baccharis (Salix gooddingii and Baccharis glutinosa) to be planted in the spring of 1988. In addition, collections were made of three emergent species (Typha angustifolia, Scirpus robustus, and Phragmites australis). Plant material was transported to the Nevada Division of Forestry (NDF) nursery where it was rooted and placed on pots for planting in May 1988. <b>Sago</b> <b>pondweed</b> (Potamogeton pectinatus) tubers were introduced into small study plots in the spring of 1987. More tubers became established and were healthier in fertilized plots than in unfertilized plots. During Phase III (1988 - 1989) of this study, plant material was introduced into one cove in the lower basin and two coves in the upper basin of Lake Mead in April and May of 1988. Unpredicted low lake levels resulted in the loss of many plants. Survival rates of rooted material, however, were better than those of direct cuttings of woody plants. Site selection, particularly the soils of the site, appears to play a large part in survival. Seepwillow baccharis had the highest survival rates. In addition, greenhouse studies {{indicate that}} emergent plant tubers have some tolerance to dessication. Twelve hundred <b>sago</b> <b>pondweed</b> tubers were planted in April 1988 in one cove in the upper basin, and 1, 200 tubers were planted in a cove in the lower basin. Tubers had 100 percent germination success and provided 70 percent cover for fish by July 1988. Approximately 10, 000 <b>sago</b> <b>pondweed</b> tubers were planted in April 1989 in Waterbarge Cove in the lower basin. Tubers were planted in water depths ranging from very shallow to 12 - 15 meters deep. Germination and establishment of tubers were very good in depths less than 7 meters; however, little or no germination of tubers was noted at depths greater than 7 meters. A one-acre area of shoreline was hydroseeded in October 1988. Germination and establishment of seedlings was highest where soil moisture was between 20 and 30 percent. However, many seedlings were lost when water levels began to rise in January 1989...|$|E
40|$|A {{simulation}} {{model has been}} developed {{that focuses on the}} ability of two competing submersed macrophytes, meadow-forming and canopy-forming, to maintain their biomass under different environmental conditions. Vallisneria americana (American wildcelery) serves as the example for meadow-forming plants and Stuckenia pectinata (until recently known as Potamogeton pectinatus or <b>sago</b> <b>pondweed)</b> for canopy-forming plants. The model can be used to predict changes in species composition of submersed vegetation as a result of changes in the availability of resources in shallow freshwater bodies. In the model, the two plant species compete for light and exhibit different species-specific relationships between plant tissue nitrogen (N) :phosphorus (P) ratio and plant biomass production. The latter species-specific relationships have not been determined in V. americana and P. pectinatus, and, therefore, for calibration of the model, the specific relationships between plant tissue N:P ratio and reduction in plant biomass production of Zannichellia palustris and Elodea canadensis were used. The latter species have habitat preferences similar to those of V. americana and P. pectinatus. Competition for light proved to be a far more important determinant of species composition than the availabilities of N and P in the sediment...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{research}} reported herein {{investigated the}} effects of a range of lime (as calcium hydroxide; Ca(OH) 2) dosage levels on the growth of <b>Sago</b> <b>pondweed</b> in outdoor experimental mesocosms. BACKGROUND: Lime (CaCO 3 and Ca(OH) 2) application has been used primarily as a lake rehabilitation technique for limiting algal growth by controlling phosphorus availability in the water column and its release from the sediment (Prepas et al. 1990). At supersaturated concentrations, calcium co-precipitates with phosphorus and settles from the water column. As a deposited layer on the sediment, it can adsorb additional phosphorus (at pH> 8), preventing it from diffusing into the water column for algal uptake. More recently, researchers have found that lime additions can suppress submersed macrophyte growth as well (Babin et al. 1992, Chambers et al. 2001, Prepas et al. 2001). However, the mode of growth suppression, dosage levels, and exposure time requirements are not entirely known. Since lime application drives the pH upward, it may stress macrophyte metabolic activities by inducing inorganic carbon limitation for photosynthesis in hardwater systems. Lime additions to aquatic systems at varying concentrations have not resulted in clear macrophyte community responses. For instance, single dosages of lime at modest concentratio...|$|E

Differences in body sizes may create a trade-off between foraging efficiency (foraging gains/costs) {{and access to}} resources. Such a trade-off provides a potential mechanism for ecologically similar species to coexist on one resource. We explored this hypothesis for tundra (Cygnus columbianus) and trumpeter swans (Cygnus buccinator), a federally protected species, feeding solely on <b>sago</b> <b>pondweed</b> (Stuckenia pectinata) tubers during fall staging and wintering in northern Utah. Foraging efficiency was higher for tundra swans because this species experienced lower foraging and metabolic costs relative to foraging gains; however, trumpeter swans (a) had longer necks and therefore had access to exclusive resources buried deep in wetland sediments and (b) were more aggressive and could therefore displace tundra swans from lucrative foraging locations. We conclude that body size differentiation is an important feature of coexistence among ecologically similar species feeding on one resource. In situations where resources are limiting and competition for resources is strong, conservation managers will {{need to consider the}} trade-off between foraging efficiency and access to resources to ensure ecologically similar species can coexist on a shared resource. 1...|$|E
40|$|Animal {{distribution}} is usually predicted from the spatial variation in food biomass, whereas foraging theory commonly uses net energy intake rate as the currency to be maximized. We tested whether net energy intake rate better predicted {{the distribution and}} abundance of tundra swans than food biomass. In a shallow lake, we mapped the density of <b>sago</b> <b>pondweed</b> tubers during 2 years, and calculated the foraging benefits and costs to tundra swans. Swan residence was expressed in bird-days, i. e. the sum of daily counts. We used four measures of increasing complexity to predict bird-days per inlet: total food biomass (B), total food biomass above giving-up density (B+), total accessible food biomass above giving-up density (aB+), and total achievable net energy intake rate above giving-up energy intake rate (NEI+). Considering both years, observed bird-days of inlets correlated only with NEI+, and not with B, B+, or aB+. In both years, our predictions of bird-days based on the NEI+model better matched observed relationships than the predictions {{of the other three}} models. Our case study suggests that in heterogeneous wetlands, correcting for givingup density, food accessibility and foraging costs may be necessary in order to predict bird distribution and abundance. ...|$|E
40|$|We tested whether Tundra Swans use {{information}} on the spatial distribution of cryptic food items (belowground <b>Sago</b> <b>pondweed</b> tubers) to shape their movement paths. In a continuous environment, swans create their own food patches by digging craters, which they exploit in several feeding bouts. Series of short (1 m). Tuber biomass densities showed a positive spatial auto-correlation at a short distance (25 g/m 2) and to a more distant patch (at 7 – 8 m) if the food density in the current patch had been low (3 m) from a low-density patch and a short distance (< 3 m) from a high-density patch. The quantitative agreement between prediction and observation was greater for swans feeding in pairs than for solitary swans. The result of this movement strategy is that swans visit high-density patches at a higher frequency than on offer and, consequently, achieve a 38 % higher long-term gain rate. Swans also take advantage of spatial variance in food abundance by regulating the time in patches, staying longer and consuming more food from rich than from poor patches. We can conclude that {{the shape of the}} foraging path {{is a reflection of the}} spatial pattern in the distribution of tuber densities and can be understood from an optimal foraging perspective. ...|$|E
