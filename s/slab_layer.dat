This delay factor results from difficulties in forming and installing the formwork when a tilting or bending pillar is constructed, and it is considered essential to manage these tasks because of the difficulty in setting up and installing rebars according to the slope. Also, according to the analysis, the delay caused by the construction sequence of the <b>slab</b> <b>layer</b> that should have a high work connection and the order error of the column work is {{due to the lack of}} continuity of the work due to the construction plan which does not sufficiently consider the conditions of the site.|$|E
40|$|The {{observed}} brightness temperatures (Tb) at 37 GHz from typical moderate density {{dry snow}} in mid-latitudes decreases with increasing snow water equivalent (SWE) due to volume scattering {{of the ground}} emissions by the overlying snow. At a certain point, however, as SWE increases, the emission from the snowpack offsets the scattering of the sub-nivean emission. In tundra snow, the Tb slope reversal occurs at shallower snow thicknesses. While it has been postulated that the inflection point in the seasonal time series of observed Tb V 37 GHz of tundra snow {{is controlled by the}} formation of a thick wind <b>slab</b> <b>layer,</b> the simulation of this effect has yet to be confirmed. Therefore, the Dense Media Radiative Transfer Theory for Multi Layered (DMRT-ML) snowpack is used to predict the passive microwave response from airborne observations over shallow, dense, slab-layered tundra snow. Airborne radiometer observations coordinated with ground-based in situ snow measurements were acquired in the Canadian high Arctic near Eureka, NT, in April 2011. The DMRT-ML was parameterized with the in situ snow measurements using a two-layer snowpack and run in two configurations: a depth hoar and a wind slab dominated pack. With these two configurations, the calibrated DMRT-ML successfully predicted the Tb V 37 GHz response (R correlation of 0. 83) when compared with the observed airborne Tb footprints containing snow pits measurements. Using this calibrated model, the DMRT-ML was applied to the whole study region. At the satellite observation scale, observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) over the study area reflected seasonal differences between Tb V 37 GHz and Tb V 19 GHz that supports the hypothesis of the development of an early season volume scattering depth hoar layer, followed by the growth of the late season emission-dominated wind <b>slab</b> <b>layer.</b> This research highlights the necessity to consider the two-part emission characteristics of a slab-dominated tundra snowpack at 37 GHz Tb...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Propagation Saw Test (PST) and the Extended Column Test (ECT) are two {{recently}} and independently developed field tests that indicate the propensity for a <b>slab</b> and weak <b>layer</b> combination to propagate a fracture. University of Calgary researchers performed the PST and ECT throughout the 2008 winter season {{along with other}} standard stability tests to establish their strengths and limitations. The PST and ECT were compared side-by-side in over 80 test pits with close to 600 individual test results throughout the 2008 winter in the Columbia Mountains of British Columbia, Canada. We tested numerous <b>slab</b> and weak <b>layer</b> combinations including tracking four persistent weak layers from initial burial to depths of over two meters. Field observations and initial analysis indicate correlations between <b>slab</b> hardness, weak <b>layer</b> depth, and propagation propensity, and hint at how these snowpack characteristics influence the observed results of each test.

40|$|AbstractSnow layers form {{during and}} after {{accumulation}} due to the interaction of meteorological and physical processes. It is known that the vertical structure and also the lateral continuity of layers depend on these processes and the boundaries set by the terrain. This study addresses the variations seen among vertical penetration resistance profiles and investigates possible forcings at the basin scale. In the past years we acquired a unique dataset with 613 snow micro-penetrometer (SMP) resistance measurements covering a variety of dry-snow conditions. With recent advances in signal processing all snow layer properties required for snow instability modeling are extracted from a SMP signal so that quantitative metrics of the propensity to failure initiation and crack propagation can be calculated. The modeled values of instability corresponded well with field test results obtained during the measurement campaigns and the verified, local danger. We then analyzed whether snow instability was related to simple drivers such as slope aspect, snow depth, and slope angle. In general, aspect was the most prominent driver as on all field days we found associations of our measures of snow instability with aspect. For ‘old’ <b>slab</b> <b>layers</b> the relation between aspect and snow instability was more pronounced than for recently deposited <b>slab</b> <b>layers.</b> However, the relationships between drivers and our measures of snow instability varied depending on whether we analyzed the single field days separately or jointly. Considering all field days jointly, which reflects mean trends over varying snowpack conditions, slope angle was weakly related to the failure initiation propensity and snow depth to the crack propagation propensity. Our findings suggest that with SMP field measurements differences in snow conditions can be resolved which relate to the failure initiation and crack propagation propensity relevant for snow instability assessment. Our analysis of terrain and snow depth data showed that readily and widely available simple drivers {{have the potential to}} enhance snow instability predictions from point measurements at the basin scale...|$|R

Concurrent observations of the wind and currents are crucial to evaluate the directly wind-forced currents. Thus, the wind stress and surface current fields obtained from a regional ocean model, which simulates variability of the wind and surface currents on scales comparable to those in observations, are analyzed with the same statistical parameterization to derive the point-by-point transfer functions and response functions.

40|$|Polymers are {{important}} materials in fabrication of photonics devices {{due to their}} good optical properties, such as, high transmittivity, versatile processability also at low temperatures allowing potential for low-cost fabrication. A critical requirement in the fabrication of integrated optical devices has been selecting a most suitable method for patterning the ridge bounding the optical mode in the waveguide. In this paper, we discuss a UV-imprint fabrication of polymeric single-mode waveguides with different configurations: ridge type, inverted rib type and layered composite waveguides. A ridge waveguide type consists of a strip waveguide superimposed onto a slab waveguide made of the same material. When patterning a ridge by imprinting technique, a residual layer is formed underneath the imprinted ridges. A too thick residual layer might cause a loss of propagation mode due to power leakage to the slab guide, which might require a subsequent etching step. In inverted rib waveguide structure, a groove of cladding material is patterned by imprinting. This {{is followed by the}} filling of the groove with a core material. From the imprint fabrication point of view, the fabrication tolerances can be relaxed because the residual <b>slab</b> <b>layer</b> underneath the waveguide can have arbitrary thickness.

In previous studies, the snow properties derived from the SMP have been related to observed snow properties at Rutschblock and compression test failure planes. The goal {{of this study is}} to show to what extent Rutschblock stability can be derived from SMP measurements. Our analysis is based on measurements at 36 different sites, which each included a Rutschblock test, a manual profile, and up to 8 adjacent SMP measurements, for a total of 262 SMP profiles. A recently improved SMP analysis procedure is used to estimate the micro-structural and mechanical properties of manually defined weak layers and slab layers. SMP signal quality control and different noise treatment methods are taken into consideration in the analysis. The best and most robust predictor of Rutschblock score is the weak layer compressive strength. In combination with the SMP-estimated density of the <b>slab</b> <b>layer,</b> the cross-validated total accuracy of predicting Rutschblock stability classes is 85 % over the entire data set, and 88 % when signals with obvious signal dampening (11 % of the dataset) are removed.

We investigated profiles observed at wet snow avalanche fracture lines (winter 1992 - 2009, 20 profiles) and in slopes where signs of instability like cracking or collapsing were noted at the time of observation (2006 - 2010, 16 profiles). Furthermore, we investigated snowpack properties in southerly aspect start zones before, during and after wet snow avalanche cycles at the regional scale (2002 - 2010, 156 profiles). Investigated parameters include grain shape and size, hand hardness and wet-ness of the failure plane, the <b>slab</b> <b>layer</b> and the bed surface. The failure plane of wet snow avalanches was generally at the interface or within a moist, very soft layer consisting of a mix of melt-freeze, faceted or depth hoar grains. The slab tended to be fully moist, soft and was already transformed to melt-freeze grains for the most part. Typically, in unstable slopes the Rutschblock (RB) score was very low (median score 2) and failed within or at the interface to a soft or very soft layer consisting of moist, coarse facet or depth hoar grains. The comparison of snowpack properties before and during wet snow avalanche cycles showed that significant differences exist in snow temperature, the proportion of the snowpack which is wet and in the wetness of the snowpack. To assess the potential of avalanche failure deep in the snowpack, it is important to determine if soft layers containing coarse, facet or depth hoar grains are present...|$|E
