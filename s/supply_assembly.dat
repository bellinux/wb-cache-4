40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose a {{clustering}} method that configures <b>assembly</b> <b>supply</b> chains. In mass customization, product variety is often characterized by a modular product structure, in which each module may offer several variants to deliver product variants. In this context, <b>assembly</b> <b>supply</b> chain is referred to a network of suppliers who produce and assemble product variants. Given that the proportion of the product variants is specified, the technical problem is how to configure the structure of the <b>assembly</b> <b>supply</b> chain in order to reduce the complexity incurred by product variety. The technical challenge is that the possible number of configurations grows dramatically with the number of product variants. Also, enumerating the possible configurations in a mathematical framework is not a trivial task. Instead of taking an exhaustive approach, the solution approach of this paper is based on hierarchical cluster analysis, in which the tree structure is applied to configure <b>assembly</b> <b>supply</b> chain. The core technique is to investigate the coupling concept in the context of <b>assembly</b> <b>supply</b> chain to characterize the grouping conditions in the structuring process.

40|$|In {{preparation}} for the future deployment of the Space Station, an R and D program was established to demonstrate integrated operation of an alkaline Water Electrolysis System and a fuel cell as an energy storage device. The program's scope was revised when the Space Station Control Board changed the energy storage baseline for the Space Station. The new scope was aimed at {{the development of an}} alkaline Static Feed Electrolyzer for use in an Environmental Control/Life Support System as an oxygen generation system. As a result, the program was divided into two phases. The phase 1 effort was directed at the development of the Static Feed Electrolyzer for application in a Regenerative Fuel Cell System. During this phase, the program emphasized incorporation of the Regenerative Fuel Cell System design requirements into the Static Feed Electrolyzer electrochemical module design and the mechanical components design. The mechanical components included a Pressure Control Assembly, a Water <b>Supply</b> <b>Assembly</b> and a Thermal Control Assembly. These designs were completed through manufacturing drawing during Phase 1. The Phase 2 effort was directed at advancing the Alkaline Static Feed Electrolyzer database for an oxygen generation system.

During this Phase, the Program emphasized three major areas: materials evaluation, electrochemical module scaling and performance repeatability and Static Feed Electrolyzer operational definition and characterization...|$|E
40|$|Automated {{assembly}} {{technology may}} be the key to sustaining manufacturing industry in more developed countries. Currently this comprises dedicated systems that can assemble single products at high volumes and flexible systems to assemble a wide variety of products in low volumes. However, competitive forces demand a compromise between the two and Reconfigurable Assembly Systems are an avenue for achieving high volume and high variety production. Although this technology is coming to the fore, there is a distinct lack of tools and methods that make the prospect attractive to key decision makers in organisations. Reconfigurable solutions, which may be profitable in the long term, are rejected in favour of short term solutions, which prove to be more expensive over time. The benefits of requirements engineering have been exploited in software engineering and this work demonstrates how these can be adapted to an assembly environment to form a new basis for communication between the system vendors, who <b>supply</b> <b>assembly</b> system solutions, and system users, who use them. Knowledge Engineering has become a key aspect in industry due to the challenges of retaining personnel and their knowledge within organisations. This is because employees take their knowledge of the organisation with them when they leave. The retention of this knowledge would help to maintain the continuity within organisations. This thesis reports on research that aims to provide a means to integrate these three aspects to form a basis for sustaining competitive manufacture in more developed countries. Moreover, Knowledge Based Requirements Specification for Reconfigurable Assembly Systems will provide a vital medium for promoting Reconfigurable Assembly Systems and encourage their implementation by providing a knowledge-based platform for the specification of Reconfigurable Assembly Systems...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the fabrication, assessment and application of doped silica waveguides using Flame Hydrolysis Deposition. Deposition apparatus has been designed and constructed. This equipment consists of a gas <b>supply</b> <b>assembly,</b> a bubbler cabinet, a deposition box and a chemical scrubber. An optimum sintering regime for the low density silica soot has been established consisting of 60 minutes at 1250 oC. This regime is dependent on the levels of P 2 O 5, GeO 2 and/or TiO 2 doping in the silica host. Independent control of layer thickness and index is achieved. Refractive index can be varied by changing the doping levels, and thickness, by increasing the number of traversals of the hydrolysing flame. Film homogeneity in terms of layer thickness was found to be difficult to control and up to 30 % variation in thickness was obtained in some samples. Thermophoretic effects were shown to play an important part in the deposition process. Titanium and phosphorus doped films were found to suffer film degradation and aging. This {{led to the formation of}} titanium rich crystals and crystal agglomerates which produced Rayleigh/ Mie scatter in the sintered films. No such problem was found with Germanium, and all films were subsequently fabricated using Germanium and Phosphorus. No out-of-plane scatter was observed in the sintered films. Ridge waveguides were fabricated using lithography and Reactive Ion Etching in a CHF 3 plasma, giving waveguides with smooth side walls. Loss assessment was carried out using two techniques, both of which were non-destructive. One involved a video camera to scan across the waveguide and detect the out-of-plane scatter. This technique was sensitive to scattering centres and was less accurate for short lengths of guide. Loss figure varied from 0. 2 to over 5 dB/cm depending on the scan length. The second technique involved turning the waveguide into a Fabry-Perot resonator, by coating the end faces of the waveguide. Temperature induced cycles in the output intensity could be used to obtain the waveguide attenuation. This technique was sensitive to the facet angles of the guides which could contribute significantly to the loss measured. Such resonances were obtained in only one sample and gave a loss figure of over 9 dB/cm which is considered unreliable. Films were doped with both Nd 3 + and Er 3 + using a solution doping technique and fluorescence spectra were obtained for both. Increased scatter was observed in the planar films with such doping. Holographic gratings were fabricated on planar waveguides with a view to their incorporation as feedback elements in a laser structure. Second Harmonic Generation was observed for the first time in planar rib waveguide structures doped with Phosphorus and Germanium. In a `seeding' experiment where 1064 nm radiation was launched at the same time as a second harmonic `seed', a two-hundred fold increase was observed in generated second harmonic signal over the background level...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} a {{heuristic}} approach to material <b>supplies</b> of <b>assembly</b> lines (e. g. automotive industry) and to optimization of a stacker which is used in production lines or stores. A modern method for <b>supplying</b> <b>assembly</b> lines with material is using the so called ‘milk run’ – trains supplying not only one point in assembly production lines but several points. A graph model is used. An analytical solution for creation of trains is not known; most probably it does not exist. Solutions using “brute force” may be very slow. They cannot be used {{for more than a}} dozen demands. A repeated random selection of n-tuples of transport demands and building of trains from this selection could {{be a good way to}} solve this task. A model of assembly production lines has been developed and the speed of convergence of random selections to a suboptimal solution has been calculated and measured. A thousand selections give good results. These heuristic results have been compared with some deterministic strategies (nearest demand, building of n-tuples). A similar approach has been used for optimization of a stacker in a workshop and in a store...|$|R
