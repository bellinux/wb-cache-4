50|$|Fischer and Jandera {{studied the}} effect of {{changing}} the concentration of methanol on CMC values for three commonly used surfactants. Two cationic, hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), and N-(a-carbethoxypentadecyl) trimethylammonium bromide (Septonex), and one anionic surfactant, <b>sodium</b> <b>dodecyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> (SDS) were chosen for the experiment. Generally speaking, the CMC increased as the concentration of methanol increased. It was then concluded that {{the distribution of the}} surfactant between the bulk mobile phase and the micellar phase shifts toward the bulk as the methanol concentration increases. For CTAB, the rise in CMC is greatest from 0 - 10% methanol, and is nearly constant from 10 - 20%. Above 20% methanol, the micelles disaggregate and do not exist. For SDS, the CMC values remain unaffected below 10% methanol, but begin to increase as the methanol concentration is further increased. Disaggregation occurs above 30% methanol. Finally, for Septonex, only a slight increase in CMC is observed up to 20%, with disaggregation occurring above 25%.|$|E
30|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>dodecyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> was {{purchased}} from Merck Specialities Private Limited India. It was recrystallised several times for purification. The minimum {{in the surface}} tension-concentration plot was observed. The aqueous solutions of purified and unpurified samples of <b>sodium</b> <b>dodecyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> exhibited minimum in the surface tension versus log c plot (c, concentration of <b>sodium</b> <b>dodecyl</b> <b>sulphate).</b> The minimum in the plot of γ versus log c for <b>sodium</b> <b>dodecyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> is considered as due {{to the presence of}} highly surface-active dodecyl alcohol molecules (Lin et al. 1999). Dodecyl alcohol may be present as impurity in the supplied sample of <b>sodium</b> <b>dodecyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> or it may be produced in the <b>sodium</b> <b>dodecyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> solution by its hydrolysis. The cmc of <b>sodium</b> <b>dodecyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> is taken to be the concentration of <b>sodium</b> <b>dodecyl</b> <b>sulphate</b> corresponding to the minimum in the plot of γ versus log c and it is equal to 8.10  mmol kg− 1 {{in the absence of any}} added electrolyte at 25 °C.

30|$|Using {{the revised}} AnBUSDiC test {{procedure}} [5], there were noticeable {{differences in the}} levels of anaerobic biodegradation observed for the six different test substances. When all data submitted by the participating laboratories were included, four of the test substances, FA + 7 EO (a non-ionic linear alcohol ethoxylate), FAS (the anionic <b>sodium</b> <b>dodecyl</b> <b>sulphates),</b> betaine (an amphoteric surfactant) together with the positive control (glucose) were all efficiently anaerobically degraded with mean degradation levels of more than 70 %. Possible anomalous (lower biodegradation percentage) results were observed from participating laboratory 3 for FA + 7 EO and FAS. Exclusion of these two values resulted in higher degradation and improved standard deviation values for these two test products but {{does not change the}} overall conclusion that both these products are efficiently anaerobically degraded. Whilst the degradation of these two substances in laboratory 3 was lower compared with the other labs, degradation of the positive control substance glucose was within the normal range, and therefore, it must be summised that the low values are simply a result of the inherent variability between inoculum sources ability to degrade the test substances. When previously tested under OECD 311 test guidelines, FA + 7 EO was found to be 70 % to 80 % biodegradable in 60 days which supports the ring test data found in this study [1].|$|R

40|$|At present three isoforms of Na,K-ATPase are known, whose {{existence}} {{is determined by}} different α subunits. The isoforms differ in their amino acid com-position and ouabain sensitivity. It is known that the α 1 -isoform has a much lower affinity for ouabain than the α 2 - or α 3 -isoform. It is believed that β-isoforms exist, which {{have not yet been}} investigated [1]. As a rule the Na,K-ATPase reaction takes place with the stoichiometry 3 Na+/ 2 K+/ 1 ATP, but under certain circumstances it may change.
