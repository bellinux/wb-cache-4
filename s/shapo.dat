50|$|The <b>Shapo</b> Reservoir (shaposhuiku) {{is located}} 5 km south of Haikou city, Hainan, China, south of <b>Shapo</b> Village at Chengxi Town. The {{purpose of this}} {{reservoir}} is to prevent floods and conserve water for supply to Haikou. It is roughly 2 km long. A single dam {{is located at the}} east side with an adjacent water outlet. Water released from this dam flows into a spillway and then starts the Meishi River. This narrow river then flows eastward under Longkun Road just south of the Haikou East Railway Station. It then turns north and empties into the Haidian River.Construction of the <b>Shapo</b> Reservoir started in 1959 and was completed in 1964. Reinforcements were made in 2013.|$|E

40|$|Over {{thirty years}} ago, Marshall <b>Shapo</b> {{coined the term}} 2 ̆ 2 {{constitutional}} tort 2 ̆ 2 to denote a suit brought against an official, charging a constitutional violation and seeking damages. 2 ̆ 7 In the years since <b>Shapo</b> 2 ̆ 7 s pathbreaking article, {{the number of such}} suits has grown exponentially. 2 ̆ 7 The suits have generated a host of new substantive and remedial issues, yet conventional casebooks on constitutional law and federal courts give little attention to the area. That Professor Shapiro had four books to include in his review of “Civil Rights” casebooks in the Seattle University Law Review is some indication of a demand for teaching materials currently unmet by federal courts and constitutional law casebook offerings. The premise of our book is that “constitutional torts” present a sufficiently large and complex group of problems to warrant a casebook and a course of their own. We will first discuss why constitutional tort issues tend to receive inadequate attention in courses and casebooks on constitutional law and other civil rights topics. Then we will explain the pedagogic advantages of having a separate offering on constitutional torts...|$|E
40|$|Individual injury law {{was once}} an {{important}} arena for the definition of shared values. It has increasingly become the domain of various species of systems analysts who measure legal results against external norms defined by such disciplines as economics. Although legal scholars continue to use the expectations and beliefs of ordinary {{men and women in}} fashioning rules for the redress of constitutional injuries, common-law scholars have become less willing to ground legal principles in moral consensus. There are notable exceptions. Among these is Professor Marshall <b>Shapo,</b> who, in two recent works, attempts to develop a legal analysis of injury that 2 ̆ 2 requires a substantial component of moral judgment 2 ̆ 2 (Duty, p. xiii), 2 ̆ 2 an analysis centered on humanitarian elements and considerations of fairness 2 ̆ 2 (Duty, p. xv) ...|$|E
