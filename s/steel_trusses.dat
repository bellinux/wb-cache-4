5|$|The {{structural}} {{framework of}} the building utilises a simple system of reinforced concrete beams and slabs, and was originally clad in square mosaic and rectangular ceramic tiles on its walls and columns. The building's foundation comprises large diameter bored piles installed in decomposed sandstone.

The auditorium is roofed over by 24-metre long <b>steel</b> <b>trusses</b> with a composite reinforced concrete covering.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. When the {{scaffold}} construction method is applied on long-span <b>steel</b> <b>trussed</b> arch bridges, reasonable {{setting of the}} temporary pier elevation has significant influence on assembly linearis and safety assembly of long-span <b>steel</b> <b>trussed</b> arch bridges with semi-cantilever. In this paper, {{in accordance with the}} manufacturing linearis <b>steel</b> <b>trussed</b> beam bridge and <b>steel</b> <b>truss</b> beam linearis changing during building process, the calculation of temporary pier elevation was studied systematically, and practical function was deduced. Then, the method was applied to a long-span <b>steel</b> <b>trussed</b> arch bridge. The obtained result by in-situ assembly and dismantling presents that: 50 mm preserved method is considered in this paper, which can provide convenience for removing the temporary pier. At the same time, the rationality and reliability of the presented approach are verified. It also can provide reference for similar bridge construction...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Steel</b> <b>truss</b> {{bridge is}} an {{important}} part of transportation hub and lifeline engineering, it recently has attracted more attention on dynamic performance of <b>steel</b> <b>truss</b> bridge. In this paper, the ANSYS software is used to perform the modal analysis of <b>steel</b> <b>truss</b> bridge, and we find that the main bridge are more sensitive to the vertical earthquake (i. e., Y direction). In the earthquake response spectrum analysis on Y direction, we find that the maximum deformation is at mid-span of <b>steel</b> <b>truss</b> bridge. In the transient analysis of seismic waves, under the action of horizontal and vertical earthquake accelerations, the structure displacement dynamic diagram and time-history displacement curve are obtained and some conclusions are drawn...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, it is {{proposed}} that the simplified calculating method of equivalent beam of assembled type <b>steel</b> <b>truss</b> bridge's deflection. The use of finite element analysis software, the common span bridge's deflection is calculated. It is provided that the maximum deflection of assembled type <b>steel</b> <b>truss</b> bridge is approximately proportional to the span's cube through numerical analysis, {{and it has a}} linear relationship with the maximum deflection of equivalent beam. The space equivalent coefficient is introduced; the space problem is converted into a plane problem. The relational expression between assembled type <b>steel</b> <b>truss</b> bridge and equivalent beam has a fitting while to be strengthened or not strengthened. Therefore, it is provided a simple and feasible method for similar assembled type <b>steel</b> <b>truss</b> bridge's deflection calculation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Steel</b> <b>truss</b> {{coupling}} beam is a {{new type}} of steel coupling beam structure. To investigate seismic behavior of this coupling beam, low cyclic loading tests for four full-scale specimens of <b>steel</b> <b>truss</b> coupling beam are presented. The specimens are designed considering three factors which are T-stub steel, angle steel and material strength. The experimental data show that <b>steel</b> <b>truss</b> coupling beam has good ductility, and can consume a great quantity of earthquake energy. By enlarging the sections of cross abdominal trusses and chord members, bearing capacity and stiffness of the whole coupling beam are greatly increased...|$|R

500|$|The current {{terminal}} building {{was designed by}} the Charlotte based architectural firm of Odell Associates and was built {{to serve as a}} replacement for the 1953 terminal, later demolished in 2005. Construction of the terminal commenced in 1987, and it opened in October 1989 at a final cost of $25 million. The Y-shaped building features a front of blue-tinted, reflecting glass with exposed white triangular tube <b>steel</b> <b>trusses.</b> The lobby interior includes an arched brick wall leading out into a central plaza and front courtyard at the main entrance. The terminal was constructed to handle passengers expected through the year 2010, with a design that allows for expansion when warranted.

500|$|SeaTac/Airport station {{consists}} of a single island platform elevated , connected to a mezzanine level {{by a series of}} escalators and elevators. The station was designed by the architectural firm of David Hewitt and emphasizes a theme of flight. The roof features a series of <b>steel</b> <b>trusses,</b> similar in design to Tukwila International Boulevard station, that cover the platform and leave it unobstructed by support columns. At the mezzanine level are ticket vending machines, seating, public restrooms, a flight information screen, and a Smarte Carte dispenser for luggage carts. The mezzanine has connections to two pedestrian bridges: the west bridge connects to the fourth level of the airport parking garage, where a [...] covered walkway leads to the main terminal; the east bridge crosses the Airport Expressway and leads to a plaza on International Boulevard with public art, a kiss and ride and a bus station.

2500|$|One ambitious {{project that}} was never {{completed}} was the Lexington Sky Bridge Plaza. Proposed on October 11, 1984, it never progressed further than the design phases. Envisioned by two University of Kentucky professors, the civic space would have been located [...] above the Harrison Avenue viaduct (now Martin Luther King Drive), and would have included a bandstand for live music, an outdoor cafe with meeting space, and a display area for local art scene. It would have included provisions for an ice-skating rink. The facility would have been constructed on four concrete piers that extend upward from the existing viaduct with two <b>steel</b> <b>trusses</b> and concrete brace supports. It was loosely modeled after the Belvedere along Interstate 64 in Louisville, Kentucky and Fountain Square in Cincinnati, Ohio.|$|E
2500|$|Starting in 1943, the {{pedestrian}} walkways {{were removed from}} the bridge allowing for vehicular traffic expansion by the creation of two more vehicular lanes. The project's primary goal was to reinforce the bridge with trusses after the Tacoma Narrows Bridge disaster. The four lanes of roadway traffic were widened to six lanes and [...] high <b>steel</b> <b>trusses</b> were installed {{on both sides of the}} deck to weigh down and stiffen the bridge in an effort to reduce oscillation. These trusses detracted from the former streamlined looking span. In 2003, the Metropolitan Transit Authority restored the classic lines of the bridge by removing the stiffening trusses and installing fiberglass fairing along both sides of the road deck. The lightweight fiberglass fairing is triangular in shape giving it an aerodynamic profile [...] "that slices the wind as it passes over the bridge". The removal of the trusses and other changes to the decking cut the bridge's weight by 6,000 tons, some 25% of the mass suspended by the cables.|$|E
2500|$|The area {{along the}} wall of the {{building}} from the eastern side has a narrow corridor flanked by [...] "lockers" [...] (small rooms with racks). The corridor wall is vertical beaded board, the floors are patched concrete and the outer wall is concrete. The building appears to have been built in two stages, the eastern section has timber trusses and timber frames to the tethering area and looks older than the western end which has <b>steel</b> <b>trusses</b> and partition frames. The tethering area consists of low walls running parallel {{along the length of the}} building, equipped with steel rings for tethering animals and hay racks for them above. When the place is occupied, rails are erected to separate each bay and sawdust and sand bedding is put down. Around most of the perimeter of the building are very basic sleeping quarters for people showing their animals at Ekka. There are a few animal pens under the women's sleeping quarters in the western section. These are for cows in calf or with new calves. In the northwest corner of the building is a room for preparing food used by those sleeping in the building. The building has a later brick extension.|$|E
