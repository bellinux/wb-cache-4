WVN effectiveness can be augmented when coupled with a network of low-power, low-cost Pyroelectric InfraRed (PIR) detectors to form a multimodal surveillance system. Autonomy is a key issue as battery replacement is often impractical and even using energy scavenging techniques, such as <b>solar</b> <b>harvester,</b> ad-hoc power management policies are essential to extend network lifetime. In this {{paper we propose a}} cooperative policy to manage power consumption of a WVN powered by solar scavengers and supported by a network of PIR sensors that perform a coarse classification of movements. A cost function is calculated by each VSN according to its available energy and information from the PIR network. Such functions are used by a distributed energy aware policy that selects the best VSN to observe the activity. This VSN locally analyzes the image and detects whether or not it represents a person, and only this information is forwarded to users. The effectiveness of this technique is evaluated through simulation and compared to an approach presented in previous work.

Standard DSSCs use a liquid electrolyte, which leads to relevant technological drawbacks associated with poor long-term stability, difficulty in robust and hermetic sealing, electrolyte evaporation/leakage. In this context, a very promising and common skill used to solve these problems is the attempt to replace the liquid electrolyte with a quasi-solid or solid electrolyte. We report on the preparation and characterization of novel polymer electrolyte membranes for quasi-solid DSSCs. New methacrylic-acrylic gel-polymer electrolytes were prepared by photo-polymerization of multifunctional monomers. The crosslinked films were self-standing, transparent and flexible.

Several criteria have to be fulfilled in the optimization of the morphology of the nanostructured material for an efficient light capturing and charge transport at the photoelectrode. The exposed surface for dye sensitization plays a crucial role, since the planar dimension of the dye molecule is significantly higher than its optical cross section and a great number of light capturing centers are necessary to generate a high number of carriers. The electrons injected on the conduction band of the wide band gap semiconductor have to draw a tortuous path when moving on a random assembly of nanoparticles and the possibility to have a direct pathway for the photogenerated charges can reduce significantly the electron recombination. 1 D or quasi 1 D nanostructures can guarantee a fast and direct charge transport, but usually pay a lot in terms of surface area, being it significantly lower than in nanocrystalline network. Thus, material with a 3 D branched nanomorphology with size and spacing on the order of the exciton diffusion length could represent the equilibrium point between the different requirements. In this presentation we give an overview on the application of different metal oxide nanostructures (e. g. TiO 2 nanotubes and spongelike ZnO) in the fabrication of efficient DSC photoanodes. TiO 2 nanotubes produced by anodic oxidation of Ti foil probably represent the most interesting quasi 1 D nanostructure for application in DSC photoanodes.

However, computer vision typically requires notable amounts of computing performance, a considerable memory foot-print and high power consumption. Thus, wireless smart cameras pose a challenge to current hardware capabilities in terms of low-power consumption and high imaging performance. For this reason, wireless surveillance systems still require considerable amount of research in different areas such as mote architec-tures, video processing algorithms, power management, energy harvesting and distributed engine.

Nowadays, renewable energy already occupies a bigger share of the world's energy demand pie, and still keeps growing. Mechanical and solar energy are ubiquitous in our daily life. In this work, we focus on studying the use of Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) as a component in the mechanical and <b>solar</b> energy <b>harvester.</b> PVDF has attracted extensive interest for decades due to its unique piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties, high chemical and thermal stability. In addition, PVDF is intrinsically an organic, which allows it to be fabricated by low-cost methods and engineered to be PVDF thin film or PVDF based nanofiber. Recent works have shown considerable attention towards self-powered energy source by scavenging energy from ambient environments. The integration of energy harvesting and energy storage device is a way that not only enables to convert ambient energy into electricity but also provides sustainable power source for various electronic devices and systems. It is highly desirable to improve the integration level and minimize unnecessary energy loss in the power-management circuits between energy harvesting and storage devices. In our study, we fabricated a device composed of supercapacitor and piezoelectric nanogenerator. PVDF thin film membrane was integrated as a component both the separator and the energy harvester in a supercapacitor to form a rectification-free devices for one-step energy conversion and storage. In this device, externally mechanical impact establishes a piezoelectric potential across the PVDF film, {{which serves as a}} driving force for the migration of ions towards the interface of functionalized carbon cloth electrodes and stores the electricity in the form of electrochemical energy. Transparent electrode is an indispensable component for solar cell. The thin and flexible transparent electrodes with excellent conductivity and good transmittance are highly desirable in industry.

This will result in increased air pollution. Carbon dioxide emissions have been linked to global warming and other pollution related problems. These emissions can be reduced by recapturing the waste energy in the form of heat, vibration, and friction. Common applications like transportation can lose as much as 78 % of the energy they generate. Energy harvesters can be used to recapture energy lost through vibration, heat, etc. This recaptured energy will be reused and hence, we don’t need to produce as much energy using traditional methods. Equipment with low power needs such as sensors can use this recaptured energy and hence, the need for external battery or energy source will be minimized. This investigation will focus on the effects of chemical composition on the electromechanical properties of the gel beads. Electrostatic energy harvesters consist of a proof mass that translates or deforms relative to an electrode array. When an electrical field is applied, this causes a change in capacitance which drives a current through a load resistance to generate power. Ionic liquid polymers have been used in dye-sensitized <b>solar</b> cell energy <b>harvesters.</b> This work will examine whether the flexibility offered by Polymeric Ionic liquid (PIL) gel beads could be leveraged in other energy harvesting devices. To that end, this investigation works to examine the effect of the chemical composition of PIL beads on electromechanical properties. This will be accomplished using: 1.
