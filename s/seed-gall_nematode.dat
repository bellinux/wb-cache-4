40|$|Plant {{parasitic}} nematodes {{are difficult}} to identify because different species are morphologically similar, and this makes their control more difficult. The aim of this work {{was to develop a}} rapid, simple method to identify plant parasitic nemal:odes, based on analysis of protein profiles of nematodes generated by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS). Two methods have been used: grinding and direct analysis of intact nematodes. Both methods were standardised using the nematode Anguina tritici (wheat <b>seed-gall</b> <b>nematode)</b> as a model. Development of the approach involved optimisation of experimental parameters to generate reproducible diagnostic protein profiles for plant parasitic nematodes. With Î±-cyano- 4 -hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) as the matrix, the most effective solvent extraction was with 90 % acetone. With sinapinic acid (SA) as matrix, 90 % ethanol was most effective. When intact nematodes were analysed directly by mixing with the matrix solution, 40 min extraction with CHCA matrix solution generated the best protein profiles. The standardised methods were applied to analyse the seed-gall nematodes A. tritici and A. funesta and to the root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne javanica, which infects many horticultural crops. Typical protein profiles and diagnostic peaks were identified for these nematode species and for mixtures of Anguina species. The results provide 'proof-of-concept' that these nematode species can be identified by protein profiling using MALDI-TOFMS. This new approach could be extended to identify other plant and non-plant parasitic nematodes...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{accurately}} identify nematodes at the species level requires specific skills in nematode taxonomy. The most common approach used is microscopy, which {{takes time and}} requires specific training: molecular approaches to plant nematode identification can also be used. Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is {{being used as a}} new approach to identify microorganisms. Identification is based on the characteristic protein profile of the organism generated by MALDI-TOF MS. In MALDI-TOF MS, pulses from a UV laser are absorbed by a crystalline matrix to which macromolecules have been adsorbed, and this results in relatively gentle desorption and ionization of the macromolecules, which are then accelerated using a high voltage and travel along the flight tube. The time taken to reach the detector {{is directly related to the}} mass/charge ratio of the molecule. MALDI-TOF is a promising approach for rapid identification of organisms because of the simple sample preparation and the rapidity of the technique.

The results provide proof-of-concept that these nematode species can be identified by protein profiling using MALDI-TOF MS.
