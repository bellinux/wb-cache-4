40|$|In its {{intervention}} at the 10 th {{session of}} the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues 2010, the World Indigenous Network Higher Education Consortium (WINHEC) acknowledged that despite a history of protracted but limited attempts by Governments globally to address the low participation and graduation rates of Indigenous peoples from higher education at post graduate level, this {{continues to be an}} area of considerable concern. This paper speaks to the development of an innovative academic process that profiles the ground breaking work of WINHEC and a cohort of Indigenous academics in developing academic programs designed to address this systemic failure. The concept of these programs was endorsed in 2006 at a WINHEC conference where Indigenous representatives from across the world met to discuss in part, historical and contempory impediments to Indigenous success within higher education. The goal of WINHEC has been to develop a nested <b>suite</b> <b>of</b> inventive postgraduate awards founded within the scholarship of Indigenous Knowledge which encapsulates an epistemological approach. This has been a ground breaking process that has included collaborative and intellectual contributions of Indigenous academics from diverse cultural nations across the globe and, in particular, Australia. In 2012 the culmination of this dream and the <b>suite</b> <b>of</b> courses developed, <b>honours</b> and embrace the uniqueness of Indigenous Knowledge and the cultural integrity of Indigenous Leadership...|$|R

A <b>suite</b> <b>of</b> models, relating to Health Care is used as an example.

With this background, we go on to discuss a methodology for developing <b>suites</b> <b>of</b> simulation models and cloud-based technology for storing and sharing such models in a marketplace of models. Finally, we discuss future research and developments needed to bring the marketplace into common use by modeling and simulation practitioners...|$|R
