25|$|Penny Sparrow is {{one such}} {{high-profile}} case. She posted the following through her Facebook account:These monkeys that are allowed to be released on New Year’s eve and New Year’s day on to public beaches towns etc obviously have no education what so ever so to allow them loose is inviting huge dirt and troubles and discomfort to others. I’m sorry to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> among the revellers and all I saw were black on black skins what a shame. I do know some wonderful and thoughtful black people. This lot of monkeys just don’t want to even try. But think they can voice opinions about statute and get their way oh dear. From now I shall address the blacks of South Africa as monkeys as I see the cute little wild monkeys do the same, pick drop and litter.|$|E
500|$|In 1960 Leigh {{recalled}} her ambivalence {{towards her}} first experience of critical acclaim and sudden fame, commenting, [...] "that some critics saw {{fit to be}} as foolish as to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a great actress. And I thought, that was a foolish, wicked thing to say, because it put such an onus and such a responsibility onto me, which I simply wasn't able to carry. And it took me years to learn enough to live up to what they said for those first notices. I find it so stupid. I remember the critic very well and have never forgiven him." ...|$|E

[...] "I will <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> proud of the material, but maybe it's not the best version of Diamond Rio," [...] Olander told the publication. [...] "We were kind of in a no-man's land. We didn't fit in with country radio and we didn't fit with Christian radio. It was something that wasn't fully realized." [...] The band began releasing records independently, starting with a live album in 2014 and following in 2015 with the studio album I Made It.|$|E

500|$|National media {{attention}} inadvertently turned to Musial {{a month before}} the 1952 season began, after Ty Cobb wrote an article regarding modern baseball players that was published in Life magazine. Cobb singled out Musial and Phil Rizzuto as the only players [...] "who can be mentioned in the same breath with the oldtime greats". Cobb went on to refer to Musial as [...] "a better player than Joe DiMaggio was in his prime." [...] In response, Musial displayed his characteristic modesty, saying, [...] "Cobb is baseball's greatest. I don't want to contradict him, but I can't <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ever as good as Joe DiMaggio." ...|$|E
500|$|Eckhart {{has talked}} {{much about his}} beliefs, his way of life, and his future career ambitions. Talking to Entertainment Weekly {{regarding}} his Mormon faith, he revealed, [...] "I'm sure people think I'm a Mormon, but I don't know that I'm a Mormon anymore, you know? To be honest, to be perfectly clear, I'd be a hypocrite if I did <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> just because I haven't lived that lifestyle for so many years." [...] In other interviews, {{he has said that}} hypnosis helped him to quit drinking, smoking, and partying, and that he undertakes amateur photography in his spare time. In an interview with Parade magazine, Eckhart revealed that before he discovered acting, he wanted to become a songwriter.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert, of the Chicago Sun-Times, {{gave the}} film 3 out of 4 stars, writing [...] "There {{is hardly a}} thing I can say in its favor, except that I was cheered by nearly every minute of it. I cannot argue for the script, the direction, the acting or even the mummy, but I can <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not bored and {{sometimes}} I was unreasonably pleased." [...] Likewise, Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B−" [...] grade and said, [...] "The Mummy {{would like to make}} you shudder, but it tries to do so without ever letting go of its jocular inconsequentiality." [...] Bob Graham of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film high marks for the acting as well as the special effects.|$|E

500|$|Simpson {{described}} {{the process of}} writing the album's twelve songs as being similar to keeping a diary, and before the album's US release she said that [...] "My inspiration came from what I have gone through in the past three years. Every single day I was thinking of what I was going through and would write songs about it." [...] The lyrics primarily deal with love and heartbreak; in particular, much of the album's lyrical content was inspired by Simpson's breakup with her boyfriend at the time, Josh Henderson. She has {{described the}} album as being [...] "very honest" [...] and [...] "very true to my emotions"—"I wasn't afraid to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> hurting and how I got over it." [...] Simpson worked closely with a number of experienced songwriters on the album. The album's producer, John Shanks—who won a Grammy in February 2005, in part for his work as producer on Autobiography—receives songwriting credit alongside Simpson on all but two songs. Kara DioGuardi also receives songwriting credit, together with Simpson and Shanks, on seven of the songs, including the three singles. (See the track listing.) ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{of the two}} quotes {{appearing}} on the Stone of Hope and attributed to King, [...] "I was a drum major for justice, peace and righteousness", is a paraphrased version of King's actual words, which were: [...] "If you want to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a drum major, <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a drum major for justice. <b>Say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a drum major for peace. I was a drum major for righteousness. And {{all of the other}} shallow things will not matter." [...] The Washington Posts Rachel Manteuffel noticed the change and publicized it in an August 25, 2011 column, arguing that the revised quote misrepresented both King himself and the meaning of the 1968 sermon from which it was taken, in which King imagined the sort of eulogy he might receive.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the fourteen quotations on the Inscription Wall, {{each side of the}} Stone of Hope includes an additional statement attributed to King. The first, from the [...] "I Have a Dream" [...] speech, is [...] "Out of the Mountain of Despair, a Stone of Hope"—the quotation that serves {{as the basis for the}} monument's design. The words on the other side of the stone used to read, [...] "I Was a Drum Major for Justice, Peace, and Righteousness", which is a paraphrased version of a longer quote by King: [...] "If you want to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a drum major, <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a drum major for justice. <b>Say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a drum major for peace. I was a drum major for righteousness. And all of the other shallow things will not matter." [...] The memorial's use of the paraphrased version of the quote was criticized, and was removed in August 2013.|$|E

2500|$|Political {{messages}} were also occasionally {{displayed in the}} backgrounds of scenes, as graffiti or fluttering newspapers displaying politically charged headlines which alluded to social problems, such as white collar crime, and homelessness. For his part, Norm Breyfogle believed that his role in producing the comic was merely that of artist, and so felt that his contribution to the comic's themes were minimal. Of them he expressed, [...] "(The series) was quite obviously subversive. But as an artist I was just drawing Alan’s stories. I wouldn’t <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> being particularly subversive, although I was a bit when I put graffiti on the walls in the backgrounds.|$|E

In a 1995 interview, she explained her motivation for some explicit scenes in Embrace of the Vampire: [...] "I'm not going to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> manipulated into doing things that I didn't want to do. I did {{it because it was}} a woman director and I felt protected. And I learned a lot as far as knowing where the camera is and what coverage they need so that it's not all explicit." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to {{journalist}} Alan Nairn, Blair disobeyed {{orders from}} {{civilians in the}} Clinton administration during the 1999 East Timorese crisis during his tenure as commander-in-chief of the U.S. Pacific Command. Amid growing international concern over violence against the independence movement in Indonesian-occupied East Timor, Blair was ordered to meet with General Wiranto, {{the commander of the}} Indonesian military, and to tell him to shut down the pro-Indonesia militia. According to Nairn, two days after the Liquiçá Church Massacre, Blair failed to deliver this message; instead he presented Wiranto with an offer of military assistance and a personal invitation to be Blair's guest in Hawaii. Consequently, Wiranto’s [...] "forces increased the Timor killings". During his confirmation hearing as Director of National Intelligence, Blair responded to the accusations: [...] "In our conversations with leaders of Indonesia, both military and civilian, we decried and said that the torture and killing that was being conducted by paramilitary groups and some military groups in East Timor had to stop"; [...] "those who <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> somehow carrying out my own policy or saying things that were not in accordance with American policy are just flat wrong".|$|E

2500|$|MacMillan was {{commissioned}} {{as a second}} lieutenant into the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in August 1915. Due to him not being 19, he was posted to the 3rd Battalion, Argylls, a training unit, stationed near Edinburgh. In April 1916 {{he was sent to}} the Western Front where he joined the 2nd Battalion (the 93rd), a Regular Army unit which was then serving as part of the 98th Brigade of the 33rd Division, in Northeast France, and immediately became involved in fierce trench warfare at Brickstacks. This was followed by engagements, as part of the battles of the Somme and Passchendaele, at Cuinchy, Bazentin-le-Petit, High Wood, Mametz Wood, Arras, Le Cateau and the Selle. While still only 19 years old and a second lieutenant, he was appointed acting adjutant of the battalion in November 1916. He was promoted to lieutenant in April 1917, and formally confirmed as Adjutant in June. He remained in this post {{for the rest of the}} war, serving seven different commanding officers (CO). The casualties were immense and, at one time, while a second lieutenant, he found himself by default commanding the battalion. MacMillan wrote [...] "I would <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> fortunate to belong to the best battalion in the Army, with an unbreakable spirit. You can see this from the record of their operations – and then look at the casualty list: 63 officers and 1175 men killed, and ready for anything at the end of it all".|$|E
