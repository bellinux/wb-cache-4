5|$|A Markov {{chain is}} a type of Markov process that has either {{discrete}} <b>state</b> <b>space</b> or discrete index set (often representing time), but the precise definition of a Markov chain varies. For example, it is common to define a Markov chain as a Markov process in either discrete or continuous time with a countable <b>state</b> <b>space</b> (thus regardless of the nature of time), but it is also common to define a Markov chain as having discrete time in either countable or continuous <b>state</b> <b>space</b> (thus regardless of the <b>state</b> <b>space).</b>|$|E
5|$|If the <b>state</b> <b>space</b> is the {{integers}} {{or natural}} numbers, then the stochastic process {{is called a}} discrete or integer-valued stochastic process. If the <b>state</b> <b>space</b> is the real line, then the stochastic process {{is referred to as}} a real-valued stochastic process or a process with continuous <b>state</b> <b>space.</b> If the <b>state</b> <b>space</b> is -dimensional Euclidean space, then the stochastic process is called a -dimensional vector process or -vector process.|$|E
5|$|A {{stochastic}} {{process can be}} classified in different ways, for example, by its <b>state</b> <b>space,</b> its index set, or the dependence among the random variables. One common way of classification is by the cardinality of the index set and the <b>state</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E

As a result, three agents could provide the wizard with dialogue strategies varying from an abstract strategy to a precise one. The extraction of <b>state</b> <b>spaces</b> was a result of the breaking down of the attributes derived from the dialogue patterns. However, the attributes could be broken down to more elaborate strategies. This work explores only three <b>state</b> <b>spaces</b> and their resulting strategies.

50|$|The {{approaches}} that embody concepts of systems, multiple elements, multiple relational regimes, and <b>state</b> <b>spaces</b> might {{be summarized as}} implying that complexity arises {{from the number of}} distinguishable relational regimes (and their associated <b>state</b> <b>spaces)</b> in a defined system.|$|R
5|$|A {{classic example}} of a random walk {{is known as the}} simple random walk, which is a {{stochastic}} process in discrete time with the integers as the <b>state</b> <b>space,</b> and is based on a Bernoulli process, where each iid Bernoulli variable takes either the value positive one or negative one. In other words, the simple random walk takes place on the integers, and its value increases by one with probability, say, , or decreases by negative one with probability , so index set of this random walk is the natural numbers, while its <b>state</b> <b>space</b> is the integers. If the , this random walk is called a symmetric random walk.|$|E
5|$|The {{definition}} of separability {{can also be}} stated for other index sets and state spaces, {{such as in the}} case of random fields, where the index set as well as the <b>state</b> <b>space</b> can be -dimensional Euclidean space.|$|E
5|$|A {{stochastic}} or {{random process}} {{can be defined as}} a collection of random variables that is indexed by some mathematical set, meaning that each random variable of the stochastic process is uniquely associated with an element in the set. The set used to index the random variables is called the index set. Historically, the index set was some subset of the real line, such as the natural numbers, giving the index set the interpretation of time. Each random variable in the collection takes values from the same mathematical space known as the <b>state</b> <b>space.</b> This <b>state</b> <b>space</b> can be, for example, the integers, the real line or -dimensional Euclidean space. An increment is the amount that a stochastic process changes between two index values, often interpreted as two points in time. A stochastic process can have many outcomes, due to its randomness, and a single outcome of a stochastic process is called, among other names, a sample function or realization.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} novel frameworkfor {{exploring}} very large <b>state</b> <b>spaces</b> of concurrent reactive systems. Our frameworkexploits application-independent heuristics using genetic algorithms to guide a state-space search towards error states. We have implemented this frameworkin conjunction with VeriSoft, {{a tool for}} exploring the <b>state</b> <b>spaces</b> of software applications composed of several concurrent processes executing arbitrary code. We present experimental results obtained with several examples of programs, including a C implementation of a publickey authentication protocol. We discuss heuristics and properties of <b>state</b> <b>spaces</b> that help a genetic search detect deadlocks and assertion violations. For finding errors in very large <b>state</b> <b>spaces,</b> our experiments show that a genetic search using simple heuristics can significantly outperform random and systematic searches. ...|$|R

5|$|In the mathematically {{rigorous}} {{formulation of}} quantum mechanics, developed by John von Neumann, the possible states (more precisely, the pure states) of a quantum mechanical system {{are represented by}} unit vectors (called state vectors) residing in a complex separable Hilbert space, known as the <b>state</b> <b>space,</b> well defined up to a complex number of norm 1 (the phase factor). In other words, the possible states are points in the projectivization of a Hilbert space, usually called the complex projective space. The exact nature of this Hilbert space {{is dependent on the}} system; for example, the position and momentum states for a single non-relativistic spin zero particle is the space of all square-integrable functions, while the states for the spin of a single proton are unit elements of the two-dimensional complex Hilbert space of spinors. Each observable is represented by a self-adjoint linear operator acting on the <b>state</b> <b>space.</b> Each eigenstate of an observable corresponds to an eigenvector of the operator, and the associated eigenvalue corresponds to the value of the observable in that eigenstate.|$|E

40|$|Noise {{is often}} {{indispensable}} to key cellular activities, such as gene expression, necessitating {{the use of}} stochastic models to capture its dynamics. The chemical master equation (CME) is a commonly used stochastic model of Kolmogorov forward equations that describe how the probability distribution of a chemically reacting system varies with time. Finding analytic solutions to the CME can have benefits, such as expediting simulations of multiscale biochemical reaction networks and aiding the design of distributional responses. However, analytic solutions are rarely known. A recent method of computing analytic stationary solutions relies on gluing simple <b>state</b> <b>spaces</b> together recursively at one or two states. We explore the capabilities of this method and introduce algorithms to derive analytic stationary solutions to the CME. We first formally characterize <b>state</b> <b>spaces</b> that can be constructed by performing single-state gluing of paths, cycles or both sequentially. We then study stochastic biochemical reaction networks that consist of reversible, elementary reactions with two-dimensional <b>state</b> <b>spaces.</b> We also discuss extending the method to infinite <b>state</b> <b>spaces</b> and designing the stationary behaviour of stochastic biochemical reaction networks. Finally, we illustrate the aforementioned ideas using examples that include two interconnected transcriptional components and biochemical reactions with two-dimensional <b>state</b> <b>spaces...</b>|$|R
