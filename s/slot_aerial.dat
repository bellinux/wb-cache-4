40|$|Slot aerials of a georadiolocator, {{numerical}} {{methods for}} the aerial modelling {{have been investigated}} in the paper. As a result it has been shown, that many methods for the numerical solution of an integral equation of "electric field" give the solution distortions. The integro-differential system of "scalar potential" has been formulated. The method for its solution, which {{is equivalent to the}} "rooftop" method, has been considered. The criterion of the distortion absence has been found. Characteristics of a <b>slot</b> <b>aerial</b> have been calculated. Characteristics of a <b>slot</b> <b>aerial</b> of a georadiolocator: the "lower - upper" discrimination, directional patterns, distributions of the energy flow in a ground, the input impedance at various values of dielectric permittivity of a ground, the case of a lifted aerial and an aerial located on a ground, in a wide frequency range - have been calculatedAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|Effective schemes of the Galerkin's method applicationly to the {{solution}} of integral equations for <b>slot</b> <b>aerials</b> and the diffraction of H-polarization have been developed in the paper. Methods for the calculation of main electrodynamic characteristics of <b>slot</b> <b>aerials</b> have been elaborated as well as programs for the calculation of these characteristics. The paper results have been introduced into operation. The base for the more exact and quick calculation and design of <b>slot</b> <b>aerials</b> has been createdAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R

Booker published <b>Slot</b> <b>Aerials</b> and Their Relation to Complementary Wire Aerials to extend Babinet's principle to account for polarization (otherwise known as Booker's Extension). This information is drawn from, as stated above, Balanis's third edition Antenna Theory textbook.|$|R

Its hardware features were also showcased, with its SIM card <b>slot</b> and <b>aerial,</b> its ability to boot AmigaOS from SD card. In September 2011, Acube Systems introduced AmigaOne 500 based on Sam460ex mainboard.|$|R
40|$|This article {{deals with}} a simple method to produce photomaps of as yet unsurveyed areas. Since a {{triangulation}} network or a topographic inventory of the areas to be mapped did not exist, it was considered most suitable to produce some kind of «preliminary maps»: Maps of medium accuracy but high content of information which could be produced {{within a short time}} with modest technical means and at low cost. The following procedure was found to be most suitable for that purpose. A network of control points is established by means of the <b>slotted</b> templet method. <b>Aerial</b> photographs,dodged by the Log Etronic procedure, are assembled to semicontrolled mosaics. Grestlines, plateau edges and Symbols for mountain peaks, passes etc. as well as spot heights, roads, tracks, wells, market places and names of Settlements, districts and surface features are introduced into the photomosaics by means of transparent overlays. This latter Information was collected during a three months' field survey in the Yemen Arab Republic...|$|R
