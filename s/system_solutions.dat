The {{facility}} was 3 million square feet and included manufacturing, laboratories, offices, and a Munson road test course. It designed developed and produced the Air Defense Systems that replaced the Semi Automatic Defense Ground Environment (SAGE) in the United States with the Joint Surveillance System (JSS) AN/FYQ-93 including NORAD with Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) and provided defense systems and air traffic control systems around the world. These systems are massive and at its peak Ground Systems Group employed 15,000 people and generated revenue in excess of $1 billion per year. They were the largest revenue producer and with its massive systems engineering division coordinated the inclusion of products and systems from other Hughes Groups into the large <b>system</b> <b>solutions.</b>|$|E

This increase was offset by a decline in North America <b>system</b> <b>solutions</b> revenue of $41.2 million. The increase in International <b>System</b> <b>Solutions</b> net revenues was largely attributable to growth in the Latin American market, primarily Brazil as several of Verifone's largest Brazilian customers made public offerings that generated money to purchase electronic payment products, as well as higher demand for prepaid top-ups, medical and health care <b>System</b> <b>Solutions.</b> Furthermore, European net revenues for <b>System</b> <b>Solutions</b> increased by $19.4 million due to improved supply chain and sales execution in Russia and Ukraine. The decrease in North America <b>System</b> <b>Solutions</b> net revenues was primarily attributable to weakening demand for the firm's [...] "Petroleum Solutions" [...] and a reduction in demand from United States financial businesses.|$|E

The ASMGJ method has been implemented as the <b>system</b> <b>solution</b> procedure in PARFES, a Parallel Finite Element System, which can be used on message-passing MIMD parallel computers for the linear static analysis of structures by the FE method.
