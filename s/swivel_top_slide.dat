40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the present}} study {{in view of the}} latest {{development}} and revolutionary changes taking place in CNC field through the world, Mechanical elements have to be designed and manufactured to precision, which is perfectly and easily possible through these modern CNC machines. This work is based on the capacity and capability of vertical machining Centre (VTC) with auto tool changer. The <b>top</b> <b>slide</b> which was part programmed can be machined using VTC. And Machining Time is compared in between carbide and hardened tools. The “Top slide ” of lathe’s called for powerful NC programming technique were used absolute position type data input system using G codes, M codes, polar coordinate programs, circular and linear interpolation, canned cycles etc. The above mentioned component – <b>top</b> <b>slide</b> being manufactured by using various Conventional machine tools like horizontal milling, vertical milling, surface grinding, boring machine and slotting machines. This involved a considerable lead time and usually delayed the assembly schedule. it has been modified and adopted for regular production on this machine, in two setups there by boosting their productivity and ensuring quality in each and every piece. Finally, we can establish for regular production...|$|R
50|$|Artifacts {{recovered}} from the wreck include an olivewood box {{in the shape of}} a heart or leaf and with a <b>swivel</b> <b>top</b> and a pair of violin-shaped boxes. All were probably used for cosmetics or jewelry. Also found were a collection of woodworking tools, a large number of treenails and tenons, plus a whetstone. Seventy pottery vessels, many of them complete, were found in the wreck. These include jugs, plates, lamps, a cooking pot, a water jar, several storage jars, decorated amphorae, miniature juglets and black glazed ware. Most are attributed to Cyprus, but some may have originated in Greece or the Palestinian coast. Also located among the wreck were remnants of food, including grape, fig, olive and barley. These appear to originate in the eastern Mediterranean, most likely southwest Turkey and adjacent islands, and indicate that the boat sank during the summer. Other organic material includes a woven basket and a large amount of rope. The copper nails used in construction of the ship were revealed to be made of copper mined in northwest Cyprus.|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the Panoramas, a more basic series of models was offered, with windows of similar size, but with simpler trim and <b>top</b> <b>sliding</b> vent windows instead of forced air vents. Initially these were built on Bedford and Ford chassis only and named variously as Val, Vam (on the new Bedford VAM chassis) or Embassy IV. However, when the Panorama was renamed Panorama I for the 1967 season, the less expensive [...] "bread and butter" [...] models became available on all chassis types as the Panorama II. The Panorama I in particular sold extremely well.|$|R
50|$|Open Slide Design. The {{primary role}} of the open-top slide {{was to provide a}} 180° {{ejection}} port. Open <b>top</b> <b>slide</b> virtually eliminated jamming or stovepiping. The slide retention device, which caused the slide and barrel assembly to remain open after the last cartridge had been fired and ejected, allowed the user to load the chamber one cartridge at a time (emergency tactical loading) should the magazine be lost or damaged. The pistols were designed so that the extractor would not be damaged by direct chamber loading. These models operated on the short recoil, delayed locking block system, which yielded a faster cycle time.|$|R
50|$|The {{compound}} rest (or <b>top</b> <b>slide)</b> (2) is usually where {{the tool post}} is mounted. It provides a smaller amount of movement (less than the cross-slide) along its axis via another feedscrew. The {{compound rest}} axis can be adjusted independently of the carriage or cross-slide. It is used for turning tapers, to control depth of cut when screwcutting or precision facing, or to obtain finer feeds (under manual control) than the feed shaft permits. Usually, the compound rest has a protractor marked in its base (2b), enabling the operator to adjust its axis to precise angles.|$|R

50|$|The V70 uses {{a slider}} form factor, where the user can push on a plastic bar located under {{the screen in}} order to open the <b>sliding</b> <b>top</b> portion of the phone. When opened, the <b>top</b> portion <b>slides</b> upwards, {{revealing}} the standard bell keypad (including numeric, star, and pound keys). These keys are covered when the phone is closed, but the remaining keys, including the side keys, can be used normally once the keypad is unlocked; such keys are automatically locked after the device is closed to prevent accidental activation when in a purse or pocket.|$|R
50|$|Players may steal a money stack {{from any}} player {{if they have}} a card that adds up to $100 when added to the top card of that stack. After placing the card on <b>top,</b> players <b>slide</b> the whole stack to their side of the table.|$|R
50|$|Although {{externally}} {{very similar}} to the preceding Z1 and Z2-class trams they had significant design differences, and were a significant improvement on the Z1 and Z2-class trams. They are fitted with AEG control equipment and Duewag bogies, have an additional door each side (for a total of three rather than two for the Z1 and Z2), drop down (as opposed to <b>top</b> <b>sliding)</b> Beclawat windows and improved headlights. The unreliable flap type destination displays and route number indicators were replaced by rollable plastic film destination displays. They also had much smoother acceleration and braking performance, and improved suspension. The Z3-class build process went smoothly, with few problems, bar a slow delivery of equipment from AEG, and a few minor faults that required remedying after construction.|$|R
50|$|In {{the formal}} {{living and dining}} rooms {{decorative}} features include picture rails, metal and glass pendant light fittings and an early chair and silk floor rug. A pair of early sliding leadlight doors separates these rooms. The leadlight pattern described above is carried through in the french doors opening into the eastern enclosed verandah; however leadlight casements opening {{from the dining room}} into this space and the rear informal living area are of a different design. The servery door from the kitchen is split horizontally into two sections: the <b>top</b> <b>slides</b> up into a wall cavity while the bottom swings open on a hinge. The top leaf of the door has a leadlight panel with a similar pattern to the other dining room windows.|$|R
5000|$|Playground slides {{are found}} in parks, schools, playgrounds and backyards. The slide may be flat, or half {{cylindrical}} or tubular to prevent falls.

The user, typically a child, climbs to the <b>top</b> of the <b>slide</b> via a ladder or stairs and sits down on the <b>top</b> of the <b>slide</b> and slides down the chute.|$|R

30|$|The arm can rotate {{and move}} a gripper, {{attached}} to the robot base, along the vertical axis. The rotation of the gripper occurs around the vertical axis. We adopt a multi-step vertical movement mechanism. Fig.  4 a shows {{an overview of the}} multi-step up–down mechanism. By connecting the five-step slide rails with the chains and the sprockets, all of the slide rails are driven relative to the movement of the top rail. The rotary motion of the servo motor is transformed to linear motion by the ball screw allowing the <b>top</b> <b>slide</b> rail to move {{up and down in the}} vertical direction. This mechanism is based on the extension mechanism of a ladder truck. Fig.  4 b, c show the installation of the multi-step up–down mechanism in the actual process. When the vertical component is contracted, all parts are held above the worker, which prevents collisions with the worker and ensures the worker’s safety.|$|R
5000|$|The Tyer's no. 7 tablet {{instrument}} {{consists of}} a wooden case, on top {{of which is a}} metal slide, a switch plunger, a bell plunger and an electric current indicator. On the front is an indicator which may show either of three indications: [...] "Line Closed"; [...] "Train Approaching" [...] and [...] "Train on Line". Below this there is a second slide, which has three positions: fully home, withdrawn half way, and fully withdrawn. The three indications correspond to the three positions of the slide. The case contains several tablets; they are removed from the instrument using the bottom slide, and replaced using the <b>top</b> <b>slide.</b> The instrument was so constructed that if a tablet had been withdrawn from either instrument of a pair, no further tablets could be withdrawn until the withdrawn tablet had been placed either in the other instrument, or in the same instrument from which it had been withdrawn.|$|R
