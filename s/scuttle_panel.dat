50|$|The Roadster (designated OTS - Open Two Seater - in America) had a light {{canvas top}} that folded {{out of sight}} behind the seats. The {{interior}} was trimmed in leather and leatherette, including the dash. Like the XK120 Roadster, the XK140 version had removable canvas and plastic side curtains on light alloy barchetta-type doors, and a tonneau cover. The door tops and <b>scuttle</b> <b>panel</b> were cut back by two inches (50mm) compared to the XK120, to allow a more modern positioning of the steering wheel. The angle of the front face of the doors (A-Post) was changed from 45 degrees to 90 degrees, to make access easier.|$|E
50|$|The MGB {{initially}} had {{an extremely}} simple electrical system. Dash-mounted toggle switches controlled the lights, ventilation fan, and wipers {{with only the}} direction indicators being mounted on a stalk on the steering column. The ignition switch was also mounted on the dash. Like the MGA, the MGB utilized two 6-volt batteries wired in series to give a 12-volt positive earth configuration. The batteries were placed under a <b>scuttle</b> <b>panel</b> behind the seats making access difficult; the location gave excellent weight distribution and thus improved handling. The charging system used a Lucas dynamo. Later MGBs had considerable changes to the electrical system {{including the use of}} a single 12-volt battery, a change from positive to negative earth, safety-type toggle (rocker) switches, alternator in lieu of dynamo, additional warning lights and buzzers, and most common functions moved to steering column stalks.|$|E
50|$|The overall {{profile and}} {{architecture}} of the CA changed little during the vehicle's seventeen-year life. There were, however, three distinctly different versions sold. The first CAs featured a two-piece windscreen, comprising two separate flat sheets of glass separated with a central vertical metal divide. As curved screen glass became available in the UK at an acceptable price, the two piece windscreen was replaced with a single slightly curved windscreen in approximately 1958. At {{the same time the}} painted front grille of the original, which had featured a central split reflecting the split windscreen, was replaced by a smaller unsplit front grille, still painted in the van's body colour. The third version of the Bedford CA, sold from late 1964, featured a much deeper windscreen and side windows, and a corresponding reduction in the height of the painted metal <b>scuttle</b> <b>panel</b> directly below the windscreen. The 1964 vans also reflected general trends in car design of the time in featuring, for the first time, a pressed aluminium alloy front grille. The longer wheelbase version had the body lengthened by an additional short roof panel, with wider doors.|$|E
50|$|Gordon England {{took four}} years to develop his own {{construction}} technique using a solid plywood shell without Weymann's skeletal frame. His seats, and floorboards were mounted directly onto the chassis as was the <b>scuttle</b> and instrument <b>panel.</b> The body was given a hollow box-girder of plywood around its base and attached to the frame at three points. This way the body on its three separate mounting points was able to maintain its shape even over rough roads.|$|R
5000|$|Released in 1961 as more luxurious {{versions}} of the Mini, both the Wolseley Hornet and the Riley Elf had longer, slightly finned rear wings and larger boots that gave the cars a more traditional three-box design.Wheelbase of the Elf and Hornet remained at 2.036 m, whereas the overall length was increased to 3.27 m. This resulted in a dry weight of 638 kg/642.3 kg (rubber/hydrolastic suspension) for the Elf and 618 kg/636.4 kg for the Hornet.Front-end treatment, which incorporated each marque's traditional upright grille design (the Hornet's grille with a lit [...] "Wolseley" [...] badge), also contributed to a less utilitarian appearance. The cars had larger-diameter chrome hubcaps than the Austin and Morris Minis, and additional chrome accents, bumper overriders and wood-veneer dashboards. The Riley was the more expensive of the two cars. [...] The name [...] "Wolseley Hornet" [...] was first used on 1930s saloon, coup√©, sports and racing cars, while the name [...] "Elf" [...] recalled the Riley Sprite and Imp sports cars, also of the 1930s (Riley's first choice of name [...] "Imp" [...] {{could not be used}} as Hillman had registered it). The full-width dashboard was a differentiator between the Elf and Hornet. This dashboard was the idea of Christopher Milner the Sales Manager for Riley.Both the Riley Elf's and Wolseley Hornet's bodies were built at Fisher & Ludlow under their [...] "Fisholow" [...] brandname. Plates in the engine compartment on the right side fitch plate bear evidence of this speciality.Very early Mark I {{versions of}} both cars (e.g. press photo of 445MWL) had no overriders on the bumpers and a single piece front wing (A-panel and wing in one piece, no outside seam below <b>scuttle</b> <b>panel)</b> that was soon given up again, allegedly due to cost. The Elf's and Hornet's special bumper overriders first appeared in 1962.Early production Mark I's also had a combination of leather and cloth seats (Elf R-A2S1-101 to FR2333, Hornet W-A2S1-101 to FW2105) whereas all later models had full leather seats. [...] Mark I models were equipped with single leading shoe brakes on the front.|$|E
