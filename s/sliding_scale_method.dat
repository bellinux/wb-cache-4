50|$|Distributors {{typically}} {{enter into}} one of the two types of film booking contracts. The most common is the aggregate deal where total box office revenue that a given film generates is split by a pre-determined mutually-agreed percentage between distributor and movie theater. The other method is the sliding scale deal, where the percentage of box office revenue taken by theaters declines each week of a given film's run. The sliding scale actually has two pieces that starts with a minimum amount of money that theater is to keep—often called “the house nut”—after which the sliding scale kicks in for revenue generated above the house nut. However, this <b>sliding</b> <b>scale</b> <b>method</b> is falling out of use. Whatever the method, box office revenue is usually shared roughly 50/50 between film distributors and theaters.|$|E

50|$|The <b>sliding</b> <b>scale</b> or {{randomizing}} <b>method</b> can {{be employed}} to greatly improve the linearity of any type of ADC, but especially flash and successive approximation types. For any ADC the mapping from input voltage to digital output value {{is not exactly a}} floor or ceiling function as it should be. Under normal conditions, a pulse of a particular amplitude is always converted to a digital value. The problem lies in that the ranges of analog values for the digitized values are not all of the same width, and the differential linearity decreases proportionally with the divergence from the average width. The <b>sliding</b> <b>scale</b> principle uses an averaging effect to overcome this phenomenon. A random, but known analog voltage is added to the sampled input voltage. It is then converted to digital form, and the equivalent digital amount is subtracted, thus restoring it to its original value. The advantage is that the conversion has taken place at a random point. The statistical distribution of the final levels is decided by a weighted average over a region of the range of the ADC. This in turn desensitizes it to the width of any specific level.|$|R

30|$|Methods: The {{study was}} {{approved}} by the Institutional Review Board, and written, informed consent was obtained from all participants. This study included 28 patients underwent elective cardiac surgery with preoperative HbA 1 c[*]>[*] 6.0  %. The management of blood glucose was performed from immediately after admission to the ICU for two research days. The patients were randomly assigned to control blood glucose levels with the STG- 55 group (n[*]=[*] 16) or <b>sliding</b> <b>scale</b> <b>method,</b> SS group (n[*]=[*] 12). The usefulness of blood glucose management defined the incidence of hyperglycemia (blood glucose[*]>[*] 180  mg/dL), hypoglycemia (< 80  mg/dL), and the maximum glycemic variability (maximum blood glucose level minus minimum blood glucose level). The workload of ICU nurses defined the number of blood samplings for the management of blood glucose and the number of calls made to the physician.|$|E

It is found that 82 % of BG levels are within tar gated band for non-diabetes cohort under stochastic targeted (STAR) glycaemic control protocol. However, only 59. 6 % and 70. 6 % BG levels are within targeted band for diabetes cohort for insulin infusion therapy used in HTAA and STAR protocols. Thus, further investigation on blood glucose control protocol for diabetes patients is required to increase the reliability and efficacy of current practice despite of patient safety...|$|E
40|$|Though {{almost no}} postwar union {{contracts}} indexed wage rates to {{prices of the}} employer's products, union agreements linking wage rates to product prices, known as <b>sliding</b> <b>scales,</b> were common in some industries in the United States and Britain from the 1860 s through the 1930 s. This paper explains why <b>sliding</b> <b>scales</b> disappeared after the 1930 s, and examines what practical experience with <b>sliding</b> <b>scales</b> revealed about fundamental constraints on wage indexation. Paradoxically, the history of <b>sliding</b> <b>scales</b> confirms that workers' information about product prices and materials costs is generally imperfect, {{in ways that would}} substantially constrain wage indexation in long-term contracts. <b>Sliding</b> <b>scales</b> were not indexed long-term contracts, but rather devices to forestall costly strikes in the absence of contracts by revealing employers' private information about product demand. In the postwar US, unions and employers failed to link wage rates to product prices because they had gained the ability to enter binding contracts, which could achieve the benefits of preventing strikes without incurring the extra negotiation costs and information problems associated with product-price indexation. I present a model to show how <b>sliding</b> <b>scales</b> could forestall strikes by revealing information, and how the introduction of binding union contracts reduced incentives to link wages to product prices.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Information Technology)) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 2000 Data {{stored on}} disks {{generally}} contain significant redundancy. A mechanism or algorithm that recodes {{the data to}} lessen the data size could possibly double or triple the effective data that could be stored on the media. One mechanism of doing this is by data compression. Many compression algorithms currently exist, but each one has its own advantages as well as disadvantages. The objective of this study', to formulate a new compression algorithm that could be implemented in a real-time mode in any file system. The new compression algorithm should also execute as fast as possible, {{so as not to}} cause a lag in the file systems performance. This study focuses on binary data of any type, whereas previous articles such as (Huftnlan. 1952 : 1098), (Ziv & Lempel, 1977 : 337 : 1978 : 530), (Storer & Szymanski. 1982 : 928) and (Welch, 1984 : 8) have placed particular emphasis on text compression in their discussions of compression algorithms for computer data. The resulting compression algorithm that is formulated by this study is Lempel-Ziv-Toutlc (LZT). LZT is basically an LZ 77 (Ziv & Lempel, 1977 : 337) encoder with a buffer size equal in size to that of the data block of the file system in question. LZT does not make this distinction, it discards the sliding buffer principle and uses each data block of the entire input stream. as one big buffer on which compression can be performed. LZT also handles the encoding of a match slightly different to that of LZ 77. An LZT match is encoded by two bit streams, the first specifying the position of the match and the other specifying the length of the match. This combination is commonly referred to as a pair. To encode the position portion of the pair, we make use of a <b>sliding</b> <b>scale</b> <b>method.</b> The <b>sliding</b> <b>scale</b> <b>method</b> works as follows. Let the position in the input buffer, of the current character to be compressed be held by inpos, where inpos is initially set to 3. It is then only possible for a match to occur at position 1 or 2. Hence the position of a match will never be greater than 2, and therefore the position portion can be encoded using only 1 bit. As "inpos" is incremented as each character is encoded, the match position range increases and therefore more bits will be required to encode the match position. The reason why a decimal 2 can be encoded 'sing only I bit can be explained as follows. When decimal values are converted to binary values, we get 010 = 02, 110 = 12, 210, = 102 etc. As a position of 0 will never be used, it is possible to develop a coding scheme where a decimal value of 1 can be represented by a binary value of 0, and a decimal value of 2 can be represented by binary value of 1. Only I bit is therefore needed to encode match position I and match position 2. In general. any decimal value n ca:) be represented by the binary equivalent for (n - 1). The number of bits needed to encode (n - 1), indicates the number of bits needed to encode the match position. The length portion of the pair is encoded using a variable length coding (vlc) approach. The vlc method performs its encoding by using binary blocks. The first binary block is 3 bits long, where binary values 000 through 110 represent decimal values I through 7...|$|E

40|$|Sliding scales- {{agreements}} between employers and unions that linked wage rates to product prices- were widespread in some industries, and tried in others, in Britain and the United States from the 1860 s through the 1930 s. I describe how <b>sliding</b> <b>scales</b> worked {{in practice and}} how they were viewed by contemporary employers, unionists and outside observers. I argue that <b>sliding</b> <b>scales</b> were not adopted for the reasons suggested by most theories of wage indexation, but rather {{in order to reduce the}} frequency of strikes in an institutional setting where there was no third-party enforcement of labor agreements. This can explain both the presence of <b>sliding</b> <b>scales</b> in the nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, and the disappearance of <b>sliding</b> <b>scales</b> since the 1930 s. - 1 -Sometime before the year 1841, a British ironmaster named G.

The puddlers received, as a rule, 1 shilling for each pound of the selling price " (Munro, 1889, p. 141). By the 1880 's, arrangements linking wages to product prices were generally referred to as "sliding scales.
