50|$|It was in 1938 {{that the}} Warwick City Council {{proposed}} {{the construction of}} a <b>sewerage</b> treatment <b>works</b> in the northern section of the cemetery. The Council sought Lands permission to divide the cemetery into two land parcels, with the southern part for Cemetery purposes and the northern for its <b>Sewerage</b> Treatment <b>Works.</b> For various controversial reasons, it was not until late 1940 that legislation was passed that vested Warwick City Council as the new Trustees of the cemetery. The Council's <b>sewerage</b> <b>works</b> were completed during the 1940s.|$|R

50|$|A <b>sewerage</b> <b>works</b> for York, {{covering}} about 20 acres, {{was opened}} beside {{the river in}} Naburn in 1895 and has been extended several times. A narrow gauge railway operated at the sewage works and consisted of a short stretch of line and a siding.|$|R

50|$|At {{the opening}} of the East Gordon Street <b>Sewerage</b> <b>Works</b> on 25 January 1936 the {{chairman}} of the Mackay Harbour Board, Charles Frederick Bagley, paid tribute to the city council for its initiative in carrying out the scheme and to the consulting engineer AE Harding Frew who designed it.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s the Warwick City Council {{established}} a council depot for machinery and road making materials {{on part of}} the northern cemetery reserve, between the cemetery and the <b>sewerage</b> <b>works.</b> By 1974 the Cemetery Reserve was being used for three functions: that of Cemetery, <b>Works</b> Depot and <b>Sewerage</b> Treatment <b>Works.</b> Because {{it was necessary to}} gazette the three different uses of this reserve the Deed of Grant upon Trust for the Cemetery was surrendered in 1976 so that Lands could re-survey the land, dedicate roads and issue new Deeds of Grant.|$|R
50|$|At {{the opening}} of the works Bagley reiterated the view of the day that, with the {{completion}} of the <b>sewerage</b> <b>works</b> and the Outer Harbour Scheme, Mackay would become even more important, and the Government Medical Officer, Dr Ernest Wesley Chenoweth, emphasised the public health advantages of the new sewerage scheme.|$|R
50|$|The 1936 <b>Sewerage</b> <b>Works</b> {{is located}} on a level {{allotment}} in East Gordon Street, Mackay.

50|$|As one of {{the first}} <b>sewerage</b> <b>works</b> in {{regional}} Queensland, it is tangible evidence of the importance of Mackay as a regional centre in the 1930s and the influence the city enjoyed through their local Member of Parliament, William Forgan Smith, who was Premier at the time. During the 1920s and 1930s, Mackay was the fastest growing town in Queensland.|$|R

40|$|The {{river mouth}} of Kitagawa Brook is {{normally}} stagnant {{because it is}} easily closed by sand and gravel transported by littoral currents of Biwa Lake, Japan. A new urban area exists in the basin and <b>sewerage</b> <b>works</b> were constructed in the early 1990 s, so contaminated water with a bad odour had flowed into the brook before the <b>sewerage</b> <b>works.</b> To reduce the smell, the river mouth was excavated to narrow the channel in the early 1980 s. Thus, river-bed sediment after this excavation only occurs at the river mouth. From the upper 24 cm of a sediment core, we found 19 strata of leaves which were supplied from deciduous trees in autumn. We also found several gravel layers which were supplied from the lake during severe storms. The combination of veins and gravel layers were reconstructed for about 20 years of sediment records with an error of two to three years...|$|R

5000|$|The beachfront area {{comprising}} the original townsite of Quinns, {{up until the}} 1990s, is colloquially known as [...] "Old Quinns". The area is characterized by rolling hills and roads, overhead power lines on wooden poles, few pavements and many unique houses with distinct architectural designs dating from the 1960s and 1970s. Most of this area still relies on septic tanks for waste management rather than a linked sewerage system, although infill <b>sewerage</b> <b>works</b> are scheduled in future.|$|R
40|$|Hydraulic {{excavators}} {{are widely}} used in mining and construction. They {{have an important role}} in mine loading cycle. These machines have three major parts: <b>work</b> <b>equipment,</b> upper structure and lower structure. The <b>work</b> <b>equipment</b> that is for digging and loading includes boom, arm and bucket. Because of the operation of the <b>work</b> <b>equipment,</b> it has got more failures in comparison with other parts. In this paper reliability modeling of <b>work</b> <b>equipment</b> according to the method of analytic solution of the proposed model has been made. After estimating of model parameters, system failure rate has been calculated and failure behavior is assessed. The reliability of <b>work</b> <b>equipment</b> system reduces to 80 % after 30 hours of operation and it reach zero after about 360 hours. The failure rate increases at a decreasing rate and after 360 hours it will be at a rate of 0. 021. Godkänd; 2014; Bibliografisk uppgift: Bidraget på persiska.; 20131213 (hadhos...|$|R

50|$|The East Gordon Street <b>Sewerage</b> <b>Works</b> in Mackay, {{opened in}} 1936, {{was one of}} the first in {{regional}} Queensland. As such, it is important in demonstrating the progressive upgrading of basic infrastructure in regional Queensland, in particular the provision of sewerage schemes, which took place in regional towns and cities from the interwar period. Most other regional centres did not develop such schemes until after World War II, with some local government areas not constructing sewerage infrastructure until after 1960.|$|R
