The valley parity operator is defined. Valley blockade {{is determined by the}} parity conservation of valley composition eigenvectors in quantum transport. A Silicon quantum <b>changeover</b> <b>switch</b> based on a triple of donor quantum dots capable to separate electrons having opposite valley parity by virtue of the valley parity conservation is proposed.

40|$|The monocular {{indirect}} {{argon laser}} photocoagulator has been newly developed through NIDEK CO. LTD, Japan. This instrument {{consists of a}} monocular indirect ophthalmoscopic delivery system, a beam control box, a standard slit-lamp delivery system and a <b>changeover</b> <b>switch.</b> The characteristics of this photocoagulator are as follows: a easier application, better viewing of whole fundus during retinal photocoagulation, effective photocoagulation in supine position, posibility to change direct photocoagulator or indirect one by the <b>changeover</b> <b>switch</b> and photocoagulation viewed from all directions around the patient head. After confirming the condition and safety by experimenting on rabbits eyes, laser photo coagulation is to be performed on diabetic retinopathy, retinal tear, branch occlusion of retinal vein, retinal neovascularization, retinal macroaneurysm and retinopathy of prematurity. Especially this monocular indirect argon laser photocoagulation can be applied more effectively than xenon light coagulation on the retinopathy of prematurity thanks to overall view of the fundus in supine position. While {{on the other hand}} it has two unfavorable points, i. e. it is unstable to be fixed and that fine and delicate laser photocoagulation in the mascular area cannot be performed. So it is preferable to use it combinatively with a slit-lamp type by <b>changeover</b> <b>switch,</b> depending on the conditions of the fundus...|$|R

50|$|Transmission gates {{are used}} in order to realize {{electronic}} switches and analog multiplexers. If a signal is connected to different outputs (<b>changeover</b> <b>switches,</b> multiplexers), multiple transmission gates {{can be used as}} a transmission gate to either conduct or block (simple switch). A typical example is known as the 4066 4-way analog switch which is available from various manufacturers.|$|R

50|$|A {{recent review}} by McDowell reveals that Herrnstein's {{original}} equation fails to accurately describe concurrent-schedule data under a substantial range of conditions.Three deviations from matching have been observed: undermatching, overmatching and bias. Undermatching {{means that the}} response proportions are less extreme than the law predicts. Undermatching can happen if subjects too often switch between the two response options, a tendency that may be strengthened by reinforcers that happen to occur just after a subject <b>switches.</b> A <b>changeover</b> delay {{may be used to}} reduce the effectiveness of such post-switch reinforcers; typically, this is a 1.5 second interval after a switch when no reinforcer is presented. Overmatching is the opposite of undermatching, and is less common. Here the subjects response proportions are more extreme than reinforcement proportions. Overmatching may occur if there is a penalty for switching. A final deviation is bias, which occurs when subjects spend more time on one alternative than the matching equation predicts. This may happen if a subject prefers a certain environment, area in a laboratory or method of responding.|$|R
50|$|In {{most modern}} installations, an {{electronic}} device called a tachometric relay or safety switch {{is used to}} operate electrical shut-off solenoids. These work by sensing that the engine is running by detecting ignition pulses. Some systems use an engine oil pressure sensor instead. In all installations, there is a filterlock (consisting of a filter assembly and a vacuum or electric solenoid operated shut-off valve) located at the input to the converter. In European converters, {{there is also a}} solenoid in the converter to shut off the idle circuit. These valves are usually both connected to the output of the tachometric relay or oil pressure switch. Where solenoids are fitted to the outputs of fuel tanks, these are also connected to the output of the tachometric relay or oil pressure switch. In installations with multiple tanks, a <b>switch</b> or <b>changeover</b> relay may be fitted to allow the driver to select which tank to use fuel from. On bi-fuel, the switch used to change between fuels is used to turn off the tachometric relay.|$|R
50|$|In 1955 the {{original}} Mersey Railway fourth-rail system {{was replaced with}} the third-rail system adopted by LMS from Birkenhead Park to New Brighton and West Kirby, removing the need for automatic <b>changeover</b> <b>switches.</b> Despite the design already being 19 {{years old at the}} time, a new batch of 28 third-rail-only Class 503 units was delivered the following year. Of these, 24 were ordered as replacements for {{the original}} Mersey Railway trains, and the remaining four to replace stock damaged during the Second World War. As each new train was placed in service, a Mersey Railway train was withdrawn and hauled by steam locomotive to Horwich Works for breaking up.|$|R
50|$|The {{root cause}} of {{destructive}} transients in Korndörfer starters, it is random <b>switching</b> of the <b>changeover</b> of motor current. The uncontrolled timing of the changeover allows the peak motor current to be switched at any point on the wave. Figure 5 shows the changeover at 90 degrees. This is a worst-case scenario, peak current at changeover, creates a very high and fast transient. The central switch circuit prevents voltage escalation, as discussed above.It is therefore desirable to control the point on the wave at which to switch, the ideal point is when the motor amperes to the lowest value in all the active windings of the autotransformer.|$|R
50|$|Another {{latching}} type has a remanent core that {{retains the}} {{contacts in the}} operated position by the remanent magnetism in the core. This type requires a current pulse of opposite polarity to release the contacts. A variation uses a permanent magnet that produces part of the force required to close the contact; the coil supplies sufficient force to move the contact open or closed by aiding or opposing the field of the permanent magnet. A polarity controlled relay needs <b>changeover</b> <b>switches</b> or an H bridge drive circuit to control it. The relay may be less expensive than other types, but this is partly offset by the increased costs in the external circuit.|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe Drosophila sex {{pheromone}} cVA elicits different {{behaviors in}} males and females. First- and second-order olfactory neurons show identical pheromone responses, suggesting that sex genes differentially wire circuits {{deeper in the}} brain. Using in vivo whole-cell electrophysiology, we now show that two clusters of third-order olfactory neurons have dimorphic pheromone responses. One cluster responds in females; the other responds in males. These clusters are present in both sexes and share a common input pathway, but sex-specific wiring reroutes pheromone information. Regulating dendritic position, the fruitless transcription factor both connects the male-responsive cluster and disconnects the female-responsive cluster from pheromone input. Selective masculinization of third-order neurons transforms their morphology and pheromone responses, demonstrating that circuits can be functionally rewired by the cell-autonomous action of a switch gene. This bidirectional switch, analogous to an electrical <b>changeover</b> <b>switch,</b> provides a simple circuit logic to activate different behaviors in males and females...|$|R
40|$|Performance on {{concurrent}} schedules can be decomposed to run lengths (the {{number of}} responses before switching alternatives), or visit durations (time at an alternative before switching alternatives), that are {{a function of the}} ratio of the rates of reinforcement for staying and switching. From this analysis, a model of concurrent performance was developed and examined in two experiments. The first exposed rats to variable-interval schedules for staying and for switching, which included a changeover delay for reinforcers following a <b>switch.</b> With the <b>changeover</b> delay, run lengths and visit durations were functions of the ratios of the rates of reinforcement for staying and for switching, as found by previous research not using a changeover delay. The second directly assessed the effect of a changeover delay on run lengths and visit durations. Each component of a multiple schedule consisted of equivalent stay and switch schedules but only one component included a changeover delay. Run lengths and visit durations were longer when a changeover delay was used. Because visit duration is the reciprocal of changeover rate, these results are consistent with the established finding that a changeover delay reduces the frequency of switching. Together these results support the local model of concurrent performance {{as an alternative to the}} generalized matching law as a model of concurrent performance. The local model may be preferred when accounting for more molecular aspects of concurrent performance...|$|R
40|$|Summary Cells {{exposed to}} ER-stress undergo the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) to avoid apoptosis, {{but may also}} {{activate}} autophagy. However, the signal for selection {{of one of these}} two protective responses is unknown. To clarify the key switch between autophagy and apoptosis, we examined the correlation of UPR-related signals with autophagy and/or apoptosis inductions in HepG 2 cells exposed to three ER-stress inducers (NaF, tunicamycin, and thapsigargin) with time, including the effect of small interfering RNA on the cell responses. Thapsigargin-induced ER-stress caused only apoptosis after ∼ 2  hr with Ire 1 phosphorylation, and Grp 78, ATF 4, and CHOP expressions. On the other hand, NaF- and tunicamycin-induced ER-stress caused only autophagy in the early stage by ∼ 8  hr with ATF 4 expression and without CHOP expression. ATF 4 -siRNA completely inhibited the autophagy induced by NaF or tunicamycin with suppressed ATF 4 protein and mRNA expressions, and also inhibited apoptosis by thapsigargin with suppression of both ATF 4 and CHOP. CHOP-siRNA had no effect on autophagy activation by NaF and tunicamycin. On the other hand, CHOP-siRNA activated autophagy in thapsigargin-induced ER-stress with significant ATF 4 expression, and suppressed apoptosis with CHOP suppression. These results showed that ATF 4 is the key signal for autophagy induced by ER-stress, and that autophagy is switched to apoptosis by subsequent CHOP upregulation, suggesting that the <b>changeover</b> <b>switch</b> between autophagy and apoptosis is located between ATF 4 to CHOP in the PERK pathway...|$|R
5000|$|With the {{electrical}} generator (a large dynamo) for the motor permanently {{connected to the}} petrol engine, the early petrol electric controls available were a sprung return throttle pedal (with a hand operated variable latching throttle to set and adjust the idle speed), a brake pedal, a means of steering (wheel, etc) and two usually column mounted levers. One centre off lever operated a three position <b>changeover</b> <b>switch</b> to permit running in either direction, and the other lever operated a wiper across a bank of large high current wire wound resistances which affected the motor and dynamo fields, to give {{the electrical}} effect of gearing. It was (is, {{the author of this}} section has maintained and driven a 1914 TS3 model for over fifteen years as of 2015) very important to set the minimum possible idle speed, or when engaging the direction switch excess load on the system and possible unwanted movement will occur. The resistance [...] "gear" [...] lever is then set to max torque, and then the direction lever set to (say) forward. On releasing the handbrake and pressing the throttle pedal a little the vehicle will glide away smoothly. Giving more throttle and gradually altering the resistance lever will then produce higher speed, with none of the jerking and pauses in acceleration of a gearbox. To stop, the throttle pedal is released, the resistance lever is brought back to [...] "slow speed", the brake applied and as rest is achieved the forward/reverse lever moved to neutral and handbrake applied. There is however NO engine braking available as from a mechanical drive changed into a lower gear, so the system relies totally on the mechanical wheel brakes, which on early chassis applied to the rear axle only.|$|R
