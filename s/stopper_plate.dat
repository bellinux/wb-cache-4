40|$|The {{fragmentation}} of a 550 MeV/u primary beam of Ni- 58 on a Be- 9 target {{has been used}} to measure time-and energy-correlated gamma decays following the implantation of event-by-event discriminated secondary fragments into a Be- 9 <b>stopper</b> <b>plate.</b> A new isomeric gamma decay with T- 1 / 2 = 14 (6 4) ns and E-gamma = 646. 2 (2) keV is observed and attributed to the decay of the yrast 3 / 2 -state in Co- 53 (27) 26. This short-lived isomeric state has been populated by means of nuclear reactions during the stopping process of the secondary fragments. The experimental findings are discussed in the framework of large-scale spherical shell model calculations in conjunction with isospin symmetry-breaking residual interactions for the A = 53, Tz = +/- 1 / 2 mirror nuclei Co- 53 and Fe- 53...|$|E
40|$|A {{cryogenic}} storage ring (CSR) {{is under construction}} at the MPI-K Heidelberg. It consists of electrostatic elements and has a circumference of ~ 35 m. The CSR shall be used for storage of rotationally non-excited molecules and highly charged ions, therefore extremely low temperatures (< 4 K) and gas pressures (10 - 15 mbar) are required. The ring shall also be operational at room temperature and bakeable to at least 300 °C. The maximum energy of singly charged ions is 300 keV, the intensities {{will be in the}} range 1 nA – 1 μA. For the mass range, A< 100 is taken as reasonable design value, in later stages of CSR operation experiments with heavier ions are foreseen. Due to the exceptional boundary conditions we are working on new or further developments for most of the diagnostics devices. For example our RGMs have to produce their own local pressure bumps. The MCPs have to work at temperatures around 4 K. The beam position pickups shall be operated in resonant mode for increased sensitivity. Our beam profiler will use secondary electrons from a <b>stopper</b> <b>plate,</b> which allows beam imaging in the intensity range 102 to 1012 pps. For intensity measurements a SQUID CCC system is under discussion...|$|E
40|$|Samples of {{pore water}} will be {{collected}} by the methods described below. Samples from water more than three feet deep may be collected from a boat or sampling barge. Pore water samples will be collected from the top six inches of sediment, which is typically the zone of maximum biological activity. Samples will be collected {{by means of the}} sampling device illustrated in Figure 1. The pore water sample device consists of a steel drive point with a 6 -inch-long screen at the end. Attached to the drive point will be a metal or PVC <b>stopper</b> <b>plate,</b> which will prevent the drive point from being driven into the sediment beyond the desired depth. The pore water samples will be collected using a peristaltic pump and a length of PVC tubing inserted to the depth of the screen. The sampling device will be pushed into the sediment to the desired depth and then the peristaltic pump will be turned on. Field parameters (e. g., DO, ORP, pH, temperature, turbidity, and conductivity) may also be measured and recorded. Purging will be considered complete when DO, turbidity, conductivity, and pH have approached the stabilization goals provided below, for three consecutive readings taken at intervals of approximately five minutes: • DO and turbidity: 10...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{to search for}} a T-violating muon polarization in K + → π 0 µ + ν decay at J-PARC is currently being prepared. The most essential component in this experiment is the active polarimeter for the determination of the µ + and e + tracks to reduce the systematic error to below the 10 − 4 level. The active polarimeter consists of muon <b>stopper</b> <b>plates</b> with gaps which function as multi-wire drift chambers. For the position determination in each gap, normal drift time and charge division analyses are employed in the beam and the radial directions, respectively. In order to check the performance of the polarimeter chamber, we constructed a 1 / 5 prototype model and carried out a test experiment at the Fuji Test Beam Line (FTBL) in KEK. The chamber efficiency integrated over the entire chamber volume was obtained to be higher than 99. 5 %. The most probable straight line was obtained by a least-squares-method from the observed hit positions. The position resolution of each layer was determined from the width of (fit−data) residual distribution to be 2 mm in σ. The chamber efficiency and position resolution are good enough to perform the TREK experiment using a polarimeter chamber based on the current design...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} a methodology for the numerical simulation of reed valves of a small-size reciprocating compressor (approximately 200 mm in length, 60 mm in diameter), oil free and operating at high frequency. A fluidstructure interaction methodology is employed, where the fluid domain is modeled by the tridimensional transient Navier-Stokes equations, while the solid domain {{is governed by}} a beam model considering geometrical contacts between valves and <b>stoppers</b> (valve <b>plate,</b> piston, etc.) Results are shown for mass flow, pump power consumption and valve losses for evaporating temperatures ranging from - 15 degrees Celsius to + 40 degrees Celsius, and condensing temperatures from + 45 degrees Celsius to + 85 degrees Celsius. Finally, numerical results were compared to experimental data...|$|R

40|$|Nitrate {{levels in}} farm ponds are {{determined}} {{with the aid}} of a water sampler that can be operated from the shore The quality of pond water in southern and western Illinois is being determined {{with the aid of}} a new type of water sampler developed in the Department of Agricultural Engineering. Work on the sampler began as part of a study of water supplies in Washington County. This study, which is being conducted through the College of Agriculture Council on Environmental Quality, was initiated in the winter of 1970, after high nitrate levels were found in the county 2 ̆ 7 s water supplies. Both ponds and wells are being sampled to determine their acceptability as sources of water. For accurate tests of pond water, samples must be obtained at various depths and distances from the shore. A boat, however, is bulky and difficult for one person to handle. The new sampler was therefore devised so that an investigator can sample pond water at any depth without ever leaving the shore. How the sampler is made The sampler consists of a telescoping rod manufactured for window- washing units; a float, a sampler head, and a bottle at one end of the rod (Fig. 1); and a T-handle and two operating reels at the other end (Fig. 2). One reel contains the cord to the float; the other, the cord that operates the sampler head. Cord guides are attached to the rod sections. The sampler head (Fig. 1) is made up of three components: the sampler head base, the bottle plate, and the <b>stopper</b> <b>plate.</b> The sampler head base is attached to the sampling rod and contains the water port through which water enters the sample bottle. An extension to the water port, which extends into the sample bottle, is attached to the sampler head base. In addition, the base contains an air e cape port. The bottle plate is attached to the sampler head base and is fabricated with threads for the sample bottle. The bottle plate may be easily removed from the sampler head base so that other bottle plates fitting different sample bottles may be used with the same sampler head. The <b>stopper</b> <b>plate</b> with stopper is spring-loaded to seal the water port while it is being positioned for sampling and after the sample has been taken. How the sampler works To obtain a sample, the rod is extended to the desired length and the bottle is attached to the sampler head on the pond shore (Fig. 3 a). The bottle and sampler head are floated to the desired position on the pond surface with the float held tightly to the sampler end of the rod (Fig. 3 b). The cord to the float is then released to allow the sampler head and bottle to sink to the desired sampling depth (Fig. 3 c) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{research}} project was recently initiated which requires that water quality samples {{be taken from}} small ponds and lagoons in west-central Illinois. A method for obtaining these pond water samples was desired that could be handled conveniently by one person and would not require a small boat. The pond water sampler described here was developed to satisfy this need. The sampler developed allows one person to obtain a water sample at any desired depth while remaining on the shore. After assembling the device it may be floated to any position on the pond surface, lowered to the desired depth, and a sample taken. It is then retrieved by following the previous steps in reverse order as illustrated in Fig. 1. Water samples have been obtained {{at a distance of}} 40 ft from the pond shore and at a depth of 16 ft below the pond surface. The pond water sampler consists of a telescoping rod, manufactured for window washing units, with a T-handle and fishing rod reels on one end (Fig. 2); and the sampler head (Fig. 3) and float on the other end. Cords run from the operator end of the sampler to the sampler head and float to allow the operator to control the float and sampler head. The sampler head holds the sample bottle and may be triggered to allow sampling to occur when the operator desires. The sampler (Fig. 3) consists of three separate components: the sampler head base, the bottle plate, and the <b>stopper</b> <b>plate.</b> The sampler head base is attached to the telescoping rod and contains the water port through which water enters the sample bottle. An extension to the water port which extends into the sample bottle is attached to the sampler head base. Additionally, the base contains an air escape port. The bottle plate is attached to the sampler head base and is fabricated with threads for the sample bottle. The bottle plate may be easily removed from the sampler head base so that other bottle plates fitting different sample bottles may be used with the same sampler head. The <b>stopper</b> <b>plate</b> with stopper is spring loaded to seal the water port while it is being positioned for sampling and after the sample has been taken. To obtain a sample the rod is extended to the desired length and the bottle is attached to the sampler head on the pond shore (Fig. la). The bottle and sampler head is floated to the desired position on the pond surface with the float held tightly to the sampler end of the rod (Fig. lb). The cord to the float is then released to allow the sampler head and bottle to sink to the desired sampling depth (Fig. lc). When the desired depth is reached, the sampler head cord is pulled and water is allowed to fill the sample bottle (Fig. ld). Pulling the sampler head cord removes the stopper from the water port thus allowing the bottle to fill with water through the water port and extension. The air is allowed to escape through the small air escape port in the sampler head base and is conducted {{a few feet from the}} sampler head through a flexible tube. This reduces the possibility of escaping air changing the oxygen content of the water which is being sampled. The sampler head and bottle are returned to the surface using the float and float cord (Fig. le), and the apparatus is floated back to the shore (Fig. lf) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a new design method of {{lightweight}} parts fabricated by selective laser melting (SLM) based on the “Skin-Frame” and to explore the influence of fabrication defects on SLM parts with different sizes. Some standard lattice parts were designed according to the Chinese GB/T 1452 - 2005 standard and manufactured by SLM. Then these samples were tested in an MTS Insight 30 compression testing machine to study the trends of the yield process with different structure sizes. A set of standard cylinder samples were also designed according to the Chinese GB/T 228 - 2010 standard. These samples, which were made of iron-nickel alloy (IN 718), were also processed by SLM, and then tested in the universal material testing machine INSTRON 1346 to obtain their tensile strength. Furthermore, a lightweight redesigned method was researched. Then some common parts such as a <b>stopper</b> and connecting <b>plate</b> were redesigned using this method. These redesigned parts were fabricated and some application tests have already been performed. The compression testing results show that when the minimum structure size is larger than 1. 5 mm, the mechanical characteristics will hardly be affected by process defects. The cylinder parts were fractured by the universal material testing machine at about 1069. 6 MPa. These redesigned parts worked well in application tests, with both the weight and fabrication time of these parts reduced more than 20 %...|$|R
