40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an Optical 3 D Shaft Inspection System needed for the survey and monitoring of Water Handling Shafts in the German Ruhrgebiet. The development is part of the RAG R&D project “ABSMon”. The end of the German hard coal mining at the end of 2018 has been determined with the Steinkohlefinanzierungsgesetz (SteinkohleFinG) from 2007 - 12 - 20. About three hundred years before now the near surface hard coal mining began in the southern Ruhr Area and in our days advanced to the northern Ruhr Area with mining depth of around - 1. 500 meters. The mine workings are kept dry by mine water pumping. When the active mining activities will have finished a controlled Water Handling will raise and keep the mine water to levels predetermined by the Mining Authorities. A monitoring with a mobile wireline <b>shaft</b> <b>survey</b> system is needed to run the Water Handling Shafts for an enduring Water Management. At the moment only laser scanner systems are available, but also optical systems are needed to enable the near real-time inspection with 3 D presentation and 3 D examination during the measurement campaign. An approach is presented that uses a camera to generate high resolution and textured 3 D models of mining shafts and tunnels for inspection purposes...|$|E

In {{this paper}} we propose a robust image and sensor based {{approach}} for automatic 3 d model acquisition of sewer <b>shafts</b> from <b>survey</b> videos captured by a downward-looking fisheye-lens camera while lowering it into the shaft. Our approach is based on Structure from Motion adjusted to the constrained motion and scene, and involves shape recognition in order to obtain the geometry of the scene appropriately. The approach has been implemented and applied successfully to the practical stage as part of a commercial software. ...|$|R

50|$|The tunnel was mined by {{hand through}} shale, coal and sandstone, then lined with six courses of bricks (using over 23 million bricks in all) {{to form the}} {{horseshoe}} shape. It was aligned by drilling fourteen vertical <b>shafts</b> to provide <b>survey</b> points on the hillside above: after the tunnel was completed two shafts were closed and the remaining twelve were used as blast relief shafts to vent steam from the locomotives that passed through.|$|R
50|$|The mine {{workings}} are aligned along the strike of the reef and include, {{on the terrace}} level, a caved main shaft and an earlier shaft. An adit has been driven in from the gully to meet the main shaft. A single cylinder portable steam engine is located alongside the main <b>shaft.</b> (Since a <b>survey</b> of the site in 1982 a pump arm has been placed alongside the main shaft). Mullock has been dumped into the gully to form a dam. The watercourse now bypasses the dump. Another group of workings comprising a shaft and mullock dumps is located about 100 m south-east on a spur of the ridge.|$|R
40|$|Lukavice {{village is}} located in Eastern Bohemia and it {{is known for its}} {{historical}} pyrite mining. The first mention of mining comes from the beginning of 17 th century. The mines were abandoned in 1892 due to a significant depletion of the upper parts of the deposit and also because of the competition of cheaper pyrite from abroad. Old mine workings were often backfilled incompletely and their exact location is unknown. The occurrence of empty mine workings under the roads in the village centre could cause a collapse of the ground under the weight of heavy trucks which carry through Lukavice village aggregate from the nearby quarry. The aim of geophysics was to determine the thickness of dump material (seismics), subsidence monitoring in the village centre (repeated levelling) and the principal aim was to locate old mine galleries and <b>shafts</b> (gravity <b>survey).</b> Gravity measurements did not prove the presence of empty mine workings under the main road at the village centre. Most pronounced negative Bouguer anomaly, which occurs in the vicinity of Bartolomějská jáma schaft, may be caused by higher degree of alteration of underlying porphyroids. According to historical maps and photos we determined approximate location of the former water pit Vilemina. For the determination of the exact position of the [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{comparison}} of the abilities of Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) and Self-Potential Tomography (SPT) to detect and characterize buried mineshafts at the site of a former colliery. Surface electrical resistivity and self-potential (SP) surveys were carried out at two test sites, each containing a hidden <b>shaft.</b> The ERT <b>survey</b> results indicate that both sites had a highly heterogeneous subsurface resistivity distribution, which we attribute to colliery spoil and former infrastructure. ERT managed to distinguish an air-filled, highly resistive mineshaft from this background, but failed to detect the second shaft, which was backfilled and therefore had a much lower resistivity contrast with the surrounding formation. However, SPT located both shafts, gave an indication of their size, shape and depth of burial, and was able to distinguish the open- from the backfilled mineshaft due to the strength of the associated SP anomalies. We argue that these SP anomalies are likely to be due to changes in the streaming potential caused by preferential drainage into the shafts. ...|$|R
2500|$|... was sunk on 10 December 1941, {{from what}} was {{believed}} to have been hits by six aerial launched torpedoes and a 500kg bomb. However, an extensive 2007 survey by divers of the wreck of Prince of Wales determined definitively that there had been only 4 torpedo hits. Three of these four hits had struck the hull outside the area protected by the SPS. In the case of the fourth, the SPS holding bulkhead appeared intact abreast the area where the hull was hit. The conclusion of the subsequent 2009 paper and analysis was that the primary cause of the sinking was uncontained flooding along [...] "B" [...] propeller shaft. The propeller shaft external shaft bracket failed, and the movement of the unsupported shaft then tore up the bulkheads {{all the way from the}} external propeller shaft gland through to B Engine Room itself. This allowed flooding into the primary machinery spaces. The damage and flooding was exacerbated by poor damage control and the premature abandonment of the after magazines and a telephone communications switchboard. [...] "B" [...] propeller shaft had been stopped, and then restarted several minutes after being struck by a torpedo. Subsequent inquiries into her loss at the time identified the need for a number of design improvements, which were implemented to a lesser or greater degree on the other four ships of the class. Ventilation and the watertightness of the ventilation system were improved, while internal passageways within the machinery spaces were redesigned and the communications system made more robust. Improved propeller shaft glands and shaft locking gear were introduced. Some of the supposed failures of the ship were nevertheless predicated on the assumption that a torpedo had hit and defeated the SPS at or about frame 206 at the same time as the hit that damaged B propeller <b>shaft.</b> The 2007 <b>survey's</b> [...] video footage evidence showed however that the hull is basically intact in this area. The inability to survey the wreck during the war no doubt frustrated efforts to arrive at a definitive cause for the loss of Prince of Wales and, subsequently, that somewhat flawed analysis has led to a number of incorrect theories regarding the reasons for the sinking being inadvertently disseminated over the years.|$|R
