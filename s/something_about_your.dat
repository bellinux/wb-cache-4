5|$|I said, 'Mr. Malcolm, {{could you}} tell me <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> mother?' And I will never, ever forget how he stopped almost as if he was {{suspended}} like a marionette. And he said, 'I remember the kind of dresses she used to wear. They were old and faded and gray.' And then he walked some more. And he said, 'I remember how she was always bent over the stove, trying to stretch what little we had.' And that was the beginning, that night, of his walk. And he walked that floor until just about daybreak.|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, Mary Louise! Here {{is an old}} {{letter about}} your mother--yes, and here's <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> grandfather, too. How strange that it should be--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, that's it, is it!" [...] cried {{one of the}} men. [...] "Seems to me I heard <b>something</b> <b>about</b> that. <b>Your</b> uncle {{played the}} regular hero act." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All this," [...] said I, [...] "because {{they said}} <b>something</b> disrespectful <b>about</b> <b>your</b> machine {{at the last}} inn... You don't, I see, approve of the {{feminine}} bicycle?" ...|$|R
60|$|Harry. There, there. I am not {{trespassing}} in the street--where I stand--am I? Tell you what, I fancy there's <b>something</b> wrong <b>about</b> <b>your</b> news. Suppose {{you let me}} come in--for a quiet chat, you know.|$|R
6000|$|Challoner {{gave her}} a sharp glance and then said, [...] "I'm sorry. Mrs. Foster {{mentioned}} <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> not walking much; I should have remembered." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Though {{my opinion}} of Blake is not {{generally}} held, I {{believe you are}} right," [...] she said. [...] "And now tell me <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> journey." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well then, Margaret, look here. I {{want to know}} <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> brother's affairs. From what I have heard, I {{fear they}} were not very good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You said <b>something</b> then <b>about</b> <b>your</b> boat {{being a good}} sea-going craft, {{and that}} it was as roomy as many a yacht. I think I told you that I might give it a try some day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Hank Griswold {{has been}} caught and has made a confession,” put in Leo. “So your game is up, Nathan Dobb. I always thought there was <b>something</b> wrong <b>about</b> <b>your</b> doings {{concerning}} my parents’ estate, and now I know it.” ...|$|R
6000|$|The stranger, unaware how near he was {{of having}} his head laid open with a spade, said seriously: [...] "I am not {{trespassing}} where I stand, am I? I fancy there's <b>something</b> wrong <b>about</b> <b>your</b> news. Suppose you let me come in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear, I don't {{intend to}} walk home; I shall take a cab," [...] said the mild little woman. [...] "Do tell me <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> department." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “We’ll {{let that}} go; I need help. You can {{begin with the}} {{stacking}} gang, but something better may turn up. Now tell me <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> northern trip.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{question}} is withdrawn, Mr. Brice," [...] said the Judge, [...] "Virginia, you may strike {{it from the}} records. And now, sir, tell me <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> trip." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've had none. When {{you found}} the tobacco-box I knew I would succeed. There was <b>something</b> strangely {{significant}} <b>about</b> <b>your</b> finding it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is <b>something</b> {{familiar}} <b>about</b> <b>your</b> face," [...] he said; [...] "but I cannot place you. Nor does it {{make any}} difference who you are--you have risked your life to save ours and I shall not leave you. Let Mr. Harding go--it is not necessary for both to stay." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There is <b>something</b> hazy <b>about</b> <b>your</b> friend Davis's writings. I {{know some}} of his publications, and sympathise to a very {{considerable}} extent with him. But I can't be sure that I always understand him: that school has a language of its own, and I am not so far initiated as to follow.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you find}} {{gratitude}} {{hard to put}} up with. It seems that your sister Hilda has told Clare <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> adventures. You had some rough experiences in Canada?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Like you! Oh, I {{suppose you}} mean he's <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> size. Well, I don't wonder at that, for you're an uncommonly big fellow, Dick; but I fancy his {{appearance}} is very different." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> doings in the past--doings {{which are}} of no credit to you. If you disgrace Ben and me by {{degrading}} us in classes, we'll disgrace you by telling all we know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm {{afraid it}} would be no treat to her.' Then she turned again to her son. 'Winifred tells me the doctor had <b>something</b> to say <b>about</b> <b>your</b> father. What is it?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am quite}} sure of it," [...] she admitted; [...] "but {{then it is}} so like you to arrive just at a crisis! Do you know, I can't help fancying that there is <b>something</b> {{theatrical}} <b>about</b> <b>your</b> comings and goings! You appear--and one looks for a curtain and a tableau. Where could you have dropped from this morning?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Better go slow," [...] urged {{one of his}} friends. [...] "That chap {{looks to}} me like one of the old guard. He may have <b>something</b> to say <b>about</b> <b>your</b> doings with his daughter." ...|$|R
6000|$|He colored, {{but gave}} her a steady look. [...] "That is so. I admit the thing's ridiculous; but at first I felt I'd better pull out. Then I noted <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> pose; you looked angry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Foulton said <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> having {{engaged the}} rooms for another week," [...] he said, turning back. [...] "Of course, {{if you insist}} upon staying, it will place the woman in a very awkward position." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will find," [...] Pamela {{warned her}} {{companion}} almost {{as they took}} their places, [...] "that I am a very curious person. I am more interested in people than in events. Tell me <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> work at the War Office?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I must {{plead guilty}} to the surprise," [...] the Duke confessed courteously. [...] "There is <b>something</b> {{exceedingly}} familiar <b>about</b> <b>your</b> face, sir, but I cannot remember having {{had the privilege of}} meeting you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you bring}} me before the court I'll have <b>something</b> to say <b>about</b> <b>your</b> underhanded work with Ivan Snokoff. I can prove {{that he is a}} swindler and that you are his accomplice." ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Barrington {{looked at}} him steadily. [...] "Lance," [...] she said, [...] "there is <b>something</b> <b>about</b> you and <b>your</b> speeches that {{occasionally}} puzzles me. Now, of course, {{that was the only}} rejoinder you could make, but I fancied you meant it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{shall be}} glad to see her," [...] said the Altrurian, [...] "and to tell her {{everything}} I can. But won't you explain to me first <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> deserted farms here? It's quite a new thing to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The fact is, Mrs Frog," [...] said Giles Scott, {{coming to}} the rescue, [...] "Sir Richard is anxious to know <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> affairs--your family, you know, and your means of--by the way, where is baby?" [...] he said looking round the room.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am quite}} sure of that," [...] she answered. [...] "And {{now tell me}} <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> career in the City after you came to England. Do you know, I have {{scarcely}} ever been in what you financiers call the City. In a way it must be interesting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{be angry}} with me, or I shall be miserable. I really was not {{laughing}} at you; only, if you knew what wonderful eyes you have got, you would not ask such ridiculous questions <b>about</b> them. <b>Your</b> father must be a strange man to get such ideas. I am sure I should be delighted if you {{would look at me}} all day long. But tell me <b>something</b> more <b>about</b> <b>your</b> father: he interests me very much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed you do," [...] cried May Christian, [...] "and it is {{only last}} night that I heard you muttering <b>something</b> <b>about</b> Trafalgar in <b>your</b> sleep, and you {{suddenly}} broke out with a half-muttered shout like this: `Englan' 'specs every man'll do's dooty!'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think," [...] {{said the}} nobleman, rising and laying down the oyster, [...] "I {{ought to know}} <b>something</b> more {{definite}} <b>about</b> <b>your</b> antecedents before succouring you. If you couldn't agree with your mistress, you are probably no better than you should be." ...|$|R
