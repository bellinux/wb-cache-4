5|$|After Kieswetter's {{retirement}} from cricket, his father <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{take a break}} and play some golf. He had done so during his youth in South Africa, playing in provincial tournaments. After some lessons with David Leadbetter, who <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> try to become a professional golfer, Kieswetter began to enter amateur tournaments. After performing well in those events, he set himself a target of becoming a professional, and playing regularly on the European Tour. In late 2016, he took part in a couple of PGA EuroPro Tour tournaments and one on the MENA Golf Tour. In early 2017, he turned professional and in March played in the MENA Golf Tour qualifying school in Morocco, finishing tied for 31st place and earning a card for the 2017 season.

However, other Chandela inscriptions (including {{those of his}} own) <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> succeeded his grandfather Madanavarman. It is possible that Yashovarman ruled for a very short period, or did not rule at all, having died while Madanavarman was still alive.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{not entirely}} clear what school of combat Munetoshi studied, or who his {{teachers}} were. An Owari Yagyū family record <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> studied Shintō-ryū under a man named Kantori Shinjūrō. [...] But [...] "Kantori" [...] may simply be a misreading of kanji meant to read “Katori”, thus signifying [...] "Katori Shintō-ryū". An Edo Yagyū family record <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> studied Toda-ryū, a branch of Chūjō-ryū. [...] All family records and Munetoshi’s own surviving writings <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was an enthusiastic student of the military arts from a young age, before he met Kamiizumi Hidetsuna.|$|R

The ODI series was drawn, but the West Indies defeated Pakistan 2–0 in the Tests. Ambrose took nine wickets at 23.11 to be {{fifth in the}} team bowling averages. The Wisden report <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was suffering from fatigue after his team's busy schedule, but although not at his best, he continued to take important wickets. For Northamptonshire in 1993, Ambrose was second in the team first-class bowling averages with 59 wickets at 20.45.|$|E
5|$|Alfred Hitchcock's cameo is a {{signature}} occurrence {{in most of}} his films. In Psycho, he can be seen through a window—wearing a Stetson hat—standing outside Marion Crane's office. Wardrobe mistress Rita Riggs has said that Hitchcock chose this scene for his cameo {{so that he could}} be in a scene with his daughter (who played one of Marion's colleagues). Others have <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> chose this early appearance in the film in order to avoid distracting the audience.|$|E
5|$|As Dean of Saint Patrick's Cathedral, Jonathan Swift {{spent every}} fifth Sunday preaching from the pulpit. Although {{many of his}} friends <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should publish these sermons, Swift felt that he lacked the talent as a preacher to make his sermons worthy of publication. Instead, Swift spent his time working more on {{political}} works, such as Drapier's Letters, and justified this by his lacking in religions areas.|$|E

50|$|John Cambrian Rowland {{is mainly}} remembered for his {{collection}} of Welsh costume prints - many of these were published in 1848.

Entitled Über der Beweglichkeit Ladungsträger der Spitzenentladung ("On the Mobility of Ions"), it would subsequently {{be published in the}} Annalen der Physik.|$|E

5|$|By 1990, Moffat {{had written}} two series of Press Gang, but the programme's high cost along with {{organisational}} changes at Central cast its future in doubt. As Moffat wondered {{what to do}} next and worried about his future employment, Bob Spiers, Press Gangs primary director, <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> meet with producer Andre Ptaszynski to discuss writing a sitcom. Moffat's father had been a headteacher and Moffat himself had taught English before writing Press Gang, so his initial proposal was a programme similar to what would become Chalk, a series that eventually aired in 1997.|$|E

5|$|Critics {{disagree}} on Tristano's importance in jazz history. Max Harrison {{indicated that the}} pianist had limited influence outside his own group of affiliated musicians; Robert Palmer, who pointed out that only one of Tristano's albums was in print {{at the time of}} his death, <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was pivotal in the change from 1940s modern jazz to the freer styles of subsequent decades; and Thomas Albright similarly believed that his improvising prepared and developed new ground in the history of the music.|$|E
5|$|Ethan Gutmann, citing Falun Gong {{allegations}} that Liaoning was {{the epicenter of}} organ harvesting from practitioners while Bo was governor, <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> may have used his involvement {{as a way of}} building up his political power. David Kilgour, who co-wrote the Kilgour–Matas report on organ harvesting, accused Bo of playing a role. Separately, Falun Gong practitioners abroad filed over ten lawsuits against Bo alleging torture and crimes against humanity In 2009, a Spanish court indicted Bo Xilai and four other officials for genocide against Falun Gong.|$|E

The date of his reign <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> rebelled against Vologases IV {{but was unable to}} maintain himself against Vologases V. His coins were issued by the mint at Ecbatana, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> controlled Media.|$|R
5|$|He was {{commissioned}} second lieutenant in The Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own) {{at the start}} of the First World War and departed for the Western Front a few weeks later.

5|$|In 1897, Riley's {{publishers}} <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{create a}} multi-volume {{series of books}} containing his complete life works.

Such works were uncommon during the lives of writers, attesting to the uncommon popularity Riley had achieved.|$|E
5|$|In another work of Shakespeare, Othello (1603), it {{has been}} <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has made another reference. In act 5, scene 2 the main {{character}} Othello compares himself to a myrrh tree with its constant stream of tears (Myrrha's tears). The reference is justified {{in the way that}} it draws inspiration from Book X of Ovid's Metamorphoses, just like his previously written poem, Venus and Adonis, did.|$|E

His Kurud inscription states <b>that</b> <b>he</b> renewed a grant issued by the Parama-bhattaraka for the latter's merit. This <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> continued to acknowledge the Gupta suzerainty {{at least until the}} 24th year of his reign. The fact that the inscription omits the overlord's name <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had become practically independent, and acknowledged the Gupta suzerainty only nominally.|$|R
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Guys and Dollss success, Feuer and Martin were interested in adapting John Steinbeck's 1945 novel Cannery Row into a musical.

Steinbeck <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> write a sequel to Cannery Row that would feature the characters attractive to Feuer and Martin. Based on suggestions for the story line by Feuer and Martin, Steinbeck began to write Sweet Thursday.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourteenth}} season, Bart {{convinced}} Krusty {{to run for}} Congress so that Krusty could introduce an airline rerouting bill and stop planes from flying over the Simpsons' house. Krusty agreed and ran on the Republican ticket. Although his campaign started off badly, Lisa <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> try connecting with regular families, which Krusty did, resulting in a landslide victory. Krusty's term started off badly, as he was completely ignored by his new, more politically savvy colleagues. With {{the help of the}} Simpsons and an influential doorman, however, Krusty succeeded in passing his bill.|$|E
