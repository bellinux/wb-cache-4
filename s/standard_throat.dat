Even "gold <b>standard</b> " <b>throat</b> cultures are not perfectly accurate. This article is an analysis of how errors in the comparison cultures affect the apparent accuracy of new tests for streptococcal pharyngitis. One of the questions addressed is whether throat cultures performed in a physician’s office are accurate enough to use as a standard in a clinical trial of a new rapid test. While the accuracy of office cultures is accepted by many to be adequate for diagnostic purposes, this analysis shows that when evaluating a new test stricter conditions must be placed on the accuracy of the cultures used for comparison. Key words: test accuracy; laboratory diagnosis; strep-tococcal pharyngitis.

40|$|We {{consider}} the energy transfer {{necessary for the}} warped reheating scenario in a two-throat geometry. We study KK mode wavefunctions of the full two-throat system in the Randall [...] Sundrum approximation and find that wavepacket tunnelling is suppressed unless the <b>Standard</b> Model <b>throat</b> is very long. Nevertheless, wavefunctions of modes localized in different throats have a non-zero overlap and energy can be transferred between the throats by interactions between such KK modes. We calculate the corresponding decay rates and compare them to the decay rate into gravitons. Next {{we look at the}} effects of the imaginary parts of the mode frequencies, induced by the decay, on the calculation of the decay rates themselves, and find that the self-consistent decay rate can be significantly lower than the naive one. Taking this into account implies that successful warped reheating requires that the Planck scale controlling the coupling to gravitons be significantly higher than the curvature scale that controls the interactions of the relevant KK modes. Lastly, we discuss mechanisms that may enhance the energy transfer between the throats over the Randall [...] Sundrum rates. In particular, we study models in which the warp factor changes in the UV region less abruptly than in the RS model, and find that it is easy to build phenomenological models in which the plane wave tunnelling rate, and hence the KK mode interaction rates, are enhanced compared to the standard RS setup studied previously in the literature...|$|R

Well-known problems like the potentially dangerous back-reaction of brane/antibrane pairs and explicit supersymmetry breaking are not present in our scenario. However, the inflaton back-reaction starts to deform the geometry strongly once the field excursion approaches the Planck scale. We derive the system of differential equations required to treat this effect quantitatively. Numerical work is required to decide whether back-reaction makes the model suitable for realistic inflation. While we have to leave this crucial issue to future studies, we find it interesting that such a simple and explicit stringy monodromy model allows an originally sub-Planckian axion to go through many periods with full quantitative control before back-reaction becomes strong. Also, the mere existence of our ultra-light throat mode (with double exponentially suppressed mass) is noteworthy.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we study}} throats in the early, hot universe. Throats {{are a common}} feature of the {{landscape}} of type IIB string theory. If a throat is heated during cosmological evolution, energy is subsequently transferred to other throats and to the standard model. We calculate the heat transfer rate and the decay rate of throat-localized Kaluza-Klein states in a ten-dimensional model. For the calculation, we employ the dual description of the throats in terms of gauge theories. We discuss modifications of the decay rate which arise in flux compactifications and for Klebanov-Strassler throats and emphasize the role of tachyonic scalars in such throats in mediating decays of Kaluza-Klein modes. Our results are also applicable to the energy transfer from the heated <b>standard</b> model to <b>throats.</b> We determine the resulting energy density in throats at our epoch in dependence of their infrared scales and of the reheating temperature. The Kaluza-Klein modes in the throats decay to other sectors with a highly suppressed rate. If their lifetime is longer than {{the age of the}} universe, they are an interesting dark matter candidate. We show that, if the reheating temperature was 10 ^ 10 - 10 ^ 11 GeV, throats with infrared scales in the range of 10 ^ 5 GeV to 10 ^ 10 GeV can account for the observed dark matter. We identify several scenarios where this type of dark matter is sufficiently stable but where decays to the standard model can be discovere d via gamma-ray observations...|$|R
