This is, in part, because the human sense of vision is not equipped with a competent radiation detector that is independent of wavelength. "The ability to see is a partnership of light and sight [...] . " Photometry, a specification computed from a radiometric measurement, was developed as an attempt to capture what is human about human vision so that the sterile specifications of radiometry might be thus rendered more useful as a predictive tool. As it has developed and matured, photometry has become an exacting tool requiring sometimes extraordinary attention to detail that lies beyond the experience of many of us. But even with appropriate attention to detail, photometry takes account only of the spectral distribution of radiation in comparison to the <b>spectral</b> sensitivity (<b>luminous</b> <b>efficiency)</b> of the observer, {{and the size of the}} pupil. These characteristics of vision arise early in the perceptual chain. Other features of human vision, which vision science is beginning to systematically quantify, may be viewed as additional signposts pointing to the need for a more thorough humanization of radiometry. Visual illusions provide an example as do a variety of visual effects in which the percept is not veridical. This paper will review selected characteristics of human vision that point to the need for moving beyond photometry. Two examples, one involving the use of LED illuminants in traffic signals, and the other showing the theoretical advantages of a modified wing-tip strobe, will be used to illustrate the problem area. It is possible to foresee a future in which designers could use a photometric correction incorporating these additional factors...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was {{to find out how}} the {{spectral}} sensitivity of the human eye varies in peripheral vision at mesopic and low photopic luminance levels. Two different measurement methods were employed for this purpose. Reaction time and contrast threshold measurements were conducted at various mesopic and low photopic luminance levels in foveal and peripheral vision. Luminance levels between 0. 1  cd/m 2 and 20  cd/m 2 and visual target eccentricities of 0 °, 10 °, 30 ° and 60 ° were investigated in the measurements. Both measurement methods revealed the same observations: at low photopic luminance levels, the currently used V(λ) function is not the best descriptive <b>spectral</b> <b>luminous</b> <b>efficiency</b> function for peripheral vision. The short wavelengths were underestimated by the V(λ) function. A new <b>spectral</b> <b>luminous</b> <b>efficiency</b> function Vper(λ) was developed for peripheral vision at photopic light levels. This function is a linear combination of V(λ) and V 10 (λ) functions and takes into account the higher spectral sensitivity to short wavelengths as compared to the V(λ) function. Both measurement methods show that this function describes the spectral sensitivity of the eye better than V(λ), VM(λ) or V 10 (λ) functions at low photopic luminance levels (≤  20  cd/m 2). At mesopic luminance levels (≥  0. 1  cd/m 2), it was investigated how a linear combination of photopic and scotopic <b>spectral</b> <b>luminous</b> <b>efficiency</b> functions describes the spectral sensitivity of the eye in peripheral vision. A model for the mesopic <b>spectral</b> <b>luminous</b> <b>efficiency</b> function Vmes(λ) was developed for peripheral vision. The results showed that this function describes the peripheral spectral sensitivity with best accuracy at mesopic luminance levels. The new function was compared with the proposed unified system of photometry by Rea, Bullough, Freyssinier-Nova and Bierman (2004). The function developed in this work described the measurement results with much higher accuracy.

A curve-fitting program was then used to estimate the L/M cone ratios for the generated LEFs assuming standard L- and M-cone fundamentals. These modeling exercises indicate that L/M cone ratios estimated from LEFs are highly correlated with long-wave sensitivity and with known variations in L-cone λmax. Variations in M-cone λmax and photopigment optical density for both cone types are also correlated with L/M cone ratios, but have much less impact on the estimated ratios...|$|E

A preliminary study compared five LED packages with different proportions of green to white LED chips [42]. The result of psychophysical experiments shows that adding a small proportion of green chips into white LEDs could yield the same visual acceptability as that of pure white LEDs. Further investigations are required to find the optimal green-to-white proportion for energy saving and visual acceptability.|$|E

Generally, their research mainly focuses on three aspects: the color, power <b>luminous</b> <b>efficiency</b> and lifetime of the OLED. To compete the performance of conventional LEDs, the power luminance efficiency {{is the most important}} issue. The calculation of the efficiency of OLED is under direct current (DC) driving. However, for flat panel display applications such as a passive matrix OLED, the pixels are driven by pulse voltage and under a time division multiplexing driving scheme. Under this condition, it is reported that the power <b>luminous</b> <b>efficiency</b> will be drop dramatically when increasing the number of scanning lines.

40|$|Meteoroids {{cannot be}} {{observed}} directly {{because of their}} small size. In-situ measurements of the meteoroid environment are rare and have very small collecting areas. The Moon, in contrast, has a large collecting area and therefore {{can be used as}} a large meteoroid detector for gram-kilogram sized particles. Meteoroids striking the Moon create an impact flash observable by Earth-based telescopes. Their kinetic energy is converted to luminous energy with some unknown <b>luminous</b> <b>efficiency</b> (v), which is likely a function of meteoroid velocity (among other factors). This <b>luminous</b> <b>efficiency</b> is imperative to calculating the kinetic energy and mass of the meteoroid, as well as meteoroid fluxes, and it cannot be determined in the laboratory at meteoroid speeds and sizes due to mechanical constraints. Since laboratory simulations fail to resolve the <b>luminous</b> <b>efficiency</b> problem, observations of the impact flash itself must be utilized. Meteoroids associated with specific meteor showers have known speed and direction, which simplifies the determination of the <b>luminous</b> <b>efficiency.</b> NASA has routinely monitored the Moon for impact flashes since early 2006 [1]. During this time, several meteor showers have produced multiple impact flashes on the Moon, yielding a sufficient sample of impact flashes with which to perform a <b>luminous</b> <b>efficiency</b> analysis similar to that outlined in Bellot Rubio et al.

Using this light meter on the “Johnson Sea Link” submersible, we were able to ascend with the isolumes (preferred light levels) associated with the sergestid and euphausiid shrimp layers. The speed of the submersible 2 ̆ 7 s movement was recorded and correlated with simultaneous measurements of surface irradiance. In situ measurements of the downwelling spectral distribution were also made with a fiber optic spectrometer. The average measured speed of the sergestid isolume was 8. 8 [*]cm[*]s− 1, while that of the shallower euphausiid isolume was 6. 7 [*]cm[*]s− 1. These values are different from those calculated using average diffuse attenuation coefficients and surface light measurements. This difference was due to the broadening of the spectral distribution of downwelling light above 120 [*]m and to the variability of the diffuse attenuation coefficients with depth. These results clearly demonstrate that when investigating the relationship between light and vertical migration patterns, it is important that: (1) the light measurements be made in situ and (2) such measurements take into account the spectral sensitivity of the eyes of the migrators...|$|E
40|$|The first {{objective}} of this thesis was {{to find out how}} the background luminance level, spectra of the background and stimulus, and eccentricity of the stimulus affect contrast thresholds in the mesopic luminance range. The background luminance levels used were between LB= 0. 01 … 20  cd/m 2. They cover the typical luminance levels of road lighting. The spectra of the background and stimulus were broadband white, blue, green, and red. The measurements were made at eccentricities of 0 and 10 °. The results of this thesis confirmed that when the photopic background luminance level decreases from LB= 10  cd/m 2 to LB= 0. 01  cd/m 2 the contrast threshold increases at stimulus eccentricities of both 0 and 10 °. It was found that the contrast threshold increased the least with blue and the most with red background spectra when the background and stimulus had the same spectrum. When the background was white, the contrast threshold increased the least with blue and the most with red stimulus spectra. The results show that the spectral sensitivity of the eye is shifted towards shorter wavelengths when photopic background luminance levels are reduced from LB= 10 to LB= 0. 01  cd/m 2. The second objective was to find out the differences in the contrast threshold when a white or coloured background spectrum was used. It was found that the differences between the contrast thresholds measured with different stimuli and background spectra were larger when the measurements were taken with a coloured stimulus and a white background. The measured contrast thresholds were applied to existing models for mesopic spectral sensitivity. The goal was {{to find out if the}} models describe the mesopic contrast threshold in the same way for different stimulus and background spectra. The models used were Palmer's model [Palmer 1968], the X model [Rea et al 2004], and the MOVE model [Eloholma and Halonen 2005]. It was found that all the models used describe the spectral sensitivity at an eccentricity of 10 ° at the photopic background luminance levels LB= 0. 01 … 10  cd/m 2 better than the photopic <b>spectral</b> <b>luminous</b> <b>efficiency</b> function V(λ), when contrast threshold is used as a visual task. It was found that the MOVE model describes the mesopic contrast threshold best at the photopic background luminance levels LB= 0. 01 … 3  cd/m 2 when a white background and a coloured stimulus were used. Väitöskirjan ensimmäisenä tavoitteena oli selvittää, kuinka taustan luminanssitaso, taustan spektri ja ärsykkeen epäkeskeisyys vaikuttavat kontrastikynnykseen mesooppisella luminanssialueella. Käytetyt taustan luminassit olivat välillä LB= 0. 01 … 20  cd/m 2. Nämä luminanssitasot käsittivät tyypilliset tievalaistuksessa esiintyvät luminanssitasot. Taustan ja ärsykkeen spektrit olivat laajakaistaiset sininen, vihreä ja punainen. Mittaukset tehtiin 0 ja 10 ° epäkeskisyyksillä. Väitöskirjan tulokset vahvistivat sen, että taustan luminanssitason laskiessa arvosta LB= 10  cd/m 2 arvoon LB= 0. 01  cd/m 2 kontrastikynnys nousee sekä 0 että 10 ° epäkeskisyyksillä. Tuloksista nähtiin myös, että kontrastikynnys kasvaa vähiten sinisellä ja eniten punaisella taustan spektrillä kun taustan ja ärsykkeen spektrit olivat samat. Kun tausta oli valkoinen, kasvoi kynnyskontrasti vähiten sinisellä ja eniten punaisella ärsykkeellä. Tuloksista voitiin nähdä, että silmän spektriherkkyys siirtyy kohti lyhyitä aallonpituuksia kun taustan luminanssitaso laskee arvosta LB= 10  cd/m 2 arvoon LB= 0. 01  cd/m 2. Toinen tavoite oli selvittää, onko kynnyskontrastissa eroja kun taustan spektri oli valkoinen tai värillinen. Tuloksista nähtiin, että erot kontrastikynnyksissä olivat suuremmat, kun mittaukset oli tehty värillisellä ärsykkeellä ja valkoisella taustalla. Mitattuja kontrastikynnyksiä sovellettiin olemassa oleviin mesooppisiin malleihin. Tavoitteena oli selvittää, kuvaavatko mallit mesooppisia kontrastikynnyksiä samalla tavalla kun taustan ja ärsykkeen spektrit ovat samanlaiset ja kun ne olivat erilaiset. Sovelletut mallit olivat Palmerin malli [Palmer 1968], X-malli [Rea et al 2004] ja MOVE-malli [Eloholma ja Halonen 2005]. Tuloksista nähdään, että sovelletut mallit kuvaavat mesooppista spektriherkkyyttä 10 ° epäkeskisyydellä taustan luminanssitasoilla LB= 0. 01 … 10  cd/m 2 paremmin kuin fotooppinen silmän spektriherkkyysfunktio V(λ) kun kontrasti kynnystä käytetään näkötehtävänä. Tuloksista nähdään myös, että MOVE-malli kuvaa mesooppista kontrastikynnystä parhaiten taustan luminanssitasoilla LB= 0. 01 … 3  cd/m 2 kun tausta on valkoinen ja ärsyke on värillinen. reviewe...|$|E

The model is successfully compared with experimental <b>luminous</b> <b>efficiency</b> data from laboratory impacts and from astronomical determinations and scaling factors are estimated. Further work is proposed to clarify the effects of mass and density upon the <b>luminous</b> <b>efficiency</b> scaling factor...|$|R
40|$|Ionization and {{spectral}} emission (3500 - 4200 A) cross-sections {{have been}} measured for FE + N 2, O 2 reactions between 350 and 2000 eV. Meteor <b>luminous</b> <b>efficiencies</b> from 3500 to 5400 A were calculated from these measurements. These results {{are thought to}} be accurate within plus or minus 40 % for meteor velocities greater than 35 km/sec and at conditions where free molecular flow prevails. A general tendency is exhibited for a decrease in the <b>luminous</b> <b>efficiency</b> with increasing velocity. The present results compare favorably with previous meteor simulation experiments...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:Luminous {{efficiency}} of high power white light LED (light emitting diode) at different temperature and driver current is measured with the photometric, chromatic and electric characteristics analyzer. It is {{shown that the}} <b>luminous</b> <b>efficiency</b> decreases as the temperature and (or) the driver current increases. The highter the driver current is, the more strongly temperature worsens the efficiency. However, the changing rate of efficiency with current is similar at different temperature. At last, a <b>luminous</b> <b>efficiency</b> model with temperature and current is constructed. This research {{is very important for}} the design of energy-saving LED lamps...|$|R
