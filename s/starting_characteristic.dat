40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{analysis on the}} pricing of forward starting options under stochastic volatility and stochastic interest rates is performed. The main finding is that forward starting options not only depend on future smiles, but also directly {{on the evolution of}} the interest rates as well as the dependency structures among the underlying asset, the interest rates, and the stochastic volatility: compared to vanilla options, dynamic structures such as forward starting options are much more sensitive to model specifications such as volatility, interest rate, and correlation movements. We conclude that it is of crucial importance to take all these factors explicitly into account for a proper valuation and risk management of these securities. The performed analysis is facilitated by deriving closed-form formulas for the valuation of forward starting options, hereby taking the stochastic volatility, stochastic interest rates as well the dependency structure between all these processes explicitly into account.

40|$|International audienceDevelopment of {{starting}} system for synchronous motors of high-power mechanisms in mining and smelting industry, which enables proper starting characteristics and reasonable compensation of impact loads {{by means of}} synchronous drive. Mathematical modelling was applied for the determination of parameters of field winding with direct and indirect split and capacitors, {{as well as for}} substantiation of function of purpose choice and limiting the factors of influence for solving the problem of determination of field system parameters and springy mechanic components of synchronous drive. As based on the definite motor evidence, it was proved {{that it is possible to}} operate synchronous motors with split field winding and capacitors, which enable obtaining proper <b>starting</b> <b>characteristic</b> for the mechanism requirements. The needed installations for starting system and values of spring linkages rigidity for reasonable impact loads damping were also determined. The methods used enable determining parameters of field winding with indirect split and active-reactive resistance, as well as calculating the reasonable level of voltage forcing, time for field voltage reducing and order of elastic clutch rigidity under the conditions of design load increase. The use of new field windings enables start of high-power mechanisms and thus, prevents equipment from unplanned idle operation. It also makes it possible to improve productivity of operating mechanism by means of motor load increase in the stable operating mode, as well as improves drive energy characteristics. The peculiarity of electric circuit design for winding with direct split enables use of traditional technological process of pole coils production and does not require new production equipment. The use of field system with innovative control procedure and elastic clutch with the proper rigidity significantly decreases amortization of field windings and prevents emergency states of synchronous drive caused by dynamic impact overloads...|$|E
40|$|Helical Savonius rotor is {{considered}} to be superior to conventional Savonius rotor in terms of higher power coefficient (C p) and better <b>starting</b> <b>characteristic.</b> However studies related to helical Savonius rotors is few. In view of this, in this paper, the performance of a helical Savonius rotor with shaft at 45 ° bucket twist angle for one complete cycle of rotation was analyzed using Computational Fluid Dynamics. A two-bucket helical Savonius rotor with shaft was designed using GAMBIT, having a height of 60 cm and diameter of 17 cm with 45 ° bucket twist angle. A three dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics analysis using Fluent package was done to predict the performance of the rotor. Standard k-? turbulence model with second order upwind discretization scheme and standard wall condition was used. Grid independence test was also conducted to have the best meshing accuracy. Power coefficients (C p) of the rotor at different tip speed ratios were evaluated for rotor angle variation from 0 ° to 180 °. C p at each rotor angle increased with increase of tip speed ratio up to an optimum tip speed ratio, but then decreased even if tip speed ratio was further increased. Moreover, the effect of rotor angle on C p in a complete cycle of rotation was analyzed. C p was found to be positive at all rotor angles, and higher values of C p were obtained at rotor angles namely 45 °, 90 °, 225 ° and 270 °, which would contribute maximum power production by the rotor. In addition to these, flow physics of the rotor was studied using tangential velocity plots w. r. t. rotor angle and path lines across the rotor. It was found that at 45 °, 90 ° and 135 ° rotor angles, maximum concentration of the path lines near the tip of the blades in the upstream and downstream side of the rotor had occurred, which would be responsible for generation of maximum power coefficient in its clockwise rotation...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} the motor power required for providing the specified machine acceleration {{there is a}} need to know the relative start time. The known formulas are obtained by numerical integration of the <b>starting</b> <b>characteristics</b> of motors provided that the acceleration process ends when the motor accelerates to nominal speed. In real terms the acceleration process ends when the rotor speed corresponds to the static moment of friction forces. This paper provides numerical integration of the <b>starting</b> <b>characteristics</b> of asynchronous motors with the cage and wound rotor and presents curves of calculated relative start time, taking into account the static load. When calculating the required power of the motor, which runs in the mode of frequent starts and stops in the mechanisms that have high inertia loads and small moments of static resistance it is possible to use the motors of lower power and lower the dynamic loads at start-up a by virtue of a small increase in start-up time calculated by the above formulas.

40|$|For further {{improvements}} in the startup ability below freezing and the durability of polymer electrolyte fuel cells, understanding the ice formation mechanism during cold startup is particularly significant.
