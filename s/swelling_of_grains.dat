40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of a study on the process of moisture diffusion during barley grain storage in a grain storage silo. The moisture migration was caused by concentration gradient. The study was conducted using a model test station and consisted in the measurement of barley grain moisture and temperature in a silo, and in measuring the pressure exerted by the grain bulk on the silo wall. Analysis of the results showed that none of the parameters studied was stable. It was found that when the grain moisture content applied was 16 % in the bottom layer and 10 % in the upper layer the average value of grain moisture content in the silo increased from 13. 2 % to 14. 1 % over the ten days of the process, while with reverse positioning of the layers in the silo the corresponding increase reached 13. 8 %. This was due to additional precipitation of water {{in the course of the}} process of grain respiration. Moisture diffusion caused an increase in the temperature of the grain within the silo (up to 33 Ã‚Â°C at ambient temperature of 16 Ã‚Â°C). Another important effect of the moisture diffusion was the <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>grains,</b> which caused an increase in the pressure of the barley grain bulk against the silo wall. The highest increase in the wall load was observed at the boundary line between layers of grain of different moisture content levels. The changes in the values of the parameters under study were described by means of regression equations...|$|E

Two are for temperatures below gelatinisation temperatures, {{one of which}} incorporates the effects <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> the <b>grain.</b> A third model is presented for wetting <b>of</b> a <b>grain</b> at temperatures above gelatinisation, and hence cooking the grain. The models are developed as partial differential equations, and solved {{in a variety of}} ways. A model that ignores swelling at temperatures below gelatinisation is solved for wetting times by using the concept of mean action time, which reduces the problem to an exactly solvable linear Poisson equation. The other two models, which include swelling and cooking respectively, are solved approximately, taking advantage of the steep nonlinear diffusion fronts that develop. The aim of the modelling is to improve understanding of the cooking <b>of</b> whole <b>grain</b> cereals prior to processing into breakfast cereals.

The osmotic tensiometer (OT) has the potential to fulfil these demands but is still in an early stage of development. We have designed a novel OT that should overcome several drawbacks of former designs by the use of cross-linked polymeric gel <b>grains</b> instead <b>of</b> an aqueous solution of linear chain polymers inside the porous ceramic cup. For this reason, the cup can have large pores without polymer leakage. This ensures that water exchanges rapidly with the soil, resulting in a negligible pressure lag with changing temperatures, which is the most important source of a systematic measurement error of an OT. A second reason for better performance might be the inherent elasticity <b>of</b> the <b>grains</b> which should inhibit formation of a polymer cake at the filter. To study several of the key variables of the new sensor, transient and stationary experiments were performed in an aqueous solution the temperature, salt type and salt concentration of which were varied. Under similar conditions the <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> the polymer <b>grains</b> was studied in more detail.

25|$|Pollen {{apertures}} are {{regions of}} the pollen wall that may involve exine thinning or {{a significant reduction in}} exine thickness. They allow shrinking and <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> the <b>grain</b> caused by changes in moisture content. Elongated apertures or furrows in the pollen grain are called colpi (singular: colpus) or sulci (singular: sulcus). Apertures that are more circular are called pores. Colpi, sulci and pores are major features in the identification of classes of pollen. Pollen may be referred to as inaperturate (apertures absent) or aperturate (apertures present). The aperture may have a lid (operculum), hence is described as operculate. However the term inaperturate covers a wide range of morphological types, such as functionally inaperturate (cryptoaperturate) and omniaperturate. Inaperaturate pollen grains often have thin walls, which facilitates pollen tube germination at any position. Terms such as uniaperturate and triaperturate refer to the number of apertures present (one and three respectively).|$|R

Fourteen-day-old bean seedlings were cultured in a nutrient solution containing Cu 2 + at various concentrations (50 and 75 µM) for 3 days. Excess of copper significantly increased malondialdehyde content and endogenous H 2 O 2. This radical accumulated in the intercellular spaces of palisade mesophyll cells. In addition, cupric stress induced changes in antioxidant enzyme activities.

30|$|Heat stress {{alters the}} {{initiation}} {{and duration of}} developmental phases, especially the duration from floral/panicle initiation to anthesis/panicle exertion in plants (Sato et al. 1973). Heat stress during flowering and anthesis can lead to failure in fertilization due to pollen or ovule sterility (Matsui et al. 1997). Early reproductive processes viz., micro- and megasporogenesis, pollen and stigma viability, anthesis, pollination, pollen tube growth, fertilization, and early embryo development are all highly susceptible to heat stress (Giorno et al. 2013). Flowering stage is crucial for crop productivity as heat stress during this phase causes reduced pollen fertility and low seed set in rice (Jagadish et al. 2010 a). Anthesis processes, including anther dehiscence, pollination, and pollen germination are most sensitive to high temperature stress in rice. The main cause of spikelet sterility induced by high temperature is anther indehiscence (Matsui et al. 1999). High temperature inhibits <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> pollen <b>grains,</b> which is a driving force for anther dehiscence in rice. Successful anther dehiscence depends on several parameters, including rupturing of septa, expansion of locule walls, pollen <b>swelling,</b> and rupturing <b>of</b> stomium (Liu et al. 2006).|$|R

The limited experimental evidence {{that is available}} suggests that the main driver <b>of</b> the <b>swelling</b> in this material would be fission gases accumulation at crystalline grain boundaries. The steps {{that lead to the}} accumulation of fission gases at these locations are multiple and complex. However, gradually, the gaseous fission products migrate by diffusion. Upon reaching a grain boundary, which acts as a trap, the gaseous fission products start to accumulate, thus leading to formation of bubbles and hence to swelling. Therefore, a quantitative model <b>of</b> <b>swelling</b> requires the incorporation of phenomena that increase the presence <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> boundaries and decrease grain sizes, thus creating sites for bubble formation and growth.

60|$|When {{a partial}} cargo {{of any kind}} is taken on board, the whole, after being first stowed as compactly as may be, should be covered {{with a layer of}} stout shifting-boards, {{extending}} completely across the vessel. Upon these boards strong temporary stanchions should be erected, reaching to the timbers above, and thus securing every thing in its place. In cargoes consisting <b>of</b> <b>grain,</b> or any similar matter, additional precautions are requisite. A hold filled entirely with grain upon leaving port will be found not more than three fourths full upon reaching its destination--this, too, although the freight, when measured bushel by bushel by the consignee, will overrun by a vast deal (on account <b>of</b> the <b>swelling</b> <b>of</b> the <b>grain)</b> the quantity consigned. This result is occasioned by settling during the voyage, and is the more perceptible in proportion to the roughness of the weather experienced. If grain loosely thrown in a vessel, then, is ever so well secured by shifting-boards and stanchions, it will be liable to shift in a long passage so greatly as to bring about the most distressing calamities. To prevent these, every method should be employed before leaving port to settle the cargo as much as possible; and for this there are many contrivances, among which may be mentioned the driving of wedges into the grain. Even after all this is done, and unusual pains taken to secure the shifting-boards, no seaman who knows what he is about will feel altogether secure in a gale of any violence with a cargo <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> on board, and, least of all, with a partial cargo. Yet there are hundreds of our coasting vessels, and, it is likely, many more from the ports of Europe, which sail daily with partial cargoes, even of the most dangerous species, and without any precaution whatever. The wonder is that no more accidents occur than do actually happen. A lamentable instance of this heedlessness occurred to my knowledge in the case of Captain Joel Rice of the schooner Firefly, which sailed from Richmond, Virginia, to Madeira, with a cargo of corn, in the year 1825. The captain had gone many voyages without serious accident, although he was in the habit of paying no attention whatever to his stowage, more than to secure it in the ordinary manner. He had never before sailed with a cargo <b>of</b> <b>grain,</b> and on this occasion had the corn thrown on board loosely, when it did not much more than half fill the vessel. For the first portion of the voyage he met with nothing more than light breezes; but when within a day's sail of Madeira there came on a strong gale from the N. N. E. which forced him to lie-to. He brought the schooner to the wind under a double-reefed foresail alone, when she rode as well as any vessel could be expected to do, and shipped not a drop of water. Toward night the gale somewhat abated, and she rolled with more unsteadiness than before, but still did very well, until a heavy lurch threw her upon her beam-ends to starboard. The corn was then heard to shift bodily, the force of the movement bursting open the main hatchway. The vessel went down like a shot. This happened within hail of a small sloop from Madeira, which {{picked up one of the}} crew (the only person saved), and which rode out the gale in perfect security, as indeed a jolly boat might have done under proper management.|$|R
