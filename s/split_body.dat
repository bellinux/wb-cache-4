5000|$|The biconic is a sphere-cone with an {{additional}} frustum attached. The biconic offers a significantly improved L/D ratio. A biconic designed for Mars aerocapture typically has an L/D of approximately 1.0 compared to an L/D of 0.368 for the Apollo-CM. The higher L/D makes a biconic shape better suited for transporting people to Mars due to the lower peak deceleration. Arguably, the most significant biconic ever flown was the Advanced Maneuverable Reentry Vehicle (AMaRV). Four AMaRVs {{were made by the}} McDonnell-Douglas Corp. and represented a significant leap in RV sophistication. Three AMaRVs were launched by Minuteman-1 ICBMs on 20 December 1979, 8 October 1980 and 4 October 1981. AMaRV had an entry mass of approximately 470 kg, a nose radius of 2.34 cm, a forward frustum half-angle of 10.4°, an inter-frustum radius of 14.6 cm, aft frustum half angle of 6°, and an axial length of 2.079 meters. No accurate diagram or picture of AMaRV has ever appeared in the open literature. However, a schematic sketch of an AMaRV-like vehicle along with trajectory plots showing hairpin turns has been published.AMaRV's attitude was controlled through a <b>split</b> <b>body</b> flap (also called a [...] "split-windward flap") along with two yaw flaps mounted on the vehicle's sides.

The McDonnell Douglas DC-X (also a biconic) was essentially a scaled-up version of AMaRV. AMaRV and the DC-X also served as the basis for an unsuccessful proposal for what eventually became the Lockheed Martin X-33.|$|E

The seals and plug stem packing were designed to perform optimally in cryogenic temperature ranges. Unlike conventional high-pressure cryogenic valves, the trim size can be changed independent of the body. The design feature that provides flexibility for changing the trim is a <b>split</b> <b>body.</b> The body is divided into an upper and a lower section with the seat ring sandwiched in between. In order to maintain the plug stem packing at an acceptable sealing temperature during cryogenic service, heat-exchanging fins were added to the upper body section. The body is made of stainless steel. The seat ring is made of a nickel-based alloy having a coefficient of thermal expansion less than that of the body material. Consequently, when the interior of the valve is cooled cryogenically, the body surrounding the seat ring contracts more than the seat ring. This feature prevents external leakage at the body-seat joint. The seat ring has been machined to have small, raised-face sealing surfaces {{on both sides of the}} seal groove. These sealing surfaces concentrate the body bolt load over a small area, thereby preventing external leakage. The design of the body bolt circle is different from that of conventional highpressure control valves. Half of the bolts clamp the <b>split</b> <b>body</b> together from the top, and half from the bottom side. This bolt-circle design allows a short, clean flow path, which minimizes frictional flow losses. This bolt-circle design also makes it possible to shorten the face-toface length of the valve, which is 25. 5 in. (65 cm). In contrast, a conventional, high-pressure control valve face-to-face dimension may be greater than 40 in. (> 1 m) long...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the biological changes in bone density and bone modeling of the cortical bone when increasing the amount of cortical damage. Using a <b>split</b> <b>body</b> design, rabbit tibias were randomly allocated into a control group with one osteoperforation (OP) or experimental group with four OPs through the cortical bone. Two weeks prior to sacrifice. ?CT, Vickers Hardness microindentation, and histologic analyses were performed. The experimental bone was significantly less dense than the control bone up to 2. 0 mm away from the OPs after 2 weeks of healing. The Vickers hardness of the control bone was significantly harder than the experimental bone up to 3. 3 mm away from the OPs. The H&E sections of cortical bone showed greater amounts of woven bone within the OP site in the control specimen than in the experimental specimen after 2 weeks of healing while the experimental group had a greater amount of unmineralized fibrous tissue within the OP site. Added tissue was found on the periosteal and endosteal surfaces in both samples. The control group primarily had added woven bone while the experimental group primarily had added fibrous tissue, indicating an earlier stage of healing in the group with four OPs. There were areas of acellularity directly adjacent to the OPs in almost all of the control and experimental samples, which extended up to 0. 875 mm away from the OPs. TRAP staining indicated greater osteoclastic activity in the experimental group than the control group up to 1. 0 mm away from the OPs. In conclusion, greater cortical damage resulted in adjacent cortical bone that was less dense, less hard and had a higher degree of osteoclastic activity. The rate of healing was also slower with greater damage...|$|E

Emollients and topical corticosteroids are first line treatment of AE. As many caregivers have steroid phobia, alternative treatment options for mild AE are of interest. The aim of this small pilot study {{was to assess the}} potential effects and risks of applying fresh human milk locally on eczema spots in children with AE. Methods This was a <b>split</b> <b>body,</b> controlled, randomized and physician blinded pilot study, of children with AE with two similar contralateral eczema spots having a mother breastfeeding the child or a sibling. Fresh expressed milk and emollient was applied on the intervention spot and emollient alone on the control area, three times a day for four weeks. The severity and area of the eczema spots was evaluated weekly, and samples from milk and the spots were analysed weekly with respect to bacterial colonisation. Results Of nine patients included, six completed the study. Mean age at inclusion was 18. 5  months. The spots examined were localized on the arms, legs or cheeks. The spots were similar in severity, but differed in area. In one patient the eczema ceased after inclusion. In four patients both control and intervention areas increased during the intervention. The relative change in eczema area compared to baseline showed less increase in the intervention spots in two patients, whereas the opposite was observed in three. In four children Staphylococcus aureus was found in their eczema once or more. In three of the 28 human milk samples, Staphylococcus aureus, alfa haemolytic streptococci or coagulase negative staphylococci were detected. Staphylococcus aureus was found once both in human milk and in the eczema spots, no clinical signs of infection were however observed. No secondary infection due to milk application was detected. Conclusion In this small pilot study, no effect was found on eczema spots treated with topical application of fresh human milk. (ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier, NCT 02381028) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{mangrove}} killifish, Kryptolebias marmoratus, has {{the potential}} of becoming a strong model organism for a range of biological disciplines thanks to its ability to self-fertilise, a process only known to occur in invertebrate animals until its discovery. Selfing, a natural occurrence in this species, has lead to the formation of clonal lineages composed of highly homozygous individuals. The aim of this thesis was to further establish K. marmoratus in the field of developmental biology by providing an information infrastructure to help advance research on this peculiar animal and further promote its place in the pantheon of model organisms. To do so, I first set out to standardise K. marmoratus embryology by providing defined developmental stages with clear visual representations of key embryonic structures. This staging series is an essential tool that will ensure repeatability and consistency within and across different laboratories. Secondly, I examined several techniques for embryonic manipulation and for imaging {{that can be used in}} an array of experimental designs. Using these techniques I demonstrated microinjection of embryos by monitoring the yolk syncytial layer and its nuclei, and time-lapse analyses of the yolk surface during embryonic development. Finally, I applied the knowledge gained from my first two studies and examined Bmp signalling in K. marmoratus embryos and its influence on body patterning. By inhibiting this pathway, I found a new phenotype characterised by an extremely short and <b>split</b> <b>body</b> axis. These data highlighted the importance of studying known signalling pathways in unknown organisms as species-specific differences may improve our understanding of fundamental developmental processes. This thesis demonstrates that with its easily obtainable and manipulated embryos, K. marmoratus can be used for embryological research in the same light as other model organisms such as zebrafish or medaka. The rising amount of information on mangrove killifish will help further take advantage of this unique and intriguing species, and supports the use of this hermaphroditic vertebrate as a strong comparative model in developmental biology.

Thirty-six resistance-trained males (31. 0 +/- 8. 0 years, 179. 1 +/- 8. 0 cm, 84. 0 +/- 12. 9 kg, 17. 8 +/- 6. 6 %) followed a 4 days-per-week <b>split</b> <b>body</b> part resistance training program for 10 weeks. Three groups of supplements were randomly assigned, prior to the beginning of the exercise program, in a double-blind manner to all subjects: 48 g per day (g. d(- 1)) carbohydrate placebo (P), 40 g. d(- 1) of whey protein + 8 g. d(- 1) of casein (WC), or 40 g. d(- 1) of whey protein + 3 g. d(- 1) branched-chain amino acids + 5 g. d(- 1) l-glutamine (WBG). At 0, 5, and 10 weeks, subjects were tested for fasting blood samples, body mass, body composition using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), 1 repetition maximum (1 RM) bench and leg press, 80 % 1 RM maximal repetitions to fatigue for bench press and leg press, and 30 -second Wingate anaerobic capacity tests. No changes (p > 0. 05) were noted in all groups for energy intake, training volume, blood parameters, and anaerobic capacity. WC experienced the greatest increases in DEXA lean mass (P = 0. 0 +/- 0. 9; WC = 1. 9 +/- 0. 6; WBG = - 0. 1 +/- 0. 3 kg, p < 0. 05) and DEXA fat-free mass (P = 0. 1 +/- 1. 0; WC = 1. 8 +/- 0. 6; WBG = - 0. 1 +/- 0. 2 kg, p < 0. 05). Significant increases in 1 RM bench press and leg press were observed in all groups after 10 weeks. In this study, the combination of whey and casein protein promoted the greatest increases in fat-free mass after 10 weeks of heavy resistance training.

DESIGN: Comparison of two cross sectional investigations. Study sample All primary reports of randomised trials indexed in PubMed in December 2000 (n= 519) and December 2006 (n= 616), including parallel group, crossover, cluster, factorial, and <b>split</b> <b>body</b> study designs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The proportion of general and methodological items reported, stratified by year and study design. Risk ratios with 95 % confidence intervals were calculated to represent changes in reporting between 2000 and 2006. RESULTS: The majority of trials were two arm (379 / 519 (73 %) in 2000 v 468 / 616 (76 %) in 2006) parallel group studies (383 / 519 (74 %) v 477 / 616 (78 %)) published in specialty journals (482 / 519 (93 %) v 555 / 616 (90 %)). In both 2000 and 2006, a median of 80 participants were recruited per trial for parallel group trials. The proportion of articles that reported drug trials decreased between 2000 and 2006 (from 393 / 519 (76 %) to 356 / 616 (58 %)), whereas the proportion of surgery trials increased (51 / 519 (10 %) v 128 / 616 (21 %)). There was an increase between 2000 and 2006 {{in the proportion of}} trial reports that included details of the primary outcome (risk ratio (RR) 1. 18, 95 % CI 1. 04 to 1. 33), sample size calculation (RR 1. 66, 95 % CI 1. 40 to 1. 95), and the methods of random sequence generation (RR 1. 62, 95 % CI 1. 32 to 1. 97) and allocation concealment (RR 1. 40, 95 % CI 1. 11 to 1. 76). There was no difference in the proportion of trials that provided specific details on who was blinded (RR 0. 91, 95 % CI 0. 75 to 1. 10). CONCLUSIONS: Reporting of several important aspects of trial methods improved between 2000 and 2006; however, the quality of reporting remains well below an acceptable level.

40|$|Resistance {{training}} {{has been used}} extensively for improving muscle strength and athletic performance. Researchers have reported that training volume {{was one of the}} most important variables for improving strength and performance. This has been highlighted by greater performance improvements when performing three sets per exercise compared to a single set. Two commonly used training protocols are the full body (FB) and <b>split</b> <b>body</b> (SB) protocols, both of which have been used by athletes to improve training adaptations. However, very little research has directly compared the effects of FB and SB protocols. Muscle tissue growth is one important aspect of the adaptive process with testosterone (T), the main anabolic hormone, and cortisol (C), the primary catabolic hormone, being key contributors. Although many training studies have compared the effects of different protocols upon performance and hormones, none have been equated for training volume. Therefore, this study sought to examine the effects of two equi-volume training protocols (FB and SB) upon strength, body composition and hormones (resting T and C) in strength-trained males. Using a crossover study design, twenty four strength-trained males (mean 29. 8 ± 6. 8 years; mean 92. 9 ± 12. 2 kg) with a minimum of two years resistance training experience were randomly allocated into either a FB or SB training protocol. All subjects performed each protocol for four weeks separated by an eight-week wash-out period. Each training protocol involved three weekly workouts with the same number of sets and repetitions performed across each week. Rest periods were 60 seconds between sets and 90 seconds between exercises. Saliva samples were collected to assess the T and C responses to training. Body composition was assessed by skinfold assessments and maximal strength was determined by one repetition maximum (1 RM) assessments. Dependent t-tests were used to analyse within-group changes in the outcome variables, while independent t-tests were used to analyse the between-group differences in these variables. Statistical significance was set at an alpha level of p 0. 05) after both training protocol. There was also a significant difference (p < 0. 05) between training protocols observed for the Sal-T/C ratio. Both the FB and SB training protocols appeared to be effective during a four week training period with similar strength and body composition changes observed. There were differences in our hormonal data but these results may have been due to differences in baseline levels. Future research should address the possible effects of longer training periods using the same training protocols examined in this study. This analysis would provide a better understanding of the underlying stimulus for subsequent training adaptations. It also appears that using a high weekly training volume and training frequency (three or more training sessions per week) may provide a greater stimulus for muscle hypertrophy and strength improvements compared to performing one or two training sessions per week...|$|E
40|$|Masters of ScienceNampak {{packages}} {{millions of}} cans {{a year and}} {{a very small percentage of}} these cans fail due to many reasons. One of the main reasons that cause 2 - piece food cans to fail is split flanges. Split Flanges arises due to a number of reasons which will be discussed in detail. The focus of this thesis was based on the causes of split flanges in 2 -piece food cans. A study on manufacturing the steel and can making together with packaging fish in these cans was conducted. Another study on the reasons for split flanges occurring in 2 piece cans was conducted done as well. The purpose of the investigation was to check if hydrogen embrittlement could be the cause for <b>split</b> <b>bodies</b> forming in 2 piece food cans. 2 piece cans are drawn and wall ironed from tinplate; the cans were made up of a top and a shaped body. It was this shaped body that went through a considerable amount of stress during manufacture especially at the top of the can, which gave an explanation to why the cans split at the curved area near the flange of the can. According to previous studies done at Nampak R&D more complaints about <b>split</b> <b>bodies</b> were coming from the Fish canneries on the West Coast than the Vegetable canneries. These canneries used the exact same cans to package their product. The difference between the processes at these canneries was the exhaust boxes at the fish canneries. The exhaust box is a long tunnel filled with steam used to precook the fish; the vegetables are not precooked in exhaust boxes. Non metallic inclusions (NMI) was one of the main reason for these split flanges to occur and a reason of particular interest in this research. NMI’s were distributed throughout the steel of the cans and since the same cans were used for the fish and vegetable canneries, they should be failing at the same rate. Yet only complaints came from the fish canneries. So the primary focus of the research was to check if the additional steam process contributed to the formation of <b>split</b> <b>bodies</b> / flanges. We proposed to investigate if hydrogen atoms collect at grain boundaries, vacancies and non metallic inclusions and also to check if the steam accelerated embrittlement. Hydrogen is believed to penetrate right into the bare steel of the cans that were exposed to steam. Hydrogen atoms are being investigated because of their small size, their ability to diffuse through a metal lattice and form hydrogen molecules within the intermetallic vacancies of the metal. The molecules of hydrogen, once formed within the internal structure of the metal, remain trapped because of their larger size and can generate a significant pressure that can contribute to the formation of <b>split</b> <b>bodies.</b> [1] The first step to prove whether H-embrittlement was present in the cans was to check if hydrogen was present. A spectroscopic method namely, elastic recoil detection analysis (ERDA) was used to check if H could be detected using the Elastic Recoil Detection Analysis technique. Several experiments were designed to make sure the technique was suitable for the detection of H. Even though it is known that all metals are susceptible to corrosion and Hembrittlement, the tinplate metals had to be checked in an environment similar to the exhaust box (suspected area causing hydrogen embrittlement) in the factories. Further characterization was done using X-Ray Diffraction to measure the residual stress and relate it to the effects of H-embrittlement. If the H had penetrated into the metal it would cause some distortion in the atomic distances between the atomic planes in Fe atoms and can be measured using XRD. Another effect of hydrogen embrittlement is to reduce the strength in the metal. Tensile tests were performed to measure the strengths of the metal...|$|R

A escolha da referida base teórica para a abordagem do objeto em questão está pautada no interesse de distinguir uma nova interpretação que module o antagonismo entre as matrizes materialistas e idealistas que há muito discutem o tema. Mais estritamente, nossa abordagem atenta para as determinações epistêmicas que o paradigma moderno da realidade humana cindida em corpo e mente possibilita em relação às construções sócio-históricas em torno dos arrolamentos de poder no âmbito da escola e da Educação Física. Para tanto, estabelecemos, dentre outros, um diálogo com Thomas Popkewitz e Michel Foucault, principais autores que versam sobre o tema da epistemologia social e das relações de poder, respectivamente. Doravante, nosso trabalho discorre especificamente sobre a escola como dispositivo de poder que agencia seus ideais sócio-culturais sobre o solo da cisão entre corpo e mente. Mais ainda, detemo-nos no fato de a escola e a Educação Física utilizarem os saberes técnicos e tecnológicos desenvolvidos sob o paradigma da cisão, com o fim de incrementarem os agenciamentos de poder em prol de ajustes sócio-culturais concernentes aos modos de pensar (mente) e os modos de agir (corpo) do humano em geral e em particular. Por último, restou-nos fôlego para tratarmos o fenômeno esporte enquanto palco político e artefato de agenciamento dos saberes e dos poderes, pois tem a capacidade de assegurar operações diretas sobre os modos de vida da população em prol de propostas ideológicas que sobre a sociedade moderna procuram unilateralmente controlar os modos de subjetivação dos sujeitos individuais e coletivos.

The choice of the related theoretical basis to approach the object in question is focused in the interest to distinguish a new interpretation that modulates the antagonism between the materialistic and idealistic matrices that has been used to argue this subject for years. Particularly, our approach concerns to epistemic determinations that the modern paradigm of the human reality splited in body and mind enables in relation to the sociohistorical constructions around the power procedures in the scope of the school and the Physical Education. For in such a way, we establish, among others, a dialogue with Thomas Popkewitz and Michel Foucault, authors who turn on the social epistemology and the power relations, respectively. Furthermore, our work discusses specifically about the school as a power device that administrates its sociocultural ideals on the ground of the split between body and mind. Besides, we investigate the fact that school and Physical Education uses the technics and technological knowledges, developed under the dissension paradigm, in order to improve the power´s relation in favor to sociocultural adjustments related to humans ways about to think (mind) and to act (body), in a general and in a particular way. Finally, we discuss the phenomenon of the sport as a political stage and as a place where is possible to administrate knowledges and powers.
