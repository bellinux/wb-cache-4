5000|$|Slotted <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> are {{cylindrical}} pins rolled from a {{strip of}} material with a slot to allow the pin to have some flexibility during insertion. Slotted <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> are also known as roll pins or [...] "C" [...] pins.|$|E

50|$|When coiled <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> are installed, the {{compression}} {{starts at the}} outer edge and moves through the coils toward the center. Coiled pins continue to flex after insertion when a load {{is applied to the}} pin thus providing excellent performance to counter fatigue in dynamic applications. Coiled <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> were invented by Herman Koehl circa 1948.|$|E
50|$|During {{development}} it is {{not practical}} to solder BGAs into place, and sockets are used instead, but tend to be unreliable. There are two common types of socket: the more reliable type has <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> that push up under the balls, although it does not allow using BGAs with the balls removed as the <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> may be too short.|$|E
50|$|In {{engineering}} and machine design, a pin is a machine element that secures {{the position of}} two or more parts of a machine relative to each other. A large variety of types has been known for a long time; the most commonly used are solid cylindrical pins, solid tapered pins, groove pins, slotted <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> and spirally coiled <b>spring</b> <b>pins.</b>|$|E

5000|$|A {{development}} of the Geordie lamp was the Purdy. A galley with gauze provided the inlet, above the glass was a chimney with perforated copper cap and gauze outer. A brass tube protected the upper works, shielded them and kept them locked in position. A <b>sprung</b> <b>pin</b> locked the whole together. [...] The pin could only be released by applying a vacuum to a captive hollow screw; not something that a nicotine starved miner could do at the coal face.|$|R
50|$|The Five-seven is a {{semi-automatic}} delayed blowback pistol chambered for FN's 5.7×28mm ammunition. The pistol has {{a concealed}} hammer. Polymer materials are used {{extensively in the}} pistol's design, and even the steel slide is encased in a polymer shell. In addition to providing reduced weight and greater resistance to corrosion, this also prevents unwanted light reflection. The slide's polymer shell gives the pistol the appearance of being constructed entirely of polymers, but the slide interior, barrel, trigger, <b>springs,</b> <b>pins,</b> and similar parts are all steel. However, the pistol is unusually lightweight, weighing only 744 g (1.6 lb) with a loaded 20-round magazine.|$|R
5000|$|Heavy duty coiled <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> are {{typically}} used in high shear strength applications and hardened host materials.|$|E
5000|$|Standard duty coiled <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> {{offer the}} best balance between {{flexibility}} and strength and are recommended for most applications.|$|E
50|$|A {{spring pin}} (also called tension pin or roll pin) is a {{mechanical}} fastener that secures {{the position of}} two or more parts of a machine relative to each other. <b>Spring</b> <b>pins</b> have a body diameter which is larger than the hole diameter, and a chamfer on either one or both ends to facilitate starting the pin into the hole. The spring action of the pin allows it to compress as it assumes the diameter of the hole. The force exerted by the pin against the hole wall retains it in the hole, therefore a spring pin is considered a self retaining fastener. <b>Spring</b> <b>pins</b> are designed for use in double shear applications.|$|E

50|$|The manual pick gun (or snap gun) {{was invented}} by Ely Epstein. It usually has a trigger that creates a {{movement}} which (like bump keys) transfers sudden energy to the key pins which communicate this to the driver pins causing those pins only to jump, allowing the cylinder to turn freely for a brief moment, until the <b>pin</b> <b>springs</b> return the <b>pins</b> to their locking position. Electric versions are now also common, where by simply pressing a button the pins are vibrated while the normal torsion wrench is being used.|$|R

When the trigger {{is in the}} forward position, the firing <b>pin</b> <b>spring</b> remains lightly compressed (pre-cocked by the forward motion of the slide as it returns to battery). Pulling the trigger {{all the way to}} the back will compress the firing <b>pin</b> <b>spring</b> completely, draw the firing pin fully to the rear and position the trigger bar to release the firing pin and fire a round. The trigger travel is 4 mm with a pull weight of 25 N.|$|R
50|$|The Datach {{consists}} of a cartridge connection at its bottom, a central cartridge chamber on its back, with two spring-loaded pins on either side, which are pushed up when the unit is inserted into the Famicom, allowing the game to only be removed when the Datach {{has been removed from}} the Famicom. Its main feature is the card reading slot on the front. The cartridges resemble half-size Famicom cartridges. One side of the cartridge is flat with title sticker, while the other side is sloped inward with notches on the left and right, which correspond to the <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> on the main Datach unit. The cards that come with the games are swiped from left to right along the card slot; they are glossy on the front with an image of the character and the backs are smooth usually having the title of the game and barcode. All cartridges, boxes, instructions have the standard FF (Famicom Family) insignia, showing they are officially licensed by Nintendo.|$|E
40|$|Novel spring {{contactors}} {{were designed}} and characterized for wafer-level interposer and high-speed package test system applications, especially for wafer-level packages. These contactors {{can be used}} as replacement for vertical wafer probes as well as test sockets used in the final test. The contactor pin consists of a plunger section made of beryllium copper and a plated helical stainless steel spring wire. It is 5 mm in uncompressed total length, including the plunger and the spring. The overall diameter of the spring wire section was 0. 51 mm. The design of the contactor is much simpler and more scalable than that of traditional <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> called Pogo pins used in package tests. A test socket containing 36 contactor pins was constructed for tests and measurements. The experimental characterization shows $-$ 1 -dB bandwidth of 3. 73 GHz for 0. 8 -mm pitch, measured by the direct contact method. This experimental result correlates well with the simulated results. The rise time was 82 ps as measured by TDR, and the propagation delay was 23 ps. The electrical conduction path is through the pin and the spring, making it a reliable contact. However, the electrical path is known to be through the barrel, not the spring for the regular <b>spring</b> <b>pins...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{increased}} {{amount of}} traffic combined with higher traffic loads leads to many existing bridges needing strengthening {{in the future}} to ensure their expected lifespan. This means the bridge owners will be focusing more on strengthening projects and smart solutions will be crucial for preserving a healthy bridge stock. When strengthening existing non-composite bridges (with steel girder and concrete deck) one potential method is to achieve composite action by installing shear connectors. The post-installed shear connectors prevent slip between the steel girders and the concrete. The composite action will reduce bending stresses and deflection of the bridge, due to the increase in moment of inertia and relocation of the neutral axis. Different types of shear connectors can be used for achieving composite action and each type of connector has its own installation method. The biggest distinction between the methods is how the connectors gain access to the steel girder for installation and what technique is used when installing them. This thesis presents the theory behind composite action, the current methods used for achieving composite action on existing bridges and to what extent a bridge can be strengthened by composite action. The thesis also provides a status of the existing road bridge stock around the world. The four case studies examined in this thesis have used different post-installed shear connectors to manage different strengthening problems like weight restriction, fatigue life of shear connectors and a unique problem on the Pitsund Bridge where loud bangs appeared from the bridge when truck passed in the morning. For the case study on the Pitsund Bridge an interview was conducted that explains the entire procedure of the project, from the noise problem to how the installation of coiled <b>spring</b> <b>pins</b> was performed. The bridge over Lule River at Akkatsfallen consists of two steel girders and a concrete deck. This bridge is chosen as a real case study to determine to what extent a bridge can increase its capacity by achieving composite action. The calculations are performed in accordance with the Eurocodes on both non- and full-composite action and the result is compared to the other case studies...|$|E

Kick-up versions are rare and made with a cast aluminum upper trunk and the rudder is shorter than the standard, with a <b>spring</b> mounted <b>pin</b> which, when pulled, allows the rudder to tilt up 90 degrees, generally white fiberglass construction.|$|R
50|$|Changing {{the spring}} tension {{can help reduce}} bumping. A few sources inside the {{industry}} offer stronger top <b>springs</b> for conventional <b>pinned</b> locks.

2500|$|The slide {{features}} a spring-loaded claw extractor, and the stamped sheet metal ejector is {{pinned to the}} trigger mechanism housing. Pistols after 2002 have a [...] reshaped extractor {{that serves as a}} loaded chamber indicator. When a cartridge is present in the chamber, a tactile [...] metal edge protrudes slightly out immediately behind the ejection port {{on the right side of}} the slide. The striker firing mechanism has a spring-loaded firing pin that is cocked in two stages that the firing <b>pin</b> <b>spring</b> powers. The factory-standard firing <b>pin</b> <b>spring</b> is rated at , but by using a modified firing <b>pin</b> <b>spring,</b> it can be increased to [...] or to [...] When the pistol is charged, the firing pin is in the half-cock position. As the trigger is pulled, the firing pin is then fully cocked. At the end of its travel, the trigger bar is tilted downward by the connector, releasing the firing pin to fire the cartridge. The connector resets the trigger bar so that the firing pin will be captured in half-cock at the end of the firing cycle. This is known as a preset trigger mechanism, referred to as the [...] "Safe Action" [...] trigger by the manufacturer. The connector ensures the pistol can only fire semiautomatically.|$|R
50|$|The {{main reason}} for the program {{is the same for}} when the Colt M1911A1 was {{replaced}} by the Beretta M9 previously: the pistols were {{at the end of their}} service life and wearing out. All firearms have a finite life cycle. While parts such as the barrel, grips, <b>springs,</b> <b>pins,</b> and others can be replaced, the frame cannot and eventually becomes unserviceable. The M9, in service since the late 1980s, is approaching this limit. Examples in service are showing signs of terminal wear, and rather than replacing them with newly built M9s, the Army decided to opt for a new weapon to address design weaknesses. Special Forces use pistols more often and reach the end of the M9's service life relatively quickly, and regular troops are also reaching their handguns' lifecycle end through sheer age. Special operators have opted for other side arms like the SIG Sauer P226 and P228 (Navy SEALs) as well as the Glock 19 (Army Rangers) and Glock 22 (Delta Force). Conventional soldiers have problems with M9 features, or perceived lack thereof, including no accessory rail or suppressor attachment, an ergonomically poor grip, a heavy trigger pull, poor safety selector placement, and an open slide that lets in debris and can cause a malfunction.|$|R
