5|$|Although the {{hurricane}} season {{is defined as}} beginning on June1 and ending on November30, {{there have been several}} off-season storms. Since 1870, there have been 32 off-season cyclones, 18 of which occurred in May. In the same time span, nine storms formed in December, two in April, and one each in January, February and March. During four years (1887, 1953, 2003, and 2007), tropical cyclones formed in the North Atlantic Ocean both during or before May and during December. In 1887, four storms occurred outside the season, the most in a <b>single</b> <b>year.</b> High vertical wind shear and low sea surface temperatures generally preclude tropical cyclone formation during the off-season.|$|E

5|$|Evidence of {{large-scale}} Mesolithic nut processing, radiocarbon dated to circa 7000BC, {{has been found}} in a midden pit at Staosnaig on Colonsay. The dig discovered the remains {{of hundreds of thousands of}} burned hazelnut shells and gives an insight into communal activity and forward planning in the period. The nuts were harvested in a <b>single</b> <b>year</b> and pollen analysis suggests that the hazel trees were all cut down at the same time. The scale of the activity, unparalleled elsewhere in Scotland, and the lack of large game on the island, suggests the possibility that Colonsay contained a community with a largely vegetarian diet for the time they spent on the island.|$|E

5|$|Having been raided twice by the Mongols {{within a}} <b>single</b> <b>year,</b> Transylvania felt the {{consequences}} of the invasion of 12411242 for more than two decades. The administrative centers of the province, such as Alba Iulia and Cetatea de Baltă, had been destroyed. Due to the severe depopulation, a process of organized colonization commenced that lasted for several decades. For example, a new wave of colonization resulted in the establishment of the Saxon seats of Sighişoara and Mediaş; and the lord of Ilia received, in 1292, royal permission to settle Romanians in the lands he owned.|$|E

30|$|Our {{observation}} period from 1996 to 2010 contains two business cycles and thus several economic up- and downturns. 39 The first cycle comprises the years 1996 to 2003 {{and the second}} one starts in 2004. With these two cycles {{it is possible to}} investigate whether firms’ adjustment behavior has changed over time. For such an analysis I need to compare entire business cycles instead of <b>single</b> <b>years.</b> If two <b>single</b> <b>years</b> are compared, these two years could originate from different economic phases of the business cycle. This may lead to a comparison of employment adjustment in economic upturn (predominantly hirings) with that in economic downturns (predominantly firings). This could result in a difference in the estimated effects caused by asymmetry and not just because of a changing over time.|$|R
