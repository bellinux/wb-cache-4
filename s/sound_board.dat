25|$|The {{hurdy-gurdy}} is a {{stringed instrument}} that produces sound by a hand crank-turned, rosined wheel rubbing against the strings. The wheel functions {{much like a}} violin bow, and single notes played on the instrument sound {{similar to those of}} a violin. Melodies are played on a keyboard that presses tangentssmall wedges, typically made of woodagainst {{one or more of the}} strings to change their pitch. Like most other acoustic stringed instruments, it has a <b>sound</b> <b>board</b> and hollow cavity to make the vibration of the strings audible.|$|E
25|$|During the Renaissance, the {{hurdy-gurdy}} was a {{very popular}} instrument (along with the bagpipe) and the characteristic form had a short neck and a boxy body with a curved tail end. It was around this time that buzzing bridges first appeared in illustrations. The buzzing bridge (commonly called the dog) is an asymmetrical bridge that rests under a drone string on the <b>sound</b> <b>board.</b> When the wheel is accelerated, one foot of the bridge lifts from the soundboard and vibrates, creating a buzzing sound. The buzzing bridge {{is thought to have}} been borrowed from the tromba marina (monochord), a bowed string instrument.|$|E

500|$|As a young man, {{despite his}} dance talent, Sims {{aspired to be}} not a {{professional}} dancer, but a professional boxer. After twice breaking his hand, he decided he needed a different means of making a living. Sims had noticed that boxing audiences reacted positively {{to the way he}} would dance in the rosin box before getting into the ring, and especially to the distinctive sound his dancing made moving the rosin granules around the wooden box. He began to consider dancing as a career alternative. Sims experimented with several different methods of reproducing the rosin box effect, gluing sandpaper to either his shoes or his dancing mat, but the sandpaper created too much wear on the other surface. Finally he found the solution: loose sand in a low-lipped box. [...] "People went for the scraping sound... So I made a <b>sound</b> <b>board</b> by sprinkling sand on a flat platform. That was in 1935." [...] His sandbox remained his trademark throughout his career, with some venues even telling Sims, [...] "If you don't bring your sandbox, don't come at all." ...|$|E

He concluded the film was [...] "a member of the so-corny-its-good genre," [...] while [...] "Arnold delivers plenty of one-liners ripe for <b>sound</b> <b>board</b> crank callers." [...] Jamie Malanowski of The New York Times praised the film's satirical premise but felt it was [...] "full of unrealized potential" [...] because [...] "the filmmakers [...] equate mayhem with humor." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film two-and-a-half stars, writing that he [...] "liked {{a lot of the}} movie", which he thought had [...] "energy" [...] and humor which would have mass audience appeal. He was, though, disappointed by [...] "its relentlessly materialistic view of Christmas, and by the choice to go with action and (mild) violence over dialogue and plot." [...] Kevin Carr of 7M Pictures concluded that while the film is not very good, as a form of family entertainment it is [...] "surprisingly fun." ...|$|E
500|$|The Saturn's design {{elicited}} mixed commentary among game {{developers and}} journalists. Developers quoted by Next Generation in December 1995 described the Saturn as [...] "a real coder's machine" [...] for [...] "those {{who love to}} get their teeth into assembly and really hack the hardware", with [...] "more flexibility" [...] and [...] "more calculating power than the PlayStation". The Saturn's <b>sound</b> <b>board</b> was also widely praised. By contrast, Lobotomy Software programmer Ezra Dreisbach described the Saturn as significantly slower than the PlayStation, whereas Kenji Eno of WARP observed little {{difference between the two}} systems. In particular, Dreisbach criticized the Saturn's use of quadrilaterals as its basic geometric primitive, in contrast to the triangles rendered by the PlayStation and the Nintendo 64. Ken Humphries of Time Warner Interactive remarked that compared to the PlayStation, the Saturn was markedly worse at generating polygons but markedly better at sprite-based graphics. Third-party development was initially hindered by the lack of useful software libraries and development tools, requiring developers to write in assembly language to achieve good performance. During early Saturn development, programming in assembly could offer a two-to-fivefold speed increase over higher-level languages like C.s number crunching was handled by four serial DSPs that were way too costly to be included in any home system. Sega's consequent development of the SH-2 meant that it could also produce a Saturn-compatible arcade system.}} The Saturn hardware is considered extremely difficult to emulate. Sega responded to complaints about the difficulty of programming for the Saturn by writing new graphics libraries which were claimed to make development easier. Sega of America also purchased a United Kingdom-based development firm, Cross Products, to produce the Saturn's official development system. Despite these challenges, Treasure CEO Masato Maegawa stated that the Nintendo 64 was more difficult to develop for than the Saturn. Traveller's Tales' Jon Burton opined that while the PlayStation was easier [...] "to get started on... you quickly reach [...] limits", whereas the Saturn's [...] "complicated" [...] hardware had the ability to [...] "improve the speed and look of a game when all used together correctly." [...] A major point of criticism was the Saturn's use of 2D sprites to generate polygons and simulate 3D space. The PlayStation functioned in a similar manner, but also featured a dedicated [...] "Geometry Transfer Engine" [...] that rendered additional polygons. As a result, several analysts described the Saturn as an [...] "essentially" [...] 2D system.|$|E

2500|$|Like {{several other}} bands during this time, the Grateful Dead allowed their fans {{to record their}} shows. For many years the tapers set up their {{microphones}} wherever they could, and the eventual forest of microphones became {{a problem for the}} official sound crew. Eventually, this was solved by having a dedicated taping section located behind the <b>sound</b> <b>board,</b> which required a special [...] "tapers" [...] ticket. The band allowed sharing of tapes of their shows, as long as no profits were made on the sale of their show tapes. Sometimes the sound crew would allow the tapers to connect directly to the <b>sound</b> <b>board,</b> which created exceptional concert recordings.|$|E

2500|$|The {{hammered}} dulcimer is a percussion-stringed instrument {{which consists}} of strings typically stretched over a trapezoidal resonant <b>sound</b> <b>board.</b> The hammered dulcimer is set before the musician, who, in more traditional styles, may sit cross legged on the floor, or at a more modern style of standing or sitting at a wooden stand on legs. The player holds a small spoon shaped mallet hammer in each hand to strike the strings (cf. Appalachian dulcimer). The Graeco-Roman dulcimer (sweet song) derives from the Latin dulcis (sweet) and the Greek melos (song). The dulcimer, in which the strings are beaten with small hammers, originated from the psaltery, in which the strings are plucked.|$|E

2500|$|Today, {{the image}} of the harp is used on the coins, {{passports}} and official seals of Ireland and is incorporated into the emblems of many bodies in Northern Ireland, such as the Police Service of Northern Ireland. The harp is frequently incorporated into the emblems of Irish companies, [...] such as Guinness and Ryanair. It appears on the arms of countries with historical links to Ireland or the United Kingdom, such as Montserrat and Canada. In 1984, exemplars of the modern design, approved by the Chief Herald, were registered by the Government of Ireland with the World Intellectual Property Organization under Article 6ter of the Paris Convention, which relates to state emblems. The government only registered [...] "left-facing" [...] images, with the harp's <b>sound</b> <b>board</b> on the right.

2500|$|In a 1986 {{speaking}} engagement at the University of Georgia, Max Weinberg (drummer for the E Street Band) stated that [...] "Born in the U.S.A." [...] was his all-time favorite song that the band had recorded. Later, {{in a separate}} question and answer session, Weinberg explained {{that it was his}} favorite because the song was not written in advance for the various instrumental parts. After a grueling studio session while members of the band were in the booth at the <b>sound</b> <b>board,</b> one member of the band at a time returned to the recording area joining in to make up their own new parts to the song that had been intended as an acoustic guitar-only song. Even Springsteen came out and started singing vocals. It sounded so good that they did it again and recorded it. Without reviewing the recording, Springsteen said, let's do that one more time. So they recorded the second take (or the third time the unwritten version had ever been played). That second studio take was the CD release on the Born in the U.S.A. album.|$|E
2500|$|Multiple outputs - The professional-level modules {{from the}} leading {{manufacturers}} have multiple outputs to the <b>sound</b> <b>board</b> such that each percussion group (i.e. Toms, Cymbals, etc...) can be independently mixed (like the multiple miking of an acoustic kit). [...] Additionally, these groups have independent volume faders on the module to fine-tune volume settings for each group. Another commonly designated output is the MIDI connection, which sends signals {{to a computer}} based specialist MIDI software or, for example, a DAW (digital audio workstation). The increased processing power provided by this option allows the user to utilize actual, randomized samples of professionally recorded [...] or modeled drums. [...] The output and input of the pads, trigger devices etc. can be augmented or controlled through digital software, the module, MIDI instruments and other samplers. [...] The result is a phenomenally credible, nuanced, flexible set of instruments and, arguably, by some accounts; an almost indistinguishable augmentation or replacement for traditionally recorded drums and melodic/world percussion and effects. [...] Not many acoustic drummers will warm to that, and many studio engineers will quibble about the finer audio details regarding acoustic vs electronic, {{but that is not}} the scope of the article.|$|E

A 2 ̆ 2 Test Bed 2 ̆ 2 will act as a venue for the visible redesign of existing courses in ways that employ authentic learning and assessment activities [...] where students do real-world engineering in the classroom. The redesigned courses will also help students inbound into their community of professional practice 3, 4. Project mentors drawn from a local professional engineering organization will help students to complete projects, and online webinars/live lectures will bring practicing engineers and other experts into the classroom. These instructional approaches should increase the number of activities and beliefs that support student entry into their community of engineering practice. This poster session provides in-progress results of a literature review identifying factors and potential measures facilitating entry into this community of practice. As courses are redesigned in the Test Bed, the <b>Sounding</b> <b>Board</b> will provide guidance and feedback on deliverables arising from the course redesigns, such as job-focused objectives, active learning strategies, authentic assessments, rubrics, and prototypes illustrating key instructional components.
