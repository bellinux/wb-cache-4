25|$|Though some variant bonuses or {{penalties}} {{are based}} on the contract score, normally a bonus or penalty does not affect and is not affected by any other bonus or penalty, or the contract score. As a result, a partnership can have a net positive score even if they failed to make their contract. For instance, if one player successfully made a Nil bid, but their partner bid 5 tricks and only took 4 tricks, the partnership <b>still</b> <b>gets</b> the bonus which is represented as −50 points + 100 points = 50 points. Conversely, a partnership can have a net negative score in much the same way; if a player failed a nil bid but the partnership bid and took 5 tricks, the net score is −50 points.|$|E
25|$|Cape Breton Island {{is notable}} for its mining industry. When explorers and {{settlers}} arrived {{here in the}} 17th and 18th centuries, they were focused on the coal, which was discovered in rocks and cliffs. Coal was used to heat houses and factories, used by blacksmiths to mold iron, and for the steam engines of trains. Coal was extracted principally in the Sydney–Glace Bay area of Cape Breton Island, until the mines were closed in 2001. Many mines have shut down as coal becomes a less popular fuel. Despite this, Nova Scotia <b>still</b> <b>gets</b> most of its electricity from coal, most of which is now imported. Some of Cape Breton's mines have been turned into tourist attractions and museums, and retired miners take people on tours of old mines.|$|E

Another {{member of the}} office is the useless Clive (Tom George) or as Martin calls him, 'young, er, thing', who often turns publicity stunts into bloodbaths.

However, it criticised the script and narrative for being trite, saying that [...] "all it promises is some fun moments, a peppy music score by Vishal-Shekhar, [...] alluring performances by Ranbir and Priyanka". Subhash K. Jha wrote another positive review, saying that the film [...] "sets off a tender saucy engaging trip. It somewhere loses its way. But <b>still</b> <b>gets</b> to its targeted destination because of the lead players who appear to know all the signposts and U-turns." [...] He particularly cited Chopra's performance as redeeming the film's flaws, noting that she provided a strong match to Kapoor's talent.

500|$|The song has {{received}} generally positive reviews from most music critics. Sam Lanksy of Idolator gave the song a favorable review, calling it [...] "an emotional ballad that shows off Mars’ sweet vocals." [...] Lansky also praised it, naming it [...] "another exceptional offering from Unorthodox Jukebox, which {{is shaping up}} {{to be one of the}} year’s best pop releases." [...] Andrew Unterberger of Pop Dust gave the song a rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars, commenting that 'When I Was Your Man' is [...] "a much more satisfying, less ostentatious ballad than 'Young Girls'— though maybe the lyrics are a little too clichéd to result in a classic soul ballad the way Bruno seems to be going for." [...] However, he praised Mars, which according to him, [...] "nobody puts a song like this over quite like him, and when he hits the big high note on the song’s bridge, it’s about as striking a moment as you’re likely to hear on a pop record this year. It might be a little too perfect to be as devastating as a song like 'Someone Like You', but it might be a big hit just the same, and it’s guaranteed to absolutely slay in a live set." [...] Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly was positive, writing that [...] "Old-school charm <b>still</b> <b>gets</b> Mars the furthest, and the best thing here is the classic torch song 'When I Was Your Man', which finds him at the piano listing all the ways he wronged an ex. 'Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life,' he cries in his Sinatra-smooth tenor, oozing charm. Maybe he's a jerk. But he's the jerk that girl's going home with tonight." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "All the Lovers" [...] {{was directed by}} Joseph Kahn, {{who is known for}} having previously collaborated with American recording artist Britney Spears on the videos for her singles [...] "Toxic" [...] and [...] "Womanizer". It was filmed in Downtown Los Angeles, the central business district of Los Angeles, California, in early May 2010. Aiming to pay [...] "homage" [...] to her large gay audience, Minogue wanted the video to express [...] "what I'm about and what I love" [...] and thus it was made to depict scenes of same-sex kissing. Arts and culture magazine BlackBook reported that the video, which portrays a large group of underwear-clad men and women, is a re-imagination of the installations of Spencer Tunick, an American photographer known for organising large-scale nude shoots. Minogue credited Kahn for the idea behind the video, saying [...] "He came up with a brilliant, simple idea and executed it so sensitively, I thought. It's still cutting edge, it <b>still</b> <b>gets</b> you a little hot under the collar, but I think there's a real sensitivity." [...] Initially, two ideas for the storyline arose, one which was a [...] "little gentler" [...] and one which was [...] "edgier", and in the end the latter option was finalised. When Kahn submitted his cut of the video to Parlophone, a person working for the label refused to release it and wanted a new one to be shot. However, at Minogue's interference the video was finally commissioned and released. A preview of the video was released on 25 May 2010 while the full version was premiered five days later. It was made available to download at the iTunes Store on 11 June 2010. In 2011, Kahn talked about working with Minogue and called her the [...] "dream artist to work with" [...] and a [...] "joy to photograph", praising her ability to [...] "understand" [...] directors. He further commented that: [...] " [...] is one of my favourite videos I did last year, and one of my favourites ever really. The message Kylie wanted to say with this video is important, and I am lucky to have worked with her on it." ...|$|E

Gadibia dies the following day, the Elders having poisoned his drink the previous night. Peter (OC Ukeje), Gadibia's son, to whom he has already confessed, explains the incident to Ebiere and how sure he is that his father was murdered by the Elders. Gadibia's stolen fund is discovered in his house and the other elders involved are captured by the community people, led by Ebiere. Ebiere wants the Elders to be reported to the police, but the people refuse to listen and set them ablaze instead. Everyone at the vicinity of the crime is arrested by the Police; Ebiere however claims responsibility for the crime and is sentenced to death by hanging. The film shifts back to the present in the Los Angeles tunnel; Tom Hudson calls Nigeria's Head of State and tells him to do something to stop the execution of Ebiere, but his request isn't granted. Angela (Vivica Fox) of the US Anti-terrorism unit advises that the United States make a diplomatic call to the Nigerian Government, but the head of the department says they do not negotiate with terrorists. They eventually resolve to issue a deceptive press release, stating that Ebiere has been released. When the emancipation movement is informed about the release, they drop their weapons as a result and also release the rest of the hostages, including Tom Hudson. They are arrested by the United States Police, while Ebiere <b>still</b> <b>gets</b> hanged in Nigeria.|$|E
