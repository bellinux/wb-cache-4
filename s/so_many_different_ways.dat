25|$|Opitz {{argues that}} the binding of {{different}} brain areas is mediated by the hippocampus. Relational bindings, or relationships between separate objects, concepts, and memories, are very flexible because the targets can be combined in <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways</b> {{to deal with the}} present situation, and the hippocampus ensures that these parts are arranged into a coherent whole. Particularly, the hippocampus has been implicated in binding that is involved with episodic memory, working memory, and language acquisition. According to Opitz, this is viable because the hippocampus meets all criteria to be suitable for the regulation relational binding and, based on its patterns of activity, it is likely that it is involved.|$|E

[...] Wyman added, [...] "Yeah, it was important. I mean, you know, for people that say it was just a diversion, well, there was something really important involved in that Walter/William relationship. That was part of Walter’s self-actualization, that moment when William Bell says, 'Look, you have to be on your own. You have to walk the path that you believe in. You gain some humility where there once was hubris, and it’s really important that you depend on yourself.' Part of our plan has always been to get Walter to embrace his flaws and uniqueness as strengths, rather than thinking of them inhibiting his performance as a scientist and as a character. We were really anxious to get that across, and the best person to do that for us was William Bell, because Walter depended so much on William in <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways.</b> So that story came around at a time where we really needed to have it."

This paper provides a general evaluation of this situation. Firstly it shows that the theoretical concepts of classical genetics cannot be correlated unambiguously with the theoretical concepts of molecular genetics. In fact, there is no agreement on such simple questions as: Where are the genes? When do they exist? What are they? How many? Secondly, it provides an interpretation of why biologists continue to use the word 'gene'. Three complementary explanations are proposed: scientific communication, economical stakes, and struggle for scientific authority among biological discipline...|$|R
40|$|Globally, {{the call}} for impact of science on society is louder than ever. The Netherlands is no exception. In 2004, {{valorisation}} was introduced as a core element of Dutch science policy, aiming to increase the societal benefits of academic research. In scientific practice, the introduction of valorisation meant scientists got a new task, in addition to teaching and education. This thesis studies the valorisation policy from a principal-agent perspective. It aims to answer two questions. 1) How has the valorisation policy of Dutch government been translated to academic practice in the Netherlands between 2004 and 2014 ? And 2) How can societal benefits of academic research be evaluated? Scientists from a multitude of disciplines have been interviewed and surveyed and policy documents have been studied. The first key {{result is that the}} Dutch science system is in a transition. Scientists are motivated to engage with society and do <b>so</b> in <b>many</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways.</b> However, they have a limited understanding of valorisation policies and feel poorly equipped for the task. The second key result is that valorisation should be evaluated as a process. This facilitates learning among scientists and as such allows for improving valorisation practices. The study ends with policy recommendations. Promotor: P. F. Wouters. Co-promotor: I. C.

The Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra refers to a true self. [...] "The Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṅa Sūtra, especially influential in East Asian Buddhist thought, {{goes so far as to}} speak of it as our true self (ātman).

[...] Paul Williams states: [...] " [...] it is obvious that the Mahaparinirvana Sutra does not consider it impossible for a Buddhist to affirm an atman provided it is clear what the correct understanding of this concept is, and indeed the sutra clearly sees certain advantages in doing so."

40|$|THESIS 7385 In the 1930 s Ireland {{grasped the}} {{opportunity}} to define itself as a modern free state and the decade is thus {{one of the most}} dynamic in Ireland?s history since Independence. Within the space of ten years, Fianna Fail came to power, the IRA were banned, an economic war occurred, the Senate was dissolved and the Constitution was rewritten. Crucially, this was a transitional period for Irish national identity as Irish nationalism was no longer anti-establishment but, rather, in a new position of authority and power. It is not surprising, therefore, to find in the thirties an equally dynamic cultural tradition as writers, artists and film-makers responded to the conditions of the time. Much of this response is critical of the emerging modern state or prescriptive in tone and it is this relationship between filmic and dramatic culture and the Irish state that will form the main focus of this thesis. The plays and films discussed here are representative {{of a wide range of}} attitudes, both conservative and subversive, and though they often share the desire to critique the Free State, they do <b>so</b> in <b>many</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways</b> and from <b>different</b> political perspectives.

40|$|Due to women’s {{increased}} {{participation in}} the labour force, more and more family-households are now juggling paid labour and care-giving {{in space and time}} and do <b>so</b> in <b>many</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways.</b> Much research and policy about how households try to establish a satisfactory work-life balance single out particular coping strategies, such as telecommuting or the mobilizing of informal help by relatives or friends. While insightful, foregrounding single strategies may oversimplify the complex reality of everyday life, in which people often skilfully weave together multiple coping strategies. As well, advances in information and communication technologies (ICTs) have further diversified the arsenal of possible coping strategies, but the academic literature has yet to verify whether ICT usage complements or substitutes the adoption of other coping strategies. Adopting a holistic quantitative approach this study assesses which combinations of coping strategies prevail and which role ICTs play in this regard among one- and dual-earner households in the Utrecht-Amersfoort-Hilversum area, the Netherlands. We also examine systematic variations in strategy combination by socio-demographics, ICT possession, affordability and skills, social network factors, employment and commute factors, spatial factors, lifestyle orientation and other factors. We identify several distinct combinations of strategies and find that ICT-related strategies are frequently adopted by highly educated employed parents in the Netherlands attempting to achieve a satisfying work-life balance and tend to complement other types of strategies. Which combinations of strategies have been adopted depends most strongly on the presence of young children, but also on employment factors and characteristics of the environment surrounding the dwelling and main workplace...|$|R
