5|$|Muncy Creek {{begins in}} southeastern Laporte Township, Sullivan County, near its border with Davidson Township, Sullivan County. The creek flows <b>southwest</b> <b>and</b> then west {{for a short}} {{distance}} before reaching the border between Laporte Township and Davidson Township. It then turns southwest as it begins to follow this border. Shortly afterwards it turns northwest and begins to flow into a valley, then turns west and begins receiving very short tributaries from both sides. Examples of these include Rock Run and Lopez Pond Branch. After picking up Peters Creek, one such tributary, Muncy Creek turns <b>southwest</b> <b>and</b> passes the community of Nordmont, where the tributary Elklick Run flows into it. The creek then turns <b>southwest</b> <b>and</b> later west. Deep Hollow Run then enters the creek, which heads south away from the Laporte Township/Davidson Township border. Upon leaving behind the Laporte Township/Davidson Township border, the creek enters Davidson Township and heads west-southwest, passing a gauging station. After several miles, it reaches the community of Sonestown, where the tributary Big Run flows into it from the north. Muncy Creek then makes a sharp bend south and begins flowing parallel to U.S. Route 220. After a few miles, it passes the community of Muncy Valley and makes a sharp turn south, exiting Davidson Township.|$|E
