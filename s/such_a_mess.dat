He promised {{to put an end}} to the Russian Hockey Federation's history of internal conflict and player boycotts, saying, [...] "You won't see <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>mess</b> with the national team that you've seen here before," [...] and that [...] "You won't see grouchy players here anymore. Only those who really want to play for Russia will be called into the team." [...] As general manager, Bure chose the team for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. The Russians failed to win a medal, losing to the Czech Republic in the bronze medal match. Leading up to the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, former Soviet national goaltender Vladislav Tretiak was named Bure's successor as Olympic general manager.|$|E

According to Outlook, [...] "Hud Bannon is a mean, unscrupulous man who never has even a momentary twinge of conscience or change of heart"; in the end scene, Hud [...] "ulls down the shade on the world of goodness and decency".

500|$|Journalist Catherine Putz {{commented on}} the phrase in a 2016 article for the {{international}} news magazine The Diplomat, and compared it to use of whataboutism by businessman and politician Donald Trump: [...] "Criticisms {{of human rights in}} the Soviet Union were often met with what became a common catchphrase: 'And you are lynching Negroes'." [...] She pointed out the folly of its use: [...] "It demands, by default, for a state to argue abroad only in favor of ideals it has achieved the highest perfection in." [...] Writing for the liberal Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Israeli journalist Chemi Shalev made a similar comparison: [...] "Trump told the New York Times this week that America is in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>mess</b> in terms of civil liberties that it cannot lecture foreign countries anymore, which is an echo of old Soviet propaganda that responded to American reprimands with the retort 'And you are lynching Negroes'." [...] Shalev followed-up on this analysis in a subsequent article, writing: [...] "Trump conducts pro-Russian propaganda along the same lines as the old retort 'And You Hang Blacks' with which the Soviets tried to deflect U.S. criticism of their human rights abuses. He isn't troubled by Putin's political opponents being murdered, because 'people get killed here too'." [...] Writing for ChinaFile after Trump won the 2016 U.S. election, James Palmer feared an increase in racism [...] "would give a brutal new credibility to the old Soviet whataboutism whenever they were challenged on the gulag: 'But in America, you lynch Negroes'." [...] In her work Security Threats and Public Perception, Elizaveta Gaufman characterized the phrase as a form of reversing someone's line of reasoning against them. Gaufman wrote that by using this phrase in an argument, one was tacitly refusing to answer queries posted to them and instead responding with condemnations.|$|E

He appealed for a reduced sentence, and in February 2005 he was re-sentenced to fourteen {{months in prison}} and ordered to pay the victim 190,000 NOK (about 30,400 US$) in compensation. The incident happened in February 2002 during a late-night party at Gaahl's house in Espedal, when he became involved in a confrontation {{with a man who}} arrived at his house. Gaahl was accused of severely beating the man, collecting his blood into a cup and threatening to make him drink it. Gaahl said [...] "I {{was the one who was}} attacked, but they think I punished him too hard. As I always say, when people cross my line and I let them know where the line is many steps before they cross it, and still they choose to cross it, then I will be the one to decide what their punishment will be". He also claimed to have given the man the cup [...] "so that he would not make <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>mess</b> in my house with all the blood". In March 2006, Gaahl recorded vocals for Gorgoroth's next album, Ad Majorem Sathanas Gloriam. According to band members, he was in prison from April to December 2006.|$|E

2500|$|... "She's a Mess" [...] is an uptempo electropop song. Originally called [...] "I'm a Mess", {{the group}} decided to retitle it due to {{concerns}} that the lyrics (such as [...] "Drinking bottle after bottle / I'm <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>mess</b> in that dress / I'm not impressed") encouraged binge drinking. However, Range stated that [...] "there are some lyrics that are quite cheeky but people shouldn't take them seriously." [...] During an interview for Digital Spy, Berrabah described the overall sound of Sweet 7, saying: [...] "It's quite an uptempo album {{with a lot of}} different sounds." [...] Berrabah cited [...] "She's a Mess" [...] as an example for this, which she said was [...] "just totally different from everything else." [...] Jon O'Brien of AllMusic wrote that the [...] "aptly named 'She's a Mess' is a chaotic attempt at a Clubland trance-pop floor-filler". Al Fox of the British Broadcasting Corporation called the song, along with the album's third single [...] "Wear My Kiss", a [...] "glimmer of brilliance" [...] and {{went on to say that}} it is saved by Berrabah's [...] "unashamed attitude". Christopher Lee of The Scotsman named it one of the better tracks on the album, although admitted that it [...] "wouldn't have sounded much different coming from any other girl band". Nick Levine of Digital Spy wrote that [...] "sisterhood" [...] is being [...] "jettisoned entirely" [...] on the track, which he described as [...] "crass and misogynistic". Celina Murphy of Hot Press suggested that [...] "She's a Mess" [...] "might actually sound quite punchy" [...] if it was recorded by Barbadian recording artist Rihanna.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the fourth}} Test of their five-Test {{series against the}} West Indies in 1966, England were 3–0 down and had lost the series. Needing someone {{to come in to}} {{revitalise}} the squad, the England selectors turned to the successful Yorkshire captain, Brian Close. Close knew why he had been selected, and also why many of his men had been. At the pre-match dinner he said, [...] "I shouldn't be here if we hadn't made <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>mess</b> of the series. What's more, neither would a few of you. You are here because you are all fighters, {{and we are going to}} keep the pressure on and keep it on for five days." [...] What Close did was to engender a battling spirit for the final Test Match. So, when England were 166 for 7 in reply to the West Indies' 268 all out, they did not give up. Instead, centuries from Tom Graveney and John Murray, and half-centuries from Ken Higgs and John Snow, saw England to a score of 527. The highlight of the match was when West Indian captain Gary Sobers, who had a batting average in the series of well over 100, came in to bat at 137 for 5 with his side still 122runs from making England bat again. Close knew that Sobers was a fine hooker, and he knew how he wanted to approach him, so he asked Snow to bowl a bouncer first up. Everything went to plan: Sobers hooked, edged the ball into his body, and it rebounded to Close at his customary short leg position, close to the batsman, ready to take the catch – or a full blow to the body had Sobers middled it. Sobers c. Close, b. Snow 0 off one ball. England went on to win the game by an innings and 34 runs.|$|E
