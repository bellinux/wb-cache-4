These were built on the Muslim tradition of a communitarian ethic on the one hand, and responsible individual conscience with freedom to negotiate one's own moral commitment and destiny on the other. In 1905 he ordained the first Ismā'īlī Constitution for the <b>social</b> <b>governance</b> of the community in East Africa. The new administration for the Community's affairs was organised into a hierarchy of councils at the local, national, and regional levels. The constitution also set out rules in such matters as marriage, divorce and inheritance, guidelines for mutual cooperation and support among Ismā'īlīs, and their interface with other communities. Similar constitutions were promulgated in India, and all were periodically revised to address emerging needs and circumstances in diverse settings.|$|E

We examine the three factors separately to disentangle the relation of each with performance. We find {{no difference in the}} performance of firms with high or low environmental, <b>social</b> or <b>governance</b> rankings. The firms also do not differ in their systematic risks, book-to-market ratios or momentum exposures. However, high-rated firms are consistently larger. Our findings demonstrate that UK investors can incorporate environmental, <b>social</b> or <b>governance</b> criteria into their investment strategies without incurring any significant cost (or benefit) in terms of risk or return.

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to propose a model for {{measuring}} sustainable value which would complexly assess environmental, <b>social,</b> and corporate <b>governance</b> contribution to value creation. In the paper {{the concept of the}} Sustainable Environmental, <b>Social</b> and Corporate <b>Governance</b> Value Added is presented. The Sustainable Environmental, <b>Social</b> and Corporate <b>Governance</b> Value Added is based on the Sustainable Value Added model and combines weighted environmental, <b>social,</b> and corporate <b>governance</b> indicators with their benchmarks determined by Data Envelopment Analysis. Benchmark values of indicators were set for each company separately and determine the optimal combination of environmental, <b>social,</b> and corporate <b>governance</b> inputs to economic outcomes. The Sustainable Environmental, <b>Social</b> and Corporate <b>Governance</b> Value Added methodology is applied on real-life corporate data and presented through a case study. The value added of most of the selected companies was negative, even though economic indicators of all of them are positive. The Sustainable Environmental, <b>Social</b> and Corporate <b>Governance</b> Value Added is intended to help owners, investors, and other stakeholders in their decision-making and sustainability assessment. The use of environmental, <b>social,</b> and corporate <b>governance</b> factors helps identify the company’s strengths and weaknesses, and provides a more sophisticated insight into it than the one-dimensional methods based on economic performance alone...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to set out}} {{the current}} {{theoretical}} landscape of <b>social</b> enterprise <b>governance.</b> It considers the two theories of governance currently advocated in the social enterprise literature [...] -stakeholder and stewardship theories. Furthermore, it asserts the utility of neoinstitutional theory in analysis of <b>social</b> enterprise <b>governance.</b> The methodology employed was critical review and application of the prevailing governance theory in a social enterprise context. The prevailing institutional theory offers {{a great deal in}} explaining the governance dynamic in these organisations. The influence that values, symbols and cultural norms have upon organisation structure are not fully encompassed in <b>social</b> enterprise <b>governance</b> theory. Rather, it has been adapted and diluted to fit different explanations of governance, such as stakeholder and stewardship theory. Institutional theory offers an alternative lens with which to analyse <b>social</b> enterprise <b>governance.</b> This paper advocates institutional analysis of governance as an alternative method of mapping <b>social</b> enterprise <b>governance,</b> testing existing concepts such as isomorphism within the third sector, and new conceptual research. The paper consolidates the governance theory currently attributed to <b>social</b> enterprise <b>governance,</b> and puts forward an alternative theory that considers the influence of institutional pressures upon governance arrangements. It adds to the governance literature by suggesting a deeper analysis of institutional factors upon governance structure. It also adds to the growing literature that focuses on the <b>governance</b> of <b>social</b> enterprise as a distinct form of organisation in the third sector...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} three factors of {{critical}} importance for regional economic development, namely entrepreneurship, <b>social</b> capital and <b>governance.</b> We conclude firstly that the relationships between regional entrepreneurship, regional <b>social</b> capital, regional <b>governance</b> and regional economic development are complex and interdependent. Secondly, to influence these factors {{and the relationship between}} them policy-makers must have a long-term perspective and be both patient and persistent in their efforts. It is our hope that this paper provides both a somewhat better understanding of the relationships between regional entrepreneurship, regional <b>social</b> capital, regional <b>governance</b> and regional economic development and some help to national and regional policy-makers in formulating and implementing the proper long-term regional policies needed.
