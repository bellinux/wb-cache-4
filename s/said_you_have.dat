5|$|Theophrastus {{reports that}} cabbage, radish and turnip are sown in July after the summer solstice, along with beet, lettuce, mustard and coriander. Leeks, celery, onion and orache are sown in January. Cucumber, gourds, basil, {{purslane}} and savory, in contrast, he writes, are sown in April. Ripe seeds do not germinate at once but {{wait for the}} right time. He asserts that all the herbs can be grown from seed, while rue, marjoram and basil can be raised from cuttings, and garlic, onion and other bulbs are grown from their roots. All the flowers of a herb appear at one time, except for basil which puts {{out a series of}} flowers starting low on the plant. Cumin has the most fruits, but it is <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to curse and insult the plant to get a good crop. Theophrastus describes varieties of some herbs, for instance that the white lettuce is sweetest and tenderest, while there are many kinds of onion, with Sardian, Cnidian, Samothracian and Ascalonian varieties from those regions. Garlic is said to be planted close to the solstice; the Cyprian variety is largest and is used in salads. All herbs except rue are said to like dung. Of the wild herbs, Theophrastus reports that some such as cat's ear are edible, whereas others like dandelion are too bitter to be worth eating.|$|E
500|$|Lead singer Bart Millard has {{described}} the story behind [...] "So Long Self" [...] as [...] "...really simple: It’s Not About [...] It never has been and it never will be. Just like when maybe you had to break up with a girlfriend or a boyfriend growing up, or maybe {{the same thing happened}} to you, the ultimate breakup in life is when we breakup with ourselves. Because Christ <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to die to self to follow him". The song is also lyrically about a break-up with sinful human nature.|$|E
500|$|The team {{failed to}} throw a {{touchdown}} pass in any of their first five games, three of which were shutout losses. Offensive coordinator John Rauch walked out on the team during the week 5 game against Cincinnati, and gave 'personal differences' {{as the reason for}} his resignation. His duties were taken over by McKay, who pointed to the increased effectiveness of the team’s “simpler” offense, saying that they were no longer “trying to do all the things people <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to do in this league”. On a strange NFL weekend in which O.J. Simpson was ejected from a game for fighting, the Chicago Bears lost a game due to a referee’s inadvertent whistle, and Minnesota Vikings receiver Sammy White fumbled away a touchdown due to starting his celebration before entering the end zone, McKay launched an obscenity-filled tirade against Denver Broncos coach John Ralston after a blowout loss. McKay admitted that his feelings dated back to their college rivalry, when McKay coached at USC and Ralston coached at Stanford University, but pointed to specific plays such as a reverse and a last-minute punt return as evidence that Ralston was trying to run up the score. Third-string running back Manfred Moore caught a lucky break when, waived after the week 13 game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, he was picked up by the Oakland Raiders as an injury replacement for ex-Buccaneer Rick Jennings. He wound up going from an 0–13 team to the eventual Super Bowl champion. Players began to meet for postgame parties at Steve Spurrier’s house, in order to avoid having to show their faces in public. According to defensive end Pat Toomay, “By the time we got to the last game of the season, we had so many injuries that we didn’t feel we had much of a chance. Everybody was so sick of the season that they showed up packed and ready to get out of town. It looked like a bunch of Okies fleeing the dust bowl." [...] McKay said that the week 4 game against the Baltimore Colts summed up the season: “On one play I looked up and one of our guys was getting kicked out of the game, and two more were getting carried off”.|$|E

2500|$|In effect, {{the suburbs}} would receive an {{additional}} seat to reflect their rapid population growth. Democratic state chairman, Otis B. Morse met with {{political leaders and}} congressmen of his party, including Green. [...] "I'm not married to any plan", commented Green, who seemed {{to back away from}} his earlier scheme. [...] "I've never <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to drop a seat anyplace. I've never <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to add a seat here or there. That's been George Bloom." ...|$|E
2500|$|Romney reluctantly {{backed the}} {{compromise}} amendment, viewing {{it as the}} only feasible way to ban gay marriage in Massachusetts. [...] "If the question is, 'Do you support gay marriage or civil unions?' I'd say neither," [...] Romney said of the amendment. [...] "If they <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to have one or the other, that Massachusetts {{is going to have}} one or the other, then I'd rather have civil unions than gay marriage. But I'd rather have neither." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Well, I was the {{guy that}} {{more often than not}} would be the one that would go into the lions den when they were having disagreements. I'd sort of be the referee, try to resolve it so that we could get back to work. So there was that side of it. Everybody knows there was {{friction}} {{between the two of them}} on the stage. In the beginning, Bruce was just a guy’s guy. Let's just say he evolved. Over the years, he went from being the crew's best friend and just being grateful for the work and all of that to realizing that he was going to be a movie star and wanting to move on. Part of that was because of his strained relationship with Cybill. That sometimes made the set a very unpleasant place to be. Cybill – I got along with her very well at times, other times I’d have to be the one who <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to come out of the trailer and go to work. In fairness to her, she was in the makeup chair at six thirty in the morning with pages of dialogue she hadn’t seen before, she'd work very long hours, and then be back in the makeup chair at six thirty the next morning." ...|$|E

6000|$|Again {{there was}} a spell of silence. At last--"I have been thinking, Monsieur," [...] she said, [...] "of that other {{occasion}} on which you rode with me. I remember that <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> killed a man, and when I asked <b>you</b> why, <b>you</b> <b>said</b> that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> done it because he sought to kill you. Was that the truth?" ...|$|R
2500|$|On {{his coming}} to Town for the Winter, as he {{generally}} does, {{he went to}} the Levee with the Duke of Portland, who went with Lord William to kiss hands on his going into the Guards—while Lord William was kissing hands, The King was talking to The Duke, but his Eyes were fixed on [...] who was standing in the Crowd, and when He said His say to The Duke, without waiting for 's coming up in his turn, The King went up to him, and, after the usual questions of {{how long have you been}} in Town and the weather, He <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been very much employed of late, and very much confined. [...] said, no, Sir, not more than usual—You have and very well employed too, but there are none so deaf as those that w'ont hear, and none so blind as those that w'ont see— made a low bow, Sir, I certainly now understand you, but was afraid my vanity or presumption might have led me to imagine what Your Majesty has said referred to what I have done—You cannot be vain—You have been of use to us all, it is a general opinion, is it not so Lord Stair? who was standing near. It is said Lord Stair;—Your Majesty's adopting it, Sir, will make the opinion general, said —I know it is the general opinion, and I know that there is no Man who calls himself a Gentleman that must not think himself obliged to you, for you have supported the cause of the Gentlemen—You know the tone at Court is a whisper, but The King said all this loud, so as to be heard by every one at Court.|$|E
