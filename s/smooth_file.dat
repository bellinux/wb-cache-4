50|$|The bowl is filed to shape, often using a metal template. The bowl is then formed using a tin {{cake and}} spoon stake. The molten tin is poured around the spoon stake {{and left to}} harden. The handle is then bent down to 45 degrees, and the spoon is {{hammered}} into the tin using the spoon stake and a heavy hammer, to form the bowl. The bend in the handle is then adjusted to match the other spoons in the set and so it sits correctly on the table. The bowl is then filed level, a process called striking off. The surfaces are filed, first with a rough file to remove the fire stain from the surface, then with a <b>smooth</b> <b>file.</b> It is then buffed to remove any file marks and fire stain from inside the bowl and is polished to the desired finish.|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{detail in}} this paper the {{numerical}} implementation of the so-called image curvature microscope, an algorithm that computes accurate image curvatures at subpixel resolution, and yields a curvature map conforming with our visual perception. In contrast to standard methods, which would compute the curvature by a finite difference scheme, the curvatures are evaluated directly on the level lines of the bilinearly interpolated image, after their independent smoothing, a step necessary to remove pixelization artifacts. The smoothing step consists in the affine erosion of the level lines through a geometric scheme, and can be applied in parallel to all level lines. The online algorithm allows the user to visualize the image of curvatures at different resolutions, {{as well as the}} set of level lines before and after smoothing. Source Code The ANSI C++ implementation reviewed by IPOL is given in the file curv. cpp. The complete source code, code documentation, and online demo are accessible at the IPOL web page of this article 1. The level lines extraction (files levelLine. cpp, lltree. cpp) and level lines <b>smoothing</b> (<b>file</b> gass. cpp) are independent algorithms, out of the scope of this article, and details for their implementation are planned for separate IPOL publications...|$|R
50|$|ScanIP {{is capable}} of {{generating}} robust STL files for 3D printing. Files created using ScanIP feature guaranteed watertight triangulations and correct norms, as well as options for volume and topology preserving <b>smoothing.</b> STL <b>files</b> are generated with conforming interfaces, enabling multi-material printing. Internal structures, otherwise known as lattices, can also be added to 3D models of parts {{in order to reduce}} weight prior to additive manufacturing. Example applications include the development of patient-specific implants, lattice support structure generation, and 3D organ printing. ScanIP was used to generate STL files of a man's kidney to aid in a procedure at Southampton General Hospital. Lattice techniques have also been used for developing new parts in aerospace, automotive and other industries.|$|R

40|$|Energy spectra {{both of the}} {{conduction}} and {{valence bands}} of the HgTe quantum wells with a width close to the Dirac point were studied experimentally. Simultaneous analysis of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and Hall effect {{over a wide range}} of electron and hole densities gives surprising result: the top of the valence band is strongly split by spin-orbit interaction while the splitting of the conduction band is absent, within experimental accuracy. Astonishingly, but such a ratio of the splitting values is observed as for structures with normal spectrum so for structures with inverted one. These results do not consistent with the results of kP calculations, in which the <b>smooth</b> electric <b>filed</b> across the quantum well is only reckoned in.

40|$|Unsharp masking is a {{well-known}} image sharpening technique. Given an image and its smoothed version, amplifying high frequencies of the image via unsharp masking is achieved by linear extrapolation of the input images. In this paper, we adapt the unsharp masking technique for 3 D shape deblurring purposes. Consider a blurred shape represented by a triangle mesh. Usually such a shape results from a 3 D data corrupted by noise and then oversmoothed. First we apply unsharp masking to the mesh normals. To <b>smooth</b> the <b>filed</b> of mesh normals we use several local averaging iterations applied to the mesh normals (iterative mean filtering). Then we apply linear extrapolation of the original and smoothed fields of normals. Finally we reconstruct the deblurred mesh by integrating the field of extrapolated normals. We also give a quantitative evaluation of the proposed unsharp masking technique. To perform the evaluation, we use $L^ 2 $ error metrics on mesh vertices and normals. Experimental {{results show that the}} unsharp masking technique is effective for shape deblurring...|$|R
40|$|Simulated {{range and}} range rate data for five {{tracking}} stations were first generated using batch least squares orbit determination (GTDS). Then GTDS was used (in the differential correction mode) {{to produce a}} nominal trajectory which was input to PREFER. The GTDS differential correction (DC) run was made using models which differed from those used to produce the simulated data. These model differences were chosen to be fairly realistic approximations to the errors in the models actually used for operational orbit determination. Several different simulation runs were made with different types of model errors {{in order to determine}} the sensitivity to these errors. The nominal trajectory and the simulated measurement data were input to PREFER to produce a <b>smoothed</b> ephemeris <b>file.</b> Numerous runs of PREFER were made in which parameters describing the statistics of the model errors were varied. The likelihood function computed by the Kalman filter determined the ""best'' choice of input parameters.

25|$|Ancient Chinese coins are {{markedly}} different from coins {{produced in the}} west. Chinese coins were manufactured by being cast in molds, whereas western coins were typically cut and hammered or, in later times, milled. Chinese coins were usually made from mixtures of metals such copper, tin and lead, from bronze, brass or iron: precious metals like gold and silver were uncommonly used. The ratios and purity of the coin metals varied considerably. Most Chinese coins were produced with a square hole in the middle. This was used to allow collections of coins to be threaded on a square rod so that the rough edges could be <b>filed</b> <b>smooth,</b> and then threaded on strings for ease of handling.|$|R
50|$|The cut of {{the file}} refers to how fine its teeth are. They are defined as (from roughest to smoothest): rough, middle, bastard, second cut, smooth, and dead <b>smooth.</b> A {{single-cut}} <b>file</b> has one set of parallel teeth while a cross-cut or double-cut file has {{a second set of}} cuts forming diamond shaped cutting surfaces. In Swiss-pattern files the teeth are cut at a shallower angle, and are graded by number, with a number 1 file being coarser than a number 2, etc. Most files have teeth on all faces, but some specialty flat files have teeth on only one face or one edge, so that the user can come right up to another edge without damaging the finish on it.|$|R

For anhidrosis: Monitoring body temperature helps to institute timely measures to prevent/manage hyperthermia or hypothermia. For insensitivity to pain: Modify {{as much as}} reasonable a child’s activities to prevent injuries. Inability to provide proper immobilization {{as a treatment for}} orthopedic injuries often delays healing; additionally, bracing and invasive orthopedic procedures increase the risk for infection. Methods used to prevent injuries to the lips, buccal mucosa, tongue, and teeth include tooth extraction, and/or <b>filing</b> (<b>smoothing)</b> of the sharp incisal edges of teeth, and/or use of a mouth guard. Skin care with moisturizers can help prevent palmar and plantar hyperkeratosis and cracking and secondary risk of infection; neurotrophic keratitis is best treated with routine care for dry eyes, prevention of corneal infection, and daily observation of the ocular surface. Interventions for behavioral, developmental, and motor delays as well as educational and social support for school-age children and adolescents are recommended.|$|R

25|$|The {{manufacture}} of the chains involved several processes: The {{figure of eight}} links were punched from a sheet of steel and assembled three deep with the centre link overlapping the two outer, like a bicycle chain. The links were held together with rivets cut from steel wire and hooks punched from sheet metal were attached to either end. The entire chain was <b>filed</b> <b>smooth,</b> burnished and tempered in hot oil. Because the work was so fine, the chains were often thinner than a piece of cotton thread, a magnifying instrument was required. In addition it was common practice to place a glass globe filled with water {{in front of a}} candle and a mirror behind to increase the light. By 1793 Robert Cox had a monopoly on chain production in Britain, supplying watch, clock and chronometer makers throughout the country. Production flourished and in 1845 William Hart opened a similar factory in Bargates. It was built to an advanced design with particularly large windows on either side. 74' long but only 18' wide, it allowed the maximum amount of natural light to enter.|$|R

This contribution describes the algorithm and a first validation of the global LAI, FAPAR and FCOVER products derived from AVHRR Long Term Data Record (LTDR) for the 1981 - 2000 period within geoland 2 project. GEOV 1 _AVHRR algorithm aims to ensure robustness and consistency of the derived biophysical products with the ones developed in the recent years, and particularly with the GEOV 1 _VGT products derived from SPOT/VGT sensor. The approach {{is based on the}} use of neural networks and dedicated temporal <b>smoothing</b> and gap <b>filing</b> techniques. The comparison of GEOV 1 _AVHRR with GEOV 1 _VGT and with similar products derived from AVHRR GIMMS shows that GEOV 1 _AVHRR outperforms the current existing products in terms of smoothness and continuity (fraction of valid data of 99. 7 %). At the same time, GEOV 1 _AVHRR shows high consistency with GEOV 1 _VGT and a similar accuracy (RMSE= 0. 80) as evaluated with ground-based observations. Combination of GEOV 1 _AVHRR and GEOV 1 _VGT realizes thus the objective of producing continuous and consistent time series of global observations of LAI, FAPAR and FCOVER for the last three decades. In the next months GEOV 1 _AVHRR products will be freely accessible at geoland 2 portal at 0. 05 º spatial resolution and 10 days temporal sampling frequency...|$|R
40|$|Predicted {{values of}} {{atmospheric}} angular momentum (AAM) from the U. S. National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) were {{introduced into the}} International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) Bulletin A (rapid service/prediction of Earth orientation) combination during 2000 {{in an effort to}} improve the near-term universal time–coordinated universal time (UT 1 –UTC) predictions. In this approach, only the atmospheric contributions to the excitation of UT 1 variations were included and contributions from other sources, such as the oceans, were neglected. However, we observed that using this approach the AAM inputs sometimes degraded the UT 1 predictions as much as they helped and suspended their use in early 2001 for re-evaluation. This re-evaluation resulted in a greater appreciation of the systematic differences between the AAM and UT 1 R series as well as suggests that, in the actual Earth system, the oceans balance some of the atmospheric variability on specific time scales between 2 and 15 days. Since near-real time oceanic angular momentum information is currently not available, an improved approach for assimilating AAM data products was developed.

40|$|Vertex- and face-based {{subdivision}} schemes are now routinely used in {{geometric modeling}} and computational science, and their primal/dual relationships are well studied. In this thesis we interpret these schemes as defining bases for discrete differential 0 - resp. 2 -forms, and present a novel subdivision-based method of constructing smooth differential forms on simplicial surfaces. It completes {{the picture of}} classic primal/dual subdivision by introducing a new concept named r-cochain subdivision. Such subdivision schemes map scalar coefficients on r-simplexes from the coarse to the refined mesh and converge to r-forms on the mesh. We perform convergence and smoothness analysis in an arbitrary topology setting by utilizing the techniques of matrix subdivision and the subdivision differential structure. The other significance of our method is its preserving exactness of differential forms. We prove that exactness preserving {{is equivalent to the}} commutative relations between the subdivision schemes and the topological exterior derivative. Our construction is based on treating r- and (r+ 1) -cochain subdivision schemes as a pair and enforcing the commutative relations. As a result, our low-order construction recovers classic Whitney forms, while the high-order construction yields a new class of high order Whitney forms. The 1 -form bases are C^ 1, except at irregular vertices where they are C^ 0. We also demonstrate extensions to three-dimensional subdivision schemes and non-simplicial meshes as well, such as quadrilaterals and octahedra. Our construction is seamlessly integrated with surface subdivision. Once a metric is supplied, the scalar 1 -form coefficients define a <b>smooth</b> tangent vector <b>filed</b> on the underlying subdivision surface. Design of tangent vector fields is made particularly easy with this machinery as we demonstrate. The subdivision r-forms can also be used as finite element bases for physical simulations on curved surfaces. We demonstrate the optimal rate of convergence in solving the Laplace and bi-Laplace equations of 1 -forms...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 43 - 47) It {{is believed}} that cardiovascular hyper reactivity to real-life stressors {{can lead to the}} development of cardiovascular disease due to the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) dominance over the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) (de Jonge, Moreira, Martin & Ravussin, 2010), however this mechanism isn???t completely understood. This hyper reactivity to real-life stressors puts a strain on the ANS, which can theoretically cause an energy imbalance. Real life stressors can be physical or psychological, however research has also shown that chronic physical stress such as exercise causes an increase in vagal tone and a decreased cardiac response (Spalding, Jeffers, Porges & Hatfield, 1999). 	To further study physiological responses and ANS modulation in response to physical and psychological stressors, it is vital that research procedures are standardized in order to directly compare the data between different studies. One method of ensuring research standardization is to create an instruction manual with lab testing procedures. In addition to providing standardization the research manual will also serve as a teaching tool for students {{to learn more about the}} ANS and further advance the knowledge in the field of ANS modulation. This research manual is designed to provide step-by-step instructions for common research protocols used in a psychophysiology laboratory. The manual includes protocols for the following procedures: conducting research on the stress response in the presence of physical and psychological stressors, obtaining anthropometric measurements, setting up the SenseWear Armband, electrode placement for the LifeShirt system and the Impedance Cardiograph, resting a subject before and after testing, administering the three part Stroop test, uploading LifeShirt data, uploading SenseWear Armband data, appropriate documentation protocol, <b>smoothing</b> Vivometrics data <b>files,</b> and conducting on-site testing on performing artists in the rehearsal hall and theatre. To ensure reliability these protocols were identified for the research manual because they have been successfully administered in the psychophysiology lab for previous psychophysiology studies. While this research manual is comprehensive, it does not include all of the psychophysiology research protocols that are currently being used in present studies. In the effort to provide standardization in the field additional research manuals need to be developed to ensure the same protocols are being used across studies. Furthermore, there are inconsistencies in the research regarding data analysis (Ritz, 2009), which suggests that the field will strongly benefit from a research manual to include various methods of analyzing psychophysiology data...|$|R
