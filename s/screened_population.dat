50|$|Automated {{techniques}} {{have also been}} developed to allow for more efficient and less expensive imaging. Heidelberg retinal tomography (HRT), scanning laser polarimetry and optical coherence tomography are computerised techniques for imaging various structures of the eyes, including the optic disc. They quantify the nerve fiber layer of disc and surrounding retina and statistically correlate the findings with a database of previously <b>screened</b> <b>population</b> of normals. They are useful for baseline and serial follow-up to monitor minute changes in optic disc morphology. Imaging will not provide conclusive evidence for clinical diagnosis however, and the evidence needs to be supplanted by serial physiological testing for functional changes. Such tests may include visual field charting and final clinical interpretation of the complete eye examination by an eye care physician. Ophthalmologists and optometrists are able to provide this service.|$|E

40|$|Background: Screening for {{cardiovascular}} disease {{is an important}} primary preventive measure, yet research has documented that not all population groups receive the same quality of preventive healthcare. Design: Longitudinal analysis of {{cardiovascular disease}} risk factor recording. Methods: Data were made available from a local population-based screening programme for cardiovascular disease (1989 - 1999), whereby residents aged 35 - 60 years were invited for screening every 5 years (n= 84 646). Data were recorded for major risk factors including blood pressure, cholesterol, body mass index, smoking status, and alcohol consumption. Completeness of risk factor recording was compared between groups in the <b>screened</b> <b>population</b> defined by gender, ethnicity (Caucasian/South Asian) and employment status (employed/unemployed). Results: Recording of risk in the <b>screened</b> <b>population</b> was significantly less complete for women and South Asian participants over {{the duration of the}} screening programme, compared with men and Caucasian participants respectively. Conversely, recording of risk was significantly more complete for the unemployed compared with the employed participants. Conclusions: These findings present evidence of a less systematic screening procedure for women and South Asians, whilst it seems that men, Caucasian participants and the unemployed were appropriately screened. Inequalities at the primary preventive level will likely influence outcome, because equitable identification of risk is important for the provision of successful treatment measures, and to reduce inequalities in morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular disease...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCION : PSA is {{the most}} {{important}} tumor marker in all solid tumor, indispensable in the management of prostate cancer. Screening for prostate cancer is still not recommended, although performed in many countries, which introduced questions about the usefulness of PSA in detection of prostate cancer. The PSA threshold has also been changed, the value of PSA derivatives revised. Whether such changes are applicable in non <b>screened</b> <b>population</b> is questionable. Aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the predictive value of PSA, free/ total PSA and PSA density in our non <b>screened</b> <b>population.</b> Patients and methods: TRUS guided prostate biopsy was performed in 579 patients. The number of cores was 6 - 12. Mean age of the patients was 67. 5 years (30 - 90). PSA was ranging from 0. 41 to 2250 (mean 38. 6 ng/ml, median: 11. 95, SD 140, 45). Digitorectal examination was considered positive in 351 patients. Free PSA was measured in 352 patients with the index ranging from 0. 02 to 0. 88 (mean free/total PSA: 0. 14, median: 0. 13,). The volume of the prostate was measured in all patients according the prostate ellipsoid model, and PSA density calculated according to the formula PSA/PV. Patients were stratified in 6 groups according to PSA value (I: PSA ng/ml, II: PSA 2. 5 - 4, III: PSA 4 - 10, IV: PSA 10 - 20, V: PSA: 20 to 50, Group 6 : PSA 50). RESULTS: Non homogenicity of the patients can be seen through the wide range of PSA which was from 0. 4 to 2025). Prostate cancer was diagnosed in 233 pts (40. 2 %). As expected, the probability of detecting cancer was raised with PSA (p), and was extremely rare in pts with PSA below 4 ng/ml. PSA, free/total PSA, volume of the prostate and PSA density were significantly different according to the presence of cancer. Most of our patients had PSA between 4 and 20 ng/ml. Predictive value of PSA was 20. 6 % for pts with PSA from 4 to 10 and 32. 7 % for those with PSA from 10 to 20 ng/ml. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for different cut off’s of PSA (4, 10 and 20) was performed. The best results were obtained for PSA cut off of 10 ng/ml. In the group of patient with PSA, PSA density more reliable than free/total PSA index. CONCLUSION: PSA is still valuable marker for detection of prostate cancer in our non <b>screened</b> <b>population.</b> According to our results PSA threshold should not be lowered below 4 ng/ml. PSA density is a reliable PSA derivative, free/total PSA index having less importance in pts with PSA below 20 ng/ml...|$|E

Immunochemical fecal occult blood tests (I-FOBT) are claimed to perform better, without randomized comparison in <b>screening</b> <b>populations.</b> Our aim was to randomly compare G-FOBT with I-FOBT in a <b>screening</b> <b>population.</b> METHODS: We conducted a population-based study on {{a random sample of}} 20, 623 individuals 50 - 75 years of age, randomized to either G-FOBT (Hemoccult-II) or I-FOBT (OC-Sensor). Tests and invitations were sent together. For I-FOBT, the standard cutoff of 100 ng/ml was used. Positive FOBTs were verified with colonoscopy. Advanced adenomas were defined as >or= 10 mm, high-grade dysplasia, or >or= 20 % villous component. RESULTS: There were 10, 993 tests returned: 4836 (46. 9 %) G-FOBTs and 6157 (59. 6 %) I-FOBTs. The participation rate difference was 12. 7 % (P <. 01). Of G-FOBTs, 117 (2. 4 %) were positive versus 339 (5. 5 %) of I-FOBTs. The positivity rate difference was 3. 1 % (P <. 01). Cancer and advanced adenomas were found, respectively, in 11 and 48 of G-FOBTs and in 24 and 121 of I-FOBTs. Differences in positive predictive value for cancer and advanced adenomas and cancer were, respectively, 2. 1 % (P =. 4) and - 3. 6 % (P =. 5). Differences in specificities favor G-FOBT and were, respectively, 2. 3 % (P <. 01) and - 1. 3 % (P <. 01). Differences in intention-to-screen detection rates favor I-FOBT and were, respectively, 0. 1 % (P <. 05) and 0. 9 % (P <. 01).
