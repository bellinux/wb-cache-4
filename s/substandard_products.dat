The [...] "Krusty Korporation", the company responsible for Krusty's licensing, has also launched a series of disastrous promotions and business ventures, such as sponsoring the 1984 Summer Olympics with a rigged promotion that backfired when the Soviet Union boycotted the games, causing Krusty to lose $44 million. In the TV series and comic books Krusty is also the mascot and owner of the restaurant Krusty Burger. He has been shut down by the health board many times for everything from overworking employees to stapling together half-eaten burgers to make new ones, as well as using beef infected with Mad Cow Disease to save money. Krusty wastes money almost as fast as he earns it: lighting his cigarettes with hundred-dollar bills, eating condor-egg omelettes, spending huge sums on pornographic magazines and call girls, and losing a fortune gambling on everything from horse races to operas and betting against the Harlem Globetrotters.|$|E

The explosive growth the WWW has made it the largest single service on the Internet. With this growth comes a need for guidance to organizations or individuals desiring to establish new Web sites. This thesis provides the guidance needed to define a potential site's requirements and select the infrastructure necessary to fulfill those requirements. A combination of literature review of current books and periodicals, as well as surveys of WWW sites was used to obtain information. This information was used to develop the framework for defining requirements. A rule based heuristic was also adopted from the literature and subsequently validated. It is used to select the computing hardware needed for a site. A key lesson learned is that most organizations do not conduct any initial requirements analysis to determine a site's infrastructure needs. The reasons range from oversight to indifference.

The objective {{of this study was}} study the preference of registered medical practitioners towards prescribing of drugs by generic name or brand name and to know the reasons for the same. Methods: The questionnaire based observational study was done on 300 registered medical practitioners after satisfying inclusion and exclusion criteria. The data collected was evaluated and the response recorded in percentage. Results: Out of 300 practitioners 92 % admitted prescribing drug by brand name for fear of substitution by <b>substandard</b> <b>product</b> and did not allow pharmacist to substitute the same, rest 8 % prescribe by generic names. 78 % considered generic drugs to be less efficacious and 3 % had the view that they have more side effects. 83 % doctors consider patient affordability while prescribing however only 60 % of them informed patients about the cost of prescribed drugs. Other factors influencing prescription behaviour were health care administration policy (10 %) and company representative (7 %). Conclusions: Majority of physicians prescribe drugs by brand names due to its assured efficacy and they are reluctant to prescribe generic names because of their view of substitution by less efficacious, <b>substandard</b> and counterfeit <b>products.</b> The regulating agencies have to assure the efficacy of generic products. The spurious and substandard drugs available in the market have to be checked and strict action should be taken {{in order to maintain the}} quality of these products.

This is generated during the production and distribution through decomposition of food, vegetables, or meat, removal of non-usable parts, removal of <b>substandard</b> <b>products,</b> and spoiling due to substandard packaging. Thus agricultural waste is generated at all stages of food system including farming, storage, processing, and wholesaling. The food scraps generated by retailers and consumers {{are not included in}} this category as these scraps enter the waste stream as municipal solid waste that is described in the previous section. Animal wastes are wastes generated from farms and feedlots, also known as Animal Feeding Operations (AFOs) or Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs), consisting of leftover feeds, manure and urine, wastewater, dead animals, and production operation wastes. They produce large amounts of waste in small areas. For example, EPA reports that a single dairy cow produces approximately 120 pounds of wet manure per day equaling to that of 20-40 people. The main problems of animal waste mismanagement are environmental, especially water pollution.|$|E

40|$|Dermal fillers, or just fillers, are {{products}} that are injected into or under the skin for medical or cosmetic purposes. This could be to restore the natural contours of the body after an operation for example, but also to mask the visible effects of ageing. The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) has compiled an overview of 26 so-called non-permanent fillers that were marketed in the Netherlands in 2014, and has analysed these products in a laboratory. The technical files of the 14 manufacturers of these products were also investigated. Following a request through professional associations, 67 treating professionals completed a questionnaire about the fillers that they use and about their potential side effects. All 26 products from 14 manufacturers proved to be harmless. In order to establish this, an internationally recognised laboratory test that measures harmful effects on cells was carried out. The composition of the products conforms with the description in the technical files. According to the treating professionals, the products from the 14 manufacturers cause very few side effects. The quality of key sections in the technical files of the 14 manufacturers varied. It is important that manufacturers ensure their technical files are kept in good order.

40|$|Homeopathy is {{a system}} of {{medicine}} based on {{the application of the}} principle of therapeutic similitude (similia similibus curentur) which stimulates the reaction of the organism by using medicines that cause similar effects with the underlying symptoms of disease. The second main principle is the usage of minimal doses to enhance the own natural immunity of human body. According to the recent surveys, the population in some countries (for instance India, Brazil, France, Russia, Germany, and etc.) shows high confidence in homeopathic treatment methods. Similarly as the manufacturers of conventional pharmaceuticals, the requirements to adhere to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) principles imply for manufacturers of homeopathic medicines. Indeed, most of the recognized manufacturers have already established relevant measures according to the GMP. Hence, the specific issues in the manufacturing and quality control of homeopathic medicines would be discussed. It has to be emphasized that failure to apply GMP could lead to <b>substandard</b> <b>product</b> quality or even major quality concerns such as misidentification, presence of impurity in starting material, contamination. Ultimately it may cause a serious risk to public health while the product recall from the market would be inevitable. However, the manufacturing in homeopathy poses some unique challenges which demands specifically competent personnel. Source materials (as mother tinctures), excipients, or final homeopathic product must comply with quality standards published in official pharmacopoeias or other officially recognized documents. The critical issue is handling toxic materials, materials, particularly fresh ones, that are prone to degradation processes and microbial contamination; and homeopathic medicines derived from animals or human sources. Some of these raw materials constitute potential safety hazards, even at highest dilutions. The properties of medicines can be also compromised by accidental contamination of starting materials, excipients, or by contamination of vessels in which the dilutions are made. Consistency of homeopathic product quality is assured not only by defining appropriate specifications but also by implementing standard manufacturing procedures validated according to GMP...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} role of {{producer}} services and ICT on international outsourcing. The motivation for outsourcing {{is to focus on}} core business and improve efficiency and outsourcing companies usually outsource a number of functions and the efficiency gains depend on the ability for the suppliers to deliver the required quality at the right time. If only one is late or delivers a <b>substandard</b> <b>product,</b> it will delay the entire process or reduce the quality of the final product. The timeliness of delivery and the fulfilment of quality standards depend critically on the availability of producer services. Transport, communication and other logistics services are obvious in this respect, but also services such as testing and technical services contribute to enable suppliers in low-cost countries to enter the outsourcing market. I therefore argue that international outsourcing can best be understood within an analysis framework of many suppliers that are interdependent, and the O-ring theory of production is such a theory. The paper first presents and modifies this model and then explores its predictions in an empirical analysis of the determinants of international vertical specialization as defined by an index developed by Hummels et al. (2001). The index is calculated for a cross-section of 52 countries and 5 sectors and regressed on a number of variables affecting the timeliness of delivery. It is found that vertical specialization is sensitive to trade barriers and infrastructure quality and cost of infrastructural services. The relative importance of trade barriers and various indicators of infrastructure vary between sectors. Vertical specialization in the electronics sector appears to be most sensitive to trade barriers and the density of the telecommunication network. This is also the case for the motor vehicles sector, but the size of the parameters is somewhat lower. The chemicals sector is most sensitive to the restriction on maritime services, while for textiles and clothing the aggregated measure of infrastructure had the highest explanatory power. Only in the electronics sector did the wage level (GDP per capita was used as a proxy) matter for vertical specialization...|$|R
