40|$|Sucrose esters (SEs) are {{biodegradable}} surfactants {{that can}} be manufactured in various hydrophilic-lipophilic balances (HLB) {{through the use of}} different fatty acids. They are used in food and in industries, such as the cosmetics, detergents and pharmaceutical industries. In aqueous media they can form gels, which can affectvarious industrial processes. The pharmaceutical industry is currently showing an increasing preference for biomaterials and environmentally sensitive gels, and in particular thermo-sensitive gels. By virtue of the nontoxic, biodegradable and gel-forming properties of SEs, they are promising materials with which to formthermo-sensitive delivery systems. In this study, the gelling properties of some sucrose <b>stearates</b> were investigated by rheological measurements, and compared with each other. The effects of the release of gel-forming SEs on a model drug (paracetamol) were evaluated through in vitro drug release studies. The rheological results indicated that the sucrose <b>stearates</b> with lower HLB values have higher gel strengths than those of the more hydrophilic sucrose <b>stearates.</b> The gelling of the SEs is concentration- and temperature-dependent, and this gelling behaviour is responsible for the great effect of sucrose <b>stearates</b> on drug release...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} Iron, Cobalt and Manganese <b>stearates</b> are {{examined}} on the post-bacterial photochemical and thermal degradation of polyethylene (LDPE). The activity of <b>stearates</b> has been evaluated by ATR-FTIR, chemiluminescence and GPC of polyethylenes. A {{significant increase in}} carbonyl index for PE containing <b>stearates</b> was determined by FTIR together with a marked decrease in molecular weight as measured by GPC. All three metal <b>stearates</b> induced the development of drastic photo- and thermal-degradation processes for polyethylenes containing metal <b>stearates</b> except {{in the case of}} LDPE-Fe film which did not exhibit any significant thermocatalytic effect on degradation. In a second post bacterial study step, a mixture of three Bacillus MIX (B acillus cereus, B acillus megaterium and B acillus subtilis) as well as Brevibacillus borstelensis were tested for biodegradation (90 days at 45 °C) of the highly photo- and thermo-degraded polyethylene films. Biodegraded materials were characterized using different techniques and mineralization was evaluated by carbon dioxide measurement using an indirect impedance technique. The biodegradation of degraded LDPE films by B. borstelensis and the mixture of Bacillus MIX was highly effective following the order LDPE-Co>LDPE-Mn>LDPE-Fe and in the range of 9. 0 - 59. 2 % of mineralization after only 90 days of bacterial bioassay at 45 °C. The approach studied in this work showed much higher degradable efficacy than that already reported in the literature. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. This work was supported by MICINN, Ref.

5|$|The {{stabilizing}} {{effect of}} cadmium chemicals like the carboxylates cadmium laurate and cadmium <b>stearate</b> on PVC {{led to an}} increased use of those compounds in the 1970s and 1980s. The demand for cadmium in pigments, coatings, stabilizers, and alloys declined {{as a result of}} environmental and health regulations in the 1980s and 1990s; in 2006, only 7% of to total cadmium consumption was used for plating, and only 10% was used for pigments.|$|E
5|$|Aroma {{compounds}} {{are responsible}} for the particular odour or taste in some species, e.g. sotolon in the fenugreek-smelling Lactarius helvus, or the similar quabalactone III in Lactarius rubidus which causes a maple syrup-like odour in dried specimens. Pigments have been isolated from brightly coloured species, e.g. (7-isopropenyl-4-methylazulen-1-yl)methyl <b>stearate</b> from the blue Lactarius indigo or russulaflavidin and a derivative from the yellow Russula flavida. Some Russula species contain pigmented pteridine derivatives called russupteridines that are not found in the milk-caps. Sesquiterpenes are characteristic secondary metabolites of many Russulaceae, especially milk-caps which have been quite intensively studied. They are thought to be responsible for the hot taste in many species and may have deterrent, antifeeding functions in nature.|$|E

30|$|The typical {{compounds}} {{indicating a}} drying oil are fatty acids and dicarboxylic acids deriving from the triacylglycerols {{of the oil}} binder [33]. The ratio of palmitic to stearic acid (P/S, based on peak areas in the total ion chromatogram) ranges from 0.87 to 1.9 for the samples tested; while most of these values fall within the range typical for linseed oil (c. 1 – 2), the lower values may be attributable {{to the presence of}} additives such as <b>stearates.</b> Metal <b>stearates</b> have been used in the paint industry to help suspend pigments in oil to prevent separation, {{to reduce the amount of}} oil needed to wet the pigment, and/or to increase the body of the paint by forming a gel with the oil thereby requiring less pigment [18].|$|R

25|$|Being inexpensively {{available}} and chemically benign, stearic acid finds many niche applications, for example, in making plaster castings from a plaster piece mold or waste mold and {{in making the}} mold from a shellacked clay original. In this use, powdered stearic acid is mixed in water and the suspension is brushed onto the surface to be parted after casting. This reacts with the calcium in the plaster to form {{a thin layer of}} calcium <b>stearate,</b> which functions as a release agent. When reacted with zinc it forms zinc <b>stearate,</b> which is used as a lubricant for playing cards (fanning powder) to ensure a smooth motion when fanning.

40|$|The {{photodegradation}} (432 h under irradiation of Xe-Lamp-solar filter) of an ethylene {{vinyl acetate}} (EVA) copolymer with vinyl acetate content of 9 % was studied, {{and the effect of}} iron and calcium <b>stearates</b> was evaluated using different techniques such us attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and thermal analysis methods (DSC and TGA). A re-arrangement in crystallization and consequent decrease in thermal stability were found through differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), which were in agreement with the chain scission tendency. The presence of Ca and Fe pro-oxidants additives in EVA films increased the ketone carbonyl formation and decreased the ester absorption band of the acetate respect to the pure EVA, as it was evidenced by the significant changes in Carbonyl Indexes found by FTIR. The activity of <b>stearates</b> has been also evaluated by chemiluminescence, where the temperature-ramping tests under nitrogen showed the formation of a peroxide peak at lower temperature. The lower stability of the films containing pro-oxidants was evidenced by the values of oxidation induction time (OIT) determined by DSC. The results were supported by GC-MS, where the concentration of extracted products identified in the EVA containing pro-oxidants was significant and a much greater decrease in molecular weight was determined by GPC, which confirmed the development of degradation for EVA with Ca and Fe <b>stearates</b> in comparison to pure EVA. Biodegradation of photodegraded EVA films were studied at 45 °C during 90 days using a mixture of Bacillus (MIX) (B. cereus, B. megaterium, and B. subtilis) and, in parallel, by Brevibacillus borstelensis as reference strain. Biodegradation of EVA-films was studied by Chemiluminescence, ATR-FTIR and GC-product analysis and the data confirm more efficient biodegradation on the materials containing pro-oxidants. The chemiluminescence emissions due to decomposition of oxidation species was observed at lower temperatures on the biodegraded samples. Also, the drastic decrease of carbonyl index and the disappearance of photogenerated low molecular products with biodegradation were more efficient on the biodegraded films containing pro-oxidants. EVA mineralization was evaluated by carbon dioxide measurement using indirect impedance technique. Biodegradation by B. borstelensis and MIX at 45 °C was similar and exhibited a pronounced difference between the pure photodegraded EVA film (around 15 % of mineralization) and the corresponding photodegraded films containing Ca and Fe <b>stearates</b> where biodegradation extent reached values of 23 - 26 % of biodegradation after 90 days.
