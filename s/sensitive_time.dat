25|$|At the post-launch news conference, NASA {{officials}} {{reported that}} three foam events {{were seen in}} the external fuel tank (ET) video camera footage. They further quoted that the events weren't a concern since the foam loss events occurred after the aerodynamic <b>sensitive</b> <b>time</b> period. Later in the day, based on a quick-look review of the launch video, crew communicator (CAPCOM) astronaut Christopher Ferguson also informed the shuttle crew {{that there were no}} ascent debris events of concern.|$|E
25|$|The top cleric in Alexandria, the Patriarchal Vicar Hegumen Ruweis Marcos, {{said that}} the Egyptian {{government}} and security forces wanted to blame the bombing on a suicide bomber instead of a car bomb in order to write off the crime as something carried out by a lone attacker. He also denounced the lack of protection {{in front of the}} church, stating he was surprised to find only three soldiers and one officer guarding the church at such a <b>sensitive</b> <b>time</b> in spite of the recent numerous threats against Copts.|$|E
25|$|Until fairly recently, China's {{political}} environment {{has made it}} difficult to properly gauge the extent of natural disasters. Successive governments have placed more importance on the appearance of harmony rather than accurate information on damage. The Tangshan earthquake came at a rather politically <b>sensitive</b> <b>time</b> during the late stages of the Cultural Revolution, making accurate statistics especially difficult to find. The Tangshan earthquake killed 242,000 people according to official figures, though some sources estimate a death toll up to three times higher. This would make it the deadliest earthquake in modern times, and the second or third deadliest in recorded history. It is worth noting that the population of Tangshan at the time the quake struck was estimated to be around 1.6 million and that most of Tangshan's city proper was flattened.|$|E

25|$|In May 2014, the Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, a {{non-profit}} art center {{situated in the}} 798 art district of Beijing, held a retrospective exhibition {{in honor of the}} late curator and scholar, Hans Van Dijk. Ai, a good friend of Hans and a fellow co-founder of the China Art Archives and Warehouse (CAAW), participated in the exhibition with three artworks. On the day of the opening, Ai realized his name was omitted from both Chinese and English versions of the exhibition's press release. Ai's assistants went to the art center and removed his works. It is Ai's belief that, in omitting his name, the museum altered the historical record of van Dijk's work with him. Ai started his own research about what actually happened, and between 23 and 25 May he interviewed the UCCA's director, Philip Tinari, the guest curator of the exhibition, Marianne Brouwer, and the UCCA chief, Xue Mei. He published the transcripts of the interviews on Instagram. In one of the interviews, the CEO of the UCCA, Xue Mei, admitted that, due to the <b>sensitive</b> <b>time</b> of the exhibition, Ai's name was taken out of the press releases {{on the day of the}} opening and it was supposed to be restored afterwards. This was to avoid problems with the Chinese authorities, who threatened to arrest her.|$|E

2500|$|The {{debate over}} {{what led to}} the events came at a {{politically}} <b>sensitive</b> <b>time</b> in Canada, as the Minister of National Defence Kim Campbell {{was in the midst of}} a Progressive Conservative Party of Canada leadership campaign to become Prime Minister. Matters were made worse when Campbell tried to dismiss the allegations of racism in the Canadian military by referring to it as [...] "youthful folly" [...] and suggesting that it was commonplace. Criticism also focused on the fact that it took five weeks to order a high-level investigation into the events in Somalia.|$|E

50|$|The {{effect that}} {{wildlife}} tourism {{will have on}} wildlife depends {{on the scale of}} tourist development and the behavior and resilience of wildlife to the presence of humans. When tourists activities occur during <b>sensitive</b> <b>times</b> of the life cycle (for example, during nesting season), and when they involve close approaches to wildlife for the purpose of identification or photography, the potential for disturbance is high. Not all species appear to be disturbed by tourists even within heavily visited areas.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Avoiding {{packet loss}} is {{critical}} for <b>time</b> <b>sensitive</b> network applications, such as multimedia streams for video/voice. Delaying and dropping low priority packets to ensure high priority and <b>time</b> <b>sensitive</b> data stream deliver during network congestion is a basic QoS (quality of service) mechanism over current network infrastructure. This mechanism works if <b>time</b> <b>sensitive</b> data stream is the minority of the network traffic and if the network is not very congested. The methodology of dropping low priority data will not scale when <b>time</b> <b>sensitive</b> data stream uses high percentage of network bandwidth. This is because bandwidth required by video/audio applications can vary in very wide range when real-time data becomes majority network traffic, tha...|$|R
60|$|Lucy Ashton, in short, was {{involved}} in those mazes of the imagination which are most dangerous to {{the young and the}} <b>sensitive.</b> <b>Time,</b> it is true, absence, change of scene and new faces, might probably have destroyed the illusion in her instance, as it has done in many others; but her residence remained solitary, and her mind without those means of dissipating her pleasing visions. This solitude was chiefly owing to the absence of Lady Ashton, who was at this time in Edinburgh, watching the progress of some state-intrigue; the Lord Keeper only received society out of policy or ostentation, and was by nature rather reserved and unsociable; and thus no cavalier appeared to rival or to obscure the ideal picture of chivalrous excellence which Lucy had pictured to herself in the Master of Ravenswood.|$|E
