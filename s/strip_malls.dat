5|$|After CR4, NY179 {{proceeds}} east through Orchard Park as a two-lane boulevard, intersecting {{the northern}} terminus of CR461 (California Road). After crossing under another railroad, NY179 returns to four-lanes, passing south of several <b>strip</b> <b>malls</b> in Orchard Park. The route soon becomes a divided highway, entering a cloverleaf interchange with US219 (the Southern Expressway). After the interchange, NY179 parallels as a four-lane boulevard between several <b>strip</b> <b>malls,</b> soon intersecting with US20 (Southwestern Boulevard), where NY179 terminates. CR460 continues eastward along Mile Strip Road to NY187.|$|E
5|$|After re-crossing into Hamburg, NY179 {{continues}} eastward as Mile Strip Road, {{entering a}} large interchange with the New York State Thruway (I-90 exit56), which connects via trumpet interchange. After bending northeast, the route crosses over the Thruway, becoming a two-lane commercial street, passing {{north and south}} of several <b>strip</b> <b>malls</b> until an intersection with County Route204 (CR204; McKinley Parkway). After CR204, NY179 passes north of McKinley Mall, proceeding eastward as a four-lane divided boulevard past several residences before bending northeast, intersecting with CR4 (Abbott Road) in the town of Orchard Park.|$|E
5|$|Past NY281, NY222 crosses a {{commercial}} section of Cortlandville, passing several <b>strip</b> <b>malls</b> prior to entering {{the city of}} Cortland. Now named Groton Avenue, the route slowly curves eastward while traversing a residential part of the city. It passes north of the State University of New York at Cortland, and the campus marks {{the western edge of}} downtown Cortland. NY222 becomes {{a commercial}}ized street again, serving a pair of city blocks before intersecting with US 11 and NY41 (Main Street). US 11 and NY 41 join NY222, and the concurrency between the three routes heads east through downtown as Clinton Avenue. The overlap lasts for just one block, however, as NY222 ends upon intersecting NY13 at the next junction. NY13 northbound continues east along Clinton Avenue while NY13 southbound heads south along Church Street on an overlap with US11 and NY41.|$|E

5|$|The route heads {{through some}} {{residential}} neighborhoods before entering a commercial area with <b>strip</b> <b>malls</b> and some high-rise buildings where White Flint Mall, {{once one of}} the D.C. metropolitan area's largest shopping malls, was located {{on the east side of}} the road. The road comes to an intersection with Old Georgetown Road as well as a grade-separated interchange at Montrose Parkway. The Metro Red Line draws farther east from MD355 before it crosses into Rockville, the county seat of Montgomery County. In Rockville, the road passes more commercial development with a railroad line paralleling the road a short distance to the east. The route intersects MD 911 (First Street) and the Wootton Parkway. MD355 intersects MD 660 (Dodge Street), which is a short connector to MD 28 (Veirs Mill Road) that the route intersects a short distance later.|$|E
5|$|The two routes {{serve as}} Oneonta's main street, {{following}} Chestnut and Main streets across the city's western and central areas. Along the way, NY7 and NY23 pass Hartwick College and serve Oneonta's central business district. NY23 breaks from NY7 just northeast of downtown to follow James F. Lettis Highway, a four-lane divided highway, south into the southern {{half of the}} city. As it heads south on the arterial, it connects to Interstate88 (I-88) at an interchange on the northern bank of the Susquehanna River. NY28—which overlaps with I-88 from Oneonta to exit17 northeast of the city—leaves the freeway here, following NY23 across the river to a large commercial district on the south bank. NY28 leaves NY23 here to proceed to the southwest while NY23 goes eastward past several large <b>strip</b> <b>malls</b> and big-box retailers on {{its way out of}} both Oneonta and Otsego County.|$|E

50|$|Northern Lights Shopping Center is a <b>strip</b> <b>mall</b> {{located in}} Economy, Pennsylvania near Pittsburgh. While it {{continues}} {{to serve as a}} traditional community-style <b>strip</b> <b>mall</b> for the immediate area, it was a major power center-style <b>strip</b> <b>mall</b> from its opening until the early 2000s. Due to the high vacancy rate at the plaza, it is today largely considered a dead mall. A Walmart that opened next door to Northern Lights in 2014 is expected to help revitalize the plaza as well as help dilapidated southern Beaver County, although parts of the plaza are scheduled to be demolished by 2018.|$|R

25|$|Port of Spain's diverse {{population}} reflects {{two centuries of}} immigration and this shows in the architecture of its buildings. The city features French colonial 'ginger bread' style houses, buildings with New Orleans reminiscent wrought-iron railings and wooden fretwork set beside modern high-rise towers and <b>strip</b> <b>malls</b> with a mish-mash of gothic-style cathedrals, mosques and Hindu temples testifying to the diversity of cultures. It is home to African, Indian, French, English, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Venezuelan, Chinese and Syrian immigrants, most of them arriving since the Spanish Cedula of Population of 1783. Prominent Port of Spain citizens include Derek Walcott (Nobel Prize Literature 1992) and former West Indies cricketer Brian Lara.|$|E
25|$|Roughly {{half of the}} university's {{students}} {{volunteer in}} community-service programs in neighborhoods around campus and throughout Los Angeles. These outreach programs, as well as previous administrations' commitment to remaining in South Los Angeles amid widespread calls to move the campus following the 1965 Watts Riots, are credited {{for the safety of}} the university during the 1992 Los Angeles Riots. (That the university emerged from the riots completely unscathed is all the more remarkable in light of the complete destruction of several <b>strip</b> <b>malls</b> in the area, including one just across Vermont Avenue from the campus's western security fence.)

25|$|U.S. Route 17, {{also known}} as George Washington Memorial Highway, is the primary {{thoroughfare}} of Yorktown. It carries traffic via the George P. Coleman Memorial Bridge across the York River. York County has grown rapidly, and since the late 20th century, the stretch of U.S. 17 that passes through this area has become a heavily traveled route on which numerous <b>strip</b> <b>malls</b> and commercial areas have been developed. Many of the residential areas of York County branch off Route 17 or are near Interstate 64. Little of the recent residential or business development of York County has occurred close to Yorktown. It is being protected and managed as a historical colonial village, much like Williamsburg, {{under the guidance of}} the National Park Service.|$|E

25|$|During {{the process}} of {{drafting}} the plan, many residents expressed a desire for a national chain retailer or restaurant to be enticed to locate near or in downtown as a draw. The plan considers this ill-advised and unlikely to happen for several reasons. Chains {{do not like to}} pioneer a new area, instead preferring to cluster with each other, and this leads to the development of large <b>strip</b> <b>malls,</b> impractical and undesirable in downtown Ossining, which still shows the scars of previous demolitions for urban renewal. Ossining as a whole is also geographically undesirable for chains, since not only is it neither affluent enough or accessible enough from major highways, the Hudson River cuts the potential trade area for such stores in half.|$|E
25|$|After {{crossing}} {{under the}} railroad tracks, NY107 bends northeast on Hicksville Road, passing a second {{parking lot for}} the station. After a bend to the northwest at Michigan Avenue, the route remains a two-lane residential street, After an intersection with Ontario Street, the route passes a commercial stretch {{on the western side}} of the roadway and into an intersection with the eastern terminus of NY105 (Jerusalem Avenue). NY107 continues northward, passing some <b>strip</b> <b>malls</b> before proceeding northwest, passing a mix of residences and businesses. The route remains two-lanes and soon becomes primarily residential as it turns northward through the North Massapequa section of Oyster Bay. Just after the intersection with Alken Avenue, NY107 enters a partial cloverleaf interchange with Southern State Parkway (exit29).|$|E
25|$|Past the swamp, NY481 serves more {{developed}} {{areas of the}} town, running alongside a cluster of housing tracts {{on the outskirts of}} a large retail area centered around the highway's junction with NY31. The commercial district comprises several <b>strip</b> <b>malls</b> and the Great Northern Mall, the latter situated northeast of the NY31 interchange. From here, the freeway heads through markedly less developed areas, running across farmland to reach the Oneida River (Erie Canal) at the northern edge of Onondaga County. It continues across the waterway into the Oswego County town of Schroeppel, where it connects to County Route57A (CR57A) at a half-diamond interchange east of the village of Phoenix. NY481 continues to run across undeveloped areas of fields and forests, even as it passes close to Phoenix.|$|E
