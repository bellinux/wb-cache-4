Using Tucker and Zarowin &# 40;TZ&# 41; income <b>smoothing</b> statistic <b>and</b> variance of changes in earnings and also using the simulation and bootstrapping methods, this paper studies the income smoothing behavior, earnings persistence and earnings predictability in Tehran Stock Exchange &# 40;TSE&# 41; from 2002 {{to the end of}} 2007. The analysis of {{the relationship between}} earnings <b>smoothing</b> <b>and</b> earnings predictability &# 40;earnings persistence&# 41; relies on commonly used autoregressive regressions of current on one&# 45;year lagged earnings. Consistent with existing literature, results indicate widely held managerial beliefs that smoothing earnings increases the earnings predictability and earnings persistence...|$|R

5|$|Gould's most {{significant}} contribution to evolutionary biology was the theory of punctuated equilibrium, which he developed with Niles Eldredge in 1972. The theory proposes that most evolution is characterized by long periods of evolutionary stability, which is infrequently punctuated by swift periods of branching evolution. The theory was contrasted against phyletic gradualism, the popular idea that evolutionary change {{is marked by a}} pattern of <b>smooth</b> <b>and</b> continuous change in the fossil record.|$|E

Both the cheilocystidia (cystidia {{found on the}} edges of the gills) and the pleurocystidia (cystidia found on the faces of the gills) are spindle- or bottle-shaped, with some kind of encrustation at the tip. They have thick cell walls.|$|E

5|$|Leaves : Simple, entire (<b>smooth</b> <b>and</b> even), linear, oval to {{filiform}} (thread-like), {{mostly with}} parallel veins, but occasionally net-veined. They are alternate (single and alternating direction) and spiral, {{but may be}} whorled (three or more attached at one node, e.g. Lilium, Fritillaria), cauline (arranged along the aerial stem) or sheathed in a basal rosette. They are rarely petiolate (stem attached before apex), and lack stipules. The aerial stem is unbranched.|$|E

A field study by Jan Lewis and colleagues found that only females bore brood patches, suggesting they alone incubated eggs.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the H, fixed-lag <b>smoothing</b> <b>and</b> pre-diction problems for linear continuous-time systems. We first present {{a solution to}} the optimal HZ estimation problem for linear continuous-time systems with instantaneous and delayed measurements.

Therefore, the H 2 esti-mation is extended to give conditions on the existence of a H, fixed-lag <b>smoother</b> <b>and</b> predictor based on innovation analysis and projection in Krein space and a solution for H, smoother or predictor is given in terms of a Riccati differ-ential equation and matrix differential equations. ...|$|R

5|$|The basidia are 15–25×3.5–5.5µm {{and have}} a slim, club-like shape. Each {{basidium}} features four sterigmata, each of which bear one spore. The spores' shape is slimly ellipsoidal or cylindrical. Their surface is <b>smooth</b> <b>and</b> their walls are thin. Although they are colourless and hyaline, the spores are amyloid, meaning they will turn bluish or purple when stained with Melzer's reagent. This characteristic differs from other very similar species, and this gave the genus its name.|$|E
