40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{provides a}} self-healing strategy {{to deal with}} catastrophic events such as simultaneous loss of several generating units or major transmission lines when power system vulnerability analysis indicates {{that the system is}} approaching an extreme emergency state. In our approach, the system is adaptively divided into smaller islands at a slightly reduced capacity with consideration of quick restoration. The basis for forming the islands is to minimize the load-generation imbalance in each island, thereby facilitating the restoration process. Then a carefully designed load shedding scheme based on the rate of frequency decline is applied to limit the extent of the disruption and expedite the restoration process. A slow coherency based islanding theory is provided. Issues regarding the linear and nonlinear applicability of the theory are discussed in detail. R-Rdot out of <b>step</b> <b>relay</b> is deployed to form the islands. The function of the relay can be enhanced with the help of phasor measurement technology and decision tree knowledge. An overall scheme including a new two-level load shedding scheme is proposed. The proposed scheme is tested on a 179 -bus, 29 -generator sample system and shows very good performance...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, I {{investigate}} {{dynamic and}} computational properties of prokaryotic signalling architectures {{commonly known as}} the Two Component Signalling networks and phosphorelays. The aim {{of this study is to}} understand the information processing capabilities of different prokaryotic signalling architectures by examining the dynamics they exhibit. I present original investigations into the dynamics of different phosphorelay architectures and identify network architectures that include a commonly found four step phosphorelay architecture with a capacity for tuning its steady state output to implement different signal-response behaviours viz. sigmoidal and hyperbolic response. Biologically, this tuning can be implemented through physiological processes like regulating total protein concentrations (e. g. via transcriptional regulation or feedback), altering reaction rate constants through binding of auxiliary proteins on relay components, or by regulating bi-functional activity in relays which are mediated by bifunctional histidine kinases. This study explores the importance of different biochemical arrangements of signalling networks and their corresponding response dynamics. Following investigations into the significance of various biochemical reactions and topological variants of a four <b>step</b> <b>relay</b> architecture, I explore the effects of having different types of proteins in signalling networks. I show how multi-domain proteins in a phosphorelay architecture with multiple phosphotransfer steps occurring on the same protein can exhibit multistability through a combination of double negative and positive feedback loops. I derive a minimal multistable (core) architecture and show how component sharing amongst networks containing this multistable core can implement computational logic (like AND, OR and ADDER functions) that allows cells to integrate multiple inputs and compute an appropriate response. I examine the genomic distribution of single and multi domain kinases and annotate their partner response regulator proteins across prokaryotic genomes to find the biological significance of dynamics that these networks embed and the processes they regulate in a cell. I extract data from a prokaryotic two component protein database and take a sequence based functional annotation approach to identify the process, function and localisation of different response regulators as signalling partners in these networks. In summary, work presented in this thesis explores the dynamic and computational properties of different prokaryotic signalling networks and uses them to draw an insight into the biological significance of multidomain sensor kinases in living cells. The thesis concludes with a discussion on how this understanding of the dynamic and computational properties of prokaryotic signalling networks can be used to design synthetic circuits involving different proteins comprising two component and phosphorelay architectures.

The major use for these devices was in early automatic telephone exchanges to route telephone calls. It can step on one axis (called a uniselector), or on two axes (a Strowger switch). As the first automated telephone switch using electromagnets and hat pins, stepping switches were invented by Almon Brown Strowger in 1888. Strowger filed his patent application on March 12, 1889, and it was issued on March 10, 1891.|$|R

5000|$|During the 1940s - 1960s, Raymond Scott, an American {{composer}} {{of electronic}} music, invented various {{kind of music}} sequencers for his electric compositions.

Also, the rotating speed of arm was controlled via brightness of lights, and as the results, arbitrary rhythms were generated.|$|R
50|$|Strowger also {{filed the}} first patent for a rotary dial in 1891. The first dials worked by direct, forward action. The pulses were sent as the user rotated the dial to the finger stop {{starting}} {{at a different}} position for each digit transmitted. Operating the dial error-free required smooth rotary motion of the finger wheel by the user, but was found as too unreliable. This mechanism was soon refined to include a recoil spring and a centrifugal governor to control the recoil speed. The user selected a digit to be dialed by inserting a finger into the corresponding hole and rotated the dial to the finger stop. When released from this position, the dial pulsing contacts were opened and closed repeatedly, thus interrupting the loop current in a pattern on the return to the home position. The exchange switch decoded the pattern for each digit thus transmitted by <b>stepping</b> <b>relays</b> or by accumulation in digit registers.|$|R

40|$|The   6 – 35  kV  power-grid  current  protection  serves  to  protect  the  transmission  lines against phase-to-phase short-circuits. The major {{disadvantage}} of {{it lies in}} the relatively large time delays of the last stages especially in the main sections of the grid owing to the <b>stepped</b> <b>relay</b> characteristics {{as well as a}} large number of the steps. A full-fledged protection of the 6 – 35 kV lines against inter-phase short circuits can be provided by the two-stage current protection: the first stage being the current cutoff without any time delay and the second stage – the maximum current protection where the time delay is linear contingent on the distance between the protection placement and the fault-point location. The article introduces the rating formulae for the time delays of the second-stage and their exemplary graphic presentation. The authors offer a variant for solving the problem with computation of the second-stage time delays in those instances where several feeders diverge from the bus bars of the substation located in the end of the protected line. Improving current protections for the 6 – 35 kV transmission lines with one-end power supply against interphase short-circuits can be based on the collective application of the following principles: accounting for the type and location of the short-circuit which provides for the high-performance cutoff zone instantaneous expansion and its independence on the mode of failure and the grid operation mode. It also allows increase of the last stage sensitiveness towards asymmetrical short-circuits; detection of the short-circuit location only on the results of fault currents measurement which simplifies the protection implementation; realization of the last (second) protection stage with linear-dependent time delay which ensures potentiality of its operation speed increase. </p...|$|R
40|$|Motivated by the {{increasing}} demand for higher throughput, broader coverage and higher-level quality of service (QoS), a major effort is being made to study the relaying technology in wireless networks. However, most existing research on investigatingthe relaying performance over wireless fading channels typically rely on simplifying assumptions, such as perfect channel state information (CSI) and infinite blocklength, which may be inaccurate in realistic wireless systems. In this dissertation, we contribute to developing more extensive and systematical investigation models of relaying. On one hand, both the physical-layer and the higher-layer performance models of relaying are developed while multiple performance metrics are taken into account, e. g., reliability, capacity and energy efficiency. On the other hand, various scenarios with different assumptions regarding CSI and blocklength (e. g., perfect or imperfect CSI and finite or infinite blocklengths) are considered. In general, the following fundamental questions are addressed based on our investigation models: Does relaying become more efficient or pay off less under these scenarios with more realistic assumptions (e. g., imperfect CSI or/and finite blocklengths) ? What are performance differences {{if we do not}} consider or only consider one of these realistic assumptions? Is it essential to consider these realistic assumptions? What can we suggest for designing relaying systems especially for realistic applications?We achieve the above ultimate aim and find answers for these fundamental questions by two steps. In the first step, we investigate above performance metrics of relaying networks in the infinite blocklength regime (where blocklengths are infinite) and in thefinite blocklength regime (where blocklengths are finite), respectively. In particular, both the perfect CSI scenario and the imperfect CSI scenario are considered. In other words, by this <b>step</b> <b>relaying</b> performance models are studied under different assumptionsregarding CSI and blocklength, respectively. In the second step, we simulatively compare these relaying performance models under different scenarios/assumptions. By these two steps, we finally observe some surprising performance advantages of relayingin the finite blocklength regime (in comparison to in the infinite blocklength regime) and conclude a set of important guidelines for the design of efficient relaying systems...|$|R

40|$|A new two-way {{transmission}} protocol termed VMNC-SARQ (Virtual MIMO Network Coding with Superposition ARQ) {{was proposed}} in this paper, which could improve throughput efficiency of DF (Decode-and Forward) relay network signally.

30|$|In {{the second}} <b>step,</b> the <b>relay</b> {{transmitter}} nodes are grouped into different sets. Each relay set transmits on its corresponding dedicated frame. This grouping of transmitters {{is based on}} the condition of realizing very low interference mutually and in practice can be done in two ways. The first way is static, wherein the global positioning system coordinates of the transmitters can be used to work out the inter-transmitter distance and thereby find the relays which are sufficiently out of range. The second and more robust way is dynamic, wherein a central controller or the base station obtains interference reports from the users of each respective relay. Thereafter any two relays (r 1,r 2) are decided to be mutually non-interfering only if all the users of r 1 report very low interference from r 2 and vice versa. We provide a simple algorithm called SUFFICIENTGROUPING which can be applied for the case of interference reports.|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, we {{consider}} a wireless network consisting of d source-destination pairs and R relaying nodes. Each source wishes {{to communicate to}} its corresponding desti-nation. By exploiting the spatial multiplexing capability of the wireless medium, we develop two cooperative beamforming schemes {{in order to establish}} wireless connec-tions between multiple source-destination pairs through a collaborative relay network.

As a result, each relay re-ceives a noisy faded mixture of all source signals.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of a {{multi-user}} relay network, where multiple single-antenna node pairs want to exchange information by using a multiple antenna relay node. Due to the half-duplex constraint of the relay, the exchange of information takes place in two steps.

In this paper, we propose a novel cooperative diversity method that can achieve fair and efficient resource allocation. We shall show that fairness cannot be achieved by using fixed sets of relays in general. A multi-state cooperation method, where the relay set of each node can be changed, is then proposed to solve this problem. In this proposed approach, the energy is allocated among the nodes via a finite step iterative algorithm. In each <b>step,</b> the <b>relay</b> sets of nodes are changed so that each step will generate a cooperation state, which characterizes the cooperation relationship among the nodes. Based on the energy allocation result, the duration of each state is then optimized so as to minimize the outage probability.
