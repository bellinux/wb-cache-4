5|$|A gas-station scene {{within the}} episode {{was meant to}} {{establish}} what the brothers and the series are about—bantering, credit card <b>scams,</b> and classic rock; Kripke feared {{that it would be}} cut because it was character-based and did not further the episode's plot. He also did not want the series to feature ballad music typical of The WB network, and forced the use of classic rock for the soundtrack by writing the music into the script. For the episode's villain, Kripke used the well-known urban legend of the vanishing hitchhiker, but combined it with the Mexican legend of La Llorona to give the spirit more motivation and characterization. The ghost was younger in an earlier version of script, and murdered her parents instead of her children; this was revised to allow for the casting of an older actress.|$|E

To lessen the suspicion of fraudulent activities, <b>scam</b> messages sent by the same individual, or collaborating group, augment the text of their messages and assume an endless number of pseudonyms with {{an equal number of}} different stories. In this paper, we introduce ScamSlam, a software system designed to learn the underlying number criminal cells perpetrating a particular type of <b>scam,</b> as well as to identify which <b>scam</b> spam messages were written by which cell.
