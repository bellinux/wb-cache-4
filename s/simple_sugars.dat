40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} the issue of {{consumption}} of <b>simple</b> <b>sugar</b> and the psychological and behavioral aspects related to addictive behavior. The aim {{of the study was to}} explore and describe whether and how selected behavioral and psychological symptoms are affected by change in the consumption of <b>simple</b> <b>sugar.</b> Data were obtained by semistructured interview and administration of questionnaires. Two questionnaires SCL- 90 and the Food frequency questionnaire were used. The research sample was divided into two groups. First - control group are individuals who routinely consume food in which is usually <b>simple</b> <b>sugar.</b> Second - quasiexperimental group are individuals who have at least two years without <b>simple</b> <b>sugar</b> intake. Because of specificity of the selection criteria and in regard to validity of the quasiexperimental group were selected among individuals consuming a macrobiotic diet. Respondents completed an interview and filled out questionnaires within one meeting. Based on data analysis, it was found that individuals who consume sugar showed less psychopathological symptoms according SCL- 90, after elimination of sugar also showed more characteristics of addictive behavior in relation to a <b>simple</b> <b>sugar</b> than the control group. Changes after the elimination of <b>simple</b> <b>sugar</b> were most commonly associated [...] ...|$|R

5|$|Macromolecules such as starch, {{cellulose}} or proteins {{cannot be}} rapidly {{taken up by}} cells and must be broken into their smaller units {{before they can be}} used in cell metabolism. Several common classes of enzymes digest these polymers. These digestive enzymes include proteases that digest proteins into amino acids, as well as glycoside hydrolases that digest polysaccharides into <b>simple</b> <b>sugars</b> known as monosaccharides.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{treatment}} of gastroenteritis in {{both children and}} adults is rehydration. This is preferably achieved by drinking rehydration solution, although intravenous delivery may be required {{if there is a}} decreased level of consciousness or if dehydration is severe. Drinking replacement therapy products made with complex carbohydrates (i.e. those made from wheat or rice) may be superior to those based on <b>simple</b> <b>sugars.</b> Drinks especially high in <b>simple</b> <b>sugars,</b> such as soft drinks and fruit juices, are not recommended in children under 5 years of age as they may increase diarrhea. Plain water may be used if more specific ORT preparations are unavailable or the person is not willing to drink them. A nasogastric tube can be used in young children to administer fluids if warranted. In those who require intravenous fluids, one to four hours' worth is often sufficient.|$|E
5|$|An insect {{uses its}} {{digestive}} system to extract nutrients and other substances {{from the food}} it consumes. Most of this food is ingested {{in the form of}} macromolecules and other complex substances like proteins, polysaccharides, fats and nucleic acids. These macromolecules must be broken down by catabolic reactions into smaller molecules like amino acids and <b>simple</b> <b>sugars</b> before being used by cells of the body for energy, growth, or reproduction. This break-down process is known as digestion.|$|E

5|$|A {{food web}} is the archetypal {{ecological}} network. Plants capture solar energy {{and use it}} to synthesize <b>simple</b> <b>sugars</b> during photosynthesis. As plants grow, they accumulate nutrients and are eaten by grazing herbivores, and the energy is transferred through a chain of organisms by consumption. The simplified linear feeding pathways that move from a basal trophic species to a top consumer is called the food chain. The larger interlocking pattern of food chains in an ecological community creates a complex food web. Food webs are a type of concept map or a heuristic device that is used to illustrate and study pathways of energy and material flows.|$|E
5|$|The {{vegetative}} stage encompasses those {{phases of}} the life cycle involved with the germination, spread, and survival of the mycelium. Spores germinate under suitable conditions of moisture and temperature, and grow into branching filaments called hyphae, pushing out like roots into the rotting wood. These hyphae are homokaryotic, containing a single nucleus in each compartment; they increase in length by adding cell-wall material to a growing tip. As these tips expand and spread to produce new growing points, a network called the mycelium develops. Mycelial growth occurs by mitosis and the synthesis of hyphal biomass. When two homokaryotic hyphae of different mating compatibility groups fuse with one another, they form a dikaryotic mycelia in a process called plasmogamy. Prerequisites for mycelial survival and colonization a substrate (like rotting wood) include suitable humidity and nutrient availability. The majority of Cyathus species are saprobic, so mycelial growth in rotting wood is made possible by the secretion of enzymes that break down complex polysaccharides (such as cellulose and lignin) into <b>simple</b> <b>sugars</b> that can be used as nutrients.|$|E
25|$|Insulin is {{produced}} in the pancreas and the Brockmann body (in some fish), and released when any of several stimuli are detected. These stimuli include ingested protein and glucose in the blood produced from digested food. Carbohydrates can be polymers of <b>simple</b> <b>sugars</b> or the <b>simple</b> <b>sugars</b> themselves. If the carbohydrates include glucose, then that glucose will be absorbed into the bloodstream and blood glucose level will begin to rise. In target cells, insulin initiates a signal transduction, which {{has the effect of}} increasing glucose uptake and storage. Finally, insulin is degraded, terminating the response.|$|E

25|$|Amylases {{are used}} in {{breadmaking}} and to break down complex sugars, such as starch (found in flour), into <b>simple</b> <b>sugars.</b> Yeast then feeds on these <b>simple</b> <b>sugars</b> and converts it into the waste products of alcohol and CO2. This imparts flavour and causes the bread to rise. While amylases are found naturally in yeast cells, it takes time for the yeast to produce enough of these enzymes to break down significant quantities of starch in the bread. This {{is the reason for}} long fermented doughs such as sour dough. Modern breadmaking techniques have included amylases (often in the form of malted barley) into bread improver, thereby making the process faster and more practical for commercial use.|$|E
25|$|Prostatic {{secretions}} vary among species. They {{are generally}} composed of <b>simple</b> <b>sugars</b> {{and are often}} slightly alkaline. In human prostatic secretions, the protein content is less than 1% and includes proteolytic enzymes, prostatic acid phosphatase, beta-microseminoprotein, and prostate-specific antigen. The secretions also contain zinc with a concentration 500–1,000 times the concentration in blood.|$|E

50|$|The comet was {{observed}} to release 21 different organic molecules in gas, including ethanol and glycolaldehyde, a <b>simple</b> <b>sugar.</b> The presence of organic molecules {{suggests that they}} are preserved materials synthesized in {{the outskirts of the}} solar nebula or at earlier stages of the Solar System formation.|$|R
25|$|Various factors {{influence}} copper absorption. For example, copper absorption {{is enhanced}} by ingestion of animal protein, citrate, and phosphate. Copper salts, including copper gluconate, copper acetate, or copper sulfate, are more easily absorbed than copper oxides. Elevated levels of dietary zinc, as well as cadmium, high intakes of phytate and <b>simple</b> <b>sugars</b> (fructose, sucrose) inhibit dietary absorption of copper.

25|$|Other {{elimination}} diets {{have also}} been proposed, targeting salicylates, food dyes, yeast, and <b>simple</b> <b>sugars.</b> No scientific evidence has established the efficacy of such diets in treating autism in children. An elimination diet may create nutritional deficiencies that harm overall health unless care is taken to assure proper nutrition. For example, a 2008 study found that autistic boys on casein-free diets have significantly thinner bones than usual, presumably because the diets contribute to calcium and vitamin D deficiencies.|$|E
5000|$|A triose is a monosaccharide, or <b>simple</b> <b>sugar,</b> {{containing}} three carbon atoms.
