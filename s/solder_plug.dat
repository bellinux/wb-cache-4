2500|$|In the mid-20th century, a few milk {{products}} were packaged in nearly rimless cans, reflecting different construction; in this case, one flat surface had a hole (for filling the nearly complete can) that was sealed after filling with a quickly solidifying drop of molten solder. [...] Concern arose that the milk contained unsafe levels of lead leached from this <b>solder</b> <b>plug.</b>|$|E
40|$|The figure {{depicts the}} main {{parts of a}} {{prototype}} miniature, lightweight, onetime- opening valve. Like some other miniature one-time-opening valves reported in previous issues of NASA Tech Briefs, this valve is opened by melting a material that blocks the flow path. This valve is designed to remain closed at some temperature between room temperature and cryogenic temperature until the time of opening. The prototype valve includes a 1 / 8 -in. (3 -mm) aluminum tube, one end of which is plugged with a solder comprising about 37 weight percent of lead and 63 weight percent of tin. The tube and the solder both have a {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} of 23 micron/m-K at room temperature. Before plugging, the interior surface of the plug end of the tube is cleaned with a commercial flux paste developed specifically for preparing aluminum for bonding with lead/tin solder. The solder is then melted into the cleaned end of the tube, forming the plug. In a test, the plugged tube was pressurized to 1, 000 psi (6. 9 MPa) with helium and leak-tested. It was then cooled to a temperature of 77 K (about 196 C) and again leak-tested at the same pressure. Finally, at a lower pressure, the plugged end of the tube was heated to about 200 C (the melting temperature of the solder is 183 C), causing the <b>solder</b> <b>plug</b> to be ejected (see figure). It has been estimated that in a subsequent version of the valve, the plug could be melted by electrical heating, using a nichrome wire having a mass of only 10 g...|$|E

3000|$|The Seebeck {{coefficient}} (S) is {{a measure}} of the magnitude of an induced thermoelectric voltage in response to a temperature difference across the material (i.e., S[*]=[*]−[*]ΔV/ΔT). We measured S by using the setup shown in Fig.  1 a. For creating a temperature difference between the bottom copper plug and the top copper plug, a TEG was plugged into a DC voltage source and set at 2.334  V (Fig.  2 a). The thermocouples, along with soldered copper wires, were connected to a data collection unit interfaced to LabVIEW to allow measurement of voltage and temperature difference between the copper plugs (Fig.  2 a). The source was then turned on for 90  s. After 90  s, measurements of voltage and temperature difference were taken until the temperature difference between the copper plugs was ΔT[*]≥[*] 5  K (Fig.  2 a). The thermocouples monitored the temperature gradient across the particles, and the copper wires <b>soldered</b> to the <b>plugs</b> read the S voltage produced. The data collected in LabVIEW was then plotted to determine the S coefficient, and a typical measurement for sample S 4 is shown in Fig.  2 b (i.e., S[*]=[*]−[*] 313 μV/K at a resistance of R [...]...|$|R
40|$|Dispensing {{solder paste}} with {{automated}} dispensing equipment provides many challenges {{that must be}} overcome before a production process can be considered robust. The primary challenge to overcome is the tendency for <b>solder</b> paste to <b>plug</b> in dispensing pumps and needles. This paper outlines the important process parameters that must be determined and controlled for good production robustness, including the selection of valve or pump technology, selection of dispensing needles, selection of solder paste packaging, generic equipment settings, and paste formulation. In particular, the effect and interdependence of solder paste mesh size, % metal content, and alloy of metal is discussed. Many production facilities have overcome these problems, only to have them re-appear when switching to a lead free solder formulation. This paper {{will focus on the}} formulation of solder paste for robust dispensing and how that formulation must be altered when lead free alloys are used. A theoretical model showing recommended % metal content as a function of alloy is presented, with consideration to mesh size and uniformity. This model is then applied to lead free formulations to give the reader an understanding of the formulation for specific alloys a...|$|R
40|$|Organic {{substrate}} is {{a composite}} panel consists of several materials such as BT core, copper, dielectric, <b>solder</b> resist and <b>plugging</b> material. As different material has different material property, when the organic substrate is exposed to thermal excursion in the manufacturing process, the substrate warps. In this project, both experimental and simulation study were carried out {{in order to have}} a better understanding on the substrate warpage behaviour during the solder reflow process. In the experimental analysis, substrate warpage throughout the solder reflow process was measured by using shadow moirÃ©. Besides that, the thermally induced warpage due to the temperature rise was obtained by subtracting the measured warpage from the initial warpage. Finite element analysis was performed to predict the thermally induced warpage during the solder reflow process. Both results from the experiment and simulation were compared in order to validate the finite element models. A parametric study of the impact of design parameters and material properties on substrate warpage during the solder reflow process was performed. A total of 6 parameters have been investigated including material properties, copper volume, copper distribution, plated through hole (PTH) number, PTH array and substrate thickness. The results of these analyses have produced general guidelines which can be refer when designing the substrate and also selecting the substrate materials. ...|$|R
40|$|The Global Trigger {{is part of}} the Level- 1 Trigger of the CMS {{experiment}} at CERN, {{with the}} task to find the most interesting events corresponding to a rate of 100 kHz from the basic Large Hadron Collider interaction rate of 40 MHz. It is expected to render a decision within 3 : 2 μs, which necessitates an implementation using custom hardware. The implementation makes heavy use of Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology to reconcile the performance requirements with the need for exibility. The complexity of the Global Trigger system (13 boards with 51 FPGA chips) makes it vulnerable to a multitude of errors, from electrical errors such as bad <b>solder</b> joints or <b>plug</b> contacts up to logical errors in the implementation of the firmrmware and the configuration software. The goal of the work described in this thesis was to provide an integrated system that allows users to easily determine whether the system is working correctly and assists experts in tracking down the internal causes of such errors {{within the context of the}} Level- 1 Trigger Online Control infrastructure. The operation of the testing system was validated on the basis of errors uncovered in the physics data collected during data taking on cosmic radiation in July and August 2009. The results demonstrate the importance of an easily available testing infrastructure and its integration into the experiment's operating procedure...|$|R
