50|$|A severe {{outbreak}} of the disease <b>strongylosis</b> in grey partridges in 1931 led Major HG Eley (a shotgun cartridge manufacturer) to establish the ICI Game Research Station at Knebworth in Hertfordshire. The organisation monitored partridge numbers and investigated their biology.|$|E
50|$|The {{red grouse}} may be {{infected}} by parasites and viruses which severely affect populations. <b>Strongylosis</b> or 'grouse disease' {{is caused by}} the strongyle worm, which induces damage and internal bleeding after burrowing into the cecum. This endoparasite is often eaten with the tops of young heather shoots and can lead to mortality and poor condition, including a decrease in the bird's ability to control the scent it emits.|$|E
50|$|This {{endoparasite}} {{causes a}} condition often called <b>strongylosis</b> or 'grouse disease' and {{which can be}} the cause of regular crashes in grouse populations. When the adult worm burrows into the caeca walls it causes a lot of damage and internal bleeding which in itself is harmful to the grouse. The worms ultimately reduce the digestive efficiency thus affecting the condition of the grouse.The eggs of the strongyle worm found in the caecal droppings of Red Grouse, hatch out into a microscopic larvae stage. Living within the dropping they feed off bacteria and organic matter they develop through two moults reaching their third larval stage, 'L3'. The 'L3' larvae is now at its infective stage so it 'swims' up heather stalks, on a thin film of liquid, to the young shoots where it is most likely to be ingested by a host. Once in the body of a host they enter one of the two caecum in the intestine of the host where the larvae develop into adult worms. The adults mate within the caeca and the female can lay over 100 eggs a day which are passed out in the caecal dropping.|$|E
40|$|A {{survey was}} carried out to {{determine}} the level of gastrointestinal parasite infections in cattle, sheep and goats in three Maasai group ranches (Olkarkar, Merueshi and Mbirikani) in Kajiadio District of Kenya. <b>Strongylosis</b> was the most prevalent gastrointestinal infection. Between 60 - 70 percent of the sheep and goats were infected with gastrointestinal parasites, while 40 percent of the cattle were infected. The rate of infection correlated with age in cattle {{with most of the}} cases occuring in calves which also suffered heavier parasitison. Coccidiosis was second to <b>strongylosis</b> in prevalence, mainly in calves, kids and lambs. Infection with other parasites was less than 6 percent...|$|E

40|$|Prevalence of {{gastrointestinal}} parasites {{was investigated}} using monthly faecal samples and necropsy data in sheep treated regularly and irregularly at ILCA, Debre Berhan station. Maximum infection rates with nematodes, fasciola and coccidia in the irregularly treated sheep were 18 percent, 10 percent and 37 percent, respectively, compared with 5 percent, 3 percent and 41 {{percent for the}} hosts treated regularly. <b>Strongylosis</b> was diagnosed mainly in July-Nov, fasciolosis in Jan-Jun and cocidiosis all the year round. Deworming with fenbendazole resulted in low worm -egg output and the abscence of helmianthiasis. Supplementary feeding of the untreated flock resulted in weight gains supirior to the treated group but at necropsy different species of helminth were encountered...|$|E
40|$|The present {{trial was}} aimed to compare {{efficiency}} of prevention of moniaziasis (Treatment Programme 1, TP 1) versus prevention of gastro-intestinal <b>strongylosis</b> (Treatment Programme 2, TP 2) in suckling lambs as assessed by clinical appearance and growing performance. Clinical observations and fecal egg counts {{were conducted on}} 397 three-month-old lambs born {{in the middle of}} the lambing season. Clinical signs suggestive of gastro-intestinal parasitism were found in 59 lambs (14. 9 percent) and 150 out of 213 analysed fecal samples (70. 4 percent) contained eggs of Moniezia. The twelve farms involved in the trial were paired following similarities in husbandry conditions. Ninety lambs from the farms under TP 1 were compared with 90 lambs from the farms under TP 2, following similarities of weight and sex. In the farms under TP 1, the lambs received a single dose of niclosamide, 80 mg/kg bodyweight (drug active against Moniezia only). In the farms under TP 2, the lambs received a single dose of morantel tartrate, 8 mg/kg bodyweight (drug active against gastro-intestinal nematodes only). Clinical symptoms, as assessed during two control visits carried out one and two month after the treatment, disappeared in farms under TP 1 and increased in the farms under TP 2. Eggs of Moniezia were no longer found in fecal samples of the flocks under TP 1 whereas the percentage of animals with eggs of Moniezia stabilized in the flocks under TP 2. Mean daily gains in the month following the treatment were 301 g in the flocks under TP 1 and 128 g in the flocks under TP 2. Mean daily gains in the next month were 178 g and 112 g in both groups, respectively. These results suggest that, in the conditions under study where gastro-intestinal <b>strongylosis</b> is controlled in the adult sheep, prevention of monieziasis must be regarded as the basis of the Herd Health Programme in the growing lambs...|$|E
40|$|Gastrointestinal <b>strongylosis</b> are the {{dominant}} parasitic infections of sheep and goats. The successful control of these parasites cannot be done exclusively with anthelmintics, {{but the first}} step is an integrated program for environmental prophylaxis. The correct planning of the prophylaxis program has to be preceded by the analysis of the related problems: (1) the parasitological status of farm livestock; (2) knowledge of the farm management; (3) hydrogeological, pedological and climatic-environmental aspects. The environmental control strategies can be resumed as follows: avoiding animals from different farms to share the same pasture; avoiding animals of different age classes to graze together; parcel the pastures to permit a rational rotation; rotational grazing of pastures according to the seasonal development of parasites; stocking rate; young animals grazing ahead of the older animai ones; crop management practices (draining, ploughing, harrowing, scrub clearing, fertilizing, etc.). These measures make the habitat less suitable for the free-living stages of gastrointestinal strongyles, reducing the potential of infection of the same pastures...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of medicated food pellets (containing 10 mg of ivermectin per kg, UNIFEED, Veronesi, Verona, Italy) was evaluated {{for the control}} of intestinal strongyles {{in a group of}} captive zebras (Equus burchelli) at the Safari Park, Fasano (Apulia region, Brindisi Province, southern Italy). The egg reappearance period and the faecal egg counts in terms of eggs per gram of faeces were investigated. From day 0 until day + 9, 30 zebras were fed with medicated pellets and pooled faecal samples were collected from the floor of paddocks. The drug showed an {{efficacy of}} 100 % for up to 78 days post-treatment, with one exception. Strongyle eggs collected prior to the treatment were used to perform coprocultures and larvae harvested were molecularly identified as Cylicostephanus minutus and Cylicocyclus leptostomum with a reverse line blot hybridization assay. The administration of ivermectin with medicated food pellets was effective in controlling intestinal <b>strongylosis</b> in captive zebras. The opportunity to treat captive ungulates with an in-feed anthelmintic is discussed in relation to the fractious nature of these animals, which often impairs helminth control programs in zoo-parks...|$|E
40|$|A coprological {{survey to}} {{determine}} the influence of some intrinsic factors (breed, age, and sex) on the infection by helminth parasites in equine livestock (n = 418) under an oceanic climate area (NW Spain) was conducted. Faecal samples were individually collected and analyzed by the coprological techniques. The main strongylid genera identified were Trichonema and Cyalocephalus spp (small strongyles) and Strongylus and Triodontophorus (large strongyles). The prevalence of gastrointestinal nematode was 89 % (95 % CI 86, 92) and 1 % cestoda (0, 2). The percentage of horses with strongyloid parasites was 89 % (86, 92), 11 % (8, 14) for Parascaris, and 3 % (1, 5) for Oxyuris. The highest prevalence for ascariosis was observed in the youngest horses (10 years animals, and for <b>strongylosis</b> in the 3 – 10 years ones. Females were significantly more parasitized than males. A negative correlation between the age and the egg-excretion of ascarids and strongyles was recorded. The autochthonous and the English Pure Blood horses were the most parasitized. We concluded that the infections by helminths, especially the strongyloids, are significantly common in the region, so that greater importance should be given to this situation...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of strongyle larvae in goat manure {{needs to be}} determined as some farmers recycle the manure to fertilise grasses grown for animal feed which may lead to <b>strongylosis.</b> Five plots of at least 1. 5 m apart were identified in grassy area. Faeces of goats with strongly infection diposited over a 24 -hour period were collected and deposited onto the plots. Faecal samples were collected daily in the morning from each plot until eggs and strongyle larvae were no longer detected. The samples were subjected tp faecal egg count (FEC), larvae identification and enumeration. The mean FEC of samples declined from 660 eggs per gram (epg) on Day 1 to zero epg on Day 4. Pre-infective larvae were found on Days 4 and 5. L 3 of Haemonchus contortus and Trichostrongylus sp. L 3 were observed until Day 21 and Day 22 respectively. Oesophagostomum sp. L 3 were absent by Day 16. Overall L 3 counts peaked on day 8 and were negligible by Day 14.

40|$|AbstractIntestinal strongyles (IS) are {{the most}} {{important}} parasites of equids, due to their high prevalence worldwide, pathogenicity and the spread of drug-resistant populations. Despite the large number of horses bred in Sardinia Island, Italy, no data are available on the efficacy of anthelmintic compounds in the control of horse <b>strongylosis.</b> Therefore the aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the efficacy of five commercial anthelmintic formulations containing fenbendazole (FBZ), pyrantel (PYR), moxidectin (MOX) and two ivermectin formulations (IVM 1 and IVM 2) against IS in Sardinia by performing a fecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) and investigating the egg reappearance period (ERP) after treatment. In total, 74 horses from 7 farms were examined. Coprocultures performed for individual fecal samples collected at the day of the treatment revealed that cyathostomins were the predominant parasitic species (98. 6 %). The FECR for all horses belonging to the treatment groups after two weeks was ≥ 95 % with a 95 % C. I. > 90 %. The expected ERP did not decrease in any of the treatment group as FECR values 90 % for the entire duration of the trial until D 150. The results of the present survey indicate that drug-resistant cyathostomin populations are not present in the examined horse population, contrariwise to what observed in other Italian and European regions. The reasons and implications of these results are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Dissertação de Mestrado Integrado em Medicina VeterináriaAs resistências às doenças parasitárias nos equídeos é um tema que suscita grande interesse na sociedade científica. A resistência aos helmintes gastrintestinais aumenta quando os equídeos envelhecem. Todavia, a presença de hipersensibilidades alérgicas também pode ser considerada um factor que promove uma diminuição da estrongilidose. O primeiro subtema do presente estudo baseou-se na epidemiologia da estrongilidose de garranos em pastoreio, no Instituto Superior de Agronomia de Lisboa (ISA) e no Parque Nacional da Peneda do Gerês (PNPG), focando as condições geoclimáticas e as características individuais. Nos garranos do ISA, durante os 6 meses do estudo, foi colhido um total de 42 amostras. As larvas do género Cyathostomum A foram as mais prevalentes (97, 6 %) e abundantes (61, 6 %), seguindo-se as do género Cyathostomum D com prevalência e abundância respectivamente, 52, 4 % e 18, 4 %. Para os garranos do PNPG, durante os 2 meses do estudo, colheram-se 39 amostras. As larvas com maior prevalência e abundância foram igualmente as do género Cyathostomum A e D. As larvas de Strongylus vulgaris foram mais prevalentes (71, 4 %) e abundantes (11, 6 %) para os garranos do ISA. O segundo subtema focou-se na presença ou ausência de hipersensibilidade e o tipo de hipersensibilidade, abrangendo 43 animais divididos por estes três grupos. A finalidade foi averiguar se situações de hipersensibilidade alérgica podem ou não promover diminuição da carga helmíntica. Portanto, comparou-se a média do logaritmo de OPG de estrongilídeos dos três grupos de equídeos obtendo: 0, 9 OPG para o grupo B 1 com ORVA e Dermatite atópica (n= 14), 2, 1 OPG para o grupo A sem sintomatologia alérgica (n= 19) e 3, 3 OPG para o grupo B 2 com Hipersensibilidade à picada de insectos (n= 10). Relativamente ao grau de infecção, 75 % dos equídeos do grupo B 1 apresentaram valores de OPG compatível com uma infecção fraca (< 450 OPG), seguindo o grupo A e o grupo B 2 com respectivamente, 25 % e 0 %. Para valores superiores 1000 OPG ou infecção grave, o grupo A apresentou 54, 5 %, seguindo-se o grupo B 2 e B 1 com respectivamente, 36, 4 % e 9, 1 % das amostras. Os resultados obtidos demonstram que equídeos mais velhos e equídeos com hipersensibilidade do tipo I tendem a ter uma menor carga parasitária. Isto promove uma menor necessidade de desparasitação. ABSTRACT - Two {{perspectives}} of the assessment of resistance to <b>strongylosis</b> infection in Portugal’s horses: garranos grazing and horses with allergic diseases - The resistance to parasitic diseases in horses is a topic with high interest in the scientific society. The resistance to gastrointestinal helminths increases when the horses get older. However, the presence of allergic hypersensitivities {{can also be considered}} as a factor which promotes a reduction in <b>strongylosis.</b> The first subtheme {{of the present study was}} based on the epidemiology of <b>strongylosis</b> of garranos grazing, in the Institute of Agronomy in Lisbon (ISA) and the National Park of Gerês (PNPG), focusing on the ecological conditions and individual characteristics. In ISA’s garranos during the six months of the study, a total of 42 faecal samples were collected. Cyathostomum A larvae were the most prevalent (97, 6 %) and abundant (61, 6 %), followed by Cyathostomum D with the prevalence and abundance respectively, 52, 4 % and 18, 4 %. For the PNPG’s garranos, during the two months of the study, 39 samples were recorded. Larvae with higher prevalence and abundance belonged also to genera Cyathostomum A and D. The larvae of Strongylus vulgaris were more prevalent (71, 4 %) and abundant (11, 6 %) for ISA’s garranos. The second subtheme focused on the study of 43 animals which were split into three groups in the presence or absence of hypersensitivity, and hypersensitivity type. The purpose was to determine whether cases of allergic hypersensitivity may or may not promote a decrease in helminth burden. Therefore, the average of EPG logarithm of these three groups of horses, was compared and the following values were obtained: 0, 9 EPG for Group B 1 and ORVA with atopic dermatitis (n= 14), 2, 1 EPG for group A with no allergic symptoms (n= 19) and 3, 3 EPG to group B 2 with Hypersensitivity to insect bites (n= 10). Regarding the degree of infection, 75 % equine of B 1 had EPG values compatible with low infection (< 450 EPG), following group A and group B 2 with respectively, 25 % and 0 %. For values higher than 1000 EPG or severe infection, group A showed 54, 5 %, followed by group B 2 and B 1 with respectively, 36, 4 % and 9, 1 % of samples. The results show that older horses and horses with hypersensitivity type I tend to have a lower parasite load. This promotes a reduced need for deworming...|$|E
40|$|<b>Strongylosis</b> in equids, {{despite being}} very common, {{have never been}} studied from a {{strictly}} ecological point of view. Mathematical models are important ecological tools used to study the temporal dynamics of parasite populations, and are useful to study the effect of different biological parameters, {{as well as to}} analyse the outcome produced by perturbations such as anthelmintic treatments. This work describes the study of the temporal dynamics of strongyles infection in an organic donkey population, performed using coprological quantitative analysis and donkeys’ age as a proxy of the time of infection. Force of infection was then estimated for Strongylus vulgaris and small strongyles and the results used {{as the basis for the}} development of mathematical models. In particular, the comparison of models output and field data made it possible to estimate the transmission coefficient  and to consequently calculate the basic reproduction number R 0 and the threshold host density. Small strongyles model includes hypobiosis and, more interestingly as never found in literature, a density-dependent development rate of hypobiotic larvae in adult parasites in order to simulate a negative feedback between larvae emergence from hypobiosis and adult parasite abundance. Simulations of pharmacological and environmental treatments showed that parasite eradication was possible for S. vulgaris only, while small strongyles, due to hypobiosis and density-dependent development rate of their hypobiotic larvae, are very difficult to control and impossible to eradicate. In addition, density-dependence in larval development has been demonstrated to act as a key factor in improving parasite population survival and abundance even in absence of human intervention. ...|$|E
40|$|The Effect of Albendazole Treatment on Gastrointestinal Helminthes and Productivity of Weaned Cattle in the Adamaoua Cameroon. A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effect of Albendazole treatment on gastrointestinal helminthes and productivity of weaned cattle (9 - 21 months) belonging to the semi-intensive livestock production system in the Adamaoua-Cameroon. Two herds of male cattle grazing in the locality of Mbaoré were chosen after a coprological survey achieved {{at the end of the}} rainy season on 355 individuals. In each herd, 30 animals were randomly selected to constitute the experimental group (EG) and the control group (CG). EG cattle were treated with 10 % albendazole (7. 5 mg/kg BW) at D 0. Fecal samples were collected and examined by the McMaster technique at D 0 and D 12 to assess the efficacy of the treatment. Thereafter, a coprological monitoring was conducted every 3 weeks from November 2013 to April 2014. A weight measuring tape was used to estimate the weight of the cattle at every faecal sampling day. Coprological examinations revealed that <b>strongylosis,</b> toxocarosis and trichurosis are the main gastro-intestinal helminthosis of young bovine with prevalences of 69. 57 %; 13. 64 %; 12. 14 % respectively. Results of the fecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) indicate a good efficacy of the anthelmintic used (FECRT> 90 %). Albendazole treatment at the beginning of the dry season has maintained the level of feacal egg output low throughout the dry season. The treatment with albendazole reduced the level of feacal egg gram (EPG) output to 50. 99 % in the EG compared to the CG (at the end of the season). A reduction of the seasonal weight loss (13. 22 %) was observed in the EG. However, there was no significant difference (P> 0. 05) of weight between the two groups...|$|E
40|$|Red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus are an {{important}} game species in the United Kingdom, with many areas of heather moorland managed specifically to produce them for driven shooting. In order to effectively manage red grouse populations {{it is important to}} have an understanding of their population dynamics and to determine which of the vital rates most effect population growth and recovery and whether these parameters can be influenced by management activities. The focus of my research was to provide a greater understanding of the respective roles of juvenile dispersal, heather management and mortality causes in red grouse population dynamics at a landscape scale in northern England. The study was undertaken between 1999 and 2005 and encompassed four privately owned grouse moors, covering some 113 km(^ 2) of heather dominated moorland. Central to my research was the ability to accurately and efficiently survey the distribution and abundance of red grouse across the study area. To facilitate this I evaluated a distance sampling method to survey red grouse across the study area pre-breeding in spring and post-breeding in summer. The distance sampling technique proved a reliable, repeatable and practical method for extensive surveys of red grouse. Grouse distribution data were used to construct spatial patterns of grouse abundance at a moor scale using a geostatistical interpolation technique. Rotational heather burning is practised by grouse moor managers to create a mosaic of heather ages which provide food, shelter and nesting habitats for red grouse. To assess the spatial and temporal effects of heather burning on grouse, I used an earth observation technique, using satellite remote sensing to map the habitat mosaic across all four study moors in 2000. Temporal effects of heather burning, from 2000 to 2005 were studied on one moor, with annual heather burning mapped annually. Dispersal is {{an important}} element of population dynamics which influences population growth and spread, gene flow and disease transmission. I used radio telemetry to investigate the timing, frequency and distances of dispersal in juvenile red grouse. Dispersal distance differed between sexes, with juvenile females dispersing on average 861 m (± 120 SE) compared to 343 m (± 31 SE) recorded in males. Population growth did not appear to be limited by dispersal and abundance increased until the density dependent effect of the parasitic nematode worm Trichostrongyle tenuis caused a population crash. On the study moors, grouse moor management resulted in rapid population growth with population oscillations caused by density dependent <b>strongylosis</b> induced crashes. The main cause of mortality was found to be shooting and to dampen population oscillations, modified shooting programmes to limit population growth in conjunction with parasite control measures should be adopted to better manage grouse populations.
