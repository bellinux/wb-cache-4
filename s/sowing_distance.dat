40|$|The {{amount of}} seeds per plant {{is one of}} the three {{features}} (besides density and seeds weight) conditioning seed production in agricultural crops. In its turn, density is influenced by the <b>sowing</b> <b>distance</b> between the rows and by the seeding rate. Using a lower seeding rate (5 kg/ha) has a stronger impact on the amount of seeds per plant in bird’sfoot trefoil compared to a larger rate (20 kg/ha). The analysis of the impact of trial factors on the amount of seeds per plant in Festuca rubra L. shows that the variants sowed at sowing distances of 12. 5 cm or 25 cm at a rate of 5 kg/ha ensure the highest increase of the amount of seeds per plant...|$|E

40|$|Our {{study used}} two {{consecutive}} years of aerial culling then molecular ecology techniques (microsatellite analysis) to obtain parentage {{data from a}} widely dispersed and low density feral pig population during drought conditions in the semi-arid rangelands of Australia. This data was analysed geo-spatially to provide estimates on the actual minimum movements of feral pigs. The aim of this exercise was to obtain data {{that could be used}} to improve models that investigate rates of disease spread. The derived data revealed that some individuals will move much greater distances than previously recorded. The maximum recorded movement was 143 km between a boar and pregnant sow in less than 1 year, with the mean boar to successfully mated <b>sow</b> <b>distance</b> being 43 km. Thus, home ranges in this situation could be assumed to be much larger than previously calculated. Movement models were developed from this data and were based upon three assumptions of home range affinity; fixed home range, moving home range and no home range. Mean daily movements generated were 3 km linear distance away from a previous mating for boars. Models revealed that currently planned disease eradication zones for Australia may be inadequate if an exotic disease outbreak remains undetected for only a short period of time (1 week). Using previously generated deterministic models for foot–and-mouth disease spread, and this data to alter home range size, the threshold population density below which disease will not transmit declines markedly...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{presents}} two sowing {{machines for}} interval sowing, differing {{in the mode}} of operation. The pneumatic vacuum sowing machine OLT and the pneumatic pressure sowing machine Aeromat - Becker for sowing sugar beet are compared. We were interested in adequacy of sowing at different working speeds. The purpose of the paper is to find out the optimum working speed for the individual sowing machine. Design/methodology/approach: The measurements were performed with two sowing machines which are most widely used in Slovenia; the sowing machines were tested in completely identical conditions at different speeds of sowing. Findings: The parameters such as working efficiency, depth of sowing, inter - row distance and distance between seeds in the sowing row were measured and calculated. Research limitations/implications: Cultivation of sugar beet depends primarily on expert and technically correct <b>sowing.</b> <b>Distance</b> between seeds in the sowing row must enable the plants to have optimum conditions for their growth and development. For successful sowing it is necessary to know adequacy of the soil for sowing, technical properties of the sowing machine and biotechnical characteristics of the seed. Practical implications: Sowing machines and expertly performed sowing are of great importance for cultivation of sugar beet. The principal aim of the paper is to establish whether the higher working speed influences the quality of sowing. The tests were aimed at defining the most suitable sowing speed for both sowing machines on the basis of measured data. Cultivation of sugar beet requires much money invested and work performed per unit of area. It is very important for the producers to be well familiarized with all agro - technical measures. Originality/value: Taking into account all measured parameters the optimum sowing speed of the pneumatic vacuum machine OLT is 8 km/h and the optimum sowing speed of the pneumatic pressure sowing machine Aeromat - Becker is 10 km/h...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of topsoil texture and chemistry on long-term patterns of seedling recruitment in Lavandula latifolia (Labiatae), an evergreen Mediterranean shrub. The questions addressed are: (1) Are spatial patterns of seedling emergence and survival probabilities related to spatial variation in soil properties? (2) Are the two components of recruitment similarly influenced by the same soil parameters or, alternatively, are they influenced in different ways and/or by different soil parameters? (3) If the latter applies, then do the sets of soil parameters influencing emergence and survival show congruent patterns of spatial variation? Seed progenies from fourteen maternal families were sown at ten widely spaced field sites (between-site distances in the scale of a few kilometers). Sites differed in average soil characteristics. There was also considerable variation in some soil parameters within <b>sowing</b> sites (<b>distances</b> between soil sampling points in the scale of meters). The seedling recruitment process was monitored for six years. Both the probability of one seed of L. latifolia giving rise to an emerged seedling, and the probability of an emerged seedling remaining alive six years past emergence and entering the juvenile age class, {{were significantly related to}} topsoil properties. Seedling emergence and survival tended to be influenced by largely non-overlapping sets of soil properties that were related, respectively, to texture- and fertility-related gradients. These two soil gradients tended to be uncorrelated at the scale of the study, and differed in the apportionment of variance among small (within sites) and large (between sites) spatial scales. While most variance in the emergence-influencing, texture-related gradient occurred at the between-site scale, a considerably greater fraction of variance in the survival-influencing, fertility-related gradient occurred at the within- site scale. It is suggested that, because of fine scale variability in soil fertility, local adaptations of L. latifolia to soil textural properties enhancing seedling emergence will be easier to evolve than adaptations to fertility-related features enhancing seedling survival.

In addition, yield of buckwheat tends to be unstable. Low potential of and unstableness of buckwheat yield can be partially attributed to its nature as an allogamous crop with heterostyly in which insect pollination is indispensable. Fertilization and seed set of buckwheat {{are influenced by the}} number and species of pollinator (Matano et al. 1982, Namai 1982). However, not many reports are found on species or behavior of pollinators of buckwheat (Naumkin 1992, Ren et al., 1986).

40|$|The Bachelor's thesis {{deals with}} changes in {{technology}} of planting sugar beet. In the Czech Republic, sugar beet is {{the most widely used}} raw material for sugar production since the mid- 19 th century. The sugar beet production and production of sugar {{are one of the most}} important segments of agro-food complex, but nowadays sugar beet is also strategic crop of which feed and fertilizers are being made. It is also a source of renewable energy in the form of anhydrous ethyl alcohol and stillage to be processed in biogas plants. Sugar produced in the Czech Republic has a similar quality to the best producers in the EU. In the last two years, Czech growers achieved yields of about 80 t. ha- 1. The yield is constantly increasing, annually by an average of more than two tons. Ploughing has always been a priority during the processing of sugar beet. In the course of time, is rather recomended on heavy soils to use ploughless technology. Nowadays genetically monogerm seed varieties are being used for sowing. The seeds are <b>sown</b> for finite <b>distances</b> by precision seeders. Harvesting is carried out by self-propelled sugar beet harvesters with high-capacity containers.

40|$|Introduction: Accumulation {{of heavy}} metals in agronomic soils {{continuously}} by contaminated waste waters not only causes to contamination of soils but also it affects food quality and security. Cadmium and lead {{are one of}} the most important heavy metals due to long permanence and persistence in soil can cause problems to human and animal health. Some medicinal plants are able to accumulate of heavy metals from contaminated soils. Heavy metals are not able to enter in the essential oil of some aromatic plants. Study of these plants helps human to select them for cultivating the resistant medicinal plants in contaminated soils. Materials and Methods: This experiment was carried out in the research greenhouse of agriculture faculty of Ferdowsi university of Mashhad in 2011. Seeds were cultivated in planting aprons into peat moss medium. Then the uniform plantlets were transferred into soil in the plastic boxes (30 × 50 × 35 cm) at two leaf stage. In each box 6 plantlets were <b>sown</b> with <b>distance</b> of 15 cm on the planting rows and 20 cm between rows. Experiment was set up as factorial on the basis of randomized complete block design with three replications. The first factor was cadmium concentrations consisted of 0, 10, 20, 40 mg per kilogram and the second factor was lead concentrations consisted of 0, 100, 300 and 600 mg/kg. Plants were irrigated during of 15 weeks with cadmium and lead nitrogen nitrate solutions and then irrigated with distilled water. The differences of nitrogen amounts in treatments were compensated with ammonium nitrate on the basis of differences between level of the highest treatment and the treatment which obtained lower amount of nitrogen. Plants were harvested after 180 days at the beginning of flowering. All shoots and roots were weighted separately as fresh weight and then were dried under shading and then were weighted. The essential oil sage was determined by using of 30 grams of dried sage leaves with distillation method with Clevenger. Cadmium and lead contents in shoot and root were measured by wet digestion method (digestion by Perchloric and Nitric acid). Cadmium and lead contents were detected by atomic absorption apparartus.

MSW was collected from secondary waste collection points of municipal corporation, Varanasi district. The vermicomposting of organic fraction of MSW (including vegetable wastes, fruit wastes, flower wastes, paper wastes, and leaf litter) was performed using Eisenia fetida (an earthworm spp.). Three replicates of six different amendments i.e., control (unamended soil), 20 % MSWVC (w/w), 40 % MSWVC (w/w), 60 % MSWVC (w/w), 80 % MSWVC (w/w), and 100 % MSWVC (w/w) designated as S, A, B, C, D, and E respectively were used. The MSWVC was mixed uniformly with soil and left for 10  days in the field before filling the pots. Lady’s finger (Abelmoschus esculentus L. var.

40|$|Published online: 10 August 2017 BACKGROUND Intercropping {{can help}} reduce insect pest populations. However, the results of {{intercropping}} can be pest- and crop-species specific, with varying effects on crop yield, and pest suppression success. In Cameroon, okra vegetable is often grown in intercropped fields and <b>sown</b> with large <b>distances</b> between planting rows (∼ 2 [*]m). Dominant okra pests include cotton aphids, leaf beetles and whiteflies. In a field experiment, we intercropped okra with maize and bean in different combinations (okra monoculture, okra–bean, okra–maize and okra–bean–maize) and altered plant densities (high and low) to test {{for the effects of}} diversity, crop identity and planting distances on okra pests, their predators and yield. RESULTS We found crop identity and plant density, but not crop diversity to influence okra pests, their predators and okra yield. Only leaf beetles decreased okra yield and their abundance reduced at high plant density. Overall, okra grown with bean at high density was the most economically profitable combination. CONCLUSIONS We suggest that when okra is grown at higher densities, legumes (e. g. beans) should be included as an additional crop. Intercropping with a leguminous crop can enhance nitrogen in the soil, benefiting other crops, while also being harvested and sold at market for additional profit. Manipulating planting distances and selecting plants based on their beneficial traits may thus help to eliminate yield gaps in sustainable agriculture.

40|$|Crop {{management}} decisions such as <b>sowing</b> density, row <b>distance</b> and orientation, choice of cultivar, and weed control define {{the architecture of}} the canopy, which in turn affects the light environment experienced by crop plants. Phytochromes, cryptochromes, phototropins, and the UV-B photoreceptor UVR 8 are sensory photoreceptors able to perceive specific light signals that provide information about the dynamic status of canopy architecture. These signals include the low irradiance (indicating that not all the effects of irradiance occur via photosynthesis) and low red/far-red ratio typical of dense stands. The simulation of selected signals of canopy shade light and/or the analysis of photoreceptor mutants have revealed that canopy light signals exert significant influence on plant performance. The main effects of the photoreceptors include the control of (a) the number and position of the leaves and their consequent capacity to intercept light, via changes in stem height, leaf orientation, and branching; (b) the photosynthetic capacity of green tissues, via stomatic and nonstomatic actions; (c) the investment of captured resources into harvestable organs; and (d) the plant defences against herbivores and pathogens. Several of the effects of canopy shade-light signals appear to be negative for yield and pose the question of whether breeding and selection have optimised the magnitude of these responses in crops.

It could be observed that the establishment dynamics of the species from this genus showed differences among the accessions; likewise, it was noticed that all of them fulfilled the selection criteria, although not at the same time. It is concluded that there are intraspecific and interspecific differences in the evaluated material. The most outstanding accessions were L. leucocephala cv. Cunningham, cv. Peru, CIAT- 9119, CIAT- 9438, CIAT- 751, CIAT- 7988, CIAT- 7384, CIAT- 7929, CIAT- 17480, cv. Ipil-pil, cv. CNIA- 250, L. lanceolata CIAT- 17255, CIAT- 17501 and L. diversifolia CIAT- 17270, for which their utilization in further studies is recommended...|$|R
40|$|The {{researches}} of this master thesis {{are directed}} towards {{the influence of}} the time of sowing and the number of plants per unit area on the yield of grain at the soya. The subject of the research is the breed “Pela” with short vegetation which belongs in the 00 / 0 ripening group with vegetation length of 90 to 100 days. The examinations are performed by setting up field tests and conducting laboratory analysis. Since soya is researched as second crop, in conditions of irrigation, the sowing was carried out {{in the second half of}} June 2010 th and 2011 th year. The test was set up on the areas of the University “Goce Delchev” – Shtip, test centre in village Amizbegovo, during period of two years, and those were 2010 th and 2011 th year. The test was done in three repetitions with five variations in each repetition and with different number of plants per unit area achieved with <b>sowing</b> of different <b>distances</b> between the lines of: 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 cm. The work thesis of this research is that one of the more important assumptions for high yield, particularly at sowing of second crops, is the optimal number of plants per unit area. The problems that occur with the enlarged number of plants are perceived in the lengthening of the stem; rising of the first floor of the pod; lying down; a suitable microclimate for development of diseases and pests and in the end a more difficult harvest. If, by any reasons, there is insufficient number of plants per unit area – sparse structure, then at the very beginning we are losing the potential for high economically justified yield, the plants form larger number of branches, the first floor of the pods is set very low to the surface of the soil, the possibility for greater growth of weed is higher and all these factors together contribute for large losses of grain at the harvest and for presence of admixtures of weed in the harvested material. In order to avoid all these consequences it is necessary to determine the optimal density of the structure for genotype suitable for cultivation as a second crop. The number of plants per unit area is the most significant component of the yield and if it is not optimal all the additional interventions towards increase of the yield remain unsuccessful. The way of sowing and the size of the vegetative space (structure of plants per unit considerably influence the yield of the soya. The number and the layout of the plants influence the growth, the development and the productivity of the soya. It would be a proper way, when for each production area, for each breed or group of ripeness the most suitable structure is examined and determined, because the breed can achieve its genetic potential of fertility only in an optimal vegetative space...|$|R
40|$|Trials {{have been}} {{conducted}} in the Philippines {{to find ways of}} improving crop yields through the use of organic fertilizers. The following are reports {{based on the results of}} three of the experiments. Rapid composting and the use of compost as fertilizer Researchers in the Philippines tested, in rice fields, composts generated from Trichoderma. They found that the treatment increased yields of rice, and reduced the need for chemical fertilizers. Crop residues were thoroughly wetted, any woody parts were chopped and everything was piled loosely into a compost pen or raised platform. One or two handfuls of activator were broadcast on each 10 - 15 cm thick layer of rice straw, animal manure and Leucaena leucocephala. The compost pile was then covered with plastic sacks, banana or coconut leaves. The pile was moistened periodically and turned at least once, particularly when there were woody substrates. After 3 - 5 weeks the compost was already ripe, with a low temperature in an layers the substrates were brown to black and soily. A half-rate dose of inorganic fertilizer was applied as a side-dressing. At the end of the trial year, yield increases were up to 16 %. Using Azospirillum for maize production Azospirillum bacteria isolated from the roots of talahib grass can supplement the nitrogen fertilizer requirement of maize. Before planting, maize seeds were inoculated with Azospirillum and then <b>sown</b> at a <b>distance</b> of 25 m between hills in ground that had been ploughed, harrowed and had basal fertilizer applied to it. The plants were then hand-weeded, thinned, sprayed with pesticide and side-dressed with fertilizer. Azospirillum-inoculated maize plants were found consistently to grow taller and greener compared to uninoculated plants. yields were also higher than uninoculated plants and responded favourably to different fertilizer levels. Inoculated maize fertilized with 30 - 0 - 0 NPK gave the highest return on investment (142 %). Response of maize to the inoculant was affected by the inoculant concentration, type and fertility of the soil and the season. The inoculant was effective if roots were colonized with 100, 000 to 1, 000, 000 cells of Azospirillum per plant but was less effective in clayey soils or soils with a high organic matter content. Soil subjected to either very low or very high fertilization rates also caused the inoculant to be less effective. Sesbania rostrata as a source of fertilizer for maize Research has shown that sowing Sesbania rostrata at a seeding rate of 45 kg/ha can supplement 75 % of the nitrogen requirement of maize after the third cropping. S. rostrata seeds were first soaked in concentrated sulphuric acid for 20 minutes then drilled at 45 kg/ha into furrows 50 cm apart. As soon as the Sesbania started to flower it was ploughed under. Maize was then planted in furrows 75 cm apart with one seed per hill at 25 cm intervals. After 25 - 30 days a side-dressing of 25 % total N (urea) was applied. Results showed that green manuring with S. rostrata increased organic matter content and nitrogen mobilization of phosphorus, improved rnicrobiological and physical properties of the soil and had the potential to accumulate nitrogen and substitute for it as a fertilizer as well as to increase yield.
