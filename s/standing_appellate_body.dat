In sharp contrast with other systems, the report is required to be adopted at a meeting of the DSB within 60 days of its circulation, unless the DSB by consensus decides not to adopt the report or a party to the dispute gives notice of its intention to appeal. A party may appeal a panel report to the <b>standing</b> <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body,</b> but only on issues of law and legal interpretations developed by the panel. Each appeal is heard by three members of the permanent seven-member Appellate Body set up by the Dispute Settlement Body and broadly representing the range of WTO membership. Members of the Appellate Body have four-year terms. They must be individuals with recognized standing in the field of law and international trade, not affiliated with any government. The Appellate Body may uphold, modify or reverse the panel's legal findings and conclusions. Normally appeals should not last more than 60 days, with an absolute maximum of 90 days. The possibility for appeal makes the WTO dispute resolution system unique among the judicial processes of dispute settlement in general public international law.|$|E

Its highly developed dispute settlement system, {{which is one of}} the few in international law to include a <b>standing</b> <b>appellate</b> <b>body,</b> invites comparisons to the institution of judicial review in the United States under the paradigm of Marbury v. Madison. Such a comparison yields insights about both the WTO dispute settlement system and Marbury-style judicial review. This article first notes an important parallel between the two systems: like the WTO, judicial review in the United States began as the refinement of a flawed treaty-based system. After describing how the two institutions developed from flawed treaty regimes, this article examines some important structural differences between how the two institutions exercise “judicial review, 2 ̆ 2 as well as one feature of the WTO that is sometimes thought to distinguish it from other legal regimes, but in fact does not.

40|$|The {{founding}} of the World Trade Organization in 1995, was hailed as {{a new era in}} resolving global trade disputes, with many academicians espousing a constitutionalised vision of world trade law. The constitutional evolution of WTO law is founded, not only on the text of the WTO Covered Agreements, but is also buttressed exceedingly by precedence and norms that are generated through adjudication by the panels and the <b>standing</b> WTO <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body.</b> Today, as is with most mature legal systems, international lawyers and academics avidly critique WTO jurisprudence and the interpretive methodology of its adjudicators. However, there is a dearth of scholarship on the implications of WTO law interpretation on developing nations. This thesis fills this void in research by constructing a framework for analysing the jurisprudence of the WTO from the perspective of developing nations. Subsequently, it proceeds to evaluate three agreements which are important for developing nations, i. e., the DSU and due process rights, the TRIPS Agreement, and the Antidumping Agreement. To this end, the framework for analysis is termed "the development approach" to fair adjudication, which is grounded on established legal concepts of legitimacy, justice and ultimately fairness. The thesis demonstrates that a fair trading regime entails more than seemingly balanced treaty texts, but rather that adjudication of the treaties must include an approach, which recognises and accounts for the effects of interpretation on development. To this end, the adjudicators have to go beyond merely finding the literal meaning of the treaty text, but embrace an approach, which is guided by the context and purpose of WTO provisions. The analysis reveals that the adjudicators of the WTO have failed to recognise the nexus between interpretation and development and as such, have created a body of case law that harms the development ambitions of third world countries...|$|R

40|$|This article {{analyses}} how the <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body</b> {{in practice}} expresses its {{interpretation of the}} WTO covered agreements, and discusses whether the <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body's</b> hermeneutics {{is different from that}} of other international courts and tribunals. It shows {{that it is impossible to}} discern the <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body's</b> hermeneutics from the practical exposition of how it interprets treaties. It also addresses the alleged particularity of the <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body's</b> hermeneutics. The key thread is the function of treaty interpretation in the development of the judicial function in the WTO. From the outset, the <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body</b> made the conscious choice to function as if it were a court. This exercise of the judicial function relates to the tasks and powers of the international judge and transcends the mere mandate and context of a particular court or tribunal as established in its constitutive document and other procedural rules. The <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body's</b> use of principles of interpretation has been instrumental in making acceptable its early choice to function as a court and to build its judicial identity. After 15 years of jurisprudence, the response of WTO members and the broader audience for the <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body's</b> decisions shows general acceptance of this initial, but perhaps not unavoidable, choice and the strategy to achieve this objective. In turn, this response has prompted less formalism in the <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body's</b> recent interpretations of the WTO treaties. © EJIL 2010; all rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body</b> of the World Trade Organization and its rise to {{prominence}} in the world trading system. The <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body</b> was not conceived by the Uruguay Round negotiators {{as the centerpiece of}} the WTO dispute settlement system. It was more an afterthought, linked to the introduction of the quasi-automatic adoption of panel reports under the new dispute settlement system. In little time, however, the <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body</b> grew into the most important and authoritative organ of WTO dispute settlement. The <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body</b> is now, in all but name, the World Trade Court. The significance of its contribution to the development of international trade law is generally recognized. Critics even accused the <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body</b> of having engaged in judicial legislation. This paper does not seek to assess whether the <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body</b> did indeed exceed its judicial mandate. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to recall the unassuming origins of the <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body</b> and to discuss the factors that have contributed to its rise to prominence over the last decade. These factors are multiple and often closely related. They include the first and subsequent compositions of the Appellate Body; the Working Procedures for Appellate Review; the early embracement and consistent application of the rules of interpretation of the Vienna Convention; the frequent and broad recourse to appellate review; the manner in which the <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body</b> used its authority of appellate review; and, finally, the case law of the <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body</b> to date, and in particular the case law balancing free trade and other societal values and the case law ensuring the fairness and effectiveness of the WTO dispute settlement system. It is important to identify and correctly appreciate these factors because the <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body</b> will retain its current status and role in the world trading system only to the extent that these factors continue to be sufficiently present. ...|$|R

40|$|Two of {{the four}} issues in this <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body</b> Report {{concerned}} the proper scope of Article 21. 5 DSU compliance panel proceedings; the other two issues concerned the <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body's</b> review of the Panel's use of evidence. On the Article 21. 5 issues, the <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body</b> essentially ruled that an Article 21. 5 compliance proceeding could evaluate the WTO consistency of: (i) the entirety of an implementation measure (including parts of the measure that did not specifically implement DSB recommendations and rulings) and (ii) new subsidy grants made under a program in respect of which prior subsidy grants had been found to cause serious prejudice so as {{to determine whether the}} new grants also resulted in serious prejudice. On the evidentiary issues, the <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body</b> upheld the Panel's conclusions, although it modified certain of the Panel's reasoning. Probably the most interesting aspect of the case was the substantial deference showed by the <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body</b> to the Panel's consideration of causation and non-attribution issues. This deference was striking compared to the lack of deference that the <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body</b> has given to national authorities on those issues.

Unfortunately, the <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body</b> failed to reveal the substantive obligation imposed on these charges under Article II: 1 (b).

40|$|This {{essay is}} about the {{application}} of procedural approaches in the US-Zeroing case that serve to highlight potential problems with <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body</b> decision-making. Those problems go to central issues of judicial restraint, including concerns surrounding standards of review, appellate fact-finding, and notions of justiciability and ripeness. This essay will begin with an analysis of US-Zeroing 2 ̆ 7 s approach in applying the specialized standard of review under the Antidumping Agreement, arguing that it fails {{to adhere to the}} obligation of deference to permissible Member State interpretations of WTO antidumping obligations. It then examines the fact-finding procedures applied by the <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body,</b> which raise troubling concerns about the <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body</b> 2 ̆ 7 s failure to confer deference to the reasonable factual findings of Member States and WTO panels.
