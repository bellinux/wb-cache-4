5|$|Fukuda's {{training}} method consisted mostly {{of the student}} taking fall after fall for the teacher or senior student until he began to understand {{the mechanics of the}} technique. Fukuda stressed applied technique over ritual form. He gave beginners a <b>short</b> <b>description</b> of the technique and had them engage in free practice (randori) in order to teach through experience. It was only after the student had attained some proficiency that he taught them traditional forms (kata). This method was difficult, as there were no special mats for falling, only the standard straw mats (tatami) laid over wooden floors.|$|E

It is also possible to search the holdings of Malta's National Memory Project, a memory of those who have contributed to the history of Malta, through the Archives' web site.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} R. R. Darlington {{argued that}} the Vita was written right after Æthelwig's death, but another historian, David Knowles, wrote that it probably was written about 1110, possibly by the prior of Evesham, Dominic. Antonia Gransden, another historian, agrees with Darlington, and finds it {{more likely to have}} been written shortly after Æthelwig's death. The work itself is not a hagiography, in that it doesn't attribute any miracles to Æthelwig, and instead is a mix of charters and narratives. Nor does it give any details on Æthelwig's early life or his selection as abbot. A large portion of the work is a detailed list of lands acquired by Æthelwig for the abbey, and concludes with a <b>short</b> <b>description</b> of the abbott's death.|$|E

In 2007, Roody and Both published a <b>short</b> <b>description</b> and color photograph of the species in their field guide Mushrooms of the Southeastern United States, {{but this was not}} a valid name as it lacked a Latin description.

5|$|Henry and his {{crusade to}} Finland {{were also a}} part of the legend of King Eric. The {{appendix}} of the early 13th century Västgötalagen, which has a <b>short</b> <b>description</b> of Eric's memorable deeds, also makes no reference to Henry or the crusade. Henry and the crusade are both fully present only in a version of Eric's legend that dates to 1344. Similarities in the factual content and phraseology regarding the common events indicate that either one of the legends has acted as the model for the other. Henry's legend is commonly considered to have been written during the 1280s or 1290s at the latest, for the consecration of the Cathedral of Turku in 1300, when his alleged remains were translated there from Nousiainen, a parish not far from Turku. Yet, even as late as in the 1470s, the crusade legend was ignored in the Chronica regni Gothorum, a chronicle of the history of Sweden, written by Ericus Olai, the Canon of the Uppsala cathedral.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} {{described}} as new to science by American mycologists Rolf Singer and Alexander H. Smith, based on specimens collected in Nor Yungas Province, Bolivia, {{on the road to}} La Paz to Coroico. They published a <b>short</b> <b>description</b> in Latin in a 1958 Mycologia publication, followed by a more detailed description in English later that year. According to Psilocybe specialist Gastón Guzmán, the species Psilocybe acutissima (described by Roger Heim in 1958), and Psilocybe isauri (described by Singer in 1959) are synonyms, as both the macroscopic and microscopic features are the same in the type material of all three. Singer considered P.isauri a species distinct from P.yungensis because of differences in the hairiness of the stem surface. Smith named the variety P.yungensis var. diconica for specimens he found with conical, rather than obconical (the form of an inverted cone) papilla. Similarly, the main distinguishing feature that Heim ascribed to P.acutissima was a papillate cap (somewhat resembling the shape of a female human breast). Later studies showed that these morphological variations did not warrant individual recognition, because of the variable nature of these characteristics, and the existence of intermediate forms.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the United States, Georgia geology has been included in maps produced for the entire country. The first geological map of the U.S. was produced in 1809 by William Maclure. In 1807, Maclure undertook the self-imposed task of making a geological survey of the United States. He traversed and mapped nearly every state in the Union. During the rigorous two-year period of his survey, he crossed and recrossed the Allegheny Mountains some 50 times. The results of his unaided endeavor were submitted to the American Philosophical Society in a memoir entitled Observations on the Geology of the United States explanatory of a Geological Map, together with the nation's first geological map, which were published in the Society's journal Transactions, This precedes William Smith's geological map of England by six years, although Smith's map was constructed using a different classification of rocks. Several reports used Maclure’s geological map to accompany their description of the geology of the U.S. (Beaujour, 1814 and Marcou, 1858). In 1816, within an elementary treatise of mineralogy and geology, Parker Cleaveland produced a geological map of the U.S. In 1843, Charles Moxon produced a small-scale geologic map of the U.S., where Ami Boué produced a geological structure map of the globe. In 1853, Marcou produced a geological map of the U.S. and the British provinces of North America. In 1856, Henry Darwin Rogers created a similar map of the geology of the U.S. and British North America. There was a <b>short</b> <b>description</b> of the geologic map of the U.S. by Charles Henry Hitchcock in 1872, which had small-scale geological maps included. Hitchcock and William P. Blake published a general geologic map of the U.S. in R.W. Raymond’s Statistics of mines and mining. In 1874, they published a geological map of the U.S. and territories in the U.S. Census 9th Statistical Atlas. Hitchcock and Blake published a summary of this map in the Geological Magazine in 1873. Gray’s geological map of the U.S. was published in the National Atlas special edition at a scale of about 1inch to 300 miles in 1876 and reprinted in 1886 by the American Institute of Mining Engineers. A geological map of the U.S. east of the Rocky Mountains was produced at the scale of 1inch to 105.5 miles by Frank H. Bradley. In the 1880s several geological maps of the U.S. were produced. William John McGee offered a detailed description for the U.S. Geological Survey in 1884. In 1887, Hitchcock produced a geological map of the U.S. and parts of Canada that was at the scale of 1inch to 200 miles, with a review of the various maps of the U.S. that accompanied the geological map of the U.S. In 1895, McGee and J.B. Tolbert produced a 1:15,000,000 scale map of the geology of the U.S.|$|E

40|$|Cross-lingual data linking is {{the problem}} of {{establishing}} links between resources, such as places, services, or movies, which are described in different languages. In cross-lingual data linking it is often the case that very <b>short</b> <b>descriptions</b> have to be matched, which makes the problem even more challenging. This work presents a method named TRanslation-based Explicit Semantic Analysis (TR-ESA) to represent and match <b>short</b> textual <b>descriptions</b> available in different languages. TR-ESA translates <b>short</b> <b>descriptions</b> in any given language into a pivot language by exploiting a machine translation tool.

The resulting representations are used to match <b>short</b> <b>descriptions</b> in different languages. The method is incorporated in CroSeR (Cross-lingual Service Retrieval), an interactive data linking tool that recommends potential matches to users. We compared results coming from an in-vitro evaluation on a gold standard consisting of five datasets in different languages, with an in-vivo experiment that involved human experts supported by CroSeR.
