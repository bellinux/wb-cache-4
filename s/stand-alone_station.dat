5000|$|On March 23, 1972, Frank K. Spain bought WHTV {{and made}} it a {{full-time}} satellite of WTWV (now WTVA) in Tupelo which was affiliated with NBC with some ABC programs such as college football carried at other times. [...] Television guides during this time instructed viewers to consult WTWV's listings for WHTV's program schedule. This changed in 1980 when Spain opted to convert WHTV into a <b>stand-alone</b> <b>station,</b> making it the primary CBS affiliate for Meridian after WTOK changed its affiliation to ABC; NBC, then the lowest-rated network, was not seen for about two years by residents of the area, except those who could receive, either over-the-air or by cable, either Jackson's WLBT or Hattiesburg's WDAM. In 1982, NBC returned to the market on WLBM (now WGBC) as a semi-satellite of WLBT. Meanwhile, in 1986, WHTV changed call letters to WTZH.|$|E
50|$|The {{station was}} {{launched}} in 1957 by Cariboo Broadcasters on 570 AM. The Williams Lake transmitter was added in 1960, and a 100 Mile House transmitter was added in 1971. The Quesnel transmitter moved to 920 AM in 1980, and the AM 570 allocation was moved to CKWL in Williams Lake where it remains today. CKCQ migrated to its current FM frequency in 2004 and the AM 920 transmitter fell silent. The 100 Mile station, CKBX was converted to a <b>stand-alone</b> <b>station</b> serving 100 Mile and area exclusively in 2008.

50|$|By 1994, KOME had flipped {{to modern}} rock and KSJO was the <b>stand-alone</b> AOR <b>station</b> in Santa Clara Valley. Also, {{many of the}} San Francisco rock {{stations}} had long changed to different formats as well. KSJO rode a wave of popularity during the decade due primarily to the appeal of morning personalities Lamont and Tonelli. By 1998, KSJO's signal was simulcast on three other separate stations (located near 92.3 on the dial) around the San Francisco Bay Area: 92.7 KXJO in Alameda/Oakland, 92.7 KMJO in Marina and 92.1 KFJO in Walnut Creek.|$|R
5000|$|In the mid-1960s, WTWV was {{approached}} by ABC about becoming a full affiliate of that network. Spain, who was still receiving [...] "bootleg" [...] NBC programming, told NBC executives about ABC's offer to pay him the customary rates. This prompted NBC to finally negotiate a formal deal with Spain, which made WTWV an official NBC affiliate, {{one of only three}} in Mississippi at the time. It still carried some ABC programming in off-hours (namely, college football on Saturdays) until WVSB (now WLOV) in nearby West Point began operating in 1983. Starting in 1972, WTWV operated a full-time satellite for eastern central Mississippi, WHTV (now WMDN) in Meridian on channel 24; WHTV operated as such until 1980, when Spain decided to make it a <b>stand-alone</b> <b>station,</b> with a CBS affiliation. WTWV built a new tower in the 1970s that not only brought a city-grade signal to Columbus for the first time, but gave the station one of the largest coverage areas in the country.|$|E
50|$|This {{radio station}} is {{famous in the}} {{broadcast}} radio industry, due to Gerry Turro (former chief engineer of WNEW, New York), who thought that he {{figured out how to}} legally operate an FM translator, commercially, in the #1 Market in the world, New York City. Unfortunately jealous nearby competition did not think it was legal. Miriam Warshaw and her husband Howard, owners of AM <b>stand-alone</b> <b>station</b> 1160 WVNJ filed a lawsuit in federal court claiming that Jukebox Radio's signal was illegal because the low power station was run as the main station while the full power station was a translator. Also since the signals had little if any overlap. WJUX 99.7 Monticello was receiving the signal from the Jukebox Radio studios through phone lines. The suit also claimed that 99.7 was designated to serve the Northwestern Hudson Valley and the southern Catskills and not Bergen County, but all its programming aimed at Bergen County and most of its advertisers were based out of Bergen County. WVNJ had an R & B Oldies format at the time WJUX went commercial in 1995, but switched to Adult Standards early in 1996 due to low ratings. Also, WJUX had an advantage being on FM, taking potential advertisers away from WVNJ. WVNJ thought that if they could get Jukebox off the air, they would have all the advertisers to themselves, they were wrong.|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 30 -November 02, 1989 / Town & Country Hotel & Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaThis paper {{describes}} an integrated architecture providing {{in a single}} box the complete functions of a telemetry system.

40|$|After {{moderate}} to strong earthquakes in Italy {{or in the}} surrounding areas, the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV; National Institute for Geophysics and Volcanology) activates a temporary seismic network infrastructure. This is devoted to integration with the Italian National Seismic Network (RSN) [Delladio 2011] in the epicentral area, thus improving the localization of the aftershocks distribution after a mainshock. This infrastructure is composed of a stand-alone, locally recording part (Re. Mo.) [Moretti et al. 2010] and a real-time telemetered part (Re. Mo. Tel.) [Abruzzese et al. 2011 a, 2011 b] that can stream data to the acquisition centers in Rome and Grottaminarda. After the May 20, 2012, Ml 5. 9 earthquake in the Emilia region (northern Italy), the temporary network was deployed in the epicentral area; in particular, 10 telemetered and 12 <b>stand-alone</b> <b>stations</b> were installed [Moretti et al. 2012, this volume]. Using the dedicated connection between the acquisition center in Rome and the Ancona acquisition sub-center [Cattaneo et al. 2011], the signals of the real-time telemetered stations were acquired also in this sub-center.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{proposal}} is to join together {{the owners of the}} most advanced CPV technology, with respect to the state of the art, in order to research from its leading position new applications for CPV systems. In addition to opening up new markets, it will unveil possible sources of failure in new environments outside Europe, in order to assure component reliability. The proposed project will also try to improve the current technology of the industrial partners (ISOFOTON and CONCENTRIX) by accelerating the learning curve that CPV must follow in order to reach the competitive market, and lowering the cost under the current flat panel PV significantly within 3 - 4 years. The use of CPV systems in remote areas, together with harsher radiation, ambient and infrastructure conditions will help to increase the rate of progress of this technology. In addition, the ISFOC s contribution, which brings together seven power plants from seven CPV technologies up to 3 MWpeak, will allow creating the most complete database of components and systems performance to be generated as well as the effects of radiation and meteorology on systems operations. Finally, regarding the new applications for CPV subject, the project will use a CPV system sized 25 kWp in a <b>stand-alone</b> <b>station</b> in Egypt (NWRC) for the first time for water pumping and irrigation purposes. In a similar way ISOFOTON will connect up to 25 kWp CPV to the Moroccan ONE utility grid. From the research content point of view of this project, which is directly addressed by the scope of the call, the cooperative research between UPM, FhG-ISE and the two companies will be favoured by the fact that all are progressing in similar directions: developing two-stage optics CPV systems. In addition to these technology improvements the UPM is very interested in developing a new concept of module, recently patented, which will fulfil all required characteristics of a good CPV with less components and reducing cost...|$|E
