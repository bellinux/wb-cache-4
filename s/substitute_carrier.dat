40|$|Amino acid:[carrier protein] ligases (aa:CP ligases) are newly {{discovered}} homologs of aminoacyl- tRNA synthetases (aaRS) which aminoacylate carrier proteins instead of tRNA. Activated amino acids {{are attached to}} prosthetic group of carrier proteins by thioester bond. Weak thioacylation activity was observed for many conventional aaRS. Therefore, different thiols were investigated as substrate analogs for aa:CP ligases. Here we show that coenzyme A, dithiothreitol and cysteine are efficiently aminoacylated by aa:CP ligases. The crystal structure of aa:CP ligase from Bradyrhizobium japonicum in complex with coenzyme A was solved, and revealed that CoA, besides acting as the substrate analog of the carrier protein, also competes with ATP for binding to the active site. aa:CP ligases do not aminoacylate tRNA, although they remarkably resemble catalytic core of atypical seryl-tRNA synthetases (aSerRS) from methanogenic archaea. Since aa:CP ligases lack tRNA-binding domain, fusion proteins of aa:CP ligases and aSerRS tRNA-binding domain were prepared in attempt to restore tRNA aminoacylation activity. Although fusion proteins were able to bind tRNA through appended domain, tRNA could not <b>substitute</b> <b>carrier</b> proteins in aminoacylation reaction. (doi: 10. 5562 /cca 1818...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{limiting}} factor to corneal transplantation is {{the availability of}} donors. Research has suggested that xenogenic acellular corneal scaffolds (XACS) may be a possible alternative to transplantation. This study aimed to investigate the viability of performing lamellar corneal transplantation (LCT) in rabbits using canine XACS. Methods: Fresh dog corneas were decellularized by serial digestion, and LCT was performed on rabbit eyes using xenogeneic decellularized corneal matrix. Cellular and morphological changes were observed by slit-lamp, light, and scanning electron microscopy at 7, 30 and 90 days postoperatively. Immunocytochemical staining for specific markers such as keratin 3, vimentin and MUC 5 AC, was used to identify cells in the graft. Results: Decellularized xenogenic corneal matrix remained transparent for about 1 -month after LCT. The recipient cells were able to survive and proliferate into the grafts. Three months after transplantation, grafts had merged with host tissue, and graft epithelialization and vascularization had occurred. Corneal nerve fibers were able to grow into the graft in rabbits transplanted with XACS. Conclusions: Xenogenic acellular corneal scaffolds can maintain the transparency of corneal grafts about 1 -month and permit growth of cells and nerve fibers, and is, therefore, a potential <b>substitute</b> or <b>carrier</b> for a replacement cornea...|$|R

40|$|The {{search for}} a {{clinically}} useful blood substitute has been stimulated by the inherent limitations of the homologous blood transfusion system, particularly its sufficiency, safety and costs. Blood {{has been described as}} the "most complicated fluid in animals" (Winslow, 1992). An attempt to forulUlate a blood substitute is misguided because blood is composed of a complex mixture of fluids, cells, salts, proteins and numerous other molecules having various functions and characteristics. The hemorrhage or loss of blood foremost results in a hypovolemic state and ultimately leads to depletion of oxygen delivering capability (Dracker, 1995). Biologically significant hemorrhage may be defined as a blood loss sufficient to impair oxygen transport (Shoemaker et al., 1973; Bassin et al., 1971; Hauser and Shoemaker, 1982). The major physiological effect of hemorrhage is anemia and hypovolemia leading to drastic aIterations in blood flow to the vital organ systems (Prough et al., 1991). The persistent hypoperfusion to organ systems is responsible for ultimate organ failure even after reperfusion (Knaus et al., 1985). The infusion of large volume of Ringer's lactate in the resuscitation of hemorrhaged patients is associated with several disadvantages. In addition, problems associated with blood transfusion necessitate the development of an alternative resuscitative solution which can be administered in small volumes and is effective in combating the comprom. ised hemodynamics. Haemoglobin-based blood <b>substitutes</b> (oxygen <b>carriers)</b> have been proposed to be effective in the treatment of hemorrhagic shock.

Oxygen is transported by convection in the vascular compartments and by diffusion in the surrounding tissue where it is utilized. Intravascular resistance and the diffusive loss of oxygen from the arterioles to the tissue are incorporated in the model. The model predicts that most of the O 2 transport occurs at the level of capillaries. Results computed from the present model {{in the presence of}} hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers are consistent with those obtained from the earlier validated model (Sharan et al., 1989, 1998 a) on oxygen transport in brain circulation in the absence of extracellular hemoglobin.

40|$|The journal is {{available}} at [URL] electrophoresis of the white flocculent pheromone disseminating secretions produced by males of the three dung beetle species, Kheper lumarcki, K. nigroacneus and K. subaeneus, revealed that three different proteins with molecular masses of ca. 15 kDa are the major constituents of these secretions. The molecular mass of these components in the secretions of K. lamarcki and K. nigroaeneus was determined more accurately by 252 Cf plasma desorption mass spectrometry to be 15451 ± 10 and 15477 ± 10 Da respectively. The N-terminal amino acids in the major proteinaceous component of the secretions revealed similarities as well as differences in the primary structures of the proteins secreted by the three species. The amino acid composition of the secretions of the three species is closely related. Due {{to the presence of}} large amounts of aspartic and glutamic acid, and small amounts of the basic amino acids, the proteinaceous component of the carrier material is expected to have a low isoelectric point which, together with the presence of large amounts of the hydrophobic amino acids, may impart properties that are to be expected for a carrier material which is used for the dissemination of inter alia long-chain fatty acids and their esters. Exposure of bovine pancreas trypsin, bovine albumin and the carrier protein of K. lamarcki to the vapour of 2. 6 -dimethyl- 5 -heptenoic acid, the major volatile constituent with electroantennogram activity in the secretion of this species, followed by quantitative determination of the acid adsorbed on these proteins, showed that albumin and the carrier protein have an approximately equal affinity for the acid, whereas trypsin retained only about one third of the amount of the acid adsorbed on the other two proteins. lt was concluded that albumin should be a suitable <b>substitute</b> for the <b>carrier</b> protein in field tests with synthetic constituents of the abdominal secretion of these insects.

40|$|Residues {{from animal}} {{husbandry}} {{are one of}} the major greenhouse gas (GHG) emission sources in agriculture. The production of biogas from agricultural residues can reduce GHG emissions through an improved handling of the material streams such as manure storage. Additionally, biogas can <b>substitute</b> fossil energy <b>carriers</b> in the provision of heat, power, and transport fuels. The aim of this work is to estimate the manure potential for biogas production in Germany under the consideration of the farm size of livestock production. In Germany, cattle and pig farming is of major relevance with more than 130, 000 farms throughout the country. To unlock the biogas potential of manure, the low energy density of manure, depending on the dry matter content, needs to be considered, meaning that biogas installations need to be built close to the manure production on the farm site. This not only results in a high number of biogas plants, but also due to the wide range of farm sizes in Germany, a huge number of very small biogas plants. Small biogas installations have higher specific investment costs. Together with the relatively low methane yields from manure, costs for power generation would be very high. Co-substrates with higher methane yield can lower the costs for biogas. Thus, the use of a co-substrate could help to use small manure potentials. Biogas plants with the necessary minimum size of 50 kWel installed power could be established at farms representing 12 % of all cattle and 16. 5 % of all pigs respectively in Germany. Using excrement from pigs, farms representing 16. 5 % of the total amount of pigs could establish a biogas plant. The use of manure in combination with energy crops can increase the size of biogas plants on a farm site significantly. At cattle farms, the share would increase to 31. 1 % with 40 % co-substrate and to 40. 8 % with 60 % co-substrate. At pig farms, the share would increase to 36 % if co-substrates were used...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{bioenergy}} {{systems have}} significant potential to cost-effectively <b>substitute</b> fossil energy <b>carriers</b> with substantial GHG emissions reduction benefits. To mobilise large-scale biomass supplies, {{large volumes of}} biomass feedstock need to be secured, and competitive feedstock value chains {{need to be developed}} and optimised, based on identification of appropriate combinations of feedstock and conversion technologies. This makes assessments of biomass resource availability a critical part of the biomass value chain. Given the global distribution of biomass production regions and markets as well as the nature of raw biomass, pre-processing biomass {{plays an important role in}} improving biomass supply chain economics. Logistics and transport are key costs components in the biomass value chain and major investments in infrastructure and capacity are required to realise large scale biomass supplies. Establishing this infrastructure is gradual and takes time, which also applies to the mobilisation of large volumes of biomass. These two aspects are interrelated and region specific due to the unique settings for biomass feedstock production and local infrastructure. Given this context, there is need for examining the entire biomass supply value chain so as to understand the many elements involved in bioenergy mobilisation. Thus, the main objective of this thesis was to design sustainable biomass energy supply chains to enable competitive mobilisation of large scale biomass supplies for both the short and long term. With regards to resource assessments, the analysis showed that, under strict sustainability criteria, substantial volumes of biomass exist which could – if efficiently mobilized – contribute significantly to renewable energy production. Currently, it is more cost-effective to ship densified solid biomass, e. g pellets, from low cost biomass production regions of the world for final large scale conversion in the major biofuel markets. Early biomass conversion to secondary energy carriers in the supply chain is only cost effective where infrastructure already exists for low cost transport to the market. Thus in the short term, wood pellets are expected to play an important role as the internationally traded solid biomass commodity. In the near future, torrefied pellets may become the dominant and preferred internationally traded solid biomass commodity as the technology is commercialised. Overall, advanced biofuels are attractive against fossil fuels both economically and also in terms of GHG reductions. At current conditions, advanced biofuels can be delivered from about 12. 5 $/GJfuel and reduce GHG emissions by at least 60 %- the threshold of minimum GHG emission saving set in the EU renewable energy directive for biofuels. However, advanced biofuel technologies are being developed and their successful commercialisation of will depend on overcoming several technical and economic challenges. Increasing operational scale, rapid deployment and technological learning are key to biofuel cost reduction. In addition, a large, stable supply of biomass feedstock needs to be guaranteed. To better understand the biomass resource base and implementation possibilities, more scientific research needs to be conducted in developing countries to improve the quality of biomass resource assessments and investigate implementation business models...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Hydroxyethyl starch (HES) -based volume {{replacement}} {{solutions are}} currently {{the most frequently}} used artificial colloids. Adverse drug reactions of HES are HES-induced coagulopathy that includes disturbed fibrin polymerization and impaired platelet function, as well as an acquired HES-induced von-Willebrand-like syndrome type 1. Changes of HES formulas relating to molecular weight, degree of substitution and concentration could decrease the impairment of coagulation. Modern HES preparations are of middle molecular weight, low substituted, and mainly isooncotic. Older hyperoncotic HES were associated with improved haemodynamics and oxygen transport, but also with higher impairment of coagulation. Introduction of electrolyte-balanced <b>carrier</b> solutions <b>substituting</b> the classic <b>carrier</b> solution of 0. 9 % sodium chloride attenuated the metabolic disturbances; a benefit concerning the coagulopathy is controversially discussed in the literature. The aim of the study presented was a systematic analysis of the in vitro effect on coagulation that is exerted by concentration and carrier solution of modern, middle molecular weight, low substituted HES in an in vitro model of stepwise increasing haemodilution. Besides, the in vitro reproducibility of blood group dependence of HES-induced, acquired von-Willebrand-like syndrome type 1 was investigated. Materials and Methods Both iso- and hyperoncotic, non-balanced and electrolyte-balanced HES solutions of identical molecular weight (MW 130, 000 Da) and comparable degree of substitution (DS 0. 4 or 0. 42, respectively) were investigated in an in vitro model of haemodilution. Citrated blood was obtained from 10 healthy volunteers of blood groups 0 or A, and the effect of 20 %, 40 % and 60 % haemodilution was measured by conventional coagulation parameters, by von-Willebrand-parameters and by dynamic coagulation parameters of activated thromboelastometry. As conventional coagulation parameters a full blood count, measurement of ionized calcium, prothrombin time ratio in percent (“Quick-value”), activated partial prothrombin time (aPTT), factor VIII (FVIII) as well as quantitative and qualitative assessment of von-Willebrand-Factor (vWF) was performed. In thromboelastometry, parameters CT, CFT and MCF of the EXTEM assay, and MCF of the FIBTEM assay were measured. Statistical analysis was performed using non-parametric tests. Results Concerning the effect of the concentration of HES, in this study at some dilutional degrees higher Quick-value and FVIII, and lower aPTT, respectively, were measured after dilution with hyperoncotic HES. No benefit could be demonstrated concerning the von-Willebrand-Factor parameters by hyperoncotic HES formulas. In thromboelastometry a higher impairment of coagulation by hyperoncotic HES was seen. Concerning the effect of the carrier solution, in conventional coagulation parameters significantly higher levels of ionized calcium, less impaired Quick- and aPTT-values as well as higher FVIII levels were found after dilution with electrolyte-balanced HES. Neither could a benefit of electrolyte-balanced HES on the von-Willebrand-Factor parameters be demonstrated, nor could the benefit on thromboelastometry, that had been described in previous studies, be reproduced. With regard to the levels of vWF, the associated FVIII, and the functional activity of vWF, blood group 0 had lower values compared to blood group A, at baseline and during stepwise haemodilution. This is in line with the existing literature. Considering the physiologically lower baseline levels, a higher extent of impairment for blood group 0 by modern HES could not be demonstrated by quantitative assessments, although a higher extent of functional impairment could not be excluded. Discussion and conclusion There is a discrepancy between the observed effects of higher concentrated HES that impaired conventional coagulation parameters to a lesser, but thromboelastometry parameters to a higher degree than isooncotic HES. This discrepancy is in line with previous studies, and can be due to an in vitro measurement artifact by turbidimetric measurements. In case of turbidimetric measurements of coagulation parameters, i. e. optical measurements, colloids like HES can cause falsely-elevated readings, so mechanical measurements may be a favorable alternative. Given the lack of valid in vivo data and considering the higher impairment of coagulation demonstrated by thromboelastometry, high-volume resuscitation using a hyperoncotic HES should be restrictively applied. The discussion on potential benefits of electrolyte-balanced carrier solutions in HES-induced dilutional coagulopathy, that had been controversial before, was amended by a significant impact on ionized calcium and calcium-dependent coagulation parameters, e. g. Quick-value, aPTT, FVIII and von-Willebrand-factor parameters, in vitro. As measured by thromboelastometry, HES-induced coagulopathy did not differ between balanced and non-balanced carrier solution. In conclusion, this in vitro study cannot confirm a benefit of electrolyte-balanced carrier solutions on the coagulation system. To test the hypothesis of an in vitro artifact and for clarity concerning the impact of calcium-containing carrier solutions on levels of ionized calcium in vivo – with functioning calcium homeostasis – clinical studies investigating levels of ionized calcium and FVIII are needed...|$|R
