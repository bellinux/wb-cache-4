50|$|<b>Slack</b> <b>wax,</b> a raw {{refinery}} output comprising {{a mixture}} of oil and wax used as a precursor for scale wax and paraffin wax and as-is in non-food products such as wax emulsions, construction board, matches, candles, rust protection, and vapor barriers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first step}} in making {{paraffin}} wax is to remove the oil (de-oiling or de-waxing) from the <b>slack</b> <b>wax.</b> The oil is separated through crystallization. Most commonly, the <b>slack</b> <b>wax</b> is heated, mixed {{with one or more}} solvents such as a ketone and then cooled. As it cools wax crystallizes out of the solution, leaving only oil in the solution. This mixture is filtered into two streams: solid (wax plus some solvent) and liquid (oil and solvent). After the solvent is recovered by distillation, the resulting products are called [...] "product wax" [...] (or [...] "press wax") and [...] "foots oil". The lower the percentage of oil in the wax the more refined it is considered (semi-refined versus fully refined). The product wax may be further processed to remove colors and odors. The wax may finally be blended together to give certain desired properties such as melt point and penetration. Paraffin wax is sold in either liquid or solid form.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of additives-modifiers (co-reactants) {{on the main}} stages of the technological process of base oils and paraffin manufacturing has been studied. Performance of the oil lube cuts selective treatment with N-methylpyrrolidone extractant can be improved by use of a co-extraction agent (ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol). The refined oils obtained during the selective treatment are worthwhile to be dewaxed {{in the presence of}} ε-caprolactam modifier. The developed measures can significantly im-prove the quality of the wax concentrates due to deep extraction of unwanted components from oil frac-tions and increase the ratio of normal to branched hydrocarbons in gatches (<b>slack</b> <b>waxes)</b> ...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{study has been}} made of the feasibility of adsorptive purification of <b>slack</b> <b>waxes</b> from traces of aromatic compounds using type 13 X molecular sieves to achieve 0. 01 % aromatics in the product. The limited literature relating to the adsorption of high molecular weight aromatic compounds by zeolites was reviewed. Equilibrium isotherms were determined for typical individual aromatic compounds. Lower molecular weight, or more compact, molecules were preferentially adsorbed and the number of molecules captured by one unit cell decreased with increasing molecular weight of the adsorbate. An increase in adsorption temperature resulted in a decrease in the adsorption value. The isosteric heat of adsorption of differnt types of aromatic compounds was determined from pairs of isotherms at 303 K to 343 K at specific coverages. The lowest heats of adsorption were for dodecylbenzene and phenanthrene. Kinetics of adsorption were studied for different aromatic compounds. The diffusivity decreased significantly when a long alkyl chain was attached to the benzene ring e. g. in dodecylbenzene; molecules with small cross-sectional diameter e. g. cumene were adsorbed most rapidly. The sorption rate increased with temperature. Apparent activation energies increased with increasing polarity. In a study of the dynamic adsorption of selected aromatic compounds from binary solutions in isooctane or n-alkanes, naphthalene exhibited the best dynamic properties followed by dibenzothiophene and finally dodecylbenzene. The dynamic adsorption of naphthalene from different n-alkane solvents increased with a decrease in solvent molecular weight. A tentative mathematical approach is proposed for the prediction of dynamic breakthrough curves from equilibrium isotherms and kinetic data. The dynamic properties of liquid phase adsorption of aromatics from <b>slack</b> <b>waxes</b> were studied at different temperatures and concentrations. The optimum operating temperature was 543 K. The best dynamic performance was achieved with feeds of low aromatic content. The studies with individual aromatic compounds demonstrated the affinity of type NaX molecular sieves to adsorb aromatics in the concentration range 3 % - 5 %. Wax purification by adsorption was considered promising and extension of the experimental programme was recommended...|$|R
50|$|Paraffin {{oxidation}} is {{a historical}} industrial process {{for the production of}} synthetic fatty acids. The fatty acids are further processed to consumer products such as soaps and fats as well as to lubricating greases for technical applications. Coal <b>slack</b> <b>wax,</b> a saturated, high molecular weight hydrocarbon mixture and by-product of the Fischer-Tropsch process was used as raw material. Side products were a wide range of carboxylic acids and oxidation products such as alcohols, aldehydes, esters, or ketones. The oxidation of paraffins was carried out in the liquid phase by molecular oxygen in the presence of catalysts such as permanganates, at temperatures in the range of about 100 to 120 °C and under atmospheric pressure.|$|E
50|$|Groups:Lubricant base {{stocks are}} {{categorized}} into five groups by the API. Group I base stocks {{are composed of}} fractionally distilled petroleum which is further refined with solvent extraction processes to improve certain properties such as oxidation resistance and to remove wax. Group II base stocks are composed of fractionally distilled petroleum that has been hydrocracked to further refine and purify it. Group III base stocks have similar characteristics to Group II base stocks, except that Group III base stocks have higher viscosity indexes. Group III base stocks are produced by further hydrocracking of either Group II base stocks or hydroisomerized <b>slack</b> <b>wax</b> (a Group I and II dewaxing process by-product). Group IV base stock are polyalphaolefins (PAOs). Group V is a catch-all group for any base stock not described by Groups I to IV. Examples of group V base stocks include polyolesters (POE), polyalkylene glycols (PAG), and perfluoropolyalkylethers (PFPAEs). Groups I and II are {{commonly referred to as}} mineral oils, group III is typically referred to as synthetic (except in Germany and Japan, where they must not be called synthetic) and group IV is a synthetic oil. Group V base oils are so diverse that there is no catch-all description.|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} of paraffin wax {{separation from the}} high-boiling <b>slack</b> <b>wax</b> by static crystallization has been studied. Gas chromatographic analysis of individual hydrocarbon composition of the high boiling <b>slack</b> <b>wax</b> and its structural-group compos ition by the method of IR Fourier spectroscopy has been determined, experiments on the de-oiling on installation that simulates the operation of industrial crystallizers has been done. It is established that the de-oiling process of the high-boiling <b>slack</b> <b>wax</b> by static crystallization is obtained tightened in time and economically impractical. It has been proposed to introduce the paraffin oil from low-boiling <b>slack</b> <b>wax</b> as a diluent for the high boiling slack. Physical and chemical analysis of individual raw material components and their mixtures has been determined, the process of de-oiling by static crystallization has been done. The introduction of the paraffin oil from low-boiling <b>slack</b> <b>wax</b> into the high-boiling <b>slack</b> <b>wax</b> reduces {{the time and the}} temperature of partial melting phase of static crystallization without worsening the quality of the melt. As a result, the static crystallization goes faster and different technological costs are reduced...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTwo {{petroleum}} waxy by-products (light {{and middle}} <b>slack</b> <b>wax</b> crudes) were evaluated {{for separation of}} non-polar modifiers by using different techniques. The results showed that, the light <b>slack</b> <b>wax</b> is selected as a suitable wax for separation of n-alkanes with even number of carbon atoms ranging from C 20 to C 26 for their high n-paraffin contents {{and can be used}} as non-polar structural modifiers. Different separation techniques; multistage fractional crystallization and liquid–solid chromatography; followed by the urea adduction technique have been used to separate non-polar modifier concentrates from the light <b>slack</b> <b>wax</b> crude. The light <b>slack</b> <b>wax,</b> its saturate components, the hard wax fractions isolated from light <b>slack</b> <b>wax</b> by the multistage fractional crystallization technique and their adducts were analyzed by GC to characterize and compare the produced components. The resulting data reveal that, the adducts of light <b>slack</b> <b>wax</b> and its saturate components; can be used as non-polar modifier concentrates of low carbon atoms (C 20 +C 22). From an economic point of view, the light <b>slack</b> <b>wax</b> adduct is selected as a non-polar modifier concentrate whereas, the separation step can be neglected to save energy. Meanwhile, the adduct of the hard wax isolated at 30 °C can be used as the preferable non-polar modifier concentrate of the high carbon number atoms (C 24 +C 26) ...|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis {{consists of a}} literature review, presented in two papers, and another six papers describing experimental studies {{of the influence of}} different kinds of wax and polyphosporic acid on bitumen and asphalt concrete mixture properties. The literature review should give an extensive description of the field of knowledge concerning wax in bitumen. Effects of wax in crude oil, bitumen and asphalt concrete as well as test methods for studying these effects are described. Theories behind possible mechanisms are also discussed, and commercial wax as additive to bitumen for different purposes included. The experimental parts comprise laboratory studies involving totally five 160 / 220 penetration base bitumens from different sources, two isolated bitumen waxes, five commercial waxes and one polyphosphoric acid. Asphalt concrete slabs, containing base or modified bitumen were prepared and tested. Binder properties were evaluated using different types of laboratory equipment, such as dynamic shear rheometer (DSR), bending beam rheometer (BBR), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), force ductilometer, as well as equipment for determining conventional parameters like penetration, softening point, viscosity, and Fraass breaking point. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC-FID) were used for chemical characterization. The binders were aged by means of the rolling thin film oven test (RTFOT) and pressure ageing vessel (PAV) in combination. Asphalt concrete properties were evaluated at low temperatures using the tensile strain restrained specimen test (TSRST) and creep test at - 25 °C. Dynamic creep testing was performed at 40 °C, as well as complex modulus tests between 0 and 20 °C. Binder test results indicated that the magnitude and type of effect on bitumen rheology depend on the bitumen itself, type of crystallizing fraction in the bitumen and/or type and amount of additive used. Bitumen composition was found to be of decisive importance. Adding polyethylene wax or polyphosphoric acid, especially to a non-waxy 160 / 220 penetration grade bitumen, showed no or positive effects on the rheological behaviour at low temperatures (decrease in stiffness) as well as medium and high temperatures (increase in complex modulus and decrease in phase angle). However, the corresponding positive effects could not be shown in dynamic creep testing (at 40 °C) of asphalt concrete mixtures containing these modified binders. Adding FT-paraffin decreased the physical hardening index for all bitumens. Also polyethylene wax and montan wax showed this effect for some bitumens. <b>Slack</b> <b>wax</b> showed a large increasing effect on physical hardening, and polyphosphoric acid none or a minor negative effect. No correlation between physical hardening index (PHI) and wax content by DSC was found in this study, involving both natural bitumen wax and commercial wax. Addition of the commercial waxes used showed no or marginally positive influence on bitumen ageing properties for the bitumens and test conditions used. Comparing asphalt mixture test results to the corresponding binder test results, the effects on asphalt mixtures from adding commercial wax or polyphosphoric acid were less evident. Significant binder physical hardening by BBR could not be confirmed by TSRST. QC 2010100...|$|E
