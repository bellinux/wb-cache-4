25|$|Though too {{numerous}} to list, the city has a <b>surprising</b> <b>number</b> of architecturally significant late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century buildings and skyscrapers. Daniel Burnham, Louis Kamper, and the Smith Hinchman & Grylls firm are among the architects who designed some of the city's other important skyscrapers {{at the turn of}} the century which endure today. Burnham's three remaining Detroit skyscraper designs are the Neo-Classical styled Chrysler House (1912) — renovated in 2002, and the Neo-Renaissance Whitney (1915) and Ford (1909) buildings.

Shifting was accomplished by three-speed (column or floor shift) and four-speed manuals or Turbo Hydra-Matic. Novas might also be equipped with a heavy-duty suspension or the F41 sport suspension. A <b>surprising</b> <b>number</b> of police departments ordered Novas with either a 305- or 350-cubic-inch V-8 engine, {{following the lead of}} the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department, which had given the compacts an exhaustive evaluation.|$|E
25|$|Through the 1970s, Alpine {{continued}} to campaign the A110, {{and later the}} Alpine A310 replacement car. However, to compete with Alpine's success, other manufacturers developed increasingly special cars, notably the Lancia Stratos which was based closely on the A110's size and rear-engined concept, though incorporating a Ferrari engine. Alpine's own cars, still based on the 1962 design and using a <b>surprising</b> <b>number</b> of production parts, became increasingly uncompetitive. In 1974 Alpine built a series of factory racing Renault 17 Gordinis (one driven by Jean-Luc Thérier) that won the Press on Regardless World Rally Championship round in Michigan, US.|$|E
25|$|The Soviets {{developed}} successful group aerial fighting tactics for the Bell {{fighters and}} scored a <b>surprising</b> <b>number</b> of aerial victories over {{a variety of}} German aircraft. Low ceilings, short missions, good radios, a sealed and warm cockpit and ruggedness contributed to their effectiveness. To pilots who had once flown the tricky Polikarpov I-16, the aerodynamic quirks of the mid-engined aircraft were unimportant. In the Far East, P-63 and P-39 aircraft {{were used in the}} Soviet invasion of Manchukuo and northern Korea. In the Pacific theatre, the Kingcobras flew escort, close air support and ground attack missions. The Soviet P-63s achieved their first air victory on 15 August 1945, when Lejtenant I. F.

In his first two years in Washington, he scored just 8 goals in 108 games, and was demoted briefly to the AHL. However, he established himself as a key member of the team in 1985-86, and put up <b>surprising</b> <b>numbers</b> with 18 goals and 56 points, along with 152 PIM.

The resulting scandal was known as the Hastings Rarities affair, with Bristow the central figure as the presumed perpetrator of the fraud.

DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented that [...] "this excellent episode includes a <b>surprising</b> <b>number</b> of concurrent plots. Homer also {{works in the}} casino and tries {{to care for the}} family without Marge. It balances them deftly and provides great laughs along the way." [...] Adam Suraf of Dunkirkma.net named it the third best episode of the season. He also praised the episode's cultural references. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "There's a lovely nod to the earlier episodes in which Marge protests the citizenry's hare-brained ideas at council meetings. A series of bizarre moments rather than a story—we're especially fond of Homer's photographic memory and Mr Burns' descent into insanity—but great fun." [...] Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a grade of A, and Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave it a score of 4 out of 5. The episode is Sarah Culp of The Quindecims eleventh-favorite episode of the show, and one of Les Winan of Box Office Prophets's favorite episodes. A scene from the episode where former United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger meets Burns was included in the 2002 documentary film The Trials of Henry Kissinger.|$|E
500|$|A {{shift in}} context was the obvious {{starting}} point {{in many of}} these works and, where sufficiently original, contributed to the author’s own literary fortunes. This was the case with Edward Jerningham’s The Nunnery: an elegy in imitation of the Elegy in a Churchyard, published in 1762. Profiting by its success, Jerningham followed it up in successive years with other poems on the theme of nuns, in which the connection with Gray’s work, though less close, was maintained in theme, form and emotional tone: “The Magdalens: an elegy” (1763); “The Nun: an elegy” (1764); and “An Elegy Written Among the Ruins of an Abbey” (1765), which is derivative of the earlier poems on ruins by Moore and Cunningham. At the opposite extreme, Gray’s poem provided a format for a <b>surprising</b> <b>number</b> that purport to be personal descriptions of life in gaol, starting with “An elegy in imitation of Gray, written in the King's Bench Prison by a minor “ (London 1790), which is close in title to William Thomas Moncrieff’s later [...] "Prison Thoughts: An elegy, written in the King's Bench Prison", dating from 1816 and printed in 1821. In 1809, H.P.Houghton wrote “An evening's contemplation in a French prison, being a humble imitation of Gray's Elegy” while he was a prisoner at Arras during the Napoleonic wars (London 1809). It was followed next year by the bitter “Elegy in Newgate”, published in The Satirist in the character of the recently imprisoned William Cobbett.|$|E

As a result, American and Least Bitterns, King Rail, Common Moorhen, and several American Coot nests in Sarpy Co were reported. However, Great and Snowy Egrets were scarce, and Black-necked Stilts were absent from the eastern Rainwater Basin after several good breeding years there. First breeding records for the state are always exciting; Lesser Goldfinch finally took the plunge this year in Banner Co. Also encouraging were increased reports of Black-billed Cuckoo (9) and both Black-billed Magpie and Black-capped Chickadee.
