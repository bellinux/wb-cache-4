5|$|Illingworth was {{selected}} to make his first-class début for Victoria against Tasmania at Kardinia Park in Geelong in February 1962. His selection had generated controversy since he had twice been no-balled for throwing by two different umpires in Melbourne district cricket in the two seasons prior to his selection. One of the occasions in district cricket, he had been no-balled three times in one over. At the time, Tasmania {{were not in the}} Sheffield Shield competition, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> one-off match.|$|E
5|$|Unlike other Australian touring teams, the 1884 team {{organised}} {{the project}} themselves and <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> private business venture which involved {{none of the}} Australian colonial cricket associations.

5|$|Another large {{building}} lies crosswise at {{the south}} end of the east range. Its lower level consists of a vaulted hall equipped with a grand thirteenth century hooded fireplace and its own garderobe. It is not clear what this chamber was used for, but it may have been the monastic infirmary—if <b>so,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> most unusual, perhaps unique, arrangement. Normally in a medieval Cistercian monastery an infirmary with its own kitchens, chapel and ancillary buildings would have been located east of the main buildings around a second, smaller cloister, but at Netley these seem to be absent. So far, excavations have not revealed whether Netley had a separate infirmary complex.|$|E

5|$|Supplies for {{the advance}} were transported over land and by sea {{but it was}} only with great {{difficulty}} that two infantry divisions of XXI Corps and three mounted divisions of Desert Mounted Corps were maintained in the advance at such distances from base. The Navy transported stores to the mouths of the Wadi Hesi and the Nahr Sukherier as these lines were secured. The railhead was being pushed forward as rapidly as possible, but did not reach Deir Suneid until 28 November. <b>So</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> considerable distance over which the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps worked to bring up supplies.|$|E
5|$|When we came {{to record}} it in the studio we {{struggled}} because there was something just not quite right about it and I wasn't happy about where we'd left it and where we were happy to leave it and we couldn't put our finger on what it was and <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> really nice day one day, me and Chris were just trying, I was actually just trying to record bass {{at the time and}} me and Chris were just sitting down trying to brainstorm it and work out what was wrong and so I started trying to just do a few different bass lines and stuff. Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E

25|$|On June 28, 2007, Thomas hit the 500th {{home run}} of his career, {{becoming}} the 21st major league player to do <b>so.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> three-run shot off Minnesota's Carlos Silva (Thomas' 500th home run {{came on the}} same day Craig Biggio hit his 3,000th career hit).

25|$|Regarding {{comments}} he made {{suggesting that}} contracts for the mega-fight {{were close to}} being finalized, De La Hoya told BoxingScene.com on July 26, 2010: I think I said it because I get the question asked so many times that, obviously, I was fed up and tired of it and I just said like, yeah, yeah, it's gonna get made. <b>So</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> quick answer that I should have obviously thought about.

25|$|The {{next step}} came in 1898, when the Dutch East Indies {{government}} established {{a new school}} to train medical doctors, named STOVIA (School tot Opleiding van Inlandsche Artsen). A school building was opened in March 1902, in a building that is now the Museum of National Awakening. The prerequisite to enter STOVIA was roughly {{the equivalent of a}} junior high school diploma. The schooling took nine years, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> mix between high school and university education. Many STOVIA graduates later played important roles in Indonesia's national movement toward independence, as well in developing medical education in Indonesia.|$|E

25|$|Both {{teams had}} {{exceptional}} long batting line-ups, only Barry Jarman, Garth McKenzie, Fred Trueman and Brian Statham {{had failed to}} make a first-class hundred and Trueman and Jarman would make their maiden centuries in 1963-64. This was the sixth time the two teams had played at the Gabba, England winning the two Tests played before to the war by 6 wickets (1932-33) and 322 runs (1936-37), and Australia the four Tests since the war by an innings and 332 runs (1946-47), 70 runs (1950-51), an innings and 154 runs (1954-55) and 8 wickets (1958-59), <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> ground where a result was expected.|$|E
25|$|Botham {{continued}} to make progress in 1975. Somerset struggled in the County Championship, winning only four of their twenty matches and finished joint 12th. In the JPL, they slumped badly from second to 14th. They reached the quarter-final of the B Cup but only {{the second round of}} the Gillette Cup. Botham played in 22 first-class and 23 List A matches <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> busy season for him. In first-class, he scored 584 runs with a highest of 65, one of two half-centuries, and held 18 catches. He took 62 wickets, doubling his 1974 tally, with a best of five for 69, his only 5wI that season. In List A, he scored 232 runs with a highest of 38* and held seven catches. He took 32 wickets with a best of three for 34.|$|E
25|$|Manchester United {{were the}} first side to emerge, despite club {{football}} itself first originating in Yorkshire. The club was founded in 1878 as Newton Heath L by employees of Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, with the company — as the name suggests — covering both historic counties. The club's new owners later changed their name to Manchester United in 1902. Leeds had traditionally been a rugby league city <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> while before the attraction of football finally appealed to the local people. An association football club was finally made though in 1904, when Leeds City emerged. The two sides clashed {{for the first time}} in the Second Division at Manchester United's Bank Street stadium on 15 January 1906 in front of 6,000 fans. Leeds City won the game 3–0, but United won the return game at Elland Road 2–1 in April.|$|E

25|$|Twain {{accepted}} {{an offer from}} Robert Sparrow Smythe and embarked on a year-long, around the world lecture tour in July 1895 to pay off his creditors in full, although {{he was no longer}} under any legal obligation to do <b>so.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> long, arduous journey and he was sick much of the time, mostly from a cold and a carbuncle. The first part of the itinerary took him across northern America to British Columbia, Canada, until the second half of August. For the second part, he sailed across the Pacific Ocean. His scheduled lecture in Honolulu, Hawaii had to be cancelled due to a cholera epidemic. Twain went on to Fiji, Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, India, Mauritius, and South Africa. His three months in India became the centerpiece of his 712-page book Following the Equator. In the second half of July 1896, he sailed back to England, completing his circumnavigation of the world begun 14 months before.|$|E
25|$|In April, Bengaluru {{played the}} home game against Royal Wahingdoh. The game saw flurry of goals with Robin Singh, Shankar Sampingiraj, Josh Walker {{countering}} three goals by the visiting {{team and the}} game ended at 3–3. Before the next game against Mumbai, Bengaluru were trailing by 3 points to the table topper Mohun Bagan, in spite of having played 2 more games, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> crucial match for Bengaluru {{to stay in the}} title hunt, but the game turned out to be 4th consecutive draw between the two sides. In spite of continuous attack by Bengaluru, the first half remained goalless. In the second half, against the run of the play, Rahul Bheke scored the goal for visitors {{to take the lead in}} 67th minute. Bengaluru intensified the attack and Robin Singh equalized in the closing minutes before he was sent-off. The next game for Bengaluru was another top of the table clash with Pune F.C.. Bengaluru quickly got ahead when Shankar Sampingiraj scored the fastest goal of the season and the second fastest I-League goal of all time, in 15 seconds. Bengaluru doubled the lead just before half-time when C.K. Vineeth scored a goal from Beikhokhei Beingaichho's pass and Bengaluru scored their first ever win against Pune team. In three days, Bengaluru faced another Pune based team Bharat FC. Facing the depleted time, Bengaluru easily won the game 2–0 with goals from Eugeneson Lyngdoh and C.K. Vineeth in each half respectively, with both the assists coming from Sean Rooney.|$|E
