5000|$|The P.V.3 {{made its}} maiden flight on 15 June 1934, piloted by George Bulman and {{powered by a}} 695 hp (518 kW) Goshawk II engine. [...] Official trials of the F7/30 types were delayed until 1935 owing to {{problems}} {{with some of the}} other competitors, and Hawker used the delay to fit a slightly more powerful version of the Goshawk. While the P.V.3 was praised for its handling and performance during testing at RAF Martlesham Heath, no order resulted, as in the mean time Gloster's Gladiator, another Private Venture design, had been ordered into production. The Gladiator was powered by an air-cooled Bristol Mercury radial engine, and so avoided any need for a heavy and vulnerable <b>steam</b> <b>condensor</b> system.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the performance analysis of {{geothermal power plant}} which consist of some main components such as final separator, <b>steam</b> turbine, <b>condensor,</b> cooling tower and others. Observed geothermal power plant {{is the one that}} is dominated by working fluid, which vapour-dominated system. Based on the result of the performance analysis using exergy analysis method, the irreversibility at final separator, <b>steam</b> turbin, <b>condensor</b> and cooling tower consecutively is 12. 80 MW, 24. 65 MW, 3. 084 MW and 3. 823 MW...|$|R
50|$|Steam-cycle plants (nuclear, coal, NG, solar thermal) {{require a}} great deal of water for cooling, to remove the heat at the <b>steam</b> <b>condensors.</b> The amount of water needed {{relative}} to plant output will be reduced with increasing boiler temperatures. Coal- and gas-fired boilers can produce high steam temperatures and so are more efficient, and require less cooling water relative to output. Nuclear boilers are limited in steam temperature by material constraints, and solar is limited by concentration of the energy source.|$|R
