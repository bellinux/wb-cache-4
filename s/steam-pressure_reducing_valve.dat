Pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>valves</b> are used for flow rate control of the compressible superheated steam in these piping systems.

In order to analyze the internal flow characteristics of the compressible superheated steam and the flow rate adjustment performance of the proposed pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>valve,</b> a numerical model of DN 80 pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>valve</b> is established. Then, the flow characteristics inside are studied numerically. Meanwhile, the flow rate adjustment performance is also carried out experimentally.

50|$|Historically, {{electricity}} generation from water pipelines was rare because {{the water would}} have been pumped by other engines in the system prior to the intake of water turbines to generate electricity.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} optimal pressure management in water distribution systems through the introduction and regulation of pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>valves.</b> Reduction in pressure is aimed at controlling water leakages which, being in some cases {{a high proportion of}} the total volume supplied, are nowadays one of the major concerns for water utilities. The determination of the number, location, and setting of such valves is formulated as a two criteria optimization problem and is solved with multiobjective genetic algorithms. In particular, the first criterion is represented by the minimization of the number of valves, and the second is the minimization of the total leakage in the system, when maintaining the required pressure at each node. The great advantage of the multiobjective approach resides in the fact that, in one run, several trade-off alternatives are found, thus providing the set of the optimal solutions with a different level of compromise between the conflicting objectives. At the same time, data necessary for practical choice and operation of pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>valves</b> may be determined...|$|R

This can be done by letting turbines replace the pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>valves.</b> In this thesis an investigation has been done of the conditions today, the conditions after the change from pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>valves</b> to turbines and a comparison of three different types of turbine solutions. The three examined solutions are one turbine, several helical screw expanders and several small turbines in parallel with asynchronous generators. The six absorption heat pumps have been divided into two groups; one group of four and one group of two absorption heat pumps. An investigation of locations and space in nearby switchgears has been done for each group. Contacts with retailers of the examined turbine solutions have been taken to gather technical specifications. These technical specifications have been used to simulate the electricity production and the economical yield of each type of examined solution. The investigation shows that the best solution is the solution with several small turbines with asynchronous generators. It has lower investment cost (15 [MSEK]) and the best yield. The proposed solutions will have an installed capacity of 2. 65 [MW] to a cost of 5 601 [SEK/kW]. The electric energy production will be 15. 7 [GWh/year].

40|$|Hydraulic {{simulation}} of water distribution systems using computer software {{appears to have}} reached a very mature level of practice. There {{does not appear to}} be many other improvements that can be made to the basic underlying solution algorithms. While this statement is mostly true, there still remains one area that results in problems when developing simulation models. In discussions with water distribution modeling practitioners, the most commonly mentioned remaining problem is stability of computers programs in the presence of pressure regulating devices. The three most common pressure regulating devices are pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>valves,</b> flow control valves and pressure sustaining valves. The difficulty in computer codes is that the status of the device is not known a priori. Consider a pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>valve</b> (PRV) — it may have one of three states. For the first state, the valve operates normally - such that the valve is in a partially closed or throttling position to maintain the set pressure on the downstream side of the valve. The second state occurs when the pressure downstream of the valve cannot be maintained and drops below the set pressure. In this case the valve moves to a fully open position. For the third state, the PRV acts as check valve. If there is more than one pressure regulating valve in a water distribution system then each device may be in one of three states. In computer codes, a guess is made to the status of each of the pressure regulating devices and the system is solved for to determine the flows and pressures. A check is then made to determine if the guesses of status are consistent with the results. If the assumed status of the device is inconsistent with the results the status is altered and the hydraulic solver is re-run. This paper demonstrates with a simple example that has a combination of a pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>valve</b> and a flow control valve that many commonly available commercial programs and Government programs cannot properly model even the simplest of systems.
