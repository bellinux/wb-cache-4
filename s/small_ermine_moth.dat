40|$|Sex pheromones are the {{hallmark}} of reproductive behavior in moths. Mature females perform the task of mate signaling and release bouquets of odors that attract conspecific males at long range. The pheromone chemistry follows a relatively minimal design but still the combinatorial action {{of a handful of}} specialized pheromone production enzymes has resulted in remarkably diverse sexual signals that subtly vary in structure and in number and ratio of components. In a recent article, 1 we showed that a single reductase gene (pgFAR) enables the conversion of key biosynthetic fatty-acyl precursors into fatty alcohols, the immediate precursors of the multi-component pheromone in small ermine moths (Lepidoptera: Yponomeutidae). In the light of the widespread usage of multi-component pheromone blends across Lepidoptera, {{it is likely that the}} pgFAR biochemical flexibility is a regular feature of the moth pheromone machinery and polyvalent reductase genes are emerging as pivots to promote phenotypic transitions in moth mating signals. In addition, the <b>small</b> <b>ermine</b> <b>moth</b> pgFAR nevertheless contributes to regulating the ratio among components. Here we show that the pgFAR substrate specificity is actually counterbalancing the inherent chain-length preference of an upstream desaturase with Δ 11 -activity and that the enzymes together modulate the final blend ratio between the Z 11 - 16 :OH, Z 11 - 14 :OH and E 11 - 14 :OH compounds before the final acetylation...|$|E
40|$|According to {{sympatric}} speciation theory, adaptation to different host plants {{is expected to}} pleiotropically lead to assortative mating, {{an important factor in}} the reduction of gene flow between the diverging subpopulations. This scenario predicts mating on and oviposition preference for the respective hosts in both the diverging subpopulations and recently originated species. Here, we test both predictions in the oligophagous Yponomeuta padellus (L.) and the monophagous Yponomeuta cagnagellus (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Yponomeutidae), two closely related <b>small</b> <b>ermine</b> <b>moth</b> species from the western European clade of Yponomeuta for which speciation in sympatry has been proposed. Mating location and adult host acceptance were evaluated under both semi-field (in a large outdoor cage with a choice of host and non-host plants) and field conditions. In the semi-field experiment, only Y. cagnagellus showed some preference for mating on its own host (16 % of all mating pairs) over non-host plants (3 % of all mating pairs). However, in both species, more than 80 % of the mating pairs were not formed on a plant but instead on the cage itself. Further examination of the mating site of Y. cagnagellus in the field revealed no preference for host plants over non-host plants in the two consecutive years of observation. Yponomeuta padellus females, collected from and reared on Prunus spinosa L. (Rosaceae), showed an oviposition preference for the alternative host Crataegus monogyna Jacq. (Rosaceae) in the semi-field experiment. We thus found no evidence that host-plant fidelity (in terms of mating site) has been the driving force in the speciation process of these Yponomeuta species, nor did we find evidence of host race formation in the tested population of the oligophagous Y. padellus...|$|E
40|$|Background: The <b>small</b> <b>ermine</b> <b>moth</b> genus Yponomeuta (Lepidoptera, Yponomeutidae) {{contains}} 76 {{species that}} are specialist feeders on hosts from Celastraceae, Rosaceae, Salicaceae, and several other plant families. The genus is a model for studies {{in the evolution of}} phytophagous insects and their host-plant associations. Here, we reconstruct the phylogeny to provide a solid framework for these studies, and to obtain insight into the history of host-plant use and the biogeography of the genus. Methodology/Principal Findings: DNA sequences from an internal transcribed spacer region (ITS- 1) and from the 16 S rDNA (16 S) and cytochrome oxidase (COII) mitochondrial genes were collected from 20 - 23 (depending on gene) species and two outgroup taxa to reconstruct the phylogeny of the Palaearctic members of this genus. Sequences were analysed using three different phylogenetic methods (parsimony, likelihood, and Bayesian inference). Conclusions/Significance: Roughly the same patterns are retrieved irrespective of the method used, and they are similar among the three genes. Monophyly is well supported for a clade consisting of the Japanese (but not the Dutch) population of Yponomeuta sedellus and Y. yanagawanus, a Y. kanaiellus-polystictus clade, and a Rosaceae-feeding, western Palaearctic clade (Y. cagnagellus-irrorellus clade). Within these clades, relationships are less well supported, and the patterns between the different gene trees are not so similar. The position of the remaining taxa is also variable among the gene trees and rather weakly supported. The phylogenetic information was used to elucidate patterns of biogeography and resource use. In the Palaearctic, the genus most likely originated in the Far East, feeding on Celastraceae, dispersing to the West concomitant with a shift to Rosaceae and further to Salicaceae. The association of Y. cagnagellus with Euonymus europaeus (Celastraceae), however, is a reversal. The only oligophagous species, Y. padellus, belongs to the derived western Palaearctic clade, evidence that specialisation is reversible...|$|E
40|$|Taxonomically the European <b>small</b> <b>ermine</b> <b>moths</b> (Yponomeuta spp.) {{fall into}} two groups, one having two {{distinct}} species, the other two species and the so-called "Padellus"-complex. The five members of this complex,which are morphologically very similar,can interbreed in the laboratory, but under natural conditions, although occurring sympatrically, they are reproductively isolated. Thus, they are {{generally considered to be}} transitional forms undergoing a speciation process. Two behavioural aspects appear to be of prime importance in this process. First, a marked preference for certain host plants, which is different in each form and second, a clear preference in males for conspecific females. The sensory reception of odour signals is integral to both these aspects. The current study analyses the role of antennal odour receptors in this speciation process. [...] . Zie: Summary...|$|R
40|$|Moths {{depend on}} {{pheromone}} communication for mate finding and synthetic pheromones {{are used for}} monitoring or disruption of pheromone communication in pest insects. Here we produce moth sex pheromone, using Nicotiana benthamiana as a plant factory, by transient expression of up to four genes coding for consecutive biosynthetic steps. We specifically produce multicomponent sex pheromones for two species. The fatty alcohol fractions from the genetically modified plants are acetylated to mimic the respective sex pheromones of the <b>small</b> <b>ermine</b> <b>moths</b> Yponomeuta evonymella and Y. padella. These mixtures are very efficient and specific for trapping of male moths, matching the activity of conventionally produced pheromones. Our long-term vision is to design tailor-made production of any moth pheromone component in genetically modified plants. Such semisynthetic preparation of sex pheromones is a novel and cost-effective way of producing moderate to large quantities of pheromones with high purity and a minimum of hazardous waste...|$|R
40|$|The {{degree of}} {{polyandry}} in a species {{is linked to}} other life history traits such as egg maturation, life span, and male ejaculate size and quality. The study of differences in mating strategies between closely related species can provide {{a better understanding of}} the evolution of these strategies and of sperm competition. Mating patterns of two closely related species of <b>small</b> <b>ermine</b> <b>moths</b> (Yponomeuta) were investigated in the laboratory. The average female age at first mating was higher in Y. cagnagellus than in Y. padellus. Both species mated more than once; however, Y. cagnagellus females were more likely to remate in a short time frame. Moreover, Y. cagnagellus had higher life time female mating frequencies than Y. padellus (viz., 3. 0 versus 2. 0). These differences in mating frequency were confirmed in the field by examining the presence of spermatophores (or their remains) in the bursa as well as sperm in the spermatheca of field-caught females...|$|R
40|$|Several {{evolutionary}} {{explanations for}} multiple mating in insects have been proposed, {{and it has}} been suggested that Lepidoptera benefit from the energy contained in nuptial gifts. In two closely related species of <b>small</b> <b>ermine</b> <b>moths,</b> Yponomeuta cagnagellus (Hübner) and Yponomeuta padellus (L.), we experimentally controlled the number of matings and access to honey as an energy source, and assessed the effects of these factors on female life span and lifetime fecundity. No positive effects of mating were found in either species. In fact, mating significantly shortened life span. The effect of access to energy in the form of honey differed between the two species. In the shorter-lived Yponomeuta padellus, access to honey did not increase the life span of mated females and did not increase fecundity. In Yponomeuta cagnagellus however, access to energy in the form of honey counteracted the negative effects of mating and females with access to honey lived significantly longer and laid significantly more eggs during their lifetime...|$|R
40|$|Fatty-acyl CoA reductases (FAR) convert {{fatty acids}} into fatty {{alcohols}} in pro- and eukaryotic organisms. In the Lepidoptera, {{members of the}} FAR gene family serve in the biosynthesis of sex pheromones involved in mate communication. We used a group of closely related species, the <b>small</b> <b>ermine</b> <b>moths</b> (Lepidoptera: Yponomeutidae) as a model to investigate the role of FARs in the biosynthesis of complex pheromone blends. Homology-based molecular cloning in three Yponomeuta species led to the identification of multiple putative FAR transcripts homologous to FAR genes from the Bombyx mori genome. The expression of one transcript was restricted to the female pheromone-gland tissue, suggesting a role in pheromone biosynthesis, and the encoded protein belonged to a recently identified Lepidoptera-specific pgFAR gene subfamily. The Yponomeuta evonymellus pgFAR mRNA was up-regulated in sexually mature females and exhibited a 24 -h cyclic fluctuation pattern peaking in the pheromone production period. Heterologous expression confirmed that the Yponomeuta pgFAR orthologs in all three species investigated [Y. evonymellus (L.), Yponomeuta padellus (L.), and Yponomeuta rorellus (Hübner) ] encode a functional FAR with a broad substrate range that efficiently promoted accumulation of primary alcohols in recombinant yeast supplied {{with a series of}} biologically relevant C 14 - or C 16 -acyl precursors. Taken together, our data evidence that a single alcohol-producing pgFAR played a critical function in the production of the multicomponent pheromones of yponomeutids and support the hypothesis of moth pheromone-biosynthetic FARs belonging to a FAR gene subfamily unique to Lepidoptera...|$|R
