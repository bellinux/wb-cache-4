We show that the symmetries of the solutions are encoded in the holonomy around the spatial circle. When the spatial holonomies of the solutions are trivial, they preserve maximal symmetries of the theory, and are actually the <b>smooth</b> <b>conical</b> defects.

In the bosonic higher spin cases, there are one-to-one correspondences between the <b>smooth</b> <b>conical</b> defects and the highest weight representations of Lie group. Furthermore we investigate the higher spin black holes in $osp(3 | 2) $ and $sl(3 | 2) $ higher spin (super-) gravity and find that they are only partially symmetric. In general, the black holes break all the supersymmetries, but in some cases they preserve part of the supersymmetries.

30|$|Whilst we {{acknowledge}} that mechanical reasons predominantly dictate the rod/strut configurations when building a circular frame, {{the effect of}} rod coupling during CT imaging can be minimised. Firstly, all or all but one rod can be removed during imaging; we see this as the ideal (Fig.  4), as in these cases there is no rod coupling. If {{this is not a}} possibility at that particular time, the second option is to configure the rods in a way that minimises the effect of the rod coupling on the area of interest. It can be appreciated in Fig.  6 {{that in the case of}} a four-rod construct, simply switching the two anterior rods to a more central single one will achieve this goal without particularly jeopardising mechanical strength for a short period. In the case of hexapod frames, whilst temporarily switching struts for rods would also appear to be a good idea, this can be more time-consuming, as often with hexapods the rings are not parallel, and therefore requiring the use of dished (<b>conical)</b> <b>washers</b> or the construction of hinges.|$|R

We asked whether using a one-wire method that corrects minor malalignment with an olive traction wire placed in {{the plane of the}} deformity allowed (1) uniform healing, (2) proper alignment, and (3) adequate reduction of fracture gaps. We retrospectively evaluated 72 patients in whom we used closed tibial fracture reduction using a circular external frame. We identified the plane of the residual deformity after alignment on a traction table using a C-arm. In this plane, the final correction was performed with traction through an olive wire. Satisfactory alignment (less than 3 ° deviation from normal) was obtained in 68 of the 72 patients (94 %), and satisfactory reduction (gaps less than 2  mm) attained in 51 (71 %). In no case was the fracture site opened surgically.

In fact, this lateral component may represent a relatively large volume, which challenges the cleaning phase of the instrumentation procedure in that tissue remnants of the vital or necrotic pulp as well as infectious elements are not easily removed in these areas. Thus, the image of root canals having a <b>smooth,</b> <b>conical</b> shape is generally too idealistic and underestimates the reach of root canal instrumentation.|$|R

The square, angular outline, and black colour of the Barn, at once show that it belongs to the basaltic series; whilst the <b>smooth,</b> <b>conical</b> figure, and the varied bright tints of Flagstaff Hill, render it equally clear, that it is composed of the softened, feldspathic rocks. These two lofty hills are connected (as is shown in Figure 8) by a sharp ridge, which is composed of the rubbly lavas of the basal series. The strata of this ridge dip westward, the inclination becoming less and less towards the Flagstaff; and the upper feldspathic strata of this hill can be seen, though with some difficulty, to dip conformably to the W.S.W. Close to the Barn, the strata of the ridge are nearly vertical, but are much obscured by innumerable dikes; under this hill, they probably change from being vertical into being inclined into an opposite direction; for the upper or basaltic strata, which are about eight hundred or one thousand feet in thickness, are inclined north-eastward, at an angle between thirty and forty degrees.|$|R
40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} {{simulations of}} nanoscratching are performed {{with emphasis on}} {{the correlation between the}} scratching conditions and the defect mechanism in the substrate. More than six million atoms are described by the embedded atom method (EAM) potential. The scratching process is simulated by high-speed ploughing on the Al(111) surface with an atomic force microscope (AFM) tip that is geometrically modelled to be of a <b>smoothed</b> <b>conical</b> shape. A repulsive model potential is employed to represent the interaction between the AFM tip and the Al atoms. Through the visualization technique of atomic coordination number, dislocations and vacancies are identified as the two major defect types prevailing under nanoscratching. Their structures and movements are investigated for understanding the mechanisms of defect generation and evolution under various scratching conditions. The glide patterns of Shockley partial dislocation loops are obviously dependent upon the scratching directions in conjunction with the slip system of face-centred cubic (fee) single crystals. It is shown that the shape of the AFM tip directly influences the facet formation on the scratched groove. The penetration depth into the substrate during scratching is further verified to affect both surface pile-up and residual defect generations that are important in assessing the change of material properties after scratching. close 403...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} the phase centre of a pure mode, <b>smooth</b> wall, <b>conical</b> horn is studied. The method {{employed}} uses phase information obtained by aperture {{integration of the}} phase corrected mode field but differs from earlier presentations in first reducing the radiation integrals {{in terms of an}} identified family of functions prior to integration. The result is formulas for the principal plane radiation patterns that better exemplify operation of the antenna. The procedure uses these formulas together with least squares minimization to determine a best fit phase centre for each principal plane. It is shown that contrary to published results, even in its principal planes, there is no unique phase centre that is a property of the horn alone. The use of such a horn as the feed element of a radio-optical antenna system is then considered. It is shown that in situations where cost is paramount and the well known drawbacks of its unequal principal plane beamwidths and the diminished gain that results from lackof a uniquely defined phase centre can be tolerated, perhaps contrary to conventional wisdom, the pure mode, <b>smooth</b> wall, <b>conical</b> horn does have a useful role to play. This is illustrated by a design example in which such a horn was used to feed a 6. 4 m. dish working in X-band with a Gregorian feed system. The result is confirmation of the usefulness of the method presented here for location of a best fit phase centre. 1...|$|R

60|$|The basal {{strata of}} these hills, {{as well as}} some neighbouring, separate, bare, rounded hillocks, consist of compact, fine-grained, non-crystalline (or so {{slightly}} as scarcely to be perceptible), ferruginous, feldspathic rocks, and generally in a state of semi-decomposition. Their fracture is exceedingly irregular, and splintery; yet small fragments are often very tough. They contain much ferruginous matter, either in the form of minute grains with a metallic lustre, or of brown hair-like threads: the rock in this latter case assuming a pseudo-brecciated structure. These rocks sometimes contain mica and veins of agate. Their rusty brown or yellowish colour is partly due to the oxides of iron, but chiefly to innumerable, microscopically minute, black specks, which, when a fragment is heated, are easily fused, and evidently are either hornblende or augite. These rocks, therefore, although at first appearing like baked clay or some altered sedimentary deposit, contain all the essential ingredients of trachyte; from which they differ only in not being harsh, and in not containing crystals of glassy feldspar. As is so often the case with trachytic formation, no stratification is here apparent. A person would not readily believe that these rocks could have flowed as lava; yet at St. Helena there are well-characterised streams (as will be described in an ensuing chapter) of nearly similar composition. Amidst the hillocks composed of these rocks, I found in three places, <b>smooth</b> <b>conical</b> hills of phonolite, abounding with fine crystals of glassy feldspar, and with needles of hornblende. These cones of phonolite, I believe, bear the same relation to the surrounding feldspathic strata which some masses of coarsely crystallised augitic rock, {{in another part of the}} island, bear to the surrounding basalt, namely, that both have been injected. The rocks of a feldspathic nature being anterior in origin to the basaltic strata, which cap them, as well as to the basaltic streams of the coast-plains, accords with the usual order of succession of these two grand divisions of the volcanic series.|$|R
