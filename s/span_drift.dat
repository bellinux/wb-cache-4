40|$|Trace level {{detection}} of hydrazine (N 2 H 4), monomethyl hydrazine (MMH) and unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) has been receiving increased attention {{over the past}} several years. In May 1995 the American Conference of Government Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) lowered their acceptable threshold limit value (TLV) from 100 parts-per-billion (ppb) to 10 ppb. Several types of ppb-level detectors are being developed by the United States Air Force (USAF) Space and Missile Systems Center (SMSC). A breadboard version of a portable, lightweight hydrazine detection sensor was developed and produced by Giner Corp. for the USAF. This sensor was designed for ppb level UDMH and N 2 H 4 vapor detection in near real-time. This instrument employs electrochemical sensing, utilizing a three electrode cell with an anion-exchange polymer electrolyte membrane as the only electrolyte in the system. The sensing, counter and reference electrodes are bonded to the membrane forming a single component. The only liquid required to maintain the sensor is deionized water which hydrates the membrane. At the request of the USAF SMSC, independent testing and evaluation of the breadboard instrument was performed at NASA's Toxic Vapor Detection Laboratory (TVDL) for response to ppb-level N 2 H 4 and UDMH and MMH. The TVDL, located at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) has the unique ability to generate calibrated sample vapor streams of N 2 H 4, UDMH, and MMH over a range from less than 10 ppb to thousands of parts per million (ppm) with full environmental control of relative humidity (0 - 90 %) and temperature (0 - 50 C). The TVDL routinely performs these types of tests. Referenced sensors were subjected to extensive testing, including precision, linearity, response/recovery times, zero and <b>span</b> <b>drift,</b> humidity and temperature effects as well as ammonia interference. Results of these tests and general operation characteristics are reported...|$|E
40|$|The main {{function}} of the CO instrument is to provide continuous accurate measurements of carbon monoxide mixing ratio at the ARM SGP Central Facility (CF) 60 -meter tower (36. 607 °N, 97. 489 °W, 314 meters above sea level). The essential feature of the control and data acquisition system is to record signals from a Thermo Electron 48 C and periodically calibrate out zero and <b>span</b> <b>drifts</b> in the instrument using {{the combination of a}} CO scrubber and two concentrations of span gas (100 and 300 ppb CO in air). The system was deployed on May 25, 2005...|$|R
5000|$|The Yancopin Bridge was {{originally}} {{constructed by the}} Memphis, Helena & Louisiana Railway, a wholly owned subsidiary of the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway which was known colloquially as Iron Mountain. [...] The Iron Mountain itself became consolidated with the Missouri Pacific Railroad in 1881, but became fully merged later on in 1917. [...] The single-track bridge is an all-metal truss bridge, designed with one lift span and with lengthy wooden trestle approaches at both ends. The bridge was reportedly completed in 1903, but the track segment served by this bridge, between Watson and New Latour, was not opened for service until March 1, 1906. Floods periodically brought changes to the Arkansas River channel and necessitated numerous rebuilding projects for the bridge over the years, including {{the addition of a}} swing span sometime after World War II as the navigable channel under the lift <b>span</b> <b>drifted</b> shut. Articles in Missouri Pacific Lines Magazine describe this bridge as being perhaps the most expensive bridge on the entire Missouri Pacific system.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} some {{novel and}} hard-to-access data from Kalkoti, an Indo-Aryan language spoken in northern Pakistan. The particular {{focus is on}} showing how this Shina variety {{in a relatively short}} time <b>span</b> has <b>drifted</b> apart from its closest known genealogical relatives and undergone significant linguistic convergence with a Kohistani variety in whose vicinity Kalkoti is presently spoken. Among other features, we explore what seems like an ongoing process of tonogenesis as well as structural ?copying? in the realm of tense and aspect...|$|R
50|$|Unlike R/C racing where rubber or foam {{tires are}} {{constantly}} changed and have short life <b>spans,</b> R/C <b>drifting</b> {{can be done}} with tires made of ABS plastic piping. ABS piping can be purchased pre-cut from various R/C drifting companies or one can also fabricate one's own tires with ABS piping purchased from a plumbing or hardware store. For 1/10 scale R/C vehicles, 2 in ABS piping fits snug over the appropriate wheels for that scale vehicle. Drift tires can also be created out of white PVC piping due to the inherent frictionless behavior exhibited by PVC on concrete; however, the inherent white coloration of the material can be undesirable. Some users will paint these wheels to compensate.|$|R
30|$|Conventional PT gap opening systems utilize flat bearing ends. Fully bearing gap-opening devices tend {{to expand}} the frame beyond its {{original}} span length (Garlock et al. 2007); Dowden and Bruneau 2011). The uncontrolled <b>span</b> expansion induces <b>drift</b> concentration, additional column moments and tends to damage floor level diaphragms. In order to alleviate these effects, a truncated {{version of the same}} LB (Fig.  2 a, c) has been introduced. The proposed LB consists of a pin ended, steel wide flange beam that contains the PT cables. In order to avoid contact between the column and the truncated ends of the LB, the width of the initial gap should be larger than ϕ̅d/ 2.|$|R
40|$|Part 1 {{presents}} the results of a wind tunnel test of a biplane model with an 18 inch <b>span.</b> The lift, <b>drift,</b> and pitching moment were measured for a series of angles of incidence corresponding to the maximum possible changes of flight attitude. Only the discussion of symmetrical or longitudinal changes is given. From the observed rate of variation of the forces and pitching moment, it was possible to calculate the derivatives needed in the complete theory of longitudinal stability in still air. The damping of the pitching oscillation was also determined experimentally. Part 2 presents a theoretical method for determining the effects of gusts on aeroplanes in the following cases: (1) head-on gusts rising from 0 to j feet per second with various degrees of sharpness, (2) up gusts of the same type, (3) rotary gusts of the same type, (4) rear gusts and down gusts are included by merely changing the sign of j...|$|R
40|$|Treatment {{efficiency}} is drastically {{affected by the}} amount of spray drift away the target area. The present study investigates the effect of a reduced <b>span</b> on spray <b>drift</b> based on wind tunnel measurements with the final aim of guiding the design of a reduced span nozzle (Reduced span spray – Part 3 : Design of narrow span nozzle). A capillary jet with a free and a forced break up regimes, corresponding to 0. 5 and 0. 06 span values respectively, was tested under 2 m/s downwind speed. Droplets spots from the free break up regime show a bimodal distribution, which are related to droplets sizes: Bigger droplet travel less distance than smaller droplets. Droplet diameters measured on ground level at different distances from the generator were corroborated with the observed droplets spots. However, deposits from forced break up regime were similar to deposits obtained by the free break up regime, what may be due to emerged drops throughout the droplet stream. Much focus on the forced break up regime is needed to relate droplet size to spray drift. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{continental}} rise {{west of the}} Antarctic Peninsula includes a number of large sediment mounds interpreted as contourite drifts. Cores from six sediment <b>drifts</b> <b>spanning</b> some 650 km of the margin and 4 ° of latitude have been dated using chemical and isotopic tracers of palaeoproductivity and diatom biostratigraphy. Interglacial sedimentation rates range from 1. 1 to 4. 3 cm/ka. Glacial sedimentation rates range from 1. 8 to 13. 5 cm/ka, and decrease from proximal to distal sites on each drift. Late Quaternary sedimentation was cyclic, with brown, biogenic, burrowed mud containing ice-rafted debris (IRD) in interglacials and grey, barren, laminated mud in glacials. Foraminiferal intervals occur in interglacial stages 5 and 7 {{but not in the}} Holocene. Processes of terrigenous sediment supply during glacial stages differed; meltwater plumes were more important in stages 2 – 4, turbidity currents and ice-rafting in stage 6. The terrigenous component shows compositional changes along the margin, more marked in glacials. The major oxides Al 2 O 3 and K 2 O are higher in the southwest, and CaO and TiO 2 higher in the northeast. There is more smectite among the clay minerals in the northeast. Magnetic susceptibility varies along and between drifts. These changes reflect source variations along the margin. Interglacial sediments show less clear trends, and their IRD was derived from a wider area. Downslope processes were dominant in glacials, but alongslope processes may have attained equal importance in interglacials. The area contrasts with the East Antarctic continental slope in the SE Weddell Sea, where ice-rafting is the dominant process and where interglacial sedimentation rates are much higher than glacial. The differences in glacial setting and margin physiography can account for these contrasts...|$|R
