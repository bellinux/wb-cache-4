50|$|The Bündner Nusstorte (Graubünden nut pastry), {{also known}} as Engadiner Nusstorte, is a {{traditional}} sweet, caramelised nut-filled pastry (generally walnut) from canton Graubünden in Switzerland. The modern filled Nusstorte was first widely available in the 1960s though it was invented in the 1920s. While the Nusstorte is associated with Graubünden, the nuts are always imported because Graubünden's climate will not <b>support</b> <b>nut</b> trees.|$|E

2500|$|The line of General Purpose (GP) Acme threads (ASME/ANSI B1.5-1997) are not {{designed}} to sustain external radial loads and both the nut and bolt are, ideally, independently <b>supported,</b> the <b>nut</b> by a linear guide and the screw by shaft bearings. This {{is due to the}} need to avoid [...] "wedging" [...] of the thread flanks when subjected to radial loads, which would contribute substantially to friction forces and thread wear. However, there is a centralizing Acme-thread standard (also specified in ASME/ANSI B1.5-1997) which caters to applications where the threads are not radially supported, where the roots and crests of opposing threads are designed to come into contact before the flanks do, under radial loads. This adds the requirement that the sum of the allowances and tolerances on the major diameters of nut and bolt be less than the sum of the allowances on the pitch diameters (PD); the drawback is that, for a given amount of end play (axial clearance, due solely to PD deviations), closer tolerances and cleaner work environment are necessitated in the application of a centralizing Acme thread.|$|R

Millions {{of miles}} of pipeline are carrying fluent energy for our daily life, including water, natural gas, crude oil and nuclear materials. Micro in-pipe robot offers an effective technical method for pipe inspection and maintenance. A new bidirectional telescopic in-pipe robot was presented in this paper. In the first place, the whole structure of the in-pipe robot was described, illustrating its functions of motion principle and telescopic mechanisms, respectively. Then the inverting discipline and {{the driving force of}} mechanisms were analyzed in detail. The <b>supporting</b> lead screw <b>nut</b> was selected according to robot’s characteristic requirements, and its structural stability requirements were met after a series of verification. In the end, the buffer spring that satisfied with the restriction analysis was successfully designed...|$|R

40|$|Objective. To {{identify}} {{adherence to}} Mediterranean diet among {{two groups of}} Spanish adults: diabetic patients and nondiabetic subjects. Methods. Adherence to Mediterranean diet was measured by a 14 -item screener (scale: 0 – 14; ≤ 5 : low, 6 – 9 : moderate, and ≥ 10 : high) in 351 volunteers. Results. Mean age was 50. 97 [*]±[*] 12. 58 in nondiabetics (n= 154) and 59. 50 [*]±[*] 13. 34 in diabetics (n= 197). The whole sample scored 8. 77 [*]±[*] 1. 82. Score was 9. 19 [*]±[*] 1. 84 in nondiabetic females (n= 58) and 8. 15 [*]±[*] 1. 79 in diabetic females (n= 85) (p= 0. 003), due to lower consumption of olive oil (p= 0. 005) and nuts (p= 0. 000). Type 2 diabetic males (n= 79; 8. 76 [*]±[*] 1. 88) consumed less olive oil than healthy males (n= 28; 9. 36 [*]±[*] 1. 59) (p= 0. 046). Up to 30 -year-old nondiabetics scored lower than more than 60 -year-old nondiabetics (8. 40 [*]±[*] 1. 5 versus 9. 74 [*]±[*] 2. 03; p= 0. 047). The youngest ate less olive oil (p= 0. 002) and more pastries (p= 0. 007). Conclusions. The sample presented moderate adherence to Mediterranean diet in all subgroups. Scientific evidence {{about the benefits of}} Mediterranean diet, olive oil, and <b>nuts</b> <b>supports</b> the recommendation to increase consumption of olive oil and nuts in diabetic women and of daily olive oil in type 2 diabetic men, reducing consumption of red meat, butter, and pastries, and to promote Mediterranean diet among the youngest of the sample studied...|$|R
40|$|Times Cited: 22 Cited Reference Count: 56 International audienceIn a French {{population}} of Alpine marmots (Marmota marmota), the sex ratio at weaning was biased {{in favor of}} males. This bias also seemed to exist at birth. Under Fisher's equal allocation principle, this means that daughters should be more costly to produce than sons. Because the Alpine marmot {{can be considered a}} cooperative breeding species, we investigated whether the differential cost between sons and daughters may be explained by the helper repayment hypothesis. The Alpine marmot uses social thermoregulation during hibernation, allowing juveniles to better survive over winter. In the study population, juvenile survival during winter increased with group size. More precisely, juvenile survival during winter increased with the number and with the proportion of subordinate males in the hibernating group, but juvenile survival did not depend on the number of subordinate females. As our results did <b>nut</b> <b>support</b> alternative hypotheses to explain the observed bias in sex ratio among offspring at emergence, we conclude that the helper repayment hypothesis is the best candidate to explain the observed offspring sex ratio bias in Alpine marmots. By participating in social thermoregulation, subordinate males may repay part of the investment they received from their parents and thus become less costly to produce. We suggest that only subordinate males helped because they may gain direct fitness benefits, whereas subordinate females may only expect indirect fitness benefits from helping. Finally, the offspring sex ratio per individual parent was male biased, but mothers adjusted the size and the sex composition of their litters according to their phenotypic condition as expected from the Trivers-Willard hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{determine}} the personal effects of student assault upon a teacher and what assaulted teachers feel that they need in the way of support. In particular, I wanted the study to focus on the personal aspects of the cases as I was convinced that assaulted teachers experience similar anxieties, fears and barriers to support and similar difficulties in having those feelings recognised. Many clinical studies of assault victim support have been conducted, however, seemingly none of them are specifically related to assault by a student upon a teacher. This specific type of assault involves distinctive factors which effect the victim, such as the assailant being a minor and the victim an adult and the student being an inescapable part of the teacher 2 ̆ 7 s vocation. Given these aims, narrative form was considered the most appropriate methodology for the study. Narrative form uses emotive, context-specific language to build meaning, a plot based upon some form of conflict and the use of multiple voices. Thus the participants of the study became characters within the framework of an academic study. The idea that from the telling or reading of a story a type of truth can be developed is gradually becoming more accepted within the social sciences. This 2 ̆ 7 truth 2 ̆ 7 is created by the reader actively constructing knowledge from constant reflection on the experiences of the characters and then modifying these experiences within the story by using cultural knowledge as a basis for comparison (Gray, 1996, p 3). In this study three individual stories were collected during extensive interviews and were blended by the narrator (researcher) into a story of teacher assault that highlights the effects of workplace violence on the victims and their support needs. The story format allowed the portrayal of the assaulted teacher 2 ̆ 7 s perception and a brief insight into the frustrations experienced by members of the assaulted teacher 2 ̆ 7 s family. The study also developed a program of the types of support that should be provided for teachers when they have been assaulted by a student. The study revealed that the assaulted teachers experienced many similar anxieties, fears and barriers to support. The need for a specific support program for assaulted teachers was verified, as was the fact that <b>support</b> is currently <b>nut</b> being provided. Using information from the interviewed participants, a program of necessary support was formulated. A plan for schools to follow in order to establish effective support programs was also established...|$|R
