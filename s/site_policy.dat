This article provides a critical assessment of the ‘fair share’ criteria that are in use in Dutch <b>siting</b> <b>policies.</b> It brings to the surface the normative and political nature of these criteria that often remains implicit in such policies. The research shows that policy is dominated by discourse focusing on the potentially negative effects these facilities may have on surrounding neighbourhoods in terms of safety and security.

This is particularly true {{in the context of}} content production because copyright law represents a collection of complex policies that often do not always account for the ways that people use and re-use digital media. Within legal gray areas, people make decisions every day about what is allowed, often negotiating multiple sources of rules. How do content creators make decisions about what they can and cannot do when faced with unclear rules, and how does the law (and perceptions of the law) impact technology use, creativity, and online interaction?

The {{vision of}} {{having access to}} {{tremendous}} amounts of computation and storage resources on demand, together with access to special devices, similar to the availability of today’s power grids has been formulated by Ian Foster and Carl Kesselman in [1] in 1997 and since then has been known by the term Grid computing. As this vision slowly became reality and we’re now at the verge to having Grids production ready not only for scientific communities but also for industrial partners security, accounting and billing are now major concerns {{that need to be}} reflected and further improved. This paper analyzes two of the major local resource managers, Condor [2] and Torque[3], that are being used as local resource managers in the major grid middlewares Globus [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] {{as well as in the}} gLite and LCG [9, 10] software stack with respect of being able to track malicious jobs and enforce a <b>site</b> <b>policy.</b> As weaknesses have been found we also present an approach that is capable of truly tracking any kind of job. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Jakarta is {{the capital}} city of Indonesia which has {{problems}} of land subsidence with the rates of about 1 to 15 cm/year, up to 20 - 25 cm/year. The study has examined the land subsidence in Pantai Mutiara, Jakarta Bay which is a reclaimed area by using the Terrestrial LIDAR survey technique. The Terrestrial LIDAR survey results show that the survey site has mean elevation of 0. 24 m with the highest elevation of 0. 93 m and lowest- 0. 35 m. Considering that AHHW (approximate highest high water) is 0. 51 m, many areas of the survey site are lying below the AHHW. Pantai Mutiara area is showing various subsidence rates depending on sites although the site is relatively narrow and small (about 1 km 2). There is elevation differences of almost 1 m within the site. In this study, key information including topography, dike height distribution, and future coastal flooding risk of the survey area was able to be provided by Terrestrial LIDAR survey conducted only once. Especially, as the 3 D precision topography effectively conveys important messages relating to vulnerability of the <b>site,</b> <b>policy</b> makers and stakeholders can easily understand the situation of the site...|$|E
40|$|We examine {{experience}} accrued {{by those}} who have been involved with building large-scale Grids intended for production use. By this we mean that the primary task of such Grids is to enable largescale scientific research rather than to act as a test-bed for research into software development, or more speculative computer science. Severe constraints are brought to bear in the construction of such Grids, since access to such resources is subject to stringent requirements of security and high quality of service. We must also reckon {{with the fact that the}} resources on such Grids may not be primarily designed or tailored to Grid use. The Grid middleware cannot control policy on such Grids, it must co-operate with the <b>site</b> <b>policy</b> and resource management systems. We may be dealing with ancillary resources, such as telescopes and experimental facilities, that are not computational, may not possess a full operating system, and may have policy and management requirements that are very different from each other and from a computational node. Even within the domain of computational machines, we may encounter multiple architectures, clusters of workstations, specialist massively-parallel machines, clusters of shared-memory nodes, and machines with vector rather than scalar processors.

40|$|In {{the past}} five years, the number of Americans using the Internet as their main source of news has doubled to more than 40 %, while those {{choosing}} newspapers has dropped to just over 30 %. Although this trend signals {{a shift in the}} consumption of information in favor of hyper-media, wherein excerpting and linking is commonplace, research regarding how consumers acquire news in online environments has not proceeded apace. This dissertation presents a model of forward-looking consumers who gain knowledge and utility through the search and consumption of hyper-media, and explore its implications for welfare and <b>site</b> <b>policy.</b> The model is estimated using comScore browsing data for five celebrity news and gossip sites, supplemented with link data scraped from site archives. The model is estimated by coupling Imai, Jain, and Ching's (2009; Econometrica 77 (6) : 1865 - 1899) method with the Riemann manifold sampling algorithm of Girolami and Calderhead (2011; JRSS-B 73 (2) : 123 - 214). The pairing of these recent advances enables researchers to estimate dynamic models with many more variables and states than previously considered. Results indicate consumers are heterogeneous in their preferences for certain types of celebrity sites (e. g., females prefer sites that emphasize gossip over pictorials of female models and entertainers). Results also indicate that links to other sites are informative about the target site's potential quality; after observing one link to another site, consumers' uncertainty about the linked site's quality is about 20 % lower. Counterfactual analyses show that network throttling, in which access to all sites is slowed down uniformly in an effort to reduce congestion, has an unequal effect on site traffic. For example, sites frequented by consumers with higher than average browsing costs lose a greater share of their traffic. They also show how a change in fair use law, in which excerpts and links become less informative of the linked sites' quality, causes consumers with more extreme tastes to curtail their searches, consequently decreasing traffic at sites with mainstream content and many inbound links. A third counterfactual experiment uses the model to explore the implications of pay walls for site traffic. Dissertatio...|$|E

40|$|In high {{performance}} computing for scientific technologies, “grid” is watched withkeen interest, which constructs one compound computer system combining computationalresources over wide area network. Improving handiness is an importantissue in grid. Since computers (servers) in grid are heterogeneous {{in point of}} machinecomposition and each is administrated along with individual <b>site</b> <b>policy,</b> gridusers have to use servers while adapting to machine composition and administrationpolicy. In grid that consists of many servers, cost for the adaptive use is huge. Therefore, {{it is important to}} reduce such burdens for improving handiness of grid. In this paper, frameworks for reducing above-mentioned burdens are proposed. They focus on “deployment” and “execution” work for grid applications, whichstrongly need handiness for users. The two frameworks have the following features. (1) Relis-G: a framework for automatic library deployment Relis-G enables users to deploy a library to servers simultaneously andautomatically with fewer burdens than conventional manual method. Especially,it can deploy with very few burdens in frequent deployment likedebugging. In order to reduce user’s burdens for learning know-how about making alibrary portable, Relis-G provides users with library deployment systemthat automatically adds portability to a machine-dependent library. Relis-G provides users with library deployment system that deploys whileautomatically adapting to server’s administration policy (such as usagerule of secondary memory). (2) F-Omega: a framework for dynamic server change in grid applications In order to free users from complicated adaptation work to server statuschange, F-Omega enables grid applications to automatically changesservers appropriately that cooperate with server monitoring system. For automatic monitoring of server status change corresponding to complexserver use agreement like advanced reservation, which has been manuallymanaged by users and server administrators until now, F-Omegaprovides users with automatic monitoring system for server administrationschedule. To free application developers from complicated implementation workabout server management, F-Omega provides automatic server managementmodule for GridRPC applications. For verifying effectiveness of the proposed frameworks, each of them was implementedas middleware, and its application experiment was performed. Results of Relis-G application experiment in actual grid show that the middlewarereduces user’s burdens to deploy sample libraries. They also show that thelibrary portabilization function and the administration policy automatic adaptationfunction enable users to deploy without considering servers’ composition andadministration policy. In F-Omega application experiment, F-Omega middleware implementation is appliedto a sample grid application, and it is executed in experimental grid environment. While servers’ status changes per several hours, the application automaticallychanges its servers appropriately and runs successfully over 2. 8 days. As future works for Relis-G, I indicated need for development of on-demand automaticdeployment function for dynamically-specified servers. For F-Omega, I indicatedneed for interoperability in writing server administration schedule information. Contributions of this study are proposal of new approaches for reducing burdensthat come from large-scale and heterogeneous grid and verification of their effectivenessin realistic grid environment. Results of this study are significant in point ofindicating how grid user assistance tools should be. 電気通信大学 200...|$|E

Web <b>site</b> <b>policies</b> [...] and the overarching concept of web site governance [...] are cross-cutting concerns that have to be addressed and implemented at different levels (e. g., policy documents, legal statements, business processes, contracts, auditing, and software systems).
