The Multi-GAS consists of a non-dispersive infrared CO 2 -H 2 O analyzer (LI- 840, LI-COR, Inc., Lincoln, USA), SO 2 and H 2 S electrochemical sensors (KTS- 512 and KHS- 5 TA, respectively, Komyo Rikagaku K.K., Kawasaki, Japan), and an H 2 <b>semi-conductor</b> <b>sensor</b> (Model GM 12 s, Sensor Tech K.K., Rittou, Japan). Filter-type scrubbers for H 2 S and SO 2 were {{placed in front of}} the KTS- 512 and KHS- 5 TA sensors, respectively, to reduce cross-sensitivity of these sensors (Shinohara et al., 2011). The power was supplied by a small 12 V 1.5 Ah Lithium Ion Polymer battery, which can run the system for a few hours and the results are recorded every second by a data logger (NR- 1000, Keyence Co. Japan). The gases are pumped at a rate of 1 l/min from an air inlet {{at the front of the}} UAV into the Multi-GAS through Teflon tubing (Fig. 2).|$|E

40|$|The {{read-out}} {{from individual}} pixels on planar <b>semi-conductor</b> <b>sensors</b> are grouped into clusters {{to reconstruct the}} location where a charged particle passed through the sensor. The resolution given by individual pixel sizes is significantly improved by using {{the information from the}} charge sharing between pixels. Such analog cluster creation techniques have been used by the ATLAS experiment for many years to obtain an excellent performance. However, in dense environments, such as those inside high-energy jets, clusters have an increased probability of merging the charge deposited by multiple particles. Recently, a neural network based algorithm which estimates both the cluster position and whether a cluster should be split has been developed for the ATLAS Pixel Detector. The algorithm significantly reduces ambiguities in the assignment of pixel detector measurement to tracks within jets and improves the position accuracy with respect to standard interpolation techniques by taking into account the 2 -dimensional charge distribution. The implementation of the neural network, the training parameters and performance of the new clustering will be presented. Significant improvements of the track and vertex resolution obtained using this new method will be presented using Monte Carlo simulated data and compared to data recorded with the ATLAS detector will be given. The resulting improvements to both track reconstruction and the identification of jets containing b-quarks will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|For the Ariane vehicle system development, studies leaded {{to prevent}} fire and {{explosion}} risks mainly {{on account of}} hydrogen and oxygen on board of the launcher: the leckage detection (0 2, H 2) {{was one of the}} studies axis. This activity concerned the detection systems of H 2 and/or O 2 in terms of operational needs for a launcher: measure principle, instrumentation used in industry or in Research/Development, performances and reliability. Hydrogen detection is possible with various physical or chemical technics. The choice of the method depends on the performances which are inquire for a special application: on one hand, the measurement performances (sensitivity, selectivity, stability, reproducibility, calibration needs, [...] .) and on the other hand, the operational parameters such as cost, dimensions, weight, power supply, [...] . An evaluation of these detection systems (catalyst detector, thermal conductivity, electrochemical oxidation, optical interferometry, thin film detector, [...] .) based on Nasa data [1] showed the interest of the semi-conductor sensors: nevertheless an accurate evaluation of these sensors performance is essential to consider their possible utilization for Ariane 5. Also, a research activity, beared by the CNES (the French Space Agency: Ariane Launcher Direction) and managed by the AEROSPATIALE (Industrial Architect of Ariane 5) was leaded by Saint-Etienne Mines School.

40|$|Electronic {{nose and}} {{olfactometry}} techniques represent a modern analytical approach in food industry since they could potentially improve quality {{and safety of}} food processing. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate possible application of electronic nose in PA P detection and recognition in feed. For this purpose 6 reference feedstuffs (CRA-W / UE STRAT F E E D Project) were used. The basis of the test samples was a compound feed for bovine fortified with processed animal proteins (PAP) consisting of meat and bone meal (MBM) and/or fish meal at different concentrations. Each feed sample was tested in glass vials and the odour profile was determined by the ten MOS (metal oxide <b>semi-conductor)</b> <b>sensors</b> of the electronic nose. Ten different descriptors, representing each ten sensors of electronic nose, were used to characterise the odour of each sample. In the present study, electronic nose was able to discriminate the blank sample from all other samples containing PA P (M B M, fish meal or both). Samples containing either 0. 5 % of MBM or 5 % of fish meal were identified, while samples containing a high fish meal content (5 %) associated with a low MBM content (0. 5 %) were not discriminated from samples containing solely fish meal at that same high level (5 %). This latter indicates that probably the high fish meal level, in samples containing both MBM and fish meal, tended to mask MBM odour. It was also evident that two odour descriptors were enough to explain 72. 12 % of total variability in odour pattern. In view of these results, it could be suggested that electronic nose and olfactometry techniques can provide an interesting approach for screening raw materials in feed industry, even though further studies using a wider set of samples are needed...|$|R
40|$|A linear feature {{extraction}} technique for asymmetric distributions is introduced, the asymmetric class projection (ACP). By asymmetric clas-si cation is understood discrimination among distributions with dierent covariance matrices. Two distributions with unequal covariance matrices do not in general have a symmetry plane, {{a fact that}} makes the analysis more dicult compared to the symmetric case. The ACP is similar to linear discriminant analysis (LDA) in the respect that both aim at ex-tracting discriminating features (linear combinations or projections) from many variables. However, the drawback of the well known LDA is the assumption of symmetric classes with separated centroids. The ACP, in contrast, works on (two) possibly concentric distributions with unequal covariance matrices. The ACP is tested on data from an array of <b>semi-conductor</b> gas <b>sensors</b> {{with the purpose of}} distinguish bad grain from good. RCS Revision: 2 : 12...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The data {{collected}} from electronic nose systems are multidimensional and usually contain a lot of redundant information. In order to extract only the relevant data, different computational techniques are developed. The article presents and compares selected pattern recognition algorithms in application to qualitative determination of different brands of tea. The measured responses of an array of 18 <b>semi-conductor</b> gas <b>sensors</b> formed input vectors used for further analysis. The initial data processing consisted on standardization, principal component analysis, data normalization and reduction. Soft computing one can divide into single method systems using neural networks, fuzzy systems, and hybrid systems like evolutionary-neural, neuro-fuzzy, evolutionary-fuzzy. All the presented systems were evaluated based on accuracy (generated error) and complexity (number of parameters and training time) criteria.

40|$|S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: We {{report the}} {{behavior}} of Au nanoparticles anchored onto a Si(111) substrate {{and the evolution of}} the combined structure with annealing and oxidation. Au nanoparticles, formed by annealing a Au film, appear to “float ” upon a growing layer of SiO 2 during oxidation at high temperature, yet they also tend to become partially encapsulated by the growing silica layers. It is proposed that this occurs largely because of the differential growth rates of the silica layer on the silicon substrate between the particles and below the particles due to limited access of oxygen to the latter. This in turn is due to a combination of blockage of oxygen adsorption by the Au and limited oxygen diffusion under the gold. We think that such behavior is likely to be seen for other metal− semiconductor systems. Thin layers and nanoparticles of metals on semiconductor or oxide surfaces are of great importance in catalysis, <b>semi-conductor</b> fabrication, <b>sensors,</b> and even in anticancer therapie...|$|R

Complementary metal-oxide <b>semi-conductor</b> (CMOS) <b>sensors,</b> for example, havemade the digital camera a commonplace con-sumer item. These light-sensitive chips, positioned where film would normally be, capture images as reusable digital files that users can upload to their computer, manipulate with software, and distrib-ute electronically. Recent technological advances are enabling {{a new generation of}} smart cameras that represent a quan-tum leap in sophistication. While today’s digital cameras capture images, smart cameras capture high-level descriptions of the scene and analyze what they see. These devices could support a wide variety of applications including human and ani-mal detection, surveillance, motion analysis, and facial identification. Video processing has an insatiable demand for real-time performance. Fortunately, Moore’s law provides an increasing pool of available computing power to apply to real-time analysis.

Moving well beyond pixel processing and compression, these systems run a wide range of algorithms to extract meaning from streaming video.

This paper mainly concentrated on controlling the air pollution from vehicles by using <b>semi-conductor</b> gas <b>sensor</b> for detecting the emission level from vehicles. If the vehicle do not get service regularly, then pollution level higher than standard emission level. In this paper, smoke sensor {{has been used to}} detect carbon monoxide from vehicles. Smoke sensor senses the pollution level from vehicles. If pollution level is recorded beyond the standard values from government, then microcontroller alerts the buzzer and displays pollution level on LCD. Microcontroller also sends pollution level to service centre through text message by GSM module. At the same time, activate the timer that indicates vehicle will be stopped after some time. During this time, GPS finds the location of vehicle in terms of latitude and longitude values and displays on LCD. GSM send GPS values to service centre through text message. When timer expires, vehicle will be stopped due to the fuel supply to engine get stop by relay circuit is controlled by microcontroller. Based on GPS values, service centre can trace and service the vehicle. The proposed system must be registered with service centre by sending text message.

The silicone tube diameter, silicone tube length and helium flow rate (as the carrier gas were considered as process parameters to be optimized. A continuous stream of helium (50 mL/min) was directed through the tubing, sweeping out the dissolved methane which diffused {{through the walls}} of the tubing from the fermentation broth.

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} novel, mechanically tunable sensor that utilizes the acoustic response of a polymer based acoustic bandgap (ABG) material {{to identify and}} quantify damage in material substrates. Acoustic bandgap (ABG) sensors are the mechanical analogues of semi-conductors by which a periodic array of differing acoustic impedances causes an acoustic bandgap. This {{is comparable to the}} periodic array of electronic potentials that cause an electronic bandgap in <b>semi-conductors.</b> An ABG <b>sensor</b> is composed of a host matrix material with a periodic array of inclusions/scatterers made of a material with dissimilar acoustic impedance. ABG sensors offer advantages to structural health monitoring (SHM) applications. Such advantages include sensor scalability which enables macro to sub-micron damage detection and the non-intrusive attachment of the sensor to substrates. The specific use of ABG sensors is proposed for areas of known damage already initiated (hot-spots) in critical components of a structure. This thesis examines the proposed use of ABG materials as sensors by showing experimentally and analytically how ABG can be used to detect and quantify change in the strain field of the substrate underneath. A parametric experimental study examines specimens composed of two host materials of low and medium elasticity, one viscoelastic and one elastic respectively. Four volume fractions are also considered for both host material types. A finite element simulation is employed to verify the experimental observations of the acoustic bandgap sensors and to demonstrate the functionality of the sensor.
