40|$|This {{framework}} for socio-economic analysis presents procedures and information specifications {{that can be}} used to conduct <b>socio-economic</b> <b>assessments</b> in support of Canada-wide standards development. While the generic questions raised in the framework should be considered during the development of standards, it may not be possible or necessary to carry out each step or procedure in detail. Rather, the framework is intended as a guide and a checklist to help practitioners develop an analytical program appropriate to their individual needs and circumstances. As the process to develop Canada-wide standards evolves, so too will the use of this framework. PURPOSE The intent of this Framework is to describe the procedures and information requirements for socioeconomic assessments of potential or proposed environmental standards. Standards may be ambient quality concentrations or maximum allowable emission or discharge limits. The advantages that socio-economic analyses bring to standard setting will be noted and criteria for deciding when <b>socio-economic</b> <b>assessments</b> should be applied to setting specific standards will be listed. This Framework is derived from procedures employed by the Ontario Ministry of the Environment and Energy in developing and evaluating environmental protection policies and from guidelines and recommendations provided in a consultantÕs report that was commissioned by the Economic Integration Task Group of the CCME (Sustainable Futures, 1997).

30|$|For various reasons, the {{quantification}} of {{the costs}} of impacts on nature and the environment represents a considerable challenge. First, the methodology for monetary assessment of environmental impacts is still in its early stages. This is not surprising, because it involves fundamental questions that cannot be answered objectively (e.g., “What is the value of a partridge?”). Second, a suitable database is often lacking for the assessment of environmental costs. This is the case in particular for the description or quantification of the specific/relative contributions of chemical plant protection to adverse impacts or general trends observable in the environment, e.g., effects on water organisms of pollution with both PPP residues and nutrients. Currently, the data and analyses needed for a rational and fact-based discussion are not available. The only comprehensive, independent cost–benefit analysis for Germany was commissioned in 1991 by the Agriculture Ministry [67]. This study still has a model character, because no analyses of comparable scope have since been carried out in Germany. Meanwhile, however, conventions and proposals regarding the criteria for <b>socio-economic</b> <b>assessments</b> of environmental impacts have been developed, e.g., at the international level [68] and also by UBA [69].|$|R

Paper No. 551 This paper highlights the dynamics between land use changes in the Kolleru Ramsar wetland and local livelihood systems and explains these through the lense of national policy responses and international (Ramsar) obligations. A multi-disciplinary approach was adopted by integrating geospatial tools and techniques with policy and livelihoods analysis. The findings show a temporal transfer of policy motives underpinning key land use changes, from agriculture supporting local livelihoods (up to the late 1970 's) to maximizing economic values of land through commercial aquaculture (1980 's- 1999), and finally to ecological restoration and protection (1999 onwards). Each land use change brought new challenges at the local scale. <b>Socio-economic</b> <b>assessments</b> revealed that the demolition of aquaculture ponds (2006) prompted changes in livelihood strategies. Some households diversified their livelihoods (e. g. fishing)), while compensation packages helped this diversification in some instances.

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} how biophysical and <b>socio-economic</b> <b>assessments</b> of adaptation options {{can be integrated}} to test the effectiveness of options and anticipate social risks and potential barriers to adoption.

Our results show that strategies to manage stocking rates and pasture spelling {{are likely to be}} effective in improving climate resilience in the rangelands and are easy-to-implement, short-term solutions. Improving land condition is found to have the greatest potential long-term benefits, but was not considered by the graziers to be feasible or effective due to perceived difficulties of implementation. Areas of concordance identified in the assessments may be used to engage with stakeholders and build a foundation for incorporating climate change considerations into management and policy. The approach also highlights discordant views within the assessments that may result from differing management objectives, adaptive capacity and climate-risk perception. These factors are potential impediments to adaptation. The integrated assessment approach enables adaptation strategies and policy recommendations to be developed that have greater relevance to individual stakeholders, and supports capacity building to facilitate the most effective adaptation actions...|$|R

40|$|In {{the future}} the {{cultivation}} of GM crops in the EU may increase, which can {{have a number of}} socio-economic consequences for farmers, upstream and downstream industries as well as consumers. The European GMO Socio-Economics Bureau (ESEB) has compiled topics, indicators, methodological guidelines and potential data sources to carry out analyses of these socio-economic effects. This document provides a framework applicable to any GM crop that has been or might be grown in EU Member States. Almost 100 indicators, which range from farm adoption rates to consumer surplus, have been identified by the ESEB Technical Working Group composed of representatives of Member States and with assistance from the European Commission's Joint Research Centre. Evidence of impacts in the EU already exists for some crop/trait combinations both ex post and ex ante but for most topics it is very limited. Methodologies have been developed by the scientific community for many of the topics and indicators (from simple partial budget analysis to complex aggregated models).

This report is {{available}} at [URL] deliverable provides further advice on the methodology for <b>socio-economic</b> <b>assessment</b> of ICT based systems, within the Field Operational Tests (FOTs) being part-funded by the European Commission. It can {{be treated as a}} supplement to Chapter 9 of the FESTA Handbook. Use of a consistent methodology in the FOTs will maximise the comparability of the results across regions, ICT systems and individual FOTs. The goal of this deliverable is therefore to provide concise advice on how to carry out a socio-economic impact assessment, addressing issues likely to arise and giving references to more detailed guidance elsewhere, plus examples of good practice in existing (web) documents. Topics covered by this document include: • the assessment framework; • the approach to specific stakeholders as part of the wider picture; • scope of the assessment - which impacts should be included; • analysis methods for specific impacts; • financial analysis; • data needs. Data {{will be one of the}} keys to success for the FOTs. This deliverable provides advice on which data will need to be collected during the FOT itself, i. e. 'FOT-specific data' (with implications for the design of FOTs), as well as generic data needed to carry out a <b>socio-economic</b> <b>assessment.</b> The latter include values for accident and casualty reduction. This advice will be useful for: clients commissioning FOTs; consortia drawing up proposals for FOTs; and organisations carrying-out FOTs. It is assumed that a specialist in the area of socioeconomic impact assessment will carry out the analysis - so a full "tutorial" on <b>socio-economic</b> <b>assessment</b> is neither feasible nor necessary in this deliverable. We will refer to this specialist as the “analyst”. The advice was prepared by a group of European experts in the area of stand-alone and cooperative vehicle ICT systems and socio-economic impact assessment.

40|$|Socio-economic {{monitoring}} {{plans are}} designed to facilitate issues tracking and management regarding the intended and unintended impacts and benefits of major projects. They also provide a feedback mechanism to the socio-economic assessor and proponent, which can introduce greater certainty to future <b>socio-economic</b> <b>assessments</b> and inform proponent initiatives on future projects. The aim {{of this paper was}} to identify the extent to which socio-economic monitoring is utilized in Canadian pipeline projects, identify lessons that can be learned from socio-economic monitoring in other resource extraction industries and geographies, as well as make recommendations on the application of socio-economic monitoring for the Canadian pipeline industry. The current Canadian legislative framework was reviewed for socio-economic monitoring requirements. Other Canadian industries, North American and international examples were also examined to provide context on best and emerging practices related to socio-economic monitoring. This paper also examines whether recent major pipeline projects have proposed and/or implemented socio-economic monitoring plans. This paper finds that, while socio-economic monitoring is utilized to some extent within the mining industry, there is limited known application within the Canadian pipeline industry. Lessons and strategies that {{can be applied to the}} Canadian pipeline industry and regulators are discussed. Ultimately, this paper argues that the diverse nature of the Canadian socio-economic landscape and the linear nature of pipelining support the need for socio-economic monitoring plans that will track and respond to the varied interests of stakeholders and the dynamic nature of socio-economic outcomes. Socio-economic monitoring can be an important tool for managing non-technical risk...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The Neusiedler See is {{situated}} at the lowest point of the Small Hungarian Plain, in a basin without outlet, at about 113 metres above sea level and with a surface area of about 320 km 2. East of the lake extends the Seewinkel plain with an area of about 450 km 2. For the National Park the meadowlands, created through use for traditional haymaking, the remaining pastureland and the unique, frequently evaporating saltwater pans with their varying salinity levels are areas of particular interest. In the 20 th century the water management in the Seewinkel (artificial draining, over-exploitation of groundwater) caused severe damage to the natural hydrological cycle and the aquatic ecosystems, and from 1900 to nowadays the water surface area was reduced by 75 %. In the future, the environment Seewinkel needs to be managed in landscape units, based on integrative hydrological, physico-chemical, biological and <b>socio-economic</b> <b>assessments.</b> One aspect could be the renaturalization of parts of this landscape. Potential wetlands in the National Park Neusiedler See-Seewinkel/Fertö-Hansag can be detected by the aid of different sources.
