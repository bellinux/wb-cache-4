50|$|Persea borbonia is {{a species}} of plant in the Lauraceae family, with several common names {{including}} redbay, tisswood, scrubbay, shorebay, and <b>swampbay.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Mill Creek - 20 acres (81,000 m²) {{of mature}} beech-{{magnolia}} woodland. All five species of magnolia {{in the state}} are found here, as are beech, southern magnolia, <b>swampbay,</b> spruce pine, and yellow-poplar.|$|E
50|$|The plant {{grows in}} moist soils in {{several types of}} habitat, such as {{floodplains}} and hammocks, and near swamps and waterways. Associates include Atlantic white cypress (Chamaecyparis thyoides), Florida hobblebush (Agarista populifolia), common palmetto (Sabal palmetto), bush palmetto (Sabal minor), needle palm (Rhapidophyllum hystrix), sweetbay (Magnolia virginiana), and <b>swampbay</b> (Persea palustris).|$|E
50|$|This is a plant of the Florida scrub. It {{grows in}} bare {{stretches}} of white sand, including {{gaps in the}} rosemary and sand pine scrub and in blowouts. The land is dry and the bare, sunny gaps in the scrub are maintained by periodic wildfire. Other plants in the habitat include <b>swampbay</b> (Persea palustris), scrub palmetto (Sabal etonia), eastern prickly pear (Opuntia humifusa), and several species of oak.|$|E
50|$|Magnolia virginiana, most {{commonly}} known as sweetbay magnolia, or merely sweetbay (also laurel magnolia, <b>swampbay,</b> swamp magnolia, whitebay, or beaver tree), {{is a member of}} the magnolia family, Magnoliaceae. It was the first magnolia to be scientifically described under modern rules of botanical nomenclature, and is the type species of the genus Magnolia; as Magnolia is also the type genus of all flowering plants (magnoliophytes), this species in a sense typifies all flowering plants.|$|E
50|$|Persea palustris is {{a species}} of plant in the Lauraceae family.It belongs to the {{evergreen}} trees genus Persea of about 150 species.Commonly known as the <b>swampbay,</b> is a tree native to eastern North America, from Texas eastwards to Florida and then extending north to Delaware, mostly on the Gulf Coastal Plain and Atlantic Coastal Plain but extending into the Piedmont somewhat. Its range also includes the Bahamas. It was previously considered a subspecies of the redbay P. borbonia.|$|E
50|$|The host {{plants of}} the spicebush {{swallowtail}} are most commonly either spicebush (Lindera benzoin) or white sassafras (Sassafras albidum). Other possible host plants include prickly ash (Zanthoxylum), {{as well as}} tulip tree (Liriodendron tulipfera), sweetbay (Magnolia virginiana), camphor (Cinnamomum camphora) and redbay (Persea borbonia). Redbay and <b>swampbay</b> are the primary host plants {{for members of the}} P. t. ilioneus strain, while spicebush and sassafras as the primary hosts for P. t. troilus. However, when given the choice between spicebush and sassafras, the P. t. troilus showed no significant preference for either.|$|E
50|$|This herb {{grows in}} a number of plant {{communities}} on the coastal plains of southern North Carolina and northern South Carolina, including pocosins, sandhills, pine flatwoods and pine savannas. It is most commonly found in open areas in the ecotone between longleaf pine uplands and pond pine pocosins. The soil is seasonally wet to waterlogged or submerged, low in nutrients, rich in peat over sandy substrates. The plant is found in sections of these habitat types which, in their pristine state, are openings in a dense layer of shrubs which are kept open by severe periodic wildfires. Fire prevents ecological succession, maintaining a type of ecosystem in which the taller vegetation is kept small and sparse, allowing the herb layer to flourish in the sun. Trees, shrubs, and ferns in the area include Aronia arbutifolia (chokeberry), Clethra alnifolia (summersweet), Cyrilla racemiflora (titi), Fothergilla gardenii (dwarf fothergilla), Ilex glabra (Appalachian tea), Magnolia virginiana (sweetbay), Osmunda cinnamomea (cinnamon fern), Persea palustris (<b>swampbay),</b> Symplocos tinctoria (yellowwood), and Vaccinium species (wild blueberries). Herbs, grasses, and mosses associated with this ecosystem include Andropogon glomeratus (bushy bluestem), Aristida stricta (wiregrass), Drosera intermedia (oblong-leaved sundew), Drosera capillaris (pink sundew), Lachnanthes caroliniana (redroot), Peltandra sagittifolia (spoon flower), Sarracenia flava (yellow pitcher plant), and Sphagnum species (sphagnum mosses).|$|E
40|$|The {{invasive}} redbay ambrosia beetle, Xyleborus glabratus, is {{the primary}} vector of Raffaelea lauricola, a symbiotic fungus and the etiologic agent of laurel wilt. This lethal disease has caused severe mortality of redbay (Persea borbonia) and <b>swampbay</b> (P. palustris) trees in the southeastern USA, threatens avocado (P. americana) production in Florida, and has potential to impact additional New World species. To date, all North American hosts of X. glabratus and suscepts of laurel wilt {{are members of the}} family Lauraceae. This comparative study combined field tests and laboratory bioassays to evaluate attraction and boring preferences of female X. glabratus using freshly-cut bolts from nine species of Lauraceae: avocado (one cultivar of each botanical race), redbay, <b>swampbay,</b> silkbay (Persea humilis), California bay laurel (Umbellularia californica), sassafras (Sassafras albidum), northern spicebush (Lindera benzoin), camphor tree (Cinnamomum camphora), and lancewood (Nectandra coriacea). In addition, volatile collections and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) were conducted to quantify terpenoid emissions from test bolts, and electroantennography (EAG) was performed to measur...|$|E
40|$|Laurel wilt is a {{destructive}} vascular disease responsible for high mortality of American tree {{species in the}} family Lau raceae, particularly redbay (Persea borbonia) and <b>swampbay</b> (P. palustris), two dominant components of Coastal Plain forest communities in the southeastern United States. The disease syndrome emerged {{as a result of}} establishment of an exotic wood-boring beetle, Xyleborus glabratus, now known as the redbay ambrosia beetle. During gallery excavation, females of X. glabratus introduce a newly-described, obligatory fungal symbiont, Raffaelea lauricola. This fungus proliferates within the gallery and provides food for the beetles, but it has proven to be pathogenic to American lauraceous hosts, which have had no co-evolved history with R. lauricola. Presence of the foreign fungus elicits secretion of resins and formation of extensive parenchymal tyloses within xylem vessels. The extreme defensive response results in blockage of water transport, systemic wilt, and ultimately tree death. The beetle vector was first detected near Savannah, Georgia in 2002, and since has spread throughout the Southeast to become established in six states. The epidemic spread south through Florida more rapidly than predicted and currently threatens commercial production of avocado (Persea americana). Recent research indicates that California bay laurel (Umbellularia californica) can serve as a re productive host for X. glabratus and is susceptible to laurel wilt disease. Thus, the US Pacific coastal forest ecosys tems (and the California avocado industry) would be negatively impacted should the vector become established along the western coast. This review article summarizes our current understanding of the insect vector, the mycopathogen, and the susceptible host tree species. It also addresses elements of disease management and limitations with our current de tection methods for redbay ambrosia beetle, which rely on manuka oil lures. Of the host-based attractants evaluated, cubeb oil shows the most promise as a potential new lure for X. glabratus.   </p...|$|E
