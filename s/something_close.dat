A separate score was written by Werner Heymann in Germany, also in 1927. In pace with Brownlow's efforts to restore the movie to <b>something</b> <b>close</b> to its 1927 incarnation, two scores were prepared in 1979–1980; one by Carl Davis in the UK and one by Carmine Coppola in the US.|$|E
25|$|In another short, Little Beau Pepé, Pepé, {{attempting}} {{to find the}} most arousing cologne with which to impress Penelope, sprays a combination of perfumes and colognes upon himself. This resulted in <b>something</b> <b>close</b> to a love-potion, leading Penelope to fall madly in love with Pepé in an explosion of hearts. Pepé is revealed to be extremely frightened of overly-affectionate women ("But Madame!"), much to his dismay, as Penelope quickly captures him and smothers him in more love than even he could imagine.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{a fairly}} solid start to his {{international}} career, Shah could not produce the required consistency of form, making {{just one more}} fifty in ten innings from 2001/02 to 2002/03. He also suffered from a perception that his fielding was below par, <b>something</b> <b>close</b> to unforgivable in the modern one-day game, and he was dropped from the England side without having had a chance at Test cricket. In 2004, a year of success with the bat (1,336 runs at 53.44) was tempered {{by the loss of}} his Middlesex captaincy in mid-season after some poor results.|$|E

A highlight that year came when Statham took five wickets in the first-ever Gillette Cup match against Leicestershire.|$|E
25|$|The {{external}} {{form of the}} Accounts underwent several changes during the century, in its size, format and layout. In only twenty years, from <b>something</b> <b>close</b> to a broadside they became a small pamphlet, indicating both consolidation as a specific genre and the permission given by the City Officials. They were published {{at the price of}} 2 or 3 pence as folio broadsheets until 1712, when they were expanded to six folio pages. During the 1720s the type size was reduced and a third column was added. By 1734 they comprised sixteen or twenty-eight quarto pages and they were sold for 4 or 6 pence.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolution}} of mammals has passed through many stages {{since the first}} appearance of their synapsid ancestors in the late Carboniferous period. The most ancestral forms in the class Mammalia are the egg-laying mammals in the subclass Prototheria. This class first started out as <b>something</b> <b>close</b> to the platypus and evolved to modern day mammals. By the mid-Triassic, there were many synapsid species that looked like mammals. The lineage leading to today's mammals split up in the Jurassic; synapsids from this period include Dryolestes, {{more closely related to}} extant placentals and marsupials than to monotremes, as well as Ambondro, more closely related to monotremes. Later on, the eutherian and metatherian lineages separated; the metatherians are the animals more closely related to the marsupials, while the eutherians are those more closely related to the placentals. Since Juramaia, the earliest known eutherian, lived 160 million years ago in the Jurassic, this divergence must have occurred in the same period.|$|E

500|$|George Harrison's stated aim for his North American {{tour with}} Indian {{musician}} Ravi Shankar, {{which took place}} from 2 November to 20 December 1974, was to offer concert-goers [...] "another kind of experience" [...] from the typical mid-1970s rock show. With its blending of Western rock, funk and jazz genres with Indian classical music, author Robert Rodriguez describes the result as a musical form [...] " [...] one day would be called 'world music'". Of the critical reception given to the Harrison–Shankar venture, tour-wide, Rodriguez writes of the [...] "genuine highlights that went mostly unreported", since: [...] "Smaller press outlets without axes to grind tended to review the shows the best, whereas rock establishment coverage, such as Rolling Stones, tended to spin the tour as <b>something</b> <b>close</b> to an unmitigated disaster ..." ...|$|E

He did think that a jambonneau of duck was worth praising, describing it as [...] "delicious", but also thought that another dish of monkfish was rubbery in texture. He described the menu itself as [...] "awkwardly written, badly punctuated, and at points quite impenetrable". Following the first Michelin star, David Fingleton visited {{the restaurant}} for The Spectator, and said that the experience was [...] "beyond reproach; unsullied pleasure from start to finish".|$|E

500|$|Robby Benson as Beast [...] – A young prince who is {{transformed}} into a beast by an enchantress as punishment for his arrogance. The animators drew him with the head structure and horns of an American bison, the arms and body of a bear, the ears of a deer, the eyebrows of a gorilla, the jaws, teeth, and mane of a lion, the tusks of a wild boar, and the legs and tail of a wolf. Chris Sanders, one of the film's storyboard artists, drafted the designs for the Beast and came up with designs based on birds, insects, and fish before coming up with <b>something</b> <b>close</b> to the final design. Glen Keane, supervising animator for the Beast, refined the design by going to the zoo and studying the animals on which the Beast was based. Benson commented, [...] "There's a rage and torment in this character I've never been asked to use before." [...] The filmmakers commented that [...] "everybody was big fee-fi-fo-fum and gravelly" [...] while Benson's voice had the [...] "big voice and the warm, accessible side" [...] and that [...] "you could hear the prince beneath the fur".|$|E
500|$|Austen began {{a second}} novel, First Impressions (later {{published}} as Pride and Prejudice), in 1796. She completed the initial draft in August 1797, aged 21; {{as with all}} of her novels, Austen read the work aloud to her family as {{she was working on}} it and it became an [...] "established favourite". At this time, her father made the first attempt to publish one of her novels. In November 1797, George Austen wrote to Thomas Cadell, an established publisher in London, to ask if he would consider publishing First Impressions. Cadell returned Mr. Austen's letter, marking it [...] "Declined by Return of Post". Austen may not have known of her father's efforts. Following the completion of First Impressions, Austen returned to Elinor and Marianne and from November 1797 until mid-1798, revised it heavily; she eliminated the epistolary format in favour of third-person narration and produced <b>something</b> <b>close</b> to Sense and Sensibility. In 1797, Austen met her cousin (and future sister-in-law), Eliza de Feullide, a French aristocrat whose first husband the Comte de Feullide had been guillotined, causing her to flee to Britain, where she married Henry Austen. The description of the execution of the Comte de Feullide related by his widow left Austen with an intense horror of the French Revolution that lasted {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E
500|$|Character {{designs were}} cooperatively handled by Kunihiko Tanaka and Kouichi Mugitani, while mecha designs were handled by Mugitani and Junya Ishigaki. Mugitani also {{worked on the}} game as {{production}} designer. The art director was Yasuyuki Honne, who had previously worked on both Xenogears and Chrono Cross, while character motion was handled by Norihiro Takami. Honne collaborated with Takami in creating the character motions for cutscenes. When creating the designs, Tanaka was given an outline of a character by Takahashi in addition to comparisons with real-life actors, and then created the designs from that. Tanaka's art style—which gave characters large eyes dominating their faces—provided a challenge for the team as Takahashi wanted to be {{as close to the}} original artwork as possible, but the expressive power of the large-eyed facial design could easily be [...] "destroyed" [...] by the wrong lighting. Takami worked hard on character models to make sure the large eye styling was preserved without upsetting the model's balance. Mugitani and Ishigaki respectively handled the designs for Vector staff and the Federation. KOS-MOS was initially designed by Tanaka, but he had considerable trouble finalizing her design. Mugitani then contributed, creating <b>something</b> <b>close</b> to KOS-MOS's final design, which was then polished by Tanaka. Tanaka also had difficulty creating Shion's design, giving her glasses as an easy way of showing her personality.|$|E

500|$|Burgess shale type {{preservation}} {{is defined}} as the fossilization of non-biomineralized organisms as flattened carbonaceous films in marine shales. When the animals started to decompose, their tissues collapsed {{under the weight of the}} sediment that buried them. The typical flattened fossils are outlines of tougher parts such as cuticles and jaws, which resisted decomposition for long enough to be fossilized. Soft elements, such as muscles and gut contents, were sometimes squeezed out of the decomposing organism to produce dark stains on the fossils. Organisms that lack tougher structures, such as flatworms, nemerteans and shell-less molluscs, were not preserved by this process. Very soft but chemically active tissues may be preserved by different processes. For instance during decomposition, bacteria modify the chemically unusual mid-gut glands of some organisms into the durable mineral phosphate. This change happens extremely quickly, before the corpse is compressed, and leaves a three-dimensional mold of the tissues. Gills can also be preserved in <b>something</b> <b>close</b> to their original three-dimensional shape by this process. Both preservation mechanisms can appear in the same fossil. In Burgess-like shales, organisms and parts that are only quite soft, such as muscles, are generally lost, while those that are extremely soft and those that are fairly tough are preserved. The preservation of different body parts in different ways may sometimes help palaeontologists, by suggesting whether a body part was fairly tough like an arthropod limb (preserved as flat film) or very soft and chemically active, like a part of the gut (preserved as a solid piece of mineral). These differences may also help to identify fossils, by excluding from consideration organisms whose body parts do not match the combination of types of preservation found in a particular fossil bed.|$|E

This was explored in his 1953 novel Childhood's End and briefly touched upon in his novel Imperial Earth. This idea of transcendence through evolution seems to have been influenced by Olaf Stapledon, who wrote a number of books dealing with this theme.

Their thesis, while controversial, has gained significant acceptance.
