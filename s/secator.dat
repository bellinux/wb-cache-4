40|$|The {{research}} was conducted during 2010 - 2012 on pellic vertisol soil type. Factor A included no treated check and 2 stimulators – Napsil – 500 ml ha- 1 and Cemofol – 700 ml ha- 1. Factor B included weeded no treated check and 4 antibroadleaved herbicides – Derby super WG – 33 g ha- 1, <b>Secator</b> OD – 100 ml ha- 1, Sunsac – 1 l ha- 1, Lintur 70 WG – 150 g ha- 1. All of stimulators, antibroadleaved herbicides and their tank mixtures were treated in tillering stage of the durum wheat. Under investigation was Bulgarian durum wheat cultivar Victoria, which belongs to Triticum durum var. valenciae Desf. The grain yield was the highest by combined use of stimulators Napsil and Cemofol with herbicides Derby super and <b>Secator.</b> Stimulator Cemofol cannot be mixed with herbicide Lintur. There is antagonism at mixtures of stimulator Napsil with herbicides Lintur and Sansak. The lowest durum wheat grain yields are obtained by these tank mixtures. The grain yield decrease by these tank mixtures {{is due to the}} decrease in the grain number per spike and the grain weight spike. The 1000 grain weight, test weight and vitreousness are increased by influence of the investigated stimulators, antibroadleaved herbicides and their tank mixtures. Stimulators Napsil and Cemofol and antibroadleaved herbicides Derby super, <b>Secator,</b> Sunsac and Lintur increase the protein quantity, wet and dry gluten quantities. Protein quantity, wet and dry gluten quantities are the highest by the tank mixtures Napsil + Derby super and Napsil + <b>Secator...</b>|$|E
