25|$|Post-accident {{investigation}} by the NTSB showed that {{the leading cause of}} the accident was Denver's inability to switch fuel tanks during flight. The quantity of fuel had been depleted during the plane's transfer to Monterey and in several brief practice takeoffs and landings Denver performed at the airport immediately prior to the final flight. His newly purchased experimental Rutan had an unusual fuel <b>selector</b> <b>valve</b> handle configuration. Intended by the plane's designer to be located between the pilot's legs, the builder instead had placed the fuel selector behind the pilot's left shoulder, with the fuel gauge also behind the pilot's seat and not visible to the person at the controls. An NTSB interview with the aircraft mechanic servicing Denver's plane revealed that he and Denver had discussed the inaccessibility of the cockpit fuel <b>selector</b> <b>valve</b> handle and its resistance to being turned.|$|R

40|$|A {{system has}} been {{developed}} and qualified as flight hardware for the measurement of micturition volumes voided by crewmen during Gemini missions. This Chemical Urine Volume Measurement System (CUVMS) is used for obtaining samples of each micturition for post-flight volume determination and laboratory analysis for chemical constituents of physiological interest. The system is versatile with respect to volumes measured, with a capacity beyond the largest micturition expected to be encountered, and with respect to mission duration of inherently indefinite length. The urine sample {{is used for the}} measurement of total micturition volume by a tracer dilution technique, in which a fixed, predetermined amount of tritiated water is introduced and mixed into the voided urine, and the resulting concentration of the tracer in the sample is determined with a liquid scintillation spectrometer. The tracer employed does not interfere with the analysis for the chemical constituents of the urine. The CUVMS hardware consists of a four-way <b>selector</b> <b>valve</b> in which an automatically operated tracer metering pump is incorporated, a collection/mixing bag, and tracer storage accumulators. The assembled system interfaces with a urine receiver at the <b>selector</b> <b>valve</b> inlet, sample bags which connect {{to the side of the}} <b>selector</b> <b>valve,</b> and a flexible hose which carries the excess urine to the overboard drain connection.

40|$|Abstract- Newly {{developed}} turbocharger Swing <b>valve</b> <b>assembly</b> (arm and bush) has to {{be tested}} to study the product life cycle and to know the satisfactory working throughout entire duty cycle. The turbine housing consists of swing <b>valve</b> <b>assembly</b> used to bypass the exhaust gas directly to atmosphere whenever not required. This assembly consists of two types of fits. Interference fit between turbine housing and bush and clearance fit between bush and arm. But, it is expensive and requires more time to carry out experimental study and measurements can be made only at {{the limited number of}} time stations. So, Finite element method is considered as a standard approach which is economical avoiding frequent experimental studies to find the performance of turbochargers. This paper deals with structural analysis of turbocharger’s swing <b>valve</b> <b>assembly</b> where von misses stress distributions are plotted for both minimum and maximum interference cases due to thermal loads acting b/w bush and turbine housing.

50|$|Fuel is piped through {{fuel lines}} to a fuel control valve (usually {{known as the}} fuel <b>selector).</b> This <b>valve</b> serves several {{function}}s. The first function is {{to act as a}} fuel shut-off valve. This is required to provide the crew with a means to prevent fuel reaching the engine in case of an engine fire. The second function is to allow the pilot to choose which tank feeds the engine. Many aircraft have the left tank and right tank selections available to the pilot. Some Cessna airplanes feed only from both tanks; and many have the option to feed from left, right, or both tanks. The reason to have left only and right only options is to allow pilots to balance fuel load to reduce the banking moment. In some aircraft, the shut-off function is a different valve located after the fuel <b>selector</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|R
