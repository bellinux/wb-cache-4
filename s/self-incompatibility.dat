5|$|Allogamy (outcrossing) on {{the whole}} is {{enforced}} through a late-acting (ovarian) <b>self-incompatibility</b> system, but some species such as N. dubius and N. longispathus are self-compatible producing mixtures of selfed and outcrossed seeds.|$|E
5|$|Some species, {{such as the}} Uruguayan Hippeastrum petiolatum, are sterile {{and unable}} to produce seeds. H. petiolatum is a sterile {{triploid}} that reproduces asexually, producing many bulbils around the mother bulb. These are light, and easily carried {{on the surface of}} water ensuring distribution of the species during the rainy season. Other species such as Hippeastrum reticulatum are self-pollinating, reproducing by distributing seed. Although this does not guarantee genetic diversity in natural populations, it is widely used by colonising species. These two examples are not however typical of the genus, which commonly reproduces through allogamy. One mechanism that limits self-pollination is that of <b>self-incompatibility</b> by which seeds are only produced by pollination from other plants. Furthermore, the plant generally releases its pollen about two days before its stigma is receptive, making cross-pollination more likely. Pollinators include Humming birds in subtropical areas, and moths.|$|E
5|$|Species {{boundaries}} in plants may be weaker than in animals, and cross species hybrids are often possible. A familiar example is peppermint, Mentha × piperita, a sterile hybrid between Mentha aquatica and spearmint, Mentha spicata. The many cultivated varieties of wheat {{are the result}} of multiple inter- and intra-specific crosses between wild species and their hybrids. Angiosperms with monoecious flowers often have <b>self-incompatibility</b> mechanisms that operate between the pollen and stigma so that the pollen either fails to reach the stigma or fails to germinate and produce male gametes. This is one of several methods used by plants to promote outcrossing. In many land plants the male and female gametes are produced by separate individuals. These species are said to be dioecious when referring to vascular plant sporophytes and dioicous when referring to bryophyte gametophytes.|$|E
25|$|A {{distinct}} SI mechanism {{exists in}} heterostylous flowers, termed heteromorphic <b>self-incompatibility.</b> This mechanism {{is probably not}} evolutionarily related to the more familiar mechanisms, which are differentially defined as homomorphic <b>self-incompatibility.</b>|$|E
25|$|Late-acting <b>self-incompatibility</b> (LSI) is also termed ovarian <b>self-incompatibility</b> (OSI). In this mechanism, self pollen germinates {{and reaches}} the ovules, but no fruit is set. LSI can be pre-zygotic (e.g. {{deterioration}} of the embryo sac prior to pollen tube entry, as in Narcissus triandrus) or post-zygotic (malformation of the zygote or embryo, as in certain species of Asclepias and in Spathodea campanulata).|$|E
25|$|<b>Self-incompatibility</b> (SI) is {{a general}} name for several genetic {{mechanisms}} in angiosperms, which prevent self-fertilization and thus encourage outcrossing and allogamy. It {{should not be confused}} with genetically controlled physical or temporal mechanisms that prevent self-pollination, such as heterostyly and sequential hermaphroditism (dichogamy).|$|E
25|$|In gametophytic <b>self-incompatibility</b> (GSI), the SI {{phenotype}} of {{the pollen}} {{is determined by}} its own gametophytic haploid genotype. This is the more common type of SI. Two different mechanisms of GSI have been described in detail at the molecular level, and their description follows.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a botanical genetic {{polymorphism}} is heterostyly, in which flowers occur in different forms with different arrangements of the pistils and the stamens. The system is called heteromorphic <b>self-incompatibility,</b> and the general 'strategy' of stamens separated from pistils is known as herkogamy.|$|E
25|$|The grass {{subfamily}} Pooideae, {{and perhaps}} {{all of the}} family Poaceae, have a gametophytic <b>self-incompatibility</b> system that involves two unlinked loci referred to as S and Z. If the alleles expressed at these two loci in the pollen grain both match the corresponding alleles in the pistil, the pollen grain will be recognized as incompatible.|$|E
25|$|During pollination, plants enforce <b>self-incompatibility</b> (SI) as an {{important}} means to prevent self-fertilization. Research on the corn poppy (Papaver rhoeas) has revealed that proteins in the pistil on which the pollen lands, interact with pollen and trigger PCD in incompatible (i.e., self) pollen. The researchers, Steven G. Thomas and Veronica E. Franklin-Tong, {{also found that the}} response involves rapid inhibition of pollen-tube growth, followed by PCD.|$|E
25|$|In sporophytic <b>self-incompatibility</b> (SSI), the SI {{phenotype}} of {{the pollen}} {{is determined by}} the diploid genotype of the anther (the sporophyte) in which it was created. This form of SI was identified in the families: Brassicaceae, Asteraceae, Convolvulaceae, Betulaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Sterculiaceae and Polemoniaceae. Up to this day, only one mechanism of SSI has been described in detail at the molecular level, in Brassica (Brassicaceae).|$|E
25|$|Since most plants carry {{both male}} and female {{reproductive}} organs in their flowers, there is a high risk of self-pollination and thus inbreeding. Some plants use the control of pollen germination as a way to prevent this self-pollination. Germination and growth of the pollen tube involve molecular signaling between stigma and pollen. In <b>self-incompatibility</b> in plants, the stigma of certain plants can molecularly recognize pollen from the same plant and prevent it from germinating.|$|E
25|$|The {{relevance}} of DHs to plant breeding has increased markedly {{in recent years}} owing {{to the development of}} protocols for 25 species. Doubled haploidy already {{plays an important role in}} hybrid cultivar production of vegetables, and the potential for ornamental production is being vigorously examined. DHs are also being developed in the medicinal herb Valeriana officinalis to select lines with high pharmacological activity. Another interesting development is that fertile homozygous DH lines can be produced in species that have <b>self-incompatibility</b> systems.|$|E
25|$|Cryptic <b>self-incompatibility</b> (CSI) {{exists in}} {{a limited number of}} taxa (for example, there is {{evidence}} for CSI in Silene vulgaris, Caryophyllaceae). In this mechanism, the simultaneous presence of cross and self pollen on the same stigma, results in higher seed set from cross pollen, relative to self pollen. However, as opposed to 'complete' or 'absolute' SI, in CSI, self-pollination without the presence of competing cross pollen, results in successive fertilization and seed set; in this way, reproduction is assured, {{even in the absence of}} cross-pollination. CSI acts, at least in some species, at the stage of pollen tube elongation, and leads to faster elongation of cross pollen tubes, relative to self pollen tubes. The cellular and molecular mechanisms of CSI have not been described.|$|E
500|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority of scleractinian taxa are hermaphroditic in their adult colonies. [...] In temperate regions, the usual pattern is synchronized release of eggs and sperm into the water during brief spawning events, often related to the phases of the moon. In tropical regions, reproduction may occur throughout the year. In many cases, as in the genus Acropora, the eggs and sperm are released in buoyant bundles which rise to the surface. This increases the concentration of sperm and eggs and thus the likelihood of fertilization, and {{reduces the risk of}} self-fertilization. [...] Immediately after spawning, the eggs are delayed in their capability for fertilization until after the release of polar bodies. [...] This delay, and possibly some degree of <b>self-incompatibility,</b> likely increases the chance of cross-fertilization. [...] A study of four species of Scleractinia found that cross-fertilization was actually the dominant mating pattern, although three of the species were also capable of self-fertilization to varying extents.|$|E

5000|$|Ciona intestinalis is a {{hermaphrodite}} that releases {{sperm and}} eggs {{into the surrounding}} seawater almost simultaneously.

50|$|Since hermaphrodites can {{reproduce}} {{on their}} own, they {{are referred to}} as being self-compatible. On the contrary, non-hermaphroditic plants are self-incompatible. Research has shown that a species can be either gynodioecious or self-incompatible, but very rarely is there a co-occurrence between the two. Therefore, gynodioecy and <b>self-incompatibility</b> tend to prevent each other’s maintenance. <b>Self-incompatibility</b> of plants helps maintain androdioecy in plants, since males are in competition with only hermaphrodites to sire ovules. <b>Self-incompatibility</b> leads to a loss in gynodioecy, since neither hermaphrodites nor females have to deal with inbreeding depression.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{possibility}} is that the high outcrossing rate is due to <b>self-incompatibility,</b> due either to a failure to fertilise or abortion of self-fertilised fruit. Studies have shown self-compatibility of pollen to vary between Banksia species, with some but not all species inhibiting the growth of pollen tubes for pollen from its own flowers. A more likely form of <b>self-incompatibility</b> is the spontaneous abortion of fruits that have been self-fertilised. These could be caused either by the expression of lethal genes, or the expression of genes that, while not lethal, cause the maternal plant to abort. Genetic causes {{are thought to be}} a common form of <b>self-incompatibility,</b> because of the high genetic load of the genus.

5000|$|Heterostyly is {{a unique}} form of {{polymorphism}} and herkogamy in flowers.
