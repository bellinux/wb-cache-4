5000|$|Contamination control {{products}} {{have been used}} by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the commercial nuclear industry for decades to minimize contamination on radioactive equipment and surfaces and fix contamination in place. “Contamination control products” is a broad term that includes fixatives, strippable coatings, and decontamination gels. A fixative product functions as a permanent coating to stabilize residual loose/transferable radioactive contamination by fixing it in place; this aids in preventing the spread of contamination and reduces the possibility of the contamination becoming airborne, reducing workforce exposure and facilitating future deactivation and decommissioning (D&D) activities. <b>Strippable</b> <b>coating</b> products are loosely adhered paint-like films and are used for their decontamination abilities. They are applied to surfaces with loose/transferable radioactive contamination and then, once dried, are peeled off, which removes the loose/transferable contamination along with the product. The residual radioactive contamination on the surface is significantly reduced once the <b>strippable</b> <b>coating</b> is removed. Modern strippable coatings show high decontamination efficiency and can rival traditional mechanical and chemical decontamination methods. Decontamination gels work {{in much the same way}} as other strippable coatings. The results obtained through the use of contamination control products is variable and depends on the type of substrate, the selected contamination control product, the contaminants, and the environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.).https://www.dndkm.org/DOEKMDocuments/library/Contamination%20Control%20Fixatives%20List.pdf ...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of strippable coatings is an innovative technology for decontamination of nuclear plants and for any decontamination project aiming at removing surface contamination. An adhesive plastic coating is applied on the contaminated surface. The <b>strippable</b> <b>coating</b> {{is allowed to}} cure for up to 24 h, after which it can be easily peeled. The coating traps the contaminants in the polymer matrix. Strippable coatings are non-toxic and do not contain volatile compounds or heavy metals. Since the coating constitutes a solid waste, disposal is easier than treating contaminated liquid wastes, produced by the baseline technology: steam vacuum cleaning, based upon superheated pressurized water in order to remove contaminants from floors and walls. A life cycle assessment (LCA) {{has been carried out}} with the purpose of comparing the <b>strippable</b> <b>coating</b> with the steam vacuum technology. The functional unit of the study is represented by a surface of 1 m(2) to be decontaminated. The results of LCA achieved using Sima Pro 5. 0 (A (R)) software confirm the good environmental performances of strippable coatings. Taking into account both LCA and environmental costs for liquid wastes, the advantages of strippable coatings will be more and more evident...|$|E
40|$|The extreme {{ultraviolet}} (EUV) {{is becoming increasingly}} important. Principal applications include orbital space-based astronomy and lithography for integrated circuit computer chips. A main impediment to further development of efficient mirrors {{is the lack of}} reliable optical constants for various materials in this region of the electromagnetic spectrum. One reason for the unreliability of the optical constants is that the sample surfaces are often contaminated with foreign material, especially organic compounds, when exposed to laboratory air. Several cleaning techniques were evaluated, namely: 1) strippable solid optical cleaner (Opticlean®); 2) oxygen plasma etch; 3) high energy UV light/ozone; 4) <b>strippable</b> <b>coating</b> followed by oxygen plasma etch, 5) <b>strippable</b> <b>coating</b> fol-lowed by high intensity UV light and, 6) exposure to cold pressurized carbon dioxide (CO 2 snow). These processes are compared experimentally based on effectiveness, cleaning time and ease of use. DADMAC (polydiallyldimethyl-ammo-nium chloride), which forms a layer of known, uniform thickness on silicon wafers is used as a “stand in ” for organic contamination. Effectiveness is judged on how well the sur-face is cleaned. Ellipsometry is used to determine the thick-nesses of surface layers. XPS (X-ray Photoelectron Spectros-copy) is used to look for trace contaminants, particularly carbon from the DADMAC. We find that the strippable cleaning coat leaves a residue. Oxygen plasma rapidly re-moves contaminants, but can quickly oxidize the silicon surface. Exposure to the UV light/ozone for five minutes leaves the surface clean with little additional oxidation. Oxy-gen plasma or UV light effectively removes the strippable coat residue. Exposure to cold pressurized carbon dioxide has reduced oxide level in one case. The recommended procedure for cleaning bare silicon wafers is strippable coat application followed by 2. 5 minutes of exposure to high intensity UV light...|$|E
40|$|Strippable or {{temporary}} coatings are innovative {{technologies for}} decontamination that effectively reduce loose contamination at low cost. These coatings {{have become a}} viable option during the deactivation and decommissioning of both US Department of Energy (DOE) and commercial nuclear facilities to remove or fix loose contamination on both vertical and horizontal surfaces. The ALARA{trademark} 1146 <b>strippable</b> <b>coating</b> was demonstrated {{as part of the}} Savannah River Site LSDDP and successfully removed transferable (surface) contamination from multiple surfaces (metal and concrete) with an average decontamination factor for alpha contamination of 6. 68 and an average percentage of alpha contamination removed of 85. 0 %. Beta contamination removed was an average DF of 5. 55 and an average percentage removed of 82. 0 %. This paper is an Innovative Technology Summary Report designed to provide potential users with the information they need to quickly determine if a technology would apply to a particular environmental management problem. They also are designed for readers who may recommend that a technology be considered by prospective users. This Innovative Technology offers a 35 % cost savings over the Baseline Technology...|$|E
40|$|Strippable or {{temporary}} coatings {{were developed}} {{to assist in the}} decontamination of the Three Mile Island (TMI- 2) reactor. These coatings have become a viable option during the decontamination and decommissioning (D and D) of both US Department of Energy (DOE) and commercial nuclear facilities to remove or fix loose contamination on both vertical and horizontal surfaces. A variety of strippable coatings are available to D and D professionals. However, these products exhibit a wide range of performance criteria and uses. The Hemispheric Center for Environmental Technology (HCET) at Florida International University (FIU) was commissioned to perform a 2 -year investigation into strippable coatings. This investigation was divided into four parts: (1) identification of commercially available <b>strippable</b> <b>coating</b> products; (2) survey of D and D professionals to determine current uses of these coatings and performance criteria; (3) design and implementation of a non-radiological testing program to evaluate the physical properties of these coatings; and (4) design and implementation of a radiological testing program to determine decontamination factors and effects of exposure to ionizing radiation. Activities during fiscal year 1997 are described...|$|E
40|$|Strippable {{coatings}} are polymer mixtures, such as water-based organic polymers, {{that are}} applied to a surface by paintbrush, roller, or spray applicator. As the polymer reacts, it attracts, absorbs, and chemically binds the contaminants; then, during the curing process, it mechanically locks the contaminants into the polymer matrix. Incorporating fiber reinforcement (such as a cotton scrim) into the coating may enhance the strength of these coatings. Once the coating dries, it can be stripped manually from the surface, In the case of auto-release coatings, the mixture cracks, flakes, and is collected by vacuuming. The surface properties of these coatings may be modified by applying a thin top coat (e. g., polyvinyl alcohol), which may provide a smoother, less permeable surface that would become less severely contaminated. In such a duplex, the thicker basis layer provides the required mechanical properties (e. g., strength and abrasion resistance), while the top layer provides protection from contamination. Once the <b>strippable</b> <b>coating</b> is removed, the loose surface contamination is removed with the coating, producing a dry, hard, non-airborne waste product. The use of strippable coatings during D&D operations has proved a viable option. These coatings {{can be used in}} the following three functions: As a protective coating, when applied to an uncontaminated surface in an area where contamination is present, so that on its removal the surface remains uncontaminated; As a decontamination agent, when applied to a contaminated surface, so that on its removal a significant decontamination of loose particulate activity is achieved; and As a fixative or tie-down coating, when applied to a contaminated surface, so that any loose contamination is tied down, thus preventing the spread of contamination during subsequent handling...|$|E
40|$|The microcontamination {{of optical}} {{surfaces}} or optical thin films affects {{many of their}} properties. In this work, we investigated several measurement systems to detect many types of surface contamination of coatings based on the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) phenomenon. The attenuated total reflection (ATR) coupling, {{also known as the}} Kretschmann configuration, excited the nonradiative surface plasmon wave for SPR measurement. Several microcontamination layers thinner than 10 nm were studied. The results showed that in all the cases SPR curves shifted to larger incident angles. From the amount of angle shift, the thickness of contamination was determined with a sensitivity of as little as one angstrom. The optical constants of those contamination layers were also derived. The shifts of the SPR curves served as an index for the efficiency of cleaning processes. It was found that the contamination by moisture can be removed with Iso-propyl alcohol by the ultrasonic cleaning process, while acetone was the more effective solvent in removing the contamination left by <b>strippable</b> <b>coating</b> residue show that the contamination layer was roughened by ultrasonic cleaning. In studies of island-like discontinuous thin layers of Ag, Al, and MgF₂, we found that the refractive index of MgF₂, a dielectric film material, slightly decreased as the thickness decreased, but for discontinuous metal films, the optical constants changed rapidly and became more dielectric in nature. Direct detection of contamination by coating processes in a small vacuum chamber was also carried out. In a chamber with high backstreaming from a diffusion pump, a broad SPR curve for an Ag film revealed obvious optical constant changes. Measuring and comparing the shift indicates that a significant amount of contamination was occurring right after the coating was completed. This suggests that for good evaporated optical thin films, {{it is important to have}} a more tightly controlled evaporation process. Finally, particulate, as well as layered, contamination can also be measured. A radiative SPR wave was generated by illuminating a contaminated surface. Similar radiative SPR waves also can be observed by adding a rough contaminant layer on an Ag film...|$|E
40|$|Radiological {{decontamination}} of surfaces is challenging. Cleanup {{tasks are}} typically visual or even chemically measured, but radioactive contamination is invisible and measured at extremely low levels. Different contamination events have {{lead to the}} development of hundreds of decontamination processes. Their selection balances criteria such as cost effectiveness and waste minimization. While testing on the actual system where the contaminations arises (as "field" radioactive specimens) is appropriate, doing so is expensive and time consuming. Simulating contamination with substitute contaminants requires a unique understanding of the system. This provides a less expensive, more controlled and often more informative selection method. However, not all simulation methods are reliable, reproducible, have a useful range nor are relevant to the target activity. To address these needs, a range of simulated contamination systems have been developed: ·SIMCON 1 – to simulate loose contamination on stainless steel; ·SIMCON 2 – to simulate fixed contamination on oxide coated stainless steel; ·A radiological dispersal device (RDD) or so-called “dirty bomb” contaminant to simulate fixed contamination on urban material surfaces. Over 400 individual decontamination tests have been performed with these simulants, using a range of contaminants (Cs, Zr, Am, Sr, Co) and substrates (steel, concrete, marble, limestone, granite). Review and data mining of the results of these tests has allowed for the development of an understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of interaction between contamination and surface and their role in determining decontamination efficiency. Detailed analysis of the SIMCON results demonstrates that the availability of a deliberately designed contamination simulant system allows for the comparative assessment {{of a wide range of}} decontamination methods in a common frame of reference on a “level playing field”. Though somewhat intuitively obvious, the SIMCON methods evaluation unambiguously demonstrated that chemically different contaminants may behave quite differently during a decontamination action. The exact nature of this behavior depends upon the nature of applications (loose or fixed) and the decontamination method itself. If a wide range of decontamination methods are deployed on a well-designed contamination simulant, comparison of the results of the decontamination tests may provide insight into the mechanism of contamination e. g. how it is held (loose, fixed etc.), where it is held (on the surface, in a protective oxide layer etc.) and so forth. These conclusions are reinforced by detailed consideration of the urban RDD simulant decontamination data. With respect to the contaminants themselves, it is found that cations that exhibit a pH dependent speciation, such as americium or cobalt, can demonstrate radionuclide / material substrate specific chemistry that results in contaminant precipitation at the substrate surface, especially if the material has an intrinsically alkaline surface pH. For example, in the case of Am and Co, this results in the precipitation of Am and Co oxyhydroxide species at the outer surface of materials such as concrete with consequently high percentage removal efficiencies. For cationic radionuclides such as Cs+ that do not exhibit any nuclide/material surface specific chemistry the principal material property controlling the tenacity of that nuclide during decontamination from urban material substrates is the permeability of that substrate. For substrates of similar permeability, net surface negative charge on the material substrate plays a major role in determining the tenacity of non-reactive cations such as cesium; the larger the net negative charge on the substrate surface, the more tenacious the contamination. Finally, with respect to the decontamination agents themselves, harsh, high concentration chemical agents that utilize multiple decontamination processes (acids, bases, chelants) typically have an effectiveness advantage over more dilute, one component solutions. Strongly acidic solutions achieve the highest overall % removal decontamination results. This is partly because they tend to dissolve small amounts of the substrate surface and liberate imbibed contaminants. Finally, some <b>strippable</b> <b>coating</b> based methods are found to be surprisingly effective; likely because of their chelant/absorbtive character...|$|E
40|$|This {{report was}} {{prepared}} to document the physical, chemical and radiological properties of plutonium oxide materials that were processed in the Plutonium Fuel Form Facility (PuFF) in building 235 -F at the Savannah River Plant (now known as the Savannah River Site) in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s. An understanding of these properties is needed to support current project planning for the safe and effective decontamination and deactivation (D&D) of PuFF. The PuFF mission was production of heat sources to power Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) used in space craft. The specification for the PuO{sub 2 } used to fabricate the heat sources required that the isotopic content of the plutonium be 83 {+-} 1 % Pu- 238 due to its high decay heat of 0. 57 W/g. The high specific activity of Pu- 238 (17. 1 Ci/g) due to alpha decay makes this material very difficult to manage. The production process produced micron-sized particles which proved difficult to contain during operations, creating personnel contamination concerns and resulting in the expenditure of significant resources to decontaminate spaces after loss of material containment. This report examines high {sup 238 }Pu-content material properties relevant to the D&D of PuFF. These relevant properties are those {{that contribute to the}} mobility of the material. Physical properties which produce or maintain small particle size work to increase particle mobility. Early workers with {sup 238 }PuO{sub 2 } felt that, unlike most small particles, Pu- 238 oxide particles would not naturally agglomerate to form larger, less mobile particles. It was thought that the heat generated by the particles would prevent water molecules from binding to the particle surface. Particles covered with bound water tend to agglomerate more easily. However, it is now understood that the self-heating effect is not sufficient to prevent adsorption of water on particle surfaces and thus would not prevent agglomeration of particles. Operational experience at PuFF indicates that the Pu- 238 contamination was observed to move along surfaces and through High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters over time. Recent research into the phenomenon known as alpha recoil offers a potential explanation for this observed behavior. Momentum is conserved when an alpha particle is ejected from a Pu- 238 atom due to radioactive decay. Consequently, the entire particle of which that Pu- 238 atom is a constituent experiences a movement similar to the recoil of a gun when a bullet is ejected. Furthermore, the particle often fractures in response to Pu- 238 atom disintegration (yielding an alpha particle), with a small particle fragment also being ejected in order to conserve momentum. This process results in the continuous size reduction and transport of particles containing Pu- 238 atoms, thus explaining movement of contamination along surfaces and through HEPA filters. A better understanding of the thermal behavior of {sup 238 }PuO{sub 2 } particles is needed to inform the planning process for the PuFF D&D project at the 235 -F facility. There has been a concern that the surface temperature of individual particles may be high enough to cause problems with decontamination equipment and materials as a result of heat generation due to radioactive decay. A calculation under conservative assumptions shows that the surface temperature of particles less than about 100 {micro}m diameter is not appreciably above ambient. Since most particles in PuFF are on order of 1 {micro}m in diameter, the effect of particle surface temperature on decontamination equipment and materials is expected to be minimal. The result of this calculation also indicates that thermal imaging, which has been under consideration as a method to monitor the progress of system decontamination efforts would not likely be effective. The use of <b>strippable</b> <b>coating</b> was suggested as a possible alternative to other decontamination techniques. One particular system (i. e., Decon Gel 1101) may offer significant advantages over conventional liquid decontamination solutions. Previous trials are discussed and have been used successfully at SRS on various surfaces. Some areas showed minimal improvement, while others presented complete (100 %) decontamination. However, small scale testing is recommended prior to the full scale use in the cells of PuFF in building 235 -F...|$|E
