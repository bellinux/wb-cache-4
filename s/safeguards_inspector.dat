40|$|The Rokkasho Spent Fuel Receipt and Storage (RSFS) Facility at the Rokkasho Reprocessing Plant (RRP) in Japan is {{expected}} to begin operations in 1998. Effective safeguarding by International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Japan Atomic Energy Bureau (JAEB) inspectors requires monitoring the time of transfer, direction of movement, and number of spent fuel assemblies transferred. At peak throughput, up to 1, 000 spent fuel assemblies will be accepted by the facility in a 90 -day period. In order for the <b>safeguards</b> <b>inspector</b> to efficiently review the resulting large amounts of inspection information, an unattended monitoring system was developed that integrates containment and surveillance (C/S) video with radiation monitors. This allows for an integrated review of the facility`s radiation data, C/S video, and operator declaration data. This paper presents an outline of the integrated unattended monitoring hardware and associated data reviewing software. The hardware consists of a multicamera optical surveillance (MOS) system radiation monitoring gamma-ray and neutron detector (GRAND) electronics, and an intelligent local operating network (ILON). The ILON was used for time synchronization and MOS video triggers. The new software consists of a suite of tools, each one specific to a single data type: radiation data, surveillance video, and operator declarations. Each tool {{can be used in a}} stand-alone mode as a separate ion application or configured to communicate and match time-synchronized data with any of the other tools. A data summary and comparison application (Integrated Review System [IRS]) coordinates the use of all of the data-specific review tools under a single-user interface.

While the United States has maintained {{a high level of}} support for the Agency over the duration of its history, the number of American inspectors currently in the field does not reflect this level of involvement. As a result, the National Nuclear Security Administration’s Office of International Relations, as part of the Next Generation Safeguards Initiative (NGSI) mission, has tasked Idaho National Laboratory (INL) to develop a rigorous two week hands-on training program to encourage and operationally acclimatize U. S. Citizens who are interested in applying for IAEA inspector positions using IAEA authorized equipment at INL. Idaho National Laboratory is one-of-a-kind in its ability to train IAEA inspectors by including training at nuclear facilities on site and includes, for example, direct measurement of an active spent fuel storage cooling pond. This accredited course will introduce and train attendees on the major IAEA systems used in collecting nuclear safeguards data and performing safeguards inspections. Unique in the United States, these classes will give attendees direct hands-on training and will address equipment purpose, function, operating principles, application, and troubleshooting, based upon what would be expected of an IAEA <b>Safeguards</b> <b>Inspector</b> in the field and in the office. Upon completion, U. S. applicants will be better qualified to pursue a position in the IAEA Department of Safeguards Operational Divisions. In support, INL has recently established a new laboratory space to house state of the art nuclear safeguards instrumentation. Currently, equipment installed in the laboratory space includes attended systems: 3 DLR (3 -D Imaging Laser) for design information verification, a Digital Cerenkov Viewing Device for measurement of spent fuel, HM- 5 handheld radiation detectors, quantitative neutron and gamma systems; unattended monitoring systems including: NGAM and MiniGRAND radiation systems and a DMOS camera system, and VACOSS/EOSS Optical Sealing Systems. ...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} of Virtual Reality ¿ VR ¿ {{is creating a}} computer-based experience normally by means of realistically simulated environments and associated interactions. A realistic, three-dimensional, interactive, real-time computer graphics model is key to 'cheating' someone's sensory perception system and make an individual feel inside, i. e., immersed, into the environment being simulated. Some simulators go beyond the visual experience and include other sensory information devices. Special devices provide {{the interaction between the}} individual and the environment. This interaction is normally tuned for specific application areas or fields of work. For some years the European Commission's Joint Research Centre has done R&D work on the application of VR based techniques to Nuclear Safeguards and Security. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe two VR based demonstrators. The first demonstrator aims at easing the design and planning for the installation of containment and surveillance devices at a nuclear site under Safeguards. In practice, this means choosing the appropriate equipment (e. g., surveillance cameras and optics) and accessories as well as selecting a suitable location in the real environment under surveillance. The <b>Safeguards</b> <b>inspector</b> can iteratively and interactively assess the vulnerability of the designed surveillance system by dynamically simulating different scenarios with moving items and characters, by changing sensor parameters and, if necessary, by introducing redundancy in the equipment. As a consequence, the nuclear inspector can increase her/his confidence in the design, both in terms of robustness and cost-effectiveness. S/he can further make a detailed preparation of the on-site installation, improving therefore the efficiency and reducing costs. The second demonstrator illustrates the use of VR technologies for a border security application, namely the training of customs officers when inspecting cargo trucks. Customs officers are key to the timely detection of illegal materials and sources during transportation and border crossing. The demonstrator follows typical customs procedures workflow, the aim being to let the officer getting acquainted with the use of radiation detection equipment within the context of his/her overall border security task. The demonstrator includes a radiation detector portal and comprises the operation by the customs officer of radiation detection equipment. Finally, in a more general perspective, the paper discusses the different ways that virtual-reality based tools can be used in radiation detection training, while minimising the use of radioactive sources.

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of safeguards strengthening measures approved by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors (1992 - 1997), international nuclear <b>safeguards</b> <b>inspectors</b> {{have been able to}} utilize environmental sampling (ES) (e. g. deposited particulates, air, water, vegetation, sediments, soil and biota) in their safeguarding approaches at bulk uranium/plutonium handling facilities. Enhancements of environmental sampling techniques used by the IAEA in drawing conclusions concerning the absence of undeclared nuclear materials or activities will soon be {{able to take advantage of}} a recent step change improvement in the gathering and analysis of air samples at these facilities. Location specific air monitoring feasibility tests have been performed with excellent results in determining attribute and isotopic composition of chemical elements present in an actual test-bed sample. Isotopic analysis of collected particles from an Aerosol Contaminant Extractor (ACE) collection, was performed with the standard bulk sampling protocol used throughout the IAEA network of analytical laboratories (NWAL). The results yielded bulk isotopic values expected for the operations. Advanced designs of air monitoring instruments such as the ACE may be used in gas centrifuge enrichment plants (GCEP) to detect the production of highly enriched uranium (HEU) or enrichments not declared by a State. Researchers at Savannah River National Laboratory in collaboration with Oak Ridge National Laboratory are developing the next generation of ES equipment for air grab and constant samples that could become an important addition to the international nuclear <b>safeguards</b> <b>inspector's</b> toolkit.

In view of a much higher radiological barrier, the addition of minor actinides to fresh fuel assemblies would change {{the way in which}} fresh fuel can be stored and handled, impacting not only on routine operations but also on the activities carried out during international safeguards inspections. While it is generally considered that the presence of minor actinides in fresh fuel assemblies would decrease the attractiveness of this potential target for a proliferator willing to divert nuclear material - thus increasing the proliferation resistance of the entire facility -, it might have perverse repercussions on the overall safeguardability of the target. In particular, the presence of minor actinides might complicate the measurement activities performed by <b>safeguards</b> <b>inspectors</b> during physical inventory verifications (PIV).

Since its implementation in the 1990 s, ES has proven to be very sensitive and effective. Considering the consequences, the measurements should be carried out under a quality management programme. At the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements, a new production method is under development for the preparation of reference uranium particles from well-certified UF 6, allowing uranium particles with certified isotopic abundances to be prepared that are representative of those found in uranium enrichment facilities. Using an aerosol deposition chamber designed and built for the purpose, particles are formed by the hydrolysis of UF 6 and their morphology and (isotopic) composition measured using SEM-EDX and SIMS. The SEM measurements show that by varying the relative humidity of the air in the reaction chamber, the morphology of the particles can be changed. By making a distribution map of the chemical composition of the particles, the relationship between fluorine and uranium as main constituents of the particle could be established. The presence of fluorine is a valuable indicator for the occurrence of nondeclared enrichment activities. JRC. E. 5 -Nuclear chemistr...|$|R

A set of 6 MOX pellets taken from a MOX fuel fabrication facility and transported to the laboratory was used for the calibration.

After recording gamma spectra and doing neutron measurements, both sets of pellets were characterized by destructive methods. The bias between Pu concentrations obtained from neutron measurements and from isotope-dilution mass-spectrometry was calculated. It was found to be between 0. 5 and 3 % depending on the calibration curve and on the source of isotopic data used for calculation. This accuracy may be sufficient for a quick preliminary assessment of the Pu inventory in MOX pellets by in-field instruments to immediately spot possible Pu diversion. However, to evaluate the material balance sending some pellets to the laboratory will remain required due to the smaller uncertainties achievable by destructive methods.

Results from PIV campaigns and comparisons between COMPUCEA results with data obtained by remote analysis with a qualified primary analytical method are presented, which demonstrate {{the performance of the}} technique. The achieved uncertainties are well within the international target values. First results obtained with a sandwich detector configuration for enhanced detection efficiency of the passive gamma spectrometry and a small separate X-ray fluorescence unit for the pre-screening of the samples for their Gd content are discussed.

40|$|Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) {{hosted a}} Workshop on Enhanced Recruiting for International Safeguards October 22 and 23, 2008. The {{workshop}} {{was sponsored by}} DOE/NA- 243 under the Next Generation Safeguards Initiative (NGSI). Placing well-qualified Americans in sufficient number and in key safeguards positions within the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA’s) Department of Safeguards is an important U. S. non-proliferation objective. The goal of the NGSI Workshop on Enhanced Recruiting for International Safeguards was to improve U. S. efforts to recruit U. S. citizens for IAEA positions in the Department of Safeguards. The participants considered the specific challenges of recruiting professional staff, <b>safeguards</b> <b>inspectors,</b> and managers. BNL’s International Safeguards Project Office invited participants from the U. S. Department of Energy, the IAEA, U. S. national laboratories, private industry, academia, and professional societies who are either experts in international safeguards or who understand the challenges of recruiting for technical positions. A final report for the workshop will be finalized and distributed in early 2009. The main finding of the workshop was {{the need for an}} integrated recruitment plan to take into account pools of potential candidates, various government and private agency stakeholders, the needs of the IAEA, and the NGSI human capital development plan. There were numerous findings related to and recommendations for maximizing the placement of U. S. experts in IAEA Safeguards positions. The workshop participants offered many ideas for increasing the pool of candidates and increasing the placement rate. This paper will provide details on these findings and recommendation...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{sampling}} {{has become}} {{a key component of}} International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards approaches since its approval for use in 1996. Environmental sampling supports the IAEA's mission of drawing conclusions concerning the absence of undeclared nuclear material or nuclear activities in a Nation State. Swipe sampling is the most commonly used method for the collection of environmental samples from bulk handling facilities. However, augmenting swipe samples with an air monitoring system, which could continuously draw samples from the environment of bulk handling facilities, could improve the possibility of the detection of undeclared activities. Continuous sampling offers the opportunity to collect airborne materials before they settle onto surfaces which can be decontaminated, taken into existing duct work, filtered by plant ventilation, or escape via alternate pathways (i. e. drains, doors). Researchers at the Savannah River National Laboratory and Oak Ridge National Laboratory have been working to further develop an aerosol collection technology that could be installed at IAEA safeguarded bulk handling facilities. The addition of this technology may reduce the number of IAEA inspector visits required to effectively collect samples. The principal sample collection device is a patented Aerosol Contaminant Extractor (ACE) which utilizes electrostatic precipitation principles to deposit particulates onto selected substrates. Recent work has focused on comparing traditional swipe sampling to samples collected via an ACE system, and incorporating tamper resistant and tamper indicating (TRI) technologies into the ACE system. Development of a TRI-ACE system would allow collection of samples at uranium/plutonium bulk handling facilities in a manner that ensures sample integrity and could be an important addition to the international nuclear <b>safeguards</b> <b>inspector's</b> toolkit. This work was supported by the Next Generation Safeguards Initiative (NGSI), Office of Nonproliferation and International Security (NIS), National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) ...|$|R
40|$|Executive Summary The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) {{implements}} {{nuclear safeguards}} and verifies countries are compliant with their international nuclear safeguards agreements. One {{of the key}} provisions in the safeguards agreement is the requirement that the country provide nuclear facility design and operating information to the IAEA relevant to safeguarding the facility, and {{at a very early}} stage., This provides the opportunity for the IAEA to verify the safeguards-relevant features of the facility and to periodically ensure that those features have not changed. The national authorities (State System of Accounting for and Control of Nuclear Material - SSAC) provide the design information for all facilities within a country to the IAEA. The design information is conveyed using the IAEA’s Design Information Questionnaire (DIQ) and specifies: (1) Identification of the facility’s general character, purpose, capacity, and location; (2) Description of the facility’s layout and nuclear material form, location, and flow; (3) Description of the features relating to nuclear material accounting, containment, and surveillance; and (4) Description of existing and proposed procedures for nuclear material accounting and control, with identification of nuclear material balance areas. The DIQ is updated as required by written addendum. IAEA <b>safeguards</b> <b>inspectors</b> examine and verify this information in design information examination (DIE) and design information verification (DIV) activities to confirm that the facility has been constructed or is being operated as declared by the facility operator and national authorities, and to develop a suitable safeguards approach. Under the Next Generation Safeguards Initiative (NGSI), the National Nuclear Security Administrations (NNSA) Office of Non-Proliferation and International Security identified the need for more effective and efficient verification of design information by the IAEA for improving international safeguards in the future. Consequently, the NNSA Office of International Regimes and Agreements (NA- 243) sponsored a team of U. S. Department of Energy National Laboratory nuclear safeguards experts and technologists to conduct a workshop on methods and technologies for improving this activity, under the ASA- 100 Advanced Safeguards Approaches Project. The workshop focused on reviewing and discussing the fundamental safeguards needs, and presented technology and/or methods that could potentially address those needs more effectively and efficiently. Conclusions and Recommendations for technology to enhance the performance of DIV inspections are presented by the workshop team...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} also freely {{available}} at: [URL] and Background: Both the statutory {{inquiry into the}} tragic death of Victoria Climbié (2003) and the first joint Chief Inspectors’ Report on <b>Safeguarding</b> (Chief <b>Inspector</b> of Social Services et al., 2002) emphasise the importance of effective joint working between agencies and professionals to safeguard children from harm and to promote their welfare. Subsequent policy developments, underpinned by the Children Act 2004, are intended to ensure an integrated approach to service provision and that children achieve their potential {{in terms of being}} healthy, staying safe, enjoying and achieving, making a positive contribution and achieving economic well-being (HM Government, 2004). Working Together to Safeguard Children (HM Government, 2006 : p. 10) identifies {{one of the most important}} developments in this context as the establishment of Local Safeguarding Children Boards (LSCBs). The Boards put former Area Child Protection Committees (ACPCs) on a statutory footing. Research had found that ACPCs’ lack of statutory power had limited their effectiveness (Chief Inspector of Social Services et al., 2002). A series of other weaknesses were also identified including: variations in levels of representation and membership, structure and practice, poor leadership and insufficient resources (Chief Inspector of Social Services et al., 2002; Horwath and Glennie, 1999; Narducci, 2003; Ward et al., 2004) ...|$|R
