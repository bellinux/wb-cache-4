We focus on credit choices, {{as they have been}} widely criticized for their complexity in recent years. In a first study, we find that complexity in benefits leads to random mistakes, while complexity in costs leads to a specific mistake: choosing a high-benefit loan, with very costly repayment schemes. In a second study, we show that individuals still (mistakenly) choose the high-benefit loan, even if cheaper and <b>simple</b> <b>loans</b> are available. This suggests that, when costs are complex, individuals bracket narrowly, focus on benefits and ignore costs, while they do not when benefits are complex. Hence, our results show that complexity and narrow bracketing may be deeply intertwined: complexity that makes narrow bracketing cognitively easier is likely to lead to myopic choices, such as choosing complex and expensive loans, despite the presence of <b>simple</b> and cheaper <b>loans.</b> ...|$|R

50|$|Also {{known as}} the sum-of-the-digits method, the Rule of 78s is a term used in lending that refers to a method of yearly {{interest}} calculation. The name comes from {{the total number of}} months' interest that is being calculated in a year (the first month is 1 month's interest, whereas the second month contains 2 months' interest, etc.). This is an accurate interest model only {{based on the assumption that}} the borrower pays only the amount due each month. If the borrower pays off the loan early, this method maximizes the amount paid (interest paid) by applying funds to interest before principal. In other words, in comparison to a <b>simple</b> interest <b>loan,</b> a rule of 78s loan will charge more interest if the loan is paid early.|$|R

Symmetric group loans are preferred to cosigned loans when borrowers are relatively equal, and cosigned loans are preferred when borrowers are unequal. This explains why microlenders that target the poor (e. g., the Grameen Bank) use symmetric group loans while other untargeted lenders use cosigned loans. Complicated menus of loan contracts that induce borrowers to self select can do no better than these <b>simple</b> <b>loan</b> contracts unless borrowers are very productive.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} stabilising the income of a country, henceforth the borrower, which would always prefer a stable income to a random income with the same average, i. e. a country which is risk-averse. This would be appropriate for countries which are heavily reliant upon agricultural output, or those whose exports are concentrated in a few markets with prices which fluctuate considerably. We suppose that there is another country, or possibly an international organisation, which is risk-neutral and has access to relatively large financial resources. We shall refer to this country as the lender. We further suppose that there is asymmetric information: the lender cannot observe the borrower's income. This is extreme though not that unrealistic in many cases. If {{there is more than}} one period a <b>simple</b> <b>loan</b> scheme can provide some insurance (Grossman, Levhari and Mirman [5], Yaari [11]). Townsend [10] has shown that it is possible to do better than these <b>simple</b> <b>loan</b> schemes by using efficient contracts. Our purpose is to examine the properties of efficient loan contracts for any time horizon and any discount factor. The efficient contract corresponds to the solution of a dynamic programming problem. So it can be calculated in a straightforward recursive manner. We can show directly that the second-best Pareto-frontier converges to the first-best frontier as the discount factor tends to one. So the efficient contract nearly provides the first-best utilities if the time horizon is sufficiently long and the discount factor is sufficiently high (Section 7). If the contract is fully enforeable and the time horizon is infinite then the borrower's utility becomes arbitrarily negative with probability one. This could be interpreted as saying that a debt crisis will develop with probability one. It also suggests that the contract will become difficult to enforce. Nevertheless even if the borrower is not legally bound by the contract it will still not break down (Section 6). In the special case where the borrower's utility function is exponential the contract transfers consumption between any two states at a constant rate of interest which is less than the rate of time preference (Section 8). This can be interpreted as saying that soft loans are optimal under these circumstances...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates {{whether the}} rate of {{interest}} such as the Treasury bill rate or {{the rate of}} return such as the return on a household portfolio is more relevant to the household’s intertemporal decision making. In a current era, households are diversifiers (to use Tobin’s 1958 term) and hold portfolios of assets rather than a <b>simple</b> <b>loan.</b> A portfolio of assets earns a composite return accounting for capital gains, taxes, and inflation, and rational agents make spending decisions based on expected total returns on a portfolio {{rather than on the}} return on a single asset. The total composite measure we use includes financial assets such as stocks and bonds and a real asset, residential housing. In particular, we estimate the intertemporal elasticity of substitution, namely, how a change in the asset or portfolio return affects household’s consumption growth. The estimates obtained using real after-tax composite return are about 0. 15 - 0. 3 and are more robust to linear and nonlinear estimations, different consumption measures, and various time periods than those obtained by using individual asset returns such as the Treasury bill rate. intertemporal elasticity of substitution, intertemporal choice, consumption, housing, portfolio return...|$|E

The grammaticalization process, reconstructed through the comparison with the other Romance languages and by relating it to typical directions of the linguistic change, presupposes intermediary semantic phases (the future-in-the-past value, the hypothetical value which is mostly counter-factual), whose traces may be found in the first Romanian (translated) texts, but which have been generally considered a consequence of the <b>simple</b> <b>loan</b> translation from the language source. The uses of the conditional with a reduced auxiliary (aș, ai, etc. + infinitive) are related to those (co-occurring in the old texts) of the conditional with a recognisable auxiliary (vrea ‘wanted’ + infinitive), for which the value specific to the first grammaticalization stage is still strong—that of a future-in-the past. The text also puts forth an explanation for the atypical forms within the paradigm of the conditional auxiliary—aș(i), ar(ă) —through the overlap between the forms of the imperfect and the simple past of the verb (a) vrea ‘(to) want’...|$|E

That is, borrowing and lending are possible under anarchy, and are supported by punishments that consist of cheating any cheater. Long-term implicit relationships may be fulfilled as the continual renegotiation of <b>simple</b> incomplete short-term <b>loans.</b> The analysis suggests that the crucial role of the explicit loan contract is the identification of the relationship and the parties involved. ...|$|R

[...] "We don't believe in charity" [...] said Parker [...] "our aim is to empower women to take charge of their own lives, long term". First priority is water {{and for the first time}} in a long while the Water Environment and Sanitation Department in North Darfur is in a position to drill as many hand pumps as Kids for Kids has money for. [...] "A hand pump can be named after a donor" [...] says Parker. Many Kids for Kids pumps are treasured as a living memorial for someone who has died, or to celebrate something special. In some areas, where hand pumps prove that there is plentiful water, they can be converted to submersible solar powered pumps which will help many people. This year one of the villages Kids for Kids is adopting is Kulkul, the village rebels took Parker and her son Alastair to when they were capture in 2005. Parker is hoping to be able to provide the first Kids for Kids' Solar Powered pump if they can raise the £20,000 ($30,358) Other Projects include the training of midwives—there is no health care in villages so that when there is obstructed labour, a common complication in a region where FGM (female genital mutilation) is widespread, means that rope delivery is the only form of help—first aid workers who treat simple wounds, teach hygiene and even build latrines—provide veterinary care, train in farming techniques and water harvesting, provide donkeys—the only transport in a region where there are no roads—donkey ploughs, carts and water carts, farm tools and seeds, blankets, mosquito nets and other household essentials—and, most importantly, the provision and repair of hand pumps. Long term improvement of the environment, the planting of trees, is another priority, and forms another source of income for families. An extensive tree planting campaign has been funded since 2006, with a Demonstration Garden in the main Tree Nursery in El Fasher, where trees planted back in 2006 are now tall enough to give shade and where people come to picnic at weekends. Kids for Kids has also funded a new Midwives Training School in El Fasher where they fund the training of 40 village midwives each year. But the Key project is a Goat Loan. The poorest 15 percent of families in each Kids for Kids village is lent six goats to provide milk immediately for the children and to enable mothers to have a livelihood as the little flock multiplies. At the end of two years six goats are passed on to another poor family, and so on. Eventually the whole community benefits from this <b>simple,</b> life changing, <b>loan.</b> It has been called the best Microfinance project ever. To ensure that the projects are sustainable and there is clear accountability, the management of the projects is carried out by village committees which are trained in book keeping—but, most importantly, they are accountable to their own communities. This has ensured that the projects have survived even during the worst periods of violence.|$|R
