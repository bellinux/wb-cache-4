40|$|The need of {{describing}} {{the quality of}} data ranges from data acquisition {{to the use of}} the data in geoinformation systems. The contractor should verify that the data he captured suffices the specifications and the end user wants to know, if the data is suited for a special task at hand. Both are interested in quantifying the quality, possibly by simple and meaningful measures, which can be easily computed without much further efforts – prohibitive with respect to involved labour and related costs. Much work has been already done on the standardization of principles of quality evaluation, reports and metadata (c. f. ISO standards 19113, 19114 and 19115), but only few contributions deal with the question of defining quality measures for a specific application, which possibly may be generalized for others as well. A recent project in cooperation with the Surveying Office of North Rhine-Westphalia investigates the topic of quality evaluation of photogrammetrically captured building models with the aim to identify useful quality measures which can be used for contract <b>specificatios</b> and to implement an approach for automated quality control based on a comparision of measurement and reference data.

40|$|The pourpose of this work, {{started with}} the Progetto Verde Milano in 2004, is the {{definition}} of the measuring procedure and of the statement of contents to use to implement the topographic database of the green areas with the ones step by step acquired by the Administration of Milan. The data thus collected will respect the conditions that allow the correct updating of the GIS of the green areas. The statement has been edited at first to allow the conversion from CAD files, which cannot be used to implement a thematic GIS, into a shapefile, which is the proper file for a GIS. The document is divided in three parts: 1. technical statement for topographic measuring; 2. contents statement; 3. supplying and graphic reproduction of data. The first part defines the aspects concerning the topographic measuring, specifying the operative steps of the measure taking, the instruments to use, the metrical precision required for every different kind of objects and the positioning procedure in the correct coordinate system. The second part concerns the structure of the database and the definition of the thesaurus of the objects to be measured, {{in such a way that}} they correspond to those used in the GIS of the green areas.
