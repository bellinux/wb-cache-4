En route, Carroll changed his family motto from In fide et in bello forte (strong in faith and war) to Ubicumque cum libertate (anywhere <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> be freedom). Soon after he left, the Protestant William of Orange invaded England, James II fled, and Parliament—which had been leery of James' Catholicism—recognized William and his wife Mary as the new King and Queen two weeks after Carroll's arrival in Maryland. This event, known as the Glorious Revolution, had profound implications {{for the future of}} the Maryland colony and for Carroll.|$|E

25|$|Court rulings in Saskatchewan {{have held}} that religious-based {{objections}} of provincial marriage commissioners to same-sex marriage {{do not need to}} be accommodated, because refusal by a government-appointed marriage commissioner to perform same-sex marriages would constitute a violation of the Charter equality rights of gay and lesbian individuals. In 2008, the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal held that marriage commissioner Orville Nichols had discriminated against a same-sex couple by refusing to perform their marriage ceremony. The Tribunal ordered him to pay $2,500 in compensation to the couple. In 2009, the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench upheld the Tribunal's decision. In response to a reference question from the Government of Saskatchewan, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal ruled in 2011 that two proposed bills which would have permitted marriage commissioners to refuse to perform same-sex marriages because of religious objections would be unconstitutional. Ordained religious ministers in Canada are not required to marry same-sex couples. A poll conducted in October 2006 found that 57% of Canadians believe that a marriage commissioner should be able to refuse to officiate at a gay wedding <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> are enough marriage commissioners available, and 72% felt that clergy should have the right to refuse to officiate if doing so would violate his or her religious beliefs.|$|E
25|$|Social {{motivation}} {{is tied to}} one's activity in a group. It cannot form from a single mind alone. For example, bowling alone is naught but the dull act of throwing a ball into pins, and so people are {{much less likely to}} smile during the activity alone, even upon getting a strike because their satisfaction or dissatisfaction {{does not need to be}} communicated, and so it is internalized. However, when with a group, people are more inclined to smile regardless of their results because it acts as a positive communication that is beneficial for pleasurable interaction and teamwork. Thus the act of bowling becomes a social activity as opposed to a dull action because it becomes an exercise in interaction, competition, team building, and sportsmanship. It is because of this phenomenon that studies have shown that people are more intrigued in performing mundane activities <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> is company because it provides the opportunity to interact in one way or another, be it for bonding, amusement, collaboration, or alternative perspectives. Examples of activities that may one may not be motivated to do alone but could be done with others for social benefit are things such as throwing and catching a baseball with a friend, making funny faces with children, building a treehouse, and performing a debate.|$|E

The current shape and structure of our societies would not be possible without the desire and the need to go further to explore what is beyond the horizon.

500|$|Carolina wrens are wary, and {{are more}} often heard than seen. When on the ground, they move in jerky hops pillaging through various objects, whether {{man-made}} or natural. While moving abruptly, they pause momentarily for chattering or singing. [...] When stationary, they move in twitched motions, jerking their breast around. They also sun- or sand-bathe. The wrens also displays a skittish behavior when encountered by humans, {{as they can be}} seen thrusting off into cover slowly if approaching is detected.

500|$|Tan Yock Lin has {{opined that}} the Court of Appeal was {{incorrect}} in dismissing over-inclusiveness {{on the ground}} that section 37(1) applies to all Singapore citizens as a class. Such reasoning amounts to the argument that class fairness is a tautology, where <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> is equality within the same class, it is considered fair. If this were the case, no classification would ever be over- or under-inclusive. Instead, Tan argues that the doctrine of reasonable classification is premised on the propriety of distinctions based on classes, and whether it is proper to treat those within the class differently from those outside. Tan also criticized the justification of under-inclusiveness purely on the basis of international comity. Whilst he accepts that the considerations of international comity [...] "explain why the nationality criterion is sound", he questions the under-inclusion of the permanent resident, an unexplained omission.|$|E

[...] The local children ostracize her because her father was a thief and a wife-beater. [...] In the dance, a young ruffian, much like her father at that age, flirts with her and abandons her as too young. [...] The dance concludes, and Billy is anxious to return to Earth and help his daughter. [...] He steals a star to take with him, as the Starkeeper pretends not to notice.|$|E

500|$|In general, Sullivan {{preferred}} {{to write in}} major keys. In the Savoy operas, there are only eleven substantial numbers wholly in a minor key (less than 5% of the musical numbers), and even in his serious works the major prevails. Examples of Sullivan's rare excursions into minor keys include the long E minor melody in the first movement of the Irish Symphony, [...] "Go away, madam" [...] in the Act I finale of Iolanthe (echoing Verdi and Beethoven) and the funeral march in the Act I finale of The Yeomen of the Guard. Sullivan was happy on occasion to use chords traditionally considered technically incorrect. When reproached for using consecutive fifths in Cox and Box, he replied [...] "if 5ths turn up it doesn't matter, <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> is no offence to the ear." [...] Hughes comments that harmonic contrast in the Savoy works is enhanced by Sullivan's characteristic modulation between keys, as in [...] "Expressive glances" [...] (Princess Ida), where he smoothly negotiates E major, C sharp minor and C major, or [...] "Then one {{of us will be}} a queen" [...] (The Gondoliers), where he writes in F major, D flat major and D minor.|$|E
500|$|The Court {{preferred}} the position taken in Gouriet {{rather than the}} more flexible approach taken in Re S (Hospital Patient: Court's Jurisdiction) (1995) where, <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> existed a [...] "real and present dispute between the parties as to the existence or extent of a legal right" [...] {{and each of the}} parties to the litigation [...] "would be affected by the determination of the issue", it was not necessary for the legal right to be vested in the parties. One of the reasons it came to this conclusion was that Re S is regarded by some scholars as more consistent with rule 40.20 of the Civil Procedure Rules, which states: [...] "The court may make binding declarations whether or not any other remedy is claimed." [...] On the other hand, the relevant Singaporean provision is Order 15, rule 16, of the Rules of Court, which reads: [...] "No action or other proceedings shall be open to objection on the ground that a merely declaratory judgment or order is sought thereby, and the Court may make binding declarations of right whether or not any consequential relief is or could be claimed." [...] Hence, the Court concluded that its jurisdiction to make declarations is [...] "confined to declaring contested legal rights of the parties represented in the litigation".|$|E
