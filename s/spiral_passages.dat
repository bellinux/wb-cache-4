40|$|We present Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) {{simulations}} {{of the response}} of gas discs to a spiral potential. These simulations show that the commonly observed spurs and feathering in spiral galaxies {{can be understood as}} being due to structures present in the spiral arms that are sheared by the divergent orbits in a spiral potential. Thus, dense molecular cloud-like structures generate the perpendicular spurs as they leave the spiral arms. Subsequent feathering occurs as spurs are further sheared into weaker parallel structures as they approach the next <b>spiral</b> <b>passage.</b> Self-gravity of the gas is not included in these simulations, stressing that these features are purely due to the hydrodynamics in spiral shocks. Instead, a necessary condition for this mechanism to work is that the gas need be relatively cold (1000 K or less) in order that the shock is sufficient to generate structure in the spiral arms, and such structure is not subsequently smoothed by the gas pressure.

In 2003 he has shown that the cosmic ray flux over the past billion years can be reconstructed from the {{exposure}} ages of Iron meteorites, that these flux variations are expected from <b>spiral</b> arm <b>passages,</b> and they correlate with the appearance of ice age epochs on Earth. In a later work with Ján Veizer, it was demonstrated that the temperature reconstruction over the Phanerozoic correlates with the cosmic ray flux, but it does not correlate with the CO2 reconstruction, thus placing an upper limit on the effects of CO2. This prompted several reactions by the climate community and rebuttals by Shaviv and his colleagues.|$|R
50|$|The Qabr-er-Rumia-- {{best known}} by its French name, Tombeau de la Chrétienne, {{tradition}} making it the burial-place of Florinda, la Cava Rumía, the beautiful and unfortunate daughter of Count Julian—is near Kolea, and {{is known to be}} the tomb of the Mauretanian king Juba II and of his wife Cleopatra Selene, daughter of Mark Antony and Cleopatra, queen of Egypt. It is built on a hill 756 ft above the sea. A circular stone building surmounted by a pyramid rests on a lower platform, 209 ft square. Originally the monument was about 130 ft in height, but it has been wantonly damaged. Its height is now 100 ft: the cylindrical portion 36 ft, the pyramid 64 ft The base, 198 ft in diameter, is ornamented with 60 engaged Ionic columns. The capitals of the columns have disappeared, but their design is preserved among the drawings of James Bruce, the African traveller. In the centre of the tomb are two vaulted chambers, reached by a <b>spiral</b> <b>passage</b> or gallery 6+1/2 ft, about the same height, and 489 ft. The sepulchral chambers are separated by a short passage, and are cut off from the gallery by stone doors made of a single slab which can be moved up and down by levers, like a portcullis. The larger of the two chambers is 142 ft long by 11 ft broad and 11 ft high. The other chamber is somewhat smaller. The tomb was early violated, probably in search of treasure. In 1555 Salah Rais, pasha of Algiers, set men to work to pull it down, but the records say that the attempt was given up because big black wasps came from under the stones and stung them to death. At the end of the 18th century Baba Mahommed tried in vain to batter down the tomb with artillery. In 1866 it was explored by order of the emperor Napoleon III, the work being carried out by Adrien Berbrugger and Oscar Maccarthy.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} problem of cosmic ray {{diffusion}} in the Milky Way while considering the galactic spiral arm dynamics. Once this new ingredient is added to cosmic ray diffusion models, {{we find that the}} cosmic ray flux reaching the solar system should increase periodically with each <b>passage</b> of a <b>spiral</b> arm. We continue with studying the meteoritic exposure ages and find that a record of past crossings of the arms can be extracted. We then briefly review recent evidence which links cosmic rays to climatic change on Earth. Given the suspected link, we argue that <b>spiral</b> arm <b>passages</b> are responsible for the periodic appearance of ice age epochs on Earth. This hypothesis is supported with a clear correlation between ice age epochs and the meteoritic record and also between longer term activity in the Milky Way and glacial activity on Earth.

40|$|Electron capture (EC) {{isotopes}} {{are known}} to provide constraints on the low energy behavior of cosmic rays (CRs), such as re-acceleration. Here we study the EC isotopes {{within the framework of}} the dynamic spiral-arms CR propagation model in which most of the CR sources reside in the galactic spiral arms. The model was previously used to explain the B/C and sub-Fe/Fe ratios BoverC,Iron. We show that the known inconsistency between the ^ 49 Ti/^ 49 V and ^ 51 V/^ 51 Cr ratios remains also in the spiral-arms model. On the other hand, unlike the general wisdom in which the isotope ratios depend primarily on reacceleration, we find here that the ratio also depends on the halo size (z_h) and in spiral-arms models also on the time since the last <b>spiral</b> arm <b>passage</b> (τ_arm). Namely, EC isotopes can in principle provide interesting constraints on the diffusion geometry. However, with the present uncertainties in the lab measurements of both the electron attachment rate and the fragmentation cross-sections, no meaningful constraint can be placed...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} highest-fidelity {{observations}} of the spiral galaxy M 51 in CO emission, revealing the evolution of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) vis-a-vis the large-scale galactic structure and dynamics. The most massive GMCs (so-called GMAs) are first assembled and then broken up as the gas flow through the spiral arms. The GMAs and their H 2 molecules are not fully dissociated into atomic gas as predicted in stellar feedback scenarios, but are fragmented into smaller GMCs upon leaving the spiral arms. The remnants of GMAs are detected as the chains of GMCs that emerge from the spiral arms into interarm regions. The kinematic shear within the spiral arms is sufficient to unbind the GMAs against self-gravity. We conclude that the evolution of GMCs is driven by large-scale galactic dynamics [...] their coagulation into GMAs is due to spiral arm streaming motions upon entering the arms, followed by fragmentation due to shear as they leave the arms on the downstream side. In M 51, {{the majority of the}} gas remains molecular from arm entry through the inter-arm region and into the next <b>spiral</b> arm <b>passage.</b> Comment: 6 pages, including 3 figures.

40|$|We {{develop a}} fully three {{dimensional}} numerical code describing {{the diffusion of}} cosmic rays in the Milky Way. It includes the nuclear spallation chain up to Oxygen, and allows the study of various cosmic ray properties, such as the CR age, grammage traversed, and the ratio between secondary and primary particles. This code enables us to explore a model in which a large fraction of the cosmic ray acceleration {{takes place in the}} vicinity of galactic spiral arms and that these spiral arms are dynamic. We show that the effect of having dynamic spiral arms is to limit the age of cosmic rays at low energies. This is because at low energies the time since the last <b>spiral</b> arm <b>passage</b> governs the Cosmic Ray (CR) age, and not diffusion. Using the model, the observed spectral dependence of the secondary to primary ratio is recovered without requiring any further assumptions such as a galactic wind, re-acceleration or various assumptions on the diffusivity. In particular, we obtain a secondary to primary ratio which increases with energy below about 1 GeV. Comment: Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journa...|$|R
40|$|We {{explore the}} {{development}} of structures in molecular gas in the Milky Way by applying {{the analysis of the}} brightness distribution function (BDF) and the brightness distribution index (BDI) in the archival data from the Boston University-Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory 13 CO J= 1 - 0 Galactic Ring Survey. The BDI measures the fractional contribution of spatially confined bright molecular emission over faint emission extended over large areas. This relative quantity is largely independent of the amount of molecular gas and of any conventional, pre-conceived structures, such as cores, clumps, or giant molecular clouds. The structured molecular gas traced by higher BDI is located continuously along the spiral arms in the Milky Way in the longitude-velocity diagram. This clearly indicates that molecular gas changes its structure as it flows through the spiral arms. Although the high-BDI gas generally coincides with H II regions, there is also some high-BDI gas with no/little signature of ongoing star formation. These results support a possible evolutionary sequence in which unstructured, diffuse gas transforms itself into a structured state on encountering the spiral arms, followed by star formation and an eventual return to the unstructured state after the <b>spiral</b> arm <b>passage.</b> Comment: 6 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ...|$|R

40|$|We analyze radial and {{azimuthal}} {{variations of}} the phase balance between the molecular and atomic interstellar medium (ISM) in the Milky Way (MW) using archival CO(J = 1 - 0) and HI 21 cm data. In particular, the azimuthal variations—between the spiral arm and interarm regions—are analyzed without any explicit definition of the spiral arm locations. We show that the molecular gas mass fraction, i. e., f_(mol) = Σ_H_ 2 /Σ_(HI) + Σ_H_ 2, varies predominantly in the radial direction: starting from ~ 100 at the center, remaining 50 % to R ~ 6 kpc and decreasing to ~ 10 %– 20 % at R = 8. 5 kpc when averaged over the whole disk thickness (from ~ 100 % to ≳ 60 %, then to ~ 50 % in the midplane). Azimuthal, arm-interarm variations are secondary: only ~ 20 % in the globally molecule-dominated inner MW, but becoming larger, ~ 40 %– 50 %, in the atom-dominated outskirts. This suggests that in the inner MW the gas remains highly molecular (f_(mol) > 50 %) as it moves from an interarm region into a spiral arm {{and back into the}} next interarm region. Stellar feedback does not dissociate molecules much, and the coagulation and fragmentation of molecular clouds dominate the evolution of the ISM at these radii. The trend differs in the outskirts where the gas phase is globally atomic (f_(mol) > 50 %). The HI and H_ 2 phases cycle through <b>spiral</b> arm <b>passage</b> there. These different regimes of ISM evolution are also seen in external galaxies (e. g., the LMC, M 33, and M 51). We explain the radial gradient of f_(mol) using a simple flow continuity model.

40|$|We {{study the}} effect of <b>spiral</b> arm <b>passages</b> on the {{evolution}} of star clusters on planar and circular orbits around the centres of galaxies. Individual passages with different relative velocity (V_drift) and arm width are studied using N-body simulations. When the ratio of the time it takes the cluster to cross the density wave to the crossing time of stars in the cluster is much smaller than one, the energy gain of stars can be predicted accurately in the impulsive approximation. When this ratio is much larger than one, the cluster is heated adiabatically and the net effect of heating is largely damped. For a given duration of the perturbation, this ratio is smaller for stars in the outer parts of the cluster compared to stars in the inner part. The cluster energy gain due to perturbations of various duration as obtained from our N-body simulations is in good agreement with theoretical predictions taking into account {{the effect of}} adiabatic damping. Perturbations by the broad stellar component of the spiral arms on a cluster are in the adiabatic regime and, therefore, hardly contribute to the energy gain and mass loss of the cluster. We consider the effect of crossings through the high density shocked gas in the spiral arms, which result in a more impulsive compression of the cluster. The time scale of disruption is shortest at ~ 0. 8 - 0. 9 R_CR since there V_drift is low. This location can be applicable to the solar neighbourhood. In addition, the four-armed spiral pattern of the Milky Way makes spiral arms contribute more to the disruption of clusters than in a similar but two-armed galaxy. Still, the disruption time due to spiral arm perturbations there is about an order of magnitude higher than what is observed for the solar neighbourhood. [ABRIDGED...|$|R
40|$|The {{orbits of}} {{the stars in the}} disk of the Galaxy, and their {{passages}} through the Galactic spiral arms, are a rarely mentioned factor of biosphere stability which might be important for long-term planetary climate evolution, with a possible bearing on mass extinctions. The Sun lies very near the co-rotation radius, where stars revolve around the Galaxy in the same period as the density wave perturbations of the spiral arms. Conventional wisdom generally considers that this status makes for few <b>passages</b> through the <b>spiral</b> arms. Controversy still surrounds whether time spent inside or around spiral arms is dangerous to biospheres and conducive to mass extinctions. Possible threats include giant molecular clouds disturbing the Oort comet cloud and provoking heavy bombardment; a higher exposure to cosmic rays near star forming regions triggering increased cloudiness in Earth’s atmosphere and ice ages; and the destruction of Earth’s ozone layer posed by supernova explosions. We present detailed calculations of the history of <b>spiral</b> arm <b>passages</b> for all 212 solar-type stars nearer than 20 parsecs, including the total time spent inside the spiral arms in the last 500 Myr, when the spiral arm position can be traced with good accuracy. We found that there is a large diversity of stellar orbits in the solar neighborhood, and the time fraction spent inside spiral arms can vary from a few percent to nearly half the time. The Sun, despite its proximity to the galactic co-rotation radius, has exceptionally low eccentricity and a low vertical velocity component, and therefore spends 30 % of its lifetime crossing the spiral arms, more than most nearby stars.

Capillaries from the stria vascularis and spiral ligament were treated enzymatically to free them from surrounding tissue. Contamination by extraneous tissue was minimized by banding capillary segments in Percoll gradients and culture in plasma-derived serum on a fibronectin-coated substrate. Although only small amounts of inner ear tissue were available, tritiated thymidine autoradiography demonstrated that considerable growth in culture was possible. Addition of heparin and endothelial cell growth supplement to the medium enhanced proliferation. The endothelial origin of the cultured cells was confirmed by immunofluorescent demonstration {{of the presence of}} Factor VIII-related antigen and angiotensin-converting enzyme.

40|$|Global {{extinction}} and geological {{events have}} previously been linked with galactic {{events such as}} spiral arm crossings and galactic plane oscillation. The expectation that these are repeating predictable events has led to studies of periodicity in a wide set of biological, geological and climatic phenomena. Using data on carbon isotope excursions, large igneous provinces and impact craters, we identify three time zones of high geological activity which relate to the timings of {{the passage of the}} Solar System through the spiral arms. These zones are shown to include a significantly large proportion of high extinction periods. The mass extinction events at the ends of the Ordovician, Permian and Cretaceous occur in the first zone, which contains the predicted midpoints of the spiral arms. The start of the Cambrian, end of the Devonian and end of the Triassic occur in the second zone. The pattern of extinction timing in relation to spiral arm structure is supported by the positions of the superchrons and the predicted speed of the <b>spiral</b> arms. The <b>passage</b> times through an arm are simple multiples of published results on impact and fossil record periodicity and galactic plane half-periods. The total estimated passage time through four arms is 703. 8 Myr. The repetition of extinction events at the same points in different spiral arm crossings suggests a common underlying galactic cause of mass extinctions, mediated through galactic effects on geological, solar and extra-solar processes.
