The final version is available from via American Dairy Science Association [URL] multiparous Holstein-Friesian dairy cows were used in a replicated 3 ? 3 Latin square changeover design experiment to test the effects of changing from corn (Zea mays) silage to red clover (Trifolium pratense) silage in graded proportions on feed intakes, milk production, and whole-body N and P partitioning. Three dietary treatments with ad libitum access to 1 of 3 forage mixtures plus a <b>standard</b> <b>allowance</b> of 4 kg/d dairy concentrates were offered. The 3 treatment forage mixtures were, on a dry matter (DM) basis: (1) R 10 : 90 % corn silage and 10 % red clover silage, (2) R 50 : 50 % corn silage and 50 % red clover silage, and (3) R 90 : 10 % corn silage and 90 % red clover silage. In each of 3 experimental periods, there were 21 d for adaptation to diets, and 7 d for measurements. Diet crude protein intakes increased, and starch intakes decreased, as the silage mixture changed from 90 % corn to 90 % red clover, although the highest forage DM intakes and milk yields were achieved on diet R 50. Although milk fat yields were unaffected by diet, milk protein yields were highest with the R 50 diet. Whole-body partitioning of N was measured in a subset of cows (n = 9), and both the daily amount and proportion of N consumed that was excreted in feces and urine increased as the proportion of red clover silage in the diet increased. However, the apparent efficiency of utilization of feed N for milk protein production decreased from 0. 33 g/g for diet R 10 to 0. 25 g/g for diet R 90. The urinary excretion of purine derivatives (sum of allantoin and uric acid) tended to increase, suggesting greater flow of microbial protein from the rumen, as the proportion of red clover silage in the diet increased, and urinary creatinine excretion was affected by diet. Fecal shedding of E. coli was not affected by dietary treatment. In conclusion, even though microbial protein flow may have been greatest from the R 90 diet, optimum feed intakes and milk yields were achieved on a diet that contained a 1 : 1 DM mixture of corn and red clover silagesauthorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|E

The postmortem examin-ation of a newborn infant differs from that of an adult in a number of ways, especially in the method of removal and dissection of the brain, the examination of the cervical spine, the dissection of the cardiovascular system for congenital abnormalities, and the examination ofthe placenta. A systematic technique for performing a perinatal necropsy is described. Stress is laid on measurement {{of the size of the}} infant and of the individual organs and comparison of these with known <b>standards,</b> <b>allowance</b> being made for the maturity of the infant. A perinatal postmortem examination may be made for two purposes. First, to obtain as much informa-tion as possible to determine the immediate cause of death of a particular infant. Second, for a wider study along epidemiological lines to ascertain the part played by various factors in causing foetal and infant death. For both these purposes the mother's and infant's case notes should be available to the pathologist. Both naked-eye and histological examination of the tissue is necessary and in still-born foetuses the placenta should always be examined; microbiological and serological studies may also be valuable.

40|$|The {{effect of}} crop type, crop {{allowance}} and feeding frequency on DM intake, {{body condition score}} (BCS) gain, grazing behaviour and rumen physiology of dairy cattle fed forage crops during winter was examined in three experiments. Experiment 1 examined the effect of wintering dairy cows outdoors on the industry <b>standard</b> <b>allowance</b> of kale (11 kg DM of kale + 3 kg DM of barley straw, K 11), with the higher allowance of kale (14 kg DM of kale + 3 kg DM of barley straw, K 14) and Italian ryegrass at low allowance (11 kg DM + 3 kg DM of barley straw, G 11). BCS gain over the six week winter feeding period was higher for K 14 and G 11 (0. 3 BCS units) than K 11 (0. 2 BCS units). The % DM utilisation of K 11 (96 %) and K 14 (88 %) were higher than G 11 (70 %), leading to higher DM intake in K 14 (12. 1 kg DM of kale/cow/day) and K 11 (10. 5 kg DM of kale/cow/day) than G 11 (7. 9 kg DM of grass/cow/day). Within 6 hours of being offered a fresh break, cows had consumed over 86 % of their apparent daily intake with DM consumptions of 10. 4, 10. 5 and 7. 3 kg DM/cow for the K 11, K 14 and G 11 treatments, respectively. Grazing behaviour was altered by both forage type and allowance. Cows on the K 14 treatment grazed for longer over the day than cows in K 11 and G 11. Rumen ammonia concentrations peaked 7 h after the morning allocation of feed and concentrations ranged from 108 to 212 mg NH 3 /l for K 14, 91 to 306 mg NH 3 /l for K 11 and 57 to 269 mg NH 3 /l for G 11. Rumen pH fell to reach its lowest values of 5. 7 for G 11, 6. 0 for K 11 and 6. 2 for K 14 between 7 - 10 h after feeding forage in all treatments. However, the rumen pH of K 11 and K 14 remained high (> 6. 0) throughout the day. Further, from bout counts of rumen pH, G 11 had more frequent and longer bouts of rumen pH under each threshold except the threshold 6. 4 compared with K 11 or K 14. Hence, there was little evidence of sub-acute rumen acidosis (SARA) in kale-fed cows. Urinary N% was higher for K 11 (0. 58 %) than K 14 (0. 43 %) and G 11 (0. 52 %). Faecal and urine N output per cow was higher for K 14 (335 g N/cow/day) and K 11 (289 g N/cow/day) than G 11 (227 g N/cow/day). Based on stocking density, total faecal and urine N output per hectare was higher for K 11 (413 kg N/ha) and K 14 (355. 9 kg N/ha) than G 11 (82. 3 g N/cow/day). iii Experiment 2 examined the effect on rumen physiology of feeding cattle either once (1. 5 kg DM/day barley straw at 0800 h plus 7 kg DM/day of kale at 0900 h, K 1) or twice (0. 75 kg DM barley straw 0800 h plus 3. 5 kg DM kale 0900 h and 0. 75 kg DM barley straw at 1400 h plus 3. 5 kg DM of kale at 1500 h, K 2) per day over a 7 day period in individual metabolism crates. No significant differences were observed between the two treatment groups in the rumen concentration of acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, ammonia and rumen pH. There was a distinct diurnal pattern of rumen ammonia concentration which was characterized by a peak 2 h post feeding for both K 1 and K 2. Rumen ammonia concentration ranged from 27. 5 mg NH 3 /l to 170 mg NH 3 /l for K 1 and from 43. 7 mg NH 3 /l to 158 mg NH 3 /l for K 2. Rumen pH remained high (> 5. 8) on both treatment groups. Experiment 3 examined the effect of wintering dairy cows outdoors on either kale or grass fed in one (11 kg DM kale + 3 kg DM of baled barley straw offered in the morning) or two allocations (5. 5 kg DM of kale grazed + 1. 5 kg DM barley straw offered morning and afternoon) per day. BCS gain over the six week winter feeding period was higher for grass-fed cows (0. 5 BCS units) than kale-fed cows (0. 2 BCS units), but unaffected by feeding frequency. % DM utilization was higher for kale-fed (97 %) than grass-fed cows (76 %) leading to higher apparent DM intake of forage in kale-fed (9. 7 kg DM/cow/day) than grass-fed cows (7. 7 kg DM/cow/day). % DM utilization and apparent DM intake were not affected by feeding frequency. Prehension bite rate was greater for grass-fed (37. 3 bites/min) than kale-fed cows (7. 6 bites/min), but more mastication bites were required for kale-fed cows. Cumulative DM intake after 2, 3 and 6 h was greater in cows fed once than twice a day and for kale than grass after 3 and 6 h. Mean eating time was greater on cows offered forage once (477 min) than twice (414 min) per day. Rumen ammonia concentration rose rapidly after the first meal, with all four treatments reaching a peak value within 3 hours of grazing time. From the bout counts, cows which were fed grass recorded the most frequent rumen pH of 5. 8) for kale-fed cows, hence indicating no evidence of SARA. The calculated faecal and urine N output/ha were higher for kale than grass-fed cows reflecting greater yield of kale leading to increased stocking density...|$|E

The energy content (Kcal) from carbohydrate, the primary source of energy for Amala and Jollof beans meals was determined and found to be 283. 42 and 136. 34 respectively. These results were then compared with the <b>Standard</b> Recommended <b>Allowance</b> and the <b>Standard</b> Energy/Calorie Requirements for different age groups.
