Another, two-hour strike took place on December 14. On May 19, 1993, Solidarity deputies proposed a no-confidence motion—which passed—against the government of Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka. President Wałęsa declined to accept the prime minister's resignation, and dismissed the parliament.|$|E
5|$|A {{vote was}} held on 3 May 1965 in which the {{committee}} voted to <b>strike</b> <b>against</b> Coachella Valley grape growers. Although the strikers weren't able to negotiate {{a contract with the}} growers, they did succeed in winning higher wages. Following the success in Southern California, on 8 September 1965 the Agriculture Workers Organizing Committee voted to <b>strike</b> <b>against</b> grape growers in Delano, California, where the grape season starts in September. This strike became the first time Mexican workers, due to the decision of Cesar Chavez, did not break a strike of Filipinos; later, on 16 September 1965, Chavez's National Farm Workers Association joined the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee on the picket lines. These strikes occurred around the same time when younger Filipino Americans began a period of political self-reflection and awakening.|$|E

25|$|SAD teams also {{conducted}} high-risk special reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines to identify senior leadership targets. These missions {{led to the}} initial <b>strikes</b> <b>against</b> Saddam Hussein and his key generals. Although the initial <b>strikes</b> <b>against</b> Saddam were unsuccessful in killing the dictator or his generals, they were successful in effectively ending the ability to command and control Iraqi forces. Other <b>strikes</b> <b>against</b> key generals were successful and significantly degraded the command's ability to react to and maneuver against the U.S.-led invasion force coming from the south.|$|R

5|$|Hitler was satisfied. The {{reasoning}} of the Luftwaffe seemed sound. Should {{the bombing}} achieve its aim, it offered considerable strategic value. The <b>strike</b> <b>against</b> London meant {{that most of}} the fighting on 15 September would take place between Luftflotte 2 under Albert Kesselring and Keith Park’s No. 11 Group RAF.|$|E
5|$|In September 1913, the United Mine Workers {{called a}} <b>strike</b> <b>against</b> coal-mining {{companies}} in Ludlow, Colorado. The largest mining company was the Rockefeller family-owned Colorado Fuel & Iron Company. On April20, 1914, the Colorado National Guard attacked a tent colony of striking miners {{and their families}} and, during a day-long fight, 26 people were killed.|$|E
5|$|News {{of the two}} strikes, {{with the}} mistaken reports that each had sunk an American carrier, greatly {{improved}} Japanese morale. The few surviving aircraft were all recovered aboard Hiryū. Despite the heavy losses, the Japanese believed that they could scrape together enough aircraft for one more <b>strike</b> <b>against</b> what they {{believed to be the}} only remaining American carrier.|$|E

The destroyer sortied with TG 58.2 on 10 February {{and participated in}} the carrier <b>strikes</b> <b>against</b> the Tokyo area on, 16 and 17 February. From 19 through 22 February, <b>strikes</b> were launched <b>against</b> Iwo Jima to support the landing there. Two days later, the carriers sailed towards Japan and, on 25 February, launched air <b>strikes</b> <b>against</b> targets in the Tokyo Bay area before returning to Ulithi on 1 March.|$|R

5|$|Roughly {{three years}} after the {{foundation}} stone laying ceremony, the airport was inaugurated on 14 March 2008 amid protests. The Telugu Desam Party repeated its demand for the naming of the domestic terminal. In addition, on 12 and 13 March, 20,000 AAI employees had conducted a <b>strike</b> <b>against</b> the closure of Begumpet Airport, {{as well as that of}} HAL Airport in Bangalore, fearing they would lose their jobs.|$|E

The Boss kills Cyrus, but is unable to stop him from launching the missile. Climbing aboard it, the Boss disarms the nuke before it reaches Washington, earning the adoration of America.|$|E

Together with Vera Cruz, Itliong worked towards building a retirement facility for UFW workers, known as Agbayani Village. Although {{no longer in the}} United Farm Workers, Itliong continued to support others in the organized labor movement, such as helping others plan a <b>strike</b> <b>against</b> Safeway supermarkets in 1974. Itliong also served as President of the Filipino American Political Association, a bipartisan lobbying organization. He died in 1977 at the age of 63 in Delano of Lou Gehrig's disease.|$|E

25|$|After {{refueling}} at sea, {{the light}} cruiser {{spent the next}} two weeks screening the carriers during air <b>strikes</b> <b>against</b> Guam and Rota in the Marianas. On 24 July, the task group sailed south for <b>strikes</b> <b>against</b> Palau, Yap, and Ulithi. Japanese air operations during both these operations were limited and no enemy aircraft closed the task group.|$|R
5|$|Covert operations, however, {{were another}} matter. One {{result of the}} {{increasing}} PAVN road building effort in Cambodia was that the U.S. also upped the ante against the trail system in Laos by launching the first B-52 Stratofortress <b>strike</b> <b>against</b> the logistical system on 12 December 1965. In April 1967 the U.S. headquarters in Saigon finally received authorization to launch Daniel Boone, an intelligence gathering operation that conducted by the highly secret Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group or SOG.|$|E
5|$|Fletcher, {{along with}} Yorktowns {{commanding}} officer, Captain Elliott Buckmaster, and their staffs, had acquired first-hand experience in organizing and launching a full <b>strike</b> <b>against</b> an enemy {{force in the}} Coral Sea, {{but there was no}} time to pass these lessons on to Enterprise and Hornet which were tasked with launching the first strike. Spruance ordered the striking aircraft to proceed to target immediately, rather than waste time waiting for the strike force to assemble, since neutralizing enemy carriers was the key to the survival of his own task force.|$|E
5|$|Hiryū began {{recovering}} her Midway strike {{force at}} around 09:00 and finished shortly by 09:10. The landed aircraft were quickly struck below, while the carriers' crews began preparations to spot aircraft for the <b>strike</b> <b>against</b> the American carrier forces. The preparations were interrupted at 09:18, {{when the first}} attacking American carrier aircraft were sighted. These consisted of 15 Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo bombers of VT-8, led by Lieutenant Commander John C. Waldron from the Hornet. They attempted a torpedo attack on Soryū, {{but all of the}} American planes were shot down by the 18 CAP fighters, leaving one surviving aviator treading water.|$|E

50|$|The {{squadron}} {{carried out}} counter-air <b>strikes</b> <b>against</b> Risalewala and Chander airfields with immense success, despite stiff opposition. It provided CAS to ground {{units in the}} Dra-Baba-Nanak, Husseinwala and Firozpur sectors. The squadron virtually paralysed the Pakistani armour thrust, due to numerous <b>strikes</b> <b>against</b> enemy gunning positions, armour, and troops, exposing weak flanks to the ground forces.|$|R
5000|$|Together with a statement, {{that same}} day, of the Jordan Armed Forces, saying their Air Force had at dawn {{launched}} <b>strikes</b> <b>against</b> [...] "terrorist groups", and with U.S. announcements {{that they had}} begun strikes inside Syria together with partner nations, this brought The Jordan Times to conclude that, apparently, Jordan had joined the US-led <b>strikes</b> <b>against</b> ISIL in Syria.|$|R
5|$|In April 1989, {{after the}} miners had worked 14 months without benefits, UMWA {{president}} Richard Trumka declared a <b>strike</b> <b>against</b> the Pittston Coal Company. Around 2,000 UMWA members {{who worked for}} Pittston {{walked out of the}} mines and reported to the picket line. Pittston responded to the strike by hiring replacement workers. To ensure that production would continue, Pittston also had help from the state police to escort the replacement miners and coal trucks across the picket line.|$|E
5|$|In July 1893 {{a peasant}} conference at Corleone drafted model agrarian {{contracts}} for labourers, sharecroppers and tenants and presented {{them to the}} landowners. When those refused to negotiate, a <b>strike</b> <b>against</b> landowners and against state taxes broke out over {{a large part of}} western Sicily. The so-called Patti di Corleone (Corleone Covenants), are considered by historians to be the first trade union collective contract in capitalist Italy. In September the state authorities intervened and some of the landowners were persuaded to capitulate. Elsewhere the strike continued until November 1893. Railwaymen of Catania and Palermo, the sulphur-miners and many other workers followed their example winning higher wages or better working conditions.|$|E
5|$|In June and July 1991, {{the short}} armed {{conflict}} in Slovenia {{came to a}} speedy end, {{partly because of the}} ethnic homogeneity of the population of Slovenia. It was later revealed that a military <b>strike</b> <b>against</b> Slovenia, followed by a planned withdrawal, was conceived by Slobodan Milošević and Borisav Jović, then president of the SFR Yugoslavia presidency. Jović published his diary containing the information and repeated it in his testimony at the Milošević trial at the ICTY.|$|E

The satellite's destruction temporarily disables a Federation {{base on the}} planet, allowing the resistance to successfully attack it and destroy numerous droids and heavy equipment. During the fight, Sykes commandeers a Federation gunboat and uses it to liberate labor camps along the Andrevea River, escorting the freed prisoners to a rendezvous point among ruins to the north.|$|E
5|$|On 19 November 2006, the Civic Party, Democratic Party, Harbour-front Enhancement Committee, Hong Kong Institute of Architects, People's Sustainable Development Committee, Clear the Air, and Earth Care jointly met to {{urge the}} public {{to fight for the}} {{preservation}} of the pier. Over 1,000 signatures were collected on that one day alone, in a petition to be submitted to Chief Executive Donald Tsang and other senior officials. In addition, a group of protesters began a peaceful sit-in that day.
