50|$|Modern {{spinning}} mills {{are mainly}} built around {{open end spinning}} techniques using rotors or ring <b>spinning</b> techniques using <b>spindles.</b> In 2009 there were 202,979,000 ring <b>spinning</b> <b>spindles</b> installed worldwide, with 82% of these being in Asia or Oceania and 44% being within China. In the same year there were 7,975,000 open end spinning rotors installed, with 44% of these being within Asia or Oceania and 29% within Eastern Europe. The average age of installed rotors is much {{lower than that of}} spindles and as rotors are between 7 and 10 times more productive they are responsible for 20% of the cotton spun worldwide.|$|R
50|$|On Saliango (at {{that time}} {{connected}} to its two neighbours, Paros and Antiparos), houses of stone without mortar have been found, {{as well as}} Cycladic statuettes. Estimates based on excavations in the cemetery of Kephala put the number of inhabitants at between forty-five and eighty. Studies of skulls have revealed bone deformations, especially in the vertebrae. They {{have been attributed to}} arthritic conditions, which afflict sedentary societies. Osteoporosis, another sign of a sedentary lifestyle, is present, but more rarely than on the continent in the same period. Life expectancy has been estimated at twenty years, with maximum ages reaching twenty-eight to thirty. Women tended to live less than men. A sexual division of labour seems to have existed. Women took care of children, harvesting, “light” agricultural duties, “small” livestock, <b>spinning</b> (<b>spindle</b> whorls have been found in women’s tombs), basketry and pottery. Men busied themselves with “masculine” chores: more serious agricultural work, hunting, fishing, and work involving stone, bone, wood and metal. This sexual division of labour led to a first social differentiation: the richest tombs of those found in cists are those belonging to men. Pottery was made without a lathe, judging by the hand-modelled clay balls; pictures were applied to the pottery using brushes, while incisions were made with the fingernails. The vases were then baked in a pit or a grinding wheel—kilns were not used and only low temperatures of 700˚-800˚C were reached. Small-sized metal objects have been found on Naxos. The operation of silver mines on Siphnos may also date to this period.|$|E

50|$|The {{throstle}} {{frame was}} an early method of spinning yarn, and was a direct descendant of the spinning wheel. The rovings were attenuated by rollers as in the later ring frame. The thread was collected on free <b>spinning</b> <b>spindles</b> which had a flyer above which acted as the twisting mechanism. The flyer always maintains a uniform velocity, though the bobbin retarded by friction, is pulled around the spindle by the tension of the yarn allowing the variation needed {{to account for the}} increasing diameter. It was very suited to producing high quality yarn of the coarser counts.|$|R

5000|$|The mule-jenny {{twisted the}} rovings using rollers {{in the manner}} of Arkwright's frame, while the spindle {{carriage}} moved back and forth 54 inches to stretch the thread, and then to gather it in the <b>spinning</b> <b>spindles</b> {{in the manner of}} Hargreaves jenny. [...] The mule's importance was that it could spin thread better than could be done by hand, which led to ever finer thread. Coarse thread (40s) sold for 14 shillings per pound whilst (80s) spun on his mule sold at 42 shillings a pound.As the mule was unpatented others soon manufactured it. The machine was constructed in iron, power was applied to assist the inward motion in 1790 and by 1834 it was fully automatic or self-acting. A survey in 1812 showed there were between 4 and 5 million mule spindles in use. Crompton received no royalties for his invention.|$|R
5000|$|The mill, {{belonging}} to the Oustal (restaurant) Jupiter rue du Barry according to the cadastre of 1841, has certainly a more ancient origin. The owner, Jean-Baptiste Berger sells it to Mr. Maurin, and passes by marriage to Mr. Saurin. In 1869, the mill is transformed into woolen mill (with 4 sets of carding and <b>spinning</b> <b>spindles</b> 144) led successively by Joseph Fulcrand, M. Bayle (1874) and David Saumade (from 1884, with a single range of chard). Mr. Saurin's son transforms spinning mill into a sawmill in 1902. The activity ceases before the Second World War. The building is then converted into a house. The vertical waterwheel with a fall of 2 meters (150 liters per second), built in 1869, is destroyed around 1965.

5000|$|Pygoras {{live for}} 12 to 14 years, and are {{commonly}} used for fiber, along with being show, breeding, and fiber-producing animals. The weight of a healthy Pygora depends on {{whether it is a}} male, female or kid. Most kids are about 5 pounds at birth; does range in weight from 65 to 75 pounds and bucks and wethers range from 75 to 95 pounds. Pygora fiber is frequently used by artists for <b>spinning,</b> <b>spindling,</b> knitting, crocheting, weaving, tapestries, and other fiber arts. [...] It is also commonly used in clothing. Pygoras can also be milked, producing about one liter per day. Pygora wethers generally have higher quality fiber than the does and bucks because they do not spend all their energy producing young. Pygora are mainly for producing fiber, but some people also show them as a hobby, in fairs, fiber shows, and in 4H. Some pygora breeders and 4-H clubs show goats at the Oregon Flock and Fibre Festival (OFFF). Angoras can be found there as well.|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} for archaeological {{evidence of the}} wool production in the Roman period {{in the region of}} Padua, in the past divided into the two cities of Patavium and Ateste, has recovered many tools from the weaving process (exclusively loom weights), just a few concerning <b>spinning</b> (<b>spindles,</b> spindle whorls, distaffs, spindles/distaffs, spindle hooks), but none used during shearing (i. e. clippers). The material remains examined are mostly dated generically at the Roman age, but those which a more accurate chronological attribution is possible, they all date from the I century B. C. and the I century A. D. The objects were found in two different recovery site contexts: spinning tools were found mostly in tombs, both in Padua and in Este, but also in places of worship; the loom weights, instead, come mainly from the countryside of Padua region. An extraordinary finding is represented by the two ground surfaces completely full of loom weights, discovered at the border of Patavium. Morphological and weight analysis have been conducted on spinning whorls and loom weights; an accurate comparison of decorations and inscriptions has also been done on the last ones...|$|R

50|$|In Western Europe {{there were}} two common forms of distaffs, {{depending}} on the spinning method. The traditional form is a staff, held under one's arm while using a spindle.

50|$|There {{are quite}} a few {{variations}} of in-boom furling available. Generally the boom is hollow with a spindle in the center upon which the sail is rolled (furled). The techniques for turning the spindle vary, but frequently a line is used to <b>spin</b> the <b>spindle</b> and recover or reef the sail. In most cases the sail can be full battened and has virtually infinite reefing options. Some sailors consider this approach safer than in-mast furling, since the sail can be lowered and flaked in the traditional method, in the case of mechanical failure. In most applications, the sail can be lowered or reefed from the cockpit. Most designs will not accommodate a loose-footed mainsail.|$|R
