40|$|This work {{concerns}} designing multiregional supervisory fuzzy PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) {{control for}} pH reactors. The proposed work focuses, mainly, on two themes. The {{first one is}} to propose a multiregional supervisory fuzzy-based cascade control structure. It would enable modifying dynamics and enhance system’s stability. The fuzzy system (master loop) has been chosen as a tuner for PID controller (<b>slave</b> <b>loop).</b> It takes into consideration parameters uncertainties and reference tracking. The second theme concerns designing a hybrid neural network-based pH estimator. The proposed estimator would overcome the industrial drawbacks, that is, cost and size, found with conventional methods for pH measurement. The final end-user-interface (EUI) front panel and the results that evaluate {{the performance of the}} supervisory fuzzy PID-based control system and hybrid NN-based estimator have been presented using the compatibility found between LabView and MatLab. They lead to conclude that the proposed algorithms are appropriate to systems nonlinearities encountered with pH reactors...|$|R
40|$|A {{closed-loop}} controller for hypnosis {{was designed}} and validated on humans at our laboratory. The controller aims at regulat-ing the Bispectral Index (BIS) - a surro-gate measure of hypnosis derived from the electroencephalogram of the patient- with the volatile anesthetic isoflurane administered with a closed-circuit breathing system. The control algorithm consists of a cascaded Inter-nal Model Controller (IMC) where the master loop aims at regulating BIS. The <b>slave</b> <b>loop</b> tracks endtidal concentration references pro-vided by the master controller. In this paper, a new tuning method is presented. First, a ro-bust design procedure which guarantees sta-bility of the slave controller despite paramet-ric uncertainties is described. Then, we will demonstrate how the estimation of the drug’s equilibration constant ke 0 greatly improves performance if the estimated value is used to update the models in the control scheme. In order to do so, an identification scheme for ke 0 is proposed, which requires estimation of the drug’s time to peak effect tpeak. The identifica-tion algorithm requires few modeling assump-tions and guarantees convergence. Simulation results are presented, which quantify both {{the performance of the}} identification scheme and the improvement of the closed-loop control performance...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{molecular weight}} {{control of a}} batch polymerization reactorwhere suspension polymerization of methyl methacrylate(MMA) takes place. For this purpose, a cascade control structure with two control loops has been selected. The <b>slave</b> <b>loop</b> is used for temperature control using on-line temperature measurements, and the master loop controls the average molecular weights based on its estimated values. Two different control algorithms namely proportional-inte-gral(PI) controller and globally linearizing controller (GLC) {{have been used for}} tem-perature control. An estimator, which has the structure of an extended Kalman filter (EKF), is used for estimating monomer conversion and average molecular weights of polymer using reactor temperature measurements. The performance of proposed control algorithm is evaluated through simulation and experimental studies. The results indicate that a constant average molecular weight cannot be achieved in case of strong gel effect. However, the polydispersity of product will be lower in compari-son to isothermal operation. It is also shown that in case of model mismatch, the per-formance of cascade control is superior compared to the case where only reactor temperature is controlled based on desired temperature trajectory obtained through cascade strategy...|$|R
40|$|In {{the fine}} {{chemical}} industry the batch or fed-batch reactor functions as {{the heart of the}} transformation process. Due to the complexity of chemical synthesis, the control of these reactors remains a problem of temperature control commonly performed indirectly via the jacket of the reactor. This results in a cascade control scheme based on the control a secondary, more responsive process that influences the main process. This control loop {{is often referred to as}} the <b>slave</b> <b>loop</b> of the process. This paper highlights that the slave process of batch process units, i. e. the jacket of the reactor, can have more complex dynamics than the master loop has; and very often this could be the reason for the non-satisfying control performance. Since the slave process is determined by the mechanical construction of the unit, the above mentioned problem can be effectively handled by a model-based controller designed using an appropriate nonlinear tendency model. The presented analysis shows that the complex dynamics of the slave process can be decomposed into static nonlinear and dynamic linear parts. This decomposition is beneficial since it allows the effective incorporation of the resulted tendency model into nonlinear model-based control algorithms. Real-time control results show that the proposed methodology gives superior control performance over the widely applied cascade PID-PID control scheme...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} track the carrier phases of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals in signal {{degraded}} environments, a dual antenna joint carrier tracking loop is proposed and evaluated. This proposed tracking loop processes inputs from two antennas, namely the master antenna and the slave antenna. The master antenna captures signals in open-sky environments, while the slave antenna capture signals in degraded environments. In this architecture, a Phase Lock Loop (PLL) is adopted as a master loop {{to track the}} carrier phase of the open-sky signals. The Doppler frequency estimated by this master loop is utilized to assist weak carrier tracking in the <b>slave</b> <b>loop.</b> As both antennas experience similar signal dynamics due to satellite motion and clock frequency variations, a much narrower loop bandwidth and possibly a longer coherent integration can be adopted to track the weak signals in slave channels, by utilizing the Doppler aid from master channels. PLL tracking performance {{is affected by the}} satellite/user dynamics, clock instability, and thermal noise. In this paper, their impacts on the proposed phase tracking loop are analyzed and verified by both simulation and field data. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed loop structure can track degraded signals (i. e., 18 dB-Hz) with a very narrow loop bandwidth (i. e., 0. 5 Hz) and a TCXO clock...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we show that}} the {{traditional}} methods of analyzing cascade control (based on series or parallel input/output relationships) {{should not be used}} when the primary and secondary processes are coupled, and the process is open-loop unstable. The connection between cascade control and traditional state feedback control is studied. In addition, we develop a cascade control system methodology which incorporates a specified inner-loop controller in the outer-loop controller design. This cascade control design procedure is compared to a conventional cascade control design procedure and to a noncascade control strategy. Key Words.

40|$|The Swiss Light Source (SLS) has in {{the order}} of 500 magnet power {{supplies}} (PS) installed, ranging from from 3 A/ 20 V four-quadrant PS to a 950 A/ 1000 V two-quadrant 3 Hz PS. All magnet PS have a local digital controller for a digital regulation loop and a 5 MHz optical point-to-point link to the VME level. The PS controller is running a pulse width/pulse repetition regulation scheme, optional with multiple <b>slave</b> regulation <b>loops.</b> Many internal regulation parameters and controller diagnostics are readable by the control system. Industry Pack modules with standard VME carrier cards are used as VME hardware interface with the high control density of eight links per VME card.

40|$|Phonological {{similarity}} {{effects were}} used to assess the role of acoustic coding in verbal complex span, a processing-plus-storage measure found to correlate significantly with aspects of complex cognition. Three experiments demonstrated consistent effects of phonological simi-larity on listening span. These effects appeared relatively insensitive to manipulations of task materials (Experiment 1) and differences in processing task demands (Experiments 2 and 3). The results were interpreted as reflecting a significant role for the phonological loop in sup-porting verbal complex span and a multicomponent view of working memory, as tapped by these tests. Phonological similarity did not significantly interact with aspects of the tasks varied across Experiments 1 to 3, suggesting a relative robustness of the effect. However, variation in the phonological similarity effect sizes across Experiments 1 to 3 supports the suggestion that task demands and characteristics have the potential to disrupt the phonological similarity effect and, by implication, the reliance on a phonological code. Baddeley and Hitch’s (1974) tripartite working memory framework has been applied to many accounts of cognitive processes that require the short-term retention and manipula-tion of information. The original framework comprised two <b>slave</b> systems—the phonologi-cal <b>loop</b> and visuo-spatial scratch pad—and a limited capacity processor—the centra...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an intelligent control approach for {{air handling unit}} (AHU) which {{is an integral part}} of heat, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system. In the past years various control design for HVAC have been proposed as this system remarkably consumes very high energy. But most of the proposed designs were focused on the control flow of heat-transfer medium such as chilled or heated water while the importance of the efficient mixture of outdoor and indoor enthalpies is sometimes ignored. These enthalpies invariably determine the best strategy to overcome thermal load in a controlled environment to satisfy human comfort, hence a control design strategy must be able to efficiently regulate the flow and mixture of outdoor and indoor enthalpies by a proper control of AHU dampers and fans. This approach requires sensors to measure temperature and relative humidity of both outdoor and indoor environments. However, unpredictable level of disturbances coming from many sources including heat generated by occupants, electrical items and air leaking and the continuous changes of outdoor enthalpy makes it difficult to model the process. Consequently, conventional controllers are not suitable, hence the use of fuzzy logic controller (FLC) is proposed in this paper. This proposed controller operates in a master and <b>slave</b> control <b>loop</b> so as to control the AHU dampers and fans with adjustable output membership function whilst at the same time a scaling-factor method is used to drive the master operation. To implement the proposed system, a small scale prototype has been designed and fabricated. This prototype is an AHU model which consists of ductwork, temperature and humidity sensors, dampers, air cooling and heating systems. A small box is used as a conditioning space in which a room temperature is measured. The control algorithm is programmed using National Instrument (NI) LabVIEW and executed using NI FieldPoint. Experimental results reveal that proper control of AHU dampers and fans is an effective and practical means to satisfy human comfort with minimum energy consumption.

40|$|The natural {{ability of}} {{filamentous}} fungi to synthesize, glycosylate, and secrete {{high levels of}} protein products has made them potentially attractive hosts for heterologous protein production. Advances in fungal genetics enabled the expression of several high value proteins in filamentous fungi. Particularly the genus, Aspergillus {{has proven to be}} potentially useful for the expression of eukaryotic gene products. This thesis pertains to the optimization of recombinant protein production by the fungal host, Aspergillus niger. The target recombinant protein of interest is hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL). This protein encoded in the genome resulting in relatively stable gene construct; however, it is subject to extracellular protease attack. The objective of the proposed research is the development and application of engineering methodology for the analysis and optimization of a fungal bioprocess for recombinant protein production. The underlying hypothesis is that a significant improvement of target protein productivity is achievable by using appropriate optimization techniques. To accomplish this, during the first phase of this study a statistically based experimental method was used to systematically elucidate the effect of medium components (starch, peptone, ammonium sulfate, yeast extract, and CaCl₂. 2 H₂O) on hen egg white lysozyme production by Aspergillus niger HEWL WT- 13 - 16. A 2 ⁵⁻¹ fractional factorial design augmented with center points revealed that peptone, starch, and ammonium sulfate were the most significant factors, whereas the other medium components were not important within the levels tested. Then, the method of steepest ascent was employed to approach the proximity of optimum. This task was followed by a central composite design to develop a response surface for medium optimization. The optimum medium composition for lysozyme production was found to be: starch 34 g/L, peptone 34 g/L, ammonium sulfate 11. 9 g/L, yeast extract 0. 5 g/L, and CaCl₂. 2 H₂O 0. 5 g/L. This medium was projected to produce theoretically 212 mg/L lysozyme. Using this optimized medium, an experimentally observed maximum lysozyme concentration of 209 ± 18 mg/L verified the applied methodology. A second optimization approach was based on metabolic flux analysis (MFA). A comprehensive metabolic network comprising three intracellular compartments (cytoplasm, mitochondrion and peroxisome) was developed for Aspergillus niger. The metabolic flux network included carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism in both anabolic and catabolic reactions. According to experimental observations, the time course of fermentation was divided into five phases, each with unique physiological properties. The network was used to form a set of linear algebraic equations based on the stoichiometry of the reactions by assuming pseudo-steady state for intracellular metabolites. The metabolic flux model consists of 137 metabolites and 287 processes, of which 181 represent biochemical conversions and 106 represent transport processes between the different compartments and the extracellular environment. In addition, due to the physiological evidence some biochemical reactions considered to be active only in one direction. Linear programming was used for optimizing of the specific growth rate as the objective function in combination with 37 measured input and output fluxes of the key metabolites to evaluate corresponding intracellular flux distributions throughout the batch fermentations. The general applicability of the methodology was evaluated by establishing commonality to optimize recombinant HEWL production. The proposed model was able to predict correctly the specific growth rate, oxygen uptake rate, and carbon dioxide evolution rate with good precision. The results of the metabolic flux and sensitivity analysis were employed for medium design. Growth was biphasic; glucose was utilized initially as the carbon source and was followed by its oxidation product, gluconate, later. Logarithmic sensitivity analysis revealed that the addition of proline, alanine and glutamate benefited growth in defined media. The experimental observations and flux analysis showed that tyrosine was a potential candidate for biomass production improvement. The two amino acids, namely proline and tyrosine benefited biomass production during the initial growth phases. Glutamate and alanine were particularly important during the latter stages of the batch process. A series of growth studies were conducted with the identified amino acids added in the medium. In these preliminary nutritional experiments the contribution to growth enhancement was 46 % for proline, 23 % for glutamate, and 22 % for tyrosine. Model predictions were further verified by conducting batch and fed-batch fermentations in a 7 - liter bioreactor. The programmed addition of four amino acids (proline, glutamate, alanine, and tyrosine) according to a predetermined schedule resulted in a 44 % improvement in biomass and 41 % improvement in recombinant protein production. The experiments also confirmed the model prediction that extra amount of amino acids besides the identified ones would not significantly enhance biomass and the recombinant protein production. A computer-based control system was developed for the on-line monitoring and control of the major state variables (e. g., temperature, pH, and DO) during the time course of fermentation. The graphical programming environment, LabVIEW was used to acquire and integrate these variables in a supervisor computer. The temperature of the bioreactor during sterilization and fermentation was controlled using a cascade methodology. The controller parameters of the master and <b>slave</b> <b>loops</b> were determined experimentally to yield a smooth response with minimum overshoot of both the bioreactor and jacket temperatures. The program scheduled various required steps in an established order during the fermentation. This feature of the software guarantees that every necessary operation will be met. The graphical representation of the process is displayed on the screen and helps the user to follow the process and perform the required adjustments. Furthermore, different variables can be observed simultaneously and saved in text or spreadsheet files for further analysis...|$|R
