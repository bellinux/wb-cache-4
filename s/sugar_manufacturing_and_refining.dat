40|$|Trade union {{recognition}} for the Swaziland <b>Sugar</b> <b>Manufacturing</b> <b>and</b> <b>Refining</b> Industry 1982 - 1992 {{from a human}} resources management perspective). This study has attempted to consider the complexities of labour relations and industrial conflict within a developing African country. A major case study was followed. The research covers the ten year period 1982 - 1992 and follows the interaction and conflict between management Representative of employers and trade union leaders in Swaziland's major strategic industry. The specific conflict issue was that of recognition by the employers of a trade union, as the sole collective bargaining agent for workers within the <b>sugar</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>and</b> <b>refining</b> industry. Both parties were constrained within the parameters of legislation more applicable to an industrialised nation than to a third world state. Interaction between participants in an industrial work place occurs within the ambience of the wider society but values, norms and ideologies are reflected individually and in the various sub-systems of that society. A prevailing ideology however pervades the total socio-economic and political system ordered through a framework of rules and regulations determined {{and approved by the}} governing elite. In one developing country, Swaziland, the authoritative framework for the industrial relations sub-system during the years 1982 - 1992, was based upon the Democratic Socialist ideology of Western industrially developed states, as catalogued and promoted by the International Labour Organisation (ILO). Organised labour's values and norms were identical to I. L. O. norms but the rank and file of the worker collectives in Swaziland rarely understood the concepts involved. Employers and managers marginally identified with the concepts but did not fully support their operationalisation. The hypothesis is that it was the impact of the respective values and norms of the employers and their representatives and union leaders which determined the processing of the conflict. The values and norms of industrialised society encapsulated in industrial relations concepts and the notion of collective bargaining embodied in Swaziland's labour legislation contributed little to the resolution of conflict over {{union recognition}}. Collective bargaining with its inherent compromise approach provided a model for conflict management and a forum for the exercise of attitudes and actions arising from individual and group values and norms; it did not provide guidelines for conflict resolution. Overt conflict was avoided but the underlying differences and the basic conflict itself were reinforced and prolonged for ten years. The study concludes with the suggestion that a locally developed conflict resolution strategy providing a structure for a consensus approach might have resulted in a long term collaborative environment for industrial relations. Such an environment could lead to economic stability and capital investment of benefit to employers and employees and of vital concern to a developing society...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} (catalytic) steam {{reforming}} of bio-liquids {{for the production}} of synthesis gas. Glycerol, both crude from the biodiesel <b>manufacturing</b> <b>and</b> <b>refined,</b> <b>and</b> pyrolysis oil are tested as bio-based feedstocks. Liquid bio-based feeds could be preferred over inhomogeneous fibrous solid biomass because of their logistic advantages, better mineral balance, and better processability. Especially the ease of pressurization, which is required for large scale synthesis gas production, is another clear advantage of liquid biomass. In addition to this, liquefied biomass contains less contaminants than the biomass from which it originates which will be beneficial with respect to catalyst poisoning. The proposed steam reforming process is a hybrid one (HSR - Hybrid Steam Reforming) in which the bio-liquids are co-reformed with a fossil feed such as natural gas or naphtha. In this thesis, methane as a model compound for natural gas is investigated. By co-reforming, implying partnering with the current fossil-based industry, use is made of the existing infrastructure and markets which should help the introduction of bio-based synthesis gas. At the level of the chemistry, co-feeding may minimize the adverse characteristics of the bio-liquid as has been observed for cofeeding upgraded pyrolysis oil with long residue in a micro Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) unit...|$|R

40|$|Throughout the {{industrial}} processes of sheet metal <b>manufacturing</b> <b>and</b> <b>refining,</b> shear cutting {{is widely used}} for its speed and cost advantages over competing cutting methods. Industrial shears may include some force measurement possibilities, but the force is most likely influenced by friction losses between shear tool and the point of measurement, and are in general not showing the actual force applied to the sheet. Well defined shears and accurate measurements of force and shear tool position are important for understanding the influence of shear parameters. Accurate experimental data are also necessary for calibration of numerical shear models. Here, a dedicated laboratory set-up with well defined geometry and movement in the shear, and high measurability in terms of force and geometry is designed, built and verified. Parameters important to the shear process are studied with perturbation analysis techniques and requirements on input parameter accuracy are formulated to meet experimental output demands. Input parameters in shearing are mostly geometric parameters, but also material properties and contact conditions. Based on the accuracy requirements, a symmetric experiment with internal balancing of forces is constructed to avoid guides and corresponding friction losses. Finally, the experimental procedure is validated through shearing of a medium grade steel. With the obtained experimental set-up performance, force changes as result of changes in studied input parameters are distinguishable down {{to a level of}} 1 %...|$|R
