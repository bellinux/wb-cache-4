40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} the relative contribution of left ventricular (LV) geometric remodeling and of morphological and functional myocardial changes in rats with induced supravalvar aortic stenosis (SAS), {{in the transition}} from compensated hypertrophy to congestive heart failure (CHF). Methods: Twenty one weeks after induction of SAS, the rats were classified as controls (CG, n= 13), without congestive heart failure (SG, n= 11), or with congestive heart failure (SG-HF, n= 12). All groups were evaluated with echocardiographic, hemodynamic and morphological study of the myocardium. Results: Twenty one weeks after SAS: mass index (SG-HF>SG>CG, pCG, pSG>CG, pSG>CG, pSG>CG, pSG>CG, p< 0. 05). In the SG-HF group, LV geometric remodeling was characterized by {{a significant increase in}} dimensions and relative thickness of the normal wall (excentric remodeling), whereas the <b>SG</b> <b>group</b> presented a concentric remodeling.

40|$|AIM: To {{describe}} a new surgical technique {{and evaluate the}} early results of segmental gastrectomy (SG) with modified D 2 lymph node (LN) dissection for early gastric cancer (EGC). METHODS: Fourteen patients with EGC underwent SG with modified D 2 dissection from 2006 to 2008. Their operative results and postoperative courses were {{compared with those of}} 17 patients who had distal gastrectomy (DG) for EGC during the same period. RESULTS: Operating time, blood loss, and hospital stay were similar between the 2 groups. Postoperative complications developed significantly more frequently in the DG group than in the <b>SG</b> <b>group.</b> Mean number of dissected LNs per each station in the <b>SG</b> <b>group</b> was comparable with that in the DG group. Postoperative recovery of body weight was significantly better in the <b>SG</b> <b>group</b> than in the DG group. The incidence of reflux esophagitis and gastritis after surgery was less frequent in the <b>SG</b> <b>group</b> than in the DG <b>group.</b> CONCLUSION: <b>SG</b> with modified D 2 LN dissection may be a new function-preserving gastrectomy that is feasible for treatment of EGC with possible LN involvement...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Obesity has {{recently}} {{become a major}} health problem, and researchers have been directed to work toward the development of surgical techniques, with new mediators playing {{an important role in}} nutrition. Gastric plication (GP) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) have become popular recently. These are widely used techniques in bariatric surgery. Objectives: In this study, we aimed to compare the efficiency of SG and GP techniques on rats. Methods: Wistar-Hannover rats (n= 18) were divided into three equal <b>groups,</b> namely <b>SG,</b> GP, and control. Blood samples were taken before the operation and on the 30 th day after the operation. The weights of all rats were recorded both on first day and the 30 th day after the operation. Serum gastrin, ghrelin, and leptin levels were also measured on the same days. For histopathological examination, gastrectomy was performed after the animals were sacrificed. Results: Average weight loss was 10 % for the <b>SG</b> <b>group</b> and 6. 5 % for the GP group. One month after the operations, the decrease in the ghrelin and leptin levels of GP and <b>SG</b> <b>groups</b> was significant compared with the levels of the control group. Gastrin levels of the <b>SG</b> <b>group</b> increased significantly compared with those of the control group. Histopathological examination revealed that there was significant decrease in the ghrelin and leptin levels of the GP and <b>SG</b> <b>groups</b> compared with those of the control group. Foveolar hyperplasia (FH), cystic glandular dilatation, and fibrosis were significantly higher in the GP and <b>SG</b> <b>groups</b> compared with the control group. Conclusion: Although GP is not as effective as SG in terms of weight loss, it provides the same effectiveness in decreasing ghrelin and leptin levels.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate the effect of feed restriction and re-alimentation on the onset of puberty and IGF status in peripubertal male calves and to compare the radioimmunoassay (RIA) and western ligand blotting (WLB) methods for bovine IGFBP- 2. Twelve prepubertal 290 d-old Belgian Blue bulls (mean weight: +/- 290 kg) were randomly assigned in three groups: a control group (NG; n = 4) receiving a classic fattening diet to induce "normal" growth (1. 48 kg/d), a feed restricted group (RG; n = 4) to obtain reduced growth (0. 50 kg/d) and, a severely restricted group (SG; n = 4) to nearly stop growth (0. 08 kg/d). The feed restriction period was maintained over a period of 114 d. After the period of differential feeding, all animals received the control feed regime over a period of 100 d. Blood samples were collected at fortnightly intervals. Circulating IGF-I was measured by RIA whereas plasma IGFBPs was evaluated by WLB; IGFBP- 2 was additionally quantified by RIA procedure. At the beginning of the trial, IGF-I levels were low (< 100 ng/ml) and similar in the three groups in accordance with prepubertal status. In the NG group, a progressive rise in IGF-I was observed from Day 42 to Day 142 whereas in the RG and <b>SG</b> <b>groups,</b> IGF-I levels did not change until the experimental restriction period ended. The delay of the rise in plasma IGF-I was longer for the <b>SG</b> <b>group,</b> IGF-I remained low until 2 wk {{after the end of the}} period of restricted feeding. Surprisingly, although differences were detected for IGF-I levels between the three groups, the IGFBP- 2 and - 3 data, evaluated by WLB could only discriminate between NG and <b>SG</b> <b>group</b> and not between NG and RG. However, by using a RIA method, an IGFBP- 2 decrease was observed in the NG group coincident with increasing IGF-I levels. For both RG and <b>SG</b> <b>groups,</b> IGFBP- 2 levels remained high throughout the feed restriction period whereas plasma IGFBP- 2 levels declined upon feeding in both groups. During this feed restriction period, IGFBP- 2 was significantly lower in NG than in RG or <b>SG</b> <b>groups.</b> Moreover, <b>SG</b> <b>group</b> animals had higher levels in plasma IGFBP- 2 than RG animals. In conclusion, puberty is characterized by developmental changes in plasma IGF-I and IGFBPs that were altered by feed restriction. Moreover, RIA evaluation of plasma IGFBP- 2 is able to better reflect group differences than WLB. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Twenty-two subjects {{were placed in the}} experimental group with silicone gel sheeting (SGS) applied 24 h per day for 6 months while all subjects were taught to massage the scar daily for 15 min serving as the control intervention. Scar assessments were conducted regularly to measure the changes in thickness, pigmentation, vascularity, pliability, itchiness and pain. Results: Two-way repeated ANOVA showed a significant difference between MT group and <b>SGS</b> <b>group</b> on scar thickness. The post hoc comparison analysis showed that the difference was significant at the post- 2 -month (p = 0. 008) and post- 6 -month (p < 0. 001) intervention. The <b>SGS</b> <b>group</b> also showed changes in pigmentation which resembled normal skin but no statistical significance was found. Pain, itchiness and pliability were also improved after intervention. Conclusion: This study indicated that silicone gel sheeting (Cica-Care) was effective to reduce thickness, pain, itchiness and pliability of the severe hypertrophic scar among the Chinese population. The moisturization effect of the tough and hard scar might contribute to the reduction of the skin thickness after 6 month's intervention. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|E
40|$|Background Assessment of {{pre-test}} {{probability of}} pulmonary embolism (PE) and prognostic stratification are two widely recommended {{steps in the}} management of patients with suspected PE. Some items of the Geneva prediction rule may have a prognostic value. We analyzed whether the initial probability assessed by the Geneva rule was associated with the outcome of patients with PE. Methods In a post-hoc analysis of a multicenter trial including 1, 693 patients with suspected PE, the all-cause death or readmission rates during the 3 -month follow-up of patients with confirmed PE were analyzed. PE probability group was prospectively assessed by the revised Geneva score (RGS). Similar analyses were made with the a posteriori-calculated simplified Geneva score (SGS). Results PE was confirmed in 357 patients and 21 (5. 9 %) died during the 3 -month follow-up. The mortality rate differed significantly with the initial RGS group, as with the <b>SGS</b> <b>group.</b> For the RGS, the mortality increased from 0 % (95 % Confidence Interval: [0 - 5. 4 %]) in the low-probability group to 14. 3 % (95 % CI: [6. 3 - 28. 2 %]) in the high-probability group, and for the SGS, from 0 % (95 % CI: [0 - 5. 4 %] to 17. 9 % (95 % CI: [7. 4 - 36 %]). Readmission occurred in 58 out of the 352 patients with complete information on readmission (16. 5 %). No significant change of readmission rate was found among the RGS or SGS groups.

METHODS: Twenty-four rats were randomized into three groups: normal chow (control), high fat diet (HD) and high fat diet with sleeve gastrectomy (SG). After surgery, the HD and <b>SG</b> <b>groups</b> were fed a high fat diet. Animals were sacrificed and plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels were determined. LOX- 1 protein and LOX- 1 mRNA expression was also measured. Aortas were stained with Nile red to visualize adipose tissue. RESULT: Body weights {{were higher in the}} HD group compared to the other groups. HDL levels in control, HD, and <b>SG</b> <b>groups</b> were 32. 9 1; 6. 2 mg/dL, 43. 4 1; 4. 0 mg/dL and 37. 5 1; 4. 3 mg/dL, respectively.

OBJECTIVES: To compare Dutch (NL <b>group)</b> and Singaporean (<b>SG</b> <b>group)</b> children with psoriasis with the aim of studying the characteristics of juvenile psoriasis and to highlight similarities and differences between these different ethnic groups. METHODS: Data were collected from 207 patients younger than 18 years diagnosed with psoriasis from Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, the Netherlands and the National Skin Centre, Singapore. RESULTS: A striking difference in familial distribution was found, with more Dutch children having an affected family member (73. 3 % vs. 13. 6 %). Presence of itch and triggering factors were more common among Dutch children (80 % vs. 14. 2 % and 33. 3 % vs. 7. 4 %, respectively). However, both groups shared similar triggering factors like stress and infections. Other similarities included mean age at presentation (NL group 11. 3 years; <b>SG</b> <b>group</b> 14. 1 years) and gender ratio (NL group, M/F 1 : 1. 1; <b>SG</b> <b>group,</b> M/F 1 : 1. 4). Plaque psoriasis was the most common type in both cohorts while guttate and pustular psoriasis were rare. In both groups, the head, followed by the limbs, was the most common site involved. Similar proportions of children in both countries had nail involvement and psoriatic arthritis was rare. CONCLUSIONS: The disparity in familial distribution may point to genetic differences between the two groups.

40|$|ABSTRACT Uterine {{adenosine}} triphosphatase (ATPase) was measured {{to determine if}} its activity was related to shell quality. In the first experiment, 32 Strain 1 and 25 Strain 4 White Leghorn hens were used. Each strain contained a group that laid high and a group that laid low specific gravity (SG) eggs. Hens were killed 12 hr after an oviposition. Eggs with a partially formed shell were removed for evaluation, and uterine mucosal ATPase was measured. In the second experi-ment, 37 hens from Strain 1 were treated in the same way. It {{was found that the}} uterine ATPase required Mg 2 + for maximal activity and was partially inhibited by Ca 2 +. In Experiment 1, Strain 1 had more ATPase activity than Strain 4 (P<. 01), but no differences were observed between <b>SG</b> <b>groups.</b> Strain 1 had heavier partial shell plus membranes than Strain 4 and the high <b>SG</b> <b>group</b> laid eggs with more partial shell plus membrane than the low <b>SG</b> <b>group</b> (P<. 05). In Experiment 2, activity of uterine ATPase was not correlated with shell strength traits of eggs collected over a 5 -day period prior to day of kill or quantity of shell of partially shelled eggs obtained from the uterus. However, shell weight, and to some extent mem-brane weight, of partially shelled eggs were correlated (P<. 05) with shell strength of eggs laid over the 5 -day period. It was concluded that at 12 hr after oviposition, uterine ATPase activity was not related to shell quality but that layers of eggs with heavy shells already had deposited more shell than layers of eggs with light shells...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify the {{viewpoint}} of a well-experienced baseball coach when evaluating batting skills using kinematics indices. Method: First, three baseball coaches evaluated sixteen baseball players in their own teams. The players were divided subjectively into a first superior (FG) group and a second superior (<b>SG)</b> <b>group</b> according to batting ability. Next, the hitting motion of all sixteen players was captured using a VICON system (9 cameras, 250 Hz). We measured the speed of the batted and pitched ball, or the timing of release by the pitcher, using three synchronized high-speed cameras (250 Hz). From these kinematics data, we calculated several kinematics indices for each batter, focusing especially on the indices for motion of the lower extremities and trunk. In contrast, a well-experienced expert coach who had never met these players evaluated the hitting motion of each player using only motion films without the above kinematics indices, and similarly divided them into FG and SG. The evaluation of fourteen players agreed between the team coaches and the expert coach. The FG and the SG each comprised seven players. We analyzed these fourteen players using the kinematics indices, and clarified objectively the differences in hitting motion between the two groups. Results & Conclusions: The speed of swing, batted ball speed and physical index were approximately the same in the two groups. However, players in the FG group showed a significantly longer distance of center of gravity migration in step than those in the <b>SG</b> <b>group.</b> This might have been attributable to the hip abduction movement on the pivot side on the basis of kinematics indices (p< 0. 05). Moreover, players in the FG group took more time in step, and swung in a shorter time after landing on the stepped foot, relative to the players in the <b>SG</b> <b>group</b> (p< 0. 05). These results suggest that the well-experienced expert coaches paid particular attention to the above hitting motion rather than the speed of swing, batted ball speed and physical index as coaching points...|$|R

30|$|MDSBA {{framework}} splits data recursively {{to create}} three dependent stages of MapReduce processes. Stage one aims to produce Gi {{groups for the}} whole dataset with one Pig command only, which filters each data record based on its class attribute, as described in Definition 1. The number of the produced Gi groups relies {{on the number of}} sensitive class values. For instance, Table  3 contains four values of sensitive attribute (Cancer); these are {no positive histology, Positive histology, Positive microscopic confirm, and Positive laboratory test}. The four values create four groups of Gi = {G 0,G 1,G 2,G 3 }. Each group is stored in a separate HDFS folder. Stage two reprocesses G groups in parallel, to categorize data records between wholly or partly equivalent or between SG, and SSG. According to definitions 2 and 3, the <b>SG</b> <b>groups</b> denote the equivalent Q-ID group, while the SSG groups denote Semi-equivalent <b>group.</b> The <b>SG</b> <b>groups</b> are equivalent, so anonymization is skipped, and data is stored in an output directory. The third stage’s input is derived from the second stage’s output, so SSG groups are stored in an input directory waiting for stage three. The process starts by reading SSG groups and abstracting the non-equivalent groups, denoted by NG. Both of NG and SSG are anonymized by using user defined function Java program.|$|R

Though the beneficial effect of SG on Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus is {{less than that of}} RYGB, it is perceived to have a lower complication rate. The {{purpose of this study was}} to quantify the complication rates between of SG and RYGB in a severely obese diabetic population. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study that included all diabetic patients undergoing RYGB and SG at an academic medical center from January 1, 2011 to July 1, 2015. Patients were followed at 6 week, 6 month, 1 year, 2 year, and 3 year postoperatively. Outpatient and emergency visits were identified in the EMR system. Continuous data was analyzed using Student T tests and discrete data was analyzed using Fisher’s Exact Test. We defined early complications as those occurring within 30 days postoperatively, and late complications as those after 30 days. Results: A total of 96 patients underwent RYGB and 89 underwent <b>SG.</b> The <b>groups</b> were concurrent and similar with regards to preoperative demographic factors such as age, gender, Hgb-A 1 c, HOMA 2 parameters, excess body weight, BMI, and diabetic medication use. In terms of early complications, the rate of hemorrhage requiring transfusion was higher in the <b>SG</b> <b>group</b> compared to RYGB (10. 1 % vs. 3. 1 %, p= 0. 073). Postoperative length of stay was lower in the <b>SG</b> <b>group</b> (m= 1. 7 d vs. m= 2 d, p= 0. 02), but the early readmission rate was also higher in the <b>SG</b> <b>group</b> (7. 9 % vs. 2. 1 %, p= 0. 09). For late postoperative complications, there were 4 anastomotic ulcer perforations and one case of internal hernia in the RYGB group. There were 6 late postoperative reoperations in the RYGB group (6 % vs. 0 %, p= 0. 03). In addition, 13 patients underwent 16 total upper endoscopies in the RYGB group (13. 5 % vs. 0 %, p= 0. 0002). The cumulative rate of early and late interventions was higher in the RYGB group (20 % vs. 3. 4 %, p= 0. 0005). Conclusions: While the rate of early postoperative complication is similar between SG and RYGB, the need for late intervention is higher after RYGB. The cumulative need for reintervention (early and late) is higher after RYGB. This may explain the shift from Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass to Sleeve Gastrectomy {{as the most}} commonly performed bariatric intervention...|$|R
40|$|Background. Myocardial {{infarction}} (MI) is {{the main}} cause of global mortality and morbidity despite the development of therapeutic approaches. ShenZhuGuanXin granules (SG) have been shown to possess cardioprotective effects against coronary heart disease (CHD). However, little is known about its specific mechanism. The present study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effect of SG in cardiac dysfunction and to demonstrate whether SG can promote myocardium angiogenesis by establishing a rat model of myocardial infarction with left anterior descending ligating. Methods and Results. Three days after MI, rats were randomly divided into six groups: sham group (sham), MI group (MI), MI + low dose <b>SG</b> (SG-L) <b>group,</b> MI + middle dose <b>SG</b> (SG-M) <b>group,</b> MI + high dose <b>SG</b> (SG-H) <b>group,</b> and MI + compound Danshen dropping pills (CDDP) group as a positive control. Four weeks after administration, rats underwent hemodynamics and echocardiography study. Ventricle tissues were processed for histology and immunohistochemistry studies. Compared with MI <b>group,</b> <b>SG</b> treatment dose-dependently improved cardiac hemodynamic function, attenuated infarct size, increased microvessel density, and increased the expression of PECAM- 1 /CD 31 and VEGF. Conclusions. SG dose-dependently improved cardiac hemodynamic function and attenuated infarct size by promoting angiogenesis through upregulating PECAM- 1 /CD 31 and VEGF expression...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} beneficial effects of a modified prescription of Sutaehwan named Sutaehwan-Gami (SG), created by adding Rhizoma dioscoreae and Carthami semen to Sutaehwan, on menopausal symptoms. Methods To evaluate the estrogenic effect of SG, we first examined estrogen receptor (ER) activation by SG treatment in breast adenocarcinoma cells and confirmed the estrogenic effect of SG in vivo ovariectomized rats. The animals were randomized into four groups: Sham operated group (Sham), saline treated ovariectomized <b>group</b> (OVX), <b>SG</b> treated <b>group</b> (<b>SG)</b> and raloxifene treated group (RLX). Animals were provided with SG at a dose of 500 mg/kg bw/day and RLX at a dose of 5. 4 mg/kg bw/day with standard rat pellets for 3 months. Results SG significantly increased ERα phosphorylation, and its downstream effectors, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and protein kinase B (Akt) phosphorylation in breast adenocarcinoma cells. Treatment with SG reversed ovariectomy-induced uterine weight reduction and weight gain. Decreases in the levels of GOT and GPT were observed in the <b>SG</b> <b>group.</b> The significantly reduced E 2 β level in OVX rats was raised by treatment with SG. Moreover, SG significantly increased the phosphorylation levels of ERK and Akt in the uterus. Conclusion Taken together, these data indicate that SG has phytoestrogen-like properties through ERK and Akt activation, implying {{that it could be}} protective and beneficial for the management of menopausal symptoms. </p...|$|R
50|$|Orosomucoid and antitrypsin migrate {{together}} but orosmucoid stains poorly so alpha 1 antitrypsin (AAT) constitutes {{most of the}} alpha-1 band. Alpha-1 antitrypsin has an <b>SG</b> <b>group</b> and thiol compounds may be bound to the protein altering their mobility. A decreased band {{is seen in the}} deficiency state. It is decreased in the nephrotic syndrome and absence could indicate possible alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. This eventually leads to emphysema from unregulated neutrophil elastase activity in the lung tissue. The alpha-1 fraction does not disappear in alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, however, because other proteins, including alpha-lipoprotein and orosomucoid, also migrate there. As a positive acute phase reactant, AAT is increased in acute inflammation.|$|R
40|$|Depression is {{a problem}} among college {{students}} in China. Yet the use of preventative group cognitive-behavioral (CB) intervention is rare. One hundred and eighty Chinese college students who were identified as being at risk for depression {{were randomly assigned to}} three groups: 1) a brief group cognitive–behavioral (CB) intervention, 2) a supportive <b>group</b> (<b>SG)</b> intervention, and 3) a wait-list control condition. The Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and the Chinese College Student Adjustment Scale (CCSAS) were administered at pre-test, post-test, and six-month follow-up. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) conducted among the three groups revealed that the CB group demonstrated significantly less increase in measures of primary symptoms of anxiety and depression than the wait-list controls at post-test and six-month follow-up. The prevention effect of the <b>SG</b> <b>group</b> was significant only at the six-month follow-up. CB participants also showed significantly greater improvements in social adjustment than did SG participants and controls at the post-test and six-month follow-up...|$|R

Methods: The electronic databases Cochrane and PubMed (updated on April 10, 2016) were searched for randomized controlled trials comparing TG with SG as surgical procedures for distal gastric cancer. Five outcome variables were analyzed, including postoperative complications, anastomotic fistula rate, hospital mortality rate, mortality rate of recurrence (the patient’s death {{is caused by the}} recurrence of gastric cancer, rather than caused by other diseases), and 5 -year survival rate. Random or fixed effect model was used to perform this meta-analysis. Results: Six trials, including 573 cases treated with TG and 791 cases treated with SG, were included. Compared with patients in the <b>SG</b> <b>group,</b> patients in the TG group did not show a higher rate of postoperative complications (odds ratio [OR]: 1. 46, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 71 – 3. 03, P= 0. 30). However, patients in the TG group showed a significantly higher rate of anastomotic fistula than patients in the <b>SG</b> <b>group</b> (OR: 3. 78, 95 % CI: 1. 97 – 7. 27, P< 0. 0001). Hospital mortality rate, which was analyzed in four trials, including 510 TG versus 729 SG patients, showed {{no significant difference between the}} two groups (OR: 1. 80, 95 % CI: 0. 85 – 3. 78, P= 0. 12). Importantly, there was no significant difference in the 5 -year survival between the two groups (OR: 0. 68, 95 % CI: 0. 39 – 1. 19, P= 0. 18). Mortality rate of recurrence, which was also analyzed in three trials, including 396 TG versus 407 SG patients, showed a significantly higher rate in the TG group (OR: 0. 07, 95 % CI: 0. 01 – 0. 13, P= 0. 03). Conclusion: This meta-analysis demonstrated that postoperative complications, hospital mortality rate, and 5 -year survival rate in TG patients was similar to the <b>SG</b> <b>group.</b> Furthermore, <b>SG</b> was associated with significantly fewer anastomotic fistula and lower mortality rate of recurrence compared with TG. However, lower mortality rate of recurrence was probably related to the criteria of these two procedures.
