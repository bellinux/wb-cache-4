40|$|This paper builds upon a {{foundational}} paper (under review) which {{explores the}} rudiments of the quantum perspective of learning. The quantum perspective of learning uses the principles of exchange theory or borrowed theory {{from the field of}} quantum holism pioneered by quantum physicist David Bohm (1971, 1973) to understand learning in a new way. Bohm proposes that everything exists as wholes, rather than as parts, and that everything is connected. Similarly, the quantum perspective of learning proposes that individuals learn in holistic ways as they interact with temporal and in infinitely extending virtual worlds. Further, according to the quantum perspective of learning, learners have infinite potential. In this paper, the quantum perspective of learning is examined utilizing a combination of <b>Schunk’s</b> (1991) and Ertmer and Newby’s (1993) definitive questions for aligning learning theory with instructional design. These seven definitive questions focus on how learning happens, influential factors in learning, the role of memory, transfer of knowledge, modalities of learning that can best explain the quantum perspective of learning, applicable assumptions, and a discussion of how instruction can be organized to optimize learning. Examples of strategies that facilitate the quantum perspective of learning are provided...|$|R
40|$|English {{language}} learners (ELLs) represent an increasing population in U. S. public schools. Research {{reports from the}} past two decades suggest a persistent reading underachievement for ELLs. Academic vocabulary knowledge, due to its frequent use in academic texts, contributes significantly to ELL children’s English language development, reading comprehension, and general academic achievement. However, a gap of vocabulary knowledge exists between ELLs and their mainstream peers. One potential approach to address this issue is to help ELLs become mastery independent and proactive word learners. This study examined the effect of a researcher-led self-regulated vocabulary intervention on word knowledge, reading comprehension, and self-regulated learning in social studies for upper elementary ELLs. Self-regulatory word-learning strategies were guided by Michael Graves’ (2006) discussion of task-specific word learning strategies, and by Barry Zimmerman and Dale <b>Schunk’s</b> (2000) self-regulated learning theory from a social cognitive perspective. Specifically, the intervention instruction involved (1) task-specific cognitive strategies including morphological analysis and contextual analysis (i. e., how to use word parts and context clues to learn words), and (2) metacognitive strategies including goal-setting and monitoring (i. e., set goals and monitor their word learning and reading comprehension). A single-case experimental design was conducted with multiple-baseline design across subjects with 9 ELL children for 16 sessions, 3 sessions per week, and about 30 minutes per session. ...|$|R

40|$|To {{rationalize}} {{the relatively}} high investment that industrial automation systems entail, {{research in the field}} of intelligent machines should target high value functions such as fettling, die-finishing, deburring, and fixtureless manufacturing. For achieving this goal, past work has concentrated on force control algorithms at the system level with limited focus on performance expansion at the actuator level. We present a comprehensive literature review on robot force control, including algorithms, specialized actuators, and robot control software. A robot force control testbed was developed using <b>Schunk's</b> PowerCube 6 -DOF Arm and a six-axis ATI force/torque sensor. Using parameter identification experiments, manipulator module inertias and the motor torque constant were estimated. Experiments were conducted to study the practical issues involved in implementing stable contact transitions and programmable endpoint impedance. Applications to human augmentation, virtual fixtures, and teleoperation are discussed. These experiments are used as a vehicle to understand the performance improvement achievable at the actuator level. The approach at UTRRG has been to maximize the choices within the actuator to enhance its intelligence. Drawing on this 20 -year research history in electromechanical actuator architecture, we propose a new concept that mixes two inputs, distinct in their velocity ratios, within the same dual actuator called a Force/Motion Actuator (FMA). Detailed kinematic and dynamic models of this dual actuator are developed. The actuator performance is evaluated using simulations with an output velocity specification and resolving input trajectories using a minimum-norm solution. It is shown that a design choice of 14 : 1 motion scaling between the two inputs results in good sensitivity to output force disturbances without compromising velocity tracking performance.

30|$|The {{main purpose}} of the study was to develop and {{validate}} a self-report scale that could be used to evaluate self-regulated learning skills of university students (age 18 or above) in Turkey. As pointed out by Winne and Perry (2000 : 542), self-report questionnaires are “… the most frequently used protocol for measuring SRL, perhaps because they are relatively easy to design, administer, and score…”. Self-report scale studies (e.g. Self-Regulatory Learning Inventory, SRLI of Lindner et al. 1996; Motivational Strategies for Learning Questionnaire, MSLQ of Pintrich and De Groot 1990; Pintrich et al. 1991; Self-Regulatory Learning Interview Schedule, SRLIS of Zimmerman and Martinez-Pons 1986; and Self-Regulated Learning Skill Inventory, SRLSI of Heo 1998) so far have focused on self-regulated learning skills of students at secondary and college level. Additionally, those scale studies have different frameworks; one scale consists of only cognitive and metacognitive learning strategies, while another one encompasses cognitive and metacognitive learning strategies and limited number of motivational dimensions involved in learning. Even there are some adaptation studies of original scales and questionnaires (Büyüköztürk et al. 2004) in Turkey. The authors thought of a need to handle more thoroughly the cognitive and metacognitive learning strategies together with the related motivational dimensions. Additionally the authors believed in the necessity of developing a scale that represented the self-regulatory skills of Turkish students, a scale custom to Turkish learners and their learning traditions. This is not an adaptation study, yet the framework was derived as a result of extensive review of related studies in literature. Since the authors thought that the construct of self-regulation could not be independent of motivation in learning or vice versa, they decided to form the scale of two sections or sub-scales: self-regulatory skills and motivation. This structure is in line with Pintrich, Zimmerman and <b>Schunk’s</b> notion of self-regulation.|$|R
40|$|Research question: Post-traumatic stress {{disorders}} among children in Kirkuk in Northern Iraq—How does {{the war and}} post conflict affect the children’s academic learning at school? This is the main research question for this thesis. Kirkuk is well known as the oil city in Iraq. The original history of the city goes back to 2400 BC, when the city was {{the capital of the}} kingdom of Gutium. Gutium was also the name of the Kurdish people at the time. Kirkuk has been a conflict area throughout history with a current population of about 902, 019 (2007) comprised of Kurds, Arabs, and Turkmens. The non-ending conflict is about whether Kirkuk is Kurdish, Arabic, or Turkmens. The main purpose of this research is to encourage a greater understanding of how traumatic experience affects school children and their learning. The focus will be specific traumatic experiences connected to war and conflict areas, with Kirkuk as the research stage. The purpose of this thesis is to examine how PTSD affects academic learning among children. Learning and PTSD theories have been presented, followed by interpretation and reflection and analysis, {{in order to be able}} to respond to the theme. Methodology/ Literature The methodology in this thesis is case study, based on relevant theories and qualitative in depth interviews. The reason I chose this method is that the qualitative method focuses on a few devices, provides a broad description, and says “a lot of little,” and this thesis may later lead to a boarder research based on quantitative researches. Also, because PTSD affects individuals in different ways, I therefore find it interesting to base research on case studies. The respondents’ interview results are analyzed and studied carefully based on the theories and some existing previous researches. The findings have been both presented as case stories during chapter five and analyzed during chapter six. Both older and newer literatures have been used to discuss the theme. Dale H. <b>Schunk’s</b> (2008) relevance learning theories have been presented among them; Bandura’s social cognitive learning, conditioning theories, cognitive information processing theories and further PTSD theories have been presented with focus on DSM-IV. The focus has been on discussing how experiences lead to changes and what that means for learning. I have also used two previous researches; one survey done by Brit Oppedal, Karoline B. Seglem, and Laila Jensen (2009), a survey of young refugees in Norway about traumatic experience and its effect, and Broberg, Dyregrov and Lilled (2005), who researched on individuals exposed to a fair accident in Sweden. They linked school dropout with the trauma event. Further, I have presented Horowitz’s (1986) theory of stress response that was one of the earliest theories in this area. The theory focused on the fact that the traumatic experience shook the individual’s personality. Results/main conclusions: Learning is a result of experiences that lead to change and further lead to permanent changes in behaviour. PTSD theories have shown that trauma events change behaviour in individuals and in many cases lead to disorders. However, not all trauma experiences will lead to chronic PTSD. It depends on the degree of the trauma event, age, environment, and whether the trauma is repeated. Horowitz, in his theory of stress responses, focused on the fact that the traumatized individual swung between two extremes: between the need to slide away to protect themselves against being overwhelmed by the traumatic memories and the need to get an opportunity to express and work through the experience. The main findings in this thesis are that trauma experiences may lead to disorders, such as flashbacks, nightmares, and arousal. Newer researches have shown a correlation between trauma experiences and learning difficulties, and they refer to the fact that individuals that suffer from trauma events are disturbed by nightmares and flashbacks; as a result of that, they develop sleeping difficulties that result in concentration problems during the day. The respondents that have been presented individually as case stories during chapter five all indicate a form of suffering from trauma events, and it also has been linked to their academic learning. Two of the three respondents had to drop out of school the year they were exposed to the trauma event and still struggle with schoolwork. All three respondents explain that they have difficulties concentrating and suffer from flashbacks. The main conclusion here is that, based on the theories that have been presented and the research results in this thesis, PTSD may lead to learning difficulties on the basis of various factors, and it is necessary for clinic help to be provided to stop the development of chronic PTSD. Further research that focuses on the relationship between PTSD and learning is important to develop good clinical support tools for children and to assist them at an early age so that they do not grow up with the trauma disorders. Trauma experiences, like other experiences, change the individual’s personality. That may lead to learning difficulties, lower confidence, and the individual forming a negative image of their life and their environment. I hope this thesis leads to further research on the theme...|$|R
