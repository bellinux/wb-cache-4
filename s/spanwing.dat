40|$|THE BIOLOGY AND POPULATION DYNAMICS OF THE LEAPING GREY MULLET (L. SALIENS) WERESTUDIED IN THE MESSOLOGHI-ETOLIKO LAGOON. MOST OF THE MORPHOMETRIC CHARACTERS SHOW ALLOMETRIC GROWTH IN RELATION TO THE GROWTH OF TOTAL LENGTH. THE LARGEST ALTERNATIONS IN THE BODY PROPORTIONS HAPPEN DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF LIFE. THE INDIVIDUALS WHICH WERE COLLECTED BELONG TO THE AGE CLASSES 0 + - 6 +. THE DOMINATE AGE CLASSES IN THE FISH TRAPS WERE 2 + (52 %) AND 3 + (25 %). THE LEAPING GREY MULLET SHOW AN EXTENSIVE <b>SPANWING</b> PERIOD, FROM MAY TILL OCTOBER. THE GREATEST SPAWNING ACTIVITY TAKES PLACE FROM JULY TO SEPTEMBER. SPAWNING TAKES PLACE IN THE SEA, IN RELATIVE SHORT DISTANCES FROM THE POSITIONS OF THE FISH TRAPS, WHILE SPAWNING IN THE ETOLIKO LAGOON IS NOT EXCLUDED. THE FEMALES MATURE FOR THE FIRST TIME AT THE AGE OLDER THAN 3 YEARS, WHILE THE MALES AT AN AGEOLDER THAN 2 YEARS. THE NEW RECRUITS MAKE THEIR FIRST APPEARANCE ON THE SEASHORE REGIONS OF THE LAGOON IN JULY AND ARE OBSERVED UNTIL JUNUARY. IN THE LAGOON THE ABUNDANCE OF THE NEW RECRUITS ARE SMALLER, A FACT WHICH POSSIBLY RELATED WITH THE ABILITY TO ENTER IN RELATION TO SIZE. ...|$|E

Besides, as can be known from (9) and matrix theory that dimension matching matrices satisfy <b>span(w</b> [...]...|$|R
