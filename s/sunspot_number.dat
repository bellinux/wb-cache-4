5|$|At a {{distance}} of about eight light-minutes, the most frequently studied star is the Sun, a typical main-sequence dwarf star of stellar class G2 V, and about 4.6 billion years (Gyr) old. The Sun is not considered a variable star, but it does undergo periodic changes in activity known as the sunspot cycle. This is an 11-year oscillation in <b>sunspot</b> <b>number.</b> Sunspots are regions of lower-than- average temperatures that are associated with intense magnetic activity.|$|E
40|$|<b>Sunspot</b> <b>numbers</b> are {{important}} tracers of historical solar activity. They {{are important}} in the prediction of oncoming solar maximum, {{in the design of}} lifetimes of space assets, and in assessing the extent of solar-radiation impact on the space environment. <b>Sunspot</b> <b>numbers</b> were obtained visually from sunspot drawings. The availability of digital images from the US Air Force Improved Solar Optical Observing Network (ISOON) prototype telescope concurrent to observer-dependent <b>sunspot</b> <b>numbers</b> recorded at the National Solar Observatory (NSO) has provided a basis for comparing <b>sunspot</b> <b>numbers</b> determined from the two methods.

40|$|An {{eigenvector}} analysis {{procedure was}} used to analyze and develop algorithms for predicting <b>sunspot</b> <b>numbers.</b> The predictors in these algorithms consist of <b>sunspot</b> <b>numbers</b> from the preceding two solar cycles and magnetic index data from the preceding cycle. Predictions are presented for cycles 21 and 22. The sunspot activity for cycle 21 is predicted to remain below 100 until early 1980 when it will rapidly reach a peak of approximately 120. The two sigma accuracy on these estimates is approximately 20 <b>sunspot</b> <b>numbers</b> {{in the region of}} the peak and 10 <b>sunspot</b> <b>numbers</b> early and late in the cycle.

25|$|<b>Sunspot</b> <b>number</b> also {{changes over}} long periods. For example, from 1900 to the 1960s, the solar maxima trend of sunspot count was upwards; for the {{following}} decades it diminished. However, the Sun was last as active as this period over 8,000 years ago.|$|E
25|$|This period also {{occurred}} during the Dalton Minimum (a period of relatively low solar activity), specifically Solar Cycle 6, which ran from December 1810 to May 1823. May 1816 in particular had the lowest <b>sunspot</b> <b>number</b> (0.1) to date since record keeping on solar activity began. The lack of solar irradiance during this period was exacerbated by atmospheric opacity from volcanic dust.|$|E
25|$|Frequencies below {{approximately}} 10MHz (wavelengths {{longer than}} 30 meters), including broadcasts in the mediumwave and shortwave bands (and {{to some extent}} longwave), propagate most efficiently by skywave at night. Frequencies above 10MHz (wavelengths shorter than 30 meters) typically propagate most efficiently during the day.

40|$|Abstract. Sunspot {{drawings}} {{are provided}} {{on a regular}} basis at the Kanzelhöhe Solar Observatory, Austria, and the derived relative <b>sunspot</b> <b>numbers</b> are reported to the Sunspot Index Data Center in Brussels. From the daily sunspot drawings, we derived the northern, Rn, and southern, Rs, relative <b>sunspot</b> <b>numbers</b> for the time span 1975 – 2000. In order to accord with the International <b>Sunspot</b> <b>Numbers</b> Ri, the Rn and Rs have been normalized to the Ri, which ensures that the relation Rn+Rs = Ri is fulfilled. For validation, the derived Rn and Rs are compared to the international northern and southern relative <b>sunspot</b> <b>numbers,</b> which are available from 1992. The regression analysis performed for the period 1992 – 2000 reveals good agreement with the International hemispheric <b>Sunspot</b> <b>Numbers.</b> The monthly mean and the smoothed monthly mean hemispheric <b>Sunspot</b> <b>Numbers</b> are compiled into a catalogue. Based on the derived hemispheric <b>Sunspot</b> <b>Numbers,</b> we study the significance of N-S asymmetries and the rotational behavior separately for both hemispheres. We obtain that ∼ 60 % of the monthly N-S asymmetries are significant at a 95 % level, whereas the relative contributions of the northern and southern hemisphere are different for different cycles. From the analysis of power spectra and autocorrelation functions, we derive a rigid rotation with ∼ 27 days for the northern hemisphere, which can be followed for up to 15 periods. Contrary to that, the southern hemisphere reveals a dominant period of ∼ 28 days, whereas the autocorrelation is strongly attenuated after 3 periods. These findings suggest that the activity of the northern hemisphere is dominated by an active zone, whereas the southern activity is mainly dominated by individual long-lived sunspot groups...|$|R

40|$|To better {{understand}} long-term flare activity, {{we present a}} statistical study on soft X-ray flares from May 1976 to May 2008. It is found that the smoothed monthly peak fluxes of C-class, M-class, and X-class flares have a very noticeable time lag of 13, 8, and 8 months in cycle 21 respectively {{with respect to the}} smoothed monthly <b>sunspot</b> <b>numbers.</b> There is no time lag between the <b>sunspot</b> <b>numbers</b> and M-class flares in cycle 22. However, there is a one-month time lag for C-class flares and a one-month time lead for X-class flares with regard to <b>sunspot</b> <b>numbers</b> in cycle 22. For cycle 23, the smoothed monthly peak fluxes of C-class, M-class, and X-class flares have a very noticeable time lag of one month, 5 months, and 21 months respectively with respect to <b>sunspot</b> <b>numbers.</b> If we take the three types of flares together, the smoothed monthly peak fluxes of soft X-ray flares have a time lag of 9 months in cycle 21, no time lag in cycle 22 and a characteristic time lag of 5 months in cycle 23 with respect to the smoothed monthly <b>sunspot</b> <b>numbers.</b> Furthermore, the correlation coefficients of the smoothed monthly peak fluxes of M-class and X-class flares and the smoothed monthly <b>sunspot</b> <b>numbers</b> are higher in cycle 22 than those in cycles 21 and 23. The correlation coefficients between the three kinds of soft X-ray flares in cycle 22 are higher than those in cycles 21 and 23.

40|$|In {{a recent}} paper, Gupta et al., (2015), {{analyzed}} whether <b>sunspot</b> <b>numbers</b> cause global temperatures based on monthly data covering the period 1880 : 1 - 2013 : 9. The authors find that standard time domain Granger causality test fails {{to reject the}} null hypothesis that <b>sunspot</b> <b>numbers</b> does not cause global temperatures for both full and sub-samples, namely 1880 : 1 - 1936 : 2, 1936 : 3 - 1986 : 11 and 1986 : 12 - 2013 : 9 (identified based on tests of structural breaks). However, frequency domain causality test detects predictability for the full-sample at short (2 to 2. 6 months) cycle lengths, but not the sub-samples. But since, full-sample causality cannot be relied upon due to structural breaks, Gupta et al., (2015) concludes that the evidence of causality running from <b>sunspot</b> <b>numbers</b> to global temperatures is weak and inconclusive. Given {{the importance of the}} issue of global warming, our current paper aims to revisit this issue of whether <b>sunspot</b> <b>numbers</b> cause global temperatures, using the same data set and sub-samples used by Gupta et al., (2015), based on an nonparametric Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) -based causality test. Based on this test, we however, show that <b>sunspot</b> <b>numbers</b> have predictive ability for global temperatures for the three sub-samples, over and above the full-sample. Thus, generally speaking, our non-parametric SSA-based causality test outperformed both time domain and frequency domain causality tests and highlighted that <b>sunspot</b> <b>numbers</b> have always been important in predicting global temperatures.
