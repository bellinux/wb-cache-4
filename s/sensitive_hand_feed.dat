40|$|Abstract—The project {{deals with}} {{replacing}} <b>hand</b> <b>feed</b> of {{sliding table saw}} with automatic <b>feed.</b> Using common <b>hand</b> <b>feed</b> sliding table saws, smooth in-feed of material to cut could not be ensured. It negatively impacts quality of cut and surrounding surface structure. In this project, possibility of automation of sliding table feed is examined. Sliding table system must be modified concerning dimensions of the material to cut. Types of automated feeding systems of our design are reviewed and ordered also with regard to simplicity of implementation, work accuracy, safety, dust nuisance, reliability and costs. Keywords—saw, sliding table saw, automatic <b>feed,</b> <b>hand</b> <b>feed</b> I...|$|R

50|$|Between 10 am and 4 pm daily, {{visitors}} to the park may be photographed cuddling a koala, at an additional charge. Visitors are also permitted to touch and <b>hand</b> <b>feed</b> various other park animals.|$|R
50|$|Hand-reared budgies {{may take}} {{slightly}} longer to wean than parent-raised chicks. <b>Hand</b> <b>feeding</b> is not routinely done with budgerigars, {{due to their}} small size and because young parent raised birds can be readily tamed.|$|R
50|$|With <b>hand</b> <b>feeding</b> {{and hides}} {{situated}} {{all over the}} centre, visitors can get close {{to many of the}} ducks. These features, as well as the large number of habitats and different species, are common in WWT centres.|$|R
50|$|Specialty {{foods such}} as {{long-term}} sera holiday tabs, Koi Snacks for <b>hand</b> <b>feeding,</b> and Catfish chips for a nutritional treat based on natural textures {{are only a few}} of the novel additions that have combined nutrition with variety.|$|R
50|$|Fractures are {{problematic}} because chinchillas {{will want to}} sit on their hind legs and eat with their front paws, so many types of injuries will disturb their natural eating behavior. An animal with a cast may be comforted by <b>hand</b> <b>feeding.</b>|$|R
60|$|A duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright treble answer under <b>sensitive</b> <b>hands.</b> Brightly the keys, all twinkling, linked, all harpsichording, {{called to}} {{a voice to}} sing the strain of dewy morn, of youth, of love's leavetaking, life's, love's morn.|$|R
50|$|Both lakes are {{stocked with}} {{incredible}} goldfish {{that allow the}} visitor to literally <b>hand</b> <b>feed</b> fish pellets straight into their gaping mouths. Throwing some pellets into the water makes the water look like it begins to boil as the fish start to feed.|$|R
5000|$|Pond loaches are active, peaceful, {{and hardy}} fish that are {{sometimes}} used as starter fish in an aquarium. They can be [...] "friendly" [...] towards humans, allowing physical contact and <b>hand</b> <b>feeding.</b> They are extremely peaceful. They get along well with goldfish.|$|R

50|$|The GAU-18/A, is a {{lightweight}} {{variant of the}} M2/M3, and is used on the USAF's MH-53 Pave Low and HH-60 Pave Hawk helicopters. These weapons do not use the M2HB barrel, and are typically set up as left-hand feed, right-hand charging weapons, but on the HH-60 Pavehawks that use the EGMS (External Gun Mount System) the gun is isolated from the shooter by a recoil absorbing cradle and all weapons are set up as right hand charge but vary between left and right <b>hand</b> <b>feed</b> depending on what side of the aircraft it is on. A feed chute adapter {{is attached to the}} left or right <b>hand</b> <b>feed</b> pawl bracket allowing the weapon to receive ammunition through a feed chute system connected to externally mounted ammunition containers holding 600 rounds each.|$|R

50|$|The label's first {{release was}} the debut LP of Bree's band The Brunettes. Released October 2002, Holding <b>Hands,</b> <b>Feeding</b> Ducks was a joint release with EMI New Zealand. The album {{received}} a glowing review from Allmusic, {{as did the}} label's second release, The Brunette's 2003 The Boyracer EP. Bree produced both albums.|$|R

50|$|Giraffes {{were added}} in 1982 {{and a special}} {{encounter}} was introduced enabling visitors to <b>hand</b> <b>feed</b> the gentle giants. This experience {{remains one of the}} highlights of a Park visit today. Orana has contributed to the managed zoo-based programme and over 15 giraffes have been bred, most of which were transferred to other zoos.|$|R
50|$|The Gulf of Mexico tank {{is a large}} 120,000 gallon tank in the {{aquarium}} with two full grown Nurse sharks and Bonnet-head sharks. Other fish such as, Atlantic tarpon, porcupinefish, and a large Goliath grouper live in the tank. Periodically throughout the day, SCUBA Divers <b>hand</b> <b>feed</b> the sharks and fish for an audience.|$|R
50|$|They {{prefer to}} feed on live fish which they catch with their special technique, but will readily feed on other types of meat or leafy {{vegetables}} if offered. <b>Hand</b> <b>feeding</b> is dangerous. Extreme temperatures are known to affect the turtle's appetite and {{would result in the}} turtle refusing to feed until it has been remedied.|$|R

50|$|Assisted <b>feeding,</b> {{also called}} <b>hand</b> <b>feeding</b> or oral feeding, is {{the action of}} a person feeding another person could not {{otherwise}} feed themselves.

50|$|<b>Hand</b> <b>feeding</b> of cassowaries poses a big {{threat to}} their survival, because it lures them into {{suburban}} areas. There, the birds {{are more susceptible to}} vehicles and dogs. Contact with humans encourages cassowaries to take food from picnic tables. Feral pigs are a huge problem. They destroy nests and eggs but their worst effect is as competitors for food, which could be catastrophic for the cassowaries during lean times.|$|R
50|$|If {{machining}} depth cuts, the {{radial arm saw}} allows one to see the progress. With the (wood) clamped and using the arm (not <b>hand</b> <b>feeding,</b> which is also possible), the cuts are better machined and require no jig setup; the advantage is not widely needed however. Cutting full depth is less convenient, as the saw lowers into the table, cutting the table (often a wood table for that reason).|$|R
50|$|Some {{people find}} chickens' {{behaviour}} entertaining and educational {{and they are}} sometimes kept as pets. Chickens can be tamed by <b>hand</b> <b>feeding,</b> although roosters can sometimes become aggressive and noisy. Aggression may be curbed with proper handling. Some have advised against keeping them around very young children. Certain breeds, such as silkies and many bantam varieties, are generally docile and are often recommended as good pets around children with disabilities.|$|R
