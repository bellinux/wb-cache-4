40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was the {{production}} and characterization of gelatin-based films using hydrophobic plasticizers derived from citric acid and soy lecithin as emulsifier. The films were characterized as to their mechanic properties, permeability to water vapor, opacity, morphology and possible interactions using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Tensile strength values (TS) varied from 36 to 103 MPa, how-ever, the increase in the concentration of plasticizers (acetyltributyl citrate and tributyl citrate) reduced TS by 57 % and no relation was observed between plasticizer quantities and the elongation in the quantities tested. Permeability to water vapor varied between 0. 17 and 0. 34 (g mm/m(2) h kPa), slightly increasing with the increase in concentration of plasticizers. The effectiveness in the use of <b>soy</b> <b>lecithin</b> <b>emulsifier</b> in the homogenization between the compounds could be proven by microscopic observation using confocal laser microscopy.

40|$|In {{previous}} studies the authors obtained a phenolic freeze-dried extract from red-grape marc by hydroalcoholic extraction. Antioxidant {{properties of the}} extract could be maintained during long term storage, but the extract shows limited solubility both in aqueous and lipid systems. Since addition of the extract to hazelnut paste as natural additive to protect it against lipid oxidation improving its quality and shelf-life appears an interesting and profitable application, this study investigated the encapsulation of the extract into different nanoemulsion-based delivery systems. Three different delivery systems were fabricated at the nanoscale (around 200 nm) by high pressure homogenization for the encapsulation of the marc extracts. Formulation 1 was a sunflower-oil/water nanoemulsion with <b>soy</b> <b>lecithin</b> as <b>emulsifier.</b> Formulation 2 was a powder obtained by maltodextrin-assisted spray-drying of Formulation 1. Formulation 3 was an ethanol/solid-lipid nanoemulsion, produced by hot homogenization using <b>soy</b> <b>lecithin</b> as <b>emulsifier.</b> The original extract and its encapsulating formulations were homogenized into hazelnut paste at a concentration of 5000 ppm, resulting into different phenolics content, ranging from 1200 ppm for crude extract to less than 10 ppm for the delivery systems. An accelerated shelf-life test at 60 °C was carried out and peroxides value (PV) of the lipid phase was periodically analyzed (until 100 days) to verify the protective effect of the extracts against oxidation. Results showed the efficiency of nanoemulsion formulation in improving solubility of the extract into the hazelnut paste. Addition of the extract could significantly improve the paste shelf-life by inhibiting its oxidation. Improved dispersion of nanoemulsion also increased {{the efficiency of the}} phenolic compounds, reducing the amount of extract required for the potential production of a natural preservative agent...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{essential}} oil {{has been the}} subject matter of many investigations due to its eco-friendly and bio-degradable nature. Geranium oil is one of the various {{essential oil}}s that are used as mosquito repellent. However, stability is one of the issues related to essential oil fonnulations. Incorporation of essential oil in a control-release formulation could solve the problem and it also offers several advantages. In this work, a new delivery system for mosquito repellent based on the incorporation of geranium oil into solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) has been studied. The following has been employed for the production of geranium oil loaded solid lipid nanoparticles (GO-SLNs) : 5 - 15 % (w/w) stearic acid as the lipid, 0. 5 - 3 % (w/w) <b>soy</b> <b>lecithin</b> as the <b>emulsifier,</b> 0. 5 - 3 % (w/w) Tween 80 as the co-emulsifier, 5 - 20 % (w/w) dichloromethane also as the co-emulsifier and 8 % (w/w) geranium oil as the active ingredient. GO-SLNs were prepared using ultrasonicsolvent emulsification technique. GO-SLNS were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), photon cross correlation spectroscopy (PCCS), gel filtration and gas chromatography (GC). Results showed that the variation in the amount of ingredients affected geranium oil loading capacity and mean particle size. Increasing the concentrations of lipid, emulsifier and co-emulsifier resulted in the increase in the mean particle size from 46 nm to 114 nm. Geranium oil encapsulation efficiency (EE) was in the range of 92 - 99 % (w/w). Production of high quality SLNS loaded with geranium oil has been demonstrated...|$|R

Fifty-two Wistar rats were divided into 4 experimental groups: control (AIN- 93 diet), ethanol group (control diet plus a 20 % hydroalcoholic solution), ethanol + vitamin E group (addition of 0. 6 % vitamin E to the diet plus a 20 % hydroalcoholic solution); ethanol + <b>soy</b> <b>lecithin</b> group (addition of 5 % <b>soy</b> <b>lecithin</b> to the diet plus a 20 % hydroalcoholic solution). At the end of 4 weeks the animals were sacrificed. The results showed a significantly smaller number of animals (p < 0. 05) classified as having a low degree of steatosis in the ethanol + vitamin E group and ethanol + <b>soy</b> <b>lecithin</b> group compared to the ethanol group. In addition, the ethanol + <b>soy</b> <b>lecithin</b> group had a significantly lower concentration of hepatic fat (p < 0. 05) than the ethanol group.

40|$|Emulsions find {{a variety}} of {{applications}} in for example food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical preparations. In order to obtain emulsions with desired properties {{it is important to}} understand how different factors, such as the properties of the emulsifier and the emulsification procedure, impact the final emulsion properties. The studies performed in relation to this thesis have mainly been focused on the impact of the dispersed state of phospholipids on emulsification. Previous studies have indicated that larger structures are transported more rapidly to the interface during high-pressure homogenization and, thus, dominate the interfacial layer. Phospholipids are chosen as emulsifiers since they can be dispersed in different ways but would provide the same stabilization of the interface once they have adsorbed and spread. Three different phospholipid products from soy are used; phosphatidylcholine (PC), PC-enriched lecithin and deoiled <b>lecithin.</b> The <b>emulsifier</b> is either dispersed in the oil or in the aqueous phase as aggregates of different size. The aggregates are large lamellar structures, large vesicles or small vesicles. The vesicle size is studied by cryo TEM and asymmetrical flow-field flow fractionation. For PC-enriched <b>soy</b> <b>lecithin</b> and deoiled <b>soy</b> <b>lecithin</b> also the conformation as a function of vesicle size is studied. Emulsions are prepared with different phospholipid compositions and dispersed states. For soy-PC the smallest emulsion droplets are obtained with the emulsifier dispersed as small vesicles. Monolayer adsorption is observed for the vesicles whereas multilayer formation is indicated for the larger aggregates as well as when the emulsifier is dispersed in the oil. Hence, a larger area can be covered with the same amount of emulsifier when vesicles are used and this may explain the higher efficiency. For emulsions prepared with PC-enriched <b>soy</b> <b>lecithin</b> and deoiled <b>soy</b> <b>lecithin</b> the droplets are smallest with the emulsifier dispersed in the oil. These products contain some charged material and the observed differences are likely explained by electrostatic repulsion. When the ionic strength is increased the charged systems behave similar as soy-PC. The results show that the dispersion of the emulsifier may have a large impact on emulsification. Emulsions are often complex systems containing a mixture of emulsifiers and additives. Interactions between emulsifiers may affect emulsion properties. The interactions between hydrophobically modified starch and egg proteins, in solution and at the interface, are studied. Moreover, we often want to heat or freeze emulsions products. Freeze-thaw stability of mayonnaise-type oil-in-water emulsions is another topic that is treated in this thesis...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEmulsions {{inversion}} {{occurs in}} many industrial processes {{and may be}} influenced by the formulation conditions, composition and emulsification protocols.

Emulsions were prepared with different stirring rates, using <b>soy</b> <b>lecithin</b> and Tween 80, at 2 and 5 wt%. The aqueous phase was distilled water with 1 wt% NaCl and the oil phase was soy oil. These emulsions were analyzed by conductivity, stability, microscopy and rheology assays. The most stable emulsions presented inversion with a smaller amount of the external phase. Rheological analysis showed that, with a higher concentration of emulsifier, it is better to use Tween 80 when lower viscosity is desired, while <b>soy</b> <b>lecithin</b> is more appropriate for higher viscosity products. The oscillatory tests showed that while the emulsions prepared using Tween 80 exhibited concentrated solution behavior, those prepared with <b>soy</b> <b>lecithin</b> exhibited strong gel behavior...|$|R
