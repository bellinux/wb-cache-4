40|$|The {{issue of}} ECOWAS {{citizenship}} is intriguing and undeniably complex. The Protocol on the Definition of ECOWAS Citizenship includes other onerous requirements which the Protocol failed to clarify. This {{lack of clarity}} makes the requirements, superfluous. In this article, the authors have critically analyzed the pre-requisites for the acquisition of ECOWAS citizenship-highlighting the obvious incongruities. The paper argues {{in support of a}} regime whereby the requirements for ECOWAS citizenship are brought in tandem with the constitutional citizenship requirements of the various Member States. The article also discusses the problems related to the treatment of people by Member States {{in the wake of the}} spate of migration that ensued, after the introduction of “free movement”, and liability for <b>trans-border</b> <b>crimes</b> of individuals and corporate entities...|$|R

The organisation supports a Europe built on Conservative principles of an open market, individual and business opportunity and a responsible engagement in world affairs. CEG asserts that if a Conservative government is to have any chance of effectively tackling trans-national challenges including climate change, energy supplies, transport infrastructure, population shifts, common borders and free movement within, <b>trans-border</b> <b>crime,</b> terrorism, economic and financial turbulence, open markets and competition policy and security, then open, flexible working alliances with mainstream European colleagues are the only solution.|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} based on open source {{research}} into the scope of organized crime and terrorist activity in the Republic of Mexico during the period 1999 to 2002, {{and the extent of}} cooperation and possible overlap between criminal and terrorist activity in that country. The analyst examined those organized crime syndicates that direct their criminal activities at the United States, namely Mexican narcotics trafficking and human smuggling networks, as well as a range of smaller organizations that specialize in <b>trans-border</b> <b>crime.</b> The presence in Mexico of transnational criminal organizations, such as Russian and Asian organized crime, was also examined. In order to assess the extent of terrorist activity in Mexico, several of the country’s domestic guerrilla groups, as well as foreign terrorist organizations believed to have a presence in Mexico, are described. The report extensively cites from Spanish-language print media sources that contain coverage of criminal and terrorist organizations and their activities i...|$|R
40|$|The complex {{terrain of}} Nigeria’s borders and neglects of border {{settlements}} {{in terms of}} the provisions and availability of basic amenities; encouraged the frontier dwellers to cross the international boundary seeking for some of the basic necessities of life. This made them vulnerable of being attacked by aliens and terrorists; easily recruited and co-opted by criminals from either of the borders; compelled to engage or aid <b>trans-border</b> <b>crimes</b> as well as providing hiding place for some unscrupulous elements in the society or face the wrath of the syndicates and traffickers. This Library research established that, neglecting the border regions and the porosity of our international boundary has fuelled the current security challenges confronting the nation. The paper recommends the total checkmating of activities at the border region; provision of basic/necessary materials for the dwellers of border towns and the boosting of international collaboration by countries sharing the common border against illicit traffickers as the panacea for national security, socio-economic and political development...|$|R
40|$|<b>Trans-border</b> <b>crimes</b> {{and arms}} {{smuggling}} in the West African sub-region has {{in recent times}} {{been identified as a}} fundamental problem that requires concerted efforts by individuals, groups, organizations and governments to solve. Thus, we have national governments, regional organizations, the United Nations Organization and other non-governmental organizations making active efforts to stem smuggling of arms. This trend of event is quite understandable. The last decade had witnessed tremendous increase in the proliferation of arms across the West African sub-region. The arms were believed to be used to actualize certain socio-political objectives which in many cases become violent. The violence involved necessitated the smuggling of arms to actualize those objectives. While smuggling of arms had led to the availability of arms being possessed illegally, it has facilitated outright destruction of peace and security in Africa especially the West African sub-region. The availability of these small arms had made it easy for some countries to go to full scale war and in countries where there is no war; it is a common place that life is lived as if it is always in a state of war. Every person whether while staying in his home or moving about does so with the feeling that the next person to him is armed with a small weapon and about to kill him. Suddenly, the international community {{in the last two decades}} came to the realization of the havoc the smuggling/proliferation of small arms had done to mankind. It has suddenly been discovered that the biggest agent of destruction of human life is small weapon which are very cheap and easy to acquire and moved about. Human destruction is facilitated by small arms through violent ethnic/political/religious conflicts, kidnapping, armed robbery, assassination and cultism in the tertiary institutions. Consequently, an international Campaign was initiated through the United Nations Organization (UNO) by concerned countries to end the smuggling in arms. This research study attempts to examine the perception of trans-border communities to arms smuggling with specific focus on Nigeria-Benin Republic border, and how they can assist in tackling smuggling in arms across the borders.
