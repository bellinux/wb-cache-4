40|$|AbstractIntergovernmental organisations have {{developed}} into important sites of normative contestation where increasingly non-state actors participate. A common puzzle is however whether engaged non-state actors represent already strong and established interests {{or if they}} also bring forth marginalised voices. This concern raises the pertinent question of what views non-state actors actually represent and if this adds to the perspectives voiced by state actors. This paper examines the views held and voiced by state {{and a range of}} non-state participants at the United Nation's climate change conferences. Specifically, questions on what types of climate change solutions are favoured and to what extent these solutions are discussed are addressed. Through statistical analyses of questionnaire data and a content analysis of abstracts of <b>side-events</b> to the conferences, we find that while non-state actors help in broadening the discursive space, some perspectives remain marginalised. We conclude that while non-state actors represent a pluralising force, greater non-state actor participation in intergovernmental organisations is on its own unlikely to lead to democratic global governance...|$|E
40|$|This paper explores an {{emerging}} discourse at the UNFCCC level - the integrated landscape approach discourse, which brings new understandings {{of how to}} approach forests in a climate change nexus. Its proponents argue that forestry, agriculture and other land uses cannot be seen in isolation, but need to be integrated into a single management process. I apply argumentative discourse analysis (Hajer, 1995) {{to a series of}} documents, statements, observations and interviews to identify and analyze the power of this discourse in the UNFCCC and in particular on the reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) negotiations. The paper highlights the central arguments of its storylines, its main critique and identifies members of its discourse coalition. It also assesses its discursive power, and concludes that although storylines of the integrated landscape approach discourse may be well recognized in the UNFCCC, in particular at <b>side-events</b> (discourse structuration), it has yet to impose its logics and rationales in a profound way (discourse institutionalization) ...|$|E

40|$|IFPRI’s 2020 {{conference in}} May 2014 did {{generate}} {{a wide variety}} of short-term impacts, some larger than others, felt both at the level of individual conference participants and within the organizations that sent them to Addis, and last but not least within the organizing institutions. Most of these impacts took the form of accelerated learning and increased coordination across organizations, for project development and program advancement. Many of these impacts were expected to be durable rather than just temporary. By intent, the 2020 conference in Addis was designed to produce impacts large in number and variety, but not immediately visible to outsiders. The conference agenda was not focused on one issue, or even on a single grouping of issues. There was no push on the agenda toward a single goal. More than 140 speakers shared information and views regarding the resilience-building activities they were already engaged in, and multiple simultaneous parallel sessions and <b>side-events</b> provided a broad menu of choices for attendees to find one another, compare notes, and make plans, but the 2020 Conference did not immediately lead to any single headline-grabbing change.

40|$|Technology {{transfer}} {{is a central}} component in policies and action to prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Without creation and adoption of suitable environmentally sound technologies {{it will not be}} possible to follow the basic principles of sustainable development. Technology transfer was expected to be a major item at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Poznań, Poland, 1 – 12 December 2008, but was eclipsed by discussions on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation in Developing Countries. However, agreement was reached on a report from the Global Environment Facility called the ‘Poznań strategic programme on technology transfer’ outlining proposals to scale-up investment. At the meeting {{it was not possible to}} reach agreement on inclusion of carbon capture and storage technology under the clean development mechanism and other areas of unresolved discussion included intellectual property rights and revision of the principle of differentiated responsibility. <b>Side-events</b> to the main meeting provided two important indications of future directions.
