40|$|The International Space Station (ISS) {{has been}} {{designed}} as a laboratory for demonstrating technologies in a microgravity environment, benefitting exploration programs by reducing the overall risk of implementing such technologies in new spacecraft. At the beginning of fiscal year 2010, the ISS program manager requested that the amine-based, pressure-swing carbon dioxide and humidity absorption technology (designed by Hamilton Sundstrand, baselined for the ORION Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, and tested at the Johnson Space Center in relevant environments, including with humans, since 2005) be developed into a payload for ISS Utilization. In addition to evaluating the amine technology in a flight environment before the first launch of the ORION vehicle, the ISS program wanted to determine the capability of the amine technology to remove carbon dioxide from the ISS cabin environment at the metabolic rate of the full 6 -person crew. Because the amine technology vents the absorbed carbon dioxide and water vapor to space vacuum (open loop), additional hardware needed to be developed to minimize the amount of air and water resources lost overboard. Additionally, the payload system would be launched on two separate Space Shuttle flights, with {{the heart of the}} payload the <b>swingbed</b> <b>unit</b> itself launching a full year before the remainder of the payload. This paper discusses the project management and challenges of developing the amine swingbed payload in order to accomplish the technology objectives of both the open-loop ORION application as well as the closed-loop ISS application...|$|R

40|$|Controlling {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) and water (H 2 O) vapor {{concentrations}} {{in a space}} suit is critical to ensuring an astronauts safety, comfort, and capability to perform extra-vehicular activity (EVA) tasks. Historically, this has been accomplished using lithium hydroxide (LiOH) and metal oxide (MetOx) canisters. Lithium hydroxide is a consumable material that requires priming with water before it becomes effective at removing carbon dioxide. MetOx is regenerable through a power-intensive thermal cycle but is significantly heavier on a volume basis than LiOH. As an alternative, amine-based vacuum swing beds are under aggressive development for EVA applications. The vacuum <b>swing</b> <b>units</b> control atmospheric concentrations of both CO 2 and H 2 O through fully-regenerative process. The current concept, {{referred to as the}} rapid cycle amine (RCA), has resulted in numerous laboratory prototypes. Performance of these prototypes have been assessed experimentally and documented in previous reports. To support developmental e orts, a first principles model has also been established for the vacuum swing sorption technology. For the first time in several decades, a major re-design of Portable Life Support System (PLSS) for the extra-vehicular mobility unit (EMU) is underway. NASA at Johnson Space Center built and tested an integrated PLSS test bed of all subsystems under a variety of simulated EVA conditions of which the RCA prototype played a significant role. The efforts documented herein summarize RCA test performance and simulation results for single and variable metabolic rate experiments in an integrated context. In addition, a variety of off-nominal tests were performed to assess the capability of the RCA to function under challenging circumstances. Tests included high water production experiments, degraded vacuum regeneration, and deliberate valve/power failure and recovery...|$|R

However, due to the high investment costs, this technology is convenient for large sizes only.

Hydrogen production method is {{the main source of}} distinction between the various ammonia production routes. Most of the improvements in the technology regarding the ammonia synthesis were concerned with {{the hydrogen}} production step. Hydrogen can be produced by steam reforming, partial oxidation and water electrolysis. The bulk of the world ammonia production is based on steam reforming. The major hydrogen sources are natural gas, naphtha and coal. In this project different methods available for hydrogen separation from its source are analyzed and the best possible way to produce synthesis gas (which will form ammonia) from natural gas is found out. The number of reforming stages required for a plant capacity of 1500 tons per day of ammonia production is found out. The mass balance and energy balance calculations for the above said plant capacity is presented in this work. Then the conventional carbon dioxide removal process and methanation process are replaced by the advanced, economical pressure swing adsorption process. It was also found that two stages of shift converters required for this plant capacity.

40|$|Graduation date: 1980 Presentation date: 1979 - 11 - 30 This study {{compares the}} {{production}} rates and yarding costs of prebunching {{with a low}} investment skyline yarder and swinging with a larger skyline yarder to full-cycle thinning with the larger yarder The study analyzes two slackpulling techniques (manual and haulback assisted) and two carriages (a multi-span carriage and a clamping carriage) during the prebunching phase of the operation. The swing yarding employed a multi-span, clamping carriage requiring manual slackpulling. The full-cycle thinning employed a slackpulling carriage. All of the prebunch and <b>swing</b> <b>units</b> required multi-span skylines, while the full-cycle thinning units required single-span skylines. The study {{took place in a}} stand of young second-growth Douglas-fir and western hemlock with a mean volume of 6600 cubic feet per acre (30, 300 board feet per acre). The mean log size was 12. 3 cubic feet (55. 4 board feet). Maximum skyline yarding distances ranged from about 500 feet to 1100 feet, with lateral yarding distances up to 140 feet perpendicular to the corridor. The analysis indicates that the full-cycle thinning was significantly less costly than prebunching and swinging techniques. No significant differences were detected between the slackpulling techniques or carriage types used for prebunching. The average cost of prebunching and swinging was 46. 76 per cunit (103. 91 per MBF), while the average cost of full-cycle yarding was only 19. 14 per cunit (42. 53 per MBF). The average yarding costs increased linearly at a rate of 1. 70 per 100 feet of maximum yarding distance. Full-cycle thinning produced 3744 cubic feet per eight-hour day (16, 850 board feet per day) or 304 logs per day. Swinging produced 4305 cubic feet per eight-hour day (19, 370 board feet per day) or 350 logs per day, and prebunching produced 1882 cubic feet per eight-hour day (8470 board feet per day) or 153 logs per day. The combined production rate of prebunching and swinging was 1413 cubic feet per day (6360 board feet per day) or 115 logs per day. Prebunching production varied as a function of lateral distance and volume per acre removed in the thinning. Regression analysis was used to develop production equations which can be used to predict how each system would function over a similar range of conditions on other operations. The full-cycle thinning performed most consistently during the study. Both the prebunch and swing operations had a higher percentage of unexplained variation in the yarding cycles. The average delay-free yarding cycle for full-cycle thinning required 5. 08 minutes, with an average turn volume of 47. 4 cubic feet (213. 3 board feet). The average delay-free yarding cycle for swing yarding required 5. 01 minutes, with an average turn volume of 60. 1 cubic feet (270. 4 board feet). The average delay-free prebunching cycle was 2. 45 minutes, with an average turn volume for prebunching of 19. 1 cubic feet (86. 0 board feet). The prebunching operation was affected most seriously by delays, with only about 52 percent of the total time spent in delay-free productive yarding. Both the swing operation and the full-cycle thinning operated at about 75 percent delay-free productive yarding time. A parcel model, developed to analyze prebunching production, shows promise as a tool for analyzing time study data...|$|R
40|$|A light-weight, {{easy to use}} ground {{penetrating}} radar (GPR) {{system for}} tracking metal/non-metal pipes has been developed. A pre-production prototype instrument has been developed whose production cost {{and ease of use}} should fit important market niches. It is a portable tool which is swept {{back and forth like a}} metal detector and which indicates when it goes over a target (metal, plastic, concrete, etc.) and how deep it is. The innovation of real time target detection frees the user from having to interpret geophysical data and instead presents targets as dots on the screen. Target depth is also interpreted automatically, relieving the user of having to do migration analysis. In this way the user can simply walk around looking for targets and, by ''connecting the dots'' on the GPS screen, locate and follow pipes in real time. This is the first tool known to locate metal and non-metal pipes in real time and map their location. This prototype design is similar to a metal detector one might use at the beach since it involves sliding a lightweight antenna back and forth over the ground surface. The antenna is affixed to the end of an extension that is either clipped to or held by the user. This allows him to walk around in any direction, either looking for or following pipes with the antenna location being constantly recorded by the positioning system. Once a target appears on the screen, the user can locate by <b>swinging</b> the <b>unit</b> to align the cursor over the dot.
