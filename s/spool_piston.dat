40|$|In {{this study}} {{directional}} control valves being the elements of industrial hydraulic circuits have been examined. A viscous fluid leakage between the <b>spool</b> (<b>piston</b> of which the surfaces being machined parallel to each other) and the valve body has been obtained. It has been seen that the misalignment within the piston-cylinder system increases the fluid leakage. Analysis has been expanded to cover the conical spool surfaces. It was concluded that for reduced leakage (as far as possible) the misalignment, piston length {{and the value of}} surface coning should be selected properly. The study has been performed by non-dimensional parameters...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} a {{controller}} utilizing second order sliding modes, generally applicable for po-sition tracking control of electro-hydraulic valve-cylinder drives (VCD), is proposed. The proposed controller requires pressure measurements, {{and only the}} signs of the valve <b>spool</b> position and <b>piston</b> position- and velocity. The main objective is to introduce a control concept that provide for increased performance compared to linear controllers, {{in the presence of the}} inherent nonlinear nature character-izing such systems. To accomplish this task, a controller based on the twisting algorithm and knowl-edge of system gain variations is proposed. Results demonstrate strong robustness when subjected to parameter perturbations and that control chattering is eliminated...|$|R
