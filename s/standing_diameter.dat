40|$|Whether visceral obesity predicts {{coronary}} heart disease (CHD) risk above and beyond overall fatness remains unsettled. Moreover, whether the association between visceral obesity and CHD risk differs by sex, age, race, and overall fatness is poorly understood. The authors conducted a cohort study among 101, 765 adult members of Kaiser Permanente of Northern California who underwent multiphasic health checkups between 1965 and 1970. After a median of 12 years and adjustment for age, race, body mass index (BMI), educational level, smoking, alcohol consumption, and hormone replacement therapy (in women), the upper quartile of <b>standing</b> sagittal abdominal <b>diameter,</b> relative to the lowest quartile, {{was associated with a}} 1. 42 -fold increased hazard of CHD in men (95 % confidence interval: 1. 30, 1. 55) and a 1. 44 -fold increased hazard of CHD in women (95 % confidence interval: 1. 30, 1. 59). Further adjustment for metabolic mediators attenuated the association minimally. <b>Standing</b> sagittal abdominal <b>diameter</b> was a consistent predictor of CHD across racial groups but was more strongly associated with CHD in the younger age group. Joint consideration of BMI/standing sagittal abdominal diameter categories better discriminated risk of CHD compared with use of BMI alone. In conclusion, <b>standing</b> sagittal abdominal <b>diameter</b> was a strong predictor of CHD independently of BMI and added incremental CHD risk prediction at each level of BMI. abdominal fat; body mass index; cohort studies; coronary disease; obesit...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: High-grade gynaecomastia (Simon IIb and III) has tissue excess (skin excess, {{enlarged}} areola, and displaced nipple), {{which is}} best managed surgically; however, results of conventional breast reduction surgeries and liposuction {{is not very}} good. Aim of our study was to describe a combined technique to manage these problems to produce a good result. Material and Method: This was a 2 -year study among 12 patients of high grade gynaecomastia. Clinical and laboratory findings were normal. Pre-operatively in <b>standing</b> position, <b>diameter</b> of breast and areola, position of nipple, and amount of skin excess were marked. Under general anaesthesia, tumescent infiltration, circumareolar de-epithelisation of skin excess, and liposuction was completed. Redundant portion of the breast was sharply dissected and pulled out. Areola was fixed over pectoralis fascia at mid humerus level, just medial to the mid-clavicular line. Outer borders of the de-epithelised area were apposed by the purse-string effect of a subdermal suture, and further apposed by few half buried horizontal mattress sutures. Drains for 24 hour and compressive dressings for 6 weeks were used. Result: Mean age of presentation was 25. 8 year; emotional discomfort was the chief complaint. Among 12 patients, 10 patients had bilateral gynaecomastia and 8 patients had enlarged and displaced nipple-areola complex. Average hospital stay was 2. 41 days and recoveries were usually uneventful. Conclusion: The problem of tissue excess and tissue displacement in high grade gynaecomastia can be well managed by this combined circumareolar skin reduction and liposuction technique to achieve a scar-less flat male chest...|$|R
40|$|A {{new growth}} recipe for height {{maximization}} of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by thermal {{chemical vapor deposition}} is found using an ethylene purity of 99. 5 %. This new recipe yields fast growthrates with average growth heights of 1146 Âµm in 10 minutes of growth. The CNT forest growth is very uniform but also has tears in structures, bowed vertical growth, and rough sidewalls indicating a poor quality CNT forest. These poor features {{seem to be a}} result of the thickness of the iron catalyst layer. With a thicker catalyst layer, high quality CNT forests may potentially be grown using 99. 5 % pure ethylene with faster growth rates than the current standard growth recipe for CNTs using 99. 95 % pure ethylene. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are cylindrical fullerenes with properties which make them widely researched and ideal for applications in electronics and micro fabrication.

40|$|International audienceConsideration {{is given}} to a very {{specific}} interaction phenomenon that may occur in turbomachines due to radial rub between a bladed disk and surrounding casing. These two structures, featuring rotational periodicity and axi-symmetry respectively, share {{the same type of}} eigenshapes, also termed nd-nodal diameter traveling waves. Higher efficiency requirements leading to reduced clearance between blade-tips and casing together with the rotation of the blade disk increase the possibility of interaction between these traveling waves through direct contact. By definition, large amplitudes as well as structural failure may be expected. A very simple two-dimensional model of outer casing and bladed disk is introduced in order to predict the occurrence of such phenomenon in terms of rotational velocity. In order to consider traveling wave motions, each structure is represented by its two $n_d$-nodal <b>diameter</b> <b>standing</b> modes. Equations of motion are solved first using an explicit time integration scheme in conjunction with the Lagrange multiplier method which accounts for the contact constraints, and then by the Harmonic Balance Method. While both methods yield identical results that exhibit two distinct zones of completely different behaviours of the system, HBM is much less computationally expensive...|$|R
60|$|One {{very long}} summer day spent in roaming {{about in this}} endless wood, always on the watch, had for sole result, so far as {{anything}} out of the common goes, the spectacle of a hare sitting on a stump. The hare started up at a distance of over a hundred yards before me and rushed straight away at first, then turned, and ran on my left so as to get round to the side from which I had come. I stood still and watched him as he moved swiftly over the ground, seeing him not as a hare but as a dim brown object successively appearing, vanishing, and reappearing, behind and between the brown tree-trunks, until he had traced half a circle and was then suddenly lost to sight. Thinking that he had come to a stand I put my binocular on the spot where he had vanished, and saw him sitting on an old oak stump about thirty inches long. It was a round mossy stump, about eighteen inches in <b>diameter,</b> <b>standing</b> in a bed of brown dead leaves, with the rough brown trunks of other dwarf oak-trees on either side of it. The animal was sitting motionless, in profile, its ears erect, seeing me with one eye, and was like a carved figure of a hare set on a pedestal, and had a very striking appearance.|$|R
40|$|This is the authors' peer-reviewed final manuscript. The {{published}} {{version is}} copyrighted by Elsevier {{and can be}} found here: [URL] commercial thinning of young forests in the Pacific Northwest is currently promoted on public lands to accelerate the development of late-seral forest structure for the benefit of wildlife species such as northern spotted owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) and their prey, including the northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus). Attempts to measure the impact of commercial thinning on northern flying squirrels have mostly addressed short-term effects (2 â 5 years post-thinning) and the few published studies of longer-term results have been contradictory. We measured densities of northern flying squirrels 11 â 13 years after thinning of young (55 â 65 years) Douglas-fir forest stands in the Cascade Range of Oregon, as part of the Young Stand Thinning & Diversity Study. The study includes four replicate blocks, each consisting of an unthinned control stand and one stand each of the following thinning treatments: Heavy Thin; Light Thin; and Light Thin with Gaps. Thinning decreased density of northern flying squirrels, and squirrel densities were significantly lower in heavily thinned stands than in more lightly thinned stands. Regression analysis revealed a strong positive relationship of flying squirrel density with density of large (> 30 cm <b>diameter)</b> <b>standing</b> dead trees and a negative relationship with percent cover of low understory shrubs. Maintaining sufficient area and connectivity of dense, closed canopy forest is recommended as a strategy to assure that long-term goals of promoting late-seral structure do not conflict with short-term habitat requirements of this important species...|$|R
60|$|The {{captain had}} not made {{more than two or}} three strokes after {{speaking}} when his right hand struck against something hard, just below the surface of the water. He involuntarily grasped it. It was immovable, and it felt like a tree, a few inches in <b>diameter,</b> <b>standing</b> perpendicularly in the lake. Wondering what this could be, he took hold of it with his other hand, and finding that it supported him, he let his feet drop, when, to his surprise, he found that they rested on something with a rounded surface, and the idea instantly came into his mind that it was a submerged tree, the trunk lying horizontally, from which this upright branch projected. This might be as good a resting-place as the rock to which he had been going, and standing on it, with his head well out of the water, he turned to speak to Ralph. At that moment his feet slipped from the slimy object on which he stood, and he fell backward into the water, still grasping, however, his upright support. But this did not remain upright more than an instant, but yielded to his weight, and the end of it which he held went down with him. As he sank, the captain, in his first bewilderment, did not loosen his grasp upon what had been his support, and which still prevented him from sinking rapidly. But in a moment his senses came to him, he let go, and a few downward strokes brought him to the surface of the water. Then he struck out for the point of rock for which he had been aiming, and he was soon mounted upon it.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The aim of {{the study}} was to examine the anthro-pometric {{features}} and body composition of athletes practis-ing karate at a high and medium competitive level. Our study was carried out on a sample of 35 subjects practising karate and aged from 16. 0 to 32. 5 years. This sample was divided into two groups: group 1 (n= 14 elite athletes) and group 2 (n= 21 amateur athletes). Various anthropometric measurements were taken (weight, height both <b>standing</b> and sitting, <b>diameters,</b> circumferences and skinfold thickness) from which different anthropometric indices were calculat-ed (body mass index, Scelic and Grant indices, arm muscle circumference and area), and the somatotype was then deter-mined. The body composition of each subject was assessed using the skinfold technique and the Jackson-Pollock (J-P) and Sloan-Weir (S-W) equations. The two groups of athletes showed very similar measurements regarding anthropomet-ric characteristics. Only the Scelix index presented a signif-icantly different value in the two groups (49. 6 Â± 1. 3 for group 1 vs. 51. 1 Â± 1. 3 for group 2; p< 0. 01). Group 1 showed a mesomorphic-ectomorphic somatotype, while the amateur athletes presented a balanced mesomorphic type. Moreover, a lower percentage of fat mass was more frequent in the first group (J-P= 8. 1 Â± 2. 4 %; S-W= 8. 9 Â± 3. 3 %) than in the second one (J-P= 9. 8 Â± 1. 6 %; S-W= 11. 2 Â± 3. 7 %), although the differ-ences between the two groups were not significant. We con-clude that group 1 is characterized by a slightly prominent vertical development of the skeletal frame. This could be an anthropometric characteristic that is best suited to meet the specific functional requirements of this sport. Moreover, both groups of athletes are characterized by a low percent-age of fat mass, particularly the elite group...|$|R

Materials and methodsBetween 1 June 2003 and 30 June 2006, 128 patients (147 limbs) with varicose veins and reflux in the SSV on duplex ultrasound (US) examination were treated with a 980 -nm diode laser under US guidance. EVLA was performed using pulsed mode with a power of 10 W. The pulse duration (1. 5 â 3 s) was chosen to deliver a linear endovenous energy density (LEED) depending on the SSV diameter measured 1. 5 cm below the sapheno-popliteal junction (SPJ) with the patient <b>standing.</b> For SSV <b>diameters</b> between 2 and 4. 5 mm, the LEED applied was 50 Jcmâ 1. The LEED was 70 Jcmâ 1 for 4. 5 â 7 mm, 90 Jcmâ 1 for 7 â 10 mm. Patients were evaluated at 1 -week, 1 -month, 1 -year, 2 -year and 3 -year follow-up. ResultsThe initial technical success rate was 100 % in 147 patients. The SSV remained closed in 114 of 117 limbs (97 %) after 1 year, all of 61 limbs after 2 years and all of 30 limbs after 3 years. For the three SSVs where re-canalisation was observed, the diameter was greater than 9 mm. Major complications have not been detected and, in particular, there was no deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Ecchymoses were seen in 60 % with a median duration of 2 weeks. Temporary paraesthesia (mostly hypoaesthesia) was observed in 40 % of treated legs with a median duration of 2 weeks. The maximum duration did not exceed 4 weeks. No skin discolouration, superficial burn, thrombophlebitis or palpable induration was observed. ConclusionEVLA of the incompetent SSV with a 980 -nm diode laser {{appears to be an}} extremely safe technique. After successful treatment, there is a very low rate of re-canalisation of the SSV. Obliteration of the SSV was confirmed at 1 -, 2 - and 3 -year follow-up; this study suggests that this procedure will provide a lasting result...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background It is now {{recognized}} that large diameter myelinated afferents provide {{the primary source}} of lower limb proprioceptive information for maintaining an upright <b>standing</b> position. Small <b>diameter</b> afferents transmitting noxious stimuli, however, can also influence motor behaviors. Despite the possible influence of pain on motor behaviors, the effects of pain on the postural control system have not been well documented. Methods Two cutaneous heat stimulations (experiment 1 : non-noxious 40 degrees C; experiment 2 : noxious 45 degrees C) were applied bilaterally on the calves of the subject with two thermal grills to stimulate A delta and C warm receptors and nociceptors in order to examine their effects on postural stability. The non-noxious stimulation induced a gentle sensation of warmth and the noxious stimulation induced a perception of heat pain (visual analogue scores of 0 and 46 mm, respectively). For both experiments, ten healthy young adults were tested with and without heat stimulations of the lower limbs while standing upright on a force platform with eyes open, eyes closed and eyes closed with tendon co-vibration of tibialis anterior and triceps surae muscles. The center of pressure displacements were analyzed to examine how both stimulations affected the regulation of quiet standing and if the effects were exacerbated when vision was removed or ankle proprioception perturbed. Results The stimulation of the warm receptors (40 degrees C) did not induce any postural deterioration. With pain (45 degrees C), subjects showed a significant increase in standard deviation, range and mean velocity of postural oscillations as well as standard deviation of the center of pressure velocity. The effects of heat pain were exacerbated when subjects had both their eyes closed and ankle tendons vibrated (increased standard deviation of the center of pressure velocity and mean velocity of the center of pressure). Conclusions A non-noxious stimulation (40 degrees C) of the small diameter afferents is not a sufficiently intense sensory stimulation to alter the control of posture. A painful stimulation (45 degrees C) of the skin thermoreceptors, however, yielded a deterioration of the postural control system. The observed deteriorating effects of the combined stimulation of nociceptors and Ia afferents (when ankle tendons were vibrated) could result from the convergence of these afferents at the spinal level. This could certainly lead to the hypothesis that individuals suffering from lower limb pain present alterations of the postural control mechanisms; especially populations already at risk of falling (for example, frail elderly) or populations suffering from concomitant lower limb pain and sensory deficits (for example, diabetic polyneuropathy). </p...|$|R
40|$|Tree hollows {{provide an}} {{essential}} resource {{for a range}} of fauna, both in Australia and worldwide. There is concern over the future availability of the hollow resource in forests managed for timber harvesting because the time required for hollows to form is generally longer than the interval between harvest rotations. One of the strategies used to maintain the hollow resource is to retain specific trees to provide habitat for fauna. The overall aim of this thesis was to assess the tree hollow resource and its use by fauna in Tasmania, in order to inform the revision of management prescriptions for the conservation of the hollow resource in production forest areas. It was also to assess whether different prescriptions are required for different forest types. As part of this work, two methods of studying tree hollows were assessed for their accuracy and utility. To achieve these aims, 391 trees were examined before and after felling in forestry coupes throughout Tasmania. Data were collected on tree growth rings, hollow occurrence and whether the trees were being used by fauna. Estimates of hollow abundance on felled trees were corrected by the amount of tree that had been successfully surveyed. The trees were located at 39 sites in two broad forest types important to the Tasmanian forest industry, wet and dry Eucalyptus obliqua forest. The main factors associated with both hollow presence and abundance were the number of hollows observed on the <b>standing</b> tree, tree <b>diameter</b> and the amount of dead wood in the canopy. While tree age was strongly associated with hollow presence, it had less bearing on hollow abundance. An increase in the maximum size o f hollow found in a tree was related to greater tree senescence, as indicated by higher values of the afore-mentioned factors. Although significantly more hoiJows of all sizes were found in wet forest than drier forest, the age at which trees began to produce hollows was similar between the different forest types. Trees grow slightly more slowly in dry forest than wet, meaning that trees need to be slightly larger in wet forest before they are hollow-bearing. The difference in hollow abundance between the different forest types was largely a result of the history of logging in dry E. obliqua forest which has resulted in trees being smaller and younger in the areas studied. Although hollow-using fauna are a major component of vertebrate fauna in Tasmania, the number of hollow-using species found in Tasmania (42) is {{at the lower end of}} the range found in other areas of Australia. The rate at which trees were used by vertebrate fauna in Tasmania was also at the lower end of the scale found in other areas of Australia, with only 28...|$|R
