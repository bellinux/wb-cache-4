40|$|Haptics {{is not a}} term {{well known}} to the public. It {{is derived from the}} Greek word 3 psij-æ|, meaning “to come in contact with. ” As a {{scientific}} term it is traced to the German wordhaptik, as employed by M. Dessoir (1892) meaning “the study of touch and tactile sensations, especially as a means of communication ” (Oxford English Dictionary). Nowadays the term has expanded in scientific use beyond touch, embracing the breadth of the earlier Greek meaning — having to do with contact forces generally. In this meaning haptics includes not only cutaneous senses of force, which are distributed in time and space on the skin surface, but also the aggregations of skin contact forces to form vector resultants applied to the muscles and tendons and joints, <b>sensed</b> by different <b>receptors</b> in these structures. Thus haptics has come to include kinesthesis (sense of limb motion), and also proprioception (awareness of self, or sense of limb position relative to the body and gravity forces). Some researchers have used the term tactual to embrace cutaneous as well as muscle, tendon and joint sensing, restricting tactile to mean <b>skin</b> <b>senses</b> only, for example see Loomis and Lederman (1986). Others employ both tactual andtactile to mean <b>skin</b> <b>sensing.</b> The lay public’s understanding of the term touch only adds to the confusion, since to many people it means only contact <b>sensing</b> on the <b>skin,</b> but to others it includes as well what they feel in and with their limbs.

40|$|An {{important}} {{requirement for}} physiologic homeostasis is the detoxification and removal of endogenous hormones and xenobiotic compounds with biological activity. Much of the detoxification is performed by cytochrome P- 450 enzymes, {{many of which}} have broad substrate specificity and are inducible by hundreds of different compounds, including steroids. The ingestion of dietary steroids and lipids induces the same enzymes; therefore, they would appear to be integrated into a coordinated metabolic pathway. Instead of possessing hundreds of receptors, one for each inducing compound, we propose the existence of a few broad specificity, low-affinity <b>sensing</b> <b>receptors</b> that would monitor aggregate levels of inducers to trigger production of metabolizing enzymes. In support of this model, we have isolated a novel nuclear receptor, termed the steroid and xenobiotic receptor (SXR), which activates transcription in response to a diversity of natural and synthetic compounds. SXR forms a heterodimer with RXR that can bind to and induce transcription from response elements present in steroid-inducible cytochrome P- 450 genes and is expressed in tissues in which these catabolic enzymes are expressed. These results strongly support the steroid sensor hypothesis and suggest that broad specificity <b>sensing</b> <b>receptors</b> may represent a novel branch of the nuclear receptor superfamily...|$|R

The bone environment is believed to be favourable for the development of breast and prostate cancer's metastasis, due to bone-derived factors released during bone turnover that attract cancer cells, enabling metastasis and growth.

40|$|It {{is known}} that {{stimulation}} of thin nerve afferents can inhibit itch and pain and that the nociceptive systems have a detailed topographical organisation, with subsystems exhibiting specific excitatory and inhibitory receptive fields. On this basis, a new technique was developed, termed Cutaneous Field Stimulation (CFS), that electrically stimulates thin nerve fibers innervating specific skin fields. It was demonstrated that CFS has a robust and long lasting inhibitory effect on experimental itch. Furthermore, CFS selectively affected skin sensations mediated by thin nerve fibers (warmth, cold, itch, heat and mechanical pain). Notably, CFS exhibited a differential effect on different nociceptive <b>skin</b> <b>senses</b> with the strongest depression of C fiber mediated sensations. CFS for 6 - 10 min sufficed to evoke maximal inhibitory effect on most senses tested. The effects of CFS were independent of the frequency used (1 - 10 Hz per electrode). Finally, in a controlled and randomised clinical study, CFS induced profound relief of chronic itch lasting for more than 7 h. By contrast, conventional Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) had only marginal effects on the <b>skin</b> <b>senses</b> tested. CFS, possibly acting through spinal intermodality inhibitory interactions, is thus a powerful method to combat itch. The induction time, effective stimulation frequencies and long duration of the effects suggest underlying mechanisms {{similar to those of}} spinal long term depression (LTD) in animals. A hypothesis, "the modality interaction theory", is proposed to explain the differential inhibitory effects on different nociceptive modalities after thin fiber stimulation...|$|R

To examine the physiological functions of OGR 1, we generated conditional OGR 1 deficient mice by homologous recombination. OGR 1 deficient mice were viable and upon gross-inspection appeared normal. Consistent with in vitro studies showing that OGR 1 is involved in osteoclastogenesis, reduced osteoclasts were detected in OGR 1 deficient mice. A pH-dependent osteoclasts survival effect was also observed. However, overall abnormality in the bones of these animals was not observed. In addition, melanoma cell tumorigenesis was significantly inhibited in OGR 1 deficient mice. OGR 1 deficient mice in the mixed background produced significantly less peritoneal macrophages when stimulated with thioglycolate. These macrophages also showed altered extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) activation and nitric oxide (NO) production in response to lipopolysaccharide. OGR 1 -dependent pH responses assessed by cAMP production and cell survival in macrophages or brown fat cells were not observed, presumably due to the presence of other proton <b>sensing</b> <b>receptors</b> in these cells.
