It did, however, increase the number of officers at some of its missions by as much as 300 percent in 2009, and its consulate in Beirut resumed limited victim services, including the operation of a small safe house, mediation with domestic workers’ employers, and visitation of workers held in the detention center. In July and December 2009, the Ethiopian Consulate General secured the release and repatriation of 42 and 75 victims, respectively, who were being held in Lebanon for immigration violations. The government, however, showed only nascent signs of engaging destination country governments in an effort to improve protections for Ethiopian workers and obtain protective services for victims. Trafficked women returning to Ethiopia relied heavily on the few NGOs working with adult victims and psychological services provided by the government’s Emmanuel Mental Health Hospital. In 2009, the Addis Ababa City Administration provided land for use by 10 female victims repatriated from Djibouti as a site for a <b>self-help</b> <b>project.</b> In addition, the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Women’s and Children’s Affairs provided assistance to 75 victims repatriated from Lebanon in 2009, and assisted 12 victims repatriated from Israel with starting a cleaning business.

5000|$|After {{having been}} {{trained as a}} {{carpenter}} and a stage designer at the Landesbühne Niedersachsen in Wilhelmshaven, Germany, Fetting moved to Berlin and enrolled at the Berliner Hochschule für Bildende Künste, studying painting with Hans Jaenisch from 1972 through 1978. In his final year at the academy he, together with Anne Jud, Helmut Middendorf, Stefan Roloff, Berthold Schepers, Salomé and Bernd Zimmer founded the Galerie am Moritzplatz as a <b>self-help</b> <b>project,</b> {{in order to be}} able to exhibit their colorful figurative paintings in an art scene still dominated by minimalism, conceptual art, as well as Berlin Realism. The artists exhibiting at the gallery basically formed the core of the art movement that came to be known and rapidly achieved international acclaim as the „Neue Wilde“ (or „Junge Wilde“). Fetting at the time focused on Berlin cityscapes, portraits and figurative work (e.g."Van Gogh At The Wall"), painted in strong colors, and including many depictions of the Berlin Wall. In 1980 he participated in the exhibition Heftige Malerei“ in the Haus am Waldsee, Berlin, in 1981 he was part of the exhibition New Spirit in Painting organized by Christos M. Joachimides and Norman Rosenthal at the Royal Academy of Arts in London, and in 1982 he participated in the exhibition “Zeitgeist” in the Martin-Gropius-Bau, Berlin. After that he had many solo exhibitions in reputable galleries both in Europe and in the United States, such as Bruno Bischofberger, Mary Boone, Yvon Lambert, Daniel Templon, the Marlborough Gallery, New York, or Anthony dOffay. In early 1983, the Musée dArt Contemporain de Bordeaux presented an exhibition of collaborative works by Luciano Castelli, Fetting, and Salomé. The three artists also performed the concert »Opéra par hasard« in Bordeaux and Paris (Fetting on drums). [...] ). In 1984 he participated in the exhibitions Von hier aus - Zwei Monate neue deutsche Kunst in Düsseldorf and An International Survey of Recent Painting and Sculpture at the MoMA, New York, in 1988 he was part of the exhibition Refigured Painting - The German Image 1960-1988 at the Guggenheim Museum, New York. Between 1983 and 1994, Fetting spent part of his time in New York City, where he had already spent a year in 1978 on a grant from the DAAD. In his paintings, Fetting continued to explore the topic of the cityscape. Starting in 1984, while in New York, he experimented with assemblages of drift wood mounted on canvas and painted over. In 1986, he also started doing bronze sculptures. His best known work is the 3,40-meters-high sculpture of former West German chancellor Willy Brandt, placed in the foyer of the SPD party headquarters in Berlin, Germany. In 2003/04 he was included in the exhibition Obsessive Malerei - Ein Rückblick auf die Neuen Wilden.Recent highlights were the solo shows “Return of the Giants. Rainer Fetting Sculptures” (2008) and [...] "Mancapes" [...] (2010) at Gerhard-Marcks-Haus in Bremen and at Kunsthalle Tübingen.

It was a sort of <b>self-help</b> <b>project,</b> to which I still subscribe, shamefacedly. I have no general education, whereas Edward’s piece seemed to be incredibly knowledgeable in just that way.

40|$|M. A. It is {{estimated}} that the large percentage of rural South African households are living in poverty. The majority of rural households rely mainly on state social grants for income In order to wage a war on poverty and unemployment, the Department of Social Development developed policies and programmes targeted at poverty prevention, alleviation and reduction {{and the development of}} people’s capacity to take charge of their own circumstances in a meaningful way. Thusano <b>self-help</b> <b>project</b> was initiated to fight poverty, unemployment and malnutrition. An exploratory study was conducted; the main objective was to assess the impact that the project had on its members. The researcher used a one-group post-test only design. Non- Probability, Convenience Sampling was used to assemble respondents of the study. Face to face interviews or personal interviews were conducted with 19 respondents i. e. 10 participants in the project and 9 drop outs. Interviews were chosen {{due to the fact that}} majority of respondents were illiterate. Data collected revealed that the majority of respondents were women and single parents. The project exposed project members to various training programmes, but the level of literacy had a negative impact to some project members. Those who are illiterate could not be trained on some skills like bookkeeping as it requires the ability to read and write. More than half of the respondents indicated that the project enabled them to meet most basic needs like food, school requirements and family health status improved. For those who were still participating in the project, they indicated that even though income in monetary terms was minimal, they remained due to the fact that they solely depend on the project to provide for their families with a variety of fresh and dried crops and vegetables. But they indicated that if they can get more remunerative employment they might leave. Drop-outs indicated that they left due to different reasons i. e. their children found employment, poor health, and receiving old age pension. From the data collected it was concluded that the project had assisted all participants to meet most basic needs, but there I was a need to improve their rewards (income) so that they can meet other needs like housing, clothing and other basic costs.

40|$|Cue: One {{major impact}} of AIDS and HIV on farming {{communities}} {{has been a}} devastating loss of manpower, both from those who fall sick, and from those adults and children who have to care for them. However, as well as this loss of manpower, AIDS is also killing off knowledge and skills. Children who lose one or both parents to AIDS are often forced to leave school {{in order to work}} or beg for money, and as well as losing their chance of formal education, may also get no informal training in agriculture or other life skills. There is now a real worry that {{a very large number of}} the next generation of Africa?s farmers will not have the knowledge to grow the crops that African countries depend on. Clearly something has do be done to address this situation, whether by governments or local groups. Help to Self-Help, based in Arusha, Tanzania, is one such local organisation that is doing just that. Working with under-privileged children and orphans, the staff of Help to Self-Help teach skills that will enable the children to earn money and grow food. Lazarus Laiser recently visited a school set up by the organisation, and spoke to Method Lyaruu, one of the education project advisors. IN:		?We decided to start a school ?? OUT:		??from these two villages. ? DUR?N	 4 ? 40 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Method Lyaruu ending that report from Arusha, Tanzania. Transcript Lyaruu	We decided to start a school which will take girls, under-privileged girls so that they can learn some skills in order to run their lives. As you have heard that our name is ?Help to <b>Self-Help</b> <b>Project?</b> means that we help them a bit so that they can help themselves. We used to take those who have got no fathers, no father, no mother, maybe they have died from HIV, maybe thrown away in the street and then they have grown up, they don?t have anywhere to get help and then we are dealing with them. But also we are dealing with the other people outside Arusha municipality. In some few villages we are giving them some assistance in agriculture in order to help themselves in their lives in the families. Laiser	In agricultural area how do you help these students or these youth? Lyaruu	Ok here, a part of these skills they are getting, we have got a garden here. We are teaching them how to take care of the garden especially to these vegetables so that maybe sometimes if they have got time from their skills then they can involve themselves to their area where they can get maybe vitamins and other things. But mostly we are doing this in order to have more than two things; they can do their skills and then in their part-time they can do gardening so that they can help their families. Laiser	Method, would you allow me to visit the garden? Lyaruu	Oh yes definitely it?s allowed, you can go and see it. Laiser	Method now I can see a very, very good garden here. Who is responsible in this garden? Lyaruu	We have got here Mama Makundi, she?s here. Makundi	I?m Mama Makundi, I?m teaching the girls how to plant a garden. So we have a garden here in our school. We have planted different kinds of vegetables and also herbs. We have planted herbs also which they can use in cooking, so here they learn about herbs and vegetables to help them in their own lives. They can employ themselves through gardening. Laiser	Do you do also in villages? Makundi	Yes they have to do the same in their home lives. So I try to make follow up if they are doing the same as we taught them or not. So some of them have already started their own garden. Laiser	Mr Method while we are standing on this garden I would like also to ask you about now what you are doing in the villages? Lyaruu	Ok we?ve got three villages at the start. In Likamba we have got these cover crops. We encourage them to put cover crops because there at Likamba they have got serious soil erosion. Then we have got Manyire in this Arumeru district also. We have got horticultural to nursery school kids. It is very interesting that we are teaching nursery school kids how to keep vegetables. And these kids are from 4 years to 6 years. We give to each a piece of garden and then we plant something there and we teach how to take care. Laiser	Can a 4 year old child learn how to take care of his own garden? Lyaruu	Yes, yes, yes according to what we have found in our research, she can or he can, watering the garden, he can make some weeding in the garden. Apart from this we have been helping them for more than 10 years for seeds, the whole village, these two villages. Laiser	You provide the seeds? Lyaruu	We provide the seeds to them. But this year we?ve decided to stop on giving them seeds always. What we have done, we have started a project which can help them to produce their own seeds. So we have given them foundation seeds so that they can grow and produce seeds themselves, so that they will stop coming and getting help always because our project is Help to Self-Help. You are to be helped, then you can help yourself. That is what we are doing. Now this year we have started this and we have seen a fruit because we are expecting to harvest more than 2000 kilograms of seeds from these two villages. End of track.

40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDStudies by feminists {{frequently}} investigate {{reasons why}} poverty reduction strategies involving income and work generation projects for poor women fail {{to deliver on}} set economic and social goals to provide jobs, income, education and skills training. Several reviews {{over a number of}} decades indicate a prevalence of welfare-oriented interventions that apparently contradict the intended transformative potential of economic empowerment, gender equality goals and anticipated outcomes included during the design of national policies and programmes. Different theoretical frameworks have, over time, been called upon to account for and have attempted to explain these shifts, changes and contradictions. Studies of women and work in developing countries in the 1970 s and 1980 s were mostly led by economists who commented on the perceived failure of policies and projects, and continued to investigate the cause of this anomaly. Given that the majority of these experiments combined both social and economic goals these policy findings were later viewed with skepticism leading to further probes about recurring failures, and the lack of progress to improve the status of poor women. After decades of scientific research on gender inequality and a slow pace of change with regard to poor women’s economic status in developing countries, feminists revealed a disturbing finding: the lack of sound, ethical evaluation criteria and frameworks. This influenced a dramatic shift to alternative normative (value-based) approaches in which ethical and moral debates on development policy implementation flourished. Pointing to a general lack of empirical studies addressing policy implementation, arguments by these standpoint feminists proposed that policy and project implementation in different contexts lag far behind achievements in research and policy evidence. This assumption about the lack of integration of policy evidence with appropriate feminist theory, underpins my main motivation in this thesis. My intention is to apply a new feminist lens in order to examine the gendered nature of the historical period in which transitional policies in South Africa were implemented in the aftermath of authoritarian apartheid policies. The current thesis argues for adoption of the political ethics of care (PEOC) as an appropriate normative feminist policy research approach providing excellent criteria for exploring the gendered dimensions of new social policies and programmes implemented during the first policy cycle of reform towards democratising South African society (also referred to as the transition 1994 - 2001). At the time of its conception, my investigation proceeded with the realisation that iv many projects and programmes were evolving; and that contextual impact assessment criteria in the field of gender and development policy remained an emerging new research terrain lacking appropriate and critical gendered social indicators for monitoring, evaluation and theory building. Most of the newly formulated policies included results of previous research recording the historical role and socio-economic effects of apartheid policies. However, an urgent need existed for new critical gender perspectives to address important post-apartheid issues of vulnerable groups – such as women, youth, physically challenged and children – and arguing for their full citizenship, including economic citizenship and integration into job creation. The evolving policy relational structures that were embarked on during this reform, such as democratic state-civil society partnerships, new democratic decision-making, dialogical processes and policy service programmes, were in dire need of exploration and re-examination using alternative and new feminist theoretical lenses. This study explored the field of social policy implementation {{in the context of this}} transition period. It investigated the phenomenon of income generation projects (IGPs), being a development that was new to the South African professional social work disciplinary field. Used as a key macroeconomic policy mechanism, IGPs were embedded in policy relational structures (in the form of partnerships or consortiums) during the transition period. They formed a key part of policy interventions in social development as prescribed by the White Paper on Social Welfare (Department of Welfare, 1997 b) having a dual purpose: to reduce poverty and unemployment, and to promote gender-sensitive strategies. The qualitative nature of the design used for this study is combined with a post-modernist and post-structuralist, gendered case study approach drawing on programme evaluation research techniques. Direct observation, documentary analysis, depth interviews and focus groups sessions formed part of a comprehensive data-gathering research strategy used in different micro-project and community settings in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. Three broad research questions were pursued throughout this enquiry, addressing the following: the extent to which income generation projects as proposed within the National Developmental Policy Framework were addressing poverty and gender inequality in a satisfactory way; what appropriate normative frameworks and concepts to study these existed; and whether the PEOC could serve as an alternative framework; and how a user perspective could be incorporated in public debates and policy-making. v A sample of four partnership project cases, targeting poor black women (and men) from three different community settings – being semi-rural, peri-urban and urban – as primary beneficiaries met the selection criteria for this longitudinal, in-depth study that drew on purposive and theoretical sampling approaches. All the projects or programmes included in the sample were engaged in job creation and social development work involving multiple stakeholders and partners. A significant part of the study focussed on the formation of partner relationships or consortiums between government, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), together with grassroots community-based <b>self-help</b> <b>project</b> participants (beneficiary) groups and individuals. Information and data collected were audio-taped, transcribed and analysed to assess the impact and social effects of newly implemented policy structures and processes on subjects. Alternative feminist theoretical and analytical approaches, being a care perspective that combined critical gender assessment methodologies and feminist ethics (political ethic of care) were applied to argue for more critical and appropriate, gendered research studies that could capture the important link between macroeconomic policies and evidence of unpaid care work embedded and performed within the development sector. By foregrounding the invisible unpaid care work performed by low intensity citizens in this sector, the state’s role and interaction as a development partner with NGOs and poor citizens in the implementation of social development policies that involved job creation and IGPs became apparent. This thesis concludes by reiterating feminist proposals for a more inclusive notion of citizenship and calling for on-going studies to monitor perspectives on gender equality and work creation. More importantly, it suggests that PEOC could serve as an important research and analytical framework to document and integrate the right and access, by both men and women, to care, a critically important gender equality principle so often neglected in existing studies and scholarship...|$|E

40|$|There is {{the general}} {{impression}} that traditional societies, {{especially those in the}} developing world, lack participatory mechanisms for their citizens to effectively participate in decisions affecting their lives. This study therefore is an attempt to examine the concept of participation in relation to decision-making and execution of community <b>self-help</b> <b>projects</b> in the Akan traditional society in Ghana. The objective is not to confirm or disagree with this general notion, but to reveal the processes and levels of involvement of the Akans in decisions affecting their lives. For better understanding of the decision-making processes in the Akan society, one needs to examine the various cultural events depicting the life-cycle of the Akans. The study therefore used the Rites of Passage of the Akan - Birth/Naming, Initiation, Marriage and Death/Funeral - as case studies. In addition to these cultural events, some <b>self-help</b> <b>projects</b> executed by the Akans in some communities were also examined. Since the Akan society is undergoing significant transformation especially due to modernization and western influence, some activities and participation processes of few external community development agencies working in the Akanland were also examined for comparison. The study reviewed some literature on Culture and Participation and focused on Hofstedes 2 ̆ 7 s (2002) four main dimensions of culture for the theoretical framework. The study concluded that the Akan society is collectivist, has large power distance, has high uncertainty avoidance and is masculine. The values of these dimensions significantly affect one 2 ̆ 7 s involvement in decision-making. Therefore there are various levels of participation in decision-making in the Akan Society mainly based on age, sex, group membership and position in the family or the community. Again the study reaffirmed that the Akan culture has rich indigenous knowledge based on their cultural values that development partners working in the Akanland could utilize for successful execution of programs...|$|R

40|$|Using a contextualist, interpretivist {{research}} method anchored in a South African rural women's organization, this paper {{contributes to the}} discourse on ICT-enabled rural microeconomic development. A conceptual framework, encapsulating rural socioeconomic development, ICTs (e-commerce through a government-sponsored telecentre), and marketing (as a particular business process) is probed using an in-situ participative action research project {{in cooperation with the}} organization's management team; and analyzed through Actor-Network Theory. The results reveal key barriers experienced by a rural development organization exploring ICT-enabled migration paths from development (<b>self-help</b> <b>projects)</b> to micro-enterprise. These barriers include the impact of traditional practices on a modern organization; the struggle to align marketing principles with cultural constraints; the conceptual confusion of relating development principles to business practices in a community isolated from regional and national levels of development; the consequences of leapfrogging the phases of institutionalization when implementing ICTs; and the consequences of the transitory mobilization of actors. 22 page(s...|$|R
