The MAS-36 carried a 17-inch spike bayonet, reversed in a tube below the barrel. To use the bayonet, a <b>spring</b> <b>plunger</b> was pressed to release the bayonet. It was then free to be pulled out, turned around, and fitted back into its receptacle. Like the Lebel model 1886 rifle, the MAS-36 featured a stacking hook offset {{to the right side}} of the barrel for standing a number of the rifles (usually a trio) upwards.|$|R

50|$|The {{music for}} the machine {{consists}} of stage adaptations from the original Rock opera Tommy, composed by Pete Townshend of The Who. There are 21 songs total programmed to play throughout gameplay and for various stages and modes. Songs include Captain Walker, It's a Boy, Christmas, See Me Feel Me,Smash the Mirror, Fiddle About, Cousin Kevin, Sensation, Acid Queen, Pinball Wizard, and Sally Simpson. To launch each ball, the player can use either an automatic launch by pressing a flipper button while a ball is in the alley, or manually via the <b>spring</b> <b>plunger</b> assembly. The machine includes an automated silver disc that rotates to cover the flipper portion of the machine to emulate playing pinball as the title character. This mode occurs during each multiball sequence, or for the entire duration of the game by player selection of the Tommy game mode. The owner/operator may program a feature that allows the player to exchange credits for extra ball(s) to continue the game where it left off.|$|R

40|$|To {{downsize}} {{the clamp}} area {{and increase the}} output power of the harvester, we developed a miniature piezoelectric vibration energy harvester with combining a Z-shaped folded spring and a mechanically-switching SSHI (synchronized switch harvesting on inductor). The overall harvester size is 4 i× 2 i× 3 cm 3. The FEM analysis revealed that the output power increases {{and the value of}} the 1 st and 2 nd resonance frequencies move closer as the angle of the Z-shaped spring decreases, therefore, the smaller angle would be more promising. The experimental results showed that the maximum output power of our harvester for the 1 st (20. 2 Hz) and 2 nd (53. 0 Hz) resonance frequencies at the applied acceleration of 4. 9 m/s 2 are 088 and 0. 98 mW, respectively. The reason for a marked enhancement of the output power for the 2 nd resonance frequency is attributed to the vertical movement of the 2 nd vibrational mode which applies larger mechanical stress to the piezo ceramic and achieves better electrical contact between the tip of the Z-shaped spring and the <b>spring</b> <b>plunger.</b> © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|R

The pressure is gradually increased until the central retinal vein begins to pulsate, which happens at the point when the applied external pressure nears the VOP and is approximately equal to ICP. The original method was described in 1925 by Baurmann [...] and belongs to the public domain, but several modifications have been recently patented that combine the classic ophthalmodynamometry with reflectance oximetry of the retina [...] or ultrasound measurement of blood flow in the central retinal artery, or automate the method by adding a camera and an image processing software capable of recognizing venous pulsations from a sequence of images of the eye fundus. Evaluation in patients confirmed a strong linear relationship and clinically negligible differences (2-3mmHg) between VOP and the invasively measured ICP. Ophthalmodynamometry requires dilated pupils, a skilled physician or medic and collaboration of the patient, which all hampers its applicability in the field. It cannot be applied in cases of ocular trauma or conditions that selectively affect the optic nerve, and gives erroneously high readings {{in the presence of}} a papilledema, which may persist long after ICP has returned to normal.|$|R

50|$|The mains {{connectors}} of {{the appliance}} plug are two rounded sockets that accept two rounded pins from the appliance. They are unpolarised. The third connection, earth, {{is a large}} metal contact {{on each side of}} the plug body which makes contact with the sides of the plug receptacle, grounding the appliance body. Some appliances using these connectors incorporate a <b>spring</b> and <b>plunger</b> mechanism with a temperature-sensitive release system; if the temperature rises significantly above a preset limit - for example, if a kettle boils dry - the spring is released and (if all goes well) the plunger pushes the plug and socket apart. It must then be allowed to cool and reset manually by forcing the connector back into the appliance.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a model that}} can simulate the behaviour of a pneumatic intensifier that is generally referred to as an 'air pump' (AP). The AP is used in many South African underground mines, and utilizes compressed air with pressures between 0. 3 - 0. 6 MPa to pump water up to pressures of 12 - 18 MPa. The high pressure water is used in numerous underground mines to pressurize props and roof bolts that act as safety and roof support devices. The simulation model reproduces the intensifiers operation under various conditions and therefore {{can be used to}} investigate the AP's sensitivity towards environmental conditions, design parameters (such as <b>spring</b> stiffness, <b>plunger</b> diameter, nozzle diameter etc.) and operating conditions. Model validation by comparison with laboratory experiments showed good correlation.

The actuated atomizer includes an outer shell formed by an inner ring; an outer ring; an actuator insert and a cap. A nozzle framework is positioned within the actuator insert. A {{base of the}} nozzle framework defines swirl inlets, a swirl chamber and a swirl chamber. A nozzle insert defines a center inlet and feed ports. A spool is positioned within the coil housing, and carries the coil windings having a number of turns calculated {{to result in a}} magnetic field of sufficient strength to overcome the bias of the <b>spring.</b> A <b>plunger</b> moves in response to the magnetic field of the windings. A stop prevents the pintle from being withdrawn excessively. A pintle, positioned by the plunger, moves between first and second positions. In the first position, the head of the pintle blocks the discharge passage of the nozzle framework, thereby preventing the atomizer from discharging fluid. In the second position, the pintle is withdrawn from the swirl chamber, allowing the atomizer to release atomized fluid. A spring biases the pintle to block the discharge passage. The strength of the spring is overcome, however, by the magnetic field created by the windings positioned on the spool, which withdraws the plunger into the spool and further compresses the spring...|$|R

40|$|The {{controlling}} behaviour of {{a vehicle}} {{is influenced by the}} performance of its steering system. The steering system consists of steering wheel, steering column, rack and pinion, steering gearbox, and a linkage system. The vehicle is controlled by the behaviour of the steering gear with the spring loaded rack and pinion. This spring loading arrangement consists of yoke nut, <b>spring,</b> and <b>plunger.</b> The plunger is always in contact with the rack, by the spring and yoke nut. The spring loading arrangement helps to eliminate the backlash between the rack and pinion, but increases the preload on the gear. This increases the torque required to rotate the steering wheel by the driver. In order to reduce this torque requirement, the spring loading can be reduced which in turn will increase the noise when the vehicle running on a bumpy road, and also may turn undesirably due to road disturbances. Hence, contradictory requirements to be fulfilled in the steering gear. This is done by providing an allowable preload on the spring. In practice, however, it will be desirable that the steering system is stiff while going on a straight road, and less stiff while turning at low speeds. This is accomplished by a Sensor-Actuator Based Smart Yoke for the rack and pinion steering system. In this arrangement, the sensor will sense the rack position. This sensor used here is a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT). The sensor signal is captured by LabView software, and according to the sensor data, the software calculates a signal for the DC servo motor, that rotates the plunger causing the change in spring loading. The LabView signal is calculated based on an empirical formula obtained from a real torque data required in the rack and pinion steering system...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, novel dry-contact sensors for {{measuring}} electro-encephalography (EEG) signals without any skin preparation are designed, fabricated by an injection molding manufacturing process and experimentally validated. Conventional wet electrodes {{are commonly used}} to measure EEG signals; they provide excellent EEG signals subject to proper skin preparation and conductive gel application. However, a series of skin preparation procedures for applying the wet electrodes is always required and usually creates trouble for users. To overcome these drawbacks, novel dry-contact EEG sensors were proposed for potential operation in {{the presence or absence}} of hair and without any skin preparation or conductive gel usage. The dry EEG sensors were designed to contact the scalp surface with 17 spring contact probes. Each probe was designed to include a probe head, <b>plunger,</b> <b>spring,</b> and barrel. The 17 probes were inserted into a flexible substrate using a one-time forming process via an established injection molding procedure. With these 17 spring contact probes, the flexible substrate allows for high geometric conformity between the sensor and the irregular scalp surface to maintain low skin-sensor interface impedance. Additionally, the flexible substrate also initiates a sensor buffer effect, eliminating pain when force is applied. The proposed dry EEG sensor was reliable in measuring EEG signals without any skin preparation or conductive gel usage, as compared with the conventional wet electrodes...|$|R
40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} a preload release mechanism comprising a preload spring assembly adapted {{to apply a}} preload to a first connector member which is mounted on a support structure and adapted for connection with a second connector member on an object. The assembly comprises telescoped bushings and a preload spring. A tubular shaft extends through the spring assembly and openings in the first connector member and support structure, on which it is clamped. A plunger rod in the shaft is provided with a tip end and a recess in the rod near the other end thereof. A retainer precludes passage of the rod through the shaft {{in one direction and}} an end cap closes the bore of the shaft at the other end and provides a shoulder which extends radially of the shaft. A <b>plunger</b> return <b>spring</b> biases the <b>plunger</b> rod against the plunger retainer with the plunger tip protruding from the shaft and a spring assembly return spring engages at its ends the shoulder of the end cap and one end of the spring assembly. Detents received in lateral openings in the tubular shaft are held captive by the plunger rod and one end of the spring assembly to lock the spring assembly on the tubular shaft and apply a preload to the first connector member. Upon completion of the connection, detents and spring assembly are released by plunger contact with the object to be connected, thereby releasing the preload while the connection is maintained...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to develop a specific modelling approach capable of reducing the size of the fuel injector solenoid device while improving its response time and attraction force. Several developed modelling and simulation procedures have focused on various aspects of solenoid component modifications in order to develop an evolution process of miniaturising a fuel injector solenoid, using the latest finite element method (FEM) tool software. The specific factors that influenced the optimum operation of the fuel injector solenoid were the geometrical shape of individual solenoid components, material properties, air-gap constraints, boundary conditions, current source conditions, mass constants, and damping coefficients of the plunger. The attraction force distribution in the main air-gap was directly influenced by the taper angle of the 2 D and 3 D plunger pole faces, plunger length and the permanent magnetism. The precise definition of the electro-mechanical motion of plunger was of enormous importance in reducing the fuel injector solenoid response time, closely related to stroke and mass of the <b>plunger,</b> <b>spring</b> characteristics, motion and rebound of the plunger. Using the developed approach, the initial size of the fuel injector has been reduced by 35 %, the attraction force increased by 26 % and the response time reduced by 76 %. However, by frequently repeating the design trials and conducting a thorough experimental investigation, the final minimum response time was achieved by the virtual rebound delay model. The reduction in response time from the &# 039;optimal&# 039; experimental to virtual model was by 35 %.

40|$|This {{research}} {{presents a}} theoretical and {{experimental study of}} the dynamic response of a 2602 Texas Remcor solenoid valve. The dynamic response {{is characterized by a}} physical model. The model identifies the effective parameters on the valve performance. It has been found that current, pressure, flow rate, <b>spring</b> force, and <b>plunger</b> mass have some effect on the valve performance. Based on the dynamic model analysis, some operational conditions, like pressure and voltage, have been varied. Also some modifications have been applied to the original valve. The valve has been operated at 30, 40, and 50 psi and at 12, 24, and 36 volt. The valve modifications include the weight and the shape of the plunger and the volume of the cavity after the outlet orifice. In order to track any sign of improvement, the valve response has been divided into four phases: i. 	Plunger- opening time. ii. 	Flow- opening time. iii. 	Plunger- closing time. iv. 	Flow - shutting off time. For each phase, the performance of original and modified valve has been tested. For the first phase, a significant improvement has been achieved in which the time delay has been reduced from the average of 17. 8 and 25. 1 ms to 4. 6 and 4. 8 ms for original and modified valve respectively. Furthermore, it was observed that the valve required more voltage as the fluid pressure increased. Reducing the volume of the valve had helped in reducing the time for the flow to reach its maximum value into half (from 3. 95 to 2. 15 ms). The plunger - closing time was found to independent to the flow rate, pressure, and voltage. It depended only on the spring force; thus, by reducing plunger’s weight significantly reduced the closing time. The average closing time for the original plunger is 13. 5 ms where it is equal to 2. 9 ms for the modified valve. The time delay in the final phase depends on the ability of the nozzle to drain the remaining fluid in the valve after closing the plunger. The time is varied from 62 ms at the lowest flow rate to 1. 6 ms highest flow rate. Reducing the volume of the valve cavity significantly decreased this time delay. The valve performance in general has been measured for the original and the modified valve in terms of area under the response curve. The modifications reduced the application error and brought the performance closer to the ideal situation. Several springs were tested for performance, the time delay of opening and closing the plunger was improved by 34 % when using the NN – 47 spring. However, the optimum spring constant K in which the opening and closing time of the plunger were the shortest was found experimentally to be 200 N/m...|$|R
