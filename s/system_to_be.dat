5|$|The poor {{conditions}} at the penitentiary were partially because the state leased management of the facility to private contractors, who frequently neglected prisoners' needs to cut costs.

5|$|This metric {{contains}} a scale factor, which {{describes how the}} size of the universe changes with time. This enables a convenient choice of a coordinate <b>system</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> made, called comoving coordinates. In this coordinate system, the grid expands along with the universe, and objects that are moving only because of the expansion of the universe, remain at fixed points on the grid. While their coordinate distance (comoving distance) remains constant, the physical distance between two such co-moving points expands proportionally with the scale factor of the universe.|$|E
5|$|A {{decreased}} budget led to Nokomis {{losing its}} Saturday operating hours in 2004. The Nokomis East Neighborhood Association, Thrivent Financial for Lutherans, {{and members of}} the community subsequently put funds towards keeping the library open on Saturdays until in mid-2005 when money was reallocated in the budget for continued Saturday operation. Further budget woes continued to plague the Minneapolis Public Libraries as of early 2007, by which point the system had had to temporarily close three different branches in part due to a loss of local government aid. A merger with the Hennepin County Libraries was approved by both systems' boards along with the Minneapolis City Council and Nokomis reopened at 10 am on January 2, 2008, as a Hennepin County Library. It remained the only building in the newly expanded 41-library <b>system</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> named for a fictional character.|$|E

5|$|A large {{tropical}} wave, {{which eventually}} became Erika, moved {{off the coast}} of Africa on August 31. Shortly after leaving the coast, it displayed a large low-level circulation, though as it tracked westward, the circulation failed to contract significantly. It slowly organized, and by September 3 the convection within the circulation had sufficiently organized for the <b>system</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> classified as Tropical Depression Six, while located about 1150miles (1850km) east of the southernmost Lesser Antilles. The depression moved west-northwestward at approximately 20mph (32km/h) under the influence of a well-established subtropical ridge, and late on September 3 the system intensified into a tropical storm. At that time, the National Hurricane Center in Miami gave the storm the name of Erika.|$|E
5|$|A second variant on the Tetrarch {{design was}} the Tetrarch Duplex Drive ("Tetrarch DD"). The Duplex Drive system {{was invented by}} Nicholas Straussler, and was {{designed}} to allow a tank to 'swim' through water and participate in amphibious operations. The system functioned by erecting a large waterproof canvas screen around the tank above its tracks, which was supported by thirty-six inflatable tubes and steel struts; this gave the tank sufficient buoyancy to float, and was then propelled along by a small propeller powered by the tank's engine. The screen could be collapsed by using a small explosive charge once the tank reached land. The system was fitted during June 1941, as the Tetrarch was the lightest light tank available at the time; the converted tank was successfully tested {{on a number of}} lakes and reservoirs, allowing the Duplex Drive <b>system</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> tested on heavier tanks, such as the Valentine. The system would be used during Operation Overlord, when M4 Sherman medium tanks would land on the invasion beaches.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August11. Associated deep convection quickly decreased after tracking westward through the tropical Atlantic Ocean, although by August13 a broad low pressure area and closed circulation developed along the wave. Environmental conditions favored tropical development, and the system gradually became better organized, although convection was initially limited near the center. On August 14, convection increased northwest of the center and became sufficiently well-organized for the <b>system</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> considered a tropical depression; at the time, it was located about 1500miles (2400km) east of the southern Windward Islands.|$|E
