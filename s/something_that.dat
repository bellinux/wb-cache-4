It is unclear if this is <b>something</b> <b>that</b> only a very few of the most massive LBVs undergo, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> is caused by a close companion star, or a very brief but common phase for massive stars. Some similar events in external galaxies have been mistaken for supernovae and have been called supernova impostors, although this grouping may also include other types of non-terminal transients that approach the brightness of a supernova.|$|E
