5|$|Ebert {{lived with}} {{cancer of the}} thyroid and salivary glands from 2002. This {{required}} treatments necessitating the removal of his lower jaw, which cost him the ability to <b>speak</b> <b>or</b> eat normally. His ability to write remained unimpaired, and he continued to publish frequently both online and in print until his death on April 4, 2013.|$|E
5|$|Several {{other matters}} were also raised, {{relating}} to particular {{parts of the}} evidence (specifically, relating to the witness testimony of Yahya Goba, one of the Buffalo Six), but these matters had little bearing on the final outcome of the case, and were dealt with only briefly by the court. The central argument raised was that, with regard to all the circumstances, Thomas did not actually have a practical choice whether to <b>speak</b> <b>or</b> not.|$|E

God be thanked, the throne of our King is too firmly settled to be shaken by the folly and rashness of every sottish companion.|$|E
5|$|The {{left and}} right sides of the brain appear symmetrical, but they {{function}} asymmetrically. For example, the counterpart of the left-hemisphere motor area controlling the right hand is the right-hemisphere area controlling the left hand. There are, however, several important exceptions, involving language and spatial cognition. The left frontal lobe is dominant for language. If a key language area in the left hemisphere is damaged, it can leave the victim unable to <b>speak</b> <b>or</b> understand, whereas equivalent damage to the right hemisphere would cause only minor impairment to language skills.|$|E
5|$|Tuberculosis {{is spread}} through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough, spit, <b>speak,</b> <b>or</b> sneeze. People with latent TB do not spread the disease. Active {{infection}} occurs more often in people with HIV/AIDS and in those who smoke. Diagnosis of active TB is based on chest X-rays, as well as microscopic examination and culture of body fluids. Diagnosis of latent TB relies on the tuberculin skin test (TST) or blood tests.|$|E

5|$|In 1840, at {{the urging}} of Garrison and Wendell Phillips, Lucretia Coffin Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton {{traveled}} with their husbands and a dozen other American male and female abolitionists to London for the first World's Anti-Slavery Convention, with the expectation that a motion put forward by Phillips to include women's participation in the convention would be controversial. In London, the proposal was rebuffed after a full day of debate; the women were allowed to listen from the gallery but not allowed to <b>speak</b> <b>or</b> vote. Mott and Stanton became friends in London and on the return voyage, and together planned to organize their own convention to further the cause of women's rights, separate from abolition concerns.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{suffered}} a severe stroke on April 18, 1994, while preparing to eat dinner in his Park Ridge, New Jersey home. A blood clot {{resulting from the}} atrial fibrillation he had suffered for many years had formed in his upper heart, broken off, and traveled to his brain. He was taken to New York Hospitalâ€“Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan, initially alert but unable to <b>speak</b> <b>or</b> to move his right arm or leg. Damage to the brain caused swelling (cerebral edema), and Nixon slipped into a deep coma. He died at 9:08p.m. on April 22, 1994, with his daughters at his bedside. He was 81 years old.|$|E

5|$|On 26 December 211, at a {{reconciliation}} meeting arranged by their mother, Caracalla had Geta assassinated {{by members of}} the Praetorian Guard loyal to himself, Geta dying in his mother's arms. Caracalla then persecuted and executed most of Geta's supporters and ordered a damnatio memoriae pronounced by the Senate against his brother's memory. Geta's image was removed from all paintings, coins were melted down, statues were destroyed, his name was struck from papyrus records, and it became a capital offence to <b>speak</b> <b>or</b> write Geta's name. In the aftermath of the damnatio memoriae, an estimated 20,000 people were massacred. Those killed were Geta's inner circle of guards and advisers, friends, and other military staff under his employ.|$|E
5|$|On Thursday, December 12, 1799, Washington {{spent several}} hours {{inspecting}} his plantation on horseback, in snow, hail, and freezing rain; that evening, he ate his supper without changing from his wet clothes. He awoke {{the next morning}} with a severe sore throat and became increasingly hoarse as the day progressed, yet still rode out in the heavy snow, marking trees for cutting on the plantation. Some time around 3a.m. that Saturday, he suddenly awoke with severe difficulty breathing and almost completely unable to <b>speak</b> <b>or</b> swallow. He was {{a firm believer in}} bloodletting, which was a standard medical practice of that era, and he had used it to treat various ailments of slaves on his plantation. He ordered estate overseer Albin Rawlins to remove nearly a pint of his blood.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} began formation {{as part of}} the Transcaucasian Front on 19 August 1941, {{under the}} command of Colonel Ivan Vinogradov at Makharadze. Out of 10,252 soldiers in the division at its inception, 8,979 had never handled weapons. Most of its troops could not <b>speak</b> <b>or</b> understand Russian. The enlisted personnel of the 390th were mostly Armenian and Azerbaijani peasants, while junior and political officers were Russian and Georgian. On 23 November, it joined the 51st Army, and by early December the division command post was located at Taman on the coast of the Kerch Strait.|$|E

5|$|As decolonisation {{proceeded}} {{throughout the}} British Empire in the 1950s and 1960s, former colonies often did not reject English but rather {{continued to use}} it as independent countries setting their own language policies. For example, the view of the English language among many Indians has gone from associating it with colonialism to associating it with economic progress, and English continues to be an official language of India. English is also widely used in media and literature, and the number of English language books published annually in India is the third largest in the world after the US and UK. However English is rarely spoken as a first language, numbering only around a couple hundred-thousand people, and less than 5% of the population speak fluent English in India. David Crystal claimed in 2004 that, combining native and non-native speakers, India now has more people who <b>speak</b> <b>or</b> understand English than {{any other country in the}} world, but the number of English speakers in India is very uncertain, with most scholars concluding that the United States still has more speakers of English than India.|$|E
5|$|With {{effect from}} 1 September 2008, under the Public Entertainments and Meetings (Speakers' Corner) (Exemption) Order 2008 ("2008 PEMA Order"), {{responsibility}} for registering people wishing to <b>speak</b> <b>or</b> stage an exhibition or performance at Speakers' Corner {{was taken over}} from the police by the Commissioner of Parks and Recreation by way of {{an amendment to the}} Parks and Trees Regulations. To provide greater convenience, the National Parks Board made it possible for people to register online at its website. In addition, it became possible to hold demonstrations provided that they are organized by Singapore citizens and the participants are only citizens and permanent residents. As the time period restriction was lifted, events can now be held around the clock. In addition, rules on voice amplification were revised to allow the use of self-powered amplification devices like loudhailers from 9:00a.m. to 10:30p.m. This relaxation of the rules potentially allows for speakers' messages to be heard by larger audiences. A minor change was also introduced to the conditions for the use of Speakers' Corner â€“ no banner, film, photograph, placard or poster containing any violent, lewd or obscene material may be displayed or exhibited whether before, during or after the event.|$|E

25|$|There {{are around}} 75 to 80 known Pakistani {{languages}} although, in practice, there are primarily six major languages in Pakistan spoken by 95% of the population: Punjabi, Pashto, Sindhi, Saraiki, Urdu, and Balochi. The official language is English {{and the national}} language is Urdu, the census indicates that around 8% of the population speak Urdu as their first language. However, due to rapid urbanization and modernization, the use of Urdu as a primary language is increasing, especially amongst the growing urbanized middle class of Pakistan. Most Pakistanis <b>speak</b> <b>or</b> understand at least two to three languages and almost all Pakistanis <b>speak</b> <b>or</b> understand the national language, Urdu.|$|E
