40|$|Violence is so {{widespread}} on modern screens {{that it becomes}} to be especially important in the discourse of the humanitarian knowledge. Significantly actual {{is the problem of}} the impact of media content on the audience and ways of its effective regulation. In this connection, the need to create a system of control over the information space comes to the fore. In Ukraine there is no adequate model of the estimation of media content. As to our opinion, the existing rating system focuses the attention on age limitations and {{does not take into account}} the semantic characteristics that are used effectively in systems of Western countries. The problem of individuals’ protection from interaction with the content, which contains violence, can not be solved by the restriction of the access to information, but instead the situation of temptation to get what is tabooed is created. Despite the obvious usefulness of classification systems, the question of their modern low effectiveness arises, when it comes to the individuals’ protection from the undesirable audiovisual information. Attempts to revise the criteria for an objective analysis of media content were, in particular, the motivation for the creation of an alternative classification system, based on the principle of informing with the help of pictograms. A serious work on the study of various theoretical approaches to the research of the screen cruelty has been made by the author (the experiment by A. Bandura, the study by T. Payne’s fund of theoretical and experimental science on the impact of the violence on adolescent behavior, Gerbner’s cultivation theory, the hypothesis of catharsis by D. Zallman and R Gibson). It has been established that an individual who has not received the sufficient social experience and education level is at risk. There comes a threat of influence of factors capable, which can deform ideas about the world around us. Main definitions have been made in the article and the distinctive features of the rating system against the system of pictograms have been described. The main models of classifications have been considered, and the Ukrainian approach to the control over information space has been described. System of visual labeling of violence in media content has been developed on the basis of made high-quality content analysis of audiovisual documents. It includes three main types of screen violence (physical, sexual, symbolic), each of which has a <b>special</b> <b>pictogram</b> and is divided into four levels (without violence, low, medium and high level of violence). Each level there corresponds to a certain color pictogram. This article describes in detail each of the types and levels of violence. Examples from the cinematography have been described in details in the article. In addition, the factors under which this system can function successfully (parents, children, broadcasters) have been analyzed...|$|E
