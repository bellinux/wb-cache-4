6000|$|... "There {{was only}} one {{explanation}} possible: The Water-devil was walking along the bottom, and towing us after him! Why he should pull us along in this way I could not imagine, unless he was making for his home in some dreadful cave at the bottom, into which he would <b>sink,</b> <b>dragging</b> us down after him.|$|R
5000|$|At 1543 U-21 fired {{a single}} 50 cm Type G torpedo {{at a range}} of 2,000 yards. At 1545 lookouts spotted a torpedo wake heading towards the {{starboard}} bow and the officer of the watch, Lieutenant-Commander Favell, attempted to take evasive action by ordering the starboard engine be put astern and the port engine at full ahead while the wheel was turned hard a port. Since the vessel was traveling at a mere five knots, however (due to a shortage of coal throughout the Royal Navy at the time), the manoeuvre was not in time and the torpedo struck the ship beneath the bridge. The detonation apparently set off cordite bags in the forward magazine which caused a second, more massive explosion within the fore section of the ship, essentially destroying everything forward of the bridge. Broken in two, the [...] "Pathfinder" [...] instantly began <b>sinking,</b> <b>dragging</b> most of her crew down with her and leaving a massive pall of smoke to mark her grave. The vessel sank so quickly, in fact, that there was insufficient time to launch lifeboats. (Indeed, {{the remains of a}} lifeboat davit and rope can still be seen on the wreck, demonstrating the speed with which the vessel sank.) ...|$|R
2500|$|Clallam {{never got}} to the shore. [...] Captain Roberts {{realized}} {{she was about to}} founder and signaled the Holyoke to cast off the towline. [...] Holyoke misunderstood Captain Roberts’ signal to cast off the tow line, so it had to be cut lest the <b>sinking</b> Clallam <b>drag</b> Holyoke down with her. Clallam rolled over and sank quickly at about 1:15 a.m. The tugs then went to rescue the people in the water, saving most or all of the 36 who had remained aboard. [...] Capt. Edward D. Hickman (1876–1928), then serving as mate on Richard Holyoke, dove into the icy water to rescue 15 people. [...] He suffered from poor health as a result for a long time afterwards.|$|R
40|$|The Wall-Pressure Signature Method for {{correcting}} low-speed {{wind tunnel}} data to free-air conditions has been revised and improved for two-dimensional tests of bluff bodies. The method uses experimentally measured tunnel wall pressures to approximately reconstruct the flow field about {{the body with}} potential sources and sinks. With {{the use of these}} sources and <b>sinks,</b> the measured <b>drag</b> and tunnel dynamic pressure are corrected for blockage effects. Good agreement is obtained with simpler methods for cases in which the blockage corrections were about 10 % of the nominal drag values...|$|R
60|$|The whole bow of {{the boat}} must have been crushed in, for {{in a few seconds}} the boat was half full. Then a couple of seas filled it, and it <b>sank</b> {{straight}} down, <b>dragged</b> to bottom by the heavy ballast. So quickly did it all happen that I was entangled in the sail and drawn under. When I fought my way to the surface, suffocating, my lungs almost bursting, I could see nothing of the oars. They must have been swept away by the chaotic currents. I saw Demetrios Contos looking back from his boat, and heard the vindictive and mocking tones of his voice as he shouted exultantly. He held steadily on his course, leaving me to perish.|$|R
40|$|Sa majeste " la reine, {{represented}} par le ministre de la Defense nationale, 2004 A modified k-e {{model is}} {{proposed for the}} simulation of the mean wind speed and turbulence for a neutrally-stratified flow through and over a building array, where groups of buildings in the array are aggregated and treated as a porous barrier. This model is based on time averaging the spatially-averaged Navier-Stokes equation, in which {{the effects of the}} obstacle-atmosphere interaction are included through the introduction of a volumetric momentum <b>sink</b> (representing <b>drag</b> on the unresolved buildings in the array). In addition, closure of the time-averaged, spatially-averaged Navier-Stokes equations requires two additional prog-nostic equations, namely one for the time-averaged sub-filter kinetic energy, 7 c, and another for the dissipation rate, e, of 7 c. The transport equation for 7 c can be derived from first principles and explicitly includes additional sources and sinks that arise from time aver-aging the product of the spatially-averaged velocity fluctuations and the distributed drag force fluctuations. The latter time-averaged product can be approximated systematically to any degree of accuracy using a Taylor series expansion and, to this end, a high-orde...|$|R
5000|$|In 1947, {{she and the}} tugboat Monarch {{were given}} the task of towing the hulk of the {{battleship}} [...] to San Francisco Bay to be scrapped. However, 500 miles from Hawaii, they were struck by a powerful storm and the Oklahoma began taking on water and <b>sinking,</b> threatening to <b>drag</b> the two tugs along with her. While the Monarch managed to release her lines, Hercules could not get free until the last moment, narrowly avoiding being dragged into the deep by the Oklahoma. Afterwards, she returned to shuttling car floats and worked in this role until 1957, when she {{was replaced by the}} diesel-powered train ferry [...] Hercules was kept in a stand-by role to the new ferry until 1961.|$|R
50|$|One {{theory for}} the {{formation}} of the basin is that it is dynamic topography due to a sinking slab of oceanic crust. This slab was subducted during latest Cretaceous and Early Cenozoic periods {{to the north of the}} Australian continent underneath New Guinea. The slab broke off and was gradually overridden by the Australian plate moving north. The sinking slab has a trace in the P-wave velocity in the mantle which is higher from 800 to 1200 km deep below the Murray basin, and also the Lake Eyre Basin. The velocity anomaly is oriented northwest-southeast and extends from 135°E 26°S to 144°E35°S. The <b>sinking</b> has <b>dragged</b> down the rock above it to make a hollow which is the basin. This hollow has moved south over the last 50 million years. If this theory is correct, then the Murray basin will move south over the next tens of millions of years and disappear under the Southern Ocean. Modelling using the Underworld program by Moresi indicates that the slab would be sinking at 8.5 mm per year and cause a depression on the surface 200 m deep around 2500 km wide. In the past the basin depression was narrower but deeper in this model.|$|R
60|$|She {{smiled at}} him rather dubiously and at the next step he <b>sank</b> deeper and <b>dragged</b> the horse round as he clung to the bridle. The roan plunged savagely and the water rippled about Kermode's waist as he {{struggled}} for a foothold on the slippery stones. With a desperate effort he managed to find firmer bottom and soon came out on a strip of shingle. Stopping {{there for a few}} moments, he gathered breath while the girl looked about. They were {{in the bottom of a}} deep gorge filled with the sound of running water and sweet resinous scents. Here the torrent flashed in bright sunshine; there it flowed, streaked with foam, through dim shadow, while somber pines towered above it. There was no sound or sign of human life; they had entered the gates of the wilderness.|$|R
25|$|Further explosions by {{two more}} torpedoes that hit under the second stack, port side (near frame 82 and about frame 85) {{less than two}} minutes later at about 0205 caused catastrophic and {{terminal}} damage. Men were thrown about twice with each following explosion and the force was greater the higher up in the ship's structure. This is the time that Carpenter was injured. The forward movement of the ship along with the massive structural frame damage caused the ship to twist and jackknife around the damaged area. The ship's momentum quickly fell off and began to flood. The center part twisted to 45 degrees port <b>sinking</b> first. It <b>dragged</b> the rear of the ship down until the stern was vertical. Men quickly realized that the damage was fatal and began to abandon ship. About 22 minutes after the ship was first hit the ship sunk, at about 0225. In the meantime, Carpenter - who had been wounded in the legs - and others of the crew abandoned ship by going over the side after cutting free all the surviving lift rafts into the ocean. Even though the forward momentum of the ship dropped off rapidly the survivors were scattered over several hundred yards, at night, amidst a raging naval battle. Later currents would separate them even more.|$|R
2500|$|Helena {{opened fire}} to port at 0157 hours. About seven minutes after she opened fire at about 0203 hours, Helena {{was hit by}} a torpedo. The first Japanese Type 93 torpedo, also called a [...] "Long Lance", could travel at 48–50 knots (56 to 57 Mph) and {{impacted}} Helena on the port side just below number one turret (near frame 32), tearing off the bow of the ship. The following explosions by two more torpedoes that hit under the second stack, port side, (near frame 82 and about frame 85) less than two minutes later at about 0205, caused catastrophic and terminal damage. The forward movement of the ship along with the massive structural frame damage caused the ship to twist and jackknife around the damaged area. The ship, still under momentum, went past her own bow and began to flood. The center part twisted to 45 degrees port <b>sinking</b> first. It <b>dragged</b> the rear of the ship down until the stern was vertical. About 22 minutes after the ship was first hit the ship sank at about 0225. In the mean time, the crew abandoned ship by going over the side after cutting free all the surviving life rafts into the ocean. Between the forward momentum of the ship the survivors were scattered over several hundred yards, at night, amidst a raging naval battle. Later currents would separate them even more. The bow would finally sink later the next day.|$|R
40|$|The {{vertical}} migration and accumulation of Microcystis {{is an important}} process in water blooms, and colony migration is influenced by colony size and wind-wave disturbance. The {{vertical migration}} of Microcystis colonies in turbulence can be simulated in a numerical model. In this study, we model such migration by coupling the colony size and hydrodynamics, including the gravity, colony buoyancy, and the viscous drag force of turbulence. The turbulence intensity was represented by the turbulent kinetic energy (K Z); the larger the K Z, the stronger the wind-wave disturbance. The simulated vertical distribution of Microcystis well agreed with the measured values in a laboratory experiment indicating that our model can simulate the vertical distribution of Microcystis under different hydrodynamic conditions. We also found a size-dependent critical turbulent kinetic energy (T K Z), such that if the turbulent kinetic energy of water exceeds the critical value (i. e., K Z > T K Z), the colonies <b>sink</b> under the <b>drag</b> forces of turbulence; conversely, if K Z < T K Z, the colonies can overcome the turbulent mixing and float. The T K Z of each colony was linearly related to colony diameter. The model is crucial for prediction and prevention of water blooms. The simulated threshold turbulent kinetic energy, at which water blooms disappear in Lake Taihu (a large freshwater lake in the Yangtze Delta, Jiangsu Province, China), was 55. 5 cm 2 s − 2.  </p...|$|R

6000|$|Arthur Berkeley {{laid the}} letter {{down with a}} quiet sigh, and folded his hands despondently before him. He hadn't seen very much of Edie, yet the {{disappointment}} was to him a very bitter one. It had been a pleasant day-dream, truly, and he was both to part with it so unexpectedly. 'Poor little Miss Butterfly,' he said to himself, tenderly and compassionately; 'poor, airy, flitting, bright-eyed little Miss Butterfly. I must give you up, must I, and Ernest Le Breton must take you for better, for worse, must he? La reyne le veult, it seems, and her word is law. I'm afraid he's hardly the man to make you happy, little lady; kind-hearted, well-meaning, but too much in earnest, too much absorbed in his ideas of right for a world where right's impossible, and {{every man for himself}} is the wretched sordid rule of existence. He will overshadow and darken your bright little life, I fear me; not intentionally--he couldn't do that--but by his Quixotic fads and fancies; good fads, honest fads, but fads wholly impracticable in this jarring universe of clashing interests, where he who would swim must keep his own head steadily above water, and he who minds his neighbour must sink like lead to the unfathomable bottom. He will sink, I doubt not, poor little Miss Butterfly; he will <b>sink</b> inevitably, and <b>drag</b> you down with him, down, down, down to immeasurable depths of poverty and despair. Oh, my poor little butterfly, I'm sorry for you, and sorry for myself. It was a pretty dream, and I loved it dearly. I had made you a queen in my fancy, and throned you in my heart, and now I have to dethrone you again, me miserable, and have my poor lonely heart bare and queenless!' ...|$|R
