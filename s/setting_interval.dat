40|$|The <b>interval</b> <b>set</b> is {{a special}} set, which {{describes}} uncertainty of an uncertain concept or set Z with its two crisp boundaries named upper-bound set and lower-bound set. In this paper, the concept of similarity degree between two <b>interval</b> <b>sets</b> is defined at first, and then the similarity degrees between an <b>interval</b> <b>set</b> and its two approximations (i. e., upper approximation set R¯(Z) and lower approximation set R_(Z)) are presented, respectively. The disadvantages of using upper-approximation set R¯(Z) or lower-approximation set R_(Z) as approximation sets of the uncertain set (uncertain concept) Z are analyzed, and a new method for looking for a better approximation <b>set</b> of the <b>interval</b> <b>set</b> Z is proposed. The conclusion that the approximation set R 0. 5 (Z) is an optimal approximation <b>set</b> of <b>interval</b> <b>set</b> Z is drawn and proved successfully. The change rules of R 0. 5 (Z) with different binary relations are analyzed in detail. Finally, a kind of crisp approximation <b>set</b> of the <b>interval</b> <b>set</b> Z is constructed.

The essential of the test is, that the communication caused precedence constraints are mapped to minimum-maximum o <b>set</b> <b>intervals,</b> to deal with multiperiod systems, where xed o set values are insu cient.

The neutrosophic set is a powerful general formal framework that has been recently proposed. However, the neutrosophic set needs to be specified from a technical point of view. Now we define the set-theoretic operators on an instance of a neutrosophic set, and call it an <b>Interval</b> Neutrosophic <b>Set</b> (INS). We prove various properties of INS, which are connected to operations and relations over INS.

40|$|In {{this book}} we use only special types of {{intervals}} and introduce {{the notion of}} different types of interval linear algebras and interval vector spaces using the intervals of the form [0, a] where the intervals are from Zn or Z+ ∪ 0 or Q+ ∪ 0 or R+ ∪ 0. A systematic development is made starting from <b>set</b> <b>interval</b> vector spaces to group interval vector spaces. Vector spaces are taken as interval polynomials or interval matrices or just <b>intervals</b> over suitable <b>sets</b> or semigroups or groups. Main feature of this book is the authors have given over 350 examples. This book has six chapters. Chapter one is introductory in nature. Chapter two introduces the notion of <b>set</b> <b>interval</b> linear algebras of type one and two. <b>Set</b> fuzzy <b>interval</b> linear algebras and their algebras and their properties are discussed in chapter three. Chapter four introduces several types of interval linear bialgebras and bivector spaces and studies them. The possible applications are given in chapter five.
