25|$|The {{hormonal}} neuropeptides vasopressin and oxytocin play a {{key role}} in complex social behaviours in many mammals such as regulating attachment, <b>social</b> <b>recognition,</b> and aggression. Vasopressin has been implicated in male-typical social behaviors which includes aggression. Oxytocin may have a particular role in regulating female bonds with offspring and mates, including the use of protective aggression. Initial studies in humans suggest some similar effects.|$|E
40|$|Visual {{recognition}} of object, faces, and animals {{is done with}} ease and speed (eg Thorpe et al, 1996 Nature 381 520 - 522). Similarly important for human life is the visual <b>recognition</b> of <b>social</b> interactions (the physical interaction of an individual with others). Little is known about <b>social</b> interaction <b>recognition</b> and how it compares to visual object recognition. One prediction is that <b>social</b> interaction <b>recognition,</b> unlike object recognition, requires the {{recognition of}} how objects/humans are {{related to each other}} (eg, is the arm reached out for hitting or hand shaking?) in addition to the recognition of individual objects/humans. Hence, the visual <b>recognition</b> of <b>social</b> interactions might take longer. Here we compared the time course of visual object and <b>social</b> interaction <b>recognition.</b> We measured the presentation time thresholds to recognise static images depicting objects or social interactions with 80 certainty.

25|$|All {{universities}} {{suffered from}} lack of resources but some of {{this was due to}} corruption. In 2009/10, AAU staff thought nepotism, patronage and abuse of resources was widespread. They noted that the number of administrators driving expensive cars around campus had increased. Inadequate planning from both government and universities allowed resource abuse to occur. Corruption was encouraged by <b>social</b> <b>recognition</b> for wealth and power rather than academic excellence. Some professors were opening private colleges and advising their students to attend them. Teachers were often absent from class and moonlighting to make up for poor pay. Teachers might award marks based on favoritism or ethnic and religious relationships. In on case, a female student reported an administrator for demanding sexual favors in exchange for passing her grade to the registrar. The administration could change a fail to a pass at the student's request. Corruption and lack of transparency were also observed at MU.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that social cognition deficits, and impaired social functioning, were associated with schizophrenia. However, specificity of the relationships between <b>social</b> cues <b>recognition</b> and <b>social</b> functioning remain largely undefined. The authors speculated that the two were related, and further that recognition of verbal and non-verbal social cues were impaired in people with schizophrenia. A total of 71 people (40 schizophrenia patients and 31 matched normal controls) voluntarily participated in this study. <b>Social</b> cues <b>recognition</b> abilities were measured by the eye gaze discrimination task and the faux pas <b>recognition</b> task. <b>Social</b> functioning was assessed using the Social Functioning Scale. Correlation analysis revealed a significant association between faux pas and, in particular, the social functioning subscales of the Social Functioning Scale (independence and employment) in patients with schizophrenia. Furthermore, the authors also observed that clinical participants performed significantly worse in both the eye gaze discrimination and faux pas recognition tasks than their healthy counterparts. These findings suggested that impaired <b>social</b> cues <b>recognition</b> in people with schizophrenia may be a possible explanation for their impaired social functioning. © 2007 The Authors. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Some organisms are pelagic, swimming or drifting in mid-ocean, while others are benthic, living on or near the seabed. Their growth rates and metabolisms tend to be slow, their eyes may be very large to detect what little illumination there is, or they may be blind and rely on other sensory inputs. A number of deep sea creatures are bioluminescent; this serves a variety of functions including predation, protection and <b>social</b> <b>recognition.</b> In general, the bodies of animals living at great depths are adapted to high pressure environments by having pressure-resistant biomolecules and small organic molecules present in their cells known as piezolytes, which give the proteins the flexibility they need.

The New York Times praised her performance– [...] "one of the loveliest voices that ever issued from a human throat ... simply delicious in its fullness, richness and purity"– but the work was out of fashion, and the performances were poorly attended. Her performance in Roméo et Juliette, later in the season, was a triumph and established her as the leading prima donna of the time in succession to Adelina Patti.

In reference to the triple wedding, he says, [...] "The festive conclusion in A Midsummer Night's Dream depends upon the success of a process by which the feminine pride and power manifested in Amazon warriors, possessive mothers, unruly wives, and wilful daughters are brought under the control of lords and husbands." [...] He says that the consummation of marriage is how power over a woman changes hands from father to husband. A connection between flowers and sexuality is drawn.

30|$|Model 11 {{tests the}} {{interaction}} effect of classification homogeneity, social relation, and social prestige. The interaction term of classification homogeneity and social prestige is significant and positive (p[*]<[*] 0.05), showing that classification homogeneity strengthens {{the influence of}} the logic of <b>social</b> prestige <b>recognition</b> and helps focal firms extend their trust radius. In the social context with strong equality and qualification recognition, focal firms are inclined to develop cognitive trust based on social prestige and to promote their trust to out-group partners. This result confirms research hypothesis 2. Model 12, Model 13, and Model 14 are full model tests, which show that the logic of particularist guanxi operations and the logic of <b>social</b> prestige <b>recognition</b> can coexist and independently operate in overlapping social contexts, though the kinship proximity, to some extent, restrains the positive influence of social prestige on the trust radius of the enterprise.|$|R
