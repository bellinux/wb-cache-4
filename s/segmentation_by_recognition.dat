This method extracts multi-dimensional features from on-line strokes of handwritten text and applies the SVM to the ex-tracted features to produces segmentation point candidates. We incorporate the method into the <b>segmentation</b> <b>by</b> <b>recognition</b> scheme based on a stochastic model which evaluates the likelihood composed of character pattern structure, character segmentation, character recognition and context to finally determine segmentation points and recognize handwritten Japanese text. This paper also shows the details of generating segmentation point candidates {{in order to achieve}} high discrimination rate by finding the combination of the segmentation threshold and the concatenation threshold. We compare the method for segmen-tation by the SVM with that by a neural network using the database HANDS-Kondate_t_bf- 2001 - 11 and show the result that the method by the SVM bring about a better segmentation rate and character recognition rate. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} separating online handwritten patterns into Japanese text, figures and mathematical formulas. Today, Tablet PCs and electronic whiteboards provide much larger writing area for pen interfaces unlike PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants), through which users can easily input text, write mathematical formulas and draw figures on the screen. The fact that these objects can be written by a single pen (marker) without switching the device, mode, software or whatever else, and without any writing restrictions such as grids or boxes {{is one of the}} most important benefits of the pen interfaces. However, the task of segmenting these objects is challenging. To address this issue, we have applied a probabilistic model employing stroke features, stroke crossings and stroke densities. Further, we partially apply the approach of <b>segmentation</b> <b>by</b> <b>recognition.</b> Although the current recognizer for formulas is not a true recognizer, we have achieved about 81 % correct segmentation for all the strokes when applied to our newly prepared database of mixed patterns. This method has been compared with a neural-network. The results show that our method is generally better but less effective in distinguishing figures from other components...|$|E
40|$|Drawing {{has been}} a natural way for humans to express their {{thoughts}} and ideas since ancient times. People got used to create and understand illustrations. Many wellde ned formal notations have evolved including technical drawings, musical scores, and various diagrams. On the other hand, people use free-form sketches or ad hoc intuitive notations often. Electronic devices equipped with a touch screen take part in our daily lives and make {{it is easier to}} create and share drawings. Naturally, it is more and more desired to have methods for automatic recognition and understanding of drawings. It is much easier and desired in the case of formal drawings consisting of well de ned entities. A computer system can work further with such recognized drawing { beautify the drawing, rearrange a diagram, perform some actions according to a diagram, or manufacture something according to a technical drawing. On the other hand, it is extremely di cult and potentially unnecessary in the case of free-form sketches. It is often enough to provide the user with tools for easier creation and manipulation with sketches. The reason is that these sketches are meant to be understood by humans only and the computer system serves for their creation, storage, and sharing. Obviously, we can classify drawing into formal drawings and free-from sketching. This thesis deals with two tasks: recognition of formally de ned diagrams and segmentation of object of interest in free-form sketches. These two apparently di erent topics are strongly related. We assume that the drawing is created on an electronic device and thus it is in form of a sequence of strokes rather than a raster image. We propose a recognition framework for arrow-connected diagrams. We introduce a model for recognition by selection of symbol candidates, based on evaluation of relations between candidates using a set of predicates. It is suitable for simpler structures, in which the relations are explicitly given by symbols, arrows in the case of diagrams. Knowledge of a speci c diagram domain is used. The two domains are owcharts and nite automata. We created a benchmark database of diagrams from these two domains. Although the individual pipeline steps are tailored for these, the system can be readily adapted for other domains. The recognition pipeline consists of the following major steps: text/non-text separation, symbol segmentation, symbol classi cation, and structural analysis. We performed a comparison with state-of-the-art methods for recognition of owcharts and nite automata and veri ed that our approach outperforms them. We also analysed our system thoroughly and identi ed most frequent causes of recognition failures. The situation is more complicated {{in the case of a}} free-from sketching where the user can draw and write anything freely. We cannot expect any particular structure. We can often nd a combination of pictorial drawing with more structured gures and text in form of labels. The classical <b>segmentation</b> <b>by</b> <b>recognition</b> can not be used here. In some cases, the understanding of a sketch might be di cult even for humans. Speci cally, the identi cation of an individual object in a drawing may di er from user to user, case to case. Recent research showed that a single linkage agglomerative clustering of strokes with trainable distance function can be used for segmentation of objects from prede ned symbol classes in formal drawings. The proper distance function can be learned from annotated data. It requires a lot of data and time. We propose an approach combining several pre-trained distance functions for particular structures together to segment object in free-form sketches. We show that the desired segmentation can be achieved in many cases by combining together distance functions trained for very general object types like rows, columns, words, or compact images. We also show that the best combination of distance functions can be found from a very limited data in real time. We propose a segmentation approach, which estimates the optimal combination of clustering distance functions from an initial selection of one object. It results in segmentation of objects, which have similar characteristics to the initial one. Based on this approach, we designed a selection tool bringing additional functionality allowing to select and manipulate the segmented objects seamlessly. The method is suitable for fast rearrangement of sketches during collaborative content creation (brainstorming). Katedra kybernetik...|$|E

40|$|We {{will argue}} that the {{beginnings}} of words are perceptual "islands of reliability" in connected speech, and that their perceptual and temporal properties allow them to drive critical aspects of spoken word recognition including lexical segmentation. This argument rests on three generalizations derived from research in speech science, phonology, and psycholinguistics. We suggest that word onsets differ from other parts of words in that: (1) they offer more robust and redundant acoustic evidence about phonetic features, (2) they are generally protected from phonological assimilation, neutralization and deletion and therefore show less lawful variation in surface realization, and (3) they may activate lexical representations which facilitate word perception and thus diminish listeners' dependence on veridical acousticphonetic processing of other portions of words. These properties of word onsets allow them to drive lexical <b>segmentation</b> <b>by</b> facilitating the <b>recognition</b> of items that begin with clear onsets.

The currently available CAPTCHAs have been broken with varying success, using the weakness in the methods used to generate the images.

40|$|Perceptual {{grouping}} is {{the organization}} of visual elements into groups which depict an increased level of regularity. Gestalt psychologists posited that visual elements should be grouped based on certain laws including proximity, good continuation, symmetry, among others, {{in such a way}} as to generate “good form”. While these ideas are intuitive and appealing, their implementation as a computational framework has been challenging. A classical approach [12, 3, 9, 6] aims to capture these constraints by quantifying the local interaction of edge elements in a global optimization scheme, using curves as the intermediate-level representation. While the use of curves to embed local interactions among edges has led to significant progress, the results of these schemes also indicate that additional information, both local and global, is needed to disambiguate groupings. In general, the segregation of “figure from ground”, or the segmentation problem, remain unsolved with strong indications that a purely low-level processing solution is not always possible. Object recognition is the retrieval of the most similar category to a given “figure ” from a database of stored models. Two main approaches dominate previous work on recognition: bottom-up approaches advocate <b>segmentation</b> followed <b>by</b> <b>recognition,</b> while top-down approaches utilize low-level features to select models which are then matched against the image. The drawback of a purely bottom up approach is that segmentation is generally not possible, except under controlled environments or for restricted application domains. The drawback of a purely top-down approach is the complexity of the process in the face of numerous combinations of possibilities. The notion that visual organizatio...|$|R
40|$|Services {{provided}} by Internet allow {{the creation of}} new distance applications, as remote laboratories (Weblabs). In this context, the broadcasting of video and images are essential for the success and effectiveness of the experiments. However, the bandwidth of the communication channel does not allow transmission of high-definition video in real-time, which are basic requirements for remote monitoring and actuation activities. Considering a Weblab, also called Webbee, through which it is intended to analyze the behavior of bees, these requirements become more important. Commercial videos, CODEC (MPEG 4 and WMV), applied to videos of bees reduce the bitrates, as well as the quality, what makes impracticable the applications for the Webbee. Therefore, this paper presents the proposal of a new algorithm for codification of video of bees and the reduction of bitrates, maintaining the quality of the information. The algorithm includes the video <b>segmentation</b> process <b>by</b> identification, <b>recognition</b> and tracking of objects.

Firstly, the HIM has a coarse-to-fine representation which is capable of capturing long-range dependency and exploiting different levels of contextual information (similar to how natural language models represent sentence structure in terms of hierarchical representations such as verb and noun phrases). Secondly, {{the structure of the}} HIM allows us to design a rapid inference algorithm, based on dynamic programming, which yields the first polynomial time algorithm for image labeling. Thirdly, we learn the HIM efficiently using machine learning methods from a labeled dataset. We demonstrate that the HIM is comparable with the state-of-the-art methods by evaluation on the challenging public MSRC and PASCAL VOC 2007 image datasets. I...|$|R

However, the first step in on-line face recognition from a video sequence, involves automatic detection and face <b>segmentation</b> followed <b>by</b> face <b>recognition</b> using the segmented face. Detecting and segmenting a face image efficiently in real time from a video sequence, suitable for recognition, invariant to variations in scale, pose and shape of the face from a cluttered background is still a challenging problem.

In this work we present a novel approach for detecting and segmenting a face in real time from a video sequence. The segmented face is then handed over to a recognition algorithm We first obtain a coarse face region using skin colour, then using dynamic template matching the face is efficiently segmented at varying scale and pose in real time.

40|$|Abstract—In this work, {{we address}} the problem of {{performing}} class-specific unsupervised object segmentation, i. e., automatic segmentation without annotated training images. Object segmentation can be regarded as a special data clustering problem where both class-specific information and local texture/color similarities have to be considered. To this end, we propose a hybrid graph model (HGM) that can make effective use of both symmetric and asymmetric relationship among samples. The vertices of a hybrid graph represent the samples and are connected by directed edges and/or undirected ones, which represent the asymmetric and/or symmetric relationship between them, respectively. When applied to object segmentation, vertices are superpixels, the asymmetric relationship is the conditional dependence of occurrence, and the symmetric relationship is the color/texture similarity. By combining the Markov chain formed by the directed subgraph and the minimal cut of the undirected subgraph, the object boundaries can be determined for each image. Using the HGM, we can conveniently achieve simultaneous <b>segmentation</b> and <b>recognition</b> <b>by</b> integrating both top-down and bottom-up information into a unified process. Experiments on 42 object classes (9, 415 images in total) show promising results. Index Terms—Segmentation, graph-theoretic methods, spectral clustering. Ç...|$|R

Our data suggest that <b>segmentation</b> <b>by</b> motion proceeds first via a cooperative linking over space of local motion signals, generating almost immediate perceptual coherence even of physically incoherent signals.

40|$|Critical {{rainfall}} thresholds for landslides {{are powerful}} tools for preventing landslide hazard. The thresholds are commonly estimated empirically starting from rainfall events that triggered landslides in the past. The {{creation of the}} appropriate rainfall–landslide database {{is one of the}} main efforts in this approach. In fact, an accurate agreement between the landslide and rainfall information, in terms of location and timing, is essential in order to correctly estimate the rainfall–landslide relationships. A further issue is taking into account the average moisture conditions prior the triggering event, which reasonably may be crucial in determining the sufficient amount of precipitation. In this context, the aim of this paper is exploiting historical landslide and rainfall data in a spatial database for the derivation of critical rainfall thresholds for landslide occurrence in Sicily, southern Italy. The hourly rainfall events that caused landslides occurred in the twentieth century were specifically identified and reconstructed. A procedure was proposed to automatically convert rain guages charts recorded on paper tape into digital format and then to provide the cumulative rainfall hyetograph in digital format. This procedure is based on a <b>segmentation</b> followed <b>by</b> signal <b>recognition</b> techniques which allow to digitalize and to recognize the hyetograph automatically. The role of rainfall prior to the landslide events was taken into account by including in the analysis the rainfall occurred 5, 15 and 30 days before each landslide.

The obtained thresholds resulted in agreement with the regional curves proposed by other authors for the same area; antecedent rainfall turned out to be particularly important in triggering landslides...|$|R
