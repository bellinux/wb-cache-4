40|$|Introduction. This study {{addresses}} the rote of circulatory u-PA {{in the prevention}} and precipitation of arterial thrombosis. u-PA occurs in three forms: the inactive zymogen scu-PA, the active enzyme tcu-PA and u-PA#, the inactive complex of tcu-PA with inhibitors. In apparently healthy individuals (n= 50) scu-PA amounts 2. 2 ± 0. 4 ng/ml, u-PA# 1. 1 ± 0. 8 ng/ml and the concentration of tcu-PA is neglectable. Methods. 3043 AP patients from all over Europe (ECAT AP Study) were followed for two years for the occurrence of coronary events. Blood collection and angiographie assessment {{of the severity of}} the disease (VESS, the number of more than 50 % occluded coronary vessels of the patient) were performed on admission. u-PA analysis was performed centrally, on 2410 patients. Total u-PA Ag was measured by ELISA. scu-PA by BIA. and u-PA# was calculated as the difference between the two. Statistics: ANOVA, multiple regression analysis; partial correlation coefficients p are provided. Results. AP patients have on average a lower scu-PA (1. 9 ± 0. 5 ng/ml) and a higher u-PA# level (1. 6 ± 0. 6 ng/ml) than healthy individuals (P< 0. 001). The scu-PA level varies significantly between medical centres in Europe (range of means 1. 3 - 2. 3 ng/ml, 14 centres, P< 0. 001), and is negatively correlated (p = - 0. 32, P< 0. 001) with the event rate of the centres, which ranges from 1. 5 to 7. 0 events per 100 patients. By comparison, LDL cholesterol is positively correlated with the event rate (p = 0. 13, P< 0. 001) and u-PA# is not correlated. However, scu-PA, and also LDL chol, are not correlated with the risk of an event as such, but with VESS, the <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>occlusion</b> (scu-PA negatively: p = - 0. 08, P= 0. 001; LDL chol positively: p = 0. 16, P< 0. 001). The risk of an event is correlated with u-PA# and VESS, both positively, without any association between the two (u-PA#: p = 0. 10, P= 0. 004; VESS: p = 0. 13, P< 0. 001). The effects of a scries of known risk factors are subordinate to those of u-PA# and VESS, and are annihilated in competition therewith. The risk of an event in the highest u-PA# quintile relative to the lowest is 2. 6, and the standardized relative risk is 1. 5. For VESS these figures amount 5. 1 and 1. 8, respectively. Discussion: scu-PA is negatively correlated with the <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>occlusion</b> of the patients and with the event rate of the centres. We propose that the subnormal blood scu-PA levels, which are indicative of an impaired fibrinolytic potency and a resulting intensified thrombotic tendency, are of causative importance in the long-term evolution of AP. u-PA# is a novel risk marker, which is not associated with the <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>occlusion.</b> We suggest that the supernormal blood u-PA# levels reflect another aspect of the severity of the patient's condition, such as vascular resistance...|$|E
40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{ascertain}} the relationship of expressive vocal behavior in a structured interview and the severity of coronary artery disease {{in a group of}} 79 patients referred for coronary angiography. One half of the structured interview was administered in a nonchal-lenging manner, the other half in a moderately challenging manner. In patients age 60 and younger, two speech measures derived from the nonchallenging interview, a computer-scored index of the frequency of simultaneous speech and judged loudness level, accounted for 38 % {{of the variance in the}} patients ' severity of stenosis scores, when the latter was indexed by the Gensini method. The same speech indices derived from the challenging interview segment accounted for only 18 % of the variance on the patients ' Gensini scores.

40|$|The {{relation}} of angiographically recognized coronary occlusion to regional myocardial blood flow {{has not been}} studied adequately {{in spite of its}} clinical significance. This is particularly important, as revascularization procedures, based on angiographic studies, are being performed with increasing frequency. To compare the severity of reduction in flow to the <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>occlusion,</b> regional myocardial blood flow (85 -Kr washout) was measured in 34 patients. Selective coronary anteriograms were obtained using the Sones technique, and occlusions were graded as a percentage of luminal diameter. Of 26 right coronary arteries for which satisfactory arteriograms and coronary blood flow measurements were obtained, 16 were normal and 10 had significant stenosis (greater than 50 %). Dominant right coronary arteries appeared to have high flows (67 plus or minus 6 ml min-minus 1 per 100 g muscle) and a greater incidence of occlusion (10 of 20) than nondominant arteries, which had less flow (41 plus or minus 2 ml min-minus 1 per 100 g muscle) and a lower incidence of occlusion (1 of 8). Coronary blood flow in 16 normal left coronary arteries was 84 plus or minus 5 ml min-minus 1 per 100 g muscle and in 15 with 50 per cent or greater occlusion, 68 plus or minus 3 ml min-minus 1 per 100 g muscle.

40|$|Background and Aim: Growing {{clinical}} {{evidence suggests that}} inflammation {{is the hallmark of}} the initiation, progression and extent of occlusion by atherosclerosis plaques, but biochemical data are still controversial. The aim of the present cross-sectional investigation was to evaluate the relationship between the <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> artery <b>occlusion</b> (CAO), serum amyloid A (SAA), and interleukin - 6 (IL- 6) Materials and Methods: The subjects assessed were 165 having stable coronary artery disease, but without left main artery lesion. Angiographic examination revealed that 37 subjects had minimal CAO (control group), 41 one CAO, 41 two CAO, and 47 three CAO. The Subjects’ SAA and IL- 6 were assessed by means of ELISA. The level of fibrinogen was estimated using coaglumetry. The obtained data was analysed by means of SPSS (v: 13). Results: Fibrinogen concentrations were significantly higher in subjects with 1, 2 or 3 CAO compared to the controls. SAA levels in the subjects were higher than those in the controls, but the differences were not statistically significant. On the other hand, IL 6 - concentrations in patients with a varying degree of CAO were similar but slightly lower than those in the controls. Significant correlations were distinguished between SAA, IL- 6, and fibrinogen in the patients as a whole (p= 0. 05). Fibrinogen levels in the patients were significantly correlated with HDL and LDL.

40|$|AbstractBackground and purpose: Coronary {{heart disease}} (CHD) is a multifactorial {{disorder}} with over 250 different known risk factors. Advancing age, male gender, dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and cigarette smoking {{are the major}} and independent risk factors for CHD. The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess the association between anthropometric and clinically observed variables relative to the severity of CHD in 260 angiographic defined patients. Methods and Materials: Subjects with one or more lesion that narrowed the lumen of any coronary artery more than 70 % were considered to be CHD cases, whereas those without any significant narrowing ( 10 %) were taken as controls. The <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>occlusion</b> was scored on the bases of the number and the extent of lesions. Fasting serum concentrations of glucose, triglycerides, total and HDL cholesterol were determined. Anthropometrics parameters were collected by questionnaires. The Framingham scores, relative and absolute risks for CHD were calculated on the basis of the Framingham's points for the major risk factors. Results: The group with CHD was older than the group without CHD (57. 0  10. 2 vs. 51. 1  10. 3, P 0. 000). CHD was more prevalent in men than women (78. 2 % vs. 51. 6 %, P 0. 000). There was no statistically significant difference between two groups in body mass index, education and systolic and diastolic blood pressures. The prevalence of hypertension, physical inactivity, cigarette smoking, and diabetes mellitus was more in CHD+ cases than controls. Patients with CHD compared with the controls had increased serum levels of triglycerides (231. 7  180. 1 vs. 176. 3  101. 9, P 0. 003), total cholesterol (205. 2  60. 8 vs. 193. 9  41. 0, P 0. 08), LDL cholesterol (128. 8  59. 2 vs. 119. 8  33. 6, P 0. 2) and decreased serum levels of HDL cholesterol (42. 3  13. 3 vs. 39. 7  11. 3, P 0. 1). The higher prevalence of major cardiovasular risk factors were found in the subgroup of patients with more extensive CHD. The Framingham scores (8. 7  4. 4 vs. 5. 7  4. 8, P 0. 000), relative risk (2. 5  1. 3 vs. 1. 6  0. 7, P 0. 000) and absolute risk (14. 8  8. 6 vs. 8. 1  6. 7, P 0. 000) were higher in CHD patients than controls. On multiple logistic regression analysis, the best markers for discriminating between CHD and control subjects were age (OR= 1. 06, P 0. 001), male gender (OR= 4. 51, P 0. 000), smoking (OR= 3. 56, P 0. 05), diabetes mellitus (OR= 7. 76, P 0. 000) and cholesterol (OR= 1. 009, P 0. 02).

40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether the cardioprotective effects of ischemic preconditioning can be reinstated once they are lost in a rat model <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>occlusion.</b> Background. We have shown in a previous study that the cardioprotective effects of preconditioning are lost if there is a time lag (≥ 1 h) between the preconditioning and sustained <b>coronary</b> <b>occlusion</b> events in the rat. However, whether the beneficial effects of preconditioning can be regained once they are lost in this model is unknown. Methods. Twenty-eight rats were randomized to one of four groups. Group 1 (control group) underwent 90 min <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>occlusion</b> without preconditioning. Group 2 had preconditioning (three cycles of 3 min <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>occlusion</b> and 5 min of reperfusion) that was immediately followed by 90 min <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>occlusion.</b> In group 3, 90 min of occlusion was delayed by 1 h after preconditioning. In group 4, preconditioning was repeated 1 h after a first preconditioning sequence, followed by 90 min of occlusion. After 4 h of reperfusion, the area at risk was delineated by intravenous injection of blue dye during a brief <b>coronary</b> <b>occlusion,</b> and the area of necrosis was determined by the triphenyltetrazolium chloride technique. Results. Myocardial infarct size, expressed as a percent of the anatomic area at risk in groups 1 and 3 averaged 44. 1 ± 6. 9 % (mean ± SEM) and 49. 9 ± 6. 9 %, respectively. In contrast, groups 2 and 4 (12. 1 ± 3. 2 % and 10. 1 ± 2. 6 %, respectively) had a significantly smaller infarct size (p < 0. 01 vs. groups 1 and 3). The incidence of ventricular tachycardia during the 90 min <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>occlusion</b> in both groups 2 and 4 (14. 3 %, p < 0. 005 and 28. 6 %, p < 0. 05, respectively) was significantly lower than in groups 1 and 3 (100 % in both groups).

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{increased}} cholinergic activity on reperfusion induced ventricular arrhythmias was studied in alpha chloralose anaesthetised dogs by administering neostigmine during a 25 min occlusion of the anterior left descending coronary artery. The dogs {{were divided into}} five groups, each of 10 animals: the control group received only saline solution; group 1 neostigmine 0. 03 mg. kg- 1 iv at 20 min <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>occlusion</b> (that is, 5 min before reperfusion); group 2 atropine 0. 4 mg. kg- 1 iv at 10 min <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>occlusion</b> and neostigmine 0. 03 mg. kg- 1 iv at 20 min; and group 3 neostigmine 0. 03 mg. kg- 1 iv at 20 min <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>occlusion</b> {{and at the same}} time underwent atrial pacing at the same rate as that of the sinus node just before neostigmine administration. In group 4 heart rate was slowed (junctional rhythm) by destroying the sinus node at 20 min <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>occlusion.</b> The results obtained showed that ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, which occur at the beginning of reperfusion, were significantly less frequent in group 1 (p less than 0. 001) and in group 4 (p less than 0. 001). The protective action of neostigmine was abolished by previous administration of atropine (group 2) and modified by preventing the decrease in the heart rate by atrial pacing (group 3). In group 3 ventricular tachycardia was more frequent but the incidence of ventricular fibrillation was reduced significantly compared with the control and atropine groups. Thus cholinergic activity has a protective role in reperfusion arrhythmias by decreasing the heart rate before release <b>of</b> the <b>coronary</b> <b>occlusion</b> and therefore reduces the incidence of ventricular fibrillation...|$|R

However, it is very rare and is sometimes difficult to diagnose correctly. A 30 -year-old male patient with suspected unstable angina pectoris who received catheterization in 1999 had normal coronary artery but positive result in the provocation test of vasospasm. Although his angina had been suppressed by medications, he suffered ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction after the discontinuation of medication. The initial angiogram showed total occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery. Thrombolysis and nitroglycerin achieved recanalization of the culprit lesion with only mild residual stenosis. Angioscopy revealed normal white luminal wall without any thrombogenic lesion. Therefore, the cause <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>occlusion</b> was diagnosed as vasospasm. However, since the repeated vasospastic occlusion of the culprit lesion regardless of repeated intra-coronary injection of nitroglycerin was observed, a stent was implanted and vasospasm was successfully prevented. It is not easy to judge from the angiogram that the cause <b>of</b> <b>coronary</b> <b>occlusion</b> in the patients with acute myocardial infarction is vasospasm. It is important to think routinely about the possibility of vasospasm as a cause of acute myocardial infarction. <Learning objective: In a patient with acute myocardial infarction caused by vasospasm, angioscopy revealed normal white luminal vessel wall without any thrombogenic lesion at the culprit, although the initial angiogram suggested the presence of thrombus.
