The objective of this work was to analyze quantitative and qualitative OM stock variations and to characterize organic compartments in a clayey Dark-Red Latosol under situations of natural savanna vegetation (CER), long-term (PAL) and degraded grasslands (PAD), and fallow conditions (PAC). These were compared with crops under conventional plowing (CCL) and zero tillage (PD). Small organic <b>stock</b> <b>variation</b> was found in surface layer of studied soils, explained by human disturbance of vegetation in CER, no residue exportation in PD and CCL, and by fallow practice in PAC.

Annual carbon source and sink distributions are simulated {{for the same}} period using various spatial datasets including land cover and leaf area index (LAI) obtained from remote sensing, soil texture, climate, forest age, and nitrogen deposition. During 1901 - 1949, China's forests were a source of 21. 0 +/- 7. STgCyr(- 1) due to disturbances (human activities). Its size increased to 122. 3 +/- 25. 3 TgCyr(- 1) during 1950 - 1987 due to intensified human activities in the late 1950 s, early 1960 s, 1970 s and early 1980 s. The forests became large sinks of 176. 7 +/- 44. 8 TgCyr(- 1) during 1988 - 2001, owing to large-scale plantation and forest regrowth in previously disturbed areas as well as growth stimulation by nondisturbance factors such as climatic warming, atmospheric CO, fertilization, and N deposition. From 1901 to 2001, China's forests were a small carbon source of 3. 32 PgC, about 32. 9 +/- 22. 3 TgCyr(- 1). The overall C balance in biomass from InTEC generally agrees with previous results derived from forest inventories of China's forests. InTEC results also include C <b>stock</b> <b>variation</b> in soils and are therefore more comprehensive than previous results.

30|$|Considering the {{different}} <b>stock</b> <b>variation</b> patterns of anchovy and sardine in the CCS, we {{speculate that the}} regime shift should have opposite impacts on their populations. Consequently, some studies imply that the change of ocean environment associated with the 1976 – 1977 regime shift triggered a species replacement (Benson and Trites 2002; Chavez et al. 2003). Hare and Mantua (2000) reported that survival of age- 0 anchovy on the US west coast decreased after the regime shift. They also describe the decrease of zooplankton abundance. Their suggestion that the regime shift lowered anchovy survival via reduced food availability can be tested using a coupled modeling framework. Fiechter et al. (2015), using the same model as used here, identified periods of enhanced adult anchovy growth associated with increased prey availability in the CCS leading to increased egg production. Anchovy and sardine are both plankton feeders that occur from British Columbia to Baja California and can form mixed schools (Radovitch 1979). If the poor feeding condition caused a low age- 0 survival of anchovy, then we might expect that age- 0 survival of sardine was also low {{during the same time}} period. Previous studies, including the model used here, suggested that age- 0 survival exerts a significant control on adult sardine abundance via increased egg survival (i.e., reduced development time) during periods of warmer ocean conditions, such as those that occurred following the 1976 – 1977 regime shift (Fiechter et al. 2015). While sardine catch data in British Columbia did not show the apparent phase transition during the regime shift (McFarlane and Beamish, 1999), Barnes et al. (1992) suggested that age- 0 sardine improved in California during the 1970 s.|$|E

The long-term field experiment Qualiagro (INRA – Veolia Environnement) was established at Feucherolles, France, in 1998. Five treatments were designed and replicated in four blocks. Farmyard manure (FYM) and three types of composts (Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), Biowastes (BIOW) and Green Waste + Sewage Sludges (GWS)) were applied every two years at a rate of 4 t C ha- 1. A control received no organic amendment. Changes of total P stock in the plough layer (0 - 28 cm) were compared to cumulated soil P balance since 1998, calculated as the difference between cumulated P input, as supplied through organic amendment and at seedling, and cumulated P output, by harvest of grains and crop residues if removed. Total soil P content and bulk soil density were determined at five soil sampling dates, crop yield and P content were measured annually. Cumulated P input for the 1998 - 2013 period ranged from 340 to 1695 kg P ha- 1 for MSW and GWS respectively. Cumulated P export by crops was influenced by treatments.

40|$|The {{structural}} {{organization of}} a forest canopy is an important descriptor that may provide spatial information for vegetation mapping and management planning, such as attributes of plant species distributions, intensity of disturbances, aboveground biomass or carbon stock. A variety of airborne and satellite images characterize forest stands from above the canopy, providing {{the advantage of a}} rapid exploration of extensive and sometimes inaccessible zones. Unfortunately, this approach has limited applicability in wet tropical regions, because most optical and radar signals that deliver medium to high spatial resolution data will saturate at intermediate levels of biomass ranges (ca. 150200 t. ha&# 8722; 1) or leaf area index values (Gibbs et al. 2007). As a consequence, while forest vs. non-forest classifications are nowadays routinely performed from such data, variations in stand structure and biomass within forests of fairly closed canopy remain almost undetectable with classical techniques, and the forest treetops seen from above appear as a homogeneously undulating green carpet. However, rainforest structure varies substantially from place to place either naturally (as the soil, composition or forest dynamics vary) or from anthropogenic degradations. Detecting, characterizing and mapping these variations over vast areas are critical to emerging policies, such as the REDD+ agenda (Maniatis and Mollicone 2010), whereby participating countries will monitor their carbon <b>stock</b> <b>variation.</b> Although promising technology such as LiDAR (light detection and ranging) has great potential, they remain very expensive to systematically assess large expanses of tropical forests (but see Asner et al. 2010).

40|$|Conservation {{agriculture}} {{is one of}} the agro-environment measures promoted by the Veneto Region (North-eastern Italy) to regulate and support many ecosystem services. This study compared conventional and conservation agriculture management systems in order to evaluate their effects on both SOC stocks and quality i. e. humic C and its molecular weight fractions, microbial C and N. The experiment was set up in 2010 on three farms in Veneto Region. In order to improve the monitoring procedures, a massive soil sampling programme was conducted in 2011 and 2014 in ca. 150 positions, considering the SOC stratification within a 0 - 50 cm profile. Results suggested that conservation agriculture practices affected SOC distribution rather than its total amount. The retention of crop residues on the soil surface and the absence of tillage operations drove SOC dynamics in the top layer (0 - 5 cm) of the conservation system, while residues incorporation with ploughing was responsible for SOC accumulation at the 30 - 50 cm depth in the conventional one. SOC <b>stock</b> <b>variation</b> in the conservation treatment was also influenced by root C input, which was identified as a major factor able to promote SOC accumulation in the 0 - 30 cm profile. The role of clay on SOC dynamics was not uniform in the three farms since it depended both on the clay amount and its mineral composition. The strong interactions existing between management systems and local soil conditions were also confirmed by the C quality analyses. This research did not demonstrate the benefits of conservation practices on SOC sequestration during the transition period. However, SOC sequestration {{is only one of the}} numerous ecosystem services provided by conservation practices. Some of these depend on the C content and quality in the top layers that, as demonstrated in our work, were strongly affected by the C stratification processes triggered by conservation agriculture.

Research limitations/implications – The results lead us to explore further avenues in using other risk factors in asset pricing such as future work to consider other cross-sectional attributes such as the stochastic behaviour of earnings or profitability that might also produce common <b>variation</b> in <b>stock</b> returns. There may be other risk factors that carry a premium and thus can be used for asset pricing. Practical implications – The paper's findings are important in fund management when selecting or evaluating portfolio performance. The authors introduce an additional factor that has a sound theoretical appeal and show that leverage mimicking factor portfolios provide additional information in pricing assets, both in the cross section of all shares and in different sectors. Originality/value – To the best of the authors' knowledge this is the first study of the effect of leverage mimicking factor portfolios in explaining <b>stock</b> return <b>variations...</b>|$|R

[...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} role of cash flow in explaining <b>stock</b> price <b>variations</b> and the determination of equity premium after correcting for the measurement error of cash flow growth. In Chapter 1, we incorporate price-total payout (dividends plus repurchases) ratio into the models of Binsbergen and Koijen (2010) and Campbell and Ammer (1993) to reassess {{the role of}} cash flow in stock price movement. We find that the existing results of a high persistence in expected returns and a strong dependence of <b>stock</b> price <b>variation</b> on discount rates are partly attributable {{to the use of}} price-dividend ratio with measurement error as a predictor of stock returns. The incorporation of price-total payout ratio enables the models i) to improve an in-sample goodness of fit for return and cash flow growth, ii) to produce a lower persistence of expected returns, which leads to a smaller shock to stock prices from the discount rate channel, iii) to show a higher contribution of cash flow channel to stock price movement in terms of variations in price-cash flow ratio and unexpected return. These results apply to medium and large cap portfolios as well as to aggregate market index. In Chapter 2, we explore the effects on <b>stock</b> market <b>variation</b> of other factors than stock repurchases that could account for the non-stationarity of price-dividend ratio by incorporating regime shifts in the mean of price-total payout ratio into the models of Binsbergen and Koijen (2010) and Campbell and Ammer (1993). Compared to the results of Chapter 1, we achieve i) an improvement in in-sample goodness of fit for return and cash flow growth, ii) a lower persistence and higher volatility of expected returns, iii) stronger role of cash flow channel in <b>stock</b> market <b>variation,</b> all of which show that not only stock repurchases but also other structural factors such as persistent decline in consumption volatility affecting the relationship between stock prices and cash flows should be taken into account when we attempt to investigate the sources of <b>stock</b> price <b>variations.</b> In Chapter 3, we incorporate price-total payout ratio and endogenously generated consumption volatility with regime shifts into the dynamic asset pricing model of Bansal, Kiku, Shaliastovich, and Yaron (2014) (hereafter, “BKSY model”), which stresses the role of a sizable positive risk premium from the macroeconomic volatility channel in explaining the equity premium by introducing the volatility risk into traditional consumption-based asset pricing model. Our extension of the BKSY model provides a different identification of the consumption volatility risk by including the effects of the economic agent’s revision of expectation on the volatility states on each of three channels to determine the equity premium. From annual samples of 1930 to 2015, we find that our model shows a much smaller contribution of the consumption volatility risk to the total equity premium, most of which is now explained by the cash flow risk. This finding applies to cross-sectional portfolio returns as well as to aggregate market index return. Our model also indicates that the consumption volatility risk is not large enough to reverse a negative correlation between equity return and human capital return...|$|R
