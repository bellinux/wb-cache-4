40|$|A {{new design}} of front rolls in ring {{spinning}} frame is offered to improve properties of the yarn. Perforated bottom front roll accompanied by modification {{in the shape of}} the roller and its flutes is considered for better bounding of the fibers into yarn structure. Then, modified rollers are constructed and mounted in front of the prior front rolls. <b>Sample</b> ring <b>yarns</b> with count of 15 and 20 Ne were spun separately by means of new system with air suction (M. S. R. Y), without air suction (M. R. Y) and also, by means of ordinary front rolls (T. R. Y) to assess the effects of proposed design on the properties of the yarn. This paper presents the comparison of mechanical and qualitative characteristics of the spun yarns. Study shows that, new design of front rolls had positive influence on improving properties of the <b>samples.</b> <b>Yarn</b> <b>samples</b> were the same in terms of tenacity in 0. 05 level of significance but different in 0. 01.

30|$|The wash {{fastness}} {{results of}} all samples {{were found to}} be in the range of fairly good to good ratings of 3 – 5. Mordanting with different metal salts has significantly altered wash fastness ratings of dyed woolen yarn. Alum and ferrous sulfate positively affected the color change in wash fastness results but tin mordants reduce the rating up to 3. Fastness results are also proving the better complexation of iron mordant with wool fiber and dye molecules. The color change in dyed wool of all samples was found to be from fairly good to good level rating of 3 – 4, whereas the color staining on wool and cotton was found to be very good rating of 5. Color fastness to crocking was found to be within the range of 3 – 5 means fairly good to good level in all dyed <b>yarn</b> <b>samples.</b> Woolen <b>yarn</b> <b>samples</b> dyed with low concentration showed better wash and rub fastness properties. This is attributed to the fact that at higher dye concentration there is leeching of color from dyed wool samples due to physical adsorption. The results of present study are in good correlation with previously reported work by Ali et al. (2016).|$|R

40|$|The extract {{of leaves}} of henna was applied on woollen yarn to {{investigate}} the dyeing characteristics and antimicrobial efficacy against common human pathogens such as Escherichia coli MTCC 443, Staphylococcus aureus MTCC 902 and Candida albicans ATCC 90028. Bioactivity of henna dyed woollen yarn was compared with commercial antibacterial (Ampicillin) and antifungal (Fluconazole) agents. Lawsonia inermis dyed woollen <b>yarn</b> <b>samples</b> were found considerably active against tested microorganisms. Dyed wool yarns were tested for fastness toward light, washing and crocking (dry and wet). Fastness properties of dyed woollen <b>yarn</b> <b>samples</b> were found considerably good. Effect of eco-friendly metallic salt mordants on bioactivity and color characteristics of dyed woollen <b>yarn</b> <b>samples</b> were also investigated.

The main {{aim of this study}} is to determine the statistically significant descriptive parameters that have an effect on the breaking force and elongation of slub yarn using the full factorial design method. In addition, the effects of the significant parameters on the breaking force and elongation were investigated. Slub <b>yarn</b> <b>samples</b> were produced by using a ring spinning frame on which an original slub attachment was designed and mounted. After the samples were produced, dimensional measurements and image analysis were made. Then quality tests were applied to all samples and the results analysed.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a detailed study concerning {{the effects of}} chemicals like sodium hydroxide and environmental conditions such as temperature and time {{on the degradation of}} Poly lactic acid (PLA) as compared to Polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The aim is to study the effects of chemical and environmental conditions on the degradation of Poly lactic acids. In view of this, samples of PLA flat filament yarns and partially oriented PET yarns were hydrolysed with two different pH media i. e. neutral pH 7, and alkali pH 12. 0 - 13. 5 to study the physical changes that occurred in the yarn structure. Both the hydrolysed and non-hydrolysed yarns subjected to tensile test, DSC scans and FTIR analysis and the changes and the effects that took place before and after hydrolytic degradation at varied temperatures and times were analysed. The study showed that, at 60 o C and 90 o C hydrolysis yielded significant change in the physical appearance of the <b>sample</b> <b>yarns</b> as well as the structure. It could therefore be concluded that degradation highly occurred in the alkali medium than in the neutral medium when the time and temperatures were increased.

30|$|In {{the present}} study, Terminalia chebula (Myrobalan/Harda) natural dye extract {{was used for}} the {{development}} of eco-friendly shades on woolen yarn with different hues and tones. The effect of dye concentration on color strength (K/S) of woolen yarn dyed with T. chebula was assessed. Increasing the concentration of dye decreased lightness (L*) values of woolen <b>yarn</b> <b>samples,</b> indicating darker shades. Different metal salts such as alum, ferrous sulfate, and stannous chloride were used to enhance the fastness properties (light, wash, dry and wet rubs) of dyed woolen yarn. Pre-treatment of woolen <b>yarn</b> <b>samples</b> with metal salts has shown encouraging results with better fastness properties and enhanced color strength values. Five percent ferrous sulfate mordanted samples show greater saturation with increasing dye concentration from 0.5 to 15  % (o.w.f.).

40|$|The dyeing of {{woollen yarn}} with lac as natural dye {{has been studied}} using ferrous sulphate, stannous {{chloride}} and their combination as mordants. Fifty four shades have been produced by using different mordants and varying the amount of dye. The hue of colour ranges from light orange - red - dark scarlet. The colour strength (K/S) {{has been found to}} be very good in dyed woollen <b>yarn</b> <b>samples.</b> Colour fastness values with respect to light exposure, washing, rubbing were obtained following standard methods.

From the investigations and study of dyeing a database on the effect of different eco-friendly mordants and their combination on the depth of shades, colour values and fastness properties of woollen yarns dyed with lac dye was devised. Following conclusions can be drawn based on the experiments of dyeing: Application of lac dye on wool substrate produces a range of shades varying from light orange - bright red - dark scarlet depending on the amount of lac dye, eco friendly mordants and their combination used. Stannous chloride mordanted woollen yarn dyed with lac dye produced stronger colour depth in comparison to lac dyed woollen <b>yarn</b> <b>samples</b> mordanted with ferrous sulphate.

40|$|The {{present study}} about the {{behaviour}} of plain textiles {{used for the}} production of antimis (Christian-orthodox liturgical item used in the liturgy) to pilling explores the functional classification of different types of antimis as a textile product made out the following different types of fabrics: natural silk, flax, viscose, polyamide 6. 6. Pilling is a phenomenon which consists of the formation of small balls made out of fibre congeries on the textile’s surface due to attrition and fatigue. For textiles used as liturgical items, the process of pilling formation includes the following stages: the emergence of the pilling surfaces (the formation of fuzzy), fibre tangle (appearance of small balls), and the detachment of small balls from the fabric’s surface. The analysis method of pilling for liturgical items made out the four types of fabrics mentioned above consists of stereoscopic microscopy techniques and electronic microscopy methods (SEM). The images of textiles <b>samples</b> (<b>yarns</b> and fabrics) will be captured using a video microscope. Quantitative tests have been done to determine the metric number and the tex title of the above-mentioned fabrics. The increased resistance of silk to pilling compared to nylon, flax, and viscose {{can be attributed to the}} chemical properties of fibres and structural characteristics of silk fabric. The structural compactness of the same fiber mixture of natural silk fabric with bonded fabric will have a higher resistance coefficient to pilling compared to the other mentioned fabrics. Through this, the value of use and durability of the antimis will increase...|$|R
