5|$|Meanwhile in Frankfurt, imprisoned {{biochemist}} David Robert Jones is {{visited by}} his lawyer Mr. Kohl (James Frain), who tells Jones {{that the job}} in Philadelphia was successful. Jones tells Kohl to wire Loeb another $100,000, and he makes a list of items he needs Kohl to bring on his next visit. Olivia visits Raul's wife Susan Lugo (Rosa Arredondo) and claims to have met her before as well, but Susan does not remember their meeting. She <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> people at a meeting Olivia describes were Raul, Susan, and John Scott (Mark Valley). Olivia realizes that she apparently still has his memories inside of her head, and is mixing them up with her own. Over at Massive Dynamic, Nina Sharp's (Blair Brown) attempts to delve into Scott's memories for information hit a dead end {{when they find out}} that crucial pieces of his memories are missing; they soon discover that the memories they need are in Olivia's mind.|$|E

25|$|The Khazar state was, Oppenheim <b>says,</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> Jewish {{state to}} rise between the Fall of the Second Temple (67–70 CE) and the {{establishment}} of Israel (1948), and its example stimulated messianic aspirations for a return to Israel as early as Judah Halevi. In the time of the Egyptian vizier Al-Afdal Shahanshah (d.1121), one Solomon ben Duji, often identified as a Khazarian Jew, attempted to advocate for a messianic effort for the liberation of, and return of all Jews to, Palestine. He wrote to many Jewish communities to enlist support. He eventually moved to Kurdistan where his son Menachem some decades later assumed the title of Messiah and, raising an army for this purpose, took the fortress of Amadiya north of Mosul. His project was opposed by the rabbinical authorities and he was poisoned in his sleep. One theory maintains that the Star of David, until then a decorative motif or magical emblem, began to assume its national value in late Jewish tradition from its earlier symbolic use by Menachem.|$|E

25|$|However, Crest's {{origin point}} {{has also been}} erased, so the party heads to Balance Valley to restore it. There, they {{encounter}} Argo (Tomomichi Nishimura/Neil Ross), who tells them the young Crest has died, and only his apprentice, Lin (Fumiko Orikasa/Kim Mai Guest) remains. Max and Monica decide to rewrite Crest's history {{so as to avoid}} his death. They head to the Moon Crystal Lighthouse where he died, and travel into the past where they see Lin and Crest (Susumu Chiba/Scott McAfee) attacked by the warship Death Ark, captained by Gaspard (Takahiro Sakurai/Rino Romano), the man who killed Monica's father. They are unable to prevent Crest's death, but Lin, inspired by Crest's successful attempt to save the lighthouse's moon crystal, vows to become a legendary sage herself. Max and Monica go to the future, where they meet Madam Crest – an elderly Lin - who tells them Griffon comes from 10,000 years in the past. The atlamillia cannot make such a jump, and Lin <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> people capable of doing so are the scientists at the Luna Lab.|$|E
500|$|The four retrace the ambassador's {{movements}} that day, discovering {{that he had}} stopped at a bar before arriving at the hotel. Then, Stottlemeyer and Disher {{go back to the}} precinct {{to try to get a}} bead on Tennyson's location while Monk and Sharona discover that the ambassador's final words meant [...] "This is not my coat". Stottlemeyer breaks into Cage's office to discover that Tennyson is dying in a hospital and has days left to live. Stottlemeyer confronts Cage, who <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> way he will allow access to Tennyson is if Monk solves the ambassador's murder.|$|E
500|$|In the city, Wei {{finds the}} people that Zhang was {{supposed}} to be working with, only to discover that they had lost him at the train station days before. She forces another girl her age, Sun Zhimei, to help her look for Zhang at the train station, but they do not find him. Wei has no success finding Zhang through the public address system and [...] "missing person" [...] posters, so she goes to the local television station to broadcast a missing person notice. The receptionist (Feng Yuying) will not let her in without valid identification, though, and <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> way she can enter is with permission from the station manager, whom she describes as [...] "a man with glasses". For the rest of the day, Wei stands by the station's only gate, stopping every man with glasses, but she does not find the station manager, and spends the night asleep on the street. The next day the station manager (Wu Wanlu) sees her at the gate again, through his window, and lets her in, scolding the receptionist for making her wait outside.|$|E

2500|$|Nibs– Nibs is {{described}} as [...] "gay and [...] ", probably the bravest Lost Boy.

He's also the oldest and best looking Lost Boy.|$|E
2500|$|Unger {{therefore}} {{argues that}} different {{responses to these}} sorts of problems are based more on psychology than ethics – in this new case, he <b>says,</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> important {{difference is that the}} man in the yard does not seem particularly [...] "involved". Unger claims that people therefore believe the man is not [...] "fair game", but says that this lack of involvement in the scenario cannot make a moral difference.|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, Freeman {{criticized the}} celebration of Black History Month , saying, [...] "I don't want a black history month. Black history is American history." [...] He <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> way to end racism is to stop talking about it, and he notes {{that there is no}} [...] "white history month." [...] Freeman once said in an {{interview}} with 60 Minutess Mike Wallace, [...] "I am going to stop calling you a white man and I'm going to ask you to stop calling me a black man." [...] Freeman supported the defeated proposal to change the Mississippi state flag, which contains the Confederate battle flag. Freeman sparked controversy in 2011 when, on CNN's Piers Morgan Tonight, he accused the Tea Party movement of racism.|$|E
2500|$|As for the spell, Regina told Mary Margaret {{that the}} spell did work, and as {{suspected}} by David, Arthur lied to them, believing {{that he did}} not want to contact Merlin. Regina believes the only other person who was chosen by Merlin was the Author, meaning Henry, who is brought in to help them, adding that Emma is still inside the darkness and they can save her. Henry then places the mushroom in the cauldron and an image of Merlin appears, informing them that things are worse than he feared. Regina sourly notes they've gotten Merlin's [...] "voicemail". Merlin <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> way the Dark One can be defeated is by the Nimue, but before he can go any further, Merlin says the Dark One has found him already, and the message is cut short, leading the others to believe that Emma has done something to Merlin.|$|E

60|$|At Espiritu Santo much {{friendliness}} was shown, and a {{man would}} not take a present Mr. Atkin offered, because he had nothing, to pay for it. Santa Cruz, as usual, was disappointing, as, Mr. Atkin <b>says,</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> word in their mouths, the only thought in their heads, was 'iron;' they clamoured for this, and would not listen; moreover, their own pronunciation of their language was very indistinct, owing to their teeth being destroyed {{by the use of}} the betel-nut, so that they all spoke like a man with a hot potato in his mouth.|$|E

60|$|Apropos, as {{they say}} here, of refinement, there’s another American in the house—a gentleman from Boston—who’s just crammed with it. His name’s Mr. Louis Leverett (such a {{beautiful}} name I think) and he’s about thirty years old. He’s rather small and he looks pretty sick; he suffers from some affection of the liver. But his conversation leads you right on—they do go so far over here: even our people seem to strain ahead in Europe, and perhaps when I get back it may strike you I’ve learned {{to keep up with}} them. I delight to listen to him anyhow—he has such beautiful ideas. I feel as if these moments were hardly right, not being in French; but fortunately he uses a great many French expressions. It’s in a different style from the dazzle of Mr. Verdier—not so personal, but much more earnest: he <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> earnestness left in the world now is French. He’s intensely fond of pictures and has given me a great many ideas about them that I’d never have gained without him; I shouldn’t have known how to go to work to strike them. He thinks everything of pictures; he thinks we don’t make near enough of them. They seem to make a good deal of them here, but I couldn’t help telling him the other day that in Bangor I really don’t think we do.|$|E
