5|$|As White had {{expected}} the survivors to {{fight their way}} out of Ngok Tavak, he made the decision to leave the dead allied soldiers behind; the decision caused distress amongst the <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battle, but White believed evacuating the deceased soldiers through enemy lines would have been suicidal. After the Marines and Mobile Strike Force personnel had destroyed their unneeded equipment, they were directed to form an order-of-march out of Ngok Tavak, {{in order to protect the}} wounded and those with little infantry experience. Just before they left the garrison, Cameron blew up the first CH-46 helicopter that was still intact on the landing zone, using the M-72 anti-tank weapon.

Meanwhile, Riker dresses in the garb given to him for his dinner with Beata, Troi and Yar taunt him for dressing in clothes that sexualize him and in some ways demean him, and he is only doing it to win favor with Beata. He responds by saying he is honoring the local customs, and acknowledges Beata's beauty, and that the garb is rather comfortable.|$|E
