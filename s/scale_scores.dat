25|$|One of {{the most}} widely used instruments, the Rosenberg {{self-esteem}} scale (RSES) is a 10-item self-esteem <b>scale</b> <b>scores</b> that requires participants to indicate their level of agreement with a series of statements about themselves. An alternative measure, The Coopersmith Inventory uses a 50-question battery over a variety of topics and asks subjects whether they rate someone as similar or dissimilar to themselves. If a subject's answers demonstrate solid self-regard, the scale regards them as well adjusted. If those answers reveal some inner shame, it considers them to be prone to social deviance.|$|E

ProTECT, a phase II trial conducted in Atlanta at Grady Memorial Hospital in 2007, the first to show that progesterone reduces edema in humans. Since then, trials have moved on to phase III. The National Institute of Health began conducting a nationwide phase III trial in 2011 led by Emory University. A global phase III initiative called SyNAPSe®, initiated in June 2010, is run by a United States-based private pharmaceutical company, BHR Pharma, and is being conducted in the United States, Argentina, Europe, Israel and Asia. Approximately 1,200 patients with severe (Glasgow Coma <b>Scale</b> <b>scores</b> of 3-8), closed-head TBI will be enrolled in the study at nearly 150 medical centers.|$|E
25|$|Hull {{began working}} in {{aptitude}} testing after he began teaching Daniel Starch's {{class at the}} University of Wisconsin. His interest in the field was stimulated by his dissatisfaction with contemporary tests, believing them to be lacking in procedure and validity. His book on the subject, Aptitude Testing (1928), showed his work with analyzing validity and creating <b>scale</b> <b>scores.</b> He also created his own test, the Wisconsin Lathe Test. He created a computing machine to lessen the work of producing tables of test correlations. The machine interpreted data from punch cards to produce these tables. This machine would later influence his theories on behaviorism. Hull eventually became cynical regarding {{the future of the}} field, causing him to pursue other interests. Though no longer doing active research in the field, he retained an interest, debating Karl Lashley's beliefs on the heritability of intelligence.|$|E
50|$|There is no {{penalty for}} wrong answers.

25|$|This {{abridged}} {{version of the}} K-SADS focuses on mania and is a combination/modification of Geller's WASH-U-KSADS and the 4th revision of the KSADS-P (by Joaquim Puig-Antich and Neal Ryan) Specifically, it assess 21 symptoms related to mania, hypomania, and rapid cycling. Each item is rated on a 0-6 rating <b>scale.</b> <b>Scores</b> of 0 suggest no information is available; scores of 1 suggest the symptom is not present at all; scores of 2 suggest the symptom is slightly present; scores of 3 suggest the symptom is mildly severe; scores of 4 suggest the symptom is moderately severe; scores of 5 suggest the symptom is severe; and scores of 6 suggest the symptom is extremely severe. Items with scores of 4 or higher are clinically significant/maladaptive. Trained clinicians or clinical researchers administer the assessment to both {{the child and the}} parent, which each provide their own separate score for each item (P and C), and the total score encompasses the sum of all of the items (S).|$|E

2500|$|Beginning {{with the}} test {{administered}} in April 1995, the SAT score scale was recentered {{to return the}} average math and verbal scores close to 500. Although only 25 students had received perfect scores of 1600 in all of 1994, 137 students taking the April test scored a 1600. The new scale used a reference group of about one million seniors {{in the class of}} 1990: the scale was designed so that the SAT scores of this cohort would have a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 110. Because the new scale would not be directly comparable to the old <b>scale,</b> <b>scores</b> awarded on April 1995 and later were officially reported with an [...] "R" [...] (for example, [...] "560R") to reflect the change in scale, a practice that was continued until 2001. Scores awarded before April 1995 may be compared to those on the recentered scale by using official College Board tables. For example, verbal and math scores of 500 received before 1995 correspond to scores of 580 and 520, respectively, on the 1995 scale.|$|E

40|$|Research has {{established}} an indirect influence between school principals and student achievement on standardized tests. This paper considers {{how to measure}} the relationships between teacher and principal perceptions of four dimensions of principal leadership in New Mexico’s K- 12 schools—setting a shared vision, developing a culture of learning, managing resources, and collaborating with the community—and student <b>scaled</b> <b>score</b> growth over four years on New Mexico’s standards-based assessments. Using two valid, reliable survey instruments, data was electronically collected from 437 teachers and 41 principals; aggregate reading and math <b>scaled</b> <b>scores</b> were also collected for all students in these 41 schools. Based on {{one-way analysis of variance}} (ANOVA) and estimates of Cronbach’s alpha, in this application, both instruments used to survey teachers and principals were confirmed as valid and reliable. Additionally, the two instruments appeared to provide similar information from principals and teachers, as three pairs of teacher and principal variables had statistically significant correlations. Two statistically significant relationships were identified relevant to the potential use of <b>scaled</b> <b>score</b> growth to measure school, principal, and teacher performance. First, schools with lower <b>scaled</b> <b>scores</b> in 2008 averaged more growth than schools with higher schools. Second, <b>scaled</b> <b>score</b> growth appeared to have a leveling effect, as no statistically significant correlations were observed between <b>scaled</b> <b>score</b> growth and student or school demographic variables such as percentage of English learners, student ethnicity, percentage of students with disabilities, or percentage of students qualifying for free or reduced price lunches.
