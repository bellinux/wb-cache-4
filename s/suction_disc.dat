5|$|The caterpillar-like larvae have hard sclerotinised {{heads with}} mandibles (jaws), short true legs on the thorax, prolegs {{on the first}} eight {{abdominal}} segments, and a <b>suction</b> <b>disc</b> or pair of hooks on the terminal tenth segment. The pupae have free appendages rather than being secured within a cocoon (they are exarate).|$|E
500|$|The female {{lays the}} eggs {{in close contact}} with moisture, and the eggs {{typically}} absorb water and increase in size after deposition. In species that live in hot conditions, the eggs may not hatch for several months, the larvae only emerging when the dry season has finished. More typically, however, they hatch after {{a relatively short period of}} time. The larvae are usually quite caterpillar-like, with short, clawed, true legs, and a number of abdominal prolegs. They have sclerotised heads with mandibulate mouthparts. Larvae possess compound eyes, which is unique among holometabolous insects. The tenth abdominal segment bears either a <b>suction</b> <b>disc,</b> or, less commonly, a pair of hooks. They generally eat vegetation or scavenge for dead insects, although some predatory larvae are known. [...] The larva crawls into the soil or decaying wood to pupate, and does not spin a cocoon. The pupae are exarate, meaning the limbs are free of the body, and are able to move their mandibles, but are otherwise entirely nonmotile. In drier environments, they may spend several months in diapause, before emerging as adults once the conditions are more suitable.|$|E

50|$|Both {{male and}} female Amolops hongkongensis grow to a snout-vent length of 40 mm. Tadpoles are up to 25 mm in length. The {{diameter}} of its <b>suction</b> <b>discs</b> is 3-4 times {{the width of the}} fingers. It contains the tarsal fold and has white velvety nuptial pads on the first fingers.|$|R
5000|$|The Sicydiinae {{are a small}} {{subfamily}} (about 118 species) {{of freshwater}} gobies, with only nine genera. They are usually found in fast-moving mountain streams in tropical islands. They are characterized by highly developed rounded <b>suction</b> <b>discs</b> and an amphidromous lifecycle. Adult lengths range from 2 to 15 cm. Some species are popular in the aquarium trade. The genera included under Sicydiinae are: ...|$|R
50|$|The female S. lagocephalus lays its eggs {{in fresh}} water. After hatching, the larvae {{repeatedly}} rise towards {{the surface of}} the stream and then sink down again; this helps them to get carried along by the current. They consume their yolk sacs and will die if they do not reach the sea within about seven days. On arrival in the marine environment they are between 1 and 4 mm long, and start to feed on plankton. They are translucent at this stage and remain at sea for somewhere between 133 and 256 days before getting the urge to migrate back into fresh water. The post-larval stage starts as they enter estuaries. They have already developed <b>suction</b> <b>discs,</b> but now they undergo metamorphosis, their mouths move from the tip of the snout to the underneath of the head, they begin to develop pigment, the pectoral fins transform, the tail loses its fork, they grow teeth on the premaxillae bone, changes occur in the cranium and changes in osmoregulation take place. As the rake-like teeth push through, they start to feed on diatoms and algae that they scrape off the substrate. After two days in the estuary, the juvenile fish move upstream, overcoming small waterfalls with the aid of their <b>suction</b> <b>discs,</b> and after about three or four weeks of migration start to take up territories in the fast-flowing streams where they will breed.|$|R
50|$|Usually lives among oyster reefs, but {{may also}} be found within {{eelgrass}} beds. Stays in shallow waters near the shore during warmer months but will move to deeper waters in winter. Almost always clings to rocks or shells with <b>suction</b> <b>disc.</b>|$|E
50|$|Careproctus is a genus of snailfishes {{found in}} benthic and benthopelagic {{habitats}} in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. They range from shallow coastal waters to depths below 7000 m. These species have {{one pair of}} nostrils and a ventral <b>suction</b> <b>disc</b> but lack a pseudobranch.|$|E
50|$|The caterpillar-like larvae have hard sclerotinised {{heads with}} mandibles (jaws), short true legs on the thorax, prolegs {{on the first}} eight {{abdominal}} segments, and a <b>suction</b> <b>disc</b> or pair of hooks on the terminal tenth segment. The pupae have free appendages rather than being secured within a cocoon (they are exarate).|$|E
50|$|Sicyases sanguineus {{attaches}} {{by means}} of a large disc formed of the fused and highly modified pelvic fins, bearing small and flattened dermal papillae. The combination of <b>suction</b> by <b>disc</b> and adhesion by papillae secure the clingfish to the rock.|$|R
50|$|Males {{typically}} reach 30 - 40 cm {{in length}} and the larger females rarely surpass 50 cm {{in length and}} 5 kg in weight. The maximum is 61 cm in length and 9.5 kg in weight. In the brackish water of the Baltic Sea it usually does not surpass 20 cm. The body is ball-like. It has a knobbly, ridged back and three large bony tubercles on each flank. Its pelvic fins form <b>suction</b> <b>discs</b> which it uses to attach strongly to rocks or other surfaces. The head and the pectoral fins of males are larger than those of females. It has a jelly-like layer of fat under the skin which makes it appear to quiver when held in the hand. Its colour is highly variable; bluish, greyish, olive, yellowish or brownish. Mature males, which turn orange-reddish during the breeding season, are brighter than females.|$|R
40|$|The ray-finned fish family Gobiesocidae {{includes}} over 100 {{species of}} fish that {{are commonly known as}} clingfish (Fishbase). These aptly named clingfish posses modified pelvic fins that are fused into a biological suction cup, allowing the fish to adhere to surfaces in their environments. The northern clingfish, Gobiesox maeandricus, is a common inhabitant of the rocky intertidal shores along the Pacific Northwest coast of North America. The northern clingfish can reach sizes up to 16 cm but are much more common around 8 - 10 cm (Fishbase). These clingfish use their <b>suction</b> <b>discs</b> to adhere to rocks in their intertidal home, providing a way to remain stationary and stable in the turbulent waters close to shore. Although intertidal rocks differ greatly in surface roughness, we have observed that the northern clingfish {{does not appear to be}} limited to only smooth rocks. While manufactured suction cups function only on smooth surfaces, clingfish appear able to stick on the myriad types of surfaces present in the intertidal. This study seeks to compare how well clingfish are able to adhere to surfaces of different roughness...|$|R
50|$|Breeding {{might occur}} {{throughout}} the year. The tadpoles grow to about 6 mm in body length and 14 mm in total length. The tadpole is dorso-ventrally flattened {{and has a}} large ventral <b>suction</b> <b>disc</b> behind its mouth. It is similar to other Atelopus tadpoles except that its upper beak is shorter than the lower one.|$|E
50|$|Liparis fabricii {{grows to}} {{a length of}} 18 to 20 cm. The shape of its body resembles that of a tadpole, with a large rounded head and abdomen {{tapering}} towards a narrow tail. Two nasal pores are present {{on each side of}} the head. The eyes are relatively large, with orbital diameters of 5.3 to 10.3% of the total body length. The mouth is shaped into a <b>suction</b> <b>disc</b> and has simple unlobed teeth. The peritoneum of L. fabricii is distinctively dark, visible in both the interior of the mouth and behind the gill covers.|$|E
50|$|The {{pectoral}} fins {{are large}} {{with the tip}} reaching the anal fin. The pelvic fins located just below the pectorals are modified into a <b>suction</b> <b>disc.</b> Both the anal and the single dorsal fin are very large, arising from around {{the middle of the}} body to where they overlap the small rounded caudal fin. The number of soft rays on the anal fin ranges from 37 to 42, distinguishing them from other species of snailfish which usually only have 36. The dorsal fin has 45 to 50 rays.|$|E
30|$|In Study 2, oospores {{were applied}} {{embedded}} in nylon net filter discs (diameter 47  mm, 20  μm mesh, Millipore™; Table  1; Etxeberria et al. [2011]). Aliquots (5  mL per disc) of each suspension were filtered through each mesh under <b>suction.</b> Three <b>discs</b> of one species were stapled to each segment. On one segment of each treatment discs were placed with the upper surface (as positioned during vacuum filtration) upwards {{and on a}} second segment the disc was fastened inverted. Numbers of oospores embedded on each nylon disc filter were estimated as previously at between 1, 000 and 4, 000  cm- 2.|$|R
40|$|A {{cryogenic}} gyroscope housing having gas spin-up means {{provided in}} annular discs inserted between housing shells is described. A circumferential recess {{in the inner}} edges of the discs at their juncture serves as the gas spin-up channel, and recesses in the discs at their junctures with the shells form <b>suction</b> channels. The <b>discs</b> also have inlet and outlet ports communicating with the spin-up channel and exhaust slots communicating with the suction channels. Mating surfaces of the discs and housing shells are held in position by optical contact at the equational plane of the housing. Suspension electrodes and thin-film readout loops are disposed in shells. A centering band and clamp rings provide for proper alinement and placement of parts in formation of optical contact joints...|$|R
50|$|The skilletfish has {{a frying}} pan-shaped body which can grow to about 3 inches in length. The body is {{compressed}} dorsoventrally {{with the head}} being wider than the body. Tiny eyes are located {{on top of the}} head. The fish also has strong teeth and fleshy lips. Color varies from a pale gray to dark brown with a mottled pattern. About 6 faint lines radiate from eye. The fish also has a dark band at the base of its rounded tail fin. Modified pelvic fins form a large <b>suction</b> <b>disc</b> {{on the underside of the}} body. The dorsal and ventral fins are set fairly far back on the body.|$|E
50|$|Compared {{to other}} species of remora, Remora osteochir is sturdy with a small mouth, stiff, rounded {{pectoral}} fins and wide-base pelvic fins. It can grow to a maximum length of about 40 cm. As {{is the case with}} other remoras, the front dorsal fin {{has been replaced by a}} <b>suction</b> <b>disc,</b> the length of which is 37 to 49% of the standard length of the fish. The disc has 15 to 19 laminae. Both the dorsal and anal fins are relatively short; the dorsal fin has 20 to 26 soft rays, the anal fin has 20 to 25 and the pectoral fins have 20 to 24 soft rays. The dorsal colouring is dark grey to black and the ventral surface is rather paler. Apart from the tips of the outer rays of the caudal fin, which are grey, the fins are black in adults, but transparent or pale grey in juveniles.|$|E
50|$|Several {{aspects of}} their biology (i.e. lack of a swimbladder, its pelvic <b>suction</b> <b>disc)</b> led some {{to believe that they}} were a bottom {{dwelling}} species. Lumpfish are frequently caught in pelagic fishing nets, however, capture in bottom trawls is also common. An investigation using electronic data-storage tags attached to the fish have confirmed that, at least during its breeding migration, this fish will spend time associated with the sea bed, and also some time in the pelagic zone. As the fish came close to breeding, they began to spend a greater amount of time in the pelagic zone. With the lack of a swim bladder, the fish were able to make rapid movements through the water column, moving between surface waters and depths of over 300 m within one day. Data from research surveys and data-storage tags show that adult lumpfish alter their behaviour between night and day with the fish spending more time in the pelagic zone at night and found associated with the seabed during the day, the reasons for this are unclear. This fish is now considered to be a semi-pelagic/semi-demersal fish.|$|E

40|$|The paired fins of the basic, ancestral type of free-swimming acanthopterygian teleost serve {{primarily}} in guiding the forward course {{of movement and}} in maneuvering within the water column. In various scorpaeniform fishes the paired fins have taken {{on a number of}} other functions associated with a bottom-living mode of life. Among these are: defense against predation, probing for food items, propping the forward part of the body away from the bottom, progressing over it, digging into it, {{and the development of a}} <b>suction</b> <b>disc</b> for attachment to it. The relationship between these developments and paired-fin structure is the subject of the paper...|$|E
