25|$|The {{vasodilatation}} {{caused by}} <b>sodium</b> <b>nitroprusside</b> {{has been shown}} to be mediated not only by NO generation, but also by endogenous cyanide generation, which adds not only toxicity, but also some additional antihypertensive efficacy compared to nitroglycerine and other non-cyanogenic nitrates which do not cause blood cyanide levels to rise.|$|E
25|$|The cyanide {{compound}} <b>sodium</b> <b>nitroprusside</b> is used {{mainly in}} clinical chemistry to measure urine ketone bodies mainly as {{a follow-up to}} diabetic patients. On occasion, it is used in emergency medical situations to produce a rapid decrease in blood pressure in humans; it is also used as a vasodilator in vascular research. The cobalt in artificial vitamin B12 contains a cyanide ligand as an artifact of the purification process; this must be removed by the body before the vitamin molecule can be activated for biochemical use. During World War I, a copper cyanide compound was briefly used by Japanese physicians {{for the treatment of}} tuberculosis and leprosy.|$|E
25|$|Creatinine {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in vitro by Ivan Horbaczewski in 1885. One year later, Jaffe's research {{was published in}} the paper Über den Niederschlag, welchen Pikrinsäre in normalem Harn erzeugt und über eine neue Reaction des Kreatinins. Jaffe had noticed that, when mixed in a sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution, picric acid and creatinine formed a reddish-orange color and needle-like crystal precipitate. By using zinc chloride in a process known as the Neubauer reaction, and then performing the Weyl's test, a colorimetric reaction using <b>sodium</b> <b>nitroprusside</b> (SNP), he determined that the precipitated compound was a double salt of the solution. Although he found the amount of precipitate directly proportional to the creatinine concentration, he also noted that the reaction was highly nonspecific and could be observed with many other organic compounds.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>nitroprusside</b> is {{also able}} to detect amines. This {{compound}} is thus used as a stain to indicate amines in thin layer chromatography. <b>Sodium</b> <b>nitroprusside</b> is similarly used as a presumptive test {{for the presence of}} alkaloids (amine-containing natural products) common in illicit substances. [...] The test, called Simon's test, is performed by adding 1 volume of a solution of <b>sodium</b> <b>nitroprusside</b> and acetaldehyde in deionized water to a suspected drug, followed by the addition of 2 volumes of an aqueous sodium carbonate solution. The test turns blue for some secondary amines. The most common secondary amines encountered in forensic chemistry include 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, the main component in Ecstasy) and phenethylamines such as methamphetamine. <b>Sodium</b> <b>nitroprusside</b> is also useful in the identification the mercaptans (thiol groups) in the nitroprusside reaction.|$|E
50|$|The reagent is {{composed}} of a mixture of <b>sodium</b> <b>nitroprusside,</b> sodium carbonate and acetaldehyde, which is dripped onto the substance being tested. The amine and acetaldehyde produce the enamine, which subsequently reacts with <b>sodium</b> <b>nitroprusside</b> to the imine. Finally, the immonium salt is hydrolysed to the bright cobalt-blue Simon-Awe complex.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>nitroprusside</b> is {{also used}} as an {{analytical}} reagent under the name sodium nitroferricyanide {{for the detection of}} methyl ketones, and for the detection of amines that are often found in illicit drugs. <b>Sodium</b> <b>nitroprusside</b> was found by Legal to give a reaction with acetone or creatine under basic conditions in 1882. Rothera refined this method by the use of ammonia in place of sodium or potassium hydroxide. The reaction was now specific for methyl ketones. Addition of ammonium salts (e.g. ammonium sulfate) improved the sensitivity of the test, too.|$|E

50|$|Several {{classes of}} {{antihypertensive}} agents are recommended, {{with the choice}} depending on the etiology of the hypertensive crisis, {{the severity of the}} elevation in blood pressure, and the usual blood pressure of the patient before the hypertensive crisis. In most cases, the administration of an intravenous <b>sodium</b> <b>nitroprusside</b> injection, which has an almost immediate antihypertensive effect, is suitable (but in many cases not readily available). In less urgent cases, oral agents like captopril, clonidine, labetalol, or prazosin can be used, but all have a delayed onset of action (by several minutes) compared to <b>sodium</b> <b>nitroprusside.</b> Controlled bloodletting is an effective salvage therapy in the interim when nitroprusside is unavailable, and aggressive oral therapy has not yet taken effect.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>nitroprusside</b> {{should not}} be used for {{compensatory}} hypertension (e.g. due to an anteriovenous stent or coarctation of the aorta). It {{should not be}} used in patients with inadequate cerebral circulation or in patients who are near death. It {{should not be used}} in patients with vitamin B12 deficiency, anaemia, severe renal disease, or hypovolaemia. Patients with conditions associated with a higher cyanide/thiocyanate ratio (e.g. congenital (Leber's) optic atrophy, tobacco amblyopia) should only be treated with <b>sodium</b> <b>nitroprusside</b> with great caution. Its use in patients with acute congestive heart failure associated with reduced peripheral resistance is also not recommended. Its use in hepatically impaired individuals is also not recommended, as is its use in cases of pre-existing hypothyroidism.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>nitroprusside</b> has potent vasodilating {{effects in}} arterioles and venules (arterioles more than venules, but this {{selectivity}} {{is much less}} marked than that of nitroglycerin, which acts preferentially at venous smooth muscle) {{as a result of}} its breakdown to nitric oxide (NO).|$|E

50|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>nitroprusside</b> {{is used in}} a {{separate}} urinalysis test known as the cyanide nitroprusside test or Brand's test. In this test, sodium cyanide is added first to urine and let stand for about 10 minutes. In this time, disulfide bonds will be broken by the released cyanide. The destruction of disulfide bonds liberates cysteine from cystine as well as homocysteine from homocystine. Next, <b>sodium</b> <b>nitroprusside</b> {{is added to the}} solution and it reacts with the newly freed sulfhydryl groups. The test will turn a red/purple colour if the test is positive, indicating significant amounts of amino acids were in the urine (aminoaciduria). Cysteine, cystine, homocysteine, and homocystine all react when present in the urine when this test is performed. This test can indicate inborn errors of amino acid transporters such as cystinuria, which results from pathology in the transport of dibasic amino acids.|$|E
