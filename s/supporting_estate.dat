The first part is devoted to the mathematical fundamentals of recognition procedures. The main part serves the survey of low-level object features in relation to our CBIR system, which is dedicated to <b>supporting</b> <b>estate</b> agents. In the database there are images of houses and bungalows. Hence, the dissimilarity measures are scrutinized with reference to architectural object features. We present a brief overview of (dis) similarity measures for various types of object features, together with their characteristics. At the middle-level image analyses based on spatial relations must also employ comparisons to evaluate the object spatial localization. At this level the spatial similarity gives crucial information to respond to the query concerning the best matching of whole images. With the aim of modelling dissimilarity judgments some tree structures are introduced. Therefore, the approach to the dissimilarity in this CBIR system is hybrid. The basic experimental research concentrates on examining dissimilarities among house images...|$|E
5000|$|The Court of Appeals {{found that}} there was not a taking and affirmed the holding of the District Court. It also found that Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon did not apply. The Court of Appeals took a {{different}} approach to analyzing the <b>support</b> <b>estate</b> than the District Court did and [...] "Considered the <b>support</b> <b>estate</b> as just one segment of a larger bundle of rights that invariably includes either the surface estate or the mineral estate." [...] So, instead of finding that there were three separate estates in land, the Court of Appeals decided that the <b>support</b> <b>estate</b> was not a separate estate in land. Instead, the <b>support</b> <b>estate</b> was to be included as part of the surface estate or the mineral estate. By combining the <b>support</b> <b>estate</b> with the surface estate or the mineral estate, the petitioners' [...] "bundle of rights" [...] became larger. Therefore, the Court of Appeals found that [...] "'their entire 'bundle' of property rights had not been destroyed.'" [...] In addition, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's holding concerning the Contracts Clause claim.|$|R
5000|$|The District Court {{held that}} Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon {{did not apply}} {{and that there was}} not a taking. Finding [...] "that the Subsidence Act served valid public purposes," [...] the District Court {{determined}} that the Act was a legitimate exercise of the state's police power. In response to the petitioners' <b>support</b> <b>estate</b> argument, the District Court found that [...] "The <b>support</b> <b>estate</b> consists of a bundle of rights, including some that were not affected by the Act." [...] In essence, the District Court recognized that the <b>support</b> <b>estate</b> was a separate estate in land, but that the Act did not effect a taking of the whole <b>support</b> <b>estate</b> involved in this case. The District Court also rejected the Contracts Clause claim because the petitioners did not present evidence that the Act [...] "had impaired any contract to which the Commonwealth was a party." ...|$|R
5000|$|Both {{lower courts}} cited Andrus v. Allard (1979), a Supreme Court case {{describing}} the [...] "bundle of rights" [...] that a property owner possesses. Relying on Andrus, both courts {{found that the}} <b>support</b> <b>estate</b> was just a [...] "'strand'" [...] in a larger bundle of rights. According to these courts, the Act had to effect a taking of the combined bundle of the surface <b>estate,</b> <b>support</b> <b>estate,</b> and mineral estate to be deemed a taking.|$|R
5000|$|The Court {{denied the}} petitioners' {{argument}} that their <b>support</b> <b>estate</b> had been taken. It analogized the <b>support</b> <b>estate</b> {{in this case}} to the [...] "air rights" [...] above Grand Central Station in Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City (1978) {{and found that it}} was not [...] "a separate segment of property for Takings Clause purposes." [...] Declining to allow state law definitions of property interests to govern its takings analysis, the Court viewed Pennsylvania's three estates in land as one combined property interest.|$|R

One target of this legislation was the federal estate tax. Prior to passage of the 2001 bills, the tax applied to inheritances of more than $ 1 million at a rate of up to 56 %. The new legislation reduces the rate to 45 % and increases the application threshold to $ 3. 5 million by 2009. In 2010, the federal estate tax disappears altogether. But the law also has...|$|R

5000|$|Finally, Rehnquist argued it was {{incorrect}} {{for the majority}} to overlook Pennsylvania's three defined property interests. He disagreed with the majority's view that the 27 million tons of coal that couldn't be mined {{as a result of}} the Subsidence Act wasn't a separate property interest. Rehnquist pointed out that Pennsylvania divides property interests into three categories. These categories are [...] "the <b>support</b> <b>estate,</b> the surface estate, and the mineral estate." [...] Each interest is deemed separate from the other and may have separate owners in fee simple. For example, under Pennsylvania law, one person could own the surface estate, a second person could own the <b>support</b> <b>estate,</b> and a third person could own the mineral estate. If one owner purchased a mineral estate to mine and couldn't after the Subsidence Act was passed, then it reduced the value of that estate. Instead of considering the three separate estates in land, Rehnquist believed that the majority only considered a [...] "broader, yet undefined, segment of property." [...] Looking at this broader property interest led the majority to hold that there was no taking of the whole estate (the three separate estates combined). Rehnquist did not agree with the majority's analysis on this issue and would have found a taking.|$|R

5000|$|The petitioners' main {{contention}} {{was that}} one restriction imposed by the DER is that [...] "50% of the coal beneath structures protected by § 4" [...] must be left unearthed to support the surface land, and that consequently their [...] "support estates had been entirely destroyed" [...] {{because they had to}} leave 50% of the coal beneath the surface in place, so they could only mine the mineral estate while leaving the <b>support</b> <b>estate</b> untouched. In answers to interrogatories, the petitioners claimed that from 1966 to 1982 their land use rights at their 13 coal mines had been restricted to the point of a taking because of the Subsidence Act. As a result, they claimed that they had to leave about 27 million tons of coal in place. Altogether, these mines contained at least 1.46 billion tons of coal. The percentage of coal that had to remain unmined was less than 2% of the petitioners' total coal.|$|R
