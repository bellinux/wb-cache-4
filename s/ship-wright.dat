6000|$|The Sea Lion {{was found}} to perform well. She had been {{constructed}} {{with an eye to}} comfort, as well as to sailing, and possessed that just proportion in her hull which carried her over the surface of the waves like a duck. This quality is of more importance to a small than to a large vessel, for the want of momentum renders what is termed [...] "burying" [...] a very deadening process to a light craft. In this very important particular Roswell was soon satisfied that the <b>ship-wright</b> had done his duty.|$|E
5000|$|Elladan {{includes}} the element adan, the singular of Edain (the fathers of Men {{who became the}} Númenóreans). [...] "Adan", strictly speaking, is [...] "man", but in usage, it means Númenórean, advanced man, wise man, as in Dúnedain. There is also overlap with the word [...] "dan" [...] meaning [...] "wright or smith". (Examples of this are Círdan name, <b>ship-wright</b> and Mírdain name, jewel-smiths). So the highest, most knowing sort of man is what is implied here - a man of lore and craft, significant ideas in the Tolkien universe.|$|E

And round the square worked the <b>ship-wrights,</b> as many in number as ants, twining ropes, and hewing timber, and smoothing long yards and oars. And the Minuai went on in silence through clean white marble streets, till {{they came to the}} hall of Alcinous, and they wondered then still more. For the lofty palace shone aloft in the sun, with walls of plated brass, from the threshold to the innermost chamber, and the doors were of silver and gold. And {{on each side of the}} doorway sat living dogs of gold, who never grew old or died, so well Hephaistos had made them in his forges in smoking Lemnos, and gave them to Alcinous to guard his gates by night. And within, against the walls, stood thrones on either side, down the whole length of the hall, strewn with rich glossy shawls; and on them the merchant kings of those crafty sea-roving Phæaces sat eating and drinking in pride, and feasting there all the year round. And boys of molten gold stood each on a polished altar, and held torches in their hands, to give light all night to the guests. And round the house sat fifty maid-servants, some grinding the meal in the mill, some turning the spindle, some weaving at the loom, while their hands twinkled as they passed the shuttle, like quivering aspen leaves.|$|R
