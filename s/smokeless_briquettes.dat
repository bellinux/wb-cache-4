40|$|In Krakow, Poland, {{coal-fired}} boilers {{are used}} to heat single apartment buildings and local heating districts. Tile population includes 2, 930 small, hand-fired boilers and 227 larger traveling grate stoker-fired boilers. These boilers are important contributors to air quality problems in Krakow, and an assessment of their efficiency and emissions characteristics was recently undertaken. For the larger, stoker-fired boilers, efficiency was measured using a stack-loss method In addition to the normal baseline fuel, the effects of coal cleaning and grading were evaluated Testing was done at two selected sites. Boiler efficiencies {{were found to be}} low- 50 % to 67 %. These boilers operate without combustion controls or instrumentation for flue gas analysis. As a result, excess air levels are very high (up to 400 %) leading to poor performance. Emissions were found to be typical for boilers of this type. Using the improved fuels yields reductions in emissions and improvement in efficiency when combined with proper adjustments. In the case of the hand-fired boilers, one set of cast-iron boilers and one set of steel boilers were tested. Efficiency in this case was measured using an input-output method for sets of three boilers taken together as a system. Emissions from these boilers are lowest when low volatile fuels, such as coke or <b>smokeless</b> <b>briquettes,</b> are used...|$|E
50|$|The {{coke ovens}} and {{by-product}} plant were opened in 1951, {{as part of}} the NCB's modernisation of the regional and national coal industry. The plant produced both furnace and foundry coke for the steel industry. Both for the Welsh industry (then Ebbw Vale, Llanwern and Port Talbot and abroad, including Romania. The branded Phurnacite <b>smokeless</b> coal <b>briquettes</b> for the domestic market, produced in the Phurnacite works (Abercwmboi in the Cynon Valley) was also stored at Nantgarw awaiting sale.|$|R
