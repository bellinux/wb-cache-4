The remaining 4% belong to other religions, such as Buddhism, and Judaism. [...] While there was an overall increase in the number of religious adherents over the decade of 103,000, that did not keep pace with the overall population increase in the country during the same period, which increased by almost three-quarters of million individuals, resulting in the percentage drop.

2500|$|In 2005, {{a series}} of climate {{modeling}} studies performed at NOAA / Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory indicated that the late 20th century Sahel drought was probably a climatic response to changing sea surface temperature patterns, {{and that it could}} be viewed as a combination of natural variability superimposed upon an anthropogenically forced regional drying trend. Using GFDL CM2.X, these climate model simulations indicated that the general late 20th century Sahel drying trend was attributable to human-induced factors; largely due to an increase in greenhouse gases and partly due to an increase in atmospheric aerosols. A study published in 2013, done at the University of Washington, suggests that atmospheric aerosols caused a downward shift in the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The shift, the <b>study</b> <b>says,</b> left normally rainy areas in Central Africa much drier.

2500|$|Horowitz taught seven {{students}} between 1937 and 1962: Nico Kaufmann (1937), Byron Janis (1944–1948), Gary Graffman (1953–1955), Coleman Blumfield (1956–1958), Ronald Turini (1957–1963), Alexander Fiorillo (1960–1962) and Ivan Davis (1961–1962). Janis {{described his}} relationship to Horowitz during that period as a surrogate son, and he often traveled with Horowitz and his wife during concert tours. Davis was invited {{to become one of}} Horowitz's students after receiving a call from him the day after he won the Franz Liszt Competition. At the time, Davis had a contract with Columbia Records and a national tour planned. Horowitz claimed that he had only taught three students during that period. [...] "Many young people say they have been pupils of Horowitz, but there were only three. Janis, Turini, who I brought to the stage, and Graffman. If someone else claims it, it's not true. I had some who played for me for four months. Once a week. I stopped work with them, because they did not progress." [...] According to biographer Glenn Plaskin, [...] "The fact that Horowitz disavowed most of his students and blurred the facts regarding their periods of <b>study</b> <b>says</b> something about the erratic nature of his personality during that period". Horowitz returned to coaching in the 1980s, working with Murray Perahia, who already had an established career, and Eduardus Halim.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{frequently}} occurring Y-DNA haplogroup among modern Filipinos is Haplogroup O3-M122, which is found with high frequency in populations from East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Polynesia. In particular, {{the type of}} O3-M122 that is found frequently in Filipinos, O-P201(xM7, M134), is also found frequently in other Austronesian populations, especially the Batak Toba from Sumatra and the Polynesians. Haplogroup O1a-M119 (labeled as [...] "Haplogroup H" [...] in this study) is also commonly found among Filipinos and is shared with other Austronesian-speaking populations, especially those in Taiwan, western Indonesia, and Madagascar. After the 16th century, the colonial period saw the influx of genetic influence from other populations. This {{is evidenced by the}} presence of the Y-DNA Haplogroup R1b which is present among the population of the Philippines. However, DNA studies vary. A year 2001 study conducted by Stanford University Asia-Pacific Research Center stated that 3.6% of the Philippine population had European Y-DNA. However, only 28 individuals from the isolated rural island of Palawan were genotyped for this study, a sample size far below the minimum sample size needed to account for credible test results in a population of over 100 million individuals. According to another genetic study done by the University of California (San Francisco), they discovered that Filipinos possess moderate amounts of European genetic ancestry. Also, according to a massive DNA study conducted by the National Geographic's, [...] "The Genographic Project", based on genetic testings of 80,000 Filipino people by the National Geographic in 2008–2009, they found out that the average Filipino's genes are around 53% Southeast Asian and had varying Oceanian, East Asian, Southern European, South Asian and Native American percentages. Most of these statistical samples however came from Mindanao and Palawan; areas that were least affected by Spanish colonization. Which means that people coming from North and some Visayan cities that are traditionally hispanic outpost might have more. The Stanford <b>study</b> <b>says</b> that 3.6% (that is 1 out of 28) have shown to have European PATERNAL markers. That is, the Y chromosome passed by the males to their male offsprings/descendants (aka unbroken male lineage). The European ancestry was actually more of a side note as the study was geared towards [...] "interbreeding" [...] between Homo erectus and homo sapiens. The Kaiser (UCSF) study was more generalized. It says that [...] "self-reported Filipinos showed continuous European genetic ancestry". Points to consider: Stanford only studied Y chromosomes. Kaiser most likely used the newer autosomal DNA testing.|$|E

6000|$|... [1] Mr. Quam's words (Medical Times and Gazette, February 20) are:--"A {{few words}} as to our special Medical course of {{instruction}} {{and the influence}} upon it of such changes in the elementary schools as I have mentioned. The student now enters at once upon several sciences--physics, chemistry, anatomy, physiology, botany, pharmacy, therapeutics--all these, {{the facts and the}} language and the laws of each, to be mastered in eighteen months. Up {{to the beginning of the}} Medical course many have learned little. We cannot claim anything better than the Examiner of the University of London and the Cambridge Lecturer have reported for their Universities. Supposing that at school young people had acquired some exact elementary knowledge in physics, chemistry, and a branch of natural history--say botany--with the physiology connected with it, they would then have gained necessary knowledge, with some practice in inductive reasoning. The whole studies are processes of observation and induction--the best discipline of the mind for the purposes of life--for our purposes not less than any. 'By such <b>study</b> (<b>says</b> Dr. Whewell) of one or more departments of inductive science the mind may escape from the thraldom of mere words.' By that plan the burden of the early Medical course would be much lightened, and more time devoted to practical studies, including Sir Thomas Watson's 'final and supreme stage' of the knowledge of Medicine." ...|$|E
