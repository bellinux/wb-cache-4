40|$|Group loans with joint {{liability}} {{have been a}} distinguishing feature of many microfinance programs. While such lending has benefitted millions of borrowers, major lending institutions have acknowledged their limited impact among the very poor and have recently favored individual contracts. This paper attempts to understand these empirical patterns using a model {{in which there is}} a <b>single</b> <b>investment</b> <b>project</b> and access to credit is limited by weak repayment incentives. We show that in the absence of large social sanctions, the poorest borrowers are offered individual and not group contracts. When both types of contracts are feasible, the relative gains from group loans are shown to be decreasing in loan size. We compare the role of bank enforcement with social sanctions and find that bank enforcement is more effective in increasing outreach while social sanctions raise the welfare of infra-marginal borrowers. Finally, we explore the welfare effects of group size and find that those requiring small loans are better served by larger groups but group size effects are, in general, ambiguous. group lending; joint-liability; microcredit; repayment incentives; social sanctions. ...|$|E

40|$|Merged with {{duplicate}} record 10026. 1 / 781 on 27. 03. 2017 by CS (TIS) Using large-company panel data, this thesis empirically analyses investment decisions in major European countries. We particularly concentrate on three issues: the taxation of {{capital in the}} EU, the role of agency costs of debt on investment decisions, and the empirical analyses of the investment-uncertainty relationship. First, based on a dynamic system in capital and Tobin's q ratio, some simplified analytical results are derived to simulate various tax policy effects on investment. Also, for a <b>single</b> <b>investment</b> <b>project,</b> a model is developed to consider jointly the role of uncertainty and irreversibility in the taxation of capital. The simulation results {{cast doubt on the}} tax competition view for the domestic investment case. Second, using a Euler equation approach, an investment equation is derived to test the possible effects of agency/financial distress costs of debt on investment for UK, German and French firms. The results reveal that the agency/financial distress cost of debt does matter for the highly leveraged firms. Further, an alternative model is derived in a q theory framework to test this negative effect. The model is tested for the UK firms, and similar results are obtained. Third, by considering the product structure of firms, the firm-level investment-uncertainty relationship is tested for UK firms. Unlike previous empirical findings, the results support the two opposing views in this field. Additionally, using vector autoregression analysis, a statistical account of the aggregate investment-uncertainty relation is given for the UK. An important observation is that although the exchange rate uncertainty has negative effects on machinery and equipment investment, it has no effect on construction investment...|$|E

40|$|A {{large number}} of economic, financial, social, technological, {{ecological}} – environmental and other indicators define {{the effectiveness of the}} <b>investment</b> <b>projects.</b> According to some of the indicators, the alternative <b>investment</b> <b>project</b> is suitable for putting it into practice, according to others, it is not. Therefore, while evaluating the <b>investment</b> <b>projects</b> (e. g. the projects which are financed by EU structural funds) it becomes difficult to choose the most effective projects whose realization would bring the most significant benefit to the economy subject and to our country. It is possible to get objective answers about the effectiveness of the alternative <b>investment</b> <b>projects</b> by evaluating them according to multicriterial methods. With the help of such methods it is possible to evaluate the <b>investment</b> <b>projects</b> comprehensively by presenting one generalized indicator. It shows the effectiveness of the alternative project fairly objectively. The multicriterial evaluation method analyzed in the article gave the possibility {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the projects chosen, and to set the priority level of these projects. From the analysis carried out, it is obvious that three <b>investment</b> <b>projects</b> are suitable for being financed and put into practice, and the remaining ones have to be rejected or corrected.
