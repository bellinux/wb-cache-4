5|$|Electric {{potential}} is a <b>scalar</b> <b>quantity,</b> that is, {{it has only}} magnitude and not direction. It {{may be viewed as}} analogous to height: just as a released object will fall through a difference in heights caused by a gravitational field, so a charge will 'fall' across the voltage caused by an electric field. As relief maps show contour lines marking points of equal height, a set of lines marking points of equal potential (known as equipotentials) may be drawn around an electrostatically charged object. The equipotentials cross all lines of force at right angles. They must also lie parallel to a conductor's surface, otherwise this would produce a force that will move the charge carriers to even the potential of the surface.|$|E

25|$|In linear algebra, {{an inner}} product space is a vector space with an {{additional}} structure called an inner product. This additional structure associates each pair of vectors in the space with a <b>scalar</b> <b>quantity</b> known as the inner product of the vectors. Inner products allow the rigorous introduction of intuitive geometrical notions such as {{the length of a}} vector or the angle between two vectors. They also provide the means of defining orthogonality between vectors (zero inner product). Inner product spaces generalize Euclidean spaces (in which the inner product is the dot product, also known as the scalar product) to vector spaces of any (possibly infinite) dimension, and are studied in functional analysis.|$|E
25|$|Since gas {{molecules}} {{can move}} freely within a container, their mass is normally characterized by density. Density {{is the amount}} of mass per unit volume of a substance, or the inverse of specific volume. For gases, the density can vary over a wide range because the particles are free to move closer together when constrained by pressure or volume. This variation of density is referred to as compressibility. Like pressure and temperature, density is a state variable of a gas and the change in density during any process is governed by the laws of thermodynamics. For a static gas, the density is the same throughout the entire container. Density is therefore a <b>scalar</b> <b>quantity.</b> It can be shown by kinetic theory that the density is inversely proportional {{to the size of the}} container in which a fixed mass of gas is confined. In this case of a fixed mass, the density decreases as the volume increases.|$|E
500|$|British scientists, {{including}} Maxwell, had {{relied on}} Hamilton's quaternions {{in order to}} express the dynamics of physical quantities, like the electric and magnetic fields, having both a magnitude and a direction in three-dimensional space. [...] Gibbs, however, noted that the product of quaternions always had to be separated into two parts: a one-dimensional (<b>scalar)</b> <b>quantity</b> and a three-dimensional vector, so {{that the use of}} quaternions introduced mathematical complications and redundancies that could be avoided in the interest of simplicity and to facilitate teaching. [...] He therefore proposed defining distinct dot and cross products for pairs of vectors and introduced the now common notation for them. [...] He was also largely responsible {{for the development of the}} vector calculus techniques still used today in electrodynamics and fluid mechanics.|$|E

Since there were only three students in the department—Fermi, Rasetti, and Nello Carrara—Puccianti let them freely use the laboratory for whatever purposes they chose. Fermi decided that they should research X-ray crystallography, and the three worked to produce a Laue photograph—an X-ray photograph of a crystal. During 1921, his third year at the university, Fermi published his first scientific works in the Italian journal Nuovo Cimento. The first was entitled [...] "On the dynamics of a rigid system of electrical charges in translational motion" [...] (...) [...] A sign of things to come was that the mass was expressed as a tensor—a mathematical construct commonly used to describe something moving and changing in three-dimensional space. In classical mechanics, mass is a <b>scalar</b> <b>quantity,</b> but in relativity it changes with velocity. The second paper was [...] "On the electrostatics of a uniform gravitational field of electromagnetic charges and on the weight of electromagnetic charges" [...] (...) [...] Using general relativity, Fermi showed that a charge has a weight equal to U/c2, where U was the electrostatic energy of the system, and c is the speed of light.|$|E

2500|$|Calculating {{the work}} as [...] "force times {{straight}} path segment" [...] would only apply in the most simple of circumstances, as noted above. If force is changing, or if the body is moving along a curved path, possibly rotating and not necessarily rigid, then only {{the path of the}} application point of the force is relevant for the work done, and only the component of the force parallel to the application point velocity is doing work (positive work when in the same direction, and negative when in the opposite direction of the velocity).

2500|$|In {{science and}} engineering, {{the weight of}} an object is usually taken to be the force on the object due to gravity. Weight is a vector whose {{magnitude}} (a <b>scalar</b> <b>quantity),</b> often denoted by an italic letter W, {{is the product of}} the massm of the object and the magnitude of the local gravitational accelerationg; thus: [...] The unit of measurement for weight is that of force, which in the International System of Units (SI) is the newton. For example, an object with a mass of one kilogram has a weight of about 9.8 newtons {{on the surface of the}} Earth, and about one-sixth as much on the Moon. In this sense of weight, a body can be weightless only if it is distant (in principle infinitely far away) from any other mass. Although weight and mass are scientifically distinct quantities, the terms are often confused with each other in everyday use (i.e. comparing and converting force weight in pounds to mass in kilograms and vice versa).|$|E
