5|$|On June 6, the {{two major}} party campaigns crossed paths in Woodstock, Ontario. Speaking in the afternoon, St. Laurent drew a crowd of 200. To the shock of St. Laurent staffers, who {{remained}} for the Diefenbaker appearance, the PC leader drew an overflow crowd of over a thousand that evening, {{even though he was}} an hour late, with announcements made to the excited crowd that he was slowed by voters who wanted only to see him or <b>shake</b> <b>his</b> hand.|$|E
5|$|Czolgosz {{had lost}} his job during the {{economic}} Panic of 1893 and turned to anarchism, a political philosophy adhered to by recent killers of foreign leaders. Regarding McKinley {{as a symbol of}} oppression, Czolgosz was convinced that it was his duty as an anarchist to kill him. Unable to get near the President during the presidential visit earlier, Czolgosz shot McKinley twice as the President reached to <b>shake</b> <b>his</b> hand in the reception line at the temple. One bullet grazed McKinley; the other entered his abdomen and was never found.|$|E
5|$|Historian Richard Rhodes {{said that}} in his opinion it was already a foregone {{conclusion}} that Oppenheimer would have his security clearance revoked by then AEC chairman Lewis Strauss, regardless of Teller's testimony. However, as Teller's testimony was the most damning, he was singled out and blamed for the hearing's ruling, losing friends due to it, such as Robert Christy, who refused to <b>shake</b> <b>his</b> hand in one infamous incident. This was emblematic of his later treatment which resulted in his being forced {{into the role of}} an outcast of the physics community, thus leaving him little choice but to align himself with industrialists.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the game, feeling insulted, Tregubov {{refused to}} <b>shake</b> <b>his</b> hand. Two days after the game, Tregubov and his team would {{complain}} to arbiters about his suspect strong play, and his frequent toilet breaks. On the second day, Bindrich had the black pieces against Sebastian Siebrecht and on move 10, he took a second toilet break. Siebrecht, having played such cheaters as Christoph Natsidis in the past, suspected that he was using an analysis program on his smartphone. On Bindrich's return an arbiter asked to search him and that he give over his smartphone, which under tournament rules, the refereee is allowed to do. Bindrich refused to hand it over, saying that there was private information on the phone, and he was forfeited the game.|$|E
5|$|Making several {{attempts}} to close on Endymion, Decatur discovered that Presidents damage limited her maneuverability, allowing Endymion to anticipate, and draw away from, positions favorable for boarding. Faced {{with this new}} dilemma, Decatur ordered bar and chain shot fired to disable Endymions sails and rigging, the idea being to <b>shake</b> <b>his</b> pursuer and allow President to proceed to a safe port without being followed. At noon, Endymion, being the much better sailer, was close-hauled, outpacing her squadron and leaving them behind. At 2pm, she gained on President and took position on the American ship's quarter, shooting into President {{as she tried to}} escape. Endymion was able to rake President three times and did considerable damage to her; by contrast, President primarily directed her fire at Endymion's rigging in order to slow her down during the two-hour engagement.|$|E
5|$|On {{his trip}} to Israel in October 1985, Weizsäcker was greeted on arrival by his Israeli counterpart, President Chaim Herzog. The {{president}} was given a full honor-guard welcome at Ben-Gurion Airport; among Cabinet ministers who lined up to <b>shake</b> <b>his</b> hand were right-wingers of the Herut party, the main faction of Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud party, who had previously refused to greet German leaders. Weizsäcker's visit was the first by a head of state, but not the first by a West German leader, as Chancellor Willy Brandt had {{paid a visit to}} Israel in June 1973. During a four-day state visit to the United Kingdom in July 1986, Weizsäcker addressed a joint session of the Houses of Parliament, the first German to be accorded that honor.|$|E

5|$|Despite Bompart's {{attempts}} to disguise his destination, by {{the evening of}} 23 September Countess had correctly deduced the French were heading for Ireland, and despatched the brig Sylph to warn Commodore Warren and any other British ships she came across. Two days later, on 25 September, Commodore Bompart was forced to haul {{to the east and}} lose ground to his pursuers when a 100-ship British convoy passed to the north. This convoy consisted of many well-armed East Indiamen, protected by several frigates, and posed a serious threat to Bompart's overloaded ships. He then tried to drive off pursuit by feinting towards Countess's squadron, but the faster British ships simply withdrew to a safe distance, resuming their chase once the French had returned to their original course. On 29 September Bompart made a final bid to <b>shake</b> <b>his</b> pursuers; he attempted to engage the British frigates with three of his own—Immortalité, Loire and another. This plan failed after his flagship Hoche lost a topmast in heavy weather and fell behind the rest of the squadron, forcing the frigates to return to her protection.|$|E
5|$|During a lunchtime tryst in Phoenix, Arizona, a {{real estate}} {{secretary}} named Marion Crane discusses with her boyfriend, Sam Loomis, how they cannot afford to get married because of Sam's debts. After lunch, Marion returns to work, where a client drops off a $40,000 cash payment on a property. Her boss asks her to deposit {{the money in the}} bank, and she asks if she can take {{the rest of the afternoon}} off. Returning home, she begins to pack, deciding to steal the money and give it to Sam in Fairvale, California. She is seen by her boss on her way out of town, which makes her nervous. During the trip, she pulls over on the side of the road and falls asleep, only to be awakened by a state patrol officer. Suspicious about her nervous behavior, he notes her license plate number and follows her at a close distance. Hoping to <b>shake</b> <b>his</b> pursuit, Marion stops at an automobile dealership and trades in her Ford Mainline, with its Arizona license plates, for a Ford Custom 300 that has California tags.|$|E
5|$|In WSC's debut {{season of}} 1977–78, Chappell hit the first Supertest century and {{finished}} fifth in overall averages. The prevalence of short-pitched fast bowling {{and a serious}} injury to Australian David Hookes led to the innovation of batting helmets; Chappell {{was one of the}} many batsmen to use one. Following their 1975–76 tour of Australia, the West Indies adopted a four-man fast bowling attack, while the World XI contained fast bowlers of the calibre of Imran Khan, Mike Procter, Garth Le Roux, Clive Rice and Sarfraz Nawaz. The constant diet of pace bowling undermined the confidence of some batsmen during WSC. Chappell's form fell away during the second season and he scored only 181 runs at 25.85 in four Supertests. During the last six days of the season, the WSC Australians lost the finals of both the limited-overs competition (to the West Indies XI) and the Supertest series (to the World XI), thus forfeiting the winner-takes-all prize money. After the latter match, Chappell vented his frustrations on World XI captain Tony Greig by refusing to <b>shake</b> <b>his</b> hand and criticising Greig's inconsequential contribution to his team's victory. The final act of the competition was a series between the WSC Australians and the WSC West Indies played in the Caribbean in the spring of 1979. After the Australians suffered a heavy defeat in the first Supertest at Jamaica, Chappell rallied his team to draw the five match series one-all. His best effort were scores of 61 and 86 at Barbados.|$|E

Hitler responds by stripping Göring of his rank, ordering his arrest, and naming Robert Ritter von Greim as his replacement. Hitler then receives further upsetting news when Speer informs him that he has defied Hitler's scorched earth policy orders. Hitler does not punish Speer, {{but he does not}} <b>shake</b> <b>his</b> hand as Speer leaves.|$|E
25|$|Milne ordered Gloucester to disengage, still expecting Souchon to turn west, {{but it was}} {{apparent}} to Gloucester′s captain that Goeben was fleeing. Breslau attempted to harass Gloucester into breaking off—Souchon had a collier waiting {{off the coast of}} Greece and needed to <b>shake</b> <b>his</b> pursuer before he could rendezvous. Gloucester finally engaged Breslau, hoping this would compel Goeben to drop back and protect the light cruiser. According to Souchon, Breslau was hit, but no damage was done. The action then broke off without further hits being scored. Finally, Milne ordered Gloucester to cease pursuit at Cape Matapan.|$|E

Hong Kong media noted that Jiang left the Great Hall without shaking anyone's hand, {{and that no one}} came up to <b>shake</b> <b>his.</b> Surprisingly, Mao's successor Hua Guofeng also attended the Congress as a delegate. All the surviving members of the 14th and 15th PSC's were present, including former Premiers Li Peng and Zhu Rongji, but with the exception of Jiang rival Qiao Shi.|$|E
25|$|On 29 April 1952, Straffen {{went with}} an {{attendant}} and another patient to clean some outbuildings that {{were close to}} the 10-foot-tall external wall. In a small yard immediately adjacent to the wall was a low shed with a sloping roof that was 8½ feet high at its highest point. In the yard were empty disinfectant tins. Straffen asked his supervisor if he could <b>shake</b> <b>his</b> duster and, on receiving permission, went into the yard. Once the other patient had gone back in, Straffen climbed onto the roof and jumped over the wall. He had already made sure he had his civilian clothes under his work clothes.|$|E

Eight days later, the Chicago Police arrested Yale and Sam Pollaccia at Chicago's Union Station as {{they were about to}} depart for New York. Yale said he had come to town for the funeral of Unione Siciliana president Mike Merlo and stayed to see old friends. Yale further claimed to be having lunch at the time of O'Banion's murder.

25|$|Implicit {{memory is}} the non-declarative, or unspoken, aspects of memory. Priming, motor memory and {{classical}} conditioning are all examples of implicit memory. An example of implicit memory's {{effect on our}} social interactions has been illustrated by the pin-in-hand phenomenon. This phenomenon was first observed by Claparède while dealing with an amnesiac patient. Normally, he would shake the patient's hand and introduce himself, as the patient thought it was their first time meeting. However, on one occasion he hid a pin and pricked the patient with it when she reached to <b>shake</b> <b>his</b> hand. Later, when he offered his hand, she drew away and refused to shake, {{in spite of the}} fact she could not explicitly recall the pinprick itself. The patient was unable to provide a reason for her hesitation.|$|E
25|$|One of Clay's clients was his father-in-law, Colonel Thomas Hart, {{an early}} settler of Kentucky and a {{prominent}} businessman. Hart {{proved to be}} an important business connection for Clay, as he helped Clay gain new clients and grow in professional stature. Clay's most notable client was Aaron Burr in 1806, after the US District Attorney Joseph Hamilton Daveiss indicted him for allegedly planning an expedition into Spanish Territory west of the Mississippi River. Clay and his law partner John Allen successfully defended Burr. Some years later Thomas Jefferson convinced Clay that Daveiss had been right in his charges. Clay was so upset that many years later, when he met Burr again, Clay refused to <b>shake</b> <b>his</b> hand. Clay's legal career would continue long after his election to Congress, and in the 1823 Supreme Court case, Green v. Biddle, Clay submitted the Supreme Court's first amicus curiae.|$|E

Next morning no aircraft could be found so he had to drive to Brittany, where he visited his wife and daughters, and his aged mother (whom he never saw again, as she died in July), before taking a boat to Plymouth (he asked the skipper if {{he would be willing to}} carry on the war under British flag), where he arrived on 16 June. He ordered the boat Pasteur, with a cargo of munitions, to be diverted to a British port, which caused some members of the French Government to call for him to be put on trial.|$|E
