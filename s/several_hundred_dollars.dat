5|$|Meanwhile, both of Wiesenthal's {{employers}} terminated {{his services}} in 1960, {{as there were}} too few refugees left {{in the city to}} justify the expense. Wiesenthal opened a new documentation centre (the Documentation Centre of the Association of Jewish Victims of the Nazi Regime) in Vienna in 1961. He became a Mossad operative, for which he received the equivalent of <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>dollars</b> per month. He maintained files on hundreds of suspected Nazi war criminals and located many, about six of whom were arrested {{as a result of his}} activities. Successes included locating and bringing to trial Erich Rajakowitsch, responsible for the deportation of Jews from the Netherlands, and Franz Murer, the commandant of the Vilna Ghetto. In 1963 Wiesenthal read in the newspaper that Karl Silberbauer, the man who had arrested famed diarist Anne Frank, had been located; he was serving on the police force in Vienna. Wiesenthal's publicity campaign led to Silberbauer being temporarily suspended from the force, but he was never prosecuted for arresting the Frank family.|$|E

25|$|Production {{costs for}} this area's botrytized wines are {{comparatively}} high. The evaporation and fungus produce low yields, {{five to six}} times less than in other Bordeaux regions.

The wine is then fermented in small oak barrels, further adding to the cost. Even with half bottles of the First Growths priced at <b>several</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>dollars,</b> these wines still have difficulties turning a profit and in the mid 20th century a string of bad vintages drove many growers in the region out of business.|$|E
