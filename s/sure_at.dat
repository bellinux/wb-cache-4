500|$|The win marked Liverpool's third {{consecutive}} victory against Manchester United, but despite this, manager Houllier refused to get carried away: [...] "At the moment I am worried because the team which {{has won the}} Charity Shield {{in recent years has}} not won the title, I don't think you can draw conclusions from this match." [...] Man of the match Sander Westerveld echoed similar sentiments: [...] "It doesn't say too much about the season. Last year Chelsea beat them 2-0 and had high expectations. We played well and it's a good result but it doesn't say anything about the Championship." [...] Questions were asked about the exclusion of striker Robbie Fowler from the match-day squad, with Houllier confirming the striker had been left out after a training ground bust-up with assistant manager Phil Thompson: [...] "It is a regrettable moment for the team and the club but I'm <b>sure</b> <b>at</b> some stage common sense will prevail. I am leaving it to him. I brokered a get-together between Phil and Robbie, which I attended at the beginning. Then I left the two Scousers together. But so far it has been unsuccessful." [...] Houllier added that he had tried to resolve the issue {{before the start of the}} match: [...] "I waited until the Sunday lunchtime before the Charity Shield game. I again insisted yesterday. I took them together again. I think at some stage it will be solved. I am a patient man." ...|$|E
500|$|Though Daubeny's {{book in the}} Beagles library {{described}} the volcanic geology of the Canary Islands, it said that {{the structure of the}} Cape Verde Islands was [...] "too imperfectly known". Darwin saw Quail Island as his key to understanding the structure of St. Jago, and made careful studies of its stratigraphy in the way he had learnt from Adam Sedgwick. He collected specimens and described a white layer of hard white rock formed from crushed coral and seashells lying between layers of black volcanic rocks, and noted a similar white layer running horizontally in the black cliffs of St. Jago at [...] above sea level. The seashells were, {{as far as he could}} tell, [...] "the same as those of present day". He speculated that in geologically recent times a lava flow had covered this shell sand on the sea bed, and then the strata had slowly risen to their present level. Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology presented a thesis of gradual rising and falling of the Earth's crust illustrated by the changing levels of the Temple of Serapis. Darwin implicitly supported Lyell by remarking that [...] "Dr. Daubeny when mentioning the present state of the temple of Serapis. doubts the possibility of a surface of country being raised without cracking buildings on it. – I feel <b>sure</b> <b>at</b> St Jago in some places a town might have been raised without injuring a house." [...] In a letter to Henslow he wrote that [...] "The geology was preeminently interesting & I believe quite new: there are some facts on a large scale of upraised coast... that would interest Mr. Lyell. While still on the island, Darwin was inspired to think of writing a book on geology, and later wrote of [...] "seeing a thing never seen by Lyell, one yet saw it partially through his eyes".|$|E

Beausoleil stated that when he read about the Tate murders in the newspaper, [...] "I wasn't even <b>sure</b> <b>at</b> that point – really, I {{had no idea who}} had done it until Manson's group were actually arrested for it.

2500|$|Gardiner's theory {{plays out}} in this {{historical}} context. Olympic {{was found to be}} at blame in the collision (which, according to Gardiner, had damaged the central turbine's mountings and bent the keel, giving the ship a slight permanent list to port). Because of this finding, White Star's insurers Lloyd's of London allegedly refused to pay out on the claim. [...] White Star's flagship would also be out of action during the extensive repairs, and the Titanics completion date, which was already behind schedule due to Olympics return to the yard after her loss of a propeller blade, would have to be delayed. All this would amount to a serious financial loss for the company. Gardiner proposes that, to make <b>sure</b> <b>at</b> least one vessel would be earning money, the badly damaged Olympic was patched up and then converted to become the Titanic. [...] The real Titanic when complete would then quietly enter service as the Olympic.|$|E

But she loved the final result!". Madonna also decided to use her new country style during her public appearances for Musics promotion; including jeans, shirts and cowboy hats. On her next tour in 2001, Madonna included a segment based entirely on this ambient. Meanwhile, Fouz-Hernández explained that [...] "in this appearance Madonna may be parodying and criticizing Country, which symbolizes among other things, the supremacy of the white man, the ambition of the European pioneers and the American Dream. However, we do not realize that while recognizing the importance that the country has in American popular culture, and joins a long list of artists who have done this previously. Despite this, the cowgirl image of Madonna has become one of her most recognized reinventions.|$|E

The lyrics of [...] "Massachusetts" [...] refer to an abusive relationship and the problems one faces with it. The band nearly thought about not recording the song due to its similarity to another Silverstein song. As a compromise, the group [...] "changed it around slightly" [...] according to Told. The tracks [...] "This Is How" [...] and [...] "The Wind Shifts" [...] were written and recorded at the same time.

The scenes between Natalie and Barry have been described as some of “the most powerful moments in soap, with the couple battling to decide the fate of their unborn baby”. The character {{was seen to}} give birth to son Jack in January 2002 and her decision to keep her baby in spite of her initial determination to abort [...] has been [...] mocked by Susannah Nightingale – columnist for the Cambridge University Students' Union (CUSU) women's campaign.

Perfectly reasonable, you might think [...] but no!

[...] She said that Michael has the means, unlike some of the others, as he got Janine to tear up their prenuptial agreement before they married, and the flat that Kat's lover obtained could be listed on the books of Janine's property management business, Butcher's Joints. However, White went on to say, [...] "something tells us Kat would find it very difficult to live with herself if she was sleeping with a man whose baby is in a bad way. It seems too cruel for a mother who went though the agony of thinking she'd lost her child, so we're not <b>sure</b> <b>at</b> could cause another mum that degree of heartache. Then again, that other woman is Kat's loathed enemy, Janine." [...] Shepherd said that Kat and Michael had [...] "nice chemistry" [...] and opined that Michael [...] "would have been very keen" [...] on a relationship with Kat, that [...] "the opportunity for Michael and Kat to team up has always been there, from the moment he arrived" [...] and that the writers are placed [...] "lots of little hints to insinuate that it could be Michael".
