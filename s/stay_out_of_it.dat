The memories of the Zulu and other tribal conflicts were still fresh, and they recognised that whoever won would {{have to deal with}} {{the consequences of}} a mass militarisation of the tribes. There was therefore an unwritten agreement that this war would be a [...] "white man's war." [...] At the outset, British officials instructed all white magistrates in the Natal Colony to appeal to Zulu amakhosi (chiefs) to remain neutral, and President Kruger sent emissaries asking them to <b>stay</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> However, in some cases there were old scores to be settled, and some Africans, such as the Swazis, were eager to enter the war with the specific aim of reclaiming land confiscated by the Boers. As the war went on there was greater involvement of Africans, and in particular large numbers became embroiled in the conflict on the British side, either voluntarily or involuntarily. By the end of the war, many blacks had been armed and had shown conspicuous gallantry in roles such as scouts, messengers, watchmen in blockhouses, and auxiliaries.|$|E
