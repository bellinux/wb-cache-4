40|$|Argo {{observations}} from 2005 to 2013 {{are used to}} characterize spatial scales of temperature and salinity variations from the surface down to 1300  m. Simulations are first performed to analyze the sensitivity of results to Argo sampling; they show that several years of Argo observations are required to estimate spatial scales of ocean variability over 20 ° [*]×[*]  20 ° boxes. Spatial scales are then computed over several large-scale areas. Zonal and meridional spatial scales (L x and L y which are zero crossing of covariance functions) vary as expected with latitudes. Scales are of about 100  km at high latitudes and more of 700  km in the Indian and Pacific equatorial–tropical regions. Zonal and meridional scales are similar except in tropical–equatorial regions where zonal scales are much larger (by a factor of 2 to 3) than meridional scales. Spatial scales are the largest {{close to the surface}} and have a general tendency for temperature to increase in deeper layers. There are significant differences between temperature and <b>salinity</b> <b>scales,</b> in particular, in the deep ocean. Results are consistent with previous studies based on sparse in situ observations or satellite altimetry.

5000|$|Although {{the vast}} {{majority}} of seawater has a salinity of between 31 g/kg and 38 g/kg, that is 3.1-3.8%, seawater is not uniformly saline throughout the world. Where mixing occurs with fresh water runoff from river mouths, near melting glaciers or vast amounts of precipitation (e.g. Monsoon), seawater can be substantially less saline. The most saline open sea is the Red Sea, where high rates of evaporation, low precipitation and low river run-off, and confined circulation result in unusually salty water. The salinity in isolated bodies of water can be considerably greater still - about ten times higher {{in the case of the}} Dead Sea. Historically, several <b>salinity</b> <b>scales</b> were used to approximate the absolute salinity of seawater. A popular scale was the [...] "Practical Salinity Scale" [...] where salinity was measured in [...] "practical salinity units (psu)".

40|$|Plant {{communities}} are disturbed by several stressors {{and they are}} expected to be further impacted by increasing anthropogenic stress. The consequences of these stressors will depend, in part, upon the ability of plants to compensate for herbivory. Previous studies found that herbivore impacts on plants can vary from negative to positive because of environmental control of plant compensatory responses, a. k. a. the Compensatory Continuum Hypothesis. While these influential studies enhanced our appreciation of the dynamic nature of plant-herbivore interactions, they largely focused on the impact of resource limitation. This bias limits our ability to predict how other environmental factors will shape the impact of herbivory. We examined the role of salinity stress on herbivory of salt marsh cordgrass, Spartina foliosa, by an herbivore previously hypothesized to influence the success of restoration projects (the scale insect, Haliaspis spartinae). Using a combination of field and mesocosm manipulations of <b>scales</b> and <b>salinity,</b> we measured how these factors affected Spartina growth and timing of senescence. In mesocosm studies, Spartina overcompensated for herbivory by growing taller shoots at low salinities but the impact of scales on plants switched from positive to neutral with increasing salinity stress. In field studies of intermediate <b>salinities,</b> <b>scales</b> reduced Spartina growth and increased the rate of senescence. Experimental salinity additions at this field site returned the impact of scales to neutral. Because <b>salinity</b> decreased <b>scale</b> densities, the switch in impact of scales on Spartina with increasing salinity was not simply a linear function of scale abundance. Thus, th...|$|R

Salinities on this scale are determined by combining electrical conductivity measurements with other information that can account for regional changes in the composition of seawater.

5000|$|A {{remarkable}} {{feature of}} the Sea of Azov is the large complex of shallow lagoons called Sivash or [...] "Rotten Sea". Their typical depth is only 0.5-1 metres with a maximum of 3 metres. They cover an area of 2560 km2 in the northeastern Crimea which is separated from the sea by the Arabatsk Spit. North of the spit lies the city of Henichesk (population 22,500) and south {{of it is the}} Bay of Arabat. Sivash accepts up to 1.5 km3 of Azov water per year. Because of the lagoons' wide extent and shallowness, the water rapidly evaporates, resulting in the high salinity of 170 on the practical <b>salinity</b> <b>scale</b> (i.e. 170 psu). For this reason Sivash has long had an important salt-producing industry.|$|E

40|$|The {{conservative}} {{behavior of}} uranium (U) {{with respect to}} salinity in open ocean waters is widely accepted. However, in low salinity oceanic environments, such as estuaries, its behavior seems more variable and information on its distribution over broad <b>salinity</b> <b>scales</b> {{still needs to be}} further documented. Sea ice formation in polar oceans constitutes a natural mechanism concentrating dissolved seawater constituents into high salinity brine through the distillation of "pure" water into sea ice. Here we present relative U-concentration data in fifteen samples from the Arctic Ocean. They include low-salinity sea ice, underlying surface seawater and sea ice brine covering a salinity range of ~ 0 to 135. Results suggest that U vs. salinity exhibits conservative behavior over the whole range of salinity investigated. In addition, δ 234 U measurements agree well with the mean oceanic 234 U/ 238 U ratio, suggesting that the processes of sea ice formation and melt do not affect the oceanic relationship between the 234 U and 238 U. © 2011 Elsevier B.

Over an annual cycle, the variability is dominated by eastern and western basin SSS “poles,” with seasonal ranges up to 6. 5 pss (practical <b>salinity</b> <b>scale),</b> that vary out of phase by 6 months and largely compensate each other. A much smaller SSS range (0. 08 pss) is observed for {{the region as a}} whole. The dominant processes controlling SSS variability are investigated using GPCPv 2. 2 precipitation (P), OAFlux evaporation (E), and Dai and Trenberth river flow (R) data sets. For the western pole, SSS varies in phase with P and lags R by 1 – 2 months; a more complex relationship holds for the eastern pole.

Beside <b>salinity,</b> <b>scaling</b> formation {{is one of the}} major problems that slow down heat transfer and cause system failures. Prevention and minimizing scale formation is highly important in the thermal solar desalination. So, the present study aims to studying individually the chemical characteristics affecting groundwater quality in inland and coastal regions of El Gebail and El Qaa plain areas southwest Sinai to evaluate and map them as feed water for thermal desalination plants. In addition, preparation of scale prediction modeling to estimate deposits on heat exchanger surfaces in distillation units has also been covered. Twenty-four water samples were collected from the study area and chemically analyzed. Water samples in El Qaa plain are of good water quality and can be used for different purposes. Water samples in El Gebail have excess salts for major wells and cannot be used without desalination. Saturation indices for different minerals are carefully studied. The scale prediction based on PHREEQC modeling was employed. In addition, laboratory experimental for evaluation scale precipitation after different recovery percentages of pure water from saline water was used. Results indicate that about 31  % of water samples in El Gebail region are faint coating, 38  % are mild scale forming, and 31  % are mild corrosion. Also, using PHREEQC for simulated evaporation with continuous water feeding of water sample can be used as a technique to quantitatively estimate the impending scale formation in solar desalination systems, which is very important to discover the best location for carrying out solar desalination. Also, the best operating procedure conditions and the best system designs were identified.|$|R
40|$|Coarse {{sea salt}} {{particles}} are emitted ubiquitously {{from the ocean}} surface by wave-breaking and bubble-bursting processes. These particles impact the atmospheric chemistry by affecting the condensation of gas-phase species and, thus, indirectly the nucleation of new fine particles, particularly in regions with significant air pollution. In this study, atmospheric particle concentrations are modeled for the North Sea and Baltic Sea regions in northwestern Europe using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system and are compared to European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) measurement data. The sea salt emission module is extended by a salinity-dependent scaling of the sea salt emissions because the salinity in {{large parts of the}} Baltic Sea is very low, which leads to considerably lower sea salt mass emissions compared to other oceanic regions. The resulting improvement in predicted sea salt concentrations is assessed. The contribution of surf zone emissions is considered separately. Additionally, the impacts of sea salt particles on atmospheric nitrate and ammonium concentrations and on nitrogen deposition are evaluated. The comparisons with observational data show that sea salt concentrations are commonly overestimated at coastal stations and partly underestimated farther inland. The introduced <b>salinity</b> <b>scaling</b> improves the predicted Baltic Sea sea salt concentrations considerably. The dates of measured peak concentrations are appropriately reproduced by the model. The impact of surf zone emissions is negligible in both seas. Nevertheless, they might be relevant because surf zone emissions were cut at an upper threshold in this study. Deactivating sea salt leads to minor increases in NH 3 +  NH 4 + and HNO 3 +  NO 3 − and a decrease in NO 3 − concentrations. However, the overall effect on NH 3 +  NH 4 + and HNO 3 +  NO 3 − concentrations is smaller than the deviation from the measurements. Nitrogen wet deposition is underestimated by the model at most stations. In coastal regions, the total nitrogen deposition (wet and dry) is considerably affected by sea salt particles.

The possible mechanisms for the freshening are investigated using the surface freshwater flux (E-P) data, the ECCO outputs and a salt budget equation for the upper ocean. Our analysis indicates that the magnitude of the salinity change caused by the surface freshwater flux anomaly is far smaller than observed, suggesting that the surface freshwater flux anomaly is not sufficient to account for the observed freshening. In fact, the salinity anomaly is closely linked to a pronounced freshening at the northeast corner of the study area from 2003 to 2007. The advection of salinity anomalies in the western North Pacific Ocean between 25 degrees N and 35 degrees N via a southwestward flow in the "C-shaped" region associated with the Kuroshio system is the main mechanism responsible for the observed freshening in the study area...|$|E

However, current understanding is based overwhelmingly on natural systems {{and there have}} been few assessments of zooplankton spatial pattern in artificial lakes subjected to intensive management. Here, we investigate spatial structure among crustacean zooplankton at scales ranging from 1 m to 2700 m in the newly-formed Cardiff Bay (UK). We hypothesised that zooplankton spatial structuring in Cardiff Bay would be weakened by artificial aeration that was expected to create intense, continuous disturbance that homogenised physico-chemical conditions. Water quality across Cardiff Bay varied only moderately, and variations in zooplankton community composition were weakly related to temperature, oxygen, chlorophyll-a concentration and <b>salinity</b> at <b>scales</b> of around 2 km. However, spatial pattern explained over 60 % of variance in zooplankton composition at the smallest scales (0 - 5 m), implying that inter-specific interactions were involved. Additionally, the numerically dominant zooplankton (Daphnia hyalina (Leydig 1860), Eurytemora affinis (Poppe 1880) and Eucyclops agilis (Koch 1838)) had highly contagious distributions in warmer locations with increased chlorophyll-a reflecting aggregated response to abundant food. These data suggest that local biotic interactions among zooplankton and broader-scale links between dominant species and their algal food are sufficiently intense to persist despite the homogenising effects of artificial aeration and lake mixing. Such spatial pattern and scale-dependence has ramifications for zooplankton sampling while illustrating the self-organising capacity of predator-prey interactions even in novel, disturbed environments...|$|R
40|$|As one of few {{who have}} been {{involved}} in the equation of state of seawater over the last 40 years, the author was invited to review some of the history behind its early development and also the more recent thermodynamic equation of state. The article first reviews early (late 1800 s) work by Knudsen and others in defining the concept of salinity. This summary leads into the development of the practical <b>salinity</b> <b>scale.</b> Our studies at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School, along with the work of Alain Poisson’s group at Laboratoire de Physique et Chimie, Université Pierre et Marie Curie and that of Alvin Bradshaw and Karl Schleicher at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, were instrumental in deriving the 1980 equation of state (EOS- 80) that has been used for 30 years. The fundamental work of Ranier Feistel at Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research led to the development of a Gibbs free energy function that is the backbone of the new thermodynamic equation of state (TEOS- 10). It can be used to determine all of the thermodynamic properties of seawater. The salinity input to the TEOS- 10 Gibbs function requires knowledge of the absolute salinity of seawater (SA), which is based upon the reference salinity of seawater (SR). The reference salinity is our best estimate of the absolute salinity of the seawater that was used to develop the practical <b>salinity</b> <b>scale</b> (SP), the equation of state, and the other thermodynamic properties of seawater. Reference salinity is related to practical salinity by SR = SP (35. 16504 / 35. 000) g kg- 1 and absolute salinity is related to reference salinity by SA = SR + δSA,where δSA is due to the added solutes in seawater in deep waters resulting from the dissolution of CaCO 3 (s) and SiO 2 (s), CO 2, and nutrients like NO 3 and PO 4 from the oxidation of plant material. The δSA values due to the added solutes are estimated from the differences between the measured densities of seawater samples compared with the densities calculated from the TEOS- 10 equation of state (Δρ) at the same reference salinity, temperature, and pressure, using δSA = Δρ/ 0. 75179 g kg- 1. The values of δSA in the ocean can be estimated for waters at given longitude, latitude, and depth using correlations of δSA and the concentration of Si(OH) 4 in the waters. The SA values can then be used to calculate all the thermodynamic properties of seawater in the major oceans using the new TEOS- 10.

It {{is based on an}} original compilation of all available in situ SSS observations in that region, assembled in a 2 °-resolution trimonthly gridded field. We find that year-to-year SSS variability is particularly strong in the North-Eastern part of the Bay. Over recent years, this variability takes the form of two successive and opposite phases: a saltening phase from mid- 2009 to late 2010, immediately followed by a freshening phase from late 2010 to late 2011. The typical magnitude of each anomalous spell is about one in the practical <b>salinity</b> <b>scale,</b> making this area one of the most variable of the tropical oceans at interannual timescales. A simple mixed-layer salt budget indicates that year-to-year large-scale SSS variability in the Northern Bay of Bengal is primarily driven by freshwater fluxes variability with a correlation of 0. 68, with rather independent contributions from precipitation and river runoff. The oceanic surface circulation variability contributes less systematically to the large-scale SSS evolution in the Northern Bay of Bengal over the entire record with a correlation of 0. 13, despite a strong contribution at times, in particular during the 2011 positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) freshening...|$|E

Also the water samples have {{a significant amount of}} calcium sulphate and small amount of calcium carbonate. Using PHREEQC to simulate feed water evaporation with continuous water feeding allows quantification of changes in solution composition during pure water recovery and allows simulation of the effects of these changes on precipitation of subsequent scale-forming solids. The resulting simulated saturation indices values could be used to quantitatively assess the potential of a given feed water to form scale or to compare the possibility of a number of feed waters to form scale during solar desalination. Simulated model of feed waters cannot perfectly predict the surroundings under which scale will form due to the effects of potentially stable supersaturated solutions, solution velocity, and residence time inside the mix tank of the desalination systems. However, the simulated scale-forming potential of planned feed waters could be compared with the actual scale-forming properties of feed waters, as operational histories in desalination systems are already known. This may provide a technique to estimate the actual performance of proposed feed waters under optimum set of conditions. The experimental data could validate the technique described in this study as a regular method for assessing the suitability of intended feed waters for solar thermal desalination.

The results show that the part due to the PSS- 78 relations fits is sometimes as much significant as the instruments one's. This is particularly the case with CTD measurements where correlations between the variables contribute to decrease largely the uncertainty on S, even when the expanded uncertainties on conductivity cells calibrations are largely up of 0. 002 mS/cm.

40|$|Salinity plays a {{key role}} in the {{determination}} of the thermodynamic properties of seawater and the new TEOS- 10 1 standard provides a consistent and effective approach to dealing with relationships between salinity and these thermodynamic properties. However, there are a number of practical issues that arise in the application of TEOS- 10, both in terms of accuracy and scope, including its use in the reduction of field data and in numerical models. First, in the TEOS- 10 formulation for IAPSO Standard Seawater, the Gibbs function takes the Reference Salinity as its salinity argument, denoted SR, which provides a measure of the mass fraction of dissolved material in solution based on the Reference Composition approximation for Standard Seawater. We discuss uncertainties in both the Reference Composition and the Reference-Composition <b>Salinity</b> <b>Scale</b> on which Reference Salinity is reported. The Reference Composition provides a much-needed fixed benchmark but modified reference states will inevitably be required to improve the representation of Standard Seawater for some studies. The Reference-Composition <b>Salinity</b> <b>Scale</b> should remain unaltered to provide a stable representation of salinity for use with the TEOS- 10 Gibbs function and in climate change detection studies. Second, when composition anomalies are present in seawater, no single salinity variable can fully represent the influence of dissolved material on the thermodynamic properties of seawater. We consider three distinct representations of salinity that have been used in previous studies and discuss the connections and distinctions between them. One of these variables provides the most accurate representation of density possible as well as improvements over Reference Salinity for the determination of other thermodynamic properties. It is referred to as "Density Salinity" and is represented by the symbol SAdens; it stands out as the most appropriate representation of salinity for use in dynamical physical oceanography. The other two salinity variables provide alternative measures of the mass fraction of dissolved material in seawater. "Solution Salinity", denoted SAsoln, is the most obvious extension of Reference Salinity to allow for composition anomalies; it provides a direct estimate of the mass fraction of dissolved material in solution. "Added-Mass Salinity", denoted SAadd, is motivated by a method used to report laboratory experiments; it represents the component of dissolved material added to Standard Seawater in terms of the mass of material before it enters solution. We also discuss a constructed conservative variable referred to as "Preformed Salinity", denoted S*, which will be useful in process-oriented numerical modelling studies. Finally, a conceptual framework for the incorporation of composition anomalies in numerical models is presented that builds from studies in which composition anomalies are simply ignored up to studies in which the influences of composition anomalies are accounted for using the results of biogeochemical models. 1 TEOS- 10 : international thermodynamic equation of seawater 2010, <a href="[URL]...|$|E
40|$|As {{seawater}} circulates {{through the}} global ocean, its relative composition undergoes small variations. This results in {{changes to the}} conductivity/salinity/density relationship, which is currently well-defined only for Standard Seawater obtained from a particular area in the North Atlantic. These changes are investigated here by analysis of laboratory experiments in which salts are added to seawater, by analysis of oceanic observations of density and composition anomalies, and by mathematical investigation using a model relating composition, conductivity, and density of arbitrary seawaters. Mathematical analysis shows that understanding and describing the effect of changes in relative composition on operational estimates of salinity using the Practical <b>Salinity</b> <b>Scale</b> 1978 and on density using an equation of state for Standard Seawater {{require the use of}} a number of different salinity variables and a family of haline contraction coefficients. These salinity variables include an absolute Salinity SAsoln, a density salinity SAdens, the reference salinity SR, and an added-mass salinity SAadd. In addition, a new salinity variable S&lowast; is defined, which represents the preformed salinity of a Standard Seawater component of real seawater to which biogeochemical processes add material. In spite of this complexity, observed correlations between different ocean biogeochemical processes allow the creation of simple formulas {{that can be used to}} convert between the different salinity and density measures, allowing for the operational reduction of routine oceanographic observations...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe combine 12 -year long hydrographic {{data from}} a ship of {{opportunity}} with altimetric sea level data to infer the distribution and genesis of surface meso scale frontal structures in the Irminger Sea, detected on a salinity criterion. We find a complex spatial pattern in the occurrence of fronts: preferential locations are found both {{in the interior of}} the basin, and {{in the vicinity of the}} Irminger Current, a major current flowing along the western slope of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, that separates contrasted surface water masses. These regions of high density of fronts do not systematically match regions of high eddy kinetic energy, but the occurrence of increased horizontal gradients is usually associated with confluence. We were able to reproduce reasonably well the spatial variability of fronts, by a simple model that passively advects the large <b>scale</b> <b>salinity</b> climatology with the altimetry-derived surface velocities. We find that stirring induced by meso scale turbulence as well as displacements of water masses are important contributors to the genesis of fronts. Thus, these fronts are often the result of a non-local process...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT- During {{the first}} decade of the next {{millennium}} Earth Observation from satellites will be faced with two major demands, i. e. provision of continuity missions and launch of new exploratory missions. This paper addresses plans for new Earth observations in the context of Ocean Observing System for Climate at the onset of the next millennium. It highlights three quantities including ice mass fluctuations, sea surface salinity and fine resolution marine geoid. Their relevance and importance for climate are briefly reviewed in connection with important processes such as for example thermohaline circulation, sea level change, and evolution of large <b>scale</b> <b>salinity</b> events. The associated candidate satellite mission concepts are then presented in light of their objectives, scientific observation requirements and degree of complementarity and synergy. 1. INTRODUCTION. During {{the first decade}} of the next millennium relatively long time series (in some cases almost 30 years) of satellite derived quantities (including sea surface temperature, ocean wave field, near surface wind, ocean color, sea surface topography and sea ice extent, types and concentration) will becom...|$|R
40|$|Aim Three-quarters of Octocorallia {{species are}} found in deep waters. These cold-water octocoral colonies can form a major {{constituent}} of structurally complex habitats. The global distribution and the habitat requirements of deep-sea octocorals are poorly understood given the expense and difficulties of sampling at depth. Habitat suitability models are useful tools to extrapolate distributions and provide an understanding of ecological requirements. Here, we present global habitat suitability models and distribution maps for seven suborders of Octocorallia: Alcyoniina, Calcaxonia, Holaxonia, Scleraxonia, Sessiliflorae, Stolonifera and Subselliflorae. Location Global. Methods We use maximum entropy modelling to predict octocoral distribution using a database of 12, 508 geolocated octocoral specimens and 32 environmental grids resampled to 30 arc-second (approximately 1 km 2) resolution. Additionally, a meta-analysis determined habitat preferences and niche overlap between the different suborders of octocorals. Results Suborder Sessiliflorae had the widest potential habitat range, but all records for all suborders implied a habitat preference for continental shelves and margins, particularly the North and West Atlantic and Western Pacific Rim. Temperature, <b>salinity,</b> broad <b>scale</b> slope, productivity, oxygen and calcite saturation state were identified as important factors for determining habitat suitability. Less than 3 % of octocoral records were found in waters undersaturated for calcite, but this result is affected by a shallow-water sampling bias. Main conclusions The logistical difficulties, expense and vast areas associated with deep-sea sampling leads to {{a gap in the}} knowledge of faunal distributions that is difficult to fill without predictive modelling. Global distribution estimates are presented, highlighting many suitable areas which have yet to be studied. We suggest that approximately 17 % of oceans are suitable for at least one suborder but 3. 5 % may be suitable for all seven. This is the first global habitat suitability modelling study on the distribution of octocorals and forms a useful resource for researchers, managers and conservationists. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|R
