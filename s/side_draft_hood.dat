40|$|A common {{industrial}} ventilation and pollution problem results when a thermally buoyant polluted plume of air must be exhausted {{away from a}} work area to allow achievement of air pollution standards. Generally, a close fitting canopy hood {{is one of the}} most effective means of exhaust containment; however, physical restrictions or the operation itself often prevent such an arrangement, and a hood located to the side of the operation is required. This arrangement requires the exhaust to bend and contain the vertically rising plume with a horizontal sweep of exhaust air across the surface of the operation. A review of available literature revealed a lack of the necessary theory and data needed to design a <b>side</b> <b>draft</b> <b>hood</b> based on plume dynamics. The purpose of this study, then, is to develop the theory relating the <b>side</b> <b>draft</b> <b>hood</b> size and required exhaust volume to the hot source characteristics and to test the theory in the laboratory...|$|E

5000|$|Typically, {{residential}} and industrial evaporative coolers use direct evaporation, {{and can be}} described as an enclosed metal or plastic box with vented sides. Air is moved by a centrifugal fan or blower, (usually driven by an electric motor with pulleys known as [...] "sheaves" [...] in HVAC terminology, or a direct-driven axial fan), and a water pump is used to wet the evaporative cooling pads. The cooling units can be mounted on the roof (down draft, or downflow), or exterior walls or windows (<b>side</b> <b>draft,</b> or horizontal flow) of buildings. To cool, the fan draws ambient air through vents on the unit's sides and through the damp pads. Heat in the air evaporates water from the pads which are constantly re-dampened to continue the cooling process. Then cooled, moist air is delivered into the building via a vent in the roof or wall.|$|R

5000|$|While it {{retained}} the [...] "Bubble Window" [...] styling, it {{differed from the}} Italian model in that its headlamps were fixed separately {{to the sides of}} the bodywork and it carried the BMW badge below the windscreen.

However, the head was rotated by 180° compared with the motorcycle engine. The twin-bearing crankshaft was also different in the Isetta power unit, being larger and featuring reinforced bearings. One of the reasons for this was the heavy Dynastart unit which combined the dynamo and self-starter. The fuel mixture was provided by a Bing sliding throttle <b>side</b> <b>draft</b> motorcycle carburetor. In addition to further changes of detail, the BMW engineers enlarged the sump for installation in the car and cooled the engine by means of a radial fan and shrouded ducting.|$|R

40|$|Serbia, as {{a member}} of the former Yugoslavia, has Administrative {{procedure}} Act since 1930. This Law has been made under the model of Austrian Administrative Procedure Act of 1925. This Law has been verified through praxis of almost one century. Lately, Serbian Ministry of Justice and Public Administration prepared Draft Law on Administrative Procedure which is totally different from existing Law. Draft Law is combination of the rules taken from the new Croatian Administrative Procedure Act of 2010, which is far from being verified in praxis. On the other <b>side,</b> <b>Draft</b> is full of disputable theoretical definitions, which makes this text similar to 'scientific' article or book. Existing Administrative Procedure Act is in all senses much better than the Draft. With some minor changes this Law would be perfect and could be used easily in the praxis.

Right {{from the start}} of production in 1971 for the Series 3 E-Type, the V12 engine had Lucas OPUS electronic ignition. This system was used until 1982 when the Lucas CEI system was introduced. Initially the OPUS ignition amplifier unit was secured directly to the engine between the cylinder heads and had problems due to overheating. Later cars had the ignition amplifier moved away from the engine where it could get air flow for cooling. Originally the V12 was supposed to get an advanced fuel injection system under development by AE Brico but this plan was cancelled at a late stage, possibly due to concerns that the design was too similar to Bosch products.
