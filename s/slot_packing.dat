40|$|Planar {{non-overlapping}} concentrated windings {{are simple}} to wind and robust in operation. Since the coils may be preformed before stator construction they yield a high <b>slot</b> <b>packing</b> factor. However all {{the forms of}} the windings produce backward going fields, which can detract from their performance when used in induction machines. A novel system has recently been developed to cancel the backward going fields and produce good performance from these simple windings. Starting with this system the paper develops a number of single-sided machines using multi layered planar coils and analyzes their performance. Machines using these windings are apt for higher voltages and are efficient to construct, with savings in both labor and material costs. The winding layouts for various forms of multi layer planar machine have been outlined and the good performance of these machines has been established compared to conventional two layer windings by both 3 D finite element analysis and experimental methods...|$|E
50|$|Many homebrew programmers have {{encountered}} difficult to navigate obstacles while developing their projects {{as a result}} of the DS's relatively weak CPU and little RAM compared to PCs of the time. The introduction of the Nintendo DS Memory Expansion Pak (included with Nintendo DS Browser) and the recent inclusion of extra RAM in some Slot-2 devices (SuperCard SD/CF/Lite, EZ3-in-1), as well as the 1GB of NAND memory in the Acekard RPG, and a GBA <b>slot</b> expansion <b>pack</b> with the M3 Real has allowed programmers to overcome some of these obstacles.|$|R
50|$|The {{collation}} of {{the cards}} {{made it possible for}} a basic land card to appear in the common and uncommon <b>slots</b> of a <b>pack.</b> This was intentional; the land cards were printed on the common and uncommon print sheets. Basic lands would get their own full print sheets in 4th Edition, making Revised the last tournament-legal set until Seventh Edition in which basic lands could be found in booster packs. Basic lands returned as a card slot in the Shards of Alara block of 2008.|$|R
25|$|The player {{starts with}} {{a limited number of}} seed pack types and seed <b>pack</b> <b>slots</b> that they can use during most levels. The number of slots can be {{increased}} through purchases with in-game money. At the start of a level, the player is shown the various types of zombies to expect and given the opportunity to select which seed packs to take into the level. Several plants are nocturnal, such as mushrooms, having a lower sunlight cost, and are ideal for nighttime levels. Certain plants are highly effective against specific types of zombies, such as the Magnet-shroom, which can remove metallic items from a zombie, such as helmets, buckets, ladders, and pogosticks.|$|R
50|$|At {{the bottom}} of wells, based on formation, a {{screening}} device, filter <b>pack,</b> <b>slotted</b> casing, or open bore hole is left to allow {{the flow of water}} into the well. Constructed screens are typically used in unconsolidated formations (sands, gravels, etc.), allowing water and a percentage of the formation to pass through the screen. Allowing some material to pass through creates a large area filter out {{of the rest of the}} formation, as the amount of material present to pass into the well slowly decreases and is removed from the well. Rock wells are typically cased with a PVC liner/casing and screen or slotted casing at the bottom, this is mostly present just to keep rocks from entering the pump assembly. Some wells utilize a filter pack method, where an undersized screen or slotted casing is placed inside the well and a filter medium is packed around the screen, between the screen and the borehole or casing. This allows the water to be filtered of unwanted materials before entering the well and pumping zone.|$|R
40|$|Much of Pakistan's 13 million ha of {{irrigated}} land is underlain by the Indus River System alluvial complex, which forms a highly transmissive aquifer, often saturated {{to within a}} few metres of ground surface. Since the 1960 s, public well fields have been installed in this aquifer for water table control and for providing supplementary i rigation water. The early well designs utilized unprotected mild steel components, creens with saw-cut <b>slots</b> and filter <b>packs</b> of 'pea gravel'. These suffered {{from a number of}} drawbacks, including sand pumping and rapid specific apacity deterioration, attributed at the time to corrosion and associated incrustation of the well screens. Design modifications, introducing finer, graded gravel, a more suitable slot size and corrosion resistant materials, resulted in an almost immediate solution of the short-term problems. However, long-term performance monitoring has disclosed slow but serious well deterioration, the causes of which are still not understood. Circumstantial evidence suggests that this deterioration is at least partly due to some chemical mechanism, probably affecting the formation/gravel filter interface. Systematic studies and rehabilitation trials are urgently required to establish effective remedial measures for existing wells and modifica-tions of design for future wells...|$|R
40|$|The {{ironmaking}} {{blast furnace}} (BF) {{is a complex}} reaction vessel involving counter-, coand/ or cross-current flows of gas, powder, liquid, and solids. However, the interactions of these multiphase flows have not been completely understood. The objective of this thesis {{is to develop a}} suitable model to simulate the powder flow and accumulation in packed beds and then extend it to numerically investigate the multiphase flow in the furnace. Gas-powder flow in a <b>slot</b> type <b>packed</b> bed has been experimentally studied {{in order to understand the}} flow and accumulation behaviour of powder in systems like an ironmaking blast furnace. A variety of variables including gas flowrate, powder flowrate and packing properties have been taken into consideration. It is found that a clear and stable accumulation region can form in the low gas-powder velocity zone at the bottom of the bed. The accumulation region is stable and shows strong hysteresis. The distribution of softening-melting layers in the blast furnace known as the cohesive zone (CZ) is modelled by inserting solid blocks into the bed. The results indicate that the inverse-V cohesive zone shape leads to low powder accumulation within the CZ and at the corner of the bed. A mathematical model is proposed to describe gas-powder flow in a bed packed with particles. The model is the same as the two fluid model developed on the basis of the space-averaged theorem in terms of the governing equations but extended to consider the interactions between gas, powder and packed particles, as well as the static and dynamic holdups of powder. In particular, a method is proposed to determine the boundary between dynamic and stagnant zones with respect to powder phase, i. e. the profile of the powder accumulation zone. The validity of numerical modelling is examined by comparing the predicted and measured distributions of powder flow and accumulation under various flow conditions. With high PCI rate operations, a large quantity of unburned coal/char fines flow together with the gas into the blast furnace. Under some operating conditions, the holdup of fines results in deterioration of furnace permeability and lower production efficiency. Therefore, the proposed model is applied to simulate the powder (unburnt coal/char) flow and accumulation inside the blast furnace when operating with different cohesive zone (CZ) shapes. The results indicate that powder is likely to accumulate at the lower part of W-shaped CZs and the upper part of V- and inverse V-shaped CZs. In addition, for the same CZ shape, a thick cohesive layer can lead to a large pressure drop while the resistance of narrow cohesive layers to gas-powder flow is found to be relatively small. Gas-powder flow in moving beds of solid particles has been numerically investigated, under conditions related to the ironmaking blast furnace and high rate pulverized coal injection. A new correlation, which is formulated to describe static powder holdup in a moving packed bed, is incorporated into the previous mathematical model and applied to a description of gas-powder flow in a blast furnace. Compared with the results of fixed beds, the results show that the solids descent due to the consumption of ore, coke and unburnt char in various regions, together with the non-uniform structural distribution, significantly affects powder flow and accumulation in a blast furnace. Finally, liquid flow is simulated through force balance approach and numerical results are compared with the different liquid inlet distribution under the iron-making blast furnace conditions with gas flow. The results show that the effect of inlet distribution on liquid flow is significant in the upper part of coke region in BF and possible loading and dry zone can be numerically identified. Then, this part of work is incorporated to the developed gas-powder-solid modelling system to investigate the influence of liquid phase on other phases flow in the blast furnace although heat transfer and chemistry are not considered in the model...|$|R
