Nevertheless, Galley didn't <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> with these fighters being stationed in Angola and Mozambique, especially since France had already sold Mirage fighters to South Africa.|$|E
2500|$|City {{residents}} had mixed reactions to crossing sweepers and their presence on urban streets. Richard Rowe viewed crossing-sweeping as [...] "little {{better than a}} make-believe of work, as a pretext for begging, either directly or by suggestion." [...] Rowe did not <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> with [...] "alms-giving" [...] to elderly or disabled crossing sweepers, but overall wanted to see their ranks [...] "thinned considerably - viz., by {{the elimination of the}} adults who are able, and the young who might be trained to do something better..." [...] A writer in an 1858 issue of Building News expressed a similarly negative sentiment when referring to [...] "those juvenile highwayman who, broom in hand, take possessions of our crossings and level black mail upon the public in general, and timid females in particular." ...|$|E
2500|$|Egyptologists <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> {{with the}} story of Solomon and Pharaoh's daughter. The issue {{lies in the fact that}} there is no record of Egyptian princesses around this time being used to form alliances through marriage. As Brian Roberts stated, [...] "The problem is not with the {{synchronism}} of Solomon and [...] Siamun per se, yet with the problems of attempting to fit the process of marrying out a daughter to a foreign leader. It is not a thing the ultra-orthodox Dynasty 21 would have done... We have an earlier example of the opposite, in fact. The king of the Mitanni had asked Amenhotep II for his daughter's hand in order to cement a political alliance. Amenhotep refused, offended by the suggestion that an Egyptian princess be submitted for that ridicule of being married off to a foreign leader." ...|$|E

25|$|As stated above, much of Concerned Women for America's {{concern with}} {{pornography}} {{is a result}} of their familial ideals. The CWA <b>sees</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> with men becoming addicted to pornography and women being unable to compete with the ideal woman in pornography.|$|R

2500|$|Hinting expert Beat Stamm, {{who worked}} on ClearType at Microsoft, agrees that ClearType may look blurry at 96 dpi, which was a typical {{resolution}} for LCDs in 2008, but adds that higher resolution displays improve on this aspect: [...] "WPF [...] uses method C , but few display devices have a sufficiently high resolution to make the potential blur a moot point for everybody.... Some people are ok with the blur in Method C, some aren’t. Anecdotal evidence suggests {{that some people are}} fine with Method C when reading continuous text at 96 dpi (e.g. Times Reader, etc.) but not in UI scenarios. Many people are fine with the colors of ClearType, even at 96 dpi, but a few aren’t… To my eyes and at 96 dpi, Method C doesn’t read as well as Method A. It reads “blurrily” to me. Conversely, at 144 dpi, I don’t <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> with Method C. It looks and reads just fine to me." [...] One illustration of the potential problem is the following image: ...|$|E
2500|$|People {{close to}} Zahau {{expressed}} {{doubt that she}} would have committed suicide. Zahau's elder sister {{said in an interview that}} [...] "I still believe my sister didn't take her life", and in a written statement on behalf of the family wrote that [...] "Rebecca valued her life and lived her life to its fullest. Rebecca loved God, her family and life." [...] Her younger sister commented more strongly by e-mail, [...] "Becky did not commit suicide. My sister was murdered." [...] Her former trainer also stated that [...] "She was always happy [...] always smiling when she came in. I didn't <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> or anything like that." [...] Family members disputed police characterizations of Zahau as depressed, describing her instead that as a happy person. Furthermore, they state that Zahau believed as a Christian that suicide was wrong. After the suicide ruling, Neil Nalepa was quoted as stating, [...] "I would not believe Rebecca would commit suicide. It’s out of character." [...] However, Sheriff Bill Gore, who investigated the death, stated of the family's reluctance to accept the suicide ruling, [...] "We laid out the case extensively to them in Missouri to answer their questions, and it’s unfortunate she can't accept the results." [...] On September 7, the family launched a website [...] seeking donations to fund their own investigation into Zahau's death. The site states: [...] "It was obvious that the Sheriff’s Department had worked too hard to paint this picture of suicide and they were not about to let the Zahaus ruin it." [...] In late September, they continued to demand that the case be re-opened.|$|E

50|$|The counter-majoritarian {{difficulty}} (sometimes counter-majoritarian dilemma) is {{a perceived}} problem with {{judicial review of}} legislative (or popularly created) laws.

5000|$|The idea of co-sleeping was not new {{in modern}} Western societies; {{as early as}} in 1976, Tine Thevenin had campaigned for the [...] "family bed".

He doesn't even object {{if a child is}} in the habit of {{literally}} spending the whole night with her mothers nipple in her mouth, except when the mother really feels uncomfortable. Sears advises working mothers to co-sleep on all accounts in order to compensate the child for her daytime absence.|$|E

This became Hamilton's rule: in each behaviour-evoking situation, the individual assesses his neighbour's fitness against his own according to the coefficients of relationship appropriate to the situation.

50|$|According to keyboardist Cris Botarelli, the band's name {{does not}} mean {{anything}} special; it was a mere suggestion of vocalist Emmily Barreto's mother that ended up pleasing the band members after they failed to reach an agreement.

50|$|In 2008, a {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine if there is a significant link between hoarding and interference in occupational and social functioning. Hoarding behavior is often severe because hoarders do not recognize it as a problem. It is much harder for behavioral therapy to successfully treat compulsive hoarders with poor insight about their disorder. Results show that hoarders were significantly less likely to <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> in a hoarding situation than a friend or a relative might. This is independent of OCD symptoms, as people with OCD are often very aware of their disorder. The opposite condition is compulsive decluttering.|$|E
50|$|Deforestation {{is often}} <b>seen</b> as <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> in {{developing}} countries but also occurs in the developed world.
