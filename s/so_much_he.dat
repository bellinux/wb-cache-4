5|$|In late 1933, he was {{employed}} at the Sheba Gold Mine at Baberton. He enjoyed the work <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>he</b> contemplated studying for a mining degree.

Consequently, Pattle changed his mind about engineering and opted to find a career as a pilot.|$|E
5|$|Shadrick {{enrolled}} in Pineville High School in 1947 and received top marks in his classes. During {{his sophomore year}} in 1948, he developed an interest in football and made the school's team, though he was small for his age. The team could not afford uniforms, and Shadrick's father gave him five dollars to buy one, but it was stolen from his locker in October 1948. The incident upset Shadrick <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>he</b> dropped out of school, reportedly refusing to return from that day forward. One month later, {{he and a friend}} enlisted in the U.S. Army. Shadrick's father would later refer to the stolen school uniform as the reason Shadrick enlisted in the military, and said he felt it indirectly caused his son's death.|$|E
5|$|On 22 March 1933 he {{was invited}} for an {{interview}} for a commission in the Air Force in Pretoria. One of 30 applicants vying for three places, he was rejected for lack of flying experience. Determined to rectify this weakness, he went to Johannesburg and began taking flying lessons. To fund his new ambition, {{he worked for a}} mining company, Sheba Gold Mine. He enjoyed the work <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>he</b> considered studying for a degree in mining engineering. His passion for flying subsided, but an impromptu visit by a transport aircraft gave Pattle a close glimpse of it, which rekindled his interest. At around the same time, the Ministry of Defence created the Special Service Battalion to employ South African youth who were struggling to find work because of the Great Depression. He joined up in 1936 hoping it would lead to a career in the Air Force. He undertook basic training and national service on the understanding that he would be given an opportunity to enter the Air Force as an instructor {{at the end of his}} four-year service.|$|E

5|$|The rise {{to power}} of the Nazi Party on 30 January 1933 gave German motor companies, notably Mercedes-Benz and Auto Union, an {{opportunity}} to return to motor racing. Having secured promises of funding shortly after the Nazis' {{rise to power}}, both companies {{spent the better part}} of 1933 developing their racing projects. Alfred Neubauer, the Mercedes racing manager, travelled to the Caracciolas' chalet in Lugano in November with a plan to sign him for the 1934 Grand Prix season if he was fit. Neubauer challenged Caracciola to walk, and although the driver laughed and smiled while he did so Neubauer was not fooled: Caracciola was not yet fit. Nevertheless, he offered him a contract, provided he prove his fitness in testing at the AVUS track early in the next year. Caracciola agreed and went to Stuttgart to sign the contract. The trip wore him out <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>he</b> spent much of his time lying on his hotel bed recuperating.|$|E
5|$|The main {{character}} designer for the game, Tetsuya Nomura, had also worked on both Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. The Tsviets were designed {{with the idea}} of creating a sense of balance for the warriors with which players would already be familiar; primarily Vincent, Cloud Strife and Sephiroth. Nomura initially had doubts when designing Shelke's ordinary clothes {{for the end of the}} game, but he felt it was important for her to appear out of uniform so as to indicate she was truly free from Deepground. The character of G was based on the Japanese singer and actor Gackt, who wrote and performed the two theme songs of the game, and voiced G in the Japanese-language version of the game. Hideki Imaizumi, the producer of Crisis Core, liked the mysterious role of G <b>so</b> <b>much,</b> <b>he</b> decided to expand his character in that game. The character of Lucrecia Crescent, who features briefly in an optional quest in the original game, was redesigned so as to give her a similar appearance to her son, Sephiroth, based on portraits from guidebooks and in fan-art. Reeve Tuesti was also redesigned, as he only appears briefly in the original game as himself rather than through Cait Sith.|$|E

In the 1928 season, his deadliness on sticky wickets was so pronounced he topped the county bowling table with 101 wickets, including 13 against Sussex, and his batting developed <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>he</b> edged past 1000 runs with a best score of 98. In the 1929 season, despite only one five-wicket return, he again managed 100 wickets. He was chosen for a second-string tour of the West Indies but did nothing of note.|$|E
