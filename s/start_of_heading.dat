50|$|An early ISO {{standard}} {{defining a}} Telex-oriented communications protocol that used the non-printable ASCII transmission control characters SOH (<b>Start</b> <b>of</b> <b>Heading),</b> STX (Start of Text), ETX (End of Text), EOT (End of Transmission), ENQ (Enquiry), ACK (Acknowledge), DLE (Data Link Escape), NAK (Negative Acknowledge), SYN (Synchronous Idle), and ETB (End of Transmission Block).|$|E
5000|$|An {{optional}} heading containing control information can precede {{data in a}} frame. The content of the heading is not defined by the protocol but is defined for each specific device. The heading, if present, is preceded by an SOH (<b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>heading)</b> character and followed by an STX (start of text). [...] Text data normally follows the heading, begun by the STX, and terminated by ETX (end of text) or ETB (end transmission block).|$|E
50|$|The <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>heading</b> (SOH) {{character}} was to mark a non-data {{section of a}} data stream—the part of a stream containing addresses and other housekeeping data. The start of text character (STX) {{marked the end of}} the header, and the start of the textual part of a stream. The end of text character (ETX) marked the end of the data of a message. A widely used convention is to make the two characters preceding ETX a checksum or CRC for error-detection purposes. The end of transmission block character (ETB) was used to indicate the end of a block of data, where data was divided into such blocks for transmission purposes.|$|E

40|$|Due to late {{planting}} the panicle initiation, heading and maturity {{of all the}} cultivars were slowed with decreasing air temperature and solar radiation. Nizersail and BR 11 did not complete flower beyond October 01 and September 01 planting, respectively while BR 11 completed flowering in all the planting dates. An average temperature 23. 92, 26. 17 and 21. 31 �C for 10 days after <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>heading</b> was required for Nizersail, BR 11 and BR 22, respectively. Eighty three to 94 % tillers of Nizersail produced fully exserted panicles upto October 01 planting while for BR 11 it was 21 - 92 % upto September 15 planting but in BR 22 it was about 86 - 97 % in all planting dates. Full panicle exsertion of Nizersail sharply increased with increasing temperature sum for 10 days from <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>heading,</b> later slightly decreased but it was sharply increased in BR 11. The BR 22 was less sensitive to temperature. The percent panicle exsertion was highly correlated with temperature sum for 1 - 10 days after <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>heading</b> for Nizersail (r = 0. 87 **) and BR 22 (r = 0. 96 **). In BR 11, it was highly correlated with temperature sum for 1 - 10, 11 - 20, 21 - 30 and 11 - 30, days from <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>heading</b> and the corresponding values were (r = 0. 97 **), (r = 0. 95 **), (r = 0. 81 *), (r = 0. 90 **), respectively...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} trial {{comparing}} N management in two crop systems: winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) living mulch with subclover (Trifolium subterraneum L.) (field 1), and winter wheat pure standing with organic N fertilization (field 2). Subclover {{is supposed to}} fix N 2 and to release {{a part of it}} to wheat plants. Wheat grain yield in field 1 is 2227 kg/ha, in field 2 is 2272 kg/ha, with no statistically-significant difference (95 % level). However, the wheat biomass accumulation at the <b>start</b> <b>of</b> <b>heading</b> in field 1 (2635 kg/ha) is significantly lower than that in field 2 (3100 kg/ha). NPK content in wheat plant tissue is also obviously lower in field 1 than in field 2 during the stem extension stage. Soil soluble N content in field 1 is also lower than that in field 2 in the same period. DRIS (Diagnosis and Recommendation Integrated System method) is applied to illustrate N deficiency in field 1. Although after heading soil N availability in field 1 is higher than that in field 2, final N accumulation in wheat biomass is still 15 % lower than in field 2. Subclover grows slowly during the early spring, while after winter wheat heading, it grows fast from 137. 2 kg/ha dry weight to 508. 7 kg/ha in 15 days. Soil soluble N content in field 1 is also higher than in field 2 during this period. However, when wheat plants start heading, the biomass accumulation is already nearly 90 % of maximum biomass yield. Evidence shows that the effect from sub clover fixed N 2 is lower...|$|E
