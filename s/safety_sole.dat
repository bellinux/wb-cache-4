40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} officer characteristics and racially biased policing. In particular, we explore {{the relationship between the}} officer's race/ethnicity and {{the nature and extent of}} excessive enforcement actions by race. We derive an efficient enforcement action theorem which suggests that if public <b>safety</b> is the <b>sole</b> concern of police agencies, then racially and ethnically biased policing will not be a persistent element of police practice. Alternatively, our political economic model suggests that police apply more severe sanctions against other-group drivers. Our results show that the race and ethnicity of officers have a significant and substantive impact on the intensity of enforcement actions by the Florida Highway Patrol against stopped drivers. ...|$|R
40|$|The Canadian Agricultural Income Stabilization (CAIS) {{program was}} {{approved}} in late 2003. It {{now serves as}} Canada’s <b>sole</b> farm <b>safety</b> net program, having replaced the Net Income Stabilization Account (NISA), Canadian Farm Income Program (CFIP), and provincial companion programs. However, the mechanisms of operation and actual performance of CAIS in providing stability to farm incomes are relatively unknown. In particular, to develop expectations of future farm costs and returns and to determine their support for CAIS as the <b>sole</b> <b>safety</b> net under the federal-provincial Agricultural Policy Framework (APF), farmers and their representatives need a concrete understanding of how CAIS {{can be expected to}} work relative to its predecessors.

50|$|Power systems contain {{protective}} devices to prevent {{injury or damage}} during failures. The quintessential protective device is the fuse. When the current through a fuse exceeds a certain threshold, the fuse element melts, producing an arc across the resulting gap that is then extinguished, interrupting the circuit. Given that fuses can be built as the weak point of a system, fuses are ideal for protecting circuitry from damage. Fuses however have two problems: First, after they have functioned, fuses must be replaced as they cannot be reset. This can prove inconvenient if the fuse is at a remote site or a spare fuse is not on hand. And second, fuses are typically inadequate as the <b>sole</b> <b>safety</b> device in most power systems as they allow current flows well in excess of that that would prove lethal to a human or animal.|$|R
40|$|Sustainability, smartness and <b>safety</b> {{are three}} <b>sole</b> {{components}} of a modern transportation system. The objective {{of this study is}} to introduce a modern transportation system in the light of a 3 ‘S’ approach: sustainable, smart and safe. In particular this paper studies the transportation system of Singapore to address how this system is progressing in this three-pronged approach towards a modern transportation system. While sustainability targets environmental justice and social equity without compromising economical efficiency, smartness incorporates qualities like automated sensing, processing and decision making, and action-taking into the transportation system. Since a system cannot be viable without being safe, the safety of the modern transportation system aims minimizing crash risks of all users including motorists, motorcyclists, pedestrians, and bicyclists. Various policy implications and technology applications inside the transportation system of Singapore are discussed to illustrate a modern transportation system within the framework of the 3 ‘S’ model...|$|R
50|$|The second problem, the {{inadequacy}} of fuses to act as the <b>sole</b> <b>safety</b> device in most power systems, is probably best resolved {{by the use of}} residual current devices (RCDs). In any properly functioning electrical appliance the current flowing into the appliance on the active line should equal the current flowing out of the appliance on the neutral line. A residual current device works by monitoring the active and neutral lines and tripping the active line if it notices a difference. Residual current devices require a separate neutral line for each phase {{and to be able to}} trip within a time frame before harm occurs. This is typically not a problem in most residential applications where standard wiring provides an active and neutral line for each appliance (that's why your power plugs always have at least two tongs) and the voltages are relatively low however these issues do limit the effectiveness of RCDs in other applications such as industry. Even with the installation of an RCD, exposure to electricity can still prove lethal.|$|R
25|$|At {{this time}} {{following}} {{attempts by the}} Lithuanian government to draft yeshiva students into the army, the Lithuanian Hebron Yeshiva (Knesses Yisroel) relocated to Hebron, after consultations between Rabbi Nosson Tzvi Finkel, Yechezkel Sarna and Moshe Mordechai Epstein. and by 1929 had attracted some 265 students from Europe and the United States. The majority of the Jewish population lived {{on the outskirts of}} Hebron along the roads to Be'ersheba and Jerusalem, renting homes owned by Arabs, a number of which were built {{for the express purpose of}} housing Jewish tenants, with a few dozen within the city around the synagogues. During the 1929 Hebron massacre, Arab rioters slaughtered some 64 to 67 Jewish men, women and children and wounded 60, and Jewish homes and synagogues were ransacked; 435 Jews survived by virtue of the shelter and assistance offered them by their Arab neighbours, who hid them. Some Hebron Arabs, including Ahmad Rashid al-Hirbawi, president of Hebron chamber of commerce, supported the return of Jews after the massacre. Two years later, 35 families moved back into the ruins of the Jewish quarter, but on the eve of the Palestinian Arab revolt (April 23, 1936) the British Government decided to move the Jewish community out of Hebron as a precautionary measure to secure its <b>safety.</b> The <b>sole</b> exception was the 8th generation Hebronite Ya'akov ben Shalom Ezra, who processed dairy products in the city, blended in well with its social landscape and resided there under the protection of friends. In November 1947, in anticipation of the UN partition vote, the Ezra family closed its shop and left the city. Yossi Ezra has since tried to regain his family's property through the Israeli courts.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Rubber <b>sole</b> for <b>safety</b> shoes was {{different}} on physical specification with general sole, especially on abrasion resistance and oil resistance. The {{objective of the}} study was to determine the effect of nitril butadiene rubber and pale crepe on physical properties of vulcanized rubber <b>sole</b> for <b>safety</b> shoes. Rubber <b>sole</b> for <b>safety</b> shoes was produced by blending pale crepe and nitril butadiene rubber with ratio of : 50 / 50; 60 / 40; 70 / 30 and 80 / 20 phr, respectively.

5000|$|Due to the MR01 {{not having}} any proper testing time, the [...] was {{essentially}} a test session {{to see where the}} car was. Unlike rivals HRT, the MR01 was able to run both drivers, with Glock managing twelfth in the second Friday practice session. By Saturday, however, the two Marussias fell to their familiar qualifying spots on the back two rows. However, due to the 107% rule both HRTs failed to qualify, and Sergio Pérez was forced down to 22nd position due to a penalty for changing his gearbox, making the MR01's first qualifying record as 20th and 21st. Glock and Pic stayed towards the back in the race, but picked up places as cars either retired or pitted. During the <b>sole</b> <b>safety</b> car period of the race, the MR01 was able to use the reinstated rule that allows lapped cars to un-lap themselves prior to the race restart. Glock finished the race 14th, while Pic was forced to retire five laps from the finish due to falling oil pressure, but was classified in 15th place as he had completed over 90% of the race distance.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} standardised {{mechanical test}} methodologies that measure dynamic {{coefficient of friction}} {{in order to assess}} the risk of a pedestrian slip. Currently, two shoesurface contact test methods are specified in British Standards to assess the risk of pedestrian slips during the heel strike phase. A pendulum test device as specified in BS 7976 - 2 : 2002 is used to determine the slip resistance of surfaces. Another standard, BS EN ISO 13287 : 2007 specifies the test method to assess the slip resistance of conventionally <b>soled</b> <b>safety,</b> protective and occupational footwear. Experiments were conducted on six common household surfaces in water contaminated conditions in compliance with the aforementioned standard procedures. The roughness and stiffness of each surface was also found. The results show no statistically significant linear correlation between the dynamic coefficient of friction found via the two standardised test methods. At low levels of roughness, no statistically significant linear correlations were found between the coefficient of friction found via the two standardised test methods and roughness. For flooring with a compliant layer, the contact conditions of the pendulum test device were found to cause friction losses associated with energy dissipated as the surface deforms and recovers during sliding. Differences in sliding velocity and area of contact were found to influence the measurements given by the two test procedures. The higher velocity pendulum is a more appropriate test device to replicate slip in wet conditions as it predicts the worst case scenario. However, it is likely to give misleading results on deformable surfaces as, on such surfaces, as it is not replicating the loading conditions during a real-life heel strike...|$|R

The Dyaks affirm, {{that when the}} old males are wounded with arrows only, they will occasionally leave the trees and rush raging upon their enemies, whose <b>sole</b> <b>safety</b> lies in instant flight, as they are sure to be killed if caught.* ([Footnote] *Sir James Brooke, {{in a letter to}} Mr. Waterhouse, published in the proceedings of the Zoological Society for 1841, says:--"On the habits of the Orangs, as far as I have been able to observe them, I may remark that they are as dull and slothful as can well be conceived, and on no occasion, when pursuing them, did they move so fast as to preclude my keeping pace with them easily through a moderately clear forest; and even when obstructions below (such as wading up to the neck) allowed them to get away some distance, they were sure to stop and allow me to come up. I never observed the slightest attempt at defence, and the wood which sometimes rattled about our ears was broken by their weight, and not thrown, as some persons represent. If pushed to extremity, however, the 'Pappan' could not be otherwise than formidable, and one unfortunate man, who, with a party, was trying to catch a large one alive, lost two of his fingers, besides being severely bitten on the face, whilst the animal finally beat off his pursuers and escaped." [...] Mr. Wallace, on the other hand, affirms that he has several times observed them throwing down branches when pursued. [...] "It is true he does not throw them 'at' a person, but casts them down vertically; for it is evident that a bough cannot be thrown to any distance from the top of a lofty tree. In one case a female Mias, on a durian tree, kept up for at least ten minutes a continuous shower of branches and of the heavy, spined fruits, as large as 32-pounders, which most effectually kept us clear of the tree she was on. She could be seen breaking them off and throwing them down with every appearance of rage, uttering at intervals a loud pumping grunt, and evidently meaning mischief."--"On the Habits of the Orang-Utan," [...] 'Annals of Nat.

50|$|The Summerhill Borough Volunteer Fire Company #1 was {{chartered}} May 19, 1952. Inaugural officers included President Arthur Apple, Vice President George Bodenschatz, Second Vice President Felix Bopp, Secretary Cecil Bopp, and Treasurer Clement Bodenschatz.The original members saw a need {{to raise}} money to build a station and to purchase equipment and supplies for fire protection. In August 1952, the members started monthly 50-50 ticket sales as a fundraiser.In 1953, the company purchased a lot from Alex Betz for $600 which would be the site of the first Summerhill Borough fire station in 1956. The building still stands today as the Summerhill Borough Municipal Building.The department held its first major fundraiser in 1955 when it chanced off a 1955 Plymouth station wagon. Ticket sales brought in $3,475, a profit of $480.In 1958, after several years of planning, the fire company finally received its first pieces of firefighting equipment, a 1924 American LaFrance pumper from the Wilmore Fire Department, for $350. In addition to the pumper, the Brownstown Fire Department donated a Buick ambulance to the department {{to be used as a}} squad truck. Shortly after this, Summerhill Borough became an active fire department.Before Summerhill had its own fire department, fire protection was provided by the South Fork Volunteer Fire Company at no charge to the residents of Summerhill. In March 1958, the South Fork Fire Company, who also provided fire protection to South Fork Borough and parts of Croyle Township, realized the South Fork taxpayers were assuming too great of a burden in order to service all three of these municipalities. Thus, a new plan was devised for a better method of underwriting operational costs.The plan was based on the assessed valuation of properties at 1.5 mills. Summerhill Borough agreed to pay about $500 per year for fire protection. This agreement lasted only one year. In March 1959, the Summerhill Fire Department notified South Fork Borough council that they would handle their own fire protection and respond to any and all emergencies in Summerhill Borough. In that same year, the department joined the Cambria County Volunteer Firemen’s Association.Over the next few years, the department grew and many changes occurred. Seeing the need for improvements, the department made various equipment purchases. In 1961, the department purchased a 1946 Chevrolet pumper from Paul W. Miller for $4,000. A used siren, a new portable pump, and boots and helmets (which were the closest things to turnout gear then) were all purchased in 1963. Soon thereafter, the department bought a 1952 squad truck from Portage Volunteer Fire Company for $350 to carry personnel and equipment to scenes in a safe manner.Because the department had better vehicles and equipment, the members decided that the station needed attention. The department paid $1,700 to renovate the station in 1965 and held an open house in October of that year to show the community the improvements that were made.Due to the increase of rural fire calls and a poor water system in the borough, the department decided in 1966 to purchase a 1,000-gallon Chevrolet tanker from Wilfred Kibler for $550.Charles Huber relieved Jay Bimle as president in January 1968. In September 1971, the department purchased their first self-contained breathing apparatus. They were made by Survive-Air, and cost the company $352 each. These SCBA allowed the personnel to enter burning buildings and attack the fire from within for extended periods of time, replacing previously-used gas masks.The first milestone for the department came in 1972 when the members agreed to purchase their first new fire engine from Paul Miller Fire Equipment. The cab and chassis was purchased from E.L. Jones Dodge of Summerhill for $6,885. The chassis was shipped to Tipton, Indiana, where the John Bean division of the FMC Company manufactured the body at a cost of $18,742. The engine was put into service in January 1973.The Croyle Township Supervisors awarded the department with a contract in April 1973 to provide fire protection to all of Croyle Township north of Route 53 for $350 per year. This area includes New Germany, Rose Hill, Pringle Hill, and Swigle Mountain Road. The department continues to provide fire protection to these areas today.Another change was brought to the department in 1974. Due to the increasing decline of memberships, the department allowed 16-and-17-year-olds to become junior firefighters. In that same year, the department purchased two additional SCBAs for $620 each, bringing the total SCBAs to four.The company purchased its first radio equipment in 1975. This equipment included a base station from the Westwood Fire Company and three mobile radios from the Dale Fire Company. In that same year, the department purchased a new Chevrolet Suburban for $5,946, which lead to the sale of the 1952 squad truck to the Wilmore Fire Department for $250. The 1975 Suburban served as our rescue truck for 17 years until it was replaced in 1992 by a 1980 GMC/SWAB rescue. It lasted for another six years as our squad truck until finally being sold to a private owner.In February 1976, the company purchased 1000 feet of 4-inch hose, one of the first departments in the county to move to large-diameter hose. This decision was made due to the increasing building construction in our coverage area and it also brought down insurance costs to the residents.After months of planning, in an effort to reduce costs through group purchasing and to reduce the duplication of equipment in the area, the Forest Hills Fire Association was formed in December 1976. The Association members were Dunlo, South Fork, St. Michael, Summerhill Borough, Summerhill Township (Beaverdale), and Wilmore.Major flooding occurred on July 20, 1977, in parts of Cambria County, including Summerhill Borough. At the height of the storm, a pickup truck was washed downstream by the raging flood currents after a bridge washed out. Tom Bodenschatz, without due regard for his own personal <b>safety,</b> rescued the <b>sole</b> occupant of the truck. For his unselfish act, Tom was awarded the only honorary life membership for action from the department. The borough did suffer the loss of one life as a result of the flood.In September 1977, a truck committee was formed to look at and plan for the future purchase of a fire engine. The company didn’t want, or need, to rush into this project, so the committee carefully looked at numerous types of engines from various companies and dealers. In September 1979, the company agreed to purchase a 1980 American LaFrance from William Sprowls at a cost of $89,000.To help defray the cost of the engine, a monthly sub sale was started in August 1979. This sale is still a valuable fundraiser today and continues to be held on the second Saturday of every month.The Sector 8 Air Association was formed to purchase a “regional” air compressor in May 1980. Summerhill Borough, along with Beaverdale, Dunlo, St. Michael, South Fork, and Wilmore Fire Departments formed the association. In later years, the association went on to buy a 6-bottle cascade for the system and, more recently, upgraded to a high-pressure system.Also in 1980, Treasurer Paul Bimle resigned after 29 years of service. Larry Wilburn took over this office and still holds it today.Looking to the future, the department purchased the land adjacent to the fire station in July 1983. This purchase allowed for the planning of a new, larger fire station.In 1984, Summerhill was elected to host the 1986 Cambria County Firemen’s Convention and Charles Huber was elected as Second Vice-President of the association.From July 26 - Aug. 3, 1986, Summerhill hosted the 65th Annual Convention of the Volunteer Firemen’s Association of Cambria County and Vicinity. During the convention, the department appointed new honorary life members. They were Paul Bimle, Ed Bodenschatz, Jack Bodenschatz, Charles Huber, Ed Huber, Vince Kitchick, and Jack Wilburn.In March 1987, the department purchased the first hydraulic rescue system in the Forest Hills area when an AMKUS system was purchased from Kaza Fire Equipment. Prior to this tool being put into service, the area departments had to rely either on the Portage or Dauntless Fire Companies for a hydraulic tool.With a new-found interest in fire fighting once again on the rise in the Forest Hills area, our department, in conjunction with Harrisburg Area Community College and the Cambria County Department of Emergency Services, sponsored an Essentials of Fire Fighting class. Over 25 students participated in this course, with four from our department.A ribbon cutting ceremony was held on May 1, 1994, to open the new fire station. Guests included Cambria County Commissioner Kathy Holtzman and State Representative Ed Haluska. Cub Scout Pack 53 raised the flag at the station for the first time. The cost of construction was nearly $350,000.The Cambria County Firemen’s Convention came back to Summerhill in 1999 when the borough hosted the 78th annual event.Also in 1999, with age again creeping up on our apparatus, another truck committee was formed to start looking into replacing our rescue with a new vehicle. The committee looked at several models and styles, and decided HME would best serve our needs. Bids were sent out for construction. The contract was given to 4-Guys, Inc. of Meyersdale for $250,000. In January 2001, we took delivery of a 16 ft, non walk-in rescue built on an HME 1250 SFO chassis.2002 marked the 50th anniversary of the Summerhill Boro Fire Department. A dinner was held at the Imperial Room in Ebensburg to commemorate the event. All members, both past and present, along with members of the community who routinely help with our events were invited. Guest speakers were Charles Moyer, the Mayor of Ebensburg Boro, and Representative Gary Haluska from Patton. The women’s auxiliary, who has always worked hard to support the fire department, presented us with a gift that we had been working for… a thermal imaging camera. New honorary life members were also presented at the dinner. They were Linda Bodenschatz, Ron Parks and Larry Penatzer.The morning of Monday, February 9, 2004, brought tragedy to the department with the death of Charles Huber. Charlie was starting his 36th year as president of the department and died in the Summerhill home he grew up in. Greg Madison was elected president - only the fourth president in the department’s 52-year history.New leadership came to the department in January 2005 when Dan Penatzer was elected our fifth president. Greg Madison was retained as the vice president.The Assistance to Firefighters Federal Grant Program awarded the department a grant for $251,750 in August 2005. In late September, the truck committee started plans to replace the 1973 Dodge John Bean pumper.Tragedy struck the department again on October 23, 2005, when former assistant chief and life member Robert “Newt” Gallardy was injured in a training class at the Pennsylvania State Fire Academy in Lewistown. Bob was an instructor in a live burn session when, for an unknown reason, he failed to exit the building. Students found him unconscious on the basement floor. Bob suffered third-degree burns over most of his body and died two days later from his injuries. Bob was a volunteer firefighter with our department from 1975 until 1996 when he was hired by the Altoona City Fire Department, where he had been recently promoted to captain. Bob leaves behind his wife Vicki and sons Drew, Kyle and Derrek.After advertising for bids in August 2006, our department entered into an agreement with Nollie W. Neill Jr of Ennice, NC, to sell him the 1973 Dodge pumper for $5,000. Neill is a collector of Dodge fire trucks, and plans to refurbish it and take it to fire truck shows. Bright-and-early on the morning of Oct. 9, Neill arrived at the station to do the paperwork and drive the Dodge back to North Carolina. By 7:00 pm that evening the 73 Dodge Pumper was in Hillsville Virginia for a Fire Prevention Parade, the first of 3 Fire Prevention parades, it did that first week with its new owner.Our department took delivery of a 2006 HME engine on Oct. 13, 2006. The engine has an eight-man cab, 750-gallon tank, and 2000 gpm pump. The engine was placed into service in mid-November in a limited capacity until all its equipment could be purchased and installed.The Assistance to Firefighters Federal Grant Program awarded our department another grant in November 2006, this time for $50,799. This money was put toward equipment for the new engine and updating equipment on the 1980 American LaFrance.In October 2007, through a cooperative effort of Croyle Township, Summerhill Township, New Germany Wood Products and Pat Dumm, a dry hydrant was installed in Dumm’s pond located next to New Germany Wood Products, thus greatly increasing fire protection in New Germany. An access road was created from the business’s parking lot.Also during October 2007, we received a FEMA grant for $89,915. In an effort to complement our existing hydraulic rescue tools, the department purchased a Genesis C-165 cutter for $5,400 from Howell Rescue Systems and an AMKUS 24-inch spreader. We also replaced the arms on our current AMKUS spreader, purchased removable and extended reach tips, and quick chain adjusters. Also purchased were 20 new sets of turnout gear, 29 pairs of gloves, two sets of auto cribbing, accountability tags, 14 flashlights, eight SCBA with spare bottles, and traffic control equipment.After several months of planning, the department ordered a 2008 Ford F-350 pickup truck from Day Chevrolet in Monroeville in December 2007. Keith’s Truck Service in Hollidaysburg then built the body for what would become Utility 864.Charter member Edward “A” Bodenschatz died on April 3, 2008, at Lauralwood Care Center. “A” was a past fire chief, serving in 1972.Utility 864 was placed into service on July 30, 2008. That weekend, it won “Best Appearing Utility/Support Vehicle” at the Cambria County Firemen’s Convention Parade in Clymer. The Summerhill Borough Fire Department currently offers fire protection to the residents of Summerhill and Wilmore Boroughs as well as to portions of Croyle Township, including the New Germany Area. The department operates out of one station, which houses two engines, one heavy rescue truck, and one utility vehicle.|$|R
