5|$|On the {{following}} day, Medvedev ordered Russia's government agency devoted to consumer protection, Rospotrebnadzor, to ban all sales of non-food items {{with more than}} 25 percent alcohol. Their order came into effect on 26 December and was scheduled to run for one month before being extended for a further 60 days in January; the restrictions did not cover perfumes and glass-cleaning products. Further restrictions were possibly considered, with one top health official announcing that a <b>state</b> <b>monopoly</b> may be imposed on Russia's perfume and pharmaceutical industries.|$|E
5|$|This {{restriction}} {{and kind}} of <b>state</b> <b>monopoly</b> {{on the use of}} national symbols during the Communist regime made flying the Polish flag a symbol of resistance against the government. It became customary – and still is – for workers to hoist Polish flags on plant buildings when going on strike. This is why the Polish flag, as a symbol of patriotism and resistance against the Communist rule, is part of the Solidarity trade union logo.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} prices charged {{and the quality}} of service {{provided}} by <b>state</b> <b>monopolies</b> and private insurance companies on the property insurance market. Both the cross-section data from Switzerland and the time-series evidence from Germany strongly suggest that in this specific market the presence of <b>state</b> <b>monopolies</b> is very advantageous for the customers. This raises the question why German academic economists made practically no effort to defend their <b>state</b> insurance <b>monopolies</b> in the debate about the 3 rd EU directive on property insurance. Is it possible that peer pressure prevents academic economists from standing up to defend <b>state</b> <b>monopolies,</b> even if these are clearly to the benefit of consumers...|$|R

5|$|During {{the late}} 1820s, Heliade became {{involved}} in cultural policies. In 1827, he and Dinicu Golescu founded Soţietatea literară românească (the Romanian Literary Society), which, through its program (mapped out by Heliade himself), proposed Saint Sava's transformation into a college, the opening of another such institution in Craiova, {{and the creation of}} schools in virtually all Wallachian localities. In addition, Soţietatea attempted to encourage the establishment of Romanian-language newspapers, calling {{for an end to the}} <b>state</b> <b>monopoly</b> on printing presses. The grouping, headquartered on central Bucharest's Podul Mogoşoaiei, benefited from Golescu's experience abroad, and was soon joined by two future Princes, Gheorghe Bibescu and Barbu Dimitrie Ştirbei. Its character was based on Freemasonry; around that time, Heliade is known to have become a Freemason, as did a large section of his generation.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Gaddafi's {{government}} {{declared a}} <b>state</b> <b>monopoly</b> on foreign trade. Its increasingly radical reforms, {{coupled with the}} large amount of oil revenue being spent on foreign causes, generated discontent in Libya, particularly among the country's merchant class. In 1974, Libya saw its first civilian attack on Gaddafi's government when a Benghazi army building was bombed. Much of the opposition centred around the RCC member Omar Mehishi, and with fellow RCC member Bashir Saghir al-Hawaadi he began plotting a coup against Gaddafi. In 1975 their plot was exposed and the pair fled into exile, receiving asylum from Sadat's Egypt. In the aftermath only five RCC members remained, and power was further concentrated in Gaddafi's hands. This led to the RCC's official abolition in March 1977.|$|E
5|$|In his {{theoretical}} writings, particularly Imperialism, Lenin discussed what {{he regarded}} as developments in capitalism since Marx's death; in his view, it {{had reached a}} new stage, <b>state</b> <b>monopoly</b> capitalism. He also believed that although Russia's economy was dominated by the peasantry, that monopoly capitalism existed in Russia meant {{that the country was}} sufficiently materially developed to move to socialism. Leninism adopted a more absolutist and doctrinaire perspective than other variants of Marxism, and distinguished itself by the emotional intensity of its liberationist vision. It also stood out by emphasising the role of a vanguard who could lead the proletariat to revolution, and elevated the role of violence as a revolutionary instrument.|$|E

5|$|In November 1917, Lenin {{issued the}} Decree on Workers' Control, which {{called on the}} workers of each {{enterprise}} to establish an elected committee to monitor their enterprise's management. That month they also issued an order requisitioning the country's gold, and nationalised the banks, which Lenin saw as a major step toward socialism. In December, Sovnarkom established a Supreme Council of the National Economy (VSNKh), which had authority over industry, banking, agriculture, and trade. The factory committees were subordinate to the trade unions, which were subordinate to VSNKh; thus, the state's centralised economic plan was prioritised over the workers' local economic interests. In early 1918, Sovnarkom cancelled all foreign debts and refused to pay interest owed on them. In April 1918, it nationalised foreign trade, establishing a <b>state</b> <b>monopoly</b> on imports and exports. In June 1918, it decreed nationalisation of public utilities, railways, engineering, textiles, metallurgy, and mining, although often these were state-owned in name only. Full-scale nationalisation {{did not take place}} until November 1920, when small-scale industrial enterprises were brought under state control.|$|E

40|$|The article {{analyzes}} {{the causes of}} the incoherent reformprogram in Russia in the last decade. It argues that the slow and partial policies can be attributed to a viscous combination of lobbyism and constitutional design. Because the post-communist transitions after 1989 were non violent “velvet revolutions,” the old <b>state</b> <b>monopolies</b> were not removed. <b>State</b> <b>monopolies</b> have small-group advantages in contrast to the large group of private firms, which are numerous and not yet organized. It leads to an asymmetrical pattern of lobbyism in favor of non-transition, which can only be mitigated by establishing dispersed political institutions, that can raise the price on rent-seeking. In Russia the centralized political institutions of the past were not replaced. Hence, Russia inherited both interest groups and political institutions of the late communist era – an unfortunate starting point for carrying out comprehensive economic reforms. Free trade with the West and potential competition may put pressure on the old <b>state</b> <b>monopolies.</b> However, lobbies in the European Union may oppose free trade to maintain their monopoly. ...|$|R

25|$|This {{was also}} a period when the Italian Fascist {{government}} undertook a large-scale privatization policy, which {{was among the first}} such policies in the modern world. Fascist Italy was the only country that sold state-owned enterprises and assets to private firms in the 1920s; the next country to adopt this approach was Nazi Germany in the 1930s. The Italian privatizations included the sale of most state-owned telephone networks and services, as well as the former <b>state</b> <b>monopoly</b> on match sale. The <b>state</b> <b>monopoly</b> on life insurance was eliminated, the metal machinery firm Ansaldo was returned to private ownership (after having been nationalized by the previous government), and private firms were awarded concessions to set up tolls on motorways.|$|E
25|$|The {{structural}} reform process {{that started in}} 1992 unbundled the vertically integrated <b>state</b> <b>monopoly</b> {{and led to the}} privatization of the electricity sector. Today, private companies dominate the generation sector with almost 70% of capacity in their hands. Although there are about 40 companies that generate electricity for the market, just 4 of them (EDEGEL S.A.A., Electroperú S.A., Energía del Sur S.A. and EGENOR) account for 70% of the total capacity.|$|E
25|$|Before 1949, peasants had farmed {{their own}} small pockets of land, and {{observed}} traditional practices—festivals, banquets, and paying homage to ancestors. It was realized that Mao's policy {{of using a}} <b>state</b> <b>monopoly</b> on agriculture to finance industrialization would be unpopular with the peasants. Therefore, it was proposed that the peasants should be brought under Party control by the establishment of agricultural collectives which would also facilitate the sharing of tools and draft animals.|$|E

The move, in effect, should have ended all kinds of State (read forest department) <b>monopoly.</b> However, <b>State</b> <b>monopolies</b> still persist in Minor Forest Produce, especially in lucrative MFP like Bamboo and Tendu. It is interesting to observe here that the Forest Rights Act, 2006 also defines a central role to the Gram Sabha in the management of minor forest produce. Evidently, any <b>state</b> <b>monopolies,</b> in this context, are patently illegal.|$|R

25|$|Until {{the early}} 1990s, the {{electricity}} sector in Nicaragua {{was characterized by}} the presence of the State, through the Nicaraguan Energy Institute (INE), in all its activities.

Then it set up the Mining Corporation of Bolivia (Corporación Minera de Bolivia, Comibol) as a semi-autonomous enterprise to run state-owned mines.

The key objectives of the law were the creation of the CNPE and the ANP, increased use of natural gas, increased competition in the energy market, and investments in power generation. The <b>state</b> <b>monopoly</b> of oil and gas exploration was ended, and energy subsidies were reduced. However, the government retained monopoly control of key energy complexes and administered the price of certain energy products.|$|E

French television was partly liberalised {{in the next two}} decade with the creation of several commercial channels, mainly thanks to cable and satellite television.

Hogg and his attorney-general argued that the companies were engaged in rebates, price fixing, consolidation, and other tactics prohibited by the state's 1889 antitrust act. The investigation resulted in a number of indictments, including one for Rockefeller. Hogg requested that Rockefeller be extradited from New York, but the New York governor refused, as Rockefeller had not fled from Texas. Rockefeller was never tried, but other employees of the company were found guilty.|$|E
