50|$|Differential heat {{treatment}} (also called selective {{heat treatment}} or local heat treatment) {{is a technique}} used during heat treating to harden or soften certain areas of a <b>steel</b> <b>object,</b> creating a difference in hardness between these areas. There are many techniques for creating a difference in properties, but most {{can be defined as}} either differential hardening or differential tempering. These were common heat treating techniques used historically in Europe and Asia, with possibly the most widely known example being from Japanese swordsmithing. Some modern varieties were developed in the twentieth century as metallurgical knowledge and technology rapidly increased.|$|R
50|$|A rare but notable gamma {{source is}} sodium-24, {{this has a}} very short {{half-life}} but it emits photons with very high energies (>2 MeV).

In common with Co-60 and Ir-192 it is formed by the neutron activation of the commonly found stable isotope.|$|E
5000|$|Rustproofing is the {{prevention}} or delay of rusting {{of iron and}} <b>steel</b> <b>objects,</b> or the permanent [...] against corrosion. Typically, the protection is achieved by a process of surface finishing or treatment. Depending on mechanical wear or environmental conditions, the degradation may not be stopped completely, unless the process is periodically repeated. The term is particularly used in the automobile industry.|$|E
50|$|Historically, objects {{made from}} iron or steel were created for religious, artistic, technical, {{military}} and domestic uses. The act of conservation and restoration strives {{to prevent and}} slow {{the deterioration of the}} object as well as protecting the object for future use. The prevention and removal of surface dirt and corrosion products are the primary concerns of conservator-restorers when dealing with iron or <b>steel</b> <b>objects,</b> including nickel-iron meteorites.|$|E

It {{is most often}} used to influence others, to mentally suggest or trick, to tame or calm. It {{can be used to}} accelerate healing, and dispel the effects of alcohol and drugs. Many times, armor or other implements are charmed by the use of symbols and spells to enhance their effectiveness.|$|E
50|$|Thick {{forests of}} trees over 90 feet tall {{completely}} cover {{the eastern half}} of North America. Human structures still survive under forest humus.

The Great Sphinx of Giza is buried again in the sands of the Sahara to survive for thousands of years in preservation.|$|E
50|$|Electrolysis is {{also used}} in the {{cleaning}} and preservation of old artifacts. Because the process separates the non-metallic particles from the metallic ones, it is very useful for cleaning {{a wide variety of}} metallic objects, from old coins to even larger objects including rusted cast iron cylinder blocks and heads when rebuilding automobile engines. Rust removal from small iron or <b>steel</b> <b>objects</b> by electrolysis can be done in a home workshop using simple materials such as a plastic bucket, tap water, lengths of rebar, washing soda, baling wire, and a battery charger.|$|E
5000|$|Differential heat {{treatment}} {{is a method}} used to alter the properties of various parts of a <b>steel</b> <b>object</b> differently, producing areas that are harder or softer than others. This creates greater toughness in {{the parts of the}} object where it is needed, such as the tang or spine of a sword, but produces greater hardness at the edge or other areas where greater impact resistance, wear resistance, and strength is needed. Differential {{heat treatment}} can often make certain areas harder than could be allowed if the steel was uniformly treated, or [...] "through treated". There are several techniques used to differentially heat treat steel, but they can usually be divided into differential hardening and differential tempering methods.|$|R
5000|$|The DSSS is {{a yellow}} <b>steel</b> <b>object</b> {{that has been}} placed next to the wrecked reactor; it is 63 meters (207 ft) tall and has a series of {{cantilevers}} that extend through the western buttress wall, and is intended to stabilize the sarcophagus. This was done because if {{the wall of the}} reactor building or the roof of the shelter were to collapse, then large amounts of radioactive dust and particles would be released directly into the atmosphere, resulting in a large new release of radioactivity into the environment. In December 2006 the [...] "Designed Stabilisation Steel Structure" [...] (DSSS) was extended until 50% of the roof load (about 400 tons) was transferred from the axis 50 wall to the DSSS.|$|R

30|$|Steel {{manufacturing}} is a batch process. For example, during rolling of a slab {{into hot}} strip, total rolling process through multiple rolling stands, accelerated cooling and coiling {{are to be}} completed irrespective of whether there is any defect present in the strip or not. Defect detection and classification algorithm processing time can broadly be divided in two parts: a) time taken by the system from capturing an image to identification of RoI and b) feature extraction and classification of defect type from identified RoI. The first part {{is considered to be}} a ‘Real-time’ process meaning that for each image, this part of the processing must be completed within a stipulated time depending on the maximum speed at which the <b>steel</b> <b>object</b> can travel. Once RoIs are identified, second part of processing for the whole batch is required to be completed within the stipulated batch process completion time. Thus, the second part of the algorithm processing time is considered to be ‘Just in time’ process [57].|$|R
50|$|British {{business}} interests were split on colonial iron: manufacturers appreciated the lower prices due to colonial imports, but the British iron and <b>steel</b> industry <b>objected</b> to the competition.
