5000|$|<b>Specific</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>action</b> (SDA), {{also known}} as Thermic effect of food (TEF) or dietary induced {{thermogenesis}} (DIT), {{is the amount of}} energy expenditure above the resting metabolic rate due to the cost of processing food for use and storage. [...] Heat production by brown adipose tissue which is activated after consumption of a meal is an additional component of dietary induced thermogenesis. [...] The thermic effect of food is one of the components of metabolism along with resting metabolic rate and the exercise component. A commonly used estimate of the thermic effect of food is about 10% of one's caloric intake, though the effect varies substantially for different food components. For example, dietary fat is very easy to process and has very little thermic effect, while protein is hard to process and has a much larger thermic effect.|$|E

40|$|The feeding {{energetics}} of the Antarctic spiny plunderfish (Harpagifer antarcticus) {{were examined}} {{with respect to}} the effect of both ration size and animal size. Fish of different sizes were fed single meals at one of two ration levels (2. 5 % wet body mass and satiation) to determine the maximum aerobic scope that could be elicited by the <b>specific</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>action.</b> The excretion rates of ammonia, urea, and fluorescamine-positive substances were also monitored. Neither fish size nor ration had any effect on the factorial aerobic scope of feeding, which suggests that cellular metabolic processes associated with feeding were satiated by relatively small meals. The factorial scope in ammonia excretion was affected by both ration and fish size, indicating that respiration and excretion respond to a meal independently. The duration of the <b>specific</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>action</b> response (240 - 390 h) increased with fish size but not ration, whereas both the time to reach the peak oxygen consumption and the duration of the ammonia response increased with ration but not fish size. The percentage of the ingested energy that was expended following feeding (the <b>specific</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>action</b> coefficient) was high at low rations (approximately 56 %) but lower (roughly 10 %) at satiation rations. This is because the absolute energetic cost of processing a meal was largely independent of meal size. The change in O:N ratios after feeding was very ration-dependent; at low rations, O:N ratios increased, whereas at satiation rations, the O:N ratios decreased...|$|E
40|$|The {{field of}} {{application}} of unreinforced load-bearing masonry has been widely extended {{in the past two}} decades thanks to a better understanding of the structural behaviour and a better control of production methods, leading to improvements of their design and a more rational use of the material. Multi-storey apartment buildings and lightweight concrete houses are now widespread. Nevertheless, this structural solution is still questionable in seismic areas, even for low-to-moderate activity, and requires additional investigations to properly understand the structural behaviour under these <b>specific</b> horizontal <b>dynamic</b> <b>actions.</b> Moreover, these new applications are associated to new requirements, like the individual comfort or the low energy-consumption, achieved by resorting to technical solutions that are likely to influence on the dynamic response of the structure. In this context, experimental shake table tests have been performed on unreinforced loadbearing clay masonry sub-structures. In this paper, the main observations derived from the direct experimental measurements are summarized and followed by resulting preliminary conclusions. A major observation is a significant rocking behaviour for the tests with the highest seismic input, strongly influenced by the presence of rubber devices and the frame effect. Dynamic characterization of the tested specimens (natural frequencies and modal shapes) is also detailed. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Th'at a {{departure}} from the usual in metabolism, either qualitative or quantitative must exist in obesity seems self evident. In many instances, of course, the direction of this departure is plain and lies in a food intake obviously excessive. In other cases the nature of the metabolic fault is obscure. Aside from excessive food intake, the fundamental cause of obesity conceivably may lie in a depressed rate of basal metabolism or in a lowered metabolic response to any of the calorigenetic stimuli that affect the human body. Studies of the basal metabolic rate in obesity have been made in this laboratory and several reports published (19. No consistent variation from normal has been found. Confirmatory evidence has been reported by Boothby and Sandiford from the Mayo Clinic (2). More recently Strouse and his co-workers have made studies in the <b>specific</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>action</b> of various food substances and find that the <b>specific</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>action</b> of protein is lowered in the so-called constitutional obesity (3). A similar finding has been reported by Plaut (4), but denied by Lauter (5), who states that "in the varied types of obesity, the <b>specific</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>action</b> of protein often gave very high values and on the whole they were not lowered. " He as-cribes the origin of obesity to the food intake which is more than suffi-cient for the energy needs and a deposition of fat then results. It is well known that thin persons are often nervous and emotional, and fat ' ones seldom so. For this reason, in the further search for a metabolic fault, it seemed advisable to study the physiological meta-bolic response to emotion in the obese.

Combined feeding and byssus attachment led to a still higher metabolic rate (34. 0 ± 1. 23 μg O(2) h(- 1) g(- 1)). Behavior was also significantly altered, with mussels being almost continuously open during attachment and after feeding (90 %- 99 % of the time); however, the time spent open during the day decreased, reaching a minimum of 52 % ± 9 % 3 days after feeding, and remained low (67 %- 82 %) for the following 45 -day starvation period.

The present study assessed (i) the contribution of sleep, circadian cycle and the <b>specific</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>action</b> effect of the evening meal, to the fall in metabolic rate during the sleep period. (ii) the effects of sleep stage on oxygen consumption which had been suggested by previous researchers, and (iii) the effect of body movement arousals on oxygen consumption. Five subjects were tested {{for a total of}} nine nights under three conditions in a repeated measures design. Subjects were confined to bed throughout their usual sleep period, but were allowed to go to sleep 0, 3 or 6 hours following their usual time for lights out. Oxygen consumption was measured in all conditions for the half hour before and after each of the times for lights out and then throughout the sleep period following lights out. The results demonstrated that changes in energy expenditure during the sleep period are a function of both sleep and circadian cycle. In this study the contribution of the components was approximately equal. However, the effect of sleep was rapid, with oxygen consumption values reaching an asymptote within fifteeen minutes of sleep onset, while the effect of circadian cycle was constant over the assessment period. No evidence was found implicating the <b>specific</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>action</b> effect of the evening meal in the reduction in sleep period metabolic rate. The results of previous studies can be interpreted as being due to the combined effect of circadian and sleep influences, and not to specific differences in metabolic rate between separate sleep stages.
