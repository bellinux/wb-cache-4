25|$|People {{possess an}} {{inherent}} ensemble of basic beliefs about themselves, others, the world, etc. Such “naïve theories” are what compose our symbolic universe. One’s symbolic universe {{is part of}} a <b>socially</b> <b>shared</b> knowledge, transmitted principally as a result of education and social communication, with a large emphasis on the process of attachment through which parents impart their visions of the world, their symbolic universes, to their children. Such symbolic universes guide how we make sense of the world, and are composed of a relatively stable network of ideologies. Therefore, if one of these beliefs is compromised, the stability of the entire network could be jeopardized. It is very important for people to maintain a sense of stability within such a system of beliefs, so they have a natural psychological motivation to try to protect these beliefs. Because such beliefs have a fundamentally social origin, their revalidation can only be legitimized through a social consensus. Along these lines, aforementioned social rituals came {{to be used as a}} more structured way of re-substantiating beliefs that have been invalidated as a result of an emotional event.|$|E

25|$|In the {{simplest}} terms, collective memory {{can be understood}} as the memory of a group of people, and is usually associated with the passing of that memory from generation to generation. However, there are many nuances to this idea; it must also be considered in terms of the processes of remembering and forgetting events. Thus, when a typical emotional event is <b>socially</b> <b>shared</b> and propagates to perhaps 50 other people, that event becomes a collective memory for that group or community of people. When the emotional event is particularly intense, the event would be expected to undergo an even larger diffusion. Furthermore, the more intense the emotional event is, the more rapid the diffusion should be and should reach more people in a shorter amount of time. This is especially true for events that are shared via mass media, such as newspapers, magazines, television, internet, etc. In this case, the collective memory is no longer confined to a local population, but instead can become that of a regional, national, or even international population. Besides the propagation of a single person’s emotional event, many people can simultaneously experience a single national emotional event, such as the disappearing of an important person. Such an event also becomes part of a collectively shared memory. However, {{it must be noted that}} each person still has their own personal memory of the event, such as where they were when they experienced the event, what they were doing, etc.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are certain}} {{characteristics}} of adolescent development {{that are more}} rooted in culture than in human biology or cognitive structures. Culture {{has been defined as}} the [...] "symbolic and behavioral inheritance received from the past that provides a community framework for what is valued". [...] Culture is learned and <b>socially</b> <b>shared,</b> and it affects all aspects of an individual's life. [...] Social responsibilities, sexual expression, and belief system development, for instance, are all things that are likely to vary by culture. Furthermore, distinguishing characteristics of youth, including dress, music and other uses of media, employment, art, food and beverage choices, recreation, and language, all constitute a youth culture. [...] For these reasons, culture is a prevalent and powerful presence in the lives of adolescents, and therefore we cannot fully understand today's adolescents without studying and understanding their culture. However, [...] "culture" [...] should not be seen as synonymous with nation or ethnicity. Many cultures are present within any given country and racial or socioeconomic group. Furthermore, to avoid ethnocentrism, researchers must be careful not to define the culture's role in adolescence in terms of their own cultural beliefs.|$|E
40|$|Data {{showed that}} {{emotional}} episodes nearly universally elicit {{a need to}} talk about it with other people in an interpersonal process which has been called "the social sharing of emotion. A very common {{answer to the question of}} the motives underlying this need to <b>socially</b> <b>share</b> emotional experiences advocates cathartic effects of the verbal expression of emotion. Lay persons as well as professionals very generally considered that once an emotion is shared, it vanishes. The resulting feeling of relief would motivate people to <b>socially</b> <b>share</b> future emotional experiences. A parallel reasoning is held for emotional expression in collective situations, as happen in commemorations, celebrations, religious ceremonies and other social rituals. It is also predicted that participants in a process of collective emotional expression would experience feelings of relief and an alleviation of the load of the commemorated emotion. The studies to be described in this talk examined whether the prediction that the mere expression of an emotion brings emotional recovery. Both in person to person situations and in situations of collective emotional expression, the cathartic hypothesis was not supported. Yet, very generally, participants in social sharing situations reported important social benefits from their participation. The question of the source of these benefits was then investigated. In addition, we examined under what condition sharing an emotion would bring actual recovery...|$|R

40|$|Humans have {{a strong}} {{tendency}} to affiliate with other people, especially in emotional situations. Here, we suggest that a critical mechanism underlying this tendency is that <b>socially</b> <b>sharing</b> emotional experiences is in itself perceived as hedonically positive and thereby contributes to the regulation of individual emotions. We investigated the effect of social sharing of emotions on subjective feelings and neural activity by having pairs of friends view emotional (negative and positive) and neutral pictures either alone or with the friend. While the two friends remained physically separated throughout the experiment—with one undergoing {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} and the other performing the task in an adjacent room—they were made aware on a trial-by-trial basis whether they were seeing pictures simultaneously with their friend (shared) or alone (unshared). Ratings of subjective feelings were improved significantly when participants viewed emotional pictures together than alone, an effect that was accompanied by activity increase in ventral striatum and medial orbitofrontal cortex, two important components of the reward circuitry. Because these effects occurred without any communication or interaction between the friends, they point to an important proximate explanation for the basic human motivation to affiliate with others, particularly in emotional situation...|$|R

40|$|People often <b>socially</b> <b>share</b> their {{emotions}} to regulate them. Two-mode theory of social sharing states that cognitive sharing {{will contribute to}} emotional recovery, whereas socio-affective sharing will only temporarily alleviate emotional distress. Previous studies supporting this theory, measured emotional recovery in terms of residual emotional intensity. Until now, another important time-dynamic aspect of emotions, emotion duration, has been largely ignored. In two experience sampling studies we addressed this gap. In Study 1, participants reported on the duration of anger, fear, and sadness episodes; additionally time-varying information on the occurrence and mode of sharing was collected. This study revealed that sharing led to a shortening in emotion duration, in particular when it was socio-affective in nature. In Study 2 we investigated whether this result could be interpreted {{in terms of our}} measure of duration primarily reflecting emotional relief rather than recovery. In this study, the same method as in Study 1 was used; additionally, residual emotional intensity was measured three days after emotion onset. Study 2 largely replicated the findings from Study 1. Furthermore, duration appeared to be empirically distinct from residual intensity. Finally, no relation between sharing and residual intensity was found, even when considering the sharing mode. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|R

40|$|Mobile device {{users can}} now easily capture and <b>socially</b> <b>share</b> video clips {{in a timely}} manner by {{uploading}} them wirelessly to a server. When attending crowded events, such as an exhibition or the Olympic Games, however, timely sharing of videos becomes difficult due to choking bandwidth in the network infrastructure, preventing like-minded attendees from easily sharing videos with each other through a server. One solution to alleviate this problem is to use direct device-to-device communication to share videos among nearby attendees. Contact capacity between two devices, however, is limited, and thus a recommendation algorithm, such as collaborative filtering, is needed to select and transmit only videos of potential interest to an attendee. In this paper, we address the question: which video clip should be transmitted to which user. We proposed an video transmission scheduling algorithm, called CoFiGel, that runs in a distributed manner and aims to improve both the prediction coverage and precision of the collaborative filtering algorithm. At each device, CoFiGel transmits the video that would increase the estimated number of positive user-video ratings the most if this video is transferred to the destination device. We evaluated CoFiGel using real-world traces and show that substantial improvement can be achieved compared to baseline schemes that do not consider rating or contact history...|$|R
