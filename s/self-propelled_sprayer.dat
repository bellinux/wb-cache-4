Here we present {{the results obtained on}} processingtomato crops using a sprayer boom with and without nozzle control integrated with an RTK (Real Time Kinematic) automatic guidance system. The trials were carried out on tomato crops cultivated in fields of different shapes in a farm located in the Po’ Valley (Piacenza), using a <b>self-propelled</b> <b>sprayer</b> with a capacity of 1000 L and a 14 m opening boom, with a three-channel direct injection distribution system. The <b>self-propelled</b> <b>sprayer</b> was equipped with an automatic guidance system and integrated nozzle control on each boom section. Several parameters were recorded including the speed (km/h) and treated surface (ha). The analysis of the data collected shows an average overlap reduction of 15 % compared to conventional guidance, a value that increases with the irregularity of the field. This technology can improve the environmental sustainability of agrochemical distribution due to the reduction in the consumption of pesticides and can improve the overall welfare of the operator as well...|$|E

The aim of the study was to determine the relationship between the degree of coverage of sprayed surfaces and the deposition of liquid in the aspect of the parametric characteristics of the protected plant using selected single and double stream nozzles. Experiments were conducted under laboratory conditions. The carrier of nozzles acted as an independent <b>self-propelled</b> <b>sprayer</b> used for spraying, whereas the parametric characteristics of plants were determined using artificial plants as the ratio of the vertical projection surface and the horizontal projection surface.

This study aimed to evaluate the droplet spectrum, the deposition and uniformity of spray distribution with different spraying systems and traveling speeds of a <b>self-propelled</b> <b>sprayer</b> in two phenological stages of the cotton plant (B 9 and F 13). The experimental design was randomized blocks and treatments were three spraying techniques: common flat spray tips; tilted flat jet with air induction, at 120 L ha- 1; and rotary atomizer disk, 20 L ha- 1, combined with four traveling speeds: 12, 15, 18 and 25 km h- 1, with four replications. Spraying deposition was evaluated for both leaf surfaces from the cotton plant apex and base (stage B 9) and middle part of the plant (stage F 13) with a cupric marker. A laser particle analyzer also assessed the droplet spectrum. The centrifugal power spray system produces more homogeneous droplet spectrum and increased penetration of droplets into the canopy in both phenological stages.

40|$|Protected {{horticulture}} production {{represents one}} of the most important agricultural businesses in Southern Europe. However, many problems related to the lack of mechanisation, intensive use of pesticides, and, in some cases, undesirable residues on food, have not been solved yet. In this context, application technology is a key factor for the improvement of the efficacy and efficiency of plant protection products. Spray guns and knapsack sprayers are the most common technologies that have been used for this purpose. However, several studies have demonstrated that, compared with spray guns, the use of vertical boom sprayers in greenhouses improves spray distribution and reduces labour costs and operator exposure. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of air-assistance on spray application in conventional tomato greenhouses. For this purpose three different spray conceptions were evaluated; 1) a modified commercial handheld trolley sprayer with two air assistance concepts; 2) a self-propelled sprayer; and 3) an autonomous <b>self-propelled</b> <b>sprayer</b> with remote control. All the sprayers considered were evaluated in terms of absolute and normalised canopy deposition, uniformity of distribution, and losses to the ground. In addition, the vertical liquid and air velocity distributions of the sprayers were assessed and compared with the canopy profiles and spray depositions. Yellow tartrazine (E- 102 yellow) was used as a tracer for deposition evaluation. The results indicated that increasing the air velocity does not increase the efficiency of a spray application. In general, the modified handheld trolley sprayer showed the best results in terms of deposition and uniformity of distribution, especially at the lowest air assistance rate. These results were confirmed with evaluation of the uniformity of the air and liquid distribution. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Postprint (published version...|$|E

40|$|The {{adoption}} of automatic section control (ASC) on agricultural sprayers remains popular since it reduces overlap and application in unwanted areas leading to input savings and improved environmental stewardship.

Therefore, field experiments were conducted using two common <b>self-propelled</b> <b>sprayers</b> equipped with commercially available control systems with ASC capabilities. Pressure transducers were mounted across the spray booms to record real-time nozzle pressure with data tagged with GPS location and time.

40|$|Background: The <b>Self-propelled</b> HighClearanceBoom <b>Sprayer</b> {{is a kind}} of {{important}} paddy field management machinery, the realization of automatic navigation control is of great significance to improve the work efficiency and reduce the injury to the driver. Because of variable load in spray operation and sideslip in paddy field, navigation control is seriously disturbed, the path tracking accuracy is low and the stability is poor. Methods: A path tracking controller was designed based on the pole assignment method. A self-tuning pole assignment algorithm was proposed based on the step response characteristics of two order navigation system. The self-tuning controller could automatically adjust the dynamic characteristics of the system according to the current lateral tracking error and keep good dynamic performance to suppress the interference of the sideslip objective and improve the navigation accuracy. Results: The results showed that the self-tuning controller could effectively suppress the influence of the sideslip of the automatic navigation sprayer in paddy field, and improve the path tracking accuracy and stability. The maximum lateral tracking error was less than 0. 1 m for straight trajectory tracking at the traveling speeds of 1. 2 m/s. Discussion: The self-tuning controller designed in this study is based on linear system, but the complexity of the paddy field environment will lead to the mismatch of the linear system model. In the future, the nonlinear adaptive control method based on online system identification should be used to design the navigation controller. Conclusion: In order to suppress the interference caused by sideslip to the navigation control system of the <b>Self-propelled</b> HighClearanceBoom <b>sprayer,</b> a navigation controller with self-tuning pole assignment based on lateral tracking error was designed to improve the accuracy and stability of the path tracking in paddy field environment...|$|R
40|$|The EN 13790 and {{agricultural}} products certification standards stimulated the sprayers inspections in a yearly basis in Portugal. Since 2006 Centro Operativo e Tecnológico Hortofrutícola Nacional (COTHN) inspected almost 3000 sprayers throughout the all country, including field crops sprayers, air assisted sprayers for bush and tree crops {{and a few}} hand held sprayers for greenhouse crops. In 2009 and 2010, Ambi 3 Q and A. CANO began with sprayers inspections {{in the north and}} south of Portugal, respectively. The implementation of the article 8 of the European Directive CE 128 / 09 in all member states is an important step to minimize environmental impacts, protect human health and improve plant protection efficacy. However it is not an easy task due to the characteristics of agriculture and sprayers in use of each country. The actual legislation concerning the construction and inspection of sprayers was published in the last 3 years. According to the article 8 of the European Directive, the Official Service Direcção-Geral de Agricultura e Desenvolvimento Rural (DGADR) of the Agriculture Ministry, developed the Portuguese law Decreto-Lei n. º 86 / 2010 de 15 de Julho, in 2010, to impose that mounted sprayers, trailed <b>sprayers</b> and <b>self-propelled</b> <b>sprayers</b> must be inspected and approved before 26 November, 2016.

The multi-mode steering system was evaluated by driving the sprayer through specified paths in the different steering modes. The position and heading of the vehicle were measured for each mode using two dual frequency DGPS receivers. From the measure of vehicle posture, sprayer performance measures such as over/underspray and crop damage were assessed for each steering mode.

40|$|A <b>self-propelled</b> {{agricultural}} <b>sprayer</b> with four-wheel steering (4 WS) was developed. A {{digital controller}} {{was designed and}} built to control the rear steering angle based on that of the front wheels through electrohydraulic control valves. Three modes of steering were enabled and investigated. Experimental methods were developed to determine what potential 4 WS has in improving machine performance. In particular, machine performance of the sprayer was evaluated by measuring turning radius and performance metrics in headland turning and lateral path shift procedures. Coordinated 4 WS resulted in smaller turning radii than conventional two-wheel steering (2 WS). In the headland turning tests, significant mean increases in aligning distance of 5. 58 m and significant mean decreases in rear wheel off-tracking area of 9. 3 m 2 were observed in 4 WS over 2 WS. In lateral path correction tests, crab 4 WS substantially decreased the area and magnitude of estimated application errors over conventional 2 WS, while coordinated 4 WS resulted in increased application errors. These results provide evidence that 4 WS could enable improvement in sprayer machine performance...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{spray boom}} {{is one of}} the sprayer {{components}} that most affect the application quality and may cause phytotoxicity and overlay application problems. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the displacement in the vertical and horizontal movements of the spray booms in three models of <b>self-propelled</b> boom <b>sprayers.</b> The vibrations of the spray boom in the vertical direction was measured using three receivers (GNSS) with RTK differential correction. The vibration measurements in the horizontal direction were determined using a high resolution camera. At the end, the processed data were entered into a spreadsheet for the descriptive statistics. The smallest spray boom movement in the horizontal direction was obtained by the specimen 2. No statistical differences were observed between the different speeds for the spray boom vibration in the horizontal and vertical directions, in the evaluated sprayers.

40|$|The aim of {{exposure}} assessment {{in this context}} is to consider realistic and high exposure scenarios arising from the proposed Good Agricultural Practice for non-dietary systemic exposure that can be compared with appropriate toxicological reference values. The calculator can be used to assess exposures for operators (persons who are involved in activities relating to the application of a plant protection products (PPP), workers (persons who, as part of their employment, enter an area that has been treated previously with a PPP or who handle a crop that has been treated with a PPP), bystanders (persons who could be located within or directly adjacent to the area where PPP application or treatment is in process or has recently been completed) and residents (persons who live, work or attend school or any other institution adjacent to an area that is or has been treated with a PPP). The Data Entry form requires information about the plant protection product, toxicological reference values and a description of the intended use. The operator exposure uses the AOEM model (Großkopf, 2012) and includes application techniques and scenarios for outdoor treatment of low and high crops, by vehicle-mounted/trailed or <b>self-propelled</b> <b>sprayers</b> or by hand-held spray guns and knapsack sprayers. 75 th and 95 th centile exposures are estimated for both mixing and loading and application and these can be modified by applying suitable combinations of PPE. An additional sheet allows the estimation of operator exposure for granular formulations based on the Pesticide Handlers Exposure Database (PHED, 1992). The worker worksheet estimates dermal and inhalation exposure for indoor and outdoor worker scenarios. The Transfer Coefficients for dermal exposure were modified from EUROPOEM II (2002) considering US EPA (2012) and for inhalation exposure Task Specific Factors are taken from van Hemmen et al., 2002. For resident and bystander exposure four pathways are considered; spray drift at time of application, vapour inhalation after application, surface deposits and entry into treated crops. Resident exposure considers a 24 -hour duration {{of exposure}} and calculates 75 th centile and mean exposure values, whereas bystander exposure considers a 2 hour duration of exposure with 95 th centile values. A vehicle-mounted sprayer scenario is used for resident and bystander exposure assessment and users parameters from BREAM for arable crops and from Rautmann/Ganzelmeier for orchards. The exposure estimates for all four groups are summarised and presented in a report, which can be copied or printed...|$|R

The resulting DEMs were compared with each other to evaluate the effect of including attitude measurement on DEM accuracy. At the widest measurement swath width, the DEMs generated with attitude measurements had RMSE values of 10 to 11 cm, which was significantly lower than the RMSE of 15 cm associated with the DEMs generated without attitude measurements. Vehicle speed affected DEM error, but no discernable trends were detected. These results provide evidence supporting the feasibility of using vehicle-based measurements collected during typical field operation for accurate DEM development...|$|R
40|$|Sensor fusion {{technique}} has been commonly used {{for improving the}} navigation of autonomous agricultural vehicles by means of combining complimentary sensors mounted on such vehicles for the position and attitude angle measurements. In this research, sensor fusion via an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) was used to integrate the attitude angle estimates from the Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and Terrain Compensation Module (TCM) sensor to improve the roll and pitch angle measurements of a self propelled sprayer. The fusion algorithm was also developed to improve the three-dimensional positioning of the sprayer, in particular the elevation measurements of a GPS receiver mounted on the sprayer. Vehicle attitude and field elevation were measured at two speeds, 5. 6 km/h and 9. 6 km/h, using a set of onboard sensors including a real-time kinematic-differential GPS receiver (RTK-DGPS), a TCM sensor and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). A second order auto-regressive (AR) model was developed to model the TCM roll and GPS-based pitch errors. The derived error states were incorporated into the EKF algorithm and the measurement noise covariance was estimated from the AR model, which limited the fine tuning of noise covariance to the process noise covariance only. The EKF estimations were compared with the IMU measurements to validate {{the performance of the}} developed fusion algorithm. For the slow speed test data, the mean and standard deviation of the errors of roll (Mean: - 0. 2244 º, Std. Dev. : 1. 471 º) and pitch (Mean: 0. 0597 º, Std. Dev. : 0. 6621 º) from the EKF estimates were reduced considerably compared to that of the errors of roll (Mean: 0. 2157 º, Std. Dev. : 2. 4610 º) and pitch (Mean: 0. 0473 º, Std. Dev. : 1. 3230 º) from DEM. Medium speed test data also showed considerable improvement in the attitude angles estimated using the developed EKF algorithm. The fusion algorithm for improving the elevation measurement of the GPS also showed promising results. Thus, the fusion algorithm was effective in improving attitude and the navigational accuracy of the <b>self-propelled</b> agricultural <b>sprayer,</b> which in turn will also facilitate the automatic control of the implements that interact with the soil surface on undulated topographic surfaces...|$|R

These combinations of speed and droplet size were evaluated for percent coverage of the spray and percent control of targeted weeds 3, 7, and 15 days after treatment (DAT). Four replications were conducted for each speed and droplet size combination except for at 19 km/h (12 mph) where only three replications were used (35 plots).

40|$|Agricultural {{producers}} face {{a multitude}} of pre- and post-emergence input application decisions, including herbicides, insecticides, plant growth regulators and harvest aids. Many of these inputs are applied on a repetitive basis, resulting in multiple trips across the field and increased chemical, labor and application costs. Variable rate technology (VRT) for <b>self-propelled,</b> boom-type agricultural <b>sprayers</b> may reduce these chemical and application costs. A VRT system is a package of precision agriculture technologies that are used jointly to: (i) measure the spatial variability of input needs within a farm field; (ii) prescribe site-specific application rates that match varying crop needs; and (iii) apply those inputs as prescribed (Ess, Morgan and Parsons, 2001). This contrasts with uniform rate technology (URT) where {{the goal is to}} maintain a constant application rate across the entire field. VRT has the potential to lower production costs and improve farm profitability by avoiding unnecessary input use. The actual level of input savings realized will vary from field to field depending on the degree of spatial variability and the quantity of chemical inputs applied (Roberts, English and Larson, 2006). Spatial variability is defined here as the distribution of distinct management zones within a field for which the yield response to a particular input varies (English, Roberts and Mahajanashetti, 2001). Such zones may be delineated by one or more characteristic, such as soil type, drainage, weed pressure or crop biomass indices. Cost savings from VRT relative to URT will be greater in fields with greater spatial variability since the optimal application rate will also vary more...|$|R
