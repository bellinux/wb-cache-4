5000|$|In February 1969, WITCH held {{a protest}} at a [...] "Bridal Fair" [...] at Madison Square Garden. Wearing black veils, they chanted [...] "here comes the slaves/off to their graves", and posted {{stickers}} {{around the area}} emblazoned with the statement [...] "Confront the Whoremakers", a pun on the common leftist slogan [...] "Confront the Warmakers". The protests also involved turning loose several white mice at the event, which Fair attendees began scooping up off the ground. Radical feminists criticised WITCH for reinforcing the <b>sexist</b> <b>stereotype</b> that the assembled women would be scared of mice. They also condemned what they understood as WITCH's approach of promoting a message of [...] "we're liberated and you're not" [...] to other women, believing that in doing so they were distancing and alienating themselves from feminism's base constituency. Later historian Alice Echols expressed criticism over what she saw as WITCH's [...] "contempt" [...] for those women who {{were not involved in}} leftist activism. The event resulted in negative media coverage for WITCH, and some dissention among members over goals and tactics. After the incident, WITCH moved away from the shock tactics that they had previously employed and instead focused their attention on consciousness raising.|$|E
5000|$|Academic Jyotsna Kapur {{identifies}} Panic Room as one {{of several}} American conspiracy thrillers in the 2000s that re-cast the subject of childhood as [...] "one of horror and alarm", where it had previously been a subject of celebration in family films {{dating back to the}} early 1980s. Kapur also says the depiction of paranoia in the decade's conspiracy thrillers is divided by gender. She describes the male protagonist as [...] "an idealized subject who thinks fast on his feet and cuts through fear to find the conspirators". In contrast, the female protagonist [...] "gives in to her fear, turns delusional and vulnerable to suggestion"; Kapur cites Meg Altman in Panic Room as such a depiction with her divorcee status and her residence in a home too big for her and her daughter Sarah. The academic says calling this depiction merely a <b>sexist</b> <b>stereotype</b> is too dismissive: [...] "It is logical that anxieties around the home and loss of children would privilege women because the domestic sphere has remained a gendered space." [...] Kapur recalls 1940s films wherein a woman enters the husband's home as a stranger, with [...] "the house and the husband as sources of dependence and dread". She contrasts them with films like Panic Room, in which the female protagonists instead defend against dangerous intruders. She writes, [...] "They are not economically dependent on the marriage. Yet they portray for most of the film an image of feminized vulnerability, replaying the racist trope of diminutive white women in need of protection from outsider threats." ...|$|E

A qualitative study was performed on four campaigns featuring female nurses in white dresses and caps, using descriptive and inferential content analysis. Conclusions show that female nurses appearing in advertising transmit both <b>sexist</b> <b>stereotypes</b> (female profession, gentleness, lack of control, strong affectivity, frivolousness, passivity, submissiveness, commitment to basic care, merely sexual and aesthetic value) and sexist biases (androcentrism and double standards).

The main research hypothesis of this article is that the persistence of <b>sexist</b> <b>stereotypes</b> in advertising is related to the absence of women in the creative departments of advertising agencies. In this sense, the objective of this work is to examine the situation of women within the Galician advertising sector, and particularly women‟s participation in ads production.

Therefore, one strategy to adopt in combating inequality between genders is to raise awareness and sensitivity of teachers concerning gender inequality.
