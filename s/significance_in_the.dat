5|$|A {{study by}} {{astronomer}} Steven J. Dick at the United States Naval Observatory considered the cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact by analyzing events of similar <b>significance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> history of science. The study {{argues that the}} impact would be most strongly influenced by the information content of the message received, if any. It distinguishes short-term and long-term impact. Seeing radio-based contact as a more plausible scenario than a visit from extraterrestrial spacecraft, the study rejects the commonly stated analogy of European colonization of the Americas as an accurate model for information-only contact, preferring events of profound scientific significance, such as the Copernican and Darwinian revolutions, as more predictive of how humanity might be impacted by extraterrestrial contact.|$|E

Another site of <b>significance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> reserve is the Bogong Rocks shelter, which contains the oldest evidence of Aboriginal occupation at a bogong moth resting site. These insects were an important source of food for the Aboriginal peoples of the Southern Alps and would accumulate by the thousands in caves and rock crevices, where they were collected and later roasted in sand or ashes, and then eaten whole.|$|E
5|$|Both {{real and}} fictitious plants play {{a wide variety}} of roles in {{literature}} and film. Plants' roles may be evil, as with the triffids, carnivorous plants with a whip-like poisonous sting as well as mobility provided by three foot-like appendages, from John Wyndham's 1951 science fiction novel The Day of the Triffids, and subsequent films and radio plays. J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth makes use of many named kinds of plant, including the healing herb athelas the yellow star-flower elanor which grows in special places such as Cerin Amroth in Lothlórien, and the tall mallorn tree of the elves. Tolkien names several individual trees of <b>significance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> narrative, including the Party Tree in the Shire with its happy associations, and the malevolent Old Man Willow in the Old Forest.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to lack of}} {{centralized}} logistical system, the Polish armies were encumbered {{by large}} baggage trains. To some degree, this was turned into an advantage {{with the development of}} the tabor– military horse-drawn wagons, usually carrying army supplies. The wagon use for defensive formations was perfected by the Cossacks, and to a smaller extent used by other Commonwealth units. The Commonwealth army relied on cavalry, which the nobility saw as a much more respectable type of a troop than the infantry. Despite the reforms of the 17th century, it lost much of its military <b>significance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 18th century; the primary reason for this was a lack of sufficient funding.|$|E
5|$|During the Carboniferous period (359–299 Ma), Scotland lay {{close to}} the equator.

Fossil Grove in Victoria Park, Glasgow contains the preserved remains of a Carboniferous forest. More volcanic activity formed Arthur's Seat and the Salisbury Crags in Edinburgh and the nearby Bathgate Hills.|$|E

5|$|The {{black swan}} (Cygnus atratus) is widely {{referenced}} in Australian culture, although {{the character of}} that importance historically diverges between the prosaic in the East and the symbolic in West. The black swan is also of spiritual <b>significance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> traditional histories of many Australian Aboriginal peoples across southern Australia.

5|$|The bloody Wheatfield {{remained}} {{quiet for}} the rest of the battle. But it took a heavy toll on the men who traded possession back-and-forth. The Confederates had fought six brigades against 13 (somewhat smaller) Federal brigades, and of the 20,444 men engaged, about 30% were casualties. Some of the wounded managed to crawl to Plum Run but could not cross it. The river ran red with their blood. As with the Cornfield at Antietam, this small expanse of agricultural ground would be remembered by veterans as a name of unique <b>significance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> history of warfare.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the dish are unclear.

However, there is a reference in an Australian newspaper to the dish, which includes a brief recipe, from 1882.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} English players and {{commentators}} noted Bradman's discomfort in playing the short, rising delivery. The revelation {{came too late}} for this particular match, but was to have immense <b>significance</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next Ashes series. Australia won the match by an innings and regained the Ashes. The victory made an impact in Australia. With the economy sliding toward depression and unemployment rapidly rising, the country found solace in sporting triumph. The story of a self-taught 22-year-old from the bush who set a series of records against the old rival made Bradman a national hero. The statistics Bradman achieved on the tour, and in the Test matches in particular, broke records {{for the day and}} some have stood the test of time. In all, Bradman scored 974runs at an average of 139.14 during the Test series, with four centuries, including two double hundreds and a triple. As of 2012, no-one has matched or exceeded 974runs or three double centuries in one Test series; the record of 974runs exceeds the second-best performance by 69runs and was achieved in two fewer innings. Bradman's first-class tally, 2,960runs (at an average of 98.66 with 10centuries), was another enduring record: the most by any overseas batsman on a tour of England.|$|E
