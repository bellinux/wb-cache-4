50|$|When {{the rods}} {{at the pump}} end are {{travelling}} up, the traveling valve is closed and the <b>standing</b> <b>valve</b> is open (due to the drop in pressure in the pump barrel). Consequently, the pump barrel fills with the fluid from the formation as the traveling piston lifts the previous contents of the barrel upwards. When the rods begin pushing down, the traveling valve opens and the <b>standing</b> <b>valve</b> closes (due {{to an increase in}} pressure in the pump barrel). The traveling valve drops through the fluid in the barrel (which had been sucked in during the upstroke). The piston then reaches the end of its stroke and begins its path upwards again, repeating the process.|$|E
50|$|Valves: The valves {{have two}} {{components}} - {{the seat and}} the ball - which create a complete seal when closed. The most commonly used seats are made of carbon nitride and the ball is often made of silicon nitride. In the past, balls of iron, ceramic and titanium were used. Titanium balls are still being used but only where crude oil is extremely dense and/or the quantity of fluid to be lifted is large. The most common configuration of a rod pump requires two valves, called the traveling valve and the fixed (or static or <b>standing)</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|E
50|$|At {{the bottom}} of the tubing is the {{down-hole}} pump. This pump has two ball check valves: a stationary valve at bottom called the <b>standing</b> <b>valve,</b> and a valve on the piston connected to {{the bottom of}} the sucker rods that travels up and down as the rods reciprocate, known as the traveling valve. Reservoir fluid enters from the formation into {{the bottom of the}} borehole through perforations that have been made through the casing and cement (the casing is a larger metal pipe that runs the length of the well, which has cement placed between it and the earth; the tubing, pump, and sucker rod are all inside the casing).|$|E
5000|$|When standing, gravity {{pulls the}} blood {{downwards}} {{to the lower}} part of the body. Body mechanisms, such as vasoconstriction and valves of the veins, assist in pumping blood upwards. As blood is pumped through the body, the valves within the veins prevent the blood from flowing backwards. After extensive, prolonged <b>standing,</b> these <b>valves</b> can become weak and eventually fail. When this happens, blood is no longer being prevented from flowing backward. Gravity will pull the blood back into an individuals legs, ankles and feet. This forces the veins to expand or [...] "balloon" [...] to accommodate this extra blood.|$|R
50|$|Differences in mean blood {{pressure}} are responsible for blood flow from one location to another in the circulation. The rate of mean blood flow depends on both {{blood pressure}} and the resistance to flow presented by the blood vessels. Mean blood pressure decreases as the circulating blood {{moves away from the}} heart through arteries and capillaries due to viscous losses of energy. Mean blood pressure drops over the whole circulation, although most of the fall occurs along the small arteries and arterioles. Gravity affects blood pressure via hydrostatic forces (e.g., during <b>standing),</b> and <b>valves</b> in veins, breathing, and pumping from contraction of skeletal muscles also influence blood pressure in veins.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the relationship between left atrial pressure and volume, left atrial echograms and mean pulmonary wedge pressure were obtained on 64 patients with various cardiac diseases. A statistically significant relationship {{was found in the}} whole group (r = 0. 67, p < 0. 01), but there was a considerable degree of dispersion around the regression line. A good correlation was present in 6 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (r = 0. 97, p < 0. 01) and in 13 patients with long <b>standing</b> mitral <b>valve</b> disease (r = 0. 85, p < 0. 01). There was no correlation in coronary artery disease patients...|$|R
50|$|Often, gas is {{produced}} {{through the same}} perforations as the oil. This can be problematic if gas enters the pump, because it can result in {{what is known as}} gas locking, where insufficient pressure builds up in the pump barrel to open the valves (due to compression of the gas) and little or nothing is pumped. To preclude this, the inlet for the pump can be placed below the perforations. As the gas-laden fluid enters the well bore through the perforations, the gas bubbles up the annulus (the space between the casing and the tubing) while the liquid moves down to the <b>standing</b> <b>valve</b> inlet. Once at the surface, the gas is collected through piping connected to the annulus.|$|E

This paper {{presents}} a dynamic model of vertical oil wells using artificial elevation by suckerrod pumping. The modeling {{of the system}} is separated by modules that provide a good understanding of the system. The modules are: a) induction motor, using a stationary model that describes the behavior of movement transmitted to the pumping unit in function of load received b) pumping unit, responsible for describing the transformation of the rotational movement to alternative movement by the kinematic model, c) rod string, using a model with concentrated parameters to describe the propagation of movement along of the rod string d) fluid, used to describe the motion of fluid in the column of production according to the movement of the rod string d) subsurface pump, which describes the behavior of the variation of pressure inside the pump according to the movement of the piston, the actuation of traveling and <b>standing</b> <b>valves</b> and the production of fluid to the surface, f) annular, used to describe the behavior of fluid flow in the revetment; g) reservoir, describing the production of fluid from the reservoir to the well with the linear model and the Vogel IPR curve (inflow performance relationship). The main advantage of this modeling is the use of, whenever possible, instead of concentrated parameters distributed parameters, which allows the use of ordinary differential equations instead of partial differential equations, the simulation is much more comple...|$|R
25|$|During each heartbeat, blood {{pressure}} varies between a maximum (systolic) and a minimum (diastolic) pressure. The {{blood pressure}} in the circulation is principally due to the pumping action of the heart. Differences in mean blood pressure are responsible for blood flow from one location to another in the circulation. The rate of mean blood flow depends on both blood pressure and the resistance to flow presented by the blood vessels. Mean blood pressure decreases as the circulating blood {{moves away from the}} heart through arteries and capillaries due to viscous losses of energy.

40|$|The {{study of}} the {{two-phase}} flow through the <b>standing</b> and traveling <b>valves</b> used in an oil artificial-lift pumping unit is presented. The investigation aimed {{to determine the effects}} the gaseous phase may cause on the pump volumetric efficiency. Data obtained on a specially designed test facility is presented and analyzed as a first step before developing a semi-empirical model to predict the performance of the pump under two-phase flow conditions. Preliminary results, based on one-phase and two-phase runs, demonstrate important features introduced on the pump performance once the gas-phase is included in the proces...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} spintronic strain sensor capable of sensing strain with a {{sensitivity}} of 1 E- 13 /sqrt{Hz} {{at room temperature}} with an active sensing area of 1 cmE 2 and power dissipation of 1 watt. This device measures strain by monitoring {{the change in the}} spin-polarized current in a parallel array of free <b>standing</b> nanowire spin <b>valves</b> when the array is subjected to compressive or tensile stress along the wires' length. The change in the current is linearly proportional to the strain, which makes the sensor relatively distortion-free. Such a sensor can be fabricated using a variety of techniques involving nanolithography, self assembly and epitaxial growth. Comment: Will appear in Journal of Physics D: Applied Physic...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Long {{standing}} pulmonary regurgitation {{results in}} deleterious effects on right heart size and function with late consequences of right heart volume overload including ventricular dilatation, propensity to arrhythmia and right heart failure. As sleep disordered breathing may predispose to elevations in pulmonary vascular resistance and associated {{negative effects on}} right ventricular function, we sought to assess this in patients with underlying congenital heart disease. Design: We performed a pilot study to evaluate the incidence of sleep-disordered breathing in a patient population {{with a history of}} long <b>standing</b> pulmonary <b>valve</b> incompetence in patients with congenital heart disease using overnight oximetry. Patients. Patients with a background of tetralogy of Fallot repair or residual pulmonary incompetence following previous pulmonary valve intervention for congenital pulmonary stenosis were included. Results: Twenty-two patients underwent overnight oximetry. The mean age of the cohort was 34. 3 ± 15. 2 years with no patients observed to have severe underlying pulmonary hypertension. Abnormal overnight oximetry was seen in 13 / 22 patients (59. 1 %) with 2 / 22 (9. 1 %) patients considered to have severe abnormalities. Conclusions: An important proportion of patients with a background of pulmonary incompetence complicating congenital heart disease are prone to the development of sleep-disordered breathing as assessed by overnight oximetry. Further study into the prevalence and mechanisms of sleep-disordered breathing in a larger cohort are warranted...|$|R

In this work, we present (a) current-perpendicular-to-plane (CPP) MR effect in multilayer graphene (MLG) grown on cobalt (Co) foil and (b) spin valve MR effect in a vertical array of multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) spin valves. In part (a) strong room-temperature CPP-MR effects have been observed in as-grown MLG on Co. The origin of the MR effect lies in the graphene-Co interface and interlayer coupling between the graphene layers of MLG. In part (b) an array of vertically <b>standing</b> MWCNT spin <b>valves</b> has been synthesized in the pores of an anodic alumina template. A spin valve MR and spin relaxation length of ~ 0. 28 µm have been observed at 8 K, which disappears at higher temperature. This indicates necessity of alternative designs for room temperature operation of MWCNT spin valves...|$|R
