40|$|Wheat dwarf virus (WDV; family Geminiviridae, genus Mastrevirus) is a {{single-stranded}} DNA virus {{transmitted by}} the leafhopper Psammotettix alienus and it periodically causes severe damage to winter wheat in Sweden. WDV is {{also present in}} large parts of Europe. Two strains of WDV are known, the wheat strain and the barley strain. To get {{better understanding of the}} genetic diversity of WDV in Sweden and compare to the situation {{in the rest of the}} world, several isolates from wheat, triticale, wild grasses and the insect vector were collected and partially sequenced. All isolates collected in Sweden were shown to belong to the wheat strain of WDV. From Turkey and Hungary, two barley strain isolates were collected and complete genome sequences were determined. WDV infection in wild grasses was shown to occur only sporadically in Swedish grasslands, even in samples collected adjacent to heavily infected winter wheat fields. This indicates that wild grasses are not important as a primary source of WDV for the insect vector. Infected grasses might instead act as virus reservoirs, enabling WDV to prevail without winter wheat. The diversity of the <b>Swedish</b> <b>wheat</b> strain isolates and available international isolates was shown to be low. In phylogenetic analyses, no clear grouping could be seen according to geographical origin or host. The partial sequences of barley strain isolates grouped into three distinct clades: one Central-European clade with isolates from Germany, Hungary and Czech Republic, one clade with isolates from Spain and one clade with the Turkish isolates. For future studies on the host specificity determinants of the two WDV strains, infectious clones, transmissible by Agrobacterium tumefaciens, were constructed. The infectious clone of the barley strain was constructed from the Hungarian isolate WDV-Bar[HU]. The clone WDV-Bar[HU] was shown to infect barley, oat and rye. The biological activity of the barley infectious clone was further confirmed by insect transmission and typical WDV particles were visualised by electron microscopy. An infectious clone was also constructed for a <b>Swedish</b> <b>wheat</b> strain isolate and was confirmed to be able to infect wheat.

Control {{is dependent on}} organophosphates {{some of which are}} restricted in the UK, while current oviposition monitoring techniques are labour intensive and subjective. Eggs are not laid in association with a host-plant, therefore, prompt location of a suitable host is critical to the survival of the newly hatched larvae. <b>Wheat</b> bulb <b>fly</b> larvae have been shown to exhibit a positive chemotactic response to wheat and other host-plant seedlings and their root exudates. The objective {{of this study was to}} improve the control and population monitoring methodology associated with WBF, by investigating the ecology and specifically the chemical ecology of the WBF. Bioassays were used to investigate the behavioural response of WBF to known chemical constituents of host-plant exudates. Four secondary metabolites were found to be attractive while CO 2 was found to alter the behaviour of larvae. <b>Wheat</b> bulb <b>fly</b> oviposition was assessed in field situations to describe egg laying spatially and through time. Geostatistical and ecological techniques were used to observe the spatial dependence and dispersion of oviposition and construct contour maps or scale-sized dot graphs of oviposition density. The traditional single line transect sampling pattern was compared against a more intensive sampling regime. Oviposition monitoring was conducted over a three year period to ascertain the time of peak egg density of this fly. A molecular based diagnostic test to assess WBF egg populations for damage forecasting was developed. A real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol was produced to estimate field populations of WBF eggs through the quantification of eggs from field samples. In addition endpoint PCR was used to identify the presence or absence of eggs from samples.

This differs from development data in laboratory bioassays and suggests that there is a pre-alighting cue deterring aphid settlement and demonstrates differences in aphid preference and performance on older plants in the field compared with seedlings in the laboratory, highlighting the need for phenotyping for aphid resistance at different plant growth stages.

40|$|Some <b>Swedish</b> spring <b>wheat</b> {{varieties}} {{have recently}} been shown to carry a rare wildtype (wt) allele of the gene NAM-B 1, known to affect leaf senescence and nutrient retranslocation to the grain. The wt allele is believed to increase grain protein concentration and has attracted interest from breeders since it could contribute to higher grain quality and more nitrogen-efficient varieties. This study investigated whether Swedish varieties with the wt allele differ from varieties {{with one of the}} more common, non-functional alleles in order to examine the effect of the gene in a wide genetic background, and possibly explain why the allele has been retained in Swedish varieties. Forty varieties of spring wheat differing in NAM-B 1 allele type were cultivated under controlled conditions. Senescence was monitored and grains were harvested and analyzed for mineral nutrient concentration. Varieties with the wt allele reached anthesis earlier and completed senescence faster than varieties with the non-functional allele. The wt varieties also had more ears, lighter grains and higher yields of P and K. Contrary to previous information on effects of the wt allele, our wt varieties did not have increased grain N concentration or grain N yield. In addition, temporal studies showed that straw length has decreased but grain N yield has remained unaffected over a century of <b>Swedish</b> spring <b>wheat</b> breeding. The faster development of wt varieties supports the hypothesis of NAM-B 1 being preserved in Fennoscandia, with its short growing season, because of accelerated development conferred by the NAM-B 1 wt allele.

40|$|Cereal aphid (Sitobion avenae) and <b>wheat</b> bulb <b>fly</b> (Delia coarctata) {{are serious}} pests of wheat in the UK. At the present, {{chemical}} pesticides {{are used to}} control these insects, but they are limited in effectiveness, and have undersirable ecological impacts. There {{is a need to}} improve wheat genetically to be resistant to such inset pests. The objectives of this work were to investigate digestive biochemistry in the selected insect pests of wheat, and to determine effects of potential endogenous resistance factors in wheat on digestion, nutrition and other insect metabolic processes. The aim was to develop new strategies for crop protection. Digestive biochemistry in S. avenae and D. coarctata was studied to characterise gut proteases and their inhibition by host plant proteinase inhibitors (PIs). Investigation of proteolytic digestion in S. avenae gut showed that in spite of being a phloem-feeding insect, cereal aphid could digest ingested protein, using cysteine proteases. D. coarctata larvae contained mainly serine protease activity. A serine protease (DcSP) and a cysteine protease (DcCathL) from D. coarctata gut tissue were expressed as recombinant proteins. Only DcCathL was recovered in active form. DcCathL was insecticidal to Mamestra brassicae when injected into hemolymph, causing systemic and extensive melanisation. DcCathL selectively degraded recombinant serpins from M. brassicae in in vitro assays, and is suggested to interfere with regulation of the proteolytic cascade leading to phenoloxidase activation and melanin production in vivo. DcCathL has potential as a biopesticide if it could be made effective when orally delivered. A cationic amino acid transporter from D. coarctata gut (DcCAAT) was also cloned as a target for RNA interference. Potential resistance factors in wheat were characterised by expression as recombinant proteins. Two PIs from wheat (subtilisin/chymotrypsin inhibitor; WSCI, and cysteine proteinase inhibitor; WCPI) were expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris, and purified. WSCI inhibited gut protease activity of both insects in in vitro and in vivo assays, whereas WCPI only inhibited S. avenae gut extract activity. On feeding, WSCI was antimetabolic to both insects, affecting both survival and growth, whereas WCPI was antimetabolic to S. avenae only. <b>Wheat</b> Hessian <b>fly</b> responsive (Hfr) genes are up-regulated in response to herbivory by Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor). The protein product Hfr- 3 was expressed and purified, and showed antimetabolic effects on survival and growth of both S. avenae and D. coarctata. Both accumulated and induced defence proteins, like WSCI, WCPI and Hfr- 3, have the potential to act as endogenous resistance factors in wheat towards a range of insect pests. Developing a wheat variety constitutively expressing these defence proteins by using traditional breeding methods and/or modern biotechnological tools is discussed. ...|$|R

Arena based behavioural experiments were used to identify whether CO 2 induced chemotaxis (directional movement in response to a chemical stimulus) or kinesis (non-directional movement in response to a stimulus) from WBF larvae. No chemotactic response was observed when larvae were presented to a point source of CO 2. However, elevated levels of CO 2 induced kinesis, with both track length and tortuosity (number of twists and turns in the movement path) increasing at elevated CO 2 levels of 1000 - 2000 ppm, demonstrating increased searching behaviour. Soil emission of CO 2 was quantified to compare soil levels with those identified as eliciting behavioural effects on the larvae. Samples removed from soil gave a mean CO 2 concentration of 557 (± 46) ppm, which is lower than the lowest concentration of CO 2 found to induce a behavioural response and higher than the lowest CO 2 concentration tested, which was found not to alter behaviour. It is proposed that increased CO 2 concentrations in the soil act as a behavioural trigger, inducing intensive searching of an area by WBF larvae.

This HF resistance is conditioned by two genes in complementary epistasis, one gene that is ineffective by itself and a second gene that is partially effective against certain biotypes of HF. The fusarium head blight (FHB) -resistance QTL, Qfhs. pur- 7 EL, from tall wheatgrass (Thinopyrum ponticum) was introgressed onto the long arm of wheat chromosome 7 D. Two yellow dwarf virus disease (YD) -resistance genes, Bdv 2 from chromosome 7 St and Bdv 3 from chromosome 7 E, were independently introgressed from intermediate wheatgrass (Thinopyrum intermedium) onto the long arm of wheat chromosome 7 D. Qfhs. pur- 7 EL and Bdv 3 were combined in coupling, providing resistance to two important diseases of wheat, and these two resistance factors will remain in coupling in wheat. Bdv 2 was moved to wheat chromosome 7 B, which will enable combining Bdv 2 and Bdv 3 in wheat, potentially increasing the level of YD-resistance similar to that in intermediate wheatgrass.

40|$|Background: <b>Wheat</b> – Hessian <b>fly</b> {{interaction}} {{follows a}} typical gene-for-gene model. Hessian fly larvae die in wheat plants carrying an effective resistance gene, or thrive in susceptible plants that carry no effective resistance gene. Results: Gene sets affected by Hessian fly attack in resistant plants {{were found to}} be very different from those in susceptible plants. Differential expression of gene sets was associated with differential accumulation of intermediates in defense pathways. Our results indicated that resources were rapidly mobilized in resistant plants for defense, including extensive membrane remodeling and release of lipids, sugar catabolism, and amino acid transport and degradation. These resources were likely rapidly converted into defense molecules such as oxylipins; toxic proteins including cysteine proteases, inhibitors of digestive enzymes, and lectins; phenolics; and cell wall components. However, toxicity alone does not cause immediate lethality to Hessian fly larvae. Toxic defenses might slow down Hessian fly development and therefore give plants more time for other types of defense to become effective. Conclusion: Our gene expression and metabolic profiling results suggested that remodeling and fortification of cell wall and cuticle by increased deposition of phenolics and enhanced cross-linking were likely to be crucial for insect mortality by depriving Hessian fly larvae of nutrients from host cells. The identification {{of a large number of}} genes that were differentially expressed at different time points during compatible and incompatible interactions also provided a foundation for further research on the molecular pathways that lead to wheat resistance and susceptibility to Hessian fly infestation...|$|R
40|$|Wheat-rye translocations {{involving}} 1 RS and 2 RL of rye are {{the most}} useful sources of genes for disease resistance in wheat breeding. Rye genes are known to control resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Wheat-rye translocations {{have been widely used}} by breeders all over the world because genes located on translocated chromosome arms or fragments from the rye genome can determine a number of useful traits in wheat, such as high yield, wide adaptation, diseases and pest resistance. The wheat-rye translocation lines used in this study were derived from a cross between the <b>Swedish</b> bread <b>wheat</b> variety Topper and the line KR 99 - 139 being homozygous for the two different wheat-rye translocations 1 BL/ 1 RS and 2 RL/ 2 BS. BC 1 F 1 materials were obtained through one back-cross with either the line KR 99 - 139 or the variety Topper. Thereafter, BC 1 F 2 and BC 1 F 3 were obtained by once and twice selfing. In the obtained material, it was thereafter possible to define four different possible homozygous translocation combinations. Thus, lines containing both 1 RS and 2 RL translocations, containing only 1 RS or 2 RL and without any translocation were identified. For identification of the four possible homozygous wheat-rye translocation lines mentioned above, three different methods were used. First, lines of different types were characterized and isolated based on a phenotypical marker, i. e. if the plant showed red or green coleoptile colour. Plants with homozygous presence of 2 RL were known to develop red coleoptile, as a gene for red coleoptile has been verified to be present at 2 RL in these lines. The analyses of coleoptile colours were done in the BC 1 F 2 (obtained from selfed BC 1 F 1 lines determined by molecular markers at BAZ, Germany to be 1 RS– –/ 2 RL+–) and BC 1 F 3 (obtained from the BC 1 F 2 lines having a red coleoptile) wheat-rye translocation lines, where the variety Topper had been used for backcrossing. Moreover, the BC 1 F 2 (obtained from selfed BC 1 F 1 lines determined by molecular markers at BAZ, Germany to be 1 RS++/ 2 RL+–) wheat-rye translocation lines for which the KR 99 - 139 line was used for backcrossing, was selfed, and analyses of coleoptile colours were done in the BC 1 F 3 (on a representative sample of all combinations of presence and absence of 2 RL). The results from the coleoptiles colour analyses generally showed {{that it was possible to}} distinguish lines having 2 RL++ (red coleoptiles) and 2 RL– – (green coleoptiles). 7 Plants having 2 RL+– were sometimes classified as having green and sometimes as having red coleoptiles. Therefore, if coleoptiles colour is going to be used for selection of lines with presence/absence of 2 RL in homozygous form, at least two generations have to be analyzed and lines not segregating in either of the analyses can be judged as being homozygous as related to their coleoptiles colour. For identification of lines with presence of heterozygous 1 RS+– and homozygous 2 RL++ rye chromosome the Giemsa C-banding technique was used. The Giemsa C-banding techniques on the BC 1 F 3 segregating population generally resulted in well-defined sharp, distinct bands in the wheat-rye translocation lines and both the rye chromosome arms, 1 RS and 2 RL were identified. Additionally, five microsatellite (SSR) markers SCM 9, SCM 39, SCM 43, SCM 69 and SCM 75 were used for verification of the presence of 1 RS and 2 RL. Among the five SSR markers, SCM 9 and SCM 75 resulted in reliable amplification of expected products, 220 bp and 191 bp respectively. The line KR 99 - 139 containing both 1 RS and 2 RL showed correct amplification products with both mentioned primers while the bread wheat variety Topper without any rye chromosome showed no amplification with both SSR primers pairs. Resistance towards yellow rust and stem rust were evaluated through seedling resistance test in the greenhouse (Global Rust Reference Center, Denmark) to Puccinia striiformis, and adult plant resistance to Puccinia graminis, race Ug 99 (TTKSK) in Njoro, Kenya. For the seedling resistance test, pathogenicity of 17 races/isolates of yellow rust was used. The BC 1 F 3 which carries combination of 1 RS++/ 2 RL++, 1 RS++/ 2 RL+– and the KR 99 - 139 were found to be highly resistant to some races/isolates whether the variety Topper was fully susceptible to all races/isolates. The results showed Yr 9 to be one possible gene that could be responsible for the obtained yellow rust resistance. However, the results were not that clear so than not other possible genes could also be an alternative. For adult plant resistance towards Ug 99, a total of 28 of the BC 1 F 3 wheat-rye translocation lines and their parents were evaluated in the field of Njoro, Kenya. The results indicated that out of the 30 tested lines 20 were susceptible, 8 moderately susceptible to susceptible and in 2 lines the resistance to Ug 99 was identified. The two BC 1 F 3 wheat-rye translocation lines that were found to be resistant towards Ug 99 were both being homozygous for 1 RS++ and heterozygous for 2 RL+–. Thus, these results indicated presence of several genes/QTLs controlling resistance indicating possible epistatic effects of the genes involved. The lines identified as resistant will be utilized in combination with Tajik germplasm 8 to develop a mapping population for determining the underlying basis of resistance. To summarize results from the research outlined in this thesis indicate that wheat-rye translocation lines and used methods can be highly relevant for wheat breeding programs and further research...|$|R
