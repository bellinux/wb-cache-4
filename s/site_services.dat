500|$|In 2005 the 112,500 ticket quota {{sold out}} rapidly— {{in this case}} in 3 hours 20 minutes. For 2005, the {{enclosed}} area of the festival was over , [...] had over 385 live performances, [...] and was attended by around 150,000 people. The Sunday headliner was originally scheduled to be Kylie Minogue, who instead pulled out in May to receive treatment for breast cancer. Basement Jaxx were announced as a replacement on 6 June. Both Coldplay and Basement Jaxx performed a cover of Kylie's [...] "Can't Get You Out Of My Head" [...] during their concert. 2005 saw a big {{increase in the number}} of dance music attractions, with the multiple tents of the Dance Village replacing the solitary dance tent of previous years. This new area contained the East and West dance tents, the Dance Lounge, Roots Stage, and Pussy Parlour, as well as a relocated G Stage, formerly situated in the Glade. The introduction of the innovative silent disco by Emily Eavis allowed revellers to party into the early hours without disturbing the locals— a requirement of the festival's licensing. [...] Following the death of DJ John Peel in the autumn of 2004, the New Tent was renamed the John Peel Tent, in homage to his encouragement and love of new bands at Glastonbury. The opening day of the 2005 festival was delayed by heavy rain and thunderstorms: Several stages, including the Acoustic Tent (and one of the bars), were struck by lightning, and the valley was hit with flash floods that left some areas of the site under more than four feet of water. The severity of the weather flooded several campsites, the worst affected being the base of Pennard Hill, and seriously disrupted <b>site</b> <b>services.</b> However Mendip District Council's review of the festival called it one of the [...] "safest ever" [...] and gives the festival a glowing report in how it dealt with the floods.|$|E

Design/methodology/approach: Data from an online survey of consumers across two studies were obtained. Findings: The results support the conceptualization and operationalization of web <b>site</b> <b>service</b> quality and its effects on word of mouth and loyalty. Research limitations/implications: Implications for the measurement of consumer perceptions of web <b>site</b> <b>service</b> quality are highlighted for researchers, and directions for future research are discussed. Practical implications: E‐service providers should carefully consider customer experiences on their web sites, and their management efforts to ensure they design and deliver the appropriate levels of service quality derived through the specific components of web <b>site</b> <b>service</b> quality. Originality/value: The findings are of value to e‐service practitioners managing web <b>site</b> <b>service</b> quality and offer empirical support to its formative conceptualization. The focus here on formative modeling will stimulate discussion among e‐service researchers and practitioners, which could result in richer e‐service quality measures leading to improved marketing decision making and web site quality management...|$|R
