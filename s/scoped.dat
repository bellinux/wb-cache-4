5|$|After {{stopping}} one of Fat Tony's operations, Homer practically rids Springfield of crime. However, Fat Tony escapes and vows to kill Homer {{unless he}} leaves town. Homer {{is unable to}} get protection from the citizens he protects (only Ned Flanders volunteers, but Homer ignores his offer) and Lenny and Carl lock themselves in a jail cell. When Homer does not leave, Fat Tony arrives {{with a few of}} his own henchmen (including Johnny Tightlips), as well as mafia muscle—the characters of the Sopranos series. Just before they are about to kill Homer, someone shoots the mobsters and injures them. Safe again, Homer resigns as police chief and offers the job to the first person who comes along, which is Wiggum (who notes that an identical situation is how he became chief in the first place). When Marge thanks him for saving Homer, Wiggum says that he did not shoot anyone, having lost his gun, badge and nearly his squad car. Unbeknownst to them, the person who saved Homer was Maggie, who fires at the mobsters from her window with a <b>scoped</b> sporting rifle.|$|E
25|$|While the Florida Department of Transportation {{operates}} and maintains {{most of the}} larger surface roads, even in incorporated areas, municipalities such as the city of Miami occasionally try to assume control over specific roads. These often include highly urban roads {{in the downtown area}} such as Brickell Avenue, where they feel the more broad <b>scoped</b> and highway oriented FDOT is inadequate in understanding the needs of such roads.|$|E
25|$|On August 1, 1966, Charles Joseph Whitman, an {{architectural}} engineering {{student at the}} university, barricaded himself in the observation deck of the tower of the Main Building with a <b>scoped</b> Remington 700 deer rifle and various other weapons.

Three police officers {{climbed to the top}} of the tower and shot him to death.|$|E
50|$|<b>Scope</b> {{can vary}} from {{as little as a}} single {{expression}} to as much as the entire program, with many possible gradations in between. The simplest <b>scoping</b> rule is global <b>scope</b> - all entities are visible throughout the entire program. The most basic modular <b>scoping</b> rule is two-level <b>scoping,</b> with a global <b>scope</b> anywhere in the program, and local <b>scope</b> within a function. More sophisticated modular programming allows a separate module <b>scope,</b> where names are visible within the module (private to the module) but not visible outside it. Within a function, some languages, such as C, allow block <b>scope</b> to restrict <b>scope</b> to a subset of a function; others, notably functional languages, allow expression <b>scope,</b> to restrict <b>scope</b> to a single expression. Other <b>scopes</b> include file <b>scope</b> (notably in C), which functions similarly to module <b>scope,</b> and block <b>scope</b> outside of functions (notably in Perl).|$|R

25|$|Minutes {{later the}} Dunedin {{branch of the}} AOS began to arrive and sealed off the {{township}} with a roadblock about 250 metres along the only road out of Aramoana, securing it with an armoured car. AOS units from Christchurch, Timaru, and Invercargill were called in for support. The situation was considered dangerous as Gray had a <b>scoped</b> rifle, making him potentially accurate at long range. By now the police had ordered that Gray was to be shot on sight – without a warning shot.|$|E
25|$|The {{intent to}} allow all {{developers}} to have artistic freedom {{with the game}} created some internal strife in the team, particularly in the level design; they had initially <b>scoped</b> that level designers would create the basic parts of a level - main paths, scripted events, and the level's general design, while the artists would build out the world from that. As development progressed, they determined that the artists should be the ones constructing the level geometry, which the level designers resented. Subsequently, levels that were generated were not to the expected standards due to conflicts in the toolsets they used and Schafer's inability to oversee the process while handling the other duties of the studio. In 2003, {{the decision was made}} to dismiss all but one of the level design team, and unify the level design and art into a World Building team overseen by Erik Robson, the remaining level designer and who would go on to become the game's lead designer; the change, which Esmurdoc stated was for the better, disrupted the other departments at Double Fine.|$|E
25|$|Survivors {{are armed}} with various firearms. Each player starts {{the game with}} a semiautomatic pistol. It may be reloaded an {{unlimited}} number of times and is the only weapon that the survivor can use when they are incapacitated. When a second pistol is found, the player can dual wield them, also with unlimited ammo. At the beginning of each campaign, the player can choose between a submachine gun and a pump-action shotgun. As the survivors progress through a campaign, more powerful weapons can be found: the fully automatic assault rifle (an upgrade to the submachine gun), a semi-automatic shotgun (an upgrade to the pump-action shotgun), and a <b>scoped</b> hunting rifle. A flashlight that can be toggled on and off is mounted on each firearm, with the exception of additional pistols. In addition to firearms, a player can also carry three other items in their inventory: improvised grenades (either a Molotov cocktail or a pipe bomb modified with an attached smoke alarm designed to attract the infected to it before it explodes); a first aid kit, which can be used to heal any survivor and pain pills, which provide temporary health that depletes gradually and quicker with damage from infected, and can be handed to teammates for later use. Regardless of what weapon or item a player is using, a melee attack can be used to shove away any infected within reach. Also available are environmental weapons, such as gas cans, propane cylinders, and oxygen tanks, all of which explode when shot. These environmental weapons can be picked up, moved, and used as a melee weapon by the survivors, but while carrying an object they cannot use their weapons or health items. Strategically placed minigun turrets are also encountered at various locations throughout the different maps.|$|E

500|$|Video game {{journalists have}} praised GoldenEye 007 for proving {{that it is}} {{possible}} to create a [...] "fun" [...] first-person shooter experience on a console in both single-player and multiplayer modes; when the game was released, the first-person shooter was primarily a genre for PC gamers. Journalists noted that the game [...] "opened the genre to a completely new market" [...] and that it was [...] "the first big console [...] that truly got it right." [...] The game has subsequently become credited alongside Shiny Entertainment's MDK for pioneering and popularising the now-standard inclusion of <b>scoped</b> sniper rifles in video games. The game's use of context-sensitive hit locations on enemies added a realism that was previously unseen in video games, though the Quake computer mod Team Fortress already featured locational damage like headshots.|$|E
500|$|After Adolf Hitler's rise {{to power}} in Germany in 1933, local ethnic German party {{established}} its own private security force. In 1938, Hitler brought his demand for succession of part of Czechoslovak borderland that was inhabited mostly by ethnic Germans. The party's security force {{was transformed into a}} paramilitary organization called [...] "Sudetendeutsches Freikorps" [...] which started conducting terror operations agaist Czechoslovak state, Jews and ethnic Czechs. Especially snipers using <b>scoped</b> hunting rifles became particular concern. This led to adoption of Act No. 81/1938, on Firearms and Ammunition, which for the first time introduced licensing system not only for carrying of firearms, but also for firearms possession. Ministry of Interior was supposed to enact a regulation which would set rules for obtaining the licenses, however, this has not happened. Freikorps was receiving illegal shipments of firearms from Germany, making the envisioned licensing scheme useless. Thus, despite the new law, the enactment of 1852 still remained in force.|$|E

500|$|Initially {{after its}} release, Double Fine had not planned on a PC {{version of the}} game, as Schafer has stated that the game is {{primarily}} an action game and [...] "meant {{to be on a}} console". However, in February 2013, Double Fine announced that a Windows version of the game will be released on February 26, 2013. The Windows port has been updated for higher resolutions of modern computers, and includes both DLC packs released for consoles. The multiplayer aspects of the PC version include a number of tweaks that Double Fine had tracked that they wanted to have made to the console version but could not do; while the full list of changes are not expected to be present in the initial PC release, Schafer has stated that if sales of the PC version are successful, they will look at adding new units, factions, and gameplay modes that they had originally <b>scoped</b> out for the console version. Mac and Linux ports were released in May 2013, premiering as part of the Humble Double Fine Bundle.|$|E

2500|$|During the mid-1980s, Ruger {{began to}} have reports of {{failures}} in the Redhawk revolvers. [...] Some Redhawks were reported to be separating at the junction between barrel and frame.

[...] The extended frame also provided enough length to allow scope bases to be mounted on the frame, rather than on the barrel as was done on the <b>scoped</b> versions of the Redhawk. [...] It was determined that the barrel separations on the Redhawks were due to a change in the lubricant used when attaching the barrels to the frames, but by that time the new Super Redhawk design was already well underway and the extended frame was kept.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Scoping</b> reviews {{are used}} to {{identify}} knowledge gaps, set research agendas, and identify implications for decision-making. The conduct and reporting of <b>scoping</b> reviews is inconsistent in the literature. We conducted a <b>scoping</b> review to identify: papers that utilized and/or described <b>scoping</b> review methods; guidelines for reporting <b>scoping</b> reviews; and studies that assessed the quality of reporting of <b>scoping</b> reviews. Methods We searched nine electronic databases for published and unpublished literature <b>scoping</b> review papers, <b>scoping</b> review methodology, and reporting guidance for <b>scoping</b> reviews. Two independent reviewers screened citations for inclusion. Data abstraction was performed by one reviewer and verified by a second reviewer. Quantitative (e. g. frequencies of methods) and qualitative (i. e. content analysis of the methods) syntheses were conducted. Results After searching 1525 citations and 874 full-text papers, 516 articles were included, of which 494 were <b>scoping</b> reviews. The 494 <b>scoping</b> reviews were disseminated between 1999 and 2014, with 45  % published after 2012. Most of the <b>scoping</b> reviews were conducted in North America (53  %) or Europe (38  %), and reported a public source of funding (64  %). The number of studies included in the <b>scoping</b> reviews ranged from 1 to 2600 (mean of 118). Using the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology guidance for <b>scoping</b> reviews, only 13  % of the <b>scoping</b> reviews reported {{the use of a}} protocol, 36  % used two reviewers for selecting citations for inclusion, 29  % used two reviewers for full-text screening, 30  % used two reviewers for data charting, and 43  % used a pre-defined charting form. In most cases, the results of the <b>scoping</b> review were used to identify evidence gaps (85  %), provide recommendations for future research (84  %), or identify strengths and limitations (69  %). We did not identify any guidelines for reporting <b>scoping</b> reviews or studies that assessed the quality of <b>scoping</b> review reporting. Conclusion The number of <b>scoping</b> reviews conducted per year has steadily increased since 2012. <b>Scoping</b> reviews {{are used to}} inform research agendas and identify implications for policy or practice. As such, improvements in reporting and conduct are imperative. Further research on <b>scoping</b> review methodology is warranted, and in particular, there is need for a guideline to standardize reporting...|$|R

[...] Episode 67, entitled [...] "Firearms Folklore" [...] (November 29, 2006) featured the test: [...] "Can a bullet travel through a sniper's scope and kill him?". [...] Using a police industry standard SWAT sniper rifle and standard police match ammunition, the MythBusters fired several shots at a <b>scoped</b> rifle mounted on a ballistics gel dummy. [...] The bullet was unable to hit the dummy: it was either stopped or deflected by the multiple layers of lenses in the scope, leaving the dummy relatively unharmed. Without any clear evidence that a bullet can penetrate a sniper scope, the MythBusters decided to label the myth as [...] "busted". But, due to much debate by viewers, it was revisited in episode 75.
