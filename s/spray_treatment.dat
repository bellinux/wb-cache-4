By using the spray method, coal-tar creosote, oil-borne solutions and water-borne salts (to some extent) can also be applied.

30|$|From the spectra, {{we can see}} the phonon signal band of GaAs IF has a high-energy {{side shift}} and shows an obvious {{variation}} in the shake peak numbers and intensity with increasing Sb spray time. Especially, the InAs/GaAs QD systems with the 15 -s Sb spray clearly display a decrease in shake peak numbers and a strengthening in the Raman intensity of GaAs IF signal. The results are assumed to originate from the Sb intermixing in the GaAs matrix, with varied compositions, stresses, and defects being manifested in the GaAs IF signal. Due to the lattice mismatch between InAs and GaAs, during the epitaxial growth, the strain will accumulate and result in the formation of lattice deformations or dislocations. These defects may be located in the InAs IF, inside the InAs QDs, or in the GaAs IF. Therefore, the up-shift, intensity, and peak number variations of the GaAs IF Raman signal can be explained in the following manner: during the Sb <b>spray</b> <b>treatment,</b> larger lattice constant GaAsSb is formed which results in reducing the QD/capping layer IF lattice mismatch. With the Sb spray time increased to 15 and 22.5  s, we can observe the obvious phonon signal for the Ga-Sb bonds located at the frequency of 230  cm− 1 [29, 30]. The presence of GaAsSb changes the stress distribution at the QD/cap IF, leading to a shift in the GaAs IF phonon line to higher energy. At a certain Sb <b>spray</b> <b>treatment,</b> the symmetry of the strain will achieve an optimum value, and the defects and dislocations will be reduced to a large degree. Furthermore, the uniformity of the GaAs IF In/Ga intermixing is enhanced. Therefore, the phonon signal peak of GaAs IF will be strengthened, as shown in the spectra; the 15 -s Sb <b>spray</b> <b>treatment</b> is just the case.|$|E

Larval mortalities caused by methidathion, permethrin, {{the highest rate of}} the nematode, and the two higher rates of fenoxycarb in the first experiment were all significantly higher than the control, with permethrin the most effective treatment.
