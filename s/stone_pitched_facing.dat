5000|$|The Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) Building of Istanbul University {{is one of}} {{the larger}} faculty {{buildings}} of the university. It is situated in the Laleli neighborhood of Istanbul, Turkey. The building was constructed between 1942 and 1944. The architects were Sedat HakkÄ± Eldem (1908-1988) and Emin Halid Onat (1908-1961). The German architect Paul Bonatz (1877-1956) also acted as an adviser during his brief stay in Turkey. It {{is an example of the}} second national era in Turkish architecture which can be described as neoclassical. <b>Stone</b> <b>pitching</b> <b>faces,</b> arcades, and colonnades are apparent.|$|R

50|$|The {{section of}} the Etheridge Railway over the Newcastle range and through the Delaney Gorge has more {{earthworks}} {{than the rest of}} the railway. The railway track runs along the north face of the Delaney Gorge and along the bed of the Delaney River for a short distance. The significant elements within this {{section of the}} railway include any <b>stone</b> <b>pitched</b> bridge piers and abutments, <b>stone</b> <b>pitched</b> culverts, and <b>stone</b> cuttings. A large <b>stone</b> <b>pitched</b> culvert is located near Native Well, east of Wirra Wirra. A bridge over Starlight Creek, just east of Delaney Gorge, has stone piers and abutments, and a small bridge just east of Wirra Wirra has stone abutments. Bridges constructed with stonework are significant due to their rarity on the Etheridge line.|$|R
50|$|From 1969-71 <b>Stone</b> <b>pitched</b> in {{the minor}} leagues, {{compiling}} a 32-24 record and striking out nearly a batter an inning.|$|R
50|$|An earlier <b>stone</b> <b>pitched</b> ramp {{remains in}} {{evidence}} {{at the side of}} the later earth-filled access to the former storage shed and wharf.|$|R
50|$|Two, {{apparently}} early, {{street lamps}} {{are located on}} the footpath {{in front of the}} shire hall. The footpath is finished with early <b>stone</b> <b>pitched</b> gutters.|$|R
50|$|The other {{rainwater}} harvesting technologies demonstrated at KVK include <b>stone</b> <b>pitched</b> contour bunds, dry rubble check dams, {{protection of}} seasonal spring by afforestation, moisture conservation pits, sprinkler and drip irrigation and {{roof water harvesting}} system.|$|R
50|$|The GCL Marlins threw a {{combined}} perfect {{game against the}} GCL Astros on July 19, 2012. Justin Jackson pitched the first six innings, Patrick Merkling pitched the seventh inning and Dane <b>Stone</b> <b>pitched</b> the last two innings.|$|R
50|$|Water was {{a problem}} {{throughout}} the Croydon Goldfield and a large dam with a <b>stone</b> <b>pitched</b> wall was constructed in 1888, by a Mr. Shoemaker (or Schumacher). Even so the Homeward Bound battery could not crush that year.|$|R
50|$|The stone-pitched ford crosses Byfield Creek in a north-south {{direction}} at {{a bearing}} of 20?. It has a rectangular frame of timber sleepers fitted together and secured by bolts, presumably iron coach bolts, {{and filled with}} <b>stone</b> <b>pitching</b> to create a causeway across the creek.|$|R
50|$|Technological {{features}} {{exist in}} the form of different road surfaces used to solve various problems encountered during construction. Surfaces include macadamised surfacing; corduroy surfacing exists in two areas, 560 metres and 765 metres west of Devil's Elbow; <b>stone</b> <b>pitching</b> exists in a number of places, many in excellent condition.|$|R
50|$|The water {{race is a}} {{rare and}} {{uncommon}} example of its type and is the longest <b>stone</b> <b>pitched</b> water race recorded in North Queensland. It is unusual in its size, ranging to over 2m in height in places and with a total extent of up to 10 km in length.|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of other {{features}} associated with the road, including stone extraction quarries, side cuttings, a system of catch drains and culverts occurring along the entire length of the roadway. Catch drains average about 50-75 centimetres in width and 20-25 centimetres in depth. Some of the drains are <b>stone</b> <b>pitched.</b>|$|R
500|$|Part of the village, {{including}} about [...] of the mound, {{have been}} subject to submergence and river erosion caused by the Ganga river. The Nonia tola in the village was in imminent danger of getting submerged. In 2010, protection of the part of the village exposed to erosion was envisaged by way of <b>stone</b> <b>pitching.</b>|$|R

60|$|We passed on, {{and emerged}} beyond the village, {{still on the}} {{descending}} great high-road that was mended with loose <b>stones</b> <b>pitched</b> on it. This wasn't good enough. Besides, {{we were out of}} the sun, and the place being at a considerable elevation, it was very cold. So we turned back, to climb quickly uphill into the sun.|$|R
50|$|Most of Gallop Botanical Reserve has open sclerophyll {{vegetation}} {{consisting of}} Melaleuca spp, Eucalypts spp (Bloodwood), Cooktown Ironwood and various grasses. The Cooktown Botanic Gardens, consisting of 3.5 hectares within the Gallop Botanic Reserve, is vegetated with similar species of native trees, but interspersed with the indigenous vegetation are formal lawned areas, <b>stone</b> <b>pitched</b> waterways and planted exotic species.|$|R
50|$|Part of the village, {{including}} about 10 m of the mound, {{have been}} subject to submergence and river erosion caused by the Ganga river.

6000|$|... "Good dog; fetch it!" [...] Blink {{backed into}} the soldiers, who, bending down, {{took her by}} head tail, threw her into the pond, and {{encouraged}} her on with small <b>stones</b> <b>pitched</b> at the hat. Having taken the plunge, the intelligent animal waded boldly to the hat, and endeavoured by barking and making little rushes at it with her nose, to induce it to return to shore.|$|R
50|$|A boiler and a {{compressor}} {{are located in}} association with shafts and workings at {{the western end of}} the place. Adjacent are the remains of two small buildings constructed with flagstone surfaces and <b>stone</b> <b>pitched</b> wall sections. The purpose of these structures is not evident, although they may have been lock-up stores. The camp comprises the remains of a corrugated iron shed and a stove and fridge.|$|R
50|$|The {{surviving}} railway buildings, rails, sidings, turning forks, cattle yards, loading banks, <b>stone</b> <b>pitched</b> {{bridges and}} culverts, stone cuttings, sandboxes, water tank, signage, and signals and points infrastructure at the Mount Surprise, Einasleigh and Forsayth railway stations {{and along the}} Etheridge Railway between Mount Surprise and Forsayth all demonstrate the principal characteristics of a railway line that was used for mining and pastoral purposes.|$|R
50|$|The railway {{stations}} at Mount Surprise, Einasleigh and Forsayth and {{the route}} of the Etheridge Railway between Mount Surprise and Forsayth, including surviving railway buildings, rails, sidings, turning forks, loading banks, <b>stone</b> <b>pitched</b> bridges and culverts, stone cuttings, sandboxes, water tank, signage, and signals and points infrastructure, are important surviving evidence of the efforts of the Chillagoe Railway and Mines Company to supply copper ore to its smelters at Chillagoe.|$|R
50|$|The {{structure}} is complex in design {{in terms of}} contours and fall. Various sections of the <b>stone</b> <b>pitched</b> wall show evidence of great effort in terms of shaping and fitting locally sourced stone to produce flat wall surfaces. Sections near the Tate River feature early examples of the concreting of stones {{to keep them in}} place as well as large sections blasted out of the bedrock to form the race.|$|R
50|$|Bower Fold in Stalybridge, Greater Manchester, England, is {{the home}} ground of Stalybridge Celtic {{football}} club. The stadium is notable for being the only ground {{in the country where}} the <b>pitch</b> <b>faces</b> a perfect north alignment, an honour the club shared with Chesterfield F.C. until their Saltergate stadium closed in 2010.|$|R
50|$|A {{natural sand}} deposit on the {{southern}} bank of the creek is encroaching onto the crossing, and plant shoots are growing between the <b>stone</b> <b>pitching.</b> The log at the southern aspect is exposed for only a small portion, less than 50 cm, the remainder being covered by encroaching sand deposits, up to an approximate depth of 20 cm. Sediment deposits currently extend to approximately 4.6m {{from the point of}} the southern sleeper into the fording.|$|R

In 1980, {{he was the}} AL Cy Young Award winner, and an American League All Star, {{finishing}} {{the season with a}} record of 25-7. He was WGN-TV's color commentator for Chicago Cubs broadcasts between 1983 and 2004, missing a couple of seasons late in his tenure due to health problems. He worked in radio until 2009, when he became the color commentator for Chicago White Sox television broadcasts.|$|R
50|$|Walkerwood Reservoir is {{the lowest}} {{reservoir}} {{of a series of}} four in the Brushes valley above Stalybridge in Greater Manchester, built in the 19th century to provide a supply of safe drinking water. It is owned and operated by United Utilities. The reservoir dam consists of a clay core within an earth embankment. The embankment was originally protected from erosion with <b>stone</b> <b>pitching.</b> At a later stage these were overlain with in-situ concrete slabs, which in turn have deteriorated over the years.|$|R
5000|$|From here, the tramway {{formation}} runs {{fairly close}} to the Herberton-Petford Road and is frequently visible, particularly for about a kilometer {{in the vicinity of}} Weinart Siding. There is <b>stone</b> <b>pitching</b> near to the road at [...] The base of a telegraph pole, broken insulators and a metal bracket for holding insulators were found nearby, between the tramway formation and the road. Small metal scatters, including rail spikes, were also found on or next to the tramway formation in this area.|$|R
