25|$|At the 2008 Esri Developers Summit, {{there was}} little {{emphasis}} on ArcIMS, except for one session on transitioning from ArcIMS to ArcGIS <b>Server-based</b> applications, indicating a change in focus for Esri with ArcGIS 9.3 for web-based mapping applications.|$|E
25|$|Modern free {{software}} and Open-source software systems {{are composed of}} software by many different authors, including the Linux kernel developers, the GNU project, and other vendors such as those behind the X Window System. Desktop- and <b>server-based</b> distributions use GNU components such as the GNU C Library (glibc), GNU Core Utilities (Coreutils), and bash.|$|E
25|$|On August 4, 2010, Google {{announced}} {{the suspension of}} stand-alone Wave development and the intent of maintaining the web site {{at least for the}} remainder of the year, and on November 22, 2011, announced that existing Waves would become read-only in January 2012 and all Waves would be deleted in April 2012. Development was handed over to the Apache Software Foundation which started to develop a <b>server-based</b> product called Wave in a Box.|$|E
25|$|Compared to <b>server-based</b> {{streaming}}, p2p-based streaming saves on data {{costs for}} the service provider, {{at the same time}} as the distribution becomes more robust, since it only grows stronger with every additional user. What distinguishes Vnet from traditional p2p is that Vnet allows an administrator to have central control over which movies are in the network and which users that can see them. Publishing into the network and access to the network is thus centrally controlled.|$|E
500|$|When first revealed, {{the game}} was {{primarily}} developed by Atlus, with the online infrastructure being developed by the Japanese company ISAO. It was classified as an [...] "online role-playing game" [...] which got round the <b>server-based</b> problems of MMORPGs by using a single server for all players. By 2005, Atlus had licensed its development to CAVE; for the game's development, a new subsidiary called CAVE Online was created, made up of former Atlus staff members. This subsidiary merged back into CAVE by September 2006 during {{the final year of}} work on the game. The total length of time in which CAVE worked on the title has been estimated as about 20 months. The game used a version of the Virtual Community Engine (VCE), a middleware engine that enabled the centralization of servers and networking, aiming for a smooth and fast running experience for players. An important part of the development process for its designers was accurately translating Kazuma Kaneko's demon designs into 3D.|$|E
500|$|By 1993, Windows {{had become}} {{the most widely used}} GUI {{operating}} system in the world. Fortune Magazine named Microsoft as the [...] "1993 Most Innovative Company Operating in the U.S." [...] The year also marked the end of a five-year copyright infringement legal case brought by Apple Computer, dubbed Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., in which the ruling was in Microsoft's favor. Microsoft also released Windows for Workgroups 3.11, {{a new version of the}} consumer line of Windows, and Windows NT 3.1, a <b>server-based</b> operating system with a similar user interface to consumer versions of the operating system, but with an entirely different kernel. As part of its strategy to broaden its business, Microsoft released Microsoft Encarta on March 22, 1993, the first encyclopedia designed to run on a computer. Soon after, the Microsoft Home brand was introduced– encompassing Microsoft's new multimedia applications for Windows 3.x., Microsoft changed its slogan to [...] "Where do you want to go today?" [...] in 1994 as part of an attempt to appeal to nontechnical audiences in a US$100 million advertising campaign.|$|E

2500|$|The client-based {{version of}} Btrieve for Windows could access <b>server-based</b> {{versions}} of Btrieve via a DOS-based [...] "requester". The requestor required {{the use of}} DOS Protected Mode Interface (DPMI) which allowed program access to DOS extended memory accessible only via the CPU's Protected Mode.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the legacy}} public {{switched}} telephone network (PSTN), wireless, and cable systems, lawful interception (LI) was generally performed by accessing the mechanical or digital switches supporting the targets' calls. [...] The introduction of packet switched networks, softswitch technology, and <b>server-based</b> applications {{the past two}} decades fundamentally altered how LI is undertaken.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "glue" [...] module, {{which is}} a DLL, is loaded into memory and becomes the {{interface}} to the MKDE. The MKDE then determines whether it is configured to be a workstation-based configuration or a <b>server-based</b> configuration. It then passes requests via its communications [...] "requester" [...] module onto the database server, or directly modifies the database files if configured in workstation mode.|$|E
2500|$|Most Opera Mini {{versions}} {{use only}} the <b>server-based</b> compression method, with maximal compression but some issues with interactive web apps. Opera Mini can operate in three compression modes: [...] "mini" [...] (or [...] "extreme" [...] on Android versions), [...] "turbo" [...] (on [...] "high" [...] on Android versions) and uncompressed. The turbo and the mini modes {{reduce the amount}} of data transferred, and increases speed on the slower connections.|$|E
2500|$|The company's history {{goes back}} to the 1980s when the first {{versions}} of Intel <b>server-based</b> voice messaging and call processing systems were released. The CallXpress product originated from Applied Voice Technology (AVT, NASDAQ:AVTC) which later became Captaris, Inc. [...] In 2003, Sound Advantage purchased the CallXpress Voicemail and Unified Messaging solution from Captaris and this merger of technologies became a new entity called Applied Voice & Speech Technologies, Inc. (AVST). The acquisition included the retention of key products and technology as well as the entire product engineering, support and sales teams. AVST was established in September 2003 by the merger of Sound Advantage (established in 1997) and the AVT division (established in 1982) of Captaris, Inc. (NASDAQ: CAPA).|$|E
2500|$|In August 2002, several ex-PGP {{team members}} formed a new company, PGP Corporation, {{and bought the}} PGP assets (except for the command line version) from NAI. The new company was funded by Rob Theis of Doll Capital Management (DCM) and Terry Garnett of Venrock Associates. PGP Corporation {{supports}} existing PGP users and honors NAI's support contracts. Zimmermann now serves as a special advisor and consultant to PGP Corporation, as well as continuing to run his own consulting company. [...] In 2003, PGP Corporation created a new <b>server-based</b> product called PGP Universal. [...] In mid-2004, PGP Corporation shipped its own command line version called PGP Command Line, which integrates with the other PGP Encryption Platform applications. In 2005, PGP Corporation made its first acquisition—the German software company Glück & Kanja Technology AG, which is now PGP Deutschland AG. In 2010, PGP Corporation acquired Hamburg-based certificate authority TC TrustCenter and its parent company, ChosenSecurity, to form its PGP TrustCenter division.|$|E
2500|$|Poor speech {{habits and}} other {{problems}} such as heavy foreign accents and mumbling complicate the process for both the MT and the recognition software. An MT can [...] "flag" [...] such a report as unintelligible, but the recognition software will transcribe the unintelligible word(s) from the existing database of [...] "learned" [...] language. The result is often a [...] "word salad" [...] or missing text. Thresholds can be set to reject a bad report and return it for standard dictation, but these settings are arbitrary. Below a set percentage rate, the word salad passes for actual dictation. The MT simultaneously listens, reads and [...] "edits" [...] the correct version. Every word must be confirmed in this process. The downside of the technology is when the time spent in this process cancels out the benefits. The quality of recognition can range from excellent to poor, with whole words and sentences missing from the report. Not infrequently, negative contractions and the word [...] "not" [...] is dropped altogether. These flaws trigger concerns that the present technology could have adverse effects on patient care. Control over quality can also be reduced when providers choose a <b>server-based</b> program from a vendor Application Service Provider (ASP).|$|E
