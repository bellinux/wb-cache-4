5|$|After long negotiations, Portugal {{signed a}} treaty with Brazil on 29 August 1825 {{in which it}} {{recognized}} Brazilian independence. Except for the recognition of independence, the treaty provisions were at Brazil's expense, including a demand for reparations {{to be paid to}} Portugal, with no other requirements of Portugal. Compensation was to be paid to all Portuguese citizens residing in Brazil for the losses they had experienced, such as properties which had been confiscated. JoãoVI was also given the right to style himself emperor of Brazil. More humiliating was that the treaty implied that independence had been granted as a beneficent act of JoãoVI, rather than having been compelled by the Brazilians through force of arms. Even worse, Great Britain was rewarded for its role in advancing the negotiations by the <b>signing</b> <b>of</b> a separate treaty in which its favorable commercial rights were renewed and by the <b>signing</b> <b>of</b> a convention in which Brazil agreed to abolish slave trade with Africa within four years. Both accords were severely harmful to Brazilian economic interests.|$|E

50|$|Ell is most {{remembered for}} his strong {{interest}} in recreation and conservation. From 1900 onwards, Ell pushed {{for the creation of}} a network of scenic reserves along Christchurch's Port Hills, linked by the Summit Road and with a network of rest-houses to allow travellers and walkers to refresh themselves. Three of these rest-houses, designed by architect Samuel Hurst Seager, were completed during Ell's lifetime: the <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> the Bellbird, <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> the Kiwi, and <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> the Packhorse. The last, and grandest, the <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> the Takahe, was not completed until long after Ell’s death, in 1949. All four houses were built of local stone, and designed to blend in with the landscape. The <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> the Kiwi and <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> the Takahe still function as commercial rest stops serving refreshments while the <b>Sign</b> <b>of</b> the Bellbird survives only as a shelter, but is still a useful stopping place for a picnic and the starting point for some short walks.
