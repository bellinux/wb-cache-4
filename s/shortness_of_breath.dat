Depending on the person, they may become worse at night or with exercise.|$|E

40|$|We {{recently}} diagnosed a {{very rare}} case of ulcerative pleurisy secondary to amoebiasis. The patient, a 49 year old male was admitted to Universiti Sains Malaysia Hospital complaining <b>of</b> <b>shortness</b> <b>of</b> <b>breaths</b> <b>of</b> a week’s duration. Clinical examinations showed features of consolidation of the right lower base and pneumonia was clinically suspected. Chest x-ray (Fig. 1 a) showed pleural effusion and on insertion of chest tube, 250 ml of pus mixed with blood was drained. Pleural biopsy was done to exclude malignancy. The histopathological examinations (Fig. 1 b) showed presence of a few amoebic parasites among the necrotic exudate of an ulcerative pleura associated with inflamed granulation tissue. The patient did not have hepatomegaly clinically and was confirmed by ultrasound. He is a known case of chronic renal failure and on regular hemodialysis. He is also a known diabetic for some years. Pleurisy secondary to amebiasis is extremely rare, rarer still when present without liver involvement. In 1962, Chest journal had a case report 1 and a short Letter to Editor communication on this disease in 19922. Unlike those cases, ours had no obvious liver source of amoebiasis {{and did not have}} right upper abdominal tenderness. He was given intravenous metornidazole and has since fully recovered. His underlying chronic immune deficient status (diabetes and chronic renal failure) are possible contributing factors to this rare presentation of a relatively common disease in the tropics. We would like to revisit this case in this short communication...|$|R
40|$|COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) is {{a serious}} lung disease which makes people hard to breathe. The {{number of people who}} have COPD is on the rise. COPD {{patients}} require lung function examinations and perform breathing exercises on a regular basis in order to be more aware of their lung functions, get diagnosed early, and control the <b>shortness</b> <b>of</b> their <b>breaths.</b> In order to help people with COPD, we developed mCOPD which is a smartphone based Android application made especially for COPD patients. COPD patients can do breathing test on mCOPD. mCOPD will automatically record test results and send data to doctors via the phone, assisting them in making diagnostic decisions. A novel game based breathing exercise system is also offered by mCOPD. We evaluated mCOPD in controlled and uncontrolled environments with 40 subjects. Deviation between the test results of using mCOPD and using a digital spirometer is about 10 %. The experimental results show that this mCOPD system is a promising application for remote medical treatment of COPD...|$|R

5|$|The {{early signs}} of AML are often vague and nonspecific, and may be {{similar to those of}} {{influenza}} or other common illnesses.

5|$|Most {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of AML are caused by the replacement of normal blood cells with leukemic cells. A lack of normal white blood cell production makes people more susceptible to infections; while the leukemic cells themselves are derived from white blood cell precursors, they have no infection-fighting capacity. A drop in red blood cell count (anemia) can cause fatigue, paleness, and <b>shortness</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath.</b> A lack of platelets can lead to easy bruising or bleeding with minor trauma.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{symptoms}} of COPD are sputum production, <b>shortness</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath,</b> and a productive cough. These symptoms are present for {{a prolonged period}} of time and typically worsen over time. It is unclear if different types of COPD exist. While previously divided into emphysema and chronic bronchitis, emphysema is only a description of lung changes rather than a disease itself, and chronic bronchitis is simply a descriptor of symptoms {{that may or may not}} occur with COPD.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} of AML {{are caused by}} replacement of normal bone marrow with leukemic cells, which causes a drop in red blood cells, platelets, and normal white blood cells. These symptoms include fatigue, <b>shortness</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath,</b> easy bruising and bleeding, and increased risk of infection. Several risk factors and chromosomal abnormalities have been identified, but the specific cause is not clear. As an acute leukemia, AML progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated.|$|E

5|$|An acute {{exacerbation}} of COPD {{is defined}} as increased <b>shortness</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath,</b> increased sputum production, {{a change in the}} color of the sputum from clear to green or yellow, or an increase in cough in someone with COPD. This may present with signs of increased work of breathing such as fast breathing, a fast heart rate, sweating, active use of muscles in the neck, a bluish tinge to the skin, and confusion or combative behavior in very severe exacerbations. Crackles may also be heard over the lungs on examination with a stethoscope.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{reactivity}} of the metal, toxicological data are available only for compounds. Water-soluble barium compounds are poisonous. In low doses, barium ions act as a muscle stimulant, and higher doses affect the nervous system, causing cardiac irregularities, tremors, weakness, anxiety, <b>shortness</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath,</b> and paralysis. This toxicity {{may be caused by}} Ba2+ blocking potassium ion channels, which are critical to the proper function of the nervous system. Other organs damaged by water-soluble barium compounds (i.e., barium ions) are the eyes, immune system, heart, respiratory system, and skin causing, for example, blindness and sensitization.|$|E
5|$|Lung cancer, {{also known}} as lung carcinoma, is a {{malignant}} lung tumor characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in tissues of the lung. This growth can spread beyond the lung {{by the process of}} metastasis into nearby tissue or other parts of the body. Most cancers that start in the lung, known as primary lung cancers, are carcinomas. The two main types are small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The most common symptoms are coughing (including coughing up blood), weight loss, <b>shortness</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath,</b> and chest pains.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} {{conditions}} associated with thrombophilia are {{deep vein thrombosis}} (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), which are referred to collectively as venous thromboembolism (VTE). DVT usually occurs in the legs, and is characterized by pain, swelling and redness of the limb. It may lead to long-term swelling and heaviness due to damage to valves in the veins. The clot may also break off and migrate (embolize) to arteries in the lungs. Depending on the size {{and the location of}} the clot, this may lead to sudden-onset <b>shortness</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath,</b> chest pain, palpitations and may be complicated by collapse, shock and cardiac arrest.|$|E
5|$|A {{pneumothorax}} is {{an abnormal}} collection of {{air in the}} pleural space between the lung and the chest wall. Symptoms typically include sudden onset of sharp, one-sided chest pain and <b>shortness</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath.</b> In a minority of cases the amount of air in the chest increases when a one-way valve is formed by an area of damaged tissue, leading to a tension pneumothorax. This condition can cause a steadily worsening oxygen shortage and low blood pressure. Unless reversed by effective treatment, it can result in death. Very rarely both lungs may be affected by a pneumothorax. It is often called a collapsed lung, although that term may also refer to atelectasis.|$|E
5|$|A small {{spontaneous}} pneumothorax will typically resolve without treatment and requires only monitoring. This approach {{may be most}} appropriate in {{people who have no}} underlying lung disease. In a larger pneumothorax, or if there is <b>shortness</b> <b>of</b> <b>breath,</b> the air may be removed with a syringe or a chest tube connected to a one-way valve system. Occasionally, surgery may be required if tube drainage is unsuccessful, or as a preventive measure, if there have been repeated episodes. The surgical treatments usually involve pleurodesis (in which the layers of pleura are induced to stick together) or pleurectomy (the surgical removal of pleural membranes). About 17–23 cases of pneumothorax occur per 100,000 people per year. They are more common in men than women.|$|E
