40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{prospective}} {{study was to determine}} the prevalence of <b>subclinical</b> <b>toxicity</b> of calcineurin inhibitors (CI) in repeated protocol renal allograft biopsies and to assess its impact on the development of chronic graft changes. A total of 424 biopsies were conducted in a cohort of 158 patients; of these biopsies, 158 were in the third week, 142 were in the third month and 124 were in the first year after transplantation. Histological signs of toxicity occurred in the third week in 33 (20. 1 %) patients, with persistence after CI dose reduction in the third month in 27 (19. 0 %) and in the first year in 23 (18. 5 %) patients. Of the toxic changes, 52 % were clinically silent. At the end of the one-year follow-up, both subclinical and clinically manifest toxicity resulted in a similar progression of chronic changes quantified by Banff chronicity score and they significantly differed from the control group (P< 0. 05). <b>Subclinical</b> <b>toxicity</b> affects a significant percentage of grafts; it occurs independently of dosage, blood level and type of applied CI. It is associated with the progression of chronic changes as early as in the first year after transplantation and represents an independent risk factor for chronic allograft damage.

40|$|A {{postal survey}} {{of the level of}} {{awareness}} of leucaena toxicity and an on-farm study of the toxicity status of Queensland cattle herds grazing leucaena were conducted to investigate the prevalence of mimosine and dihydroxypyridine (DHP) toxicity in Queensland. In total, 195 of 356 graziers surveyed responded to the postal survey. Sixty-three percent had inoculated their cattle with in vitro Synergistes jonesii inoculum (produced in an anaerobic fermenter) and 30 % of these had inoculated more than once. The remainder used inappropriate procedures. Many graziers (43 %) had occasionally observed toxicity symptoms of hair loss and poor animal growth rates. In the on-farm study, the toxicity status of 385 animals in 44 individually managed herds on 36 properties was determined by urine analysis of mimosine and DHP concentrations. No animals were experiencing mimosine toxicity, based on low concentrations of this compound found in the urine. Using the criterion that average herd urine concentrations of DHP> 100 Î¼g/mL was indicative of <b>subclinical</b> <b>toxicity,</b> 48 % of herds were exposed to <b>subclinical</b> <b>toxicity</b> due to dominant 3, 4 -DHP (21 %) or dominant 2, 3 -DHP (27 %) toxicity; many of these herds had been inoculated with S. jonesii and were thought to be protected.

40|$|Background: Recently, {{case reports}} of {{patients}} treated with imatinib (imatinib mesylate; Gleevec (R); Glvec (R)) {{indicated that this}} tyrosine kinase inhibitor may induce cardiomyopathy. Consequently, careful cardiac monitoring was advocated for clinical studies. The {{purpose of this study}} was to prospectively evaluate whether imatinib (Gleevec) induces early, <b>subclinical,</b> cardiac <b>toxicity.</b> Patients and methods: History and physical examination were carried out with special attention for symptoms of heart failure. Additionally, assessments of serial plasma N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and serum cardiac troponin T (cTnT) measurement before and 1 and 3 months after the start of imatinib treatment (400 - 800 mg daily) were done in patients with advanced and/or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST). Results: A total of 55 GIST patients were enrolled. Only one patient, with a normal pretreatment NT-proBNP, showed an increase in NT-proBNP to above age-specific normal values during imatinib treatment and developed symptomatic heart failure due to pre-existent cardiac valvular disease. cTnT levels remained stable. Conclusions: in our study population, imatinib treatment for GIST was not associated with an increase in plasma NT-proBNP levels, indicating that the risk of <b>subclinical</b> cardiac <b>toxicity</b> is limited with the use of this agent. These results do not support the current strategy to standard cardiac monitoring in all patients. This may be restricted to GIST patients with a history of cardiac disease...|$|R

One manifestation of <b>subclinical</b> <b>toxicity</b> from polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposure is {{the disruption of}} normal immune function described in numerous species, including American kestrels (Falco sparverius). In 1998, 152 mature male and female kestrels were fed either a mixture of Aroclor 1248 : 1254 : 1260 (approximately 7 mg/kg kestrel/day) through their food items, or control diets. Offspring produced by 50 breeding pairs (thus, half received in ovo PCB exposure only) were also studied. Total and differential white blood cell counts, the phytohemagglutinin (PHA) skin response, as well as thyroid hormone levels were tested in vivo in nonbreeding adults (1998 only) and nestlings (1998 and 1999).

In the auditory pathway study, four patients (12 %) had mild sensorineural hearing impairment. Two patients (6 %) had increased P 100 latencies in the visual evoked potential study, and nine patients (26 %) had abnormal electroretino-gram results. All had normal electrooculograms.

In the peripheral or central nervous pathways, seven patients (21 %) had sensory neuropathy, of which three cases were probably related to diabetes mellitus. All had normal motor conduction velocities. Four patients (12 %) had increased cortical latencies of median or posterior tibial somatosensory evoked potential.

40|$|For sheep grazing {{pastures}} {{in areas}} of mineralisation and former metalliferous mining activity, an excessive intake of potentially harmful elements (PHEs) such as fluorine (F) and lead (Pb) can result in clinical and <b>subclinical</b> <b>toxicity.</b> The prime aim of our work was to calculate the intakes of both of these PHEs by sheep grazing pastures in the mineralised/mined Peak District area of Derbyshire. The bi-monthly sampling of topsoils (0 ? 15 cm depth) and the faeces of sheep from fields at seven farms was undertaken for a 1 -year period. These samples were analysed for titanium that allowed the rates of soil ingestion (and hence also herbage ingestion since {{we assume that the}} sheep have an overall diet of 1 kg dry matter (DM) /day) to be determined. Our findings were then combined with previously published soil and soil-free pasture herbage F and Pb concentrations determined from the seven farms to calculate the intakes of both PHEs. The results show seasonal variations of soil ingestion at the seven farms ranging from < 0. 1 to 20. 1 % of the DM intake (median?=? 3 %), with the highest rates of ingestion being associated with the winter?spring (i. e. December?April) period. Our calculations show that at some farms, sheep can be exposed to dietary concentrations in excess of recommended guidelines potentially throughout the whole year, though livestock movement to less-contaminated pastures would lessen any toxic impact. Because the soil concentrations are greater than those associated with soil-free pasture herbage, ingested soils are the main dietary source of Pb and (especially) F to sheep. However, subjecting freshly sampled topsoils to sequential extraction procedures undertaken in the laboratory indicates that the majority of Pb and (especially) F may not be readily soluble in the ovine digestion system, so reducing the quantities of both PHEs available for absorption.

40|$|Amiodarone, {{a cardiac}} {{antiarrhythmic}} agent, provides greater efficacy, more convenient dosing, and produces fewer acute adverse effects {{than most other}} antiarrhythmic agents. Toxic effects do occur during chronic therapy, of which pulmonary fibrosis is the most serious. Relationships between adverse effects, serum drug concentrations and administered dose are not yet well understood. Lamellar inclusions observed in the lung with amiodarone pulmonary toxicity resemble those from damage by superoxide free radicals in paraquat-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Observation of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in patients receiving amiodarone was considered a possible source of preliminary evidence that amiodarone alters free radical metabolism. A liquid chromatographic method was developed for measuring serum amiodarone and desethylamiodarone (DEA) concentrations and access to an assay of SOD activity was attained. Thirty-one patients completed a one year prospective study to evaluate relationships between serum drug concentrations, drug effects, drug dose and erythrocyte SOD activity. Effects observed were: 6 cases of <b>subclinical</b> pulmonary <b>toxicity</b> with sustained falls in pulmonary diffusion capacity, one of which progressed to overt pulmonary toxicity after completing the study, 8 cases of enzyme elevations diagnostic of mild hepatitis, and 17 cases of abnormalities in thyroid biochemistry. Concentration response curves for the study population revealed correlations between log serum DEA concentrations, QT interval, corneal microdeposits, serum transaminases, and serum creatinine. Mean DEA concentrations were closely related to mean amiodarone concentrations and to accumulated dose of amiodarone during the one year study. Elimination half-lives of amiodarone and DEA were estimated to be 56 and 129 days respectively. SOD activity declined {{in the group of}} patients with <b>subclinical</b> pulmonary <b>toxicity</b> and fell 27 % from baseline in the patient who later developed overt pulmonary toxicity.;Results suggest that relationships exist between serum drug concentrations, accumulated dose of amiodarone, and several drug effects. Records of QT interval, corneal microdeposits and total accumulated dose may be useful aids in the clinical assessment of the adequacy of therapy and risk for adverse effects and may complement therapeutic drug monitoring. Elimination constants for amiodarone and DEA may be estimated in individual patients without stopping therapy by serial measurement of drug concentrations during the extended accumulation phase.

40|$|Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) is a {{tropical}} leguminous forage tree; when planted with companion grasses {{it forms a}} highly valuable and productive grazing system for animal production. Leucaena however contains the toxic, non-protein, amino acid mimosine. Post-ingestion, mimosine is rapidly degraded by plant enzymes and rumen microbes into 3 -hydroxy- 4 (1 H) -pyridone (3, 4 -DHP), and sometimes the isomer 2, 3 -dihydroxypyridine (2, 3 -DHP), which are detrimental to animal health. In the 1980 âs, the rumen bacterium Synergistes jonesii was found to degrade 3, 4 -DHP into harmless by-products. Subsequent inoculations with S. jonesii were found to increase animal performance and indicated {{that the problem of}} leucaena toxicity was resolved. Leucaena toxicity has re-emerged in cattle grazing leucaena pastures across Queensland. In a 2003 / 2004 study, approximately 50 % of cattle herds tested were found to have very high urinary DHP concentrations and were therefore suffering <b>subclinical</b> <b>toxicity</b> which was largely unnoticed by graziers. There is concern within the beef industry about the protection status of herds and the effectiveness of the currently recommended in vitro inoculum, especially when cattle are removed from leucaena pastures for several months. Possible factors contributing to the re-occurrence of toxicity may relate to reduced effectiveness and persistence of the current in vitro source of S. jonesii inoculum. This study investigated the efficacy and persistence of the in vitro S. jonesii inoculum to prevent leucaena toxicity on commercial cattle properties in southern Queensland. Leucaena availability, animal performance and inoculation history on each of 8 properties were evaluated. The first experiment investigated the efficacy of the in vitro inoculum. Treatments were minus/plus inoculation, arranged sequentially over time. Prior to inoculation, the presence of toxicity in 14 - 15 animals from each property grazing leucaena pastures was monitored for 10 - 17 weeks to ensure high DHP levels in urine. Paired blood (DHP concentrations), urine (DHP concentrations), faecal (% leucaena in diet) and rumen fluid samples [for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of S. jonesii DNA] were collected from each animal. Herds excreting DHP in urine at concentrations > 200 Âµg/mL were categorized as not âprotectedâ. Following inoculation, the same 14 - 15 animals continued grazing leucaena and were monitored to determine if toxicity had been controlled. Faecal delta carbon analysis revealed animals selected diets of 30 - 50 % leucaena ensuring moderate-high levels of mimosine intake throughout the trial as feed intake was adequate with animals continuing to gain weight (0. 15 - 1. 1 kg/head/day). Blood DHP concentrations were very low [at the limits of detection by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) ] and not useful in determining toxicity status of the animals. Urine DHP concentrations were much higher and useful indicators of toxicity. The efficacy of inoculation could be assessed by urine DHP analysis on two properties only, with inoculation eliminating toxicity on one property while apparently failing on the other. Remaining properties acquired DHP degrading capabilities from unknown bacteria which were slow to colonise the rumen. Real-time PCR failed to detect type strain S. jonesii DNA in any of the rumen fluid samples collected indicating populations (if present) were 20 samples per herd) are collected to minimise variability. It is recommended that the faecal NIRS method be further improved by increasing the number of paired data in the underlying calibration equations. It is anticipated that many herds grazing leucaena pastures, post-inoculation with the in vitro source of S. jonesii, may have lost âprotectionâ during periods âoffâ leucaena and may be suffering undiagnosed <b>subclinical</b> <b>toxicity</b> that may be limiting animal productivity and profitability. It is recommended that graziers: (a) periodically test their herdsâ toxicity status; and (b) and minimise time âoffâ leucaena {{to reduce the risk of}} losing viable populations of S. jonesii. Further research is required to investigate the possible reasons for the low vigour and persistence of the in vitro produced inoculum...|$|E

One rural area was chosen to act as a control. Water lead levels were also measured from the different study areas. The lead levels were measured using the inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Protein levels were determined using the Lowry method. The mean blood lead levels that were obtained for the urban areas were 0. 80 ÃÂ± 0. 69 ÃÂ¼g/dl and 0. 96 ÃÂ± 0. 98 ÃÂ¼g/dl for the rural clinic.

40|$|Antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones (FQLs) are {{commonly}} used to treat ocular infections but are also known to cause dermal melanocyte toxicity. The release of dispersed pigments from the iris into the aqueous humor has been considered a possible ocular side effect of the systemic administration of FQLs such as Moxifloxacin, and this condition is known as bilateral acute iris transillumination (BAIT). Bilateral acute depigmentation of iris (BADI) is a similar condition, with iris pigment released into the aqueous, {{but it has not}} been reported as a side effect of FQL. Iris pigments are synthesized by the melanogenic enzyme tyrosinase (TYR) and can be detected but not quantified by using slit-lamp biomicroscopy. The correlation between dispersed pigments in the aqueous and the extent of melanocyte toxicity due to topical antibiotics in vivo is not well studied. Here, we aimed to study the effect of topical FQLs on iris tissue, the pigment release in the aqueous humor and the development of clinically evident iris atrophic changes. We evaluated this process by measuring the activity of TYR in the aqueous humor of 82 healthy eyes undergoing cataract surgery following topical application of FQLs such as Moxifloxacin (27 eyes, preservative-free) or Ciprofloxacin (29 eyes, with preservative) or the application of non-FQL Tobramycin (26 eyes, with preservative) as a control. In addition, the patients were questioned and examined for ocular side effects in pre- and post-operative periods. Our data showed a significantly higher mean TYR activity in the aqueous humor of Ciprofloxacin-treated eyes compared to Moxifloxacin- (preservative free, p < 0. 0001) or Tobramycin-treated eyes (p < 0. 0001), which indicated that few quinolones under certain conditions are toxic to the iris melanocytes. However, the reduced TYR activity in the aqueous of Moxifloxacin-treated eyes was possibly due to the presence of a higher drug concentration, which inhibits TYR activity. Consistently, immunoblotting analysis of the aqueous humor from both Ciprofloxacin- and Moxifloxacin-treated eyes showed the presence of soluble TYR enzyme, thus reflecting its toxicity to iris melanocytes and corresponding to its activity in the aqueous humor. Intriguingly, none of these patients developed any clinically appreciable ocular side effects characteristic of BAIT or BADI. Overall, our results suggest that topical antibiotics cause different levels of iris melanocyte toxicity, releasing dispersed pigments into the aqueous humor, which can be measured through TYR enzyme activity. Hence, we conclude that topical FQLs may cause <b>subclinical</b> <b>toxicity</b> to the iris melanocytes but may not be the sole cause of the development of BAIT or BADI. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Thus, the target populations may have a high prevalence of blood-borne pathogens, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV).

Doses of approximately 1 [*]Ã[*] 1013 vector genomes of an rAAV 2 -chimpanzee Î± 1 -antitrypsin (rAAV 2 -cAAT) vector were injected into the portal vein of each of three HCV genome-positive (HCV+) chimpanzees and three HCV-negative (HCVâ) controls. Acute safety studies were performed up to 90 days after vector administration, along with analyses of the peripheral blood and liver tissue for rAAV 2 -cAAT genomes. Vector genome copy numbers in blood and liver tissue were similar in both groups. All animals demonstrated increases in liver and muscle enzyme levels after the pretreatment liver biopsy (5 days before vector injection) and after the vector injection. However, HCV+ animals demonstrated a substantially greater rise in aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and creatinine phosphokinase values than HCVâ animals.

A total of 35 children underwent measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and tubular function after completion of cisplatin chemotherapy. No child received ifosfamide. A clinically relevant 'nephrotoxicity score' was derived from GFR and serum magnesium. Follow-up studies were performed in 16 children at 1 year and in 15 at 2 years after cisplatin. Considerable interpatient variability in nephrotoxicity was observed. Treatment was modified in three patients because of nephrotoxicity. GFR was low in 18 out of 31 patients. Proximal nephron toxicity caused hypomagnesaemia in ten patients and hypocalcaemia in five patients. Elevated urinary N-acetylglucosaminidase excretion was seen in 22 out of 30 children, indicating <b>subclinical</b> tubular <b>toxicity.</b> Nephrotoxicity was less severe in children who received cisplatin courses at a dose rate of 40 mg m(- 2) day(- 1) than in those who received higher dose rates (P < 0. 005), but there was no correlation with total dose received.

METHODS: Plasma from nine male aluminium foundry workers with past experience of use of hexachloroethane and 18 controls (two controls per exposed case) matched for residence, sex, age, and socioeconomic status was analysed for hexachlorobenzene (HCB), (P-HCB), and octachlorostyrene (P-OCS) with low resolution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Serum samples from the same subjects were analysed for standard kidney, pancreas, and liver function variables. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the triplets retained, a non-parametric test, and linear regression were used for the analysis. RESULTS: A fourfold increase of mean P-HCB was found among the exposed subjects compared with the controls (313. 1 v 66. 9 ng/g lipid; P < 0. 01; (ANOVA model)). For P-OCS this difference was even larger (54. 6 v 0. 7 ng/g lipid; P < 0. 01). Results were still significant (P < 0. 05) with non-parametric testing. Within the exposed group there was a good correlation between the ln P-HCB (r = 0. 80) and ln P-OCS (r = 0. 91), respectively, with the cumulative number of years of exposure to hexachloroethane. No significant difference in kidney, pancreas, or liver function was found between the two groups.

The <b>subclinical</b> cardiac <b>toxicity</b> could be evaluated by dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) with exploring effective and safe doses of dobutamine. Methods: Twenty asymptomatic survivors (mean age: 19. 2 Â± 4. 0 years) treated with cumulative dose of 282. 1 Â± 125. 9 mg/m 2 of anthracycline {{were compared with}} 18 age-matched healthy volunteers. Total time completed this treatment was 10. 2 Â± 2. 2 years. This was a cross-sectional case-controlled study and patient and control groups were evaluated {{at the time of}} routine appointments. Echocardiographic studies were performed before and after each dobutamine infusion of 5, 10, 15, 20 Âµg/kg/min. Statistical analysis: Mann-Whitney U test was used to evaluate the difference between the groups. ANOVA for repeated measurements test was used to compare each measurement of control and patients groups and Bonferroni posthoc test was used for correction. Results: Hemodynamic changes are observed at the dobutamine doses of 15 Âµg/kg/min in the patient group. Before dobutamine infusion in the patient group only isovolumic relaxation and contraction times values were prolonged comparing to the control group. After the infusion of dobutamine ejection fraction, shortening fraction, left ventricular posterior wall thickening (%LVPWt), end-systolic wall stress (ESS), interventricular septum systolic thickening, left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic diameters, mitral acceleration (AT) and deceleration times values were deteriorated in the patient group compared to the control group (p< 0. 05 for all). The highest differences between the groups were observed in the %LVPWt, ESS and AT values at the end of test. Conclusion: The DSE is an effective and safe method to demonstrate the late anthracycline cardiotoxicity. Echocardiographic evaluation should be made at rest and dobutamine dose of 20 Î¼g/kg/min. In the early diagnosis of late cardiac toxicity; assessment of %LVPWt, AT and ESS values in addition to standard echocardiographic examination could be the guidance for early diagnosis of late cardiac toxicity...|$|R
40|$|Huntingtonâs disease (HD) {{is a rare}} {{neurodegenerative}} disorder with {{autosomal dominant}} inheritance, characterized by involuntary movements (chorea), psychiatric disturbances and dementia. HD is caused by an elongated CAG repeat (36 repeats or more) in the Huntingtin gene (HTT), on the short arm of chromosome 4 p 16. 3, with a prevalence of 5 - 10 per 100, 000 in the Caucasian population. A positive family history is a sufficient indication for predictive testing, according to international guidelines (1). Alleles with 36 - 39 CAG repeats have reduced penetrance and can generate both a normal phenotype, alleles with > 39 CAG copies show complete penetrance and inevitably cause, at some stage of life, the HD phenotype. Intermediate alleles (IAs) containing 27 â 35 CAG repeats does not confer an HD phenotype, however genetic, clinical and neuropathological implications has been recently discussed (2). As the CAG repeat expansion is the major determinant of age of onset (AO), here, we analyze the AO data in relation to CAG repeat number of 140 patients molecularly ascertained in our laboratory from 2005 to 2015. We divided the samples in two classes, in relationship with the CAG repeat number: the former was 40. The outcomes show {{an average age of}} 63. 85 Â± 16. 24 and 47. 26 Â± 9. 44, respectively. The analysis by paired t test confirmed that the length of the repeat is significantly and negatively correlated with AO (P< 0. 0022). Moreover, we describe the case of a young woman, 28 year old, with nervous anorexia, who inherited a normal allele from the father, HD affected, and an intermediate allele, 32 CAG repeats, from the mother, carrying both alleles of intermediate length (31 and 32 CAG), but apparently with no clinical impairments.

At least 4 years had elapsed from CNS-P (mean 11. 5 years) for all patients. Neurological history and physical examination were unremarkable; minor signs were commoner in older patients (P less than 0. 02). Psychometry yielded normal results, but individual verbal IQ generally exceeded performance IQ, with a trend to more marked differences in younger adults (P = 0. 06). EEG was scored and differed significantly from that of controls, with a tendency to more marked (but still minor) abnormalities in younger patients (P = 0. 06). Brainstem auditory evoked potentials demonstrated significant but generally minor abnormality in 24 % of patients. CT brain scan revealed widening of cerebral hemisphere sulci to greater than 3 mm in 38 % of patients; cerebral atrophy was commoner in the older group (P less than 0. 02) and those with neurological signs (P less than 0. 02).

40|$|Semi-aquatic predators such as mink {{are exposed}} to {{anthropogenic}} contaminants directly through the water and through bioaccumulation in the food chain. The biological impact of dietary bleached kraft pulp mill effluent (BKME) on mink (Mustela vison) was investigated. In a pilot study and two subchronic studies of 8 and 7 month duration, mink were fed diets containing 75 % (year 1) and 45 % (year 2) fish caught downstream of a BKME discharge point, and drinking water contained 25 % BKME. In year two, the 45 % fish diet had 15 % soft-wood run BKME incorporated into the feed. The investigation was tiered. In the pilot study, behavioural, clinical, biochemical, hematological, and pathological effects were investigated. Repeating these variables, reproductive factors were added in Year one, while in Year two, hepatic enzyme (ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) induction, cell mediated and humoral immune function, and hepatic vitamin A levels were evaluated. In vivo and in vitro immunotoxicity assays were developed for mink. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proliferation was measured in response to mitogens in vitro. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibody detection was developed for mink. Delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) tests and antibody production responses were used to measure cell-mediated and humoral immunity in vivo in the experimental mink. No adverse effects were found on behavioural, gross pathological, histopathological, hematological or biochemical variables, on gestation, kit birth weight, kit survival, libido, estrus, sperm quality or hormone levels. In the Year two subchronic study, the relative liver size was increased in BKME-exposed males. Hepatic EROD activity was 1. 8 times greater in exposed females (p= 0. 0001) and 2. 0 times greater in exposed males (p= 0. 0004) relative to control mink. No difference in PBMC proliferation was seen between the control and exposed mink {{with any of the}} mitogens used. The DTH response was impaired (p= 0. 014), while the antibody response was enhanced (p= 0. 029) in the BKME-exposed mink. Hepatic vitamin A levels were not different in the females (mid-lactation), but were significantly decreased in the BKME-exposed males (post-breeding) (p= 0. 0002). These changes represent a primary effect of bleached pulp mill effluent on the immune system, hepatic vitamin A stores, and hepatic detoxification enzyme system in exposed mink. Hepatic EROD activity provides a useful indicator for evidence of exposure to environmental toxicants in mink. The change in the immune response is occurring at the level of T lymphocyte differentiation, and therefore, affects the relative proportions of T lymphocyte subpopulations which are dedicated to cell mediated, or T lymphocyte dependent, antibody mediated immunity. Immune deviation seen in the female mink is not associated with changes in hepatic vitamin A stores, while the decreased vitamin A in the males has an unknown effect on their immune response. The biological impact of bleached kraft pulp mill effluent does not cause dramatic or <b>subclinical</b> signs of <b>toxicity</b> in exposed mink. However, the interference with hepatic vitamin A storage, and changes to the immune response, present concerns regarding long term effects on health, reproduction and longevity in exposed mink...|$|R
40|$|IntroductionBreast {{cancer is}} the most common {{malignancy}} among women with a worldwide incidence of more than 1. 380. 000 patients anually. Treatment generally includes multiple modalities, i. e. surgery, RT and systemic therapy. The indication for adjuvant RT is predominantly based on the type of surgery that is performed and the stage of the disease. RT in the post-BCS and post-mastectomy setting improves both local control and survival. The addition of the loco-regional LN to the RT target volume (along with the breast or chest wall) can influence survival rates in selected patients. However, loco-regional breast RT is technically challenging due to the complex target volume, in close proximity to the heart and lungs. Furthermore, using loco-regional breast RT, concerns about long-term cardiopulmonary side effects of RT predominate, more so since adjuvant systemic therapy is increasingly used and survival rates increase. In this thesis, we firstly aimed to investigate whether new developments in RT techniques can be engaged to improve dose distributions of loco-regional breast RT. Secondly, we aimed to get a better insight in the detection and evaluation of RT-induced cardiopulmonary toxicity. Optimization of treatment techniquesIn a first study, we wanted to develop and evaluate an appropriate 3 D-CRT technique for loco-regional breast RT. In loco-regional breast RT, the tangential breast fields have to match the anterior or oblique parasternal and supra-clavicular LN fields. Using a conventional 2 D RT technique (characterized by a standard field set-up and dose specification), the dose distribution along the matchline of different fields is often inhomogeneous. This can cause under- or overdosage of the target volume and OAR. The sub-clavicular matchline problems can be solved by using CT-based treatment planning and a modern linear accelerator, capable of asymmetric collimation to create half beams for the supra-clavicular and tangential fields. The alignment between the parasternal and tangential field is a bigger challenge. The partly wide tangent (PWT) technique is often regarded as a good solution for conformal loco-regional breast RT. In this technique, the use of a parasternal matchline is avoided by including the IM LN in the tangential fields. A disadvantage to this technique is that part of the contralateral breast is frequently included in the RT fields. To minimize matchline problems and avoid irradiating the contralateral breast, the Oblique Parasternal Photon (OPP) technique was developed. This mono-isocentric 3 D-CRT technique uses four asymmetric photon fields: 2 tangential breast fields, an anterior supra-clavicular field and a separate parasternal field, implemented as a quarter beam with the same gantry angle as the medial tangential field. We compared the OPP technique to the previous standard 2 D technique and to a conformal PWT technique. The target coverage and homogeneity was significantly improved using both conformal techniques (OPP and PWT), particularly regarding the LN PTV. Examining the OAR sparing capacities of both conformal techniques revealed that significantly better heart and contralateral breast sparing was achieved with the OPP technique. A drawback of the OPP technique is a higher lung V 20, although lung V 40 was lower and lung mean dose and NTCPÂs were comparable for both techniques. Based on these results, we support the use of CT-based treatment planning for loco-regional breast RT and we recommend the OPP technique for this purpose. The OPP technique is clinically implemented in our department and used as the standard technique for loco-regional breast RT. However, due to the large variability in target localisation and patient anatomy one technique does not apply for all patients. Therefore, the PWT technique is also used in the department as an alternative for the OPP technique for example in patients with laterally implanted breasts. For a non-negligible group of patients, an acceptable compromise between target coverage and OAR sparing cannot be found with either 3 D-CRT technique. Problems related to the RT technique become in general more evident in overweight patients and patients with an unfavourable chest or cardiac anatomy. For these patients, the use of more sophisticated techniques can be justified. In a second study, we examined whether respiratory-gated 3 D-CRT or VMAT offers a solution for breast cancer patients in whom lung or heart dose constraints cannot be met using a standard 3 D-CRT technique. In respiratory-gated RT, the radiation beam is turned on only during a pre-specified phase of the respiratory cycle. This technique is of particular interest for breast cancer patients, when used in deep inspiration. During that respiratory phase, the distance between the breast target volume and the heart is enlarged and the lung density is reduced. VMAT, a novel extension of IMRT, delivers intensity-modulated beams throughout a rotational arc and has the ability to generate highly conformal treatment plans. For fifty breast cancer patients (25 left- and 25 right-sided), 3 D-CRT plans were generated, to accomplish specific dose constraints for the target volume (breast and loco-regional LN), the lungs (V 20 < 25 %) and the heart (V 30 < 10 %). For the subset of patients not meeting these constraints, respiratory-gated (G) 3 D-CRT and non-gated (NG) VMAT treatment planning was performed. Using the NG 3 D-CRT technique, the heart or lung dose constraint could not be reached in respectively 40 % of left-sided patients and 32 % of the right-sided patients. In this proportion of patients, G 3 D-CRT and NG VMAT showed a significant reduction of mean heart V 30 and lung V 20, while maintaining adequate target coverage. Both, heart and lung dose constraints, were met in 89 % of patients with G 3 D-CRT and in 83 % of patients with NG VMAT. The largest dose reductions were obtained using G 3 D-CRT. An additional advantage of this technique is that due to the tangential beam set-up to irradiate the breast, the contralateral organs could be spared. With VMAT, heart dose constraints could not be reached in all patients. Furthermore, a high percentage of the contralateral breast and lungs were exposed to low doses, thereby potentially increasing the carcinogenic risk. Therefore, we believe that for patients in whom heart and lung dose constraints cannot be met with a standard 3 D-CRT technique, a combination with respiratory gating in deep inspiration is the best treatment option with only limited increase in complexity. Evaluation of toxicityCommon endpoints to evaluate the occurrence of RT-induced cardiotoxicity are cardiac morbidity and mortality. Clinical evaluation of cardiotoxicity is only relevant 10 to 15 years after RT. Consequently, the available data are derived from retrospective studies of patients treated with outdated techniques, exposing large volumes of the heart to relatively high doses. Modern RT techniques improve dose distributions, but studies using these techniques lack long-term follow-up. Therefore, clinical endpoints such as cardiac morbidity and mortality are not appropriate to evaluate whether cardiotoxicity is still a problem when modern RT techniques are used. Alternatively, tools for early subclinical detection of cardiotoxicity could provide information on the long-term risk of heart failure. Strain rate imaging (SRI) is a recently introduced echocardiographic technique. It has shown to detect changes in cardiac function before they are noticeable by standard echocardiography and to predict clinical outcome in different disease entities. Furthermore, SRI provides information on the regional myocardial function in contrast to conventional echocardiography that evaluates the global myocardial function. This is of particular interest when examining effects of breast RT, where usually only part of the heart is included in the treatment fields. In a first study, we investigated the use of SRI to evaluate early RT-induced cardiac changes in 20 left-sided and 10 right-sided breast cancer patients. SRI was performed before RT (baseline), immediately after RT (post-RT) and 2 months after RT (FUP). The mean dose to the left ventricle (LV) was 6. 7 Gy in left-sided and only 0. 6 Gy in right-sided patients. A reduction in Strain (S) was observed after RT in left-sided patients (Spost-RT: - 17. 6 % and SFUP: - 17. 4 % vs. Sbaseline: - 19. 5 %, p< 0. 001) but not in right-sided patients. Considering the left-sided patients only, the mean dose received by the apical, mid and basal segments of the LV was 12. 8 Gy, 5. 4 Gy and 4. 5 Gy, respectively. S was significantly reduced after RT in apical LV segments (Spost-RT: - 15. 3 % and SFUP: - 14. 3 % vs. Sbaseline: - 19. 3 %, p< 0. 01), but not in mid or basal segments. Furthermore, we observed that segments exposed to more than 3 Gy (= the median segmental dose) showed a significant decrease in S after RT (Spost-RT: - 16. 1 % and SFUP: - 15. 8 % vs. Sbaseline: - 18. 9 %, p< 0. 001). This could not be observed in segments receivingless than 3 Gy. In a second study, we investigated the use of SRI and conventional echocardiography in a larger (75 patients) and more homogeneous (receiving adjuvant chemotherapy and loco-regional RT) group of breast cancer patients having a longer follow-up (14 months). The mean LV dose was 9 Gy in left-sided and 1 Gy in right-sided patients. A decrease in S was observed at all post-RT time points for left-sided (Spost-RT: - 17. 5 %, S 8 months: - 16. 6 % and S 14 months: - 17. 7 % vs. Spre-RT: - 19. 4 %, p< 0. 01), but not for right-sided patients. No post-RT changes were observed with conventional echocardiography. Considering the left-sided patients only, the highest mean dose was given to the anterior LV wall (24. 5 Gy) and the lowest to the inferior LV wall (2. 9 Gy). S of the anterior wall was reduced after RT, (Spost-RT : - 16. 6 %, S 8 months: - 16 % and S 14 months: - 16. 8 % vs. Spre-RT: - 19 %, p< 0. 05) whereas S of the inferior wall showed no significant change. Our studies have demonstrated that changes in cardiac function occur despite modern RT in breast cancer patients. Further follow-up will clarify the clinical implication of these findings. Early detection of <b>subclinical</b> cardiac <b>toxicity</b> can be used in the evaluation of modern RT techniques or as a trigger to initiate preventive measures. The reported post-RT differences in S reduction between left- vs. right-sided patients, apical vs. mid/basal LV segments and anterior vs. inferior LV segments, suggest a relevant impact of RT dose and volume on the cardiac function. Further study is needed to find out whether a threshold dose for increased cardiac toxicity risk can be determined. Meanwhile, it seems prudent to minimize incidental cardiac irradiation whenever possible and apply cardiac sparing techniques such as respiratory gating in selected patients. Pulmonary toxicity {{is one of the main}} dose-limiting factors of thoracic RT. Several studies have investigated the occurrence of acute toxicity, i. e. radiation pneumonitis; however, data on late pulmonary damage, i. e. radiation fibrosis, are much scarcer. Breast cancer patients generally have healthy lungs and a long live expectancy, making them an interesting group for investigation of long-term pulmonary function changes after RT. We evaluated the changes in pulmonary function tests (PFT) 3, 6, 12 months and 8 - 10 years after loco-regional breast RT. This revealed that the time course of post-RT PFT changes follows a typical biphasic pattern. An early reduction in PFT at 6 months with a partial recovery at 12 months precedes a late progressive worsening in PFT up to 8 - 10 years post-RT. The initial reversible PFT changes most probably reflect early inflammatory response in the alveolar space; the irreversible late PFT reductions in turn may correspond with progressive fibrosis of alveolar septa. The most affected parameters are DLCO and TLC, with late reductions of respectively 9 % and 11 % compared to pre-RT values. The reduction in TLC is assumedly caused by decreased parenchymal elasticity in the irradiated part of the lung due to fibrosis. Furthermore, fibrosis of the alveolar septa will impair the gas exchange, explaining the reduction in DLCO. Multivariable analysis pointed out that concomitant use of tamoxifen enhanced the long-term RT-induced reduction in TLC. Late RT-induced pulmonary function reductions will probably remain subclinical in the majority of patients. However, subclinical lung damage will reduce the pulmonary function reserve and may become clinically apparent in patients with co-existing pulmonary disease or after a secondary injury. Therefore, we propose to perform baseline PFT in breast cancer patients with co-existing pulmonary disease. If the lung function is impaired, care should be taken to minimize lung radiation doses. status: publishe...|$|R
