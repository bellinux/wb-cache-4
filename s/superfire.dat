50|$|From {{what is seen}} on the TV series the {{batteries}} appear to fire {{at a rate of}} one round per rifle every 3-4 seconds, or 15-20 rounds per minute per rifle (30-40 per minute per battery). Galactica's heavy batteries are mounted in <b>superfire</b> layout on her dorsal and ventral sides. The idea of <b>superfire</b> layout is to position {{the batteries}} either elevated (one below and one above like in battleships), or so that one battery can elevate or otherwise fire over the top (superior) of the other battery. The advantage of <b>superfire</b> layout is it allows the ship to bring all its heavy batteries to bear on a target or targets within the same sector and greatly enhances its overall firepower and effectiveness. This is in contrast to the Mercury class whos guns are shown distributed along the long axis of the ship. This configuration is effective for perimeter defense but not ship-to-ship engagement. Thus a ship with its batteries arranged in <b>superfire</b> position, even though it may not have as many batteries, has substantially more firepower than a ship that does not.|$|E

50|$|With {{the advent}} of the s in 1908, the main battery turrets were {{designed}} so as to <b>superfire,</b> to improve fire arcs on centerline mounted weapons. This was necessitated by a need to move all main battery turrets to the vessel's centerline for improved structural support. The 1906 HMS Dreadnought, while revolutionary in many other ways, had retained wing turrets due to concerns about muzzle blast affecting the sighting mechanisms of a turret below.|$|E

500|$|A <b>superfiring</b> layout was {{eventually}} adopted as standard. This involved raising {{one or two}} turrets so they could fire over a turret immediately forward or astern of them. The US Navy adopted this feature with their first dreadnoughts in 1906, but others were slower to do so. As with other layouts there were drawbacks. Initially, there were concerns {{about the impact of}} the blast of the raised guns on the lower turret. Raised turrets raised the centre of gravity of the ship, and might reduce the stability of the ship. Nevertheless, this layout made the best of the firepower available from a fixed number of guns, and {{was eventually}} adopted generally. The US Navy used <b>superfiring</b> on the , and the layout was adopted in the Royal Navy with the [...] of 1910. By World War II, <b>superfiring</b> was entirely standard.|$|R
5000|$|The engines {{were part}} of the FIRE series that debuted in the Y10 in 1985 and later was used in other Fiat and Lancia vehicles. They were {{available}} in displacements of 1,108 and 1,242cc with eight valves in an overhead camshaft arrangement. The top of the line 1.4 12 valve [...] "Pratola Serra" [...] engine with 80 PS was carried over from the Fiat Bravo/Brava. Given the limited success of the Pratola Serra engine, it was soon replaced by the first so-called <b>SuperFIRE</b> engine, featuring four valves per cylinder and multipoint fuel injection. The Lancia Y was the first car to receive this evolution of the FIRE.|$|E
50|$|Serving {{with the}} Coast Squadron, Florida trained midshipmen on summer cruises, and {{operated}} {{along the east}} coast and in the Caribbean waters. She participated in the Presidential Naval Review in Oyster Bay, Long Island, held by Theodore Roosevelt on 3 September 1906, and four days later reported to the Naval Academy for regular service as a practice ship. She was placed in reserve September 11, 1906, but returned to full commission between 7 June and 30 August 1907, for a midshipman cruise, and between 21 May and 19 June 1908 for participation in ordnance experiments. These included testing the then-new <b>superfire</b> concept where turrets were mounted in line with one turret elevated to fire over the other.|$|E
50|$|This {{advantage}} can {{be demonstrated}} by OFD (Offensive Fire Distribution), the number of total batteries that {{can be brought to}} bear on a target. Galactica because her dorsal and ventral guns are in <b>superfire</b> position can bring 100% of her heavy batteries to bear. Whereas for example a Mercury class is at a significant disadvantage because her batteries are obstructed by the others to either side. Furthermore, a Mercury class battlestar is an extreme disadvantage if the target is above or below them as their OFD appears to be less than 50% as they have no dorsal or ventral batteries. With just what is seen on the TV series Galactica is fitted with eight 2-rifled batteries for 16 heavy guns in all on her dorsal and ventral sides. Simple math shows that Galactica could fire a full barrage (usually determined by one minute of continuous firing) at 15-20 rounds/minute/rifle of between 240-320 heavy rounds per minute.|$|E
