25|$|A simpler system, {{developed}} later, uses a {{concave disc}} (or {{a pair of}} them) set at a large angle to the direction of progress, that uses the concave shape to hold the disc into the soil– unless <b>something</b> <b>hard</b> strikes the circumference of the disk, causing it to roll {{up and over the}} obstruction. As the arrangement is dragged forward, the sharp edge of the disc cuts the soil, and the concave surface of the rotating disc lifts and throws the soil to the side. It doesn't make as good a job as the mouldboard plough (but this is not considered a disadvantage, because it helps fight wind erosion), but it does lift and break up the soil (see disc harrow).|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} from Variety, on {{the other}} hand, called the show [...] "loony" [...] and [...] "without a story, form, music, dancing, beauty or artistry.... It's impossible to tell whether [...] talent. [...] Maybe talent is irrelevant in this new kind of show business." [...] Reviews in the news weeklies were mixed; Jack Kroll in Newsweek wrote, [...] "There is no denying the sheer kinetic drive of this new Hair... there is <b>something</b> <b>hard,</b> grabby, slightly corrupt about O'Horgan's virtuosity, like Busby Berkeley gone bitchy." [...] But a reviewer from Time wrote that although the show [...] "thrums with vitality [...] crippled by being a bookless musical and, like a boneless fish, it drifts when it should swim." ...|$|E
500|$|The story {{tells of}} a prince who wants to marry a princess, but is having {{difficulty}} finding a suitable wife. Something is always wrong with those he meets, and he cannot be certain they are real princesses because they have bad table manners or they are too fat or thin or not beautiful. [...] One stormy night a young woman drenched with rain seeks shelter in the prince's castle. She {{claims to be a}} princess, so the prince's mother decides to test their unexpected, unwitting guest by placing a pea in the bed she is offered for the night, covered by 20 mattresses and 20 feather-beds. In the morning, the guest tells her hosts that she endured a sleepless night, kept awake by <b>something</b> <b>hard</b> in the bed that she is certain has bruised her. The prince rejoices. Only a real princess would have the sensitivity to feel a pea through such a quantity of bedding, so the two are married.|$|E

60|$|He {{worked out}} the problem, and then tackled <b>something</b> <b>harder</b> still. Not having anyone to guide him, he made {{numerous}} mistakes. But he kept on without becoming disheartened and at last the second example was solved as correctly as the first.|$|R
2500|$|Quicker than thought I {{brought my}} saber down {{with all my}} {{strength}} upon [...] head. He was moving as the blow fell, and I suppose I did not strike him where I intended, for he received a deep saber cut {{in the back of}} the neck. He fell senseless on his side, then rolled over on his back. He had in his hand a short Sharpe's cavalry carbine. I think he had just fired as I reached Colonel Washington, for the Marine who followed me into the aperture made by the ladder received a bullet in the abdomen, from which he died in a few minutes. The shot might have been fired by someone else in the insurgent party, but I think it was from Brown. Instinctively as Brown fell I gave him a saber thrust in the left breast. The sword I carried was a light uniform weapon, and, either not having a point or striking <b>something</b> <b>hard</b> in Brown's accouterments, did not penetrate. The blade bent double.|$|E
2500|$|The ode, {{like others}} of Wordsworth's poetry, was favoured by Victorians for its biographical aspects {{and the way}} Wordsworth {{approached}} feelings of despondency. The American Romantic poet Ralph Waldo Emerson, in his 1856 work English Traits, claimed that the poem [...] "There are torpid places in his mind, there is <b>something</b> <b>hard</b> and sterile in his poetry, want of grace and variety, want of due catholicity and cosmopolitan scope: he had conformities to English politics and tradition; he had egotistic puerilities in the choice and treatment of his subjects; but let us say of him, that, alone in his time he treated the human mind well, and with an absolute trust. His adherence to his poetic creed rested on real inspirations." [...] The editor of Harper's New Monthly Magazine, George William Curtis, praised the ode in his December 1859 column [...] "Editor's Easy Chair" [...] and claimed that [...] "it was Wordsworth who has written {{one of the greatest}} English poets... For sustained splendor of imagination, deep, solemn, and progressive thought, and exquisite variety of music, that poem is unsurpassed. Since Milton's 'Ode upon the Nativity' there is nothing so fine, not forgetting Dryden, Pope, Collins, and the rest, who have written odes." ...|$|E

60|$|Matt stood {{appalled at}} the {{prospect}} which the brute terms brought before him. He realized that after all there is no misery like that of want, and that yonder poor girl had chosen <b>something</b> <b>harder</b> to bear than her father's shame.|$|R
60|$|The bailiff {{turned red}} with anger at his rival's scornful words, and {{answered}} quickly: 'Next time {{you will have}} <b>something</b> <b>harder</b> to do.' And turning his back on his friends, he went sulkily home. Andras, putting the money he had earned in his pocket, went home also.|$|R
6000|$|Thou shalt do <b>something</b> <b>harder</b> still.

50|$|While it is {{theoretically}} {{possible to}} freeze a water-based paintball, the polyethylene glycol additive drastically lowers the freezing {{point of the}} mixture, making it highly unlikely to actually freeze it into <b>something</b> <b>harder</b> than a regular paintball. When introduced to a very cold environment, the paintball's shell will most likely dimple (making it less accurate) and the shell will become brittle.|$|R
6000|$|Fiorsen {{took the}} little moist hand; {{and his eyes}} passed over her, {{avoiding}} a direct meeting with her eyes. He received an impression of <b>something</b> <b>harder,</b> more self-possessed, than he remembered. Her face was the same, yet not the same; only her perfect, supple little body was as it had been. The dresser rose, murmured: [...] "Good-afternoon, miss," [...] and went.|$|R

5000|$|In an {{introduction}} to the story written for a later anthology, Le Guin said that [...] "Dowry of the Angyar" [...] was most characteristic of her early science fiction writing. She described it as the most romantic of her works, saying that she had steadily moved away from explicit romanticism. She wrote [...] "the candor and simplicity of of the Angyar have gradually become <b>something</b> <b>harder,</b> stronger, more complex." ...|$|R
60|$|Long Collins, tobacco {{messenger}} {{from the}} San Gabriel outfit, who rode with the longest stirrups {{west of the}} Mississippi, delved with an arm like the tongue of a wagon. He caught <b>something</b> <b>harder</b> than a blanket {{and pulled out a}} fearful thing--a shapeless, muddy bunch of leather tied together with wire and twine. From its ragged end, like the head and claws of a disturbed turtle, protruded human toes.|$|R
6000|$|Arthur Greatrex {{stroked the}} back of her white little hand with his, and {{answered}} gently, [...] "I hope nothing will ever arise to make the course of our love run any the rougher; for certainly we do seem to have every happiness laid out most temptingly before us. It almost feels to me as if my paradise had been too easily won, and I ought to have <b>something</b> <b>harder</b> to do before I enter it." ...|$|R
60|$|After this {{there was}} another {{interval}} of silence. Then my arm struck <b>something</b> <b>hard.</b> I put out my hand, and was overjoyed {{to find that it}} was the raft.|$|E

50|$|With {{content that}} focused {{primarily}} on environmental issues, <b>something</b> about which <b>Hards</b> felt strongly, The Planet on Sundays inaugural edition set out the newspaper's agenda—calling for a reduction in international trade, <b>something</b> <b>Hards</b> felt would lead to less environmental pollution, and arguing that the United Kingdom {{would be better off}} outside the European Union. But the newspaper was noted for some bizarre stories which had a sensationalist tone, among them a report about a jilted gorilla that had resorted to violence, and a claim that sunbathing could lead to people developing AIDS-type illnesses. Also featured was a Dan Dare comic strip by Sydney Jordan and Theyen Rich, the character having been updated for the 1990s.|$|R
