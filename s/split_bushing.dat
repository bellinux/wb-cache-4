5000|$|A bushing, {{also known}} as a bush, is an {{independent}} plain bearing that is inserted into a housing to provide a bearing surface for rotary applications; this is {{the most common form of}} a plain bearing. Common designs include solid (sleeve and flanged), split, and clenched bushings. A sleeve, split, or clenched bushing is only a [...] "sleeve" [...] of material with an inner diameter (ID), outer diameter (OD), and length. The difference between the three types is that a solid sleeved bushing is solid all the way around, a <b>split</b> <b>bushing</b> has a cut along its length, and a clenched bearing is similar to a <b>split</b> <b>bushing</b> but with a [...] (or [...] ) across the cut. A flanged bushing is a sleeve bushing with a flange at one end extending radially outward from the OD. The flange is used to positively locate the bushing when it is installed or to provide a thrust bearing surface.|$|E
5000|$|Regardless of {{the collet}} design, the {{operating}} principle is the same: squeeze the collet radially against the tool or workpiece to be held, resulting in high static friction. Under correct conditions, it holds quite securely. Almost all collet chucks achieve the radial squeezing motion via moving one or more male-female pairs of tapered (conical) surfaces axially, which produces the radial squeezing in a highly concentric manner. Depending on the collet design, it can be either pulled (via a threaded section {{at the rear of}} the collet) or pushed (via a threaded cap with a second taper) into a matching conical socket to achieve the clamping action. As the collet is forced into the tapered socket, the collet will contract, gripping the contents of the inner cylinder. (The axial movement of cones is not mandatory, however; a <b>split</b> <b>bushing</b> squeezed radially with a linear force—e.g., set screw, solenoid, spring clamp, pneumatic or hydraulic cylinder—achieves the same principle without the cones; but concentricity can only be had to the extent that the bushing's diameters are perfect for the particular object being held. Thus only in toolroom contexts, such as machine tool tooling creation and setup, is this common.) ...|$|E
40|$|New ground {{fittings}} for Space Shuttle payload handling were designed, built, {{and tested}} by Government and contractor personnel at the NASA John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Florida, from May 1981 through November 1982. Design {{evolution of the}} Space Shuttle Orbiter payload retention fittings, which contained a load-sensitive <b>split</b> <b>bushing</b> in a pillow-block housing, created an incompatibility between the interfacing ground and airborne equipment. New fittings were designed and successfully used beginning with the fifth Space Shuttle flight, STS- 5. An active hydraulic spring system containing a gas accumulator in the hydraulic system provided the load relief required to protect the Orbiter bushing from damage...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} a special bending tool which {{is used in the}} {{formation}} of $ 90 ^o$ bends for the tube-in-tube helium flow passages of a remote delivery tube is described. The concentric thin walled stainless-steel tube assembly is filled with water and cryofrozen before they are clamped into the bending tool. The tubes are bent by pressing the tube using the bending lever over the guiding wheel. The <b>split</b> <b>bush</b> and <b>split</b> cone clamping arrangement ensures that there is no movement of the tubes during the bending operation. This procedure has yielded kink-free bends with good circularity...|$|R

50|$|An {{adjustable}} {{hand reamer}} can cover a small range of sizes. They are generally referenced by a letter which equates to a size range. The disposable blades slide along a tapered groove. The act of tightening and loosening the restraining nuts {{at each end}} varies the size that may be cut. The absence of any spiral in the flutes restricts them to light usage (minimal material removal per setting) as they {{have a tendency to}} chatter. They are also restricted to usage in unbroken holes. If a hole has an axial split along it, such as a <b>split</b> <b>bush</b> or a clamping hole, each straight tooth will in turn drop into the gap causing the other teeth to retract from their cutting position. This also gives rise to chatter marks and defeats the purpose of using the reamer to size a hole.|$|R
40|$|The lipid cubic phase or in meso method {{can be used}} to set up {{crystallization}} {{trials of}} soluble and membrane proteins. The cubic phase is noted for being a sticky and viscous mesophase. Dispensing the protein-laden mesophase by hand into wells on crystallization plates has been facilitated by the use of an inexpensive repeat dispenser. However, the assembled dispensing device is prone to damage. Specifically, the delicate plunger used to dispense the viscous mesophase by positive displacement can be bent and scarred when the locking nut that fixes the plunger to the ratchet-driven dispensing mechanism is inadvertently overtightened. A defective plunger can render the device useless as a dispensing tool. More importantly, it can lead to catastrophic loss of valuable protein and lipid due to leakage when the dispensing syringe is being recharged with fresh mesophase. This note describes two types of bushings designed to protect the plunger from mechanical damage, which provide facile and reliable dispenser performance. One is a <b>split</b> <b>bushing</b> in brass and is a highly durable solution. The other is a small sleeve made from readily available plastic tubing. While it lacks durability, the plastic sleeve is simple yet highly effective, and can be replaced as the need arise...|$|E

2500|$|Polls {{basically}} involve {{taking a}} sample {{from a certain}} population. In {{the case of the}} Newsweek poll, the population of interest is the population of people who will vote. [...] Because it is impractical to poll everyone who will vote, pollsters take smaller samples that are intended to be representative, that is, a random sample of the population. It is possible that pollsters sample 1,013 voters who happen to vote for Bush when in fact the population is evenly <b>split</b> between <b>Bush</b> and Kerry, but this is extremely unlikely (p = 21013 ≈ 1.1 × 10305) given that the sample is random.|$|R

40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyThe dive {{support vessel}} Seven Havila {{is a new}} and top modern vessel with the most {{advanced}} dive system in the world. In 2011 she was awarded with the prestigious title “Support Vessel of the Year”. But modern design has their downsides, as a design often needs several versions before all the “child diseases” are gone. Onboard Seven Havila a problem was encountered in the bell handling system. They are having {{a problem with the}} port and starboard bell clump weight deployment angle. The problem is that when the clump weight is deployed before the bell, the clump weight gets a tilt up to 60 degrees. Over a period of time this will cause the guide wires and bell frame bushes to wear and will increase the amount of maintenance. The objective with this master thesis is to find possible solutions to straighten up the deployment/ recovery angle so they are sitting in the horizontal position as the design specification instructed. As a research method, experimental trials with a clump weight model have been conducted. Studies of other clump weight designs were also {{an important part of the}} research. Simple calculations have been done to give an indication of the effect of the different solutions. Several of the solutions will have a positive effect, but none of the solutions, except the use of two winches instead of one, will remove the tilt problem completely. The use of ballast weight to lower the CoG gave good results in the test trials, but because we are limited with the amount of weight we are allowed to add, we cannot expect the same effect. The use of support arms to act as a momentum counter to the tilt force gave the best results during the trials. The final recommendation is to either: 1. Expand the diameter on the <b>split</b> <b>bush</b> and to add the allowable weight of 250 kg at the bottom of the clump weight. A lower COG will counter the tilt angle while the expanded diameter will allow for more free space and reduce the amount of friction caused by the bend. 2. Install supports arms and where the remaining weight is placed at the bottom of the clump weight. The first option will require less work and is more cost effective than the second option, but the last option will give more tilt reduction...|$|R

5000|$|THE COW OF A WIDOW OF BREFFNY : In {{the ancient}} times a man {{the name of}} M'Gauran ruled in these parts. He was a cruel tyrant surely and prouder than the High King of Ireland or O'Rourke was a Prince in Breffny. He {{conceited}} for {{to build a house}} would stand to the end of time, a stronghold past the art of man to overthrow or the fury of the wind to batter down. He gave out that all the bullocks in his dominions were to be slaughtered and mortar wet with the blood of them. Evenly the cows were not spared at the latter end, the way a powerful lamentation went up from the poor of the world were looking on the lonesome fields. You that are young will be thinking the blackness of his spirit and the cruelty of his heart brought a curse on him to rot the flesh off his living bones. You will be expectant of the story of a king, and he walking the provinces of Ireland a skeleton and a warning to the eyes of man. But the aged and wise have understanding to know of the tribulation laid out for the good and the just, they putting their sorrows over them in this world where the evil have prosperity. The like will be enduring for a short space only, and a queer fate waits the wicked in the age-long hours of eternity. Proud is the tyrant and wealthy till they set him in the clay: humbled with fear is his spirit at the journey's end. There was a widow woman had her little dwelling convenient to where M'Gauran was building his castle. Gold she had none, nor evenly a coin was of silver, one cow only was her riches on the earth. (And surely them that had heart to molest her like would be robbing the dead of the raiment is with them in the grave.) Herself was more nor horrid lonesome the day she seen the creature driven from her by a man of the chiefs, he having a lengthy knife in his hand. At the fall of night a traveller came to the poor woman's cabin door. He was a bent, aged man with a sorrowful countenance on him, and the garments did cover him were rags. She invited him within, giving him the kindly welcome, and she set out what food was in the place for his refreshment. [...] "It is destroyed I am with a parching drouth is splitting my gullet," [...] says he, [...] "and I walking the mountainy ways since the screech of dawn. The sun was <b>splitting</b> the <b>bushes</b> at the noon of day, and the fury of it was eating into my skin. But no person took compassion on me at all." [...] With that the widow set a mug of milk before him, and it the last drop was in the countryside. He drank it down, middling speedy, and he held out the cup to be filled again. [...] " [...] 'Tis a heart scald surely," [...] says herself, 'that I be to refuse the request of a man is weary walking the territory of Ireland, since the rising sun brought light on his path. There is a king in these parts, stranger, and he has the cattle destroyed on the poor of the world, the way he will have a lasting mortar to his house." [...] 'Isn't yourself after giving me the loveliest mug of sweet milk ? [...] " [...] says he, like one was doubtful of the honesty of her words. [...] "The last drop was in this townland, stranger, and it is heart glad I am that it refreshed you. I had but the one cow only, the grandest milker in the land, and she was driven from me this day — up yonder to the masons are working with their shovels dripping red." [...] "I am thinking it is four strong walls in the pit of Hell are building for that chieftain's soul. Maybe it's red hot they'll be, and he imprisoned within them for a thousand years and more," [...] says the traveller. [...] "Let there be what masonry there will in the next world, the wealth of the people cements his castle there beyond. For the cow and the milk and the butter are the gold of the dwellers on the land," [...] says the widow. [...] "But let you be resting a while in this place: what haste is on you to depart?" [...] For she seen he was rising to be gone. He raised his hand in benediction, and the voice of him speaking was that sweet it charmed the birds off the bushes, the way they flew round him in the darkening night. [...] "May the blessing of the King of Heaven be upon you. May He send you a cow will never run dry, and you milking her at all seasons of the year to the day of your departure from the world." [...] With that the place was bare of his presence. He was gone the like of a spirit has power to travel the land unseen. At the morning of the day following the poor woman stood at her cottage door, facing out to the mountains are a long journey from that place. Didn't she see a great wonder: A piece fell clean from the hillside and from it came a cow, white as the driven snow, she travelling faster nor the wind. The widow seen all as clear as we do be regarding the rising of the sun in the Eastern sky. What- ever power was laid on her eyes the distance was no obstruction to her vision that day. But {{it was not until the}} creature came and stood by herself that she bethought her of the benediction of the traveller, and the cow would never run dry. That was the beast had the great renown on her: people came from every art and part to be looking on her. The milk she gave was richer nor the best of cream, and the butter off it was the best in Ireland. The day the widow died, a young child seen the white cow travelling away to the mountains. And no man beheld her more, nor evenly heard tell of the like. But the Gap of Glan confronts us to this day, and that is where the creature rose to the light of the world.|$|R
