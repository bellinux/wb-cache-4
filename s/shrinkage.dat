5|$|After the {{shakeout}} of {{the casting}} it is inspected for defects. The most common defects are misruns and cold shuts. These defects {{can be caused}} by cold dies, low metal temperature, dirty metal, lack of venting, or too much lubricant. Other possible defects are gas porosity, <b>shrinkage</b> porosity, hot tears, and flow marks. Flow marks are marks left {{on the surface of the}} casting due to poor gating, sharp corners, or excessive lubricant.|$|E

40|$|Material defects like <b>shrinkages,</b> dross, pores and chunky {{graphite}} {{are likely}} to occur in thick-walled castings and are a challenge for the foundries and their customers. These defects are mostly detected with handheld ultrasonic testing (UT) or X-ray analysis. Within a research project done at the Fraunhofer Institute for Structural Durability and System Reliability LBF, the fatigue of Dross, <b>shrinkages</b> and chunky graphite in thick-walled cast material GGG- 40 was estimated based on X-ray and fatigue tests on bending specimens. High fatigue reductions were received for the different material imperfections. Based on these impressions a further research project was executed at the Fraunhofer LBF to get an estimation of the informational value of UT in relation to fatigue of <b>shrinkages</b> in thick-walled castings of the material EN-GJS- 400 - 18 U-LT, EN-GJS- 450 - 18 and EN-GJS- 700 - 2. With the help of X-ray analysis and the UT technique Sampling Phased Array (SPA) information about geometry and density were derived for a numerical analysis of <b>shrinkages</b> in thick-walled castings concerning fatigue.

5|$|In {{permafrost}} soils with {{an active}} upper layer subject to annual freeze and thaw, patterned ground can form, creating circles, nets, ice wedge polygons, steps, and stripes. Thermal contraction causes <b>shrinkage</b> cracks to form; in a thaw, water fills the cracks, expanding to form ice when next frozen, and widening the cracks into wedges. These cracks may join up to form polygons and other shapes.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} in {{a newborn baby}} are much larger as a {{proportion}} of the body size than in an adult. For example, at age three months the glands are four {{times the size of the}} kidneys. The size of the glands decreases relatively after birth, mainly because of <b>shrinkage</b> of the cortex. The cortex, which almost completely disappears by age 1, develops again from age 4–5. The glands weigh about 1 g at birth and develop to an adult weight of about 4 grams each. In a fetus the glands are first detectable after the sixth week of development.|$|E
5|$|The {{sequence}} of events during the injection mould of a plastic part is called the injection moulding cycle. The cycle begins when the mould closes, followed by the injection of the polymer into the mould cavity. Once the cavity is filled, a holding pressure is maintained to compensate for material <b>shrinkage.</b> In the next step, the screw turns, feeding the next shot to the front screw. This causes the screw to retract as the next shot is prepared. Once the part is sufficiently cool, the mould opens and the part is ejected.|$|E

5|$|East Germany's {{communities}} had a {{much harder}} time, because the country was poorer and their government imposed severe restrictions on them. The border region was progressively depopulated through the clearance of numerous villages and the forced relocation of their inhabitants. Border towns suffered draconian building restrictions: inhabitants were forbidden from building new houses and even repairing existing buildings, causing infrastructure to fall into severe decay. The state did little but to provide a 15% income supplement to those living in the Sperrzone and Schutzstreifen; but this did not halt the <b>shrinkage</b> of the border population, as younger people moved elsewhere to find employment and better living conditions.|$|E

Between the years 1952 and 2006, the glaciers found in the Aktru Basin region shrank by 7.2percent. This <b>shrinkage</b> has been primarily in the ablation zone of the glaciers, with recession of several hundred meters being observed for some glaciers.

5|$|The {{woolly mammoth}} coexisted with early humans, who used its bones and tusks for making art, tools, and dwellings, and the species was also hunted for food. It {{disappeared}} from its mainland range {{at the end}} of the Pleistocene 10,000 years ago, most likely through climate change and consequent <b>shrinkage</b> of its habitat, hunting by humans, or a combination of the two. Isolated populations survived on St. Paul Island until 5,600 years ago and Wrangel Island until 4,000 years ago. After its extinction, humans continued using its ivory as a raw material, a tradition that continues today.

Experimental tests with gravity die casting of AlSi 8 Cu 3 and AlSi 10 Mg alloys have confirmed that the effect of the agent can be of advantage in foundry practice, leading to the production of castings without local concentrations of defects and without the appearance of <b>shrinkages</b> and macroscopic gas pores.

5|$|There {{had been}} {{criticism}} of MIS companies generally, and Great Southern Group (as the largest {{company in the}} sector) in particular, suggesting that their appetite for land for plantations and agribusiness was driving up land prices in some regions, and distorting some commodity markets. In 2004, Great Southern's leading competitor Timbercorp reported a rise in plantation land prices from around A$3,000 to around A$6,000 per hectare in just five years. The high demand for forestry MIS schemes led to plantations being expanded on to less suitable land, with timber growth and yield then falling below projections that were based on better quality plantations. Some farmers claimed that MIS were driving up prices in agricultural water markets. Opinion was also divided about whether the expansion of MIS properties in a region was causing <b>shrinkage</b> of towns or was, conversely, stimulating employment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Shrinkage</b> defects {{can occur}} when {{standard}} feed metal {{is not available}} to compensate for <b>shrinkage</b> as the thick metal solidifies. <b>Shrinkage</b> defects can be split into two different types: open <b>shrinkage</b> defects and closed <b>shrinkage</b> defects. Open <b>shrinkage</b> defects {{are open to the}} atmosphere, therefore as the <b>shrinkage</b> cavity forms air compensates. There are two types of open air defects: pipes and caved surfaces. Pipes form at the surface of the casting and burrow into the casting, while caved surfaces are shallow cavities that form {{across the surface of the}} casting.|$|E
25|$|<b>Shrinkage</b> and {{swelling}} may occur in wood when the moisture content is changed (Stamm, 1964). <b>Shrinkage</b> occurs as moisture content decreases, while swelling takes place when it increases. Volume {{change is not}} equal in all directions. The greatest dimensional change occurs in a direction tangential to the growth rings. <b>Shrinkage</b> from the pith outwards, or radially, is usually considerably less than tangential <b>shrinkage,</b> while longitudinal (along the grain) <b>shrinkage</b> is so slight as to be usually neglected. The longitudinal <b>shrinkage</b> is 0.1% to 0.3%, in contrast to transverse shrinkages, which is 2% to 10%. Tangential <b>shrinkage</b> is often about twice as great as in the radial direction, although in some species it is as much as five times as great.

40|$|It is very {{important}} that the dimensional changes of the fabrics of the textile materials such as fabrics remain in limits after washing. Especially at the export markets the dimensional stability is the most important factor of quality. Therefore; some standarts regarding the dimensional changes which can occur during washing for the knitted and woven fabrics had been agreed in the world and also in our country. When mentioning about &quot;the dimensional changes after washing&quot; we usually think of the length <b>shrinkages</b> or shortening which the fabric is mostly stretched on the length dırectıon.

Based on the same SWF project, the prior study of shapeable stretch textiles has illuminated that shaped woven textiles could be produced by designing different simple weaves and utilizing their distinct <b>shrinkages.</b> For more creative and expressive requirements in fashion design, two types of main compound weaves, i. e., the weft-backed weaves and the self-stitched double weaves, are explored in this study. The structural characteristics and design parameters of the two compound weaves are discussed. The experimental results revealed certain correlations between the design parameters of the compound weaves and the full <b>shrinkages</b> of stretch fabrics. The specimens employing compound weaves exhibit distinctive dimensional and textual attributes, as well as applications in fashion.

Using Monte Carlo simulations we will develop an algorithm that calculates the expected out-of-sample performance of any portfolio rule.

40|$|In {{the present}} {{world with the}} {{increasing}} use of Aluminium alloy wheels in automotive industry the Aluminium foundry industry had to focus {{on the quality of the}} products. The quality of a foundry industry can be increased by minimizing the casting defects during production. Aim of the current study is to study the production line of an aluminum alloy wheel manufacturing industry and to improve the quality of production using quality control tools. This study shows the systematic approach to find the root cause of a major defects in aluminium castings using defect diagnostic approach as well as cause and effect diagram. Casting defect analysis is carried out using techniques like historical data analysis, cause-effect diagrams, design of experiments and root cause analysis. Data from X-ray inspection (Radiographic Inspection) have been collected along with the production parameter data. Using check sheets data has been collected and all the defects have been studied. Using Pareto chart major defects in the aluminium castings were noted. The major defects for the rejections during production were identified as <b>shrinkages,</b> inclusions, porosity/gas holes and cracks. Each defect is studied thoroughly and the possible causes for the defects are shown in Fishbone Diagrams (Cause Effect Diagrams). As the <b>shrinkages</b> mainly occur due to lack of feedability during the fluid flow the stalk changing frequency is noted along with the <b>shrinkages</b> defects and a relation is drawn between them. As hydrogen forms gas holes and porosity in the aluminium castings the amount of hydrogen present in the molten metal is studied by finding specific gravity of the samples collected. The molten metal temperature effects the amount of the hydrogen absorbed by it.. So the effect of molten metal temperature on the specific gravity of the sample collected have been shown in a graph and the optimum value for molten metal temperature was found out...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiments}} {{performed in}} this work {{made it possible to}} collect positive indications concerning the possibilities of the thermal transformation of natural zeolitized materials and powder-like industrial wastes into ceramics. The structural evolution at temperatures higher than 1000 °C results in the thermal collapse {{of the structure of the}} zeolitic components which gives rise to prevailingly amorphous products. Scant crystals of phases exhibiting high thermal stability, such as feldspar, augite and quartz, are dispersed in such amorphous matrix which is mostly composed of silica, alumina and iron oxide. The thermal treatment brings to final products similar to traditional ceramics characterised by good densification and good mechanical properties but also evidenced some difficulties and problems which require further reflections. Nevertheless the high values of linear <b>shrinkages</b> recorded {{in this work}} seem to strongly hinder the thermal transformation of this powder-like waste into ceramics.
