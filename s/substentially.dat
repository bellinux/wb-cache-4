Said device (ES) comprises a reconfigurable current mirror (MC) which is provided with n outputs (K'i) connectable to said n cathodes (Ki), respectively and supplies to the n (K'i) outputs n complementary fractions of a control current having respective selected values which are substantially constant at the control current amplitude variation in order to carry out a <b>substentially</b> constant spatial location of stimulation...|$|E
40|$|Multicast/broadcast is an {{important}} service primitive in networks. The IEEE 802. 11 multicast/broadcast protocol {{is based on the}} basic access procedure of Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA). This protocol does not provide any media access control (MAC) layer recovery on multicast/broadcast frames. As a result, the reliability of the multicast/broadcast service is reduced due to the increased probability of lost frames resulting from interference or collisions. In this paper, we propose a reliable Batch Mode Multicast MAC protocol, BMMM, which <b>substentially</b> reduces the number of contention phases, thus considerably reduces the time required for a multicast/broadcast. We then propose a Location Aware Multicast MAC protocol, LAMM, that uses station location information to further improve upon BMMM. Extensive analysis and simulation results validate the reliability and efficiency of our multicast MAC protocols. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} {{a recipe for}} CP-violation will be {{demonstrated}} step by step. The first step is an analyzation of the general pattern of Yukawa couplings between quarks and the Higgs doublet. That pattern is <b>substentially</b> simplified down to a manageable level with an assumption of hermiticity of the quark mass matrix. Thus, eigenvalues and eigenvectors are analytically derived and the unitary transformation thus derived depends only on two parameters. That leads to complex CKM elements which indicate the breaking of CP symmetry. However, there are some imperfections in the derived CKM elements which make their fittings with empirical values as poor as O(10 ^- 2). The second step is to phenomenologcally employ some fine-tunning parameters which may fit all amplitudes of CKM elements as good as O(10 ^- 4). The third step is a numerical fitting of amplitudes of the CKM elements through which their phases are predicted. Thus, a way to break CP symmetry in electro-weak interactions is achieved.

40|$|The inverse {{relationship}} {{that exists between}} thyroxine and the vitamin A level of plasma has been examined in chicken. Thyroxine treatment leads to {{a decrease in the}} level of vitamin A carrier proteins, retinol-binding protein and prealbumin- 2 in plasma and liver. There is an accumulation of vitamin A in the liver, with a greater proportion of vitamin A alcohol being present compared to that of control birds. In thyroxine treatment there is enhanced plasma turnover of retinol-binding protein and prealbumin- 2, while their rates of synthesis are marginally increased. Amino acid supplementation partially counteracts effects of thyroxine treatment. Amino acid supplementation of thyroxine-treated birds does not alter the plasma turnover rates of retinol-binding protein and prealbumin- 2 but increases <b>substentially</b> their rates of synthesis. The release of vitamin A into circulation is interfered with in hyperthyroidism due to inadequate availability of retinol-binding protein being caused by enhanced plasma turnover rate not compensated for by synthesis...|$|E
40|$|A system put {{in contact}} with a large heat bath {{normally}} thermalizes. This means {{that the state of}} the system approaches an equilibrium state, the latter depending only on macroscopic characteristics of the bath (e. g. temperature), but not on the initial state of the system. The above statement is the cornerstone of the equilibrium statistical mechanics; its validity and its domain of applicability are central questions in the studies of the foundations of statistical mechanics. In the present paper we concentrate on one aspect of thermalization, namely, on the system initial state independence (ISI) of the equilibrium state. A necessary condition for the system ISI is derived in the quantum framework. We use the derived condition to prove the absence of the system ISI in a specific model. Namely, we consider a single spin coupled to a large bath, the interaction being of a specific form. Although the model under consideration is nontrivial enough to exhibit the decoherence and the approach to equilibrium, the derived necessary condition is not fulfilled and thus the equilibrium state depends on the initial state of the spin. Comment: v. 2 : The paper is <b>substentially</b> revised. Additional results are presented. The discussion of an exactly solvable model is added, the numerical calculations are removed; v. 3 : minor improvement...|$|E
40|$|There {{are a lot}} of {{problems}} which computers solve quicker and better than humans, {{but there is also a}} varietz {{of problems}} at which humans are <b>substentially</b> better. For solving such problems we use intelligent systems. The intelligent system lifecycle consists of three basic phases, which are knowledge acquisition phase, the same does not hold for the other two phases. Even more, the developers are doing a lot of unnecessary work in those phases, repeating the work, which has already been done successfully. That causes a longer development time and poor-quality products. The aforementioned deficiencies can be eliminated to a certain degree, using approaches that are already well established in the field of object tehnologies. Knowing that, led us to design and construct a tool, which uses these approaches to support the construction and use phases of inteliigent systems' life cycle. The tool was named Vega, after the renowned Slovene mathematician. In the construction phase, Vega allows knowledge worker to integrate the knowledge, obtained in the knowledge acquisition phase, into a ready-to-use intelligent system. In the later phase Vega acts as a host, allowing outer entities to access adn execute hosted intelligent systems. The user can access the intelligent systems via different user applications, whereas other applications can make use of the same functionalities via application interface. It has a form of a web service and as such enables platform independency. There is no well-known system of criteria, upon which Vega could be evaluated. Therefore we decided to try it in practice. The case included a design and implementation of threeintelligent systems in Vega to assist BITOLA system at several tasks. BITOLA is a discovery support system. Its discovery algorithm searches for not yet discovered links between different biomedical terms via text mining scientific articles database. For more accurate results the concepts are limited to the gene region. The gene symbols, used in this process, are very ambigious and therefore some of the results are always useless. We developed three intelligent systems in Vega that assist BITOLA at the task gene symbol disambiguation and therefore improve the quality of the BITOLA's services. Using Vega, the whole intelligent system development process was simple and therefore faster. On that basis we are able to conclude that the use of Vega had paid out...|$|E
