5000|$|An impulse {{response}} is {{a recording of}} the reverberation that is caused by an acoustic space when an ideal impulse is played. However, an ideal impulse is a mathematical construct, and cannot exist in reality, {{as it would have}} to be infinitesimally narrow in time. Therefore, approximations have to be used: the sound of an electric spark, starter pistol shot or the bursting of a balloon, for instance. A recording of this approximated ideal impulse may be used directly as an {{impulse response}}. Techniques involving <b>starter</b> <b>pistols</b> and balloons are sometimes referred to as transient methods, and the response is contained at the beginning of the recording in an impulse.|$|E

40|$|A. 22 or. 32 caliber {{starter pistol}} is {{commonly}} used in athletic events to generate a loud impulse signaling participants that the event (i. e. race) has started. Studies have been undertaken investigating <b>starter</b> <b>pistols</b> and the advantages introduced to athletes closer to the source, and also the negative image of having guns around teenagers at high school track and field events. However, {{there have been no}} published studies evaluating the noise levels generated by <b>starter</b> <b>pistols.</b> In this paper, impulses generated from a typical. 22 caliber starter pistol firing blanks will be compared to impulses generated from a. 22 revolver firing both black powder blanks and standard velocity projectiles. Also, results from a. 32 caliber starter pistol will also be used for comparison. Preliminary findings on this topic were presented at NHC...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveThis study {{describes}} signals generated by. 22 and. 32 caliber <b>starter</b> <b>pistols</b> in {{the context}} of noise-induced hearing loss risk for sports officials and athletes. DesignAcoustic comparison of impulses generated from typical. 22 and. 32 caliber <b>starter</b> <b>pistols</b> firing blanks were made to impulses generated from comparable firearms firing both blanks and live rounds. Acoustic characteristics are described in terms of directionality and distance from the shooter in a simulated outdoor running track. Metrics include peak sound pressure levels (SPL), A-weighted equivalent 8 -hour level (LeqA 8), and maximum permissible number of individual shots, or maximum permissible exposures (MPE) for the unprotected ear. ResultsStarter pistols produce peak SPLs above 140 dB. The numbers of MPEs are as few as five for the. 22 -caliber starter pistol, and somewhat higher (22 ̆ 030425) for the. 32 -caliber pistol. ConclusionThe impulsive sounds produced by <b>starter</b> <b>pistols</b> correspond to MPE numbers that are unacceptably small for unprotected officials and others in the immediate vicinity of the shooter. At the distances included in this study, the risk to athletes appears to be low (when referencing exposure criteria for adults), but the sound associated with the starter pistol will contribute to the athlete 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s overall noise exposure.
