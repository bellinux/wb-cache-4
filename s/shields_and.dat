5|$|The Grangegorman killings {{were the}} {{homicide}} on 6 March 1997 of Sylvia <b>Shields</b> <b>and</b> Mary Callinan, patients at St Brendan's Psychiatric Hospital in Grangegorman, Dublin, Ireland.

In his statement to the Garda Síochána (police), Lyons gave details that would only be known to the murderer or to the investigators. After Lyons was charged, Mark Nash confessed to the killings, but later retracted his confession. In April 2015, Nash's trial {{for the murder of}} <b>Shields</b> <b>and</b> Callinan began after an unsuccessful attempt to prevent the trial from going forward.|$|E

5|$|For {{personal}} protection, most Roman troops wore metal {{body armour}} (usually {{in the form}} a chain mail cuirass) and helmets, in addition to shields. In contrast, among the Alamanni, metal armour and helmets were probably owned {{by members of the}} social elite only. Most Alamanni foot soldiers had only <b>shields</b> <b>and</b> no metal armour or helmets.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to basic troops, there are Hunters, or Mgalekgolo, (from the planet Te) who according to Bungie's mythology are collectives of worm-like aliens, singularly known as Lekgolo, encased in tough armor. Initial concepts were less humanoid-looking and softer than the final shape, with angular <b>shields</b> <b>and</b> razor-sharp spines.|$|E

5|$|Scales in {{the central}} or throat region, which are {{in contact with the}} first ventral scales of a snake's body and are flanked by the chin shields, are called gular scales.

5|$|The West and East Wing {{date from}} the 1860s and are built from brick and stone. They had a lines of gun positions, each {{designed}} to hold a heavy gun and a crew of up to 12 men. The positions were protected by granite-fronted casemates and wrought-iron <b>shields,</b> <b>and,</b> with removable window screens, doubled as living accommodation for the crews. Small magazines were positioned behind the lines of casemates.|$|E
5|$|They fought as hoplites, usually {{carrying}} clipei, large round Greek <b>shields,</b> <b>and</b> wearing bronze helmets, {{often with}} a number of feathers fixed onto the top to increase stature.

5|$|As for the Harii, {{quite apart}} from their strength, which exceeds {{that of the other}} tribes I have just listed, they pander to their innate savagery by skill and timing: with black <b>shields</b> <b>and</b> painted bodies, they choose dark nights to fight, and by means of terror and shadow of a ghostly army they cause panic, since no enemy can bear a sight so {{unexpected}} and hellish; in every battle the eyes are the first to be conquered.|$|E

5|$|In 1827 the Friars Goose Chemical Works {{was opened}} by Anthony Clapham. In 1834 a second large {{chemical}} works {{was established by}} Hugh Lee Pattinson, John Lee and George Burnett; it soon employed around 300 men. Grindstone quarries produced high quality stone and a brownware pottery under Mr. Joseph Wood had opened for business.

50|$|Two {{theoretical}} reactor concepts {{were presented}} by Tom McGuire in 2015. An ideal configuration weighing 200 metric tons with 1 meter of cryogenic radiation <b>shielding</b> <b>and</b> 15 Tesla Magnets.

40|$|A {{process for}} making RF {{shielded}} cable connector assemblies {{and the resulting}} structures is described. The process basically consists of potting wires of a shielded cable between the cable <b>shield</b> <b>and</b> a connector housing to fill in, support, regidize, and insulate the individual wires contained in the cable. The formed potting is coated with an electrically conductive material so as to form an entirely encompassing adhering conductive path between the cable <b>shield</b> <b>and</b> the metallic connector housing. A protective jacket is thereby formed over the conductive coating between the cable <b>shield</b> <b>and</b> the connector housing...|$|R
5|$|In 1880 he {{designed}} an electric lighting project for Barcelona's Muralla de Mar, or seawall, {{which was not}} carried out. It consisted of eight large iron streetlamps, profusely decorated with plant motifs, friezes, <b>shields</b> <b>and</b> names of battles and Catalan admirals. The same year he participated in the competition {{for the construction of}} the San Sebastián social centre (now town hall), won by Luis Aladrén Mendivi and Adolfo Morales de los Ríos; Gaudí submitted a project that synthesised several of his earlier studies, such as the fountain for the Plaça Catalunya and the courtyard of the Provincial Council.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, {{following}} the accession of George V, the florin regained the <b>shields</b> <b>and</b> sceptres design {{it had in}} the late Victorian Era, and kept that motif until 1937, when the national emblems were placed on it. The florin retained such a theme for the remainder of its run, though a new design was used from 1953, {{following the}} accession of Elizabeth II. In 1968, prior to decimalisation, the Royal Mint began striking the ten pence piece. The old two shilling piece remained in circulation until the ten pence piece was made smaller, and earlier coins, including the florin, were demonetised.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} Camillan system of {{organisation}} of the 3rd and 4th centuries BC, men were sorted into classes based on wealth, the principes being the wealthiest after the triarii. Principes were armed with short spears, or hastae, up to 1.8metres (6ft) long. They fought in a quincunx formation, usually carrying scuta, large rectangular <b>shields,</b> <b>and</b> bronze helmets, {{often with a}} number of feathers fixed onto the top to increase stature. They wore heavier armour types, the most common form being chainmail, which offered a good degree of protection without hindering movement.|$|E

5|$|Mycenaean armies shared several common {{features}} with other significant Late Bronze Age powers: they were initially based on heavy infantry, which bore spears, large <b>shields</b> <b>and,</b> in some occasions, armor. Later in the 13th century BC, Mycenaean warfare underwent major changes both in tactics and weaponry. Armed units became more uniform and flexible, while weapons became smaller and lighter. The spear remained the main weapon among Mycenaean warriors until {{the collapse of}} the Bronze Age, while the sword played a secondary role in combat.|$|E
5|$|Numerous weapons may {{be picked}} up during a race by flying over different-coloured weapon pads. Yellow pads equip the player with {{offensive}} weaponry to destroy other racers and green pads provide defensive weapons such as mines, <b>shields</b> <b>and</b> speed boosts. Game modes carried over from Wipeout HD include one-on-one races, tournaments, time trials, speed laps, and Zone mode. The latter mode revolves around survival as the player's ship automatically accelerates to extreme speeds.|$|E
