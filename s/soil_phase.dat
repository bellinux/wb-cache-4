50|$|The soil vapor {{extraction}} remediation technology uses vacuum blowers and extraction wells {{to induce}} gas {{flow through the}} subsurface, collecting contaminated soil vapor, which is subsequently treated aboveground. SVE systems can rely on gas inflow through natural routes or specific wells may be installed for gas inflow (forced or natural). The vacuum extraction of soil gas induces gas flow across a site, increasing the mass transfer driving force from aqueous (soil moisture), non-aqueous (pure phase), and solid (<b>soil)</b> <b>phase</b> into the gas phase. Air flow across a site is thus a key aspect, but soil moisture and subsurface heterogeneity (i.e., a mixture of low and high permeability materials) can result in less gas flow across some zones. In some situations, such as enhancement of monitored natural attenuation, a passive SVE system that relies on barometric pumping may be employed.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{report on}} the results of a 40 week study in which the {{biodegradation}} of 16 US EPA polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was followed in microcosms containing soil of high organic carbon content (11 %) in the presence and absence of lead and cadmium co-contaminants. The total spiked PAH concentration was 2166 mg/kg. Mercury amendment was also made to give an abiotic control. A novel kinetic model has been developed to explain the observed biphasic nature of PAH degradation. The model assumes that PAHs are distributed across <b>soil</b> <b>phases</b> of varying degrees of bioaccessibility. The results of the analysis suggest that overall percentage PAH loss is dependent on the respective rates at which the PAHs (a) are biodegraded by soil microorganisms in pore water and bioaccessible <b>soil</b> <b>phases</b> and (b) migrate from bioaccessible to non-bioaccessible <b>soil</b> <b>phases.</b> In addition, migration of PAHs to non-bioaccessible and non-Soxhlet-extractable <b>soil</b> <b>phases</b> associated with the humin pores gives rise to an apparent removal process. The presence of metal co-contaminants shows a concentration dependent inhibition of the biological degradation processes that results in a reduction in overall degradation.

40|$|A {{soil with}} a {{relatively}} high Fe content (2. 82 % [w/w]) was loaded for up to one year with As(v) by equilibrating it with a solution containing 1000 mg l(- 1) As(v) at a soil mass-to-solution ratio of 0. 1 kg l(- 1). The incorporation of As(v) into the soil and its distribution over the soil phases were monitored by sampling at strategic time intervals using an operationally defined five-step sequential extraction procedure (Wenzel et al., Anal. Chim. Acta, 2001, 436, 309) and subsequent As measurement. A multiple kinetic Langmuir model was developed to retrieve the dynamic parameters (adsorption and desorption rate constants, capacities and Langmuir equilibrium constants) {{for each of the}} soil phases by numerical fitting of the experimental adsorption data to the model. Under the equilibration conditions used the adsorption rate constants for all five operationally defined soil phases were very similar but the desorption rate constants decreased by a factor of ca. 150 from <b>soil</b> <b>phase</b> 1 (non-specifically sorbed As) to 5 (residual phases). This implies that As(v) incorporation "deeper" into the soil leads to stronger binding which is associated with the Langmuir equilibrium constants (adsorption rate constants/desorption rate constants). Equilibration of the soil with As(v) was complete in ca. 10 days with As(v) predominantly bound to <b>soil</b> <b>phase</b> 2 (specifically sorbed As) and <b>soil</b> <b>phase</b> 3 (amorphous and poorly crystalline hydrous oxides). X-Ray absorption spectroscopy techniques revealed that these binding characteristics may be related to adsorption of As(v) on Si- and/or Al-containing structures and natural hydrous iron oxide (HFO) surface sites, respectively. Since the model is independent of the initial As(v) concentration in the solution and the soil mass-to-solution ratio, the behaviour of the thus characterized soil-As(v) system can be predicted for a range of conditions. Simulations showed that in an accidental As(v) spill the soil studied would actively scavenge As(v) by instantaneous adsorption onto all soil phases followed by redistribution of As(v) from weaker binding sites to stronger ones over time...|$|E

40|$|The {{acetylene}} reduction assay for {{the measurement}} of N 2 fixation in a water-saturated paddy soil {{is limited by the}} slow diffusion of acetylene and ethylene. In laboratory incubation tests, vigorous shaking after the assay period is needed to release ethylene into the gas within the assay vials.

In field assays, some amounts of ethylene remain in the water-saturated <b>soil</b> <b>phase</b> of the acetylene reduction assay chamber, but stirring the water-saturated soil before sampling reduces the amount of ethylene remaining in soil. Evidence of a downward movement of acetylene and an upward movement of ethylene through rice plants was obtained.

The non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) and <b>soil</b> <b>phases</b> were the dominant partition media for the contaminants in each biopile and the contaminants differed markedly in their individual fugacities. Comparison of three soils with different percentage of organic carbon (% org C) showed that the % org C influenced contaminant partitioning behaviour. While benzene showed an aqueous concentration worthy of note for leachate control during biopiling, other organic chemicals showed that insignificant amount of chemicals leached into the water, greatly reducing the potential extent of groundwater contamination. Level II fugacity model showed that degradation was the dominant removal process except for benzene. In all three biopile systems, the rate of degradation of benzo(a) pyrene was low, requiring more than 12 years for soil concentrations from a spill of about 25 kg (100 mol) to {{be reduced to a}} concentration of 0. 001 mu g g(- 1). The removal time of 1 -methylphenanthrene and either anthracene or phenanthrene was about 1 and 3 years, respectively. In contrast, benzene showed the highest degradation rate and was removed after 136 days in all biopile systems. Overall, this study confirms the association of risk critical contaminants with the residual saturation in treated soils and reinforces the importance of accounting for the partitioning behaviour of both NAPL and <b>soil</b> <b>phases</b> during the risk assessment of oil-contaminated sites.

The study of structural organization in different soil samples and <b>soil</b> <b>phases</b> saturated with Cu 2 + and Zn 2 + ions by using XANES allowed determining the mechanism of their interaction with <b>soil</b> <b>phases</b> and all the chemical bindings taken place {{in the course of this}} process. Changes in the structure of the metal ion, in particular breakdown of the symmetry of electron orbits of atoms, take place due to interaction with soil components. Application of this method demonstrated that the state of copper and zinc introduced in chernozem as oxides did not change after one year of incubation. Copper is absorbed after being introduced as soluble salts, and copper ions are incorporated in the octahedral and tetrahedral sites of minerals and bonded with humic materials at the expense of covalent bond and the formation of coordination humate copper complexes. Zinc included into octahedric structures of layered minerals and hydro(oxides) can be inner-and outer-sphere adsorbed. It is shown that the action of the metal bound to soil components becomes weakened in case of increasing the Cu and Zn load (from 2000 to 10000 mg/kg) especially applied in the form of soluble salts. Extractive fractionation of metal compounds in chernozem samples, artificially contaminated with copper and zinc salts serves as evidence of absorbing the applied Cu 2 + ions by the soil organic matter and Zn 2 + ions – by silicates, carbonates, and Fe-Mn oxides...|$|R

Significant amounts of trace metals (Cu, Cr, Co, Ni and Pb) and REE are released during anoxic incubation of the wetland soil, concomitantly with the build-up of high concentrations of Fe(II) and dissolved organic matter (DOM). Rare earth element patterns obtained in the soil solution exhibit a middle rare earth elements (MREE) downward concavity. The REE pattern obtained from field samples yields the same feature as developed in the soil solution from an oxic incubation experiment at pH 7 designed to promote soil OM desorption. By contrast, significantly different REE patterns are obtained in incubation experiments designed to promote chemical reduction of Fe-oxyhydroxides in soils. The REE pattern displays a continuous REE enrichment from La to Lu. These distinct and recognizable REE signatures allow us to conclude that (i) soil organic matter is the main source of REE and trace metals during wetland soil reduction; (ii) Fe(II) is provided by the reduction of amorphous Fe(III) nanoparticles embedded within the organic matter, which do not bind REE or other trace metals in significant proportions (REE and trace elements being preferentially complexed to organic matter); and finally (iii) REE provide a reliable and powerful tool, suitable for identifying trace metal sources during wetland soil reduction...|$|R

The rate of metal release and the alteration of metal distribution in <b>soil</b> <b>phases</b> after <b>soil</b> washing with a sulfosuccinamate surfactant solution (Aerosol 22) were evaluated for four contaminated soils. Furthermore, a sequential extraction scheme was carried out using selective extractants (HAcO, NH 2 OH$HCl, H 2 O 2 + NH 4 AcO) to evaluate which metal species are extracted by A 22 and the alteration in metal distribution upon surfactant-washing. Efficiency of A 22 to remove metals varied among soils. The washing treatment released up to 50 % of Cd, 40 % of Cu, 20 % of Pb and 12 % of Zn, mainly from the soluble and reduction soil fractions, therefore, greatly reducing the fraction of metals readily available in soil. Metal speciation analysis for the solutions collected upon soil washing with Aerosol 22 further confirmed these results. Copper and lead in solution were mostly present as soluble complexes, while Cd and Zn 2 were present as free ions. Besides, redistribution of metals in soil was observed upon washing. The ratios of Zn strongly retained in the soil matrix and Cd complexed with organic ligands increased. Lead was mobilized to more weakly retained forms, which indicates a high bioavailability of the remaining Pb in soil after washing.

Bulk soil, pore wall material and roots from individual biopores were collected from three depth layers in 45 - 75 cm soil depth. C and N contents in the pore walls were up to 3 times higher than in the bulk soil. A large variation of C and N contents between the walls of individual biopores indicated that the quality of the pore wall is a function of pore colonization by earthworms over time.

In addition, a number of experimental equations are employed to represent the hydraulic conductivity and the drainage characteristics of the soil, such as the suction-saturation relationship and the dependency of the hydraulic conductivity on suction. The global system of equations is then solved by using an implicit time-stepping algorithm based on the Generalised-α integration scheme. The accuracy of the numerical model and the finite element code is verified by comparing the numerical results with results obtained by an analytical solution...|$|R
