Contributing to the composition of 18 samples, the 5019 (1904 males and 3115 females) university students were from three cultural groups: Hong Kong, mainland China, and the United States. Each of the six variables was assessed by a self-report inventory. Results indicated that in all three cultures, students who rated themselves <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> the ability scales tended to <b>score</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> the individual-difference variable scales that denote positive values, such as higher cognitive-developmental levels and creativity-generating thinking styles.

40|$|We {{examine the}} link between {{unemployment}} and subjective well-being by introducing historically sensitive variables related to neoliberal ideology and policies such as measures of self-blame, shame, work ethic and flexibility. Drawing on a survey study we find that young job seekers (N = 357) have a significantly lower self-reported subjective well-being than employed persons {{of the same age}} (N = 183). Young and older unemployed people (N = 52) report the same level of subjective well-being; however, older unemployed people <b>score</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> clinical measures of depression, anxiety and stress.

We identify a minority of people who do not perceive themselves as unemployed even though they formally are, and drawing on governmentality studies we infer them to be entrepreneurs. We highlight the need to recognize heterogeneity and historical sensitivity when addressing the complex relationship between subjective well-being and unemployment. The implications of this empirical study are that different groups might benefit from different interventions and that policy makers should take this into consideration...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the present study was to examine if adolescents, who are going through a school transition, can achieve a higher peer status in a more {{socially}} accepted way. According to the Resource Control Theory (Hawley, 1999) there are five types of groups that use different strategies to achieve this higher peer status: prosocial controllers, coercive controllers, bi-strategic controllers, non-controllers and typical controllers. By doing a MANOVA and an ANOVA these five groups have been compared in this study on peer status (resource control, perceived popularity, being a leader in a group and peer likeability). The research shows that the bi-strategic controllers <b>score</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> resource control, perceived popularity and being a leader in a group, than the non-controllers and the typical controllers. The prosocial controllers <b>score</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> peer likeability than the bi-strategic controllers and the coercive controllers. This implies that adolescents, who are going through a school transition, can only achieve a higher peer status in a more socially accepted way for the peer status: peer likeability. For the other types of peer status, resource control, perceived popularity and being a leader in a group, the results show that it is not possible to achieve a higher peer status in a more socially accepted way...|$|R

The reasoning behind these improvements is connected to the holistic, integrated, hands-on, project based, cooperative and experiential learning activities that are all aspects of garden based education. In other words, student engagement in class is increased because they are being intrinsically motivated by [...] "real world" [...] experiences in a more informal setting than the classroom.

50|$|Mark Snyder {{originally}} developed a scale to measure whether people were {{high or low}} self monitors in 1974 as a 25-item measure. In his original study he found that Stanford University students <b>scored</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> the scale than did psychiatric inpatients, but significantly lower than people in the acting profession. The scale was revised into an 18-item measure that is considered psychometrically superior to the original scale and has been used extensively in self-monitoring studies. There has developed great debate {{over whether or not}} the self-monitoring scale is a unitary phenomenon. During the 1980s, factor analysis postulated that the self-monitoring scale was actually measuring several distinct dimensions. The three-factor solution was the most common and usually interpreted as Acting, Extraversion, and Other-Directedness (see willingness to communicate). There has developed consensus about the multifactorial nature of the items on the self-monitoring scale; however, there remain differing interpretations about whether or not that jeopardizes the validity of the self-monitoring concept.|$|E

Instructed fakers who were performing a concurrent task scored significantly lower on yield 1 scores. Genuines (non-fakers) did not exhibit this pattern in response to cognitive load differences.

Increasing cognitive load may facilitate the detection of deception because it is more difficult to act deceptively under these conditions.|$|E

50|$|Malnutrition {{has been}} shown to affect {{organizational}} processes of the brain such as neurogenesis, synaptic pruning, cell migration and cellular differentiation. This thus results in abnormalities in the formation of neural circuits and the development of neurotransmitter systems. However, some of these effects of malnutrition {{have been shown to be}} improved upon with a good diet and environment. Early nutrition can also affect brain structures that are actually correlated to IQ levels. Specifically, the caudate nucleus is particularly affected by early environmental factors and its volume correlates with IQ. In an experiment by Isaacs et al., infants born prematurely were either assigned a standard or high-nutrient diet during the weeks directly after birth. When the individuals were assessed later in adolescence, it was found that the high-nutrient group had significantly larger caudate volumes and <b>scored</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> verbal IQ tests. This study also found that the extent to which the caudate volume size related selectively to verbal IQ was much greater in male participants, and not very significant in females. This may help explain the finding in other earlier research that the effects of early diet on intelligence are more predominant in males.|$|E
50|$|Supporters of {{the truly}} {{collaborative}} approach {{feel that there is}} no need for that authority to be a content expert. However, studies conducted at several medical schools across Canada, the USA and Europe dispute this idea. For example, in an analysis of student performance following small group experiences with experts and non expert tutors, students at the University of Michigan Medical School rated their experiences with content experts significantly higher than those led by non-experts. They felt that even though an expert tutor may ask the same questions as a non-expert tutor, that the expert was more inclined to ask the questions at the most opportune time and was better able to reframe the question in a way that was more valuable to the students. Ultimately, the students who were assigned to the groups led by content experts <b>scored</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> their final exam. In another study, conducted at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada, it was determined that expert tutors use their knowledge to ask more effective questions and are better equipped to keep the groups from floundering.

5000|$|Rusalov (1993) in his {{analysis}} of sex differences in temperament [...] found that females <b>scored</b> <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> <b>on</b> temperament scales measuring verbal-social endurance and tempo and males scores higher on physical endurance and tempo scales. Rusalov suggested that the verbal superiority of females is in line with Geodakyan’s view about the function of the female partition of a species as designed to synchronize the norms and values of the community. Trofimova [...] reviewed the most consistent psychological and behavioural sex differences and linked them to the Geodakyan's (ETS). She suggested a pattern of consistent sex differences in physical, verbal and social dis/abilities is in line with the ETS’ idea about functional differentiation of a species into conservational, and variational partitions. In females, superiority in verbal abilities, rule obedience, socialisation, empathy and agreeableness was presented as a reflection of the systemic conservation function of the female sex. Male superiority in risk- and sensation seeking, physical abilities, higher rates in physical aggression, psychopathy, dyslexia, autism, schizophrenia, higher birth and accidental death rates was a reflection of the systemic variational function (testing the boundaries of beneficial characteristics) of the male sex. As a result, psychological sex differences might be influenced by a global tendency within a species to expand its norm of reaction, {{but at the same time}} to preserve the beneficial properties of the species.|$|E
