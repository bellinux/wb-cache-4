40|$|CHDS State/LocalPreparedness for {{response}} to a catastrophic event in the United States, natural disaster or terrorist attack, is a priority mission for the National Guard. Interagency coordination and collaboration {{is key to the}} success of this preparedness. Because of the state and regional responses being independent of Federal deployment, the National Guard requires interagency relationships specific to their operations. This thesis conducted an evaluation of the interagency coordination processes amongst the Department of Defense, National Guard Bureau, and Department of Homeland Security agencies. The thesis explores what additional procedural, policy, and structural mechanisms can be implemented to enhance interagency cooperation and collaboration between the National Guard Bureau and other homeland security agencies for domestic operations. Four recommendations are provided: establish an operationally focused Joint Interagency Coordinating Group at National Guard Bureau; organize National Guard homeland <b>security</b> oriented <b>liaison</b> <b>officers</b> under a Homeland <b>Security</b> <b>Liaison</b> Element; focus National Guard interagency coordination within the FEMA regional construct; and examine U. S. Northern Command for opportunities to fully integrate civilian agencies and National Guard into a civil-military command model.

50|$|A <b>liaison</b> <b>officer</b> is {{a person}} who liaises between two {{organizations}} to communicate and coordinate their activities. Generally, <b>liaison</b> <b>officers</b> are used to achieve the best utilization of resources or employment of services of one organization by another. <b>Liaison</b> <b>officers</b> often provide technical or subject matter expertise of their parent organization. Usually an organization embeds a <b>liaison</b> <b>officer</b> into another organization to provide face-to-face coordination.|$|R

40|$|Collaborations between {{organizations}} in the public sector, e. g., fire brigades, polices, military units, is often done via <b>liaison</b> <b>officers.</b> A <b>liaison</b> <b>officer</b> liaises between two organizations by providing a {{single point of contact}} and ensuring the efficient communication and coordination of their activities. Usually an organization embeds a <b>liaison</b> <b>officer</b> in another organization to provide face-to-face coordination. <b>Liaison</b> <b>officers</b> demand special requirements to the security mechanism of the IT infrastructure of the organization that act as host for a <b>liaison</b> <b>officer.</b> This holds, in particular, for Disaster Management Information Systems (DMIS). Such systems need, on the one hand, to support various ways of communication in a flexible and ad hoc manner. On the other hand, these systems need to protect, by law, the leakage of sensitive data. In this paper, we present a novel mechanism, based on role-based access control (RBAC), for supporting the flexible and secure information exchange between organizations using <b>liaison</b> <b>officers.</b> Our mechanism enables <b>liaison</b> <b>officers</b> to decide on their own authority which information they wants share with their home organizations while allowing the host organization to limit the access of <b>liaisons</b> <b>officers</b> to their system in a fine-grained manner...|$|R

In the past decades, a number of TREVI and EU Council policy instruments have aimed to enhance the common use of <b>liaison</b> <b>officers</b> by the Member States. This research article discusses these policy instruments {{from the perspective of}} the practicalities of the work of <b>liaison</b> <b>officers,</b> examines the underlying rationalities of the instruments and assesses their effects. The findings show that national interests of Member States remain paramount in posting <b>liaison</b> <b>officers.</b> Practices of <b>liaison</b> <b>officers</b> are largely governed by national regulations and organisational particulars, but also depend on the high level of discretion that <b>liaison</b> <b>officers</b> can exercise. In contrast, the policy instruments are largely driven by a political rationality and little intended effect of these instruments can be detected...|$|R
