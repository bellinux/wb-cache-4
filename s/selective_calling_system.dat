40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe thesis presents {{a mathematical model}} of a maritime VHF-FM Digital Selective Calling (DSC) System using grade of service as a criterion {{to determine if a}} single DSC channel can accommodate both distress and commercial calling. The model calculates the probability of a call being delayed, the average delay of a call, the probability of a call being answered within a certain time frame, and the throughput for the random access calling systems of ALOHA, Slotted ALOHA, Slotted ALOHA with Capture, Nonpersistent Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA), and 1 -Persistant CSMA. Analysis of the results indicates that all VHF DSC calling can be made on a single channel. Without regard to a cost-benefit evaluation, it was also determined that 1 -Persistent Carrier Sense Multiple Access was the superior random access calling system to utilize for the VHF-FM Digital <b>Selective</b> <b>Calling</b> <b>system.</b> [URL] United States Coast Guar...|$|E
50|$|Some <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> <b>systems</b> {{experience}} falsing. In other words, the decoder activates when a {{valid signal}} is not present. Falsing {{may come from}} a maintenance problem or poor engineering.|$|R
50|$|The {{system is}} {{backward}} compatible with digital <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> <b>systems,</b> allowing shore-based GMDSS systems to inexpensively establish AIS operating channels and identify and track AIS-equipped vessels, and {{is intended to}} fully replace existing DSC-based transceiver systems.|$|R
50|$|<b>Selective</b> <b>calling</b> {{is akin to}} the use of a lock on a door. A {{radio with}} carrier squelch is {{unlocked}} and will let any signal in. <b>Selective</b> <b>calling</b> locks out all signals except ones with the correct 'key', in this case a specific digital code. <b>Selective</b> <b>calling</b> <b>systems</b> can overlap; a radio may have (group call) and DTMF individual calling.|$|R
50|$|In {{conventional}} systems, {{units are}} separated into groups by <b>selective</b> <b>calling.</b> Radios are usually segmented into customers with each customer {{on a separate}} <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> code. <b>Systems</b> may use continuous tone-coded squelch system for this purpose. A disadvantage is that conventional systems require the user to disable <b>selective</b> <b>calling,</b> (to monitor,) {{in order to see}} if another company is talking before using the channel. Conventional systems are usually analog FM.|$|R
5000|$|This unusual {{usage of}} FEC {{redundancy}} {{is the primary}} innovation that differentiates ALE from previous <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> <b>systems</b> which either decoded a call or failed to decode due to noise or interference. A binary outcome of [...] "Good enough" [...] or not gave no way of automatically choosing between two channels, {{both of which are}} currently good enough for minimum communications. The redundancy-based scoring inherent in ALE thus allows for selecting the [...] "best" [...] available channel and (in more advanced ALE nodes) using all decoded traffic over some time window to sort channels into a list of decreasing probability-to-contact, significantly reducing co-channel interference to other users as well as dramatically decreasing the time needed to successfully link with the target node.|$|R
5000|$|Selcall (Selective Calling) transmits a {{burst of}} up to five inband audio tones at the {{beginning}} of each transmission. This feature (sometimes called [...] "tone burst") is common in European systems. Early systems used one tone (commonly called [...] "Tone Burst"). Several tones were used, the most common being 1,750 Hz, which is still used in European amateur radio repeater systems. The addressing scheme provided by one tone was not enough, so a two tone system was devised - one tone followed by a second tone (sometimes called a [...] "1+1" [...] system). Later on, Motorola marketed a <b>system</b> <b>called</b> [...] "Quik-Call" [...] that used two simultaneous tones followed by two more simultaneous tones (sometimes called a [...] "2+2" [...] system) that was heavily used by fire department dispatch systems in the USA. Later <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> <b>systems</b> used paging system technology that made use of five sequential tones. In the same way that a single CTCSS tone would be used on an entire group of radios, a single five-tone sequence is used in a group of radios.|$|R
50|$|A similar {{proprietary}} Motorola format used a seven-tone {{sequence and}} was called MODAT. Radios with this option were marketed in the US during the 1970s and 1980s. MODAT encoders in Motorola radios can be configured to send five-tone sequences with code plans compatible to CCIR, ZVEI, or the proprietary Motorola seven-tone-sequential format. These systems send tone sequences {{to identify a}} unit (unit ID) rather than for <b>selective</b> <b>calling.</b> Some <b>systems</b> used CTCSS and MODAT. In a unit ID application, every radio has a different five- or seven-tone code. Each time the push-to-talk is pressed, the tone sequence is transmitted. This code is displayed at the dispatch console to identify which unit has called. In some cases the code is translated to a vehicle number or other identifier.|$|R
50|$|Computer-aided {{dispatch}} (CAD), {{also called}} computer-assisted dispatch, {{is a method}} of dispatching taxicabs, couriers, field service technicians, mass transit vehicles or emergency services assisted by computer. It can either be used to send messages to the dispatchee via a mobile data terminal (MDT) and/or used to store and retrieve data (i.e. radio logs, field interviews, client information, schedules, etc.). A dispatcher may announce the call details to field units over a two-way radio. Some systems communicate using a two-way radio <b>system's</b> <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> features. CAD <b>systems</b> may send text messages with call-for-service details to alphanumeric pagers or wireless telephony text services like SMS. The central idea is that persons in a dispatch center are able to easily view and understand the status of all units being dispatched. CAD provides displays and tools so that the dispatcher {{has an opportunity to}} handle calls-for-service as efficiently as possible.|$|R
50|$|Amateur radio {{operators}} commonly provide local, regional, national, {{and international}} emergency / disaster relief communications. The need for interoperability on HF {{led to the}} adoption of Automatic Link Establishment ALE open networks by hams. Amateur radio adapted 2G ALE techniques, by utilizing the common denominators of the 2G ALE protocol, with a limited subset of features found in the majority of all ALE radios and controllers. Each amateur radio ALE station uses the operator's call sign as the address, also known as the ALE Address, in the ALE radio controller. The lowest common denominator technique enables any manufacturer's ALE radios or software to be utilized for HF interoperability communications and networking. Known as Ham-Friendly ALE, the amateur radio ALE standard is used to establish radio communications, through a combination of active ALE on internationally recognized automatic data frequencies, and passive ALE scanning on voice channels. In this technique, active ALE frequencies include pseudorandom periodic polite station identification, while passive ALE frequencies are silently scanned for <b>selective</b> <b>calling.</b> ALE <b>systems</b> include Listen Before Transmit as a standard function, and in most cases this feature provides better busy channel detection of voice and data signals than the human ear. Ham-Friendly ALE technique is also known as 2.5G ALE, because it maintains 2G ALE compatibility while employing some of the adaptive channel management features of 3G ALE, but without the accurate GPS time synchronization of 3G ALE.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Selcal (<b>selective</b> <b>calling)</b> controller, as {{intermediate}} equipment between selcal and radio station, {{is designed to}} achieve the software automation and remote control in aviation. The whole system adopts msp- 430 microcontroller as hardware core and C language as the method of software realization. This paper focuses on hardware connection and design to introduce the electrical design and software flow of selcal controller.. OBJECTIVE AND SIGNIFICANCE Selcal, also know as ground-air <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> device, {{has been used by}} land station for <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> of aircraft. Each aircraft has a unique <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> code, when the <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> device calls an aircraft, the <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> code, which consists of two connected audio pulse, shall be entered firstly. Two single tones that transmitted simultaneously are contained in each pulse. Selcal code will be transmitted by the shortwave radio station when the CALL push-button is pressed. When this code is received by the appropriate aircraft, the communication between radio station and aircraft is established. Therefore voice transmission connection between the ground and the aircraft can be achieved by using a handle. Fig. 1 Conventional model of <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> syste...|$|R
50|$|Tone squelch, {{or other}} forms of <b>selective</b> <b>calling,</b> is {{sometimes}} used to solve interference problems. Where more than one user is on the same channel (co-channel users), <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> addresses a subset of all receivers. Instead of turning on the receive audio for any signal, the audio turns on only {{in the presence of the}} correct <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> code. This is akin to the use of a lock on a door. A carrier squelch is unlocked and will let any signal in. <b>Selective</b> <b>calling</b> locks out all signals except ones with the correct key to the lock (the correct code).|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of addressed digital communications, some real-world analog communications systems performed a function very similar to the fictional CRM-114. Some aircraft radios used SELCAL (<b>selective</b> <b>calling),</b> which muted the receiver unless an assigned tone was received. Ground mobile radios used a similar <b>system</b> <b>called</b> CTCSS (Continuous Tone-Coded Squelch System).|$|R
5000|$|A general option {{setting for}} all MDC systems is to enable or disable an {{acknowledgement}} (ack) data packet. For example, following a <b>selective</b> <b>call,</b> the called radio replies with an ack. This data [...] "handshake" [...] confirms the called radio is powered on, has received and decoded the call. The encoder beeps {{to confirm the}} call got through to the target. In computer-aided dispatch, the encoder/decoder may pass the ack to the dispatch computer <b>system,</b> flagging the <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> as having been received by the mobile radio or automatically marking the time of call. The disadvantage of using an ack on busy channels is that more air time is used: roughly double the air time used by the <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> data alone. The ack packet takes roughly {{the same amount of}} air time as the <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> itself.|$|R

50|$|In a conventional, analog {{two-way radio}} system, a {{standard}} radio has noise squelch or carrier squelch which allows a radio to receive all transmissions. <b>Selective</b> <b>calling</b> {{is used to}} address a subset of all two-way radios on a single radio frequency channel. Where more than one user is on the same channel, (co-channel users,) <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> can address a subset of all receivers or can direct a call to a single radio. <b>Selective</b> <b>calling</b> features fit into two major categories: individual calling and group calling. Individual calls generally have longer time-constants: it takes more air-time to call an individual radio unit than to call {{a large group of}} radios.|$|R
50|$|In the U.S., MMSIs are {{primarily}} used for digital <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> and for assigning Inmarsat identities.|$|R
50|$|Four {{different}} {{techniques are}} commonly used. <b>Selective</b> <b>calling</b> {{can be regarded}} as a form of in-band signaling.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Basic {{base station}} {{elements}} {{used in a}} remote-controlled installation. <b>Selective</b> <b>calling</b> options such as CTCSS are optional.|$|R
50|$|In non-critical uses, <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> {{can also}} be used to hide the {{presence}} of interfering signals such as receiver-produced intermodulation. Receivers with poor specifications—such as inexpensive police scanners or low-cost mobile radios—cannot reject the strong signals present in urban environments. The interference will still be present. It will still degrade system performance but by using <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> the user will not have to hear the noises produced by receiving the interference.|$|R
5000|$|In the US, Federal Communications Commission rules require {{users of}} <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> {{to monitor the}} channel (i.e. switch to carrier squelch) before transmitting. In other words, the user must monitor (listen) {{to make sure the}} channel is not in use by someone on another <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> code before transmitting. To enforce this rule, base {{stations}} often have a monitor switch on the microphone. The push-to-talk button is split into two segments. One segment turns the <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> off. The other segment of the button transmits. A mechanical interlock prevents the transmit button from being pressed until the monitor button is down. This is called, [...] "compulsory monitor before transmit." [...] In mobile radios, microphones are stored in a hang-up box. When the microphone is pulled out of the hang-up, the radio reverts to carrier squelch, (the <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> feature is disabled). The user automatically monitors—verifies no one else is using the channel—by pulling the mike out of the hang-up box. Hand-held radios sometimes have LED indicators that show when the channel is in use.|$|R
50|$|Automatic number {{identification}} {{is also used}} to describe the functions of two-way radio <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> that identify the transmitting user.|$|R
50|$|ALE {{evolved from}} older HF radio <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> technology. It {{combined}} existing channel-scanning <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> concepts with microprocessors (enabling FEC decoding and quality scoring decisions), burst transmissions (minimizing co-channel interference), and transponding (allowing unattended operation and incoming-call signalling). Early ALE systems {{were developed in}} the late 1970s and early 1980s by several radio manufacturers. The first ALE-family controller units were external rack mounted controllers connected to control military radios, and were rarely interoperable across vendors.|$|R
50|$|In uses where missed <b>calls</b> are allowable, <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> {{can also}} hide the {{presence}} of interfering signals such as receiver-produced intermodulation. Receivers with poor specifications—such as scanners or low-cost mobile radios—cannot reject the unwanted signals on nearby channels in urban environments. The interference will still be present and will still degrade system performance but by using <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> the user {{will not have to}} hear the noises produced by receiving the interference.|$|R
50|$|In {{designing}} a system, {{it is important}} to pick <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> tones that do not conflict with remote control tones in use.|$|R

5000|$|Control {{examples}} - For example, function A may be <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> mode, while function B is the vibrate function. Function C monitors channel 2. D is {{the mode}} {{that is similar}} to a scanner. When the pager is turned on, eight short beeps are heard along with flashing of both LEDs. Holding down the reset button in <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> mode will monitor the channel for any transmission on that channel at that time, or pure static as the squelch is bypassed.|$|R

5000|$|Minitor pagers, {{depending}} on the model and application, can operate in the VHF Low Band, VHF High Band, and UHF frequency ranges. They are alerted by using two-tone sequential <b>Selective</b> <b>calling,</b> generally following the Motorola Quick Call II standard. In other words, the pager will activate when a particular series of audible tones are sent over the frequency (commonly {{referred to as a}} [...] "page") the pager is set to. For example, if a Minitor is programmed on VHF frequency channel 155.295 MHz and set to alert for 879 Hz & 358.6 Hz, it will disregard any other tone sequences transmitted on that frequency, only alerting when the proper sequence has been received. The pager may be reset back into its <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> mode by pressing the reset button, or it can be programmed to reset back into <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> mode automatically after a predetermined amount of time, to conserve battery power.|$|R
50|$|Digital <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> or DSC is a {{standard}} for sending pre-defined digital messages via the medium-frequency (MF), high-frequency (HF) and very-high-frequency (VHF) maritime radio systems. It is a core part of the Global Maritime Distress Safety System (GMDSS).|$|R
50|$|A GMDSS {{system may}} include {{high-frequency}} (HF) radiotelephone and radiotelex (narrow-band direct printing) equipment, with calls initiated by digital <b>selective</b> <b>calling</b> (DSC).

50|$|Motorola {{uses the}} term mode to refer to {{channels}} on some conventional two-way radio models. In this use, a mode consists of a radio frequency channel and all channel-dependent options such as <b>selective</b> <b>calling,</b> channel scanning, power level, and more.|$|R
50|$|The Motorola Minitor is a portable, analog, receive only, voice pager {{typically}} {{carried by}} fire, rescue, and EMS personnel (both volunteer and career) to alert of emergencies. The Minitor, slightly {{smaller than a}} pack of cigarettes, is carried on a person and usually left in <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> mode. When the unit is activated, the pager sounds a tone alert, followed by an announcement from a dispatcher alerting the user of a situation. After activation, the pager remains in monitor mode much like a scanner, and monitors transmissions on that channel until the unit is reset back into <b>selective</b> <b>call</b> mode either manually, or automatically after a set period of time, depending on programming.|$|R
