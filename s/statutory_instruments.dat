25|$|By the Second World War and the Labour {{government}} of Clement Attlee, trade union membership was well established and collective agreements covered over 80 per {{cent of the}} workforce. With the British Empire in rapid dissolution, immigration from Commonwealth countries, and record levels of female workplace participation the character of Britain's workforce was changing fast. Though the common law was sometimes comparatively progressive, sometimes not, the first statutes to prohibit discrimination focused on gender and race emerged in the 1960s as the Civil Rights Act was passed in the United States. Discrimination in employment (as in consumer or public service access) was formally prohibited on grounds of race in 1965, gender in 1975, disability in 1995, sexual orientation and religion in 2003 and age in 2006. A complicated and inconsistent jamboree of Acts and <b>statutory</b> <b>instruments</b> was placed into a comprehensive code in the Equality Act 2010. Much discrimination law is now applicable throughout the European Union, to which the UK acceded in 1972. Although labour laws in the early European Treaties and case law were scant, the Social Chapter of the Maastricht Treaty brought employment rights squarely into the EU's jurisprudence. Meanwhile, starting from the Contracts of Employment Act 1963, workers gained {{a growing list of}} minimum statutory rights, such as the right to reasonable notice before a fair dismissal and a redundancy payment. Labour governments through the 1960s and 1970s were troubled by reform of the unwieldy trade union system. Despite producing reports such as In Place of Strife and the Report of the committee of inquiry on industrial democracy which would have made unions accountable to their members and created more direct workplace participation, reform did not take place.|$|E

Each of these is {{separately}} numbered, with the numbering resuming from [...] "No. 1" [...] {{at the start of}} each calendar year; thus the Radioactive Substances Exemption (Scotland) Order 2011 is cited as [...] "SSI 2011 No. 147".|$|R
500|$|The A82 {{was one of}} {{the first}} trunk roads, which were created in 1936, and has {{historically}} been described in official government documentation as part of the [...] "London – Carlisle – Glasgow – Inverness Trunk Road" [...] in which the A6 and A74 made up the rest of the route. On 1 April 1996, however, the section from Glasgow to the Dalnottar Interchange with the A898 was detrunked. The main length of the A82, as managed by Transport Scotland, is now described in <b>statutory</b> <b>instruments</b> and orders as the [...] "Dalnottar – Inverness Trunk Road". From Glasgow to Dalnottar, the route is now the responsibility of the Glasgow City Council and the West Dunbartonshire Council in their respective areas.|$|E
500|$|Pressure {{to reverse}} the {{restrictions}} grew after the <b>statutory</b> <b>instruments</b> of Section 31 of the Irish government's Broadcasting Authority Act 1960 lapsed in January 1994. These had prohibited radio and television interviews with representatives of paramilitary groups and Sinn Féin. From that point, anyone in Northern Ireland {{with access to the}} Republic of Ireland's state broadcaster, RTÉ, could hear the voices of anyone still banned from the airwaves by the UK regulations. Responding to the Dublin government's decision, Gerry Adams said, [...] "Over 20 years of political censorship has served to stunt any hopes of a resolution of the conflict. It has denied the right of information. Good riddance." [...] The regulations particularly came under the spotlight during a visit Adams made to the United States in 1994, where he gave a speech that was widely broadcast around the world, but had to be dubbed in the UK because of the ban. In May 1994 the National Union of Journalists launched a legal challenge with the European Commission of Human Rights, seeking to take the British government to court for breach of freedom of expression under the European Convention of Human Rights, but the case was rejected. A similar challenge brought against the Irish government in 1991 over its broadcast ban had also been thrown out.|$|E

The exact extent to which, and the areas in which, the Union government uses Hindi and English, respectively, {{is determined by the}} provisions of the Constitution, the Official Languages Act, 1963, the Official Languages Rules, 1976, and <b>statutory</b> <b>instruments</b> made by the Department of Official Language under these laws.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1990s, {{a series}} of <b>statutory</b> <b>instruments</b> {{relating}} to weighing devices and to the sale of pre-packaged goods were passed to ensure that United Kingdom law on metrology was harmonised with that of its EEC partners. [...] In line with EEC practice, the meaning of weights displayed on pre-packaged goods was changed in 1980 to show the average weight of each item in the batch rather than the guaranteed minimum weight of each individual item.

[...] These twelve vessels (including one German submarine), all lost on military service, provide a small {{representative sample of}} all such vessels. [...] All other vessels that meet the criteria of the act are subject to a rolling programme of assessment and those that meet the criteria will be designated as protected places. [...] The order that is currently in force, since March 2017, designates 79 wrecks as protected places. This means that diving is allowed but divers must follow the rule of look, don't touch.|$|E
