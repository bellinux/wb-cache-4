40|$|This thesis shows {{a concept}} of a {{coupling}} point for gripper fingers. These gripping fingers {{are part of a}} three-finger-gripper for a new research robot at the DLR (German Areospace Center). Changing the gripper fingers gives high flexibility with regard to the feasible gripping tasks and a simple structure of the three-finger-gripper with only four degrees of freedom. The concept includes a PCB with spring loaded contacts for electical connection and a conical dovetail joint for mechnical connection. The mounting direction of the coupling point is in the acutation direction of the linear drive for the gripper finger. The transmission of the mechanical degree of freedom is achieved with two racks and pinions and the <b>overload</b> <b>release</b> is bases on the friction effect. The realisation of the concept is critical due to the geometrical boundaries which leads to gripping forces below the requirements. Some possible solutions are contemplated and unconsidered areas for alternative solutions are shown...|$|R
40|$|In neurons, excitotoxic {{stimulation}} induces mitochondrial calcium <b>overload</b> and the <b>release</b> of pro-apoptotic proteins, which triggers delayed cell death. The precise {{mechanisms of}} apoptogen release, however, remain controversial. To characterize {{the linkage between}} mitochondrial calcium load and cell vulnerability, and {{to test the hypothesis}} that only a subpopulation of mitochondria damaged by calcium <b>overload</b> <b>releases</b> apoptogens, we have measured directly the concentrations of total Ca (free plus bound) in individual mitochondria and monitored in parallel structural changes and the subcellular localization of pro-apoptotic cytochrome c after NMDA overstimulation in cultured hippocampal neurons. Beyond transient elevation of cytosolic calcium and perturbation of Na � /K � homeostasis, NMDA stimulation induced dramatic, but mainly reversible, changes in mitochondria, including strong calcium elevation, membrane potential depolarization, and variable swelling. Elevation of matrix Ca in the approximately one-third of mitochondria that were strongly swollen, as well as the absence of swelling when Ca 2 � entry was abolished, indicate an essential role for Ca overload. Shortly after NMDA exposure, cytochrome c, normally localized to mitochondria, became diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm, coincident with the appearance of severely swollen mitochondria with ruptured outer membranes; under these conditions, cytochrome c was retained in intact mitochondria, implying that it was released mainly from damaged mitochondria. Consistent with the role of mitochondrial Ca overload, carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone decreased Ca accumulation, prevented cytochrome c release, and was neuroprotective. These results support a mechanism in which delayed excitotoxic death involves apoptogen release from a subpopulatio...|$|R

50|$|Until {{the knot}} is {{tightened}} and properly dressed, the highwayman's hitch has little holding power.The highwayman's hitch {{is susceptible to}} capsizing when the hitched object is substantially larger than the rope diameter. The failure occurs because the second bight sees {{the force of the}} standing part, but is held in place by the working part, which has no tension. When capsizing, tension on the standing part pulls the second bight through the first bight. This drags the slip-tuck through, and will <b>release</b> the <b>hitch</b> if the third bight isn't long enough. Alternatives to the highwayman's hitch have been devised to mitigate collapse when tied around large objects.|$|R
40|$|Many {{engineered}} barriers {{are expected to}} function {{for hundreds of years}} or longer. Over the course of time, it is likely that some barriers will experience infiltration to the point of breakthrough. This study compares the recovery from breakthrough of two storage- evapotranspiration type {{engineered barriers}}. Replicates of test plots comprising thick soil and capillary/biobarrier covers were wetted to breakthrough in 1997. Test plots were kept cleared of vegetation to maximize hydrologic stress during recovery. Following cessation of drainage resulting from the wetting irrigations, water storage levels in all plots were at elevated levels compared to pre-irrigation levels. As a result, infiltration of melting snow during the subsequent <b>spring</b> <b>overloaded</b> the storage capacity and produced drainage in all plots. Relatively rapid melting of accumulated snowfall produced the most significant infiltration events each year during the study. Capillary barriers yielded less total drainage than thick soil barriers. By limiting drainage, capillary barriers increased water storage in the upper portions of the test plots, which led to increased evaporation from the capillary barrier plots compared to thick soil plots. Increased evaporation in the capillary barrier plots allowed more water to infiltrate in the second season following the wetting tests without triggering drainage. All thick soil plots again yielded drainage in the second season. Within two years of intentionally induced breakthrough, evaporation alone (without transpiration) restored the capability of the capillary barrier covers to function as intended, although water storage in these covers remained at elevated levels...|$|R

40|$|Aims TGF-ß regulates tissue fibrosis: TGF-ß {{promotes}} fibrosis, whereas {{bone morphogenetic protein}} (BMP) - 7 is antifibrotic. To {{demonstrate that}} (i) left ventricular (LV) remodelling after pressure overload is associated with disequilibrium in the signalling mediated by these cytokines, and (ii) BMP- 7 exerts beneficial effects on LV remodelling and reverse remodelling. Methods and results We studied patients with aortic stenosis (AS) and mice subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) and TAC release (de-TAC). LV morphology and function were assessed by echocardiography. LV biopsies were analysed by qPCR, immunoblotting, and histology. Pressure overload reduced BMP- 7 and pSmad 1 / 5 / 8 and increased TGF-ß and pSmad 2 / 3 in AS patients and TAC mice. BMP- 7 correlated inversely with collagen, fibronectin, and ß-MHC expressions, and with hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction, and directly with the systolic function. Multiple linear regression disclosed BMP- 7 and TGF-ß as hypertrophy predictors, negative and positive, respectively. BMP- 7 prevented TGF-ß-elicited hypertrophic program in cardiomyocytes, and Col 1 A 1 promoter activity in NIH- 3 T 3 fibroblasts. The treatment of TAC mice with rBMP- 7 attenuated the development of structural damage and dysfunction, and halted ongoing remodelling. The reverse remodelling after pressure <b>overload</b> <b>release</b> was facilitated by rBMP- 7, and hampered by disrupting BMP- 7 function using a neutralizing antibody or genetic deletion. Conclusion The disequilibrium between BMP- 7 and TGF-ß signals plays a relevant role in the LV remodelling response to haemodynamic stress in TAC mice and AS patients. Our observations may provide new important insights aimed at developing novel therapies designed to prevent, halt, or reverse LV pathological remodelling in pressure overload cardiomyopathy...|$|R

40|$|Background-—Myocardial microRNA- 133 a (miR- 133 a) is {{directly}} related to reverse remodeling after pressure <b>overload</b> <b>release</b> in aortic stenosis patients. Herein, we assessed the significance of plasma miR- 133 a as an accessible biomarker with prognostic value in predicting the reversibility potential of LV hypertrophy after aortic valve replacement (AVR) in these patients. Methods and Results-—The expressions of miR- 133 a and its targets were measured in LV biopsies from 74 aortic stenosis patients. Circulating miR- 133 a was measured in peripheral and coronary sinus blood. LV mass reduction was determined echocardiographically. Myocardial and plasma levels of miR- 133 a correlated directly (r= 0. 46, P< 0. 001) supporting the myocardium as a relevant source of plasma miR- 133 a. Accordingly, a significant gradient of miR- 133 a was found between coronary and systemic venous blood. The preoperative plasma level of miR- 133 a was higher in the patients who normalized LV mass 1 year after AVR than in those exhibiting residual hypertrophy. Logistic regression analysis identified plasma miR- 133 a as a positive predictor of the hypertrophy reversibility after surgery. The discrimination of the model yielded an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0. 89 (P< 0. 001). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed plasma miR- 133 a and its myocardial target Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome candidate 2 /Negative elongation factor A as opposite predictors of the LV mass loss (g) after AVR. Conclusions-—Preoperative plasma levels of miR- 133 a reflect their myocardial expression and predict the regression potential of LV hypertrophy after AVR. The value of this bedside information for the surgical timing, particularly in asymptomatic aortic stenosis patients, deserves confirmation in further clinical studies.
