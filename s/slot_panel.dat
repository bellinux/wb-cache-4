2500|$|Jet blast {{deflectors}} {{began to}} appear at airports in the 1950s. Airports in the 1960s used jet blast deflectors with a height of , but airports in the 1990s needed deflectors that were twice as high, and even up to [...] high for jet airliners such as the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and MD-11, which have engines mounted in the tail above the fuselage. Airports often place their deflectors at the beginnings of runways, especially when roadways or structures are adjacent. Airports that are in dense urban areas often have deflectors between taxiways and airport borders. Jet blast deflectors usually direct exhaust gases upward. However, a low-pressure zone can form behind the blast fence, causing ambient air and debris to be drawn upward with the jet exhaust, and hot, toxic gases to circulate behind the blast fence. Jet blast deflectors {{have been designed to}} counteract this problem by using multiple panels and various angles, and by using <b>slotted</b> <b>panel</b> surfaces.|$|R
40|$|We present deep-subwavelength {{diffusing}} surfaces {{based on}} acoustic metamaterials, namely metadiffusers. These sound diffusers are rigidly backed <b>slotted</b> <b>panels,</b> with each slit being loaded by {{an array of}} Helmholtz resonators. Strong dispersion is produced in the slits and slow sound conditions are induced. Thus, the effective thickness of the panel is lengthened introducing its quarter wavelength resonance in the deep-subwavelength regime. By tuning the geometry of the metamaterial, the reflection coefficient of the panel can be tailored to obtain either a custom reflection phase, moderate or even perfect absorption. Using these concepts, we present ultra-thin diffusers where the geometry of the metadiffuser has been tuned to obtain surfaces with spatially dependent reflection coefficients having uniform magnitude Fourier transforms. Various designs are presented where, quadratic residue, primitive root and ternary sequence diffusers are mimicked by metadiffusers whose thickness are 1 / 46 to 1 / 20 times the design wavelength, i. e., between about a twentieth and {{a tenth of the}} thickness of traditional designs. Finally, a broadband metadiffuser panel of 3 [*]cm thick was designed using optimization methods for frequencies ranging from 250 [*]Hz to 2 [*]kHz...|$|R
40|$|The {{trends of}} room and {{building}} environment designs valuing acoustical solutions for space and energy saving, {{as well as}} health and environmental friendly sound absorbers are increasing. Transparent/translucent absorbers, such as perforated glass, plastic panel, foil, and honeycomb-structures are merely some suitable choices for these demands. The absorption performance of the micro-perforated (slotted) transparent/translucent material/structure is limited, due to their special characteristics. The vibration of the foil will for example counteract the friction of the air drop with the internal surface of the hole and deteriorates the low frequency absorption performance of the structure. Astutely designed thicker and rigid perforated (<b>slotted)</b> <b>panels</b> will have lower or middle frequency absorptions, but reflects more sound waves at higher frequencies, causing the degrade of absorption coefficient in the high frequency ranges. The affects to the absorption of the parameters of micro perforation (slot) on the "rigid" panel (foil) absorber, like thickness, hole radius, hole distance, air gap depth, has been extensively considered. In this paper the discussion will {{be focused on the}} effects of other phenomenon like the vibration of the panels, the existence {{and the size of the}} grids in the air gap behind the front panel and multi-layered structures.

40|$|The {{absorption}} {{performance of}} a locally-reacting acoustic metamaterial under oblique incidence is studied. The metamaterial is composed of a <b>slotted</b> <b>panel,</b> each slit being loaded by an array of Helmholtz resonators. The system is analytically studied using the transfer matrix method, accounting for the viscothermal losses both in the resonator elements and in the slits, allowing {{the representation of the}} reflection coefficient in the complex frequency plane. We show that by tuning the geometry of the metamaterial, perfect absorption peaks can be obtained on demand at selected frequencies and different angles of incidence. When tilting the incidence angle, the peaks of perfect absorption are shifted in frequency, producing an acoustic iridescence effect similar to the optic iridescence achieved by incomplete band gap. Effectively, we show that in this kind of locally-reacting metamaterial, perfect and omnidirectional absorption for a given frequency is impossible to achieve because the metamaterial impedance does not depend on the incidence angle (i. e., the impedance is a locally reacting one). The system is interpreted in the complex frequency plane by analysing the trajectories of the zeros of the reflection coefficient. We show that the trajectories of the zeros do not overlap under oblique incidence, preventing the observation of perfect and omnidirectional absorption in locally reacting metamaterials. Moreover, we show that for any locally resonant material, the absorption in diffuse field takes a maximal value of 0. 951, which is achieved by a material showing perfect absorption for an incidence angle of 50. 34 degrees...|$|R

As with any numerical method, the complexity of the problem that can be practically dealt with is determined by the availability of computational resources.

Directly employing a very fine mesh to map the fine feature for the whole system will inevitably result in immense computational requirements which usually far exceed the capabilities of commonly available computer systems.

40|$|Kraven på att nybyggda bostäder ska vara energisnåla i driftskedet ökar hela tiden av flera anledningar. Dels vill brukarna hålla driftskostnaderna så låga som möjligt och dels är det miljöaspekten som spelar in. Men hur energisnål kan en villa egentligen göras och hur påverkas arkitekturen då den görs extremt energieffektiv? I den här rapporten utreds tio energieffektiva principer som kan användas för att göra en villa mer energisnål och energiproducerande. Alla tio principer har tillämpats i en villa som projekterats under arbetets gång. De tio principerna är: Husets utformning Konstruktion Isolerade skjutluckor Solceller Solavskärmning Energitak Uppvärmningssystem Vindkraftverk Vindskydd Medvetenhet och inredning Resultaten visar att villan kommer ge ett energiöverskott på cirka 6   000 kWh/år enligt enklare handberäkningar av husets energiförbrukning och den producerade energin. Arkitekturen blir tydligt påverkad av de energieffektiva principerna men huset är ändå fullt funktionellt. Att tillämpa tio energieffektiva principer i en villa kan vara svårt att försvara ekonomiskt då pay-off tiderna är långa på grund av höga investeringskostnader. Arbetet har utförts på KTH campus Haninge i samarbete med Sweco Architects AB. The {{demands on}} newly {{constructed}} buildings to be energy efficient in the operational stage are increasing {{all the time}} by many reasons. Partly because {{the people living in}} the house want to keep the operational costs as low as possible and partly because of the impact on the environment. But how energy efficient can a villa be made and how does it affect the architecture when it is made extremely energy efficient? In this essay ten energy efficient principles are investigated which {{can be used to make}} a villa more energy efficient and energy producing. All ten principles have been applied in one villa that has been designed during this project. The ten principles are: The design and shape of the house Construction Insulated sliding <b>slots</b> Solar <b>panels</b> Sun shading Energy roof Heating system Wind power turbine Wind protection Consciousness and interior design The results show that the villa will produce an overbalance of energy of about 6   000 kWh/year according to simpler calculations of the house´s energy consumption and the energy that it produces.

This type of carpentry has a frame with horizontal beams or logs tenoned into slots or mortises in the posts. Pièce sur pièce en coulisse: Literally piece on piece in a groove is a widespread type of carpentry which blurs the lines between log, plankwall and framing techniques, thus is classified {{as any of the}} above."The support of horizontal timbers by corner posts is an old form of construction in Europe. It was apparently carried across much of the continent from Silesia by the Lausitz urnfield culture in the late Bronze Age." [...] Examples also persist in southern Sweden, in the Alps, Hungry, Poland, Denmark, and Canada. Usually the origin of corner post {{construction is}} credited to the immigrants of the far-Eastern French in Canada and Alpine-Alemannic Germans or Swiss in the U. S. This technique is best known in German as standerbohlenbau or bohlenstanderbau. Horizontal wood pieces (poles, beams, planks) tenoned into grooves in posts. This type of construction allows shorter timbers to be used and a building can be extended an indefinite length by adding more bays, typically measuring ten feet. Similar methods of construction are found in most if not all Viking settled regions and was common in Scandinavia. It is one of the earliest building types of French-Canada used extensively by the Hudson’s Bay Company for trading posts across Canada. It became a common, widespread building method in Canada. Other French names reflect the shape of wood (bois) used between the posts such as planche en coulisse, madriers-, or pieux-. Also recorded in French as bois en coulisse, poteaux en coulisse, madriers en coulisse, poteaux entourées de pieux, charpente entourée de madriers, poteaux entourées de madriers, en poteaux et close de pieux, en pieux sur pieux. (Lessard and Vilandré 1974:117) and “piece-sur-piece de charpente“ (French Canadian). Piece sur piece literally means piece on piece and also describes log building with notched corners or any kind of stacked construction. [...] Used in the United States predominantly in early French forts and settlements along the Mississippi River, though examples also occur in other states including Maine, New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Ohio, Wyoming, Maryland and Michigan where the it is the construction method of oldest house in the state (Navarre-Anderson Trading Post, 1789). A particularly interesting example is the Golden Plough Tavern (c. 1741), York, York County, PA, which has the ground level of corner-post construction, the second floor of fachwerk (half timbered) and was built for a German with other Germanic features “This sophisticated system, which uses carefully constructed mortise-and-tenon joints, was common from the 1820s to the 1860s and represents some 5 percent of the log houses built in western Maryland.” Occasionally these buildings have earthfast posts. James Hébert incorrectly presented it as “an entirely Canadian style”. Also known other parts of central Europe, Medieval British Isles, including (Switzerland, Austria and S. Germany),. The Norman French were credited with the introduction of this building technique to Canada, though this technique is found in northwest Europe, the Alps to Hungry.
