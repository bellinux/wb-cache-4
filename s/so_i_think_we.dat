500|$|In May 2012, Malcolm Young {{confirmed}} that the band were working on a potential follow-up to 2008's Black Ice. But he warned that fans were in for a longer wait than expected, after lead singer Brian Johnson suggested there would be new material the next year. Malcolm stated, [...] "You know what Brian's like. He just says things and then walks away. It'll be a little while– {{a year or two}} anyway. I've been doing some jamming on some song ideas but I do that all the time, as do the rest of the band. We are still working. But we had a long rest between Stiff Upper Lip and Black Ice, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> need a couple of years to recuperate and work on it a bit more." ...|$|E
500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] segment {{published}} by HBO {{shortly after the}} airing of the episode, Benioff spoke {{about the relationship between}} Sansa Stark and Jon Snow {{at this point in the}} season, saying [...] "Over the course of this season they've come to really rely upon each other, but she doesn't really trust him completely. She didn't tell him about the meeting with Littlefinger, she didn't tell him that she summoned the Knights of the Vale, there's definitely a little hint of conflict there. So I think there's a little bit of anger about that and a little bit of jealousy, and that relationship will be crucial to watch." [...] Benioff continued by referencing the declaration of Jon Snow as King of the North, noting [...] "We see the second 'King in the North!' scene with Jon and I think it was important to us that it evoked in that first 'King in the North!' scene. Very different circumstances, different environment. In some ways, the evocation of the first one is meant to be a little worrisome because it was a very triumphant moment when Robb is named King in the North but it didn't go so well for the previous King in the North. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> have to be a little worried for Jon and at the same time it's a pretty big reversal and, you know, for a character who was dead at the beginning of the season to be declared king at the end of it. He's done well. He's done well in ten short episodes." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{think that}} we've {{always wanted to}} be doctors and psychiatrists. I was really sick when I was a kid so I grew up in a lot of hospitals. Sadie was in a couple of institutions... <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> all had our eyes wide open. So I guess we've always wanted to see it from the other side."

6000|$|Martin's great form loomed in the doorway. [...] "The Vrouw Jansen has fled away," [...] he said, [...] "and {{the street}} is quite quiet now, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> had better be moving before any see us, my masters." ...|$|R
2500|$|It was {{performed}} by Coldplay's Chris Martin and Jonny Buckland {{on either side of}} Ariana Grande at the One Love Manchester concert on 4 June 2017. Martin introduced the song by saying [...] "Ariana, you've been singing a lot for us, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> in Britain want to sing for you. This is called Don't Look Back in Anger, and this is from us to you".|$|E
2500|$|Sturgeon {{met with}} new UK Prime Minister Theresa May in Edinburgh on 15 July 2016 after the latter {{had made it}} clear that UK unity was a high priority. Afterwards, Sturgeon said that [...] "It would be inconceivable for any prime {{minister}} to seek to {{stand in the way of}} a referendum if that is what the Scottish Parliament voted for ... if there's a clear sense that that's what people in Scotland want, would be completely the wrong thing to do." [...] She added a conciliatory note, however in her assessment of May: [...] "She's a woman who has a fairly businesslike way of doing things, which I have too. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> can find a way of working together, notwithstanding those disagreements." ...|$|E
2500|$|The South African team {{received}} US$100,000 and {{a trophy}} {{for being the}} champions. Sheikh Hasina, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, handed over the trophy and the cash award. Cronje said: [...] "it feels good to win this tough tournament. There were no second chances in this knock-out format, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> did well to play three good matches. We knew we were among the top there, but this has renewed our confidence for next year's World Cup." [...] The West Indian team received US$60,000 for being the runners-up. Lara said: [...] "not many expected us to reach the final but we showed we were good enough for that. I am happy the boys fought till the end, {{it was a very}} close game. It's all about taking your chances and the South Africans took theirs well and deserved to win." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are well}} drilled, I can see that," [...] said the admiral, on dismissing them. [...] "They {{tell me you}} think of {{entering}} our navy. If you wish to do <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> likely <b>we</b> can find suitable openings for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, gentlemen, if you please," [...] said George, [...] "we {{will walk}} through these here turnips. I put two coveys of birds in here myself, and it's rare good 'lay' for them; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> had better {{see if they}} will let us come nigh them." ...|$|R
6000|$|Gertrude's pen, however, again went to work. The shares {{were put}} down at £5,000. 'If {{they can only}} be sold for <b>so</b> much, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> may manage it,' said Mrs. Woodward; 'I am sure that Harry can get the remainder--indeed {{he said he could}} have more than that.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Whatever happened," [...] {{he remarked}} sagely, [...] "we should {{scarcely}} be welcome {{in their country}} afterwards, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> had better do nothing unless we are obliged." ...|$|E

60|$|Quest. But is {{not this}} the way to make Christ to loath us? You know when {{children}} fall down in the dirt, they do usually before they go home make their clothes as clean as they can, for fear their parents should chide them; and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> should <b>we.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> when <b>we</b> {{talked about}} the [...] "fifth filter" [...] we should have brought in all this stuff -- the way {{artificial}} fears are created with a dual purpose... partly {{to get rid of}} people you don't like but partly to frighten the rest.Because if people are frightened, they will accept authority.

6000|$|... "A mere form," [...] {{repeated}} Ramiro, [...] "of course. But {{the world}} attaches so much importance to forms, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> will have this one witnessed--No, not by myself, who am an interested party--by someone independent," [...] and calling Hague Simon and the waiting-woman he bade them set their names {{at the foot}} of the documents.|$|R
6000|$|... 'On {{one side}} {{into their own}} court, on the other into Wulstan Street--a quiet place on the whole--all walls and warehouses; and there's an {{excellent}} parish church, Mr. Underwood's; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> might do worse.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{think we}} had better not," [...] said Lady Montfort to Myra. [...] "After all, {{there is nothing like}} 'my crust of bread and liberty,' and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> had better stay at the Bristol." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> all escaped--that is, except Thompson, if {{his name}} WAS Thompson; {{it might have}} been Parker," [...] {{continued}} Uncle Sylvester, gazing with a certain languid astonishment on the eager faces around him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lady Bellamy, {{your stories}} are either true or untrue. If true, I should take no notice of them, because {{they must have}} {{happened}} before he loved me; if untrue, they would be a mere waste of breath, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> may dispense with the stories--they would influence me {{no more than the}} hum of next summer's gnats." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “This is awkward,” Nelson said. “I wish {{one of the}} {{batteries}} would fire a few guns; that might give us some indication as to our position, though I am by no means sure that in this thick atmosphere the sound would reach <b>so</b> far. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> were about eleven miles away when the fog caught us.” ...|$|R
30|$|Sammy: I was {{thinking}} that they [students] would {{have to pick up}} a load and put that on (their vehicle). How does the mass change it as a challenge activity?

6000|$|... "That is what I meant; we {{are quite}} alone here. I {{have not heard}} a horse-hoof or a {{footstep}} or the hoot of a train for miles. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> might stop here {{and ask for a}} miracle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{whatever}} may be its name, I {{know that}} it is in the centre of the island somewhere, and the centre of any land always means the mountains; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> had better decide to go to the left, and--" ...|$|E
60|$|ATTEN. Well, Sir, as {{you have}} intimated, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> have, in this place, spoken enough about these kind of men; if you please, let us return again to Mr. Badman himself, {{if you have any}} more to say of him.|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{think in}} order to really heal the world we need the 'wisdom of darkness.' This can be the Third World, dark people, women, or our 'shadows,' ... {{all the things we}} do not want to confront within ourselves, so we project them onto others and call them terrorists. <b>So,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> need 'endarkenment' for a while, not enlightenment, to heal the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think the}} latter {{will be the}} best plan.

6000|$|... “Yes, {{that may}} be <b>so,</b> but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> are pretty safe to lick them at either of these places if they will come out and fight us fair, whereas in the West Indies they are a good bit stronger. There are so many ports and islands that, as we are, so to speak, a good deal scattered, they might at any moment come upon us in double our strength.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Baas," [...] he answered, [...] "the Great Medicine is {{here with}} us upon the earth and your reverend father, the Predikant, is with us in the sky, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> had better stop here and do what we can, {{especially}} as I {{do not want to see}} those reeds any more at present." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be silly," [...] Conyers replied. [...] "Our {{dear old}} lady friend Thomson isn't here to worry <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> {{can make you}} free of the ship.

6000|$|... "That {{would be}} a poor supply for a week for two of us," [...] Vincent muttered, as he removed the {{contents}} of the basket and stored them carefully in the locker; [...] "however, if it's going to be a gale there is sure to be some rain with it, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> shall manage very well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We must hope <b>so,</b> Tom. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> {{have both}} done, I won't say our best, but {{as well as}} could be {{expected}} in so rough a life.
