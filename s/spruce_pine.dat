5|$|Inocybe maculata is an ectomycorrhizal species, {{with a wide}} {{ecological}} range. It can {{be found}} in all biomes from low-lying deciduous woodland to arctic-alpine areas. It typically grows on the ground in deciduous (or mixed) woodland, favouring beech. It grows best on chalky soil, among leaf litter. In North America, it favours sandy soil, clay or moss. It is also encountered on pathsides. As well as beech, the species has been recorded growing in association with hornbeam, hazel, oak and lime. Inocybe maculata f. fulva favours birch, <b>spruce,</b> <b>pine,</b> Populus, willow, (as well as Dryas and Polygonum in alpine regions). Mushrooms grow individually or in scattered groups. Though widespread in the areas it is found, it is not a common species. It can be found from western Europe to eastern Asia; and in North America, from where it was first collected in the 1960s. Inocybe maculata f. fulva was first identified in France, and has since been found elsewhere in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Penn sent three commissioners to {{supervise}} the settlement and to set aside 10,000 acres (40km²) for the city. The commissioners bought land from Swedes at the settlement of Wicaco, and from there began {{to lay out the}} city toward the north. The area went about a mile along the Delaware River between modern South and Vine Streets. Penn's ship anchored off the coast of New Castle, Delaware, on October 27, 1682, and he arrived in Philadelphia a few days after that. He expanded the city west to the bank of the Schuylkill River, for a total of 1,200 acres (4.8km²). Streets were laid out in a gridiron system. Except for the two widest streets, High (now Market) and Broad, the streets were named after prominent landowners who owned adjacent lots. The streets were renamed in 1684; the ones running east-west were named after local trees (Vine, Sassafras, Mulberry, Cherry, Chestnut, Walnut, Locust, <b>Spruce,</b> <b>Pine,</b> Lombard, and Cedar) and the north-south streets were numbered. Within the area, four squares (now named Rittenhouse, Logan, Washington and Franklin) were set aside as parks open for everyone. Penn designed a central square at the intersection of Broad and what is now Market Street to be surrounded by public buildings.|$|E

25|$|Owing to {{the parks}} and {{environment-friendly}} policies, the Pavlovsk area has relatively low level of pollution. In 1978–1983 the Pavlovsk Park contained more than 360,000 trees of 54 species: 16 species of <b>spruce,</b> <b>pine,</b> larch and fir, two species of birch, two species of willow, two of basswood, oaks, elm, alder, aspen, European rowan, bird cherry, 88 shrub species, of which the dominant were yellow acacia, meadowsweet and dogwoods. In 1978, there were 71 species of birds belonging to 28 families and 9 orders. Mammals include squirrels, hares, weasels, stoats, moles, shrews, hedgehogs, red voles and muskrats. In winter, the parks are sometimes visited by fox, wild boar and moose. Amphibians and reptiles are mostly frogs, toads and lizards. There are 87 species of insects belonging to 46 families.|$|E
5000|$|The {{arboretum}} {{includes a}} pre-settlement Bur Oak grove (5 ha / 12 acres) whose largest trees {{are estimated to}} be over 300 years old.

30|$|The {{standard}} errors of height prediction applying only fixed effects {{are the highest}} in <b>pine</b> followed by <b>spruce</b> and birch (Table 3). In comparison the reduction in standard error using the full mixed models are about 1  m for pine, 0.7  m for spruce and 0.6  m for birch. The {{standard errors}} of the mixed models are rather similar for <b>spruce</b> and <b>pine</b> and the lowest for birch. The explained deviance using only fixed effects is considerably higher for <b>spruce</b> compared to <b>pine</b> and birch whereas {{the values of the}} mixed models are similar for <b>spruce</b> and <b>pine</b> and the lowest for birch.|$|R
5000|$|The taiga is the world's largest biome {{apart from}} the oceans. In North America it covers most of inland Canada and Alaska as well as parts of the extreme {{northern}} continental United States (northern Minnesota through the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to Upstate New York and northern New England), where it {{is known as the}} Northwoods or [...] "North woods". In Eurasia, it covers most of Sweden, Finland, much of Norway, some of the Scottish Highlands, some lowland/coastal areas of Iceland, much of Russia from Karelia in the west to the Pacific Ocean (including much of Siberia), and areas of northern Kazakhstan, northern Mongolia, and northern Japan (on the island of Hokkaidō). However, the main tree species, the length of the growing season and summer temperatures vary. For example, the taiga of North America mostly consists of spruces; Scandinavian and Finnish taiga consists of a mix of <b>spruce,</b> <b>pines</b> and birch; Russian taiga has <b>spruces,</b> <b>pines</b> and larches depending on the region, while the Eastern Siberian taiga is a vast larch forest.|$|R

500|$|In 1974, Littleton {{also began}} experimenting with vitreography (printmaking using glass plates). [...] He {{received}} a research {{grant from the}} University in 1975 to continue this work, and his first prints from this process were shown in a show at the Madison Art Center. [...] When he left Wisconsin in 1977 and established his own studio in <b>Spruce</b> <b>Pine,</b> North Carolina, he designated one room in the studio for printmaking. [...] By 1981, he had hired a part-time printmaker, and in 1983 he built a separate facility for the presses. [...] He regularly invited artists in various media to explore the possibilities. [...] Littleton’s own prints were often simple geometric shapes, and sometimes made from shotgun-shattered safety glass. [...] When back problems forced him to [...] stop working in hot glass in 1990, Littleton continued his printmaking.|$|E
500|$|Lactarius alnicola, {{commonly}} known as the golden milkcap, is a species of fungus in the Russulaceae family. The fruit bodies produced by the fungus are characterized by a sticky, vanilla-colored cap up to [...] wide with a mixture of yellow tones arranged in faint concentric bands. The stem is up to [...] long and has yellow-brown spots. When it is cut or injured, the mushroom oozes a white latex, which has an intensely peppery taste. The acrid taste of the fruit bodies renders them unpalatable. The fungus is found in the western United States and Mexico, where it grows in mycorrhizal associations with various coniferous trees species, such as <b>spruce,</b> <b>pine</b> and fir, and deciduous species such as oak and alder. It has also been collected in India. Two varieties have been named: var. pitkinensis, known from Colorado, and var. pungens, from Michigan.|$|E

2500|$|Because pines have no insect or decay {{resistant}} qualities after logging, {{they are}} generally recommended for construction purposes as indoor use only (ex. indoor drywall framing). This wood left outside {{can be expected to}} last no more than 12–18 months depending on the local climate. [...] It is commonly referred to by several different names which include North American timber, SPF (<b>spruce,</b> <b>pine,</b> fir) and whitewood.|$|E
2500|$|The Indian {{market is}} {{accustomed}} to teak and other hardwoods that {{are perceived to be}} more resistant to termites, decay and are able to withstand the tropical climate. [...] Teak wood is typically seen as a benchmark with respect to grade and prices of other wood species. [...] Major imported wood species are tropical woods such as mahogany, garjan, marianti, and sapeli. [...] Plantation timber includes teak, eucalyptus, and poplar, as well as <b>spruce,</b> <b>pine,</b> and fir. [...] India imports small quantities of temperate hardwoods such as ash, maple, cherry, oak, walnut, beech, etc. as squared logs or as lumber. India is the world's third largest hardwood log importer.|$|E
