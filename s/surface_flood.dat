40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{technical}} options for warning of <b>surface</b> water <b>flooding</b> in England andWales and {{presents the results}} of an Environment Agency funded project. Following the extensive <b>surface</b> water <b>flooding</b> experienced in summer 2007 a rainfall threshold-based Extreme Rainfall Alert (ERA) was piloted by the Met Office and Environment Agency providing initial steps towards the establishment of a warning for some types of <b>surface</b> water <b>flooding.</b> The findings of this paper are based primarily on feedback on technical options from a range of professionals involved in flood forecasting and warning and flood risk management, about the current alerts and about the potential options for developing a more targeted <b>surface</b> water <b>flood</b> warning service. Providing <b>surface</b> water <b>flooding</b> warnings presents a set of technical, forecasting and warning challenges related to the rapid onset of flooding, the localised nature of the flooding, and the linking of rainfall and flood forecasts to flood likelihood and impact on the ground. Some examples of rainfall alerting and <b>surface</b> water <b>flood</b> warning services from other countries are evaluated, as well as a small number of recently implemented local services in England and Wales. Various potential options for implementation of a service are then explored and assessed. The paper concludes that development of a <b>surface</b> water <b>flood</b> warning service for England and Wales is feasible and is likely to be useful to emergency responders and operational agencies, although developing such a service for the pluvial components of this type of flooding is likely to be feasible sooner than for other components of <b>surface</b> water <b>flooding</b> such as that caused by sewers. A targeted <b>surface</b> water <b>flood</b> warning service could be developed for professional emergency responders in the first instance rather than for the public for whom such a service without further operational testing and piloting would be premature...|$|R
40|$|<b>Surface</b> water <b>flooding</b> occurs {{regularly}} across England and Wales, {{especially during}} the summer months. It is widely acknowledged that <b>surface</b> water <b>flooding</b> presents a particular challenge to forecasters because of the difficulties inherent in forecasting intense localised rainfall and the highly complex runoff and drainage processes which operate at the surface, particularly in urban areas. The Flood Forecasting Centre (FFC) {{has a responsibility to}} provide guidance on the risk of <b>surface</b> water <b>flooding</b> to Category 1 and 2 responders across England and Wales. Consequently, there is the requirement for improved methods for forecasting <b>surface</b> water <b>flood</b> risk and the FFC is currently involved in developing and trialling a novel <b>surface</b> water <b>flood</b> forecasting system, the <b>Surface</b> Water <b>Flooding</b> Hazard Impact Model (SWF HIM). The SWF HIM offers significant advances over existing <b>surface</b> water <b>flood</b> forecasting methods used by the FFC, including provision of a risk-based approach. The SWF HIM links probabilistic runoff forecasts from the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology’s Grid-to-Grid model with a library of pre-calculated surface water impact information compiled by the Health and Safety Laboratory. These probabilistic runoff forecasts are combined with impact information to provide a forecast of <b>surface</b> water <b>flood</b> risk at a 1 km 2 resolution across England and Wales.

40|$|Giant dike swarms {{are present}} on Venus, Earth, and Mars [1]. On Mars, sets of graben {{radiating}} from centres in the Tharsis volcanic region are taken as {{evidence for the}} presence of giant dike swarms [2]. The Mangala Fossa graben system and the related Mangala Valles flood valley probably have had their origins in crustal fracturing caused by the intrusion of one of these dikes [3, 4], which we call the Arsia-Mangala dike. The graben segments formed when the combination of regional extensional tectonic forces and local stresses due to dike injection caused surface subsidence along pairs of inward-facing faults [5]. In the longest graben segment, subsurface aquifer water exploited the graben faults to reach the <b>surface,</b> <b>flood</b> the graben interior, and overflow to erode the Mangala Valles flood channels [4]. Here we propose that 3 other groups of surface features are related to the emplacement of the Arsia-Mangala dike.

40|$|During a {{flood event}} over a karst watershed, the {{connections}} between surface and ground waters appear to be complex ones. The karst may attenuate surface floods by absorbing water or contribute to the <b>surface</b> <b>flood</b> by direct contribution of karst waters in the rivers (perennial and overflowing springs) and by diffuse resurgence along the hillslopes. If {{it is possible to}} monitor each known outlet of a karst system, the diffuse contribution is yet difficult to assess. Furthermore, all these connections vary over time according to several factors such as the water content of the soil and underground, the rainfall characteristics, the runoff pathways. Therefore, the contribution of each compartment is generally difficult to assess, and flood dynamics are not fully understood. To face these misunderstandings and difficulties, we analysed surface waters during six recent flood events in the Lirou watershed (a karst tributary of the Lez, in South of France). Because of the specific chemical signature of karst waters, chemical analyses can supply information about water pathways and flood dynamics. Then, we used the dilution law to combine chemical results, flow data and field observations to assess the dynamics of the karst component of the flood.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} the cooling of intrusive and extrusive igneous bodies on the temperature history and surface heat flow of the Parana Basin. The Serra Geral igneous event (130 – 135 Ma) covered most of this basin with flood basalts. Associated with this event numerous sills and dykes intruded the sediments and basement, and extensive underplating may have occurred in the lower crust and upper mantle beneath the basin. We develop an analytical model of the conductive cooling of tabular intrusive bodies and use it to calculate temperatures within the sediments as a function of time since emplacement. Depending on the thickness of these igneous bodies and the timing of sequential emplacement, the thermal history of a given locus in the basin can range from a simple extended period of higher temperatures to multiple episodes of peak temperatures separated by cooling intervals. The cooling of <b>surface</b> <b>flood</b> basalts, sills and dykes is capable of maintaining temperatures abovc the normal geothermal gradient temperatures for a few hundred thousand years, while large-scale underplating may influence temperatures for up to 10 million years. We conclude that any residual heat from the cooling of the Serra Geral igneous rocks has long since decayed to insignificant values and that present-day temperatures and heat flow are not affected.

Lowest values of soil respiration at the permanent swamp were {{a result of the}} <b>surface</b> <b>flood,</b> while low soil moisture content led to low soil respiration values at the rain-fed grassland and also at the upper lying areas of the seasonal floodplain. Soil temperature alone was a poorly related to soil respiration, while a simple model combining soil water content and soil temperature provided strong correlations with soil respiration. Species dominating wetter habitats showed highest stomatal sensitivity to vapour pressure deficit. Grasses at the seasonal floodplain showed high water use efficiency and strong stomatal limitation of CO 2 assimilation as the dry season progressed. During the wet season, high CO 2 assimilation among the grasses at the permanent swamp was associated with high nitrogen use efficiency, while at the rain-fed grassland high CO 2 assimilation was associated with high leaf nitrogen and leaf phosphorus values. Within each species and across the sites leaf phosphorus appeared to exert stronger influence on leaf-level photosynthesis than leaf nitrogen.

Potential suitability and/or unsuitability of lands for new structures {{must be considered in}} areas affected by underground mining. It is well-known that subsidence, slope instability, and <b>surface</b> <b>flooding</b> are frequently observed in underground mining areas. Thus, a map that takes into account such geo-hazards and classifies suitable and unsuitable areas for new structures is needed. Areas affected by underground mining of coal in Stonava near to the border of the Czech Republic and Poland represent specific areas where subsidence, slope instability, and <b>surface</b> <b>flooding</b> problems need a strategy for future utilization of the landscape by means of land use plans. In light of the above reasons, the methodology and preparation of a map model incorporating the effect of landslides and <b>surface</b> <b>flooding</b> has been introduced in this study.

Chronological variations in the building site categories in the study area have been analyzed as another part of the study.

40|$|Flood events cause {{significant}} damage {{not only on}} the surface but also underground. Infiltration of surface water into soil, flooding through the urban sewer system and, in consequence, rising groundwater are the main causes of subsurface damage. The modelling of flooding events {{is an important part of}} flood risk assessment. The processes of subsurface discharge of infiltrated water necessitate coupled modelling tools of both, surface and subsurface water fluxes. Therefore, codes for surface flooding, for discharge in the sewerage system and for groundwater flow were coupled with each other. A coupling software was used to amalgamate the individual programs in terms of mapping between the different model geometries, time synchronization and data exchange. The coupling of the models was realized on two scales in the Saxon capital of Dresden (Germany). As a result of the coupled modelling it could be shown that surface flooding dominates processes of any flood event. Compared to flood simulations without coupled modelling no substantial changes of the surface inundation area could be determined. Regarding sewerage, the comparison between the influx of groundwater into sewerage and the loading due to infiltration by flood water showed infiltration of <b>surface</b> <b>flood</b> water to be the main reason for sewerage overloading. Concurrent rainfalls can intensify the problem. The infiltration of the sewerage system by rising groundwater contributes only marginally to the loading of the sewerage and the distribution of water by sewerage has only local impacts on groundwater rise. However, the localization of risk areas due to rising groundwater requires the consideration of all components of the subsurface water fluxes. The coupled modelling has shown that high groundwater levels are the result of a multi-causal process that occurs before and during the flood event...|$|E
40|$|Shallow {{groundwater}} is {{an important}} source of water for the maintenance and restoration of ecosystems in arid environments, which necessitates a deeper understanding of its complex spatial and temporal dynamics driven by hydrological processes. This study explores the dominant hydrological processes that control the shallow groundwater dynamics in the Gobi Desert-riparian-oasis system of the lower Heihe River, a typical arid inland river basin located in northwestern China. The groundwater level and temperature were monitored in 14 shallow wells at 30 -min intervals during the 2010 - 2012 period. After combining this information with meteorological and hydrological data, a comprehensive analysis was conducted to understand the dynamic behaviour of the shallow groundwater system and to determine the dominant factors that control the groundwater flow processes. The results of the study indicate notably large temporal and spatial variations in both the groundwater level and temperature. Noticeable fluctuations in the groundwater level (0. 5 - 1 m) and temperature (4 - 8 C) were observed in the riparian zone, evidencing a clear river influence. In comparison, the groundwater fluctuations in the Gobi Desert were more stable (the annual variations of the water table were less than 0. 5 m, and the water temperature varied by no more than 2 C). Strong variations in the groundwater table (1. 5 - 5. 0 m/year) and temperature (1. 5 - 6. 5 C), mainly caused by <b>surface</b> <b>flood</b> irrigation and groundwater pumping, were observed in the oasis area. The investigated sites were categorized into three types that reflect the dominant hydrological processes: (1) the riparian zone, dominated by riverbank filtration and groundwater evapotranspiration; (2) the Gobi Desert area, controlled by groundwater evaporation and lateral recharge; and (3) the oasis area, dominated by groundwater evapotranspiration as well as surface-groundwater interactions caused by human activities. 2012 John Wiley Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|For {{thousands}} of years, the thick Laurentide Ice Sheet covered {{a large part}} of northern North America, damming northward-draining rivers. As this ice retreated, large lakes formed along its margin. Glacial Lake Agassiz was the largest of these ice-marginal lakes, covering an area of > 800, 000 km 2 (more than twice the size of the largest lake in the modern world, the Caspian Sea) before it drained catastrophically into the Labrador Sea. Even before that, Lake Agassiz had periodically released large volumes of water into the ocean via the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence and the Athabasca-Mackenzie River systems. The last and largest of these outbursts released > 150, 000 km 3 through Hudson Bay and Hudson Strait in 6 - 12 months; the average flux over that period was ~ 5 Sv (1 Sv = 1 × 106 m 3 s- 1). When a volume of water this large is discharged into a coastal sea like the Labrador Sea, it may generate a <b>surface</b> <b>flood</b> wave or a tsunami if the water mass is large enough and introduced in a short time. To our knowledge no previous calculations have been made to estimate the potential impact of a flood burst on the generation of solitary waves. Using analogies of tsunamis generated by submarine landslides and ocean earthquakes, the amplitude of a Lake Agassiz generated tsunami is estimated to have been at least 2 m. Directionality considerations, as well as the effect of the Coriolis Force in the Northern Hemisphere, suggest that the resulting tsunami probably traveled 50 - 100 km along the west coast of the Labrador Sea, south of Hudson Strait where the outburst entered the ocean, before being dissipated. The erosional and depositional affects of historic and prehistoric tsunamis are present in the geological record, and provide guidance in seeking evidence for the Lake Agassiz flood burst and subsequent tsunami.

Ensemble rainfall prediction models are key to quantifying uncertainty in forecasting the rainfall that causes <b>surface</b> water <b>flooding.</b> • Detailed <b>surface</b> water <b>flood</b> inundation models exist and are widely used in design and research activities, but none {{were found to be}} ready for real-time use. The Grid-to-Grid (G 2 G) distributed hydrological model was chosen for used in the Glasgow Pilot as it can provide ensemble forecasts of <b>surface</b> water <b>flooding,</b> and takes account of the intensity and pattern of rainfall, land cover and slope, and antecedent conditions. • The research developed a novel methodology for impact assessment that links surface runoff to the severity of flooding impacts on people, property and transport. Use is made of a library of information based on SEPA’s Regional Pluvial (rainfall-related) Flood Hazard maps. • For the Glasgow Pilot, G 2 G was operated over a 10 km by 10 km area encompassing Glasgow’s East End and the main areas of activity for the 2014 Commonwealth Games. The research team developed an operational application, called FEWS Glasgow, to support running the model in real-time and reporting on the likely impacts of <b>surface</b> water <b>flooding.</b> A new Daily Glasgow Daily <b>Surface</b> Water <b>Flood</b> Forecast was designed and produced based on operational requirements and emergency responder feedback...|$|R

The crater is bordered in the northward direction by the Elysium Basin, and in eastward direction by Hesperian channels and the Aeolis Mensae 2. The crater displays a rim with two distinct erosion stages: (a) though eroded, the south rim of Gale has an apparent crest line visible from the north to the southwest (b) the west and northwest rims are characterized by a strong erosion that, in some places, partially destroyed the rampart, leaving remnant pits embayed in smooth-like deposits. The same type of deposits is observed north, outside Gale, it also borders the Aeolis Mensae, covers {{the bottom of the}} plateau scarp, and the crater floor. The central part of Gale shows a 6400 km 2 subround and asymmetrical deposit: (a) the south part is composed of smooth material, (b) the north part shows spectacular terraces, streamlines, and channels. The transition between the two parts of the deposit is characterized by a scarp ranging from 200 to 2000 in high. The highest point of the scarp {{is at the center of}} the crater, and probably corresponds to a central peak. Gale crater does not show a major channel directly inflowing. However, several large fluvi systems are bordering the crater, and could be at the origin of the flooding of the crater, or have contributed to. One fluvial system is entering the crater by the southwest rim but cannot be accounted alone for the volume of sediment deposited in the crater. This channel erodes the crater floor deposit, and ends in a irregular-shaped and dark albedo feature. Gale crater shows the morphology of a crater filled during sedimentation episodes, and then eroded Part of the lower sediment deposition contained in Gale might be ancient and not only aqueous in origin. According to the regional geologic history, the sedimentary deposit could be a mixture of aeolian and pyroclastic material, and aqueous sedimentary material that can originate both from drainage of the regional subsurface aquifer, and/or from <b>surface</b> <b>flood.</b> The central deposit shows three main levels: (a) the current crater floor (north of Gale), (b) an ancient level about 200 rn higher (south of Gale), and (c) the massive terraced deposits. A crater statistics on the 15, 400 kM 2 area of the crater floor and deposit [3, 41 gave: 259 +/- 112. 4 craters, most of them partly embayed in the sedimentary deposit, and all inferior to 5 -km diameter. For superimposed crater population only, the result is 194 +/- 112. The deduced relative ages ranges from Early to Middle Amazonian. The population of craters are comparable for the three levels, implying that the last sedimentation/erosion episode on Gale was recent and affected the whole crater. The streamlined morphology of the border of the deposit, the layering, the channels, and the terraces are compatible with a significant fluvio-lacustrine history of the site. Multiple levels may suggest different episodes, but the common statistical age of the three levels shows that the last episode involved the whole crater. The origin of the lake water in Gale may have varied in time. Three major contributions have been proposed: (a) the drainage of the regional underground aquifer by Gale crater over an area of 110 -km radius around the crater which would have provided approximately 1, 600 cubic km of water, (b), surface drainage entering Gale by the south and north rims. In the south, a 250 -km long system originates in the cratered uplands in a Noachian crater material plain (Nc), and crosses Hesperian and Amazonian crater material plains (AHc) northward [1]. Several fluvial systems originate in the Aeolis Mensae, east of Gale. They may had two functions in time: to recharge, the underground aquifer in the region of Gale, and to supply surface water in the crater by overspilling the northern rim, and (c) surface floods that originated from the rising of the water level in the Elysium Basin. According to the Amazonian age of Gale's floor, and the erosion direction in the crater, a flood from Elysium Basin is the most likely event to explain the material observed in Gale, and the formation of the last lake. This last flood may have been important enough to flood the central deposit up to about 1400 m above the crater floor, leaving two islands (non stream lined features) at the center of the deposit. Terrace spacing suggests a regular drop of the lake level in time. Fractures in terraces perpendicular to the shoreline can be interpreted either as: (a) the result of the drainage systems during the waning of the lake, or (b) traces of the pressure of an ice-covered sheet associated with subglacial drainage. The presence of a lake of such volume during the Amazonian period is one more evidence that water was still active on Mars relatively recently. Gale crater offers the rare opportunity to unveil a key-period of the martian history. The Amazonian might proved not as cold and dry as previously thought. The presence of large lakes and basins (Elysium Basin is large as the Mediterranean Sea), reinforces the model of an extensive water activity during the Amazonian that has still to be understood in the context of an assumed cooling and drying planet. The sediments and rocks that were left of this period in Gale keep the record of the climatic conditions of the Amazonian and the clues that are missing to understand the climatic evolution of Mars. In addition, Gale crater presents the advantage to be located at the plateau/plain boundary, which has never been studied and contains information about the two main martian geological units. As a conclusion, we propose a table that summarizes the worthiness of a mission in Gale crater, and the expected science return relative to the objectives to be met by the Surveyor Program.
