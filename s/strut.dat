The <b>strut</b> is present in most Eliurus, but absent in some specimens of E.grandidieri. The subsquamosal fenestrae (openings in the squamosal bone) are fairly large. The auditory bullae are small. The incisors are weak and the enamel on the upper incisors is yellow to light orange.

5|$|Shortly after stylists penned {{the first}} design sketches, Holden {{engineers}} {{began work on}} developing the chassis. Opel, which had {{provided the basis for}} all previous Commodore generations, ceased production of their rear-wheel drive Omega in 2003. This meant that Holden had two options: to use another GM platform, or to develop an all-new vehicle. GM's new premium rear-wheel drive Sigma platform was to see production in the 2002 Cadillac CTS. Holden's engineers were offered this platform, but decided it was not appropriate. The Sigma platform's double A-arm front suspension and extensive use of aluminium were too costly for the VE's market segment. The luggage compartment was deemed too small and the Sigma interior package could not be stretched sufficiently to become a family-sized car. In particular, the rear-seat shoulder width was too tight. These major drawbacks made Holden decide to develop an all-new platform, known as the GM Zeta platform, on which a number of forthcoming GM vehicles will also be based. The Zeta suspension system comprises new double-pivot MacPherson <b>strut</b> for the front and a four-link independent rear setup. These replace the previous simple MacPherson <b>strut</b> design front and much criticised semi-trailing arm rear suspension, for improved ride and handling.|$|E

In the afternoon, Pattle shot down another Ro.37bis from 72oGruppo near Permet, killing Capitano Fuchs and Sergente Vescia. On 4 December 1940, the RAF claimed nine Fiat CR.42s destroyed and two probables.

40|$|Background-Pathology {{studies on}} fatal cases of very late stent {{thrombosis}} have described incomplete neointimal coverage as common substrate, {{in some cases}} appearing at side-branch <b>struts.</b> Intravascular ultrasound studies have described the association between incomplete stent apposition (ISA) and stent thrombosis, but the mechanism explaining this association remains unclear. Whether the neointimal coverage of nonapposed side-branch and ISA <b>struts</b> is delayed with respect to well-apposed <b>struts</b> is unknown. Methods and Results-Optical coherence tomography studies from 178 stents implanted in 99 patients from 2 randomized trials were analyzed at 9 to 13 months of follow-up. The sample included 38 sirolimus-eluting, 33 biolimus-eluting, 57 everolimus-eluting, and 50 zotarolimus-eluting stents. Optical coherence tomography coverage of nonapposed side-branch and ISA <b>struts</b> was compared with well-apposed <b>struts</b> of the same stent by statistical pooled analysis with a random-effects model. A total of 34 120 <b>struts</b> were analyzed. The risk ratio of delayed coverage was 9. 00 (95 % confidence interval, 6. 58 to 12. 32) for nonapposed side-branch versus well-apposed <b>struts,</b> 9. 10 (95 % confidence interval, 7. 34 to 11. 28) for ISA versus well-apposed <b>struts,</b> and 1. 73 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 34 to 2. 23) for ISA versus nonapposed side-branch <b>struts.</b> Heterogeneity of the effect was observed in the comparison of ISA versus well-apposed <b>struts</b> (H= 1. 27; I 2 = 38. 40) {{but not in the}} other comparisons.

5|$|The Wrights {{wrote to}} several engine manufacturers, but none met {{their need for}} a {{sufficiently}} lightweight powerplant. They turned to their shop mechanic, Charlie Taylor, who built an engine in just six weeks in close consultation with the brothers. To keep the weight low enough, the engine block was cast from aluminum, a rare practice for the time. The Wright/Taylor engine had a primitive version of a carburetor, and had no fuel pump. Gasoline was gravity-fed from the fuel tank mounted on a wing <b>strut</b> into a chamber next to the cylinders where it was mixed with air: the fuel-air mixture was then vaporized by heat from the crankcase, forcing it into the cylinders.|$|E
5|$|The {{back margin}} of the {{zygomatic}} plate is located close {{to the front of}} the upper first molar. The incisive foramina do not extend between the molars. Unlike in both Holochilus and Lundomys, the palate is flat, lacking a distinct ridge at the midline. The parapterygoid fossae, which are located behind the palate at the level of the molars, are excavated somewhat above the level of the palate. A <b>strut</b> of the alisphenoid bone is present, separating two openings in the skull, the masticatory–buccinator foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium. The subsquamosal fenestra, an opening at the back of the skull determined by the shape of the squamosal, is present but small. The squamosal probably lacks a suspensory process that contacts the tegmen tympani, the roof of the tympanic cavity, a defining character of oryzomyines.|$|E
5|$|The incisive {{foramina}} (openings in {{the front}} part of the palate) are long, sometimes extending to between the first molars (M1). The bony palate is broad and short, with the posterior margin between the third molars (M3). Nephelomys levipes is the only other oryzomyine with such a short palate, although that of Eremoryzomys polius is only slightly longer. The posterolateral palatal pits (openings in the back part of the palate near the M3) vary from small to fairly large and are located in slight fossas (depressions). In Eremoryzomys, these fossas are deeper. The roof of the mesopterygoid fossa, the opening behind the palate, is completely closed or contains small sphenopalatine vacuities. The vacuities are much larger in Eremoryzomys. The alisphenoid <b>strut,</b> a piece of bone that separates two foramina (openings), is present in all Drymoreomys specimens examined, except in one juvenile specimen.|$|E

5|$|The {{timing of}} black vultures' {{breeding}} season {{varies with the}} latitude at which they live. In the United States, birds in Florida begin breeding as early as January, for example, while those in Ohio generally do not start before March. In South America, Argentinian and Chilean birds begin egg-laying as early as September, while those further north on the continent typically wait until October. Some in South America breed even later than that—black vultures in Trinidad typically do not start until November, for example, and those in Ecuador may wait until February. Pairs are formed following a courtship ritual which is performed on the ground: several males circle a female with their wings partially open as they <b>strut</b> and bob their heads. They sometimes perform courtship flights, diving or chasing each other over their chosen nest site.|$|E
5|$|Compared to E.nitidus and E.macconnelli, {{the skull}} is {{relatively}} small and slender.

The alisphenoid <b>strut,</b> an extension of the alisphenoid bone which separates two foramina (openings) in the skull (the masticatory-buccinator foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium) is rarely present; its presence is more frequent in E.nitidus.

5|$|Oryzomys {{species have}} a large skull with a short rostrum and high braincase.

The zygomatic plate is broad and has a well-developed zygomatic notch at its front. The zygomatic arch is robust and contains a small but distinct jugal bone. The interparietal bone, part of the roof of the braincase, is narrow and short; its narrowness is a synapomorphy for O.couesi plus the marsh rice rat according to Weksler's analysis. The incisive foramina are long, with their back margin {{at the front of the}} first molars or further back. The palate is also long, extending beyond the back margin of the maxillary bone, and is perforated near the third molars by well-developed posterolateral palatal pits.

In the mandible (lower jaw), the capsular process (a process at the root of the incisor) is weak to absent and the upper and lower masseteric ridges, which anchor some of the chewing muscles, do not join into a single crest and reach their front margin below the first molar.|$|E

The small mouth forms a transverse line; the edge of the lower jaw is scalloped, and when closed usually conceals the teeth. There are 14–16 tooth rows in each jaw.

The incisive foramina, openings in the front part of the palate, extend back to a point between the front roots of the M1s. The bony palate itself is broad and lacks many indentations and protuberances present in other species. Its posterior margin is at the level of the upper third molars (M3s). There is no alisphenoid <b>strut,</b> so that the masticatory-buccinator foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium, two openings on the underside of the skull, are fused.
