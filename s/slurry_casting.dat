40|$|A {{system is}} {{provided}} for casting thin sheets (or tapes) of particles bound together, {{that are used}} for oxygen membranes and other applications, which enables the particles to be cast at a high packing density in a tape of uniform thickness. A slurry contains the particles, a binder, and a solvent, and is cast against the inside walls of a rotating chamber. Prior to spraying the slurry against the chamber walls, a solvent is applied to a container. The solvent evaporates to saturate the chamber with solvent vapor. Only then is the <b>slurry</b> <b>cast.</b> As a result, the slurry remains fluid long enough to spread evenly over the casting surface formed by the chamber, and for the slurry particles to become densely packed.

The EPI coating with biomimetic structure was obtained by programmed heating the EPAA <b>slurry</b> <b>casting</b> onto the negative PDMS template. The anticorrosive performance of as-prepared biomimetic EPI coating was demonstrated by performing a series of electrochemical measurements (Tafel, Nyquist, and Bode plots) upon cold-rolled steel (CRS) electrode in a NaCl aqueous solution. It {{should be noted that the}} biomimetic EPI coating with rose petal-like structure was found to exhibit better anticorrosion than that of EPI without biomimetic structure. Moreover, the surface contact angle of water droplets for biomimetic EPI coating was found to be ~ 150 °, which is significantly higher than that of EPI coating with smooth structure (~ 87 °), indicating that the EPI coating with biomimetic structure reveals better hydrophobicity. The apparent mechanism for improved anticorrosive properties is twofold: (1) the biomimetic structure of EPI coating can repel water droplets. (2) electroactivity of EPI coating promotes the formation of densely passive layer of metal oxide on metallic surface...|$|E

40|$|Porous alumina {{containing}} hydrothermal derived hydroxyapatite (HA) composite {{were successfully}} fabricated via protein foaming-consolidation method. Alumina and HA powders were mixed with yolk, starch and darvan 821 A at an adjusted mass ratio to make slurry. The <b>slurries</b> were <b>cast</b> into cylindrical shaped molds and then dried for foaming and consolidation process. Subsequently, the dried bodies were burned at 600 degrees C for 1 h, followed by sintering at temperatures of 1300 - 1400 degrees C for 2 h. The porous alumina-HA composites with pore {{size in the}} range of 95 - 300 im and density of 2. 7 - 2. 9 g cm(- 3) were obtained. Porosity of bodies decreased from 31. 7 to 27. 6 when sintering temperatures increased from 1300 to 1400 degrees C. The increasing HA-to-alumina mass ratio from 0. 2 to 0. 8 w/w increased compressive strength of sintered bodies from 2. 3 to 10. 0 MPa. XRD pattern results show intensity of tricalcium phosphate (TCP) phase increased with sintering temperatures and also found that the sintering process did not alter phases in the porous bodies...|$|R
40|$|High-performance ceramic-based cathodes (e. g. NMC, LFP) are the {{backbone}} of lithium ion batteries. The production of cathodes is based on ceramic manufacturing technologies (powder processing, <b>slurry,</b> tape <b>casting).</b> The minimization of the water content in the fabricated battery is a crucial point in its manufacturing. This work {{is focused on the}} kinetics of water uptake in tape-cast cathode materials (NMC, LFP). The cathode foils were exposed to atmospheres with varying humidity and the water content was determined by means of coulometric Karl-Fischer titration. Conversely, the tendency of the cathodes to release residual water is examined. Additionally, electrochemical investigations were performed on cathode foils containing defined amounts of water. Galvanostatic charge-discharge experiments were conducted in 2 -electrode Swagelok® cells versus graphite anodes. It could be shown that the influence of residual water on the cell performance is very complex. On the one hand, the residual water causes side reactions. On the other hand, low water content obviously supports the formation of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on the anode...|$|R
40|$|Plastic fillers and powder-based {{aluminum}} composites typically use fly ash with {{a particle}} size {{of less than}} five microns. Clean ash classification generates a fine fraction, {approximately} 5 microns, and a coarse fraction, {approximately} 30 microns. There {{is a need to}} find additional uses for the coarser size fraction. Concrete is one area being studied in this project. Other possible applications in which a 30 -micron ceramic particle with good flowability is desired include ceramic <b>slurries</b> for investment <b>casting,</b> ceramic coatings for metal casting sand molds, and for use as a surfacing sand. If more information is obtained about these or other applications, it may be included in these reports...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{green tapes}} of Al 2 O 3 /glass {{composite}} were prepared by tape casting process using poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) as a binder. The {{results show that}} the <b>slurry</b> for tape <b>casting</b> exhibits a typical shear thinning behavior. The best pyrolysis procedure was found in nitrogen atmosphere to a maximum temperature of 600 °C. The dielectric constants are between 4. 6 and 7. 3 depending on the glass content. The dissipation factors are about 0. 2 % in the frequency range from 1 KHz to 1 MHz. The green tapes using PMMA as a binder can be sintered in nitrogen atmosphere for LTCC/Cu multilayer ceramic substrate...|$|R
