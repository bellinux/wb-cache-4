5|$|During the Second World War, silk {{supplies}} from Japan were cut off, so western countries {{were forced to}} find substitutes. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>fibres</b> such as nylon were used in products such as parachutes and stockings, replacing silk. Even after the war, silk {{was not able to}} regain many of the markets lost, though it remained an expensive luxury product. Postwar Japan, through improvements in technology and a protectionist market policy, became the world's foremost exporter of raw silk, a position it held until the 1970s. The continued rise in importance of <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres</b> and loosening of the protectionist economy contributed to the decline of Japan's silk industry, and by 1975 it was no longer a net exporter of silk.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{resources}} and fibres from plants {{are used to}} construct dwellings and to manufacture clothing. Wood is used not only for buildings, boats, and furniture, but also for smaller items such as musical instruments and sports equipment. Wood is pulped to make paper and cardboard. Cloth is often made from cotton, flax, ramie or <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres</b> such as rayon and acetate derived from plant cellulose. Thread used to sew cloth likewise comes in large part from cotton.|$|E
5|$|Football kit {{has evolved}} {{significantly}} {{since the early}} days of the sport when players typically wore thick cotton shirts, knickerbockers and heavy rigid leather boots. In the twentieth century, boots became lighter and softer, shorts were worn at a shorter length, and advances in clothing manufacture and printing allowed shirts to be made in lighter <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres</b> with increasingly colourful and complex designs. With the rise of advertising in the 20th century, sponsors' logos began to appear on shirts, and replica strips were made available for fans to purchase, generating significant amounts of revenue for clubs.|$|E

5|$|The Welsh uplands {{were most}} suited to grazing {{animals such as}} sheep and goats, and the animals became {{associated}} with Wales. Sheep-farming {{on a large scale}} was introduced by Cistercian monks, largely for wool, but also for meat. By the start of the 16th century Welsh mutton was popular {{in the rest of the}} UK. Once modern <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres</b> became more popular than wool, Welsh sheep were raised almost exclusively for meat. Towards the end of the 20th century, there were more than 11 million sheep in Wales. The most popular breed of sheep is the Welsh Mountain sheep which is notably smaller than other breeds but better-suited to the Welsh landscape and only rears one lamb, rather than the lowland breeds which rear two or more; the mountain sheep are regarded as having more flavoursome meat. Welsh farmers have started using scientific methods, such as artificial insemination or using ultrasound to scan a sheep's depth of fat, to improve the quality of their meat.|$|E
25|$|During this period, {{the island}} enjoyed {{increased}} {{revenues from the}} sale of flax, with prices peaking in 1951. However, the industry declined because of transport costs and competition from <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres.</b> The decision by the British Post Office to use <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres</b> for its mailbags was a further blow, contributing to the closure of the island's flax mills in 1965.|$|E
25|$|Yarn can be, and is, spun from a {{wide variety}} of materials, {{including}} natural fibres such as animal, plant, and mineral fibres, and <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres.</b> It was probably first made from plant fibres, but animal fibres soon followed.|$|E

50|$|After World War II, {{steel plates}} were soon {{replaced}} by vests made from <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibre,</b> in the 1950s, made of either boron carbide, silicon carbide, or aluminium oxide. They were issued {{to the crew}} of low-flying aircraft, such as the UH-1 and UC-123, during the Vietnam War. The <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibre</b> Kevlar was introduced in 1971, and most ballistic vests since the 1970s are based on kevlar, optionally {{with the addition of}} trauma plates {{to reduce the risk of}} blunt trauma injury. Such plates may be made of ceramic, metal (steel or titanium) or synthetic materials.|$|R
25|$|Carpet can be {{formulated}} {{from many}} single or blended natural and <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres.</b> Fibres are chosen for durability, appearance, ease of manufacture, and cost. In terms of scale of production, the dominant yarn constructions are polyamides (nylons) and polypropylene {{with an estimated}} 90% of the commercial market.|$|E
25|$|Increases in {{size and}} speed allowed vessels to fish in more distant waters. Advances include double trawls, the Puretic power blocks for {{retrieving}} seine nets, refrigerated holds, durable <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres</b> for lines and nets, GPS to navigate and locate fishing grounds, fishfinders for the location of fish, and spotter planes to locate fish schools.|$|E
25|$|In 1955, {{after the}} {{adoption}} of the first post-war slum clearance plan, new housing estates were built to replace the slums and, gradually, redundant textile mills were occupied by firms in the various light industries. New applications of engineering principles, the manufacture of rubber goods, plastics, chemicals and packaging materials were all introduced, as well as the addition of <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres</b> to the textile trade, reducing unemployment.|$|E
40|$|For {{deep and}} ultra-deepwater applications, <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibre</b> ropes are {{considered}} an enabling technology {{due to their}} higher strength-to-weight ratio as compared to steel wire ropes and chains and due to their superior station-keeping performance. The advantages of <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibre</b> rope mooring systems include: • A higher floater payload and reduction in structural costs due to lower vertical load from mooring lines. • A reduction in vessel offsets and associated riser loads due to taut mooring system. • A potential reduction in installation costs due to lighter installation and handling equipment. • Superior endurance under cyclic loading compared to steel moorings...|$|R

50|$|As {{part of the}} Petrochemical Division of the Malaysian oil giant Petronas, PCF(K)SB's {{primary product}} is {{granular}} urea, with ammonia and methanol as secondary by-products of the manufacturing process. Currently, the plant has a rated urea output of 2100 MT per day. PCF(K)SB's urea product is also used in the manufacturing process of additional derivative petrochemicals such as plastics, glue, <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibre,</b> <b>synthetic</b> rubber and lubricants.|$|R
25|$|The {{introduction}} of fine <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres</b> such as nylon {{in the construction}} of fishing gear during the 1960s marked an expansion in the commercial use of gillnets. The new materials were cheaper and easier to handle, lasted longer and required less maintenance than natural fibres. In addition, multifilament nylon, monofilament or multimonofilament fibres become almost invisible in water, so nets made with synthetic twines generally caught greater numbers of fish than natural fibre nets used in comparable situations.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the world's PET production is for <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres</b> (in excess of 60%), with bottle production accounting for about 30% of global demand. In the context of textile applications, PET is referred to by its common name, polyester, whereas the acronym PET is generally used in relation to packaging. Polyester makes up about 18% of world polymer production and is the fourth-most-produced polymer; polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) are first, second and third, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Spinning is {{an ancient}} textile art in which plant, animal or <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres</b> are drawn out and twisted {{together}} to form yarn. For thousands of years, fibre was spun by hand using simple tools, the spindle and distaff. It was only with {{the invention of the}} spinning wheel in India, and its subsequent introduction to Europe in the High Middle Ages, did the output of individual spinners dramatically increase. Mass production only arose in the 18th century with the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution. Hand-spinning remains a popular handicraft.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "St Michael" [...] brand was {{introduced}} by Simon Marks in 1928 in honour {{of his father and}} co-founder of Marks & Spencer, Michael Marks. By 1950, virtually all goods were sold under the St Michael brand. M lingerie, women's clothing and girls' uniform were branded under the St Margaret brand, until the whole range of general merchandise became St Michael. The <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibre</b> Tricell was first used in 1957 and lasted until the 1970s. and another <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibre</b> called Courtelle was first launched, nationally, by Marks & Spencer during 1960 and also lasted well into the 1970s. Machine washable wool first appeared in 1972 and Lycra hosiery first came in during 1986.|$|R
40|$|During {{a routine}} flock visit, a farmer {{observed}} {{that one of}} the eight tooth Bapedi rams had been losing body condition despite being separated from the flock and fed supplementary feed. The ram’s body condition score was assessed as 2 out of 5 (one point less than the average {{of the rest of the}} rams) and the teeth appeared normal with no excessive wear. The rumen was assessed by auscultation, palpation and ballottement where a foreign body (approximately 20 cm × 5 cm – 10 cm) was clearly palpated and ballotted. A rumenotomy was performed and a large mass of tightly compacted foreign matter and plant material was removed. The mass consisted of <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibre,</b> plant material and calcium phosphate (50. 5 %). It appeared to have formed as the result of the ingestion of a <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibre</b> which formed the nidus of a concretion. This was probably the result of deficient nutrition, with the rams eating the <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibre</b> in an attempt to increase feed intake. The ram recovered uneventfully after the rumenotomy was performed and supplementary feeding. The authors would like to thank the Nutrilab Facility, Department of Animal and Wildlife Sciences, University of Pretoria, for analysis of the rumenolith. [URL]...|$|R
25|$|Lancaster is {{primarily}} a service-oriented city. Products of Lancaster include animal feed, textiles, chemicals, livestock, paper, <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibre,</b> farm machinery, HGV trailers and mineral fibres.

25|$|Other {{regional}} {{products are}} wicker baskets {{and pieces of}} furniture. The cultivation of osier (salix sp), which is native to European and Asiancold and temperate regions, was proposed by Sarmiento because it can resist floods. Another plant that adapts to floodable lands is New Zealand flax (phormium tenax), which was industrialised as from 1925 and is used in containers, burlap, cords, threads, runners and mats. By {{the end of the}} 20th century, the competence with <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres</b> made New Zealand flax plantations anti-economic. Fishing and coypu breeding are other economic activities that are no longer attractive.|$|E
500|$|Economic {{development}} was advanced by ship resupplying and sheep farming for high-quality wool. The main sheep breeds in the Falkland Islands are Polwarth and Corriedale. During the 1980s, although <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres</b> and ranch underinvestment hurt the sheep-farming sector, the government established a major revenue stream {{with the establishment}} of an exclusive economic zone and the sale of fishing licenses to [...] "anybody wishing to fish within this zone". Since the end of the Falklands War in 1982, the islands' economic activity has increasingly focused on oil field exploration and tourism.|$|E
500|$|An {{oil shale}} {{research}} institute (now a department within Tallinn University of Technology) was founded at Kohtla-Järve in 1958. Preliminary research into oil shale-based chemical production began the same year, exploring {{the potential for}} the use of oil shale in bitumen, synthetic construction materials, detergents, synthetic leathers, <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres,</b> plastics, paints, soaps, glues, and pesticides. Between 1959 and 1985, [...] of mineral wool were produced from oil shale coke, a solid residue of oil shale. In 1968, a branch of the Skochinsky Institute of Mining was established in Kohtla-Järve, and in 1984 the scientific-technical journal Oil Shale was founded in Estonia.|$|E
50|$|Reliance Industries {{and other}} textile {{manufactures}} set up <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibre</b> plants in India significantly reducing {{the price of}} <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibre</b> and the Indian middle class jumped at {{the opportunity to be}} well dressed in a fabric which though unsuited to India's climate was fairly cheap, easy to maintain and long-lasting. The safari suit continued to be the de facto business attire, particularly in government/public sectors and the SMB arena in India, through the late-1990s. With India's growth over the 1990s, liberalization and with the middle class suddenly having more disposable income, the younger generations began to gravitate towards more modern western fashions such as suits and other business attire. Although it is still visible in some parts of India, the Safari suit is now indelibly associated with the so-called License Raj - the slow, inefficient Indian bureaucracy of the 1970s and the 1980s.|$|R
50|$|DuPont, {{founded by}} Éleuthère Irénée du Pont, first {{produced}} gunpowder and later cellulose-based paints. Following WWI, DuPont produced synthetic ammonia and other chemicals. DuPont began experimenting {{with the development}} of cellulose based fibres, eventually producing the <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibre</b> rayon. DuPont's experience with rayon was an important precursor to its development and marketing of nylon.|$|R
50|$|In India, the safari suit gained {{popularity}} {{through the}} 1970s influenced {{to a large}} degree by films (James Bond/Roger Moore) and some fashions trends from the west for warmer climates. The safari suit in India gained prominence when local <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibre</b> manufacture and supply was significantly increased in the later half of the 1970s.|$|R
500|$|The {{discovery}} of man-made synthetic dyes in {{the mid-19th century}} triggered a long decline in the large-scale market for natural dyes. [...] Synthetic dyes, which could be produced in large quantities, quickly superseded natural dyes for the commercial textile production enabled by the industrial revolution, and unlike natural dyes, were suitable for the <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres</b> that followed. [...] Artists of the Arts and Crafts Movement preferred the pure shades and subtle variability of natural dyes, which mellow with age but preserve their true colors, unlike early synthetic dyes, and helped ensure that the old European techniques for dyeing and printing with natural dyestuffs were preserved for use by home and craft dyers. [...] Natural dyeing techniques are also preserved by artisans in traditional cultures around the world.|$|E
500|$|Acetic acid is {{the second}} {{simplest}} carboxylic acid (after formic acid). [...] It consists of a methyl group attached to a carboxyl group. It is an important chemical reagent and industrial chemical, used primarily {{in the production of}} cellulose acetate for photographic film, polyvinyl acetate for wood glue, and <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres</b> and fabrics. In households, diluted acetic acid is often used in descaling agents. In the food industry, acetic acid is controlled by the food additive code E260 as an acidity regulator and as a condiment. As a food additive it is approved for usage in many countries, including Canada, the European Union, the United States, Australia and New Zealand. In biochemistry, the acetyl group, derived from acetic acid, is fundamental to all forms of life. When bound to coenzyme A, it is central to the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats.|$|E
2500|$|Wool has {{excellent}} durability, can be dyed {{easily and}} is fairly abundant. When blended with <b>synthetic</b> <b>fibres</b> such as nylon {{the durability of}} wool is increased. Blended wool yarns are extensively used in production of modern carpet, with the most common blend being 80% wool to 20% synthetic fibre, giving rise to the term [...] "80/20". Wool is relatively expensive and consequently it only comprises {{a small portion of}} the market.|$|E
25|$|Modern buried pipe drains often {{consist of}} corrugated, flexible, and {{perforated}} plastic (PE or PVC) pipe lines wrapped with an envelope or filter material {{to improve the}} permeability around the pipes and to prevent entry of soil particles, which is especially important in fine sandy and silty soils.
