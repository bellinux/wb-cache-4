5|$|At the hospital, Homer sees a candy machine and, {{while trying}} to get chocolate, accidentally tips it on himself. The machine crushes him and puts him in a coma. After that, Mr. Burns then tries {{to pull the plug}} on Homer's life support system to keep from having to pay for Homer's health insurance. As Homer lies {{unconscious}} in the hospital bed, Bart tearfully confesses that {{he was the one who}} put him in the hospital with his shaken beer can prank. Having heard this, Homer comes out of the coma and ends up strangling Bart for his prank. Despite this, Marge and the others are happy that Homer is finally well. The episode ends with Homer, still under the assumption that it is April Fools' Day, trying to fool the family by saying he is taking them to Hawaii. However, Bart, Lisa, and Marge tell Homer that the current date is May 16, that Homer was in a coma for 7 weeks, and that he lost 5% of his brain as a result. The family laughs it off even though Homer's not <b>sure</b> <b>why</b> he is laughing.|$|E
25|$|Sure, {{there have}} been controversies as well. Naya Daur (right) was one instance, thanks to the Madhubala episode. She was a fine person, it was merely that in this one instance, things went badly wrong. For my film she did about ten days work and then her father refused {{to allow her to}} go {{outdoors}} {{for the rest of the}} shoot - I was never <b>sure</b> <b>why.</b> So we took Vyjayanthimala for the role and her father filed a suit against us.|$|E

500|$|After {{recording}} two studio albums in Sapporo, {{the band}} moved to Tokyo in spring 2009 {{to further their}} musical potential. Their first album produced in Tokyo, Shin-shiro (2009), saw a new approach for the band, where vocalist Ichiro Yamaguchi asked {{the other members of}} Sakanaction to arrange songs individually, instead of together. Led by the singles [...] "Sen to Rei" [...] and [...] "Native Dancer", the album became their most commercially successful in their career, peaking at number eight on Oricon's album chart. Despite this, Yamaguchi was disappointed with the sales, and was not <b>sure</b> <b>why</b> the album stalled at 30,000 copies sold.|$|E
500|$|The {{immediate}} {{reaction was}} mixed {{among members of}} Congress. Democratic supporters of the ruling were optimistic of future victories against funding restrictions, stating that, while they were glad the restriction fell, [...] " [...] opens the LSC up to even more attacks". Republicans in Congress condemned the decision, agreeing to work against it. Representative Steve Largent (R-OK) said, [...] "It'll be {{on the radar screen}} for <b>sure</b> ... <b>Why</b> are we giving taxpayer money to sue taxpayers?" [...] The New York Times described the decision {{as the end of the}} [...] "latest chapter, although almost certainly not the last, in a long political struggle over the federally financed program of civil legal services for the poor." ...|$|E

500|$|Reception of the preview {{release of}} RT 8.1 was mixed; both ExtremeTech and TechRadar praised the {{improvements}} to the operating system's tablet-oriented interface, along {{with the addition of}} Outlook; TechRadars Dan Grabham believed that the inclusion of Outlook was important because [...] "nobody {{in their right mind would}} try and handle work email inside the standard Mail app—it's just not up to the task." [...] However, both experienced performance issues running the beta on the Tegra 3-based Surface; ExtremeTech concluded that [...] "as it stands, we’re still not <b>sure</b> <b>why</b> you would ever opt to buy a Windows RT tablet when there are similarly priced Atom-powered x86 devices that run the full version of Windows 8." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{retrospective}} interview {{on the album}} with Rockin' On Japan in 2011, Yamaguchi believed that many aspects of Sakanaction were not represented on the album, and felt that songs such as [...] "Light Dance", [...] "Zattō" [...] and [...] "Enough" [...] only showed surface-level Sakanaction. The album's comparative commercial success created an odd feeling for the band, as even though it sold many more copies than their previous works, they were not <b>sure</b> <b>why</b> it had stopped selling at 30,000 copies. As {{a result of the}} album's disappointing sales, Yamaguchi felt that Sakanaction needed to create a signature song that would be recognisable to a wide audience and would represent Sakanaction as a band, and spent most of 2009 experimenting on the song [...] "Aruku Around" [...] (2010), released as the band's next single after Shin-shiro.|$|E
500|$|The {{reasons given}} for this {{rejection}} also varied. According to Vitullo-Martin, writing in The Wall Street Journal, Shmuel Spiegel was not <b>sure</b> <b>why</b> the offers were rejected, as the records were [...] "buried in the rubble". Vitullo-Martin speculated that congregants might have hesitated {{to agree to}} a condition that they would need permission from the state for any sale or alteration of the building during the following 20 years. According to The New York Times, Spiegel stated that the repairs required were so extensive that the congregation could not have made them even with this financial assistance. According to The Jewish Week, Spiegel stated that the congregation [...] "didn't want outside interference", was [...] "uncomfortable with the idea of being landmarked and having to answer to landmark guidelines", and was also uncomfortable with making part of the building into a [...] "museum of past glory", as others nearby had done.|$|E

500|$|Staci Krause of IGN {{had mixed}} {{perspectives}} on the episode's story arcs, comparing the advanced development in the personal story lines {{to the introduction of}} disappointing medical cases. She described the story line involving Yang and Burke's silent relationship as [...] "finally showing resolution, taking pleasure to the next level", adding: [...] "It was shocking to see Cristina be the one to break, but even more shocking was Burke's two-word response: marry me. I'm really not <b>sure</b> <b>why</b> Cristina didn't just say yes, since two minutes before had said she was in it for the long haul. It seems like they are dragging this out for the sake of dragging it out." [...] Bailey's evolution in the episode, mainly her interactions with four competing attending physicians, were described as [...] "a reminder of why they called her the Nazi, something that was easy to forget with recent events." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Girly Edition" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by critics. It {{was named the}} fifth best episode with a sports theme of the series by Jerry Greene of the Orlando Sentinel. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, thought well of the episode, calling it [...] "a great episode, full of more than the normal quota of good jokes", adding, [...] "best of all is Lisa's revenge on Bart, and the mad cat-lady who goes around chucking her cats at people." [...] Ryan Keefer of DVD Verdict gave the episode a B rating and stated that he enjoyed the subplot with Mojo more than the main plot. Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide commented that [...] "Girly Edition" [...] takes [...] "a clever concept and turns into something more than expected as it digs into the usual Bart/Lisa rivalry. I’m not quite <b>sure</b> <b>why</b> Bart reacts so sadly to Lisa’s comments about his stupidity when 'Lisa the Simpson' just delved into the dumbness of the male Simpsons. There’s enough to like here to make the episode fun, though." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first draft}} of the script of The Orphanage was written by Sergio G. Sánchez in 1996. Sánchez was not <b>sure</b> <b>why</b> he chose to write a genre film for the screenplay, as he explains, [...] "I ended up writing a film {{in the style of}} those I liked as a kid, movies like Poltergeist, The Omen, and Rosemary's Baby which I ruined on the first VCR we owned at home." [...] Sánchez {{revealed}} the literary influences underlying his writing of the script, such as The Turn of the Screw and Peter Pan. Sánchez originally wanted to direct the script but he was repeatedly turned down by various Spanish production companies. While Sánchez was working on the short film 7337 in 2004, he met with director Juan Antonio Bayona and offered him the script to direct. Bayona accepted the opportunity [...] because he felt that a fantasy themed script like that of The Orphanage would allow him freedom as a director, saying the fantasy genre was a great tool for learning as it [...] "allows manipulation of space and time as we wish or the use of certain camera moves with an immediate efficiency".|$|E

500|$|The song {{attracted}} widespread praise {{by music}} critics, {{many of whom}} ranked it among West's best songs. [...] Pitchfork Media's Ryan Dombal compared elements of the song to the rock band The Strokes, and stated that it contained {{some of the best}} lyrics ever written by West. Dan Vidal of URB largely praised the track, writing that it was an excellent song overall, though wrote that [...] "in my personal opinion, I don’t really think Kid Cudi can sing; and I’m not <b>sure</b> <b>why</b> his generally off-key caterwauling is appealing to people, but here it’s hypnotically on point – matching perfectly with the track’s imposing tone." [...] MTV wrote that the song featured West at his most boastful lyrically, musing that [...] "while his lyrics are razor sharp, the production here is softer, resulting in a melodic finger wag to his naysayers rather than searing jabs." [...] David Amidon of PopMatters praised the performance by West on the song but felt that neither guest appearance ultimately left much of an impression. On the other hand, Sputnikmusic's Channing Freeman felt that both Cudi and Raekwon fit perfectly on the guitar-driven track.|$|E
500|$|Fallout 4: Far Harbor was {{released}} to [...] "generally favorable" [...] reviews, {{according to the}} review aggregator Metacritic. The new quests drew praise from reviewers, though the puzzle sections were criticized. In particular, Dan Stapleton (IGN) expressed admiration for the new quests but said that the puzzle rooms were [...] "so hard to fail I'm not <b>sure</b> <b>why</b> Bethesda bothered". He also mentioned that the Far Harbor expansion contained some of the strongest quest content in Fallout 4. Peter Brown (GameSpot) commended the addition of [...] "hours of side quests driven by curious characters", and the staff at Game Central agreed. Matt Wittaker (Hardcore Gamer) appreciated the quests: he praised the main questline for its focus on [...] "moral ambiguity and tough choices", saying that that was what Fallout fans were seeking. The reviewers for Game Revolution and GameCentral disliked the puzzles, as did Jack de Quidt (Rock, Paper, Shotgun) who regarded them as very frustrating even though he felt they were [...] "a {{small part of the}} release". Both de Quidt and the Game Revolution reviewer considered the engine insufficient for the intricate puzzle sequences. Several reviewers made comparisons to the video game Minecraft when talking about the block-related content added in the expansion.|$|E
500|$|Thorpe's {{comeback}} {{attempt in}} the 200m freestyle {{came to an}} abrupt end on day 2 of Australia's Olympic Trials in Adelaide, on 16 March 2012. No longer allowed to wear the full-body racing suit (covering from neck to ankles and wrists) with which he set all of his world records– but are now banned by FINA rule changes– he competed wearing just the [...] "jammer" [...] (hip to thigh) racing shorts. He swam very well in the morning heats, cruising to 1:49.18, a time which placed him equal fifth fastest. However, in the semi-finals that evening he faded over the last 100 meters, finishing in 12th place at 1:49.91. Speaking to reporters immediately afterwards, Thorpe said, [...] "The last 100 was a struggle, I'm not <b>sure</b> <b>why.</b> This was slower than what I swam this morning, probably the inexperience of racing in the last 18 months held me up. The fairytale has turned into a nightmare." [...] In the 100m freestyle on day 3 (17 March), Thorpe won his heat (the 9th of 12) but failed to break 50 seconds and did not advance to the semi-finals with the top 16 sprinters. Thus, his bid to qualify for the London Olympics officially ended.|$|E

500|$|The {{entire staff}} agrees to pool their points towards Andy's butt tattoo, {{and the office}} {{suddenly}} becomes a hubbub of activity, with Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) even giving up his nap-time to make sales calls for Sabre's new Pyramid tablet. To Andy's great dismay, they earn 5,000 points {{by the end of}} the day. When Andy and the crew go to the tattoo parlor, Andy backs down and admits to Jim that he is not <b>sure</b> <b>why</b> Robert made him manager. Jim reassures Andy that he managed to pick up sales, and that no one in the office expects him to go through with the tattoo idea. Pepped up by Jim's talk, Andy enthusiastically agrees to getting the tattoo, which Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) changes, without telling Andy, to an image of a dog that has [...] "Nard" [...] written on it, a reference to Andy's nickname [...] "Nard Dog." [...] Upon seeing his completed tattoo in a mirror, Andy is pleased with the result. Robert then reveals to the cameras that he picked Andy because he is an uncomplicated choice which causes people to rally behind him, because he is an underdog. Meanwhile, Pam and Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) become walking buddies at Angela's request, but after Angela says she's reported Pam to Social Services for drinking herbal tea out of coffee mugs while pregnant, a disgusted Pam tells Angela they should not have anything else to do with each other.|$|E
500|$|The pilot commences with Dexter {{driving through}} Miami, summarizing, in a monologue, that {{something}} is to occur on that night. After a choir performance at a bandstand, Dexter kidnaps Mike Donovan (Jim Abele), a pastor who rapes and murders young boys, takes him to a remote cabin in the Everglades, and forces him {{to look at the}} bodies of his victims. Before sedating him, Dexter explains that he could never kill a child, because he abides by a moral code. Later, Donovan awakes to find himself strapped to a table. Dexter makes an incision in Donovan's cheek with a scalpel and collects his blood in a slide, and then proceeds to kill him. Dexter, returning from dumping Donovan's remains, narrates that he is not <b>sure</b> <b>why</b> he feels the need to kill, and speaks of his adoptive parents, Harry and Doris Morgan, both of whom are dead. He also believes himself to be emotionally detached from other people. [...] At his apartment, Dexter stores Donovan's blood in a case containing the blood of his other victims. Dexter explains that he kills according to a code taught to him by his foster father who, as a Miami police officer, instructed Dexter on how to avoid being caught, and to kill only those who [...] "deserve it". Flashbacks throughout the episode reveal that Harry first decided to impart these [...] "lessons" [...] upon Dexter after discovering that the boy had been killing neighborhood pets.|$|E
