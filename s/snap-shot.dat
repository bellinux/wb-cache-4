5|$|Barcelona {{kicked the}} match off, but Manchester United showed their intent from the outset, forcing goalkeeper Víctor Valdés to concede a throw-in after just 10 seconds. Further {{pressure}} on the attack resulted in Yaya Touré fouling Anderson within Cristiano Ronaldo's shooting range. Ronaldo fired the free kick directly at Valdés, but the Spanish goalkeeper could only parry the ball and Gerard Piqué did well to divert Park Ji-sung's follow-up effort over the bar. The resulting corner was cleared, but {{only as far as}} Wayne Rooney, whose <b>snap-shot</b> was wayward and went out for a goal kick.|$|E
5|$|United won {{a corner}} {{just as the}} fourth {{official}} indicated three minutes of injury time, and with so little time left for an equaliser, Peter Schmeichel ventured up to Bayern's penalty area. Beckham flighted the corner in just over Schmeichel's head, Dwight Yorke put the ball back towards the crowded area, and after Thorsten Fink failed to clear sufficiently, the ball arrived {{at the feet of}} Ryan Giggs {{on the edge of the}} area. His right-footed <b>snap-shot</b> was weak and poorly struck, but it went straight to Sheringham, who swiped at the shot with his right foot, and nestled the ball in the bottom corner of the net. The goal was timed at 90+0:36'. It looked as if, having been behind for most of the match, United had forced extra time.|$|E

60|$|I {{wanted that}} tooth. Also, Martin wanted a <b>snap-shot</b> of me getting it. Likewise Charmian got her camera. Then the {{procession}} started. We were stopping at {{what had been}} the club-house when Stevenson was in the Marquesas on the Casco. On the veranda, where he had passed so many pleasant hours, the light was not good--for snapshots, I mean. I led on into the garden, a chair in one hand, the other hand filled with forceps of various sorts, my knees knocking together disgracefully. The poor old Chinaman came second, and he was shaking, too. Charmian and Martin brought up the rear, armed with kodaks. We dived under the avocado trees, threaded our way through the cocoanut palms, and came on a spot that satisfied Martin's photographic eye.|$|E

Jones {{scrambled}} up the steep, slippery place, and upon arriving at the ridge, which took several moments of hard work, he looked everywhere for the wolf. In a moment he saw the animal, standing still some hundred or more paces down a hollow. With the quick report of Jones's second shot, the wolf fell and rolled over. The hunter ran to the spot to find the wolf was dead. Taking hold of a front paw, he dragged the animal over the snow to camp. Rea began to skin the animal, when suddenly he exclaimed: ...|$|E

6000|$|As I came up {{the steps}} I had a glimpse of Mr. Gabbitas {{printing}} photographs by candle light in his room. It was the chief delight of his little life to spend his holiday abroad {{in the company of}} a queer little <b>snap-shot</b> camera, and to return with a great multitude of foggy and sinister negatives that he had made in beautiful and interesting places. These the camera company would develop for him on advantageous terms, and he would spend his evenings the year through in printing from them in order to inflict copies upon his undeserving friends. There was a long frameful of his work in the Clayton National School, for example, inscribed in old English lettering, [...] "Italian Travel Pictures, by the Rev. E. B. Gabbitas." [...] For this it seemed he lived and traveled and had his being. It was his only real joy.
