40|$|CheY is the {{response}} regulator protein that {{interacts with the}} flagellar <b>switch</b> <b>apparatus</b> to modulate flagellar rotation during chemotactic signaling. CheY can be phosphorylated and dephosphorylated in vitro, and evidence indicates that CheY-P is the activated form that induces clockwise flagellar rotation, resulting in a tumble in the cell's swimming pattern. The flagellar <b>switch</b> <b>apparatus</b> is a complex macromolecular structure composed {{of at least three}} gene products, FliG, FliM, and FliN. Genetic analysis of Escherichia coli has identified fliG and fliM as genes in which mutations occur that allele specifically suppress cheY mutations, indicating interactions among these gene products. We have generated a class of cheY mutations selected for dominant suppression of fliG mutations. Interestingly, these cheY mutations dominantly suppressed both fliG and fliM mutations; {{this is consistent with the}} idea that the CheY protein interacts with both switch gene products during signaling. Biochemical characterization of wild-type and suppressor CheY proteins did not reveal altered phosphorylation properties or evidence for phosphorylation-dependent CheY multimerization. These data indicate that suppressor CheY proteins are specifically altered in the ability to transduce chemotactic signals to the switch at some point subsequent to phosphorylation. Physical mapping of suppressor amino acid substitutions on the crystal structure of CheY revealed a high degree of spatial clustering, suggesting that this region of CheY is a signaling surface that transduces chemotactic signals to the switch...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been made}} of reversible electrical breakdown in amorphous chalcogenides with particular attention being paid to the on-state properties of Si 12 Te 48 As 30 Ge 10 glass threshold <b>switches.</b> <b>Apparatus</b> is described for the preparation of well-characterised materials and flash-evaporated thin-film switching devices. Measurements have been made of the current-voltage characteristics, including the effect of variation of thermal boundary conditions on the stability and form of the on-state behaviour. All tested devices have been found to undergo a forming process which is attributed to structural changes in the device material. These structural changes have been substantiated by measurements on virgin and formed devices of (i) off-state resistance as a function of number of switching operations, (ii) off-state resistance as a function of electrode contact area, (iii) device conductance versus frequency and (v) the effect of uniaxial pressure on device off-state current. The results satisfy a model for a formed device {{in which there is a}} highly conducting and inhomogeneous filamentary region surrounded by a low-conducting glass. It is shown that when the thermal conductivity of the device electrode material is two or three orders of magnitude greater than that of the switching glass, the magnitude of the minimum holding voltage is proportional to the square root of the thermal conductivity of the electrode material. This observation is consistent with a thermal constriction model where the minimum holding voltage is the sum of the voltage drops across the filament constrictions at electrode/glass interfaces. The holding current is shown to be a linear function of ambient temperature and extrapolates to zero at a temperature similar to that for a threshold voltage - temperature plot. Photographic recordings of the current-voltage characteristics of the switching devices have shown that the on-state of a formed device consists of several distinct branches depending on the switching history of the device and the electrode materials. The multiply-branched on-state is interpreted in terms of sequential forming of current channels between tellurium-crystallite clusters and the electrodes. Several mechanisms are discussed to explain the origin of these current channels and the localized thermal breakdown mechanism is considered to be the most favourable one...|$|R

40|$|The {{pathogenic}} bacterium Shigella flexneri uses a type III secretion system to inject virulence factors from the bacterial cytosol directly into host cells. The machinery that identifies secretion substrates and controls {{the export of}} extracellular components and effector proteins consists of several inner-membrane and cytoplasmic proteins. One of the inner membrane components, Spa 40, belongs to a family of proteins proposed to regulate the switching of substrate specificity of the export apparatus. We show that Spa 40 is cleaved within the strictly conserved amino acid sequence NPTH and substitution of the proposed autocatalytic residue abolishes cleavage. Here we also report the crystal structure of the cytoplasmic complex Spa 40 (C) and compare it with the recent structures of the homologues from Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. These structures reveal the tight association of the cleaved fragments and show that the conserved NPTH sequence lies on a loop which, when cleaved, swings away from the catalytic N 257 residue, resulting in different surface features in this region. This structural rearrangement suggests a mechanism by which non-cleaving forms of these proteins interfere with correct substrate <b>switching</b> of the <b>apparatus...</b>|$|R

50|$|Diesel, PPC and HCCI engines, rely {{solely on}} heat and {{pressure}} created by the engine in its compression process for ignition. The compression level that occurs is usually twice or more than a gasoline engine. Diesel engines take in air only, and shortly before peak compression, spray a small quantity of diesel fuel into the cylinder via a fuel injector that allows the fuel to instantly ignite. HCCI type engines take in both air and fuel, but continue to rely on an unaided auto-combustion process, due to higher pressures and heat. This is also why diesel and HCCI engines {{are more susceptible to}} cold-starting issues, although they run just as well in cold weather once started. Light duty diesel engines with indirect injection in automobiles and light trucks employ glowplugs (or other pre-heating: see Cummins ISB#6BT) that pre-heat the combustion chamber just before starting to reduce no-start conditions in cold weather. Most diesels also have a battery and charging system; nevertheless, this system is secondary and is added by manufacturers as a luxury for the ease of starting, turning fuel on and off (which can also be done via a <b>switch</b> or mechanical <b>apparatus),</b> and for running auxiliary electrical components and accessories. Most new engines rely on electrical and electronic engine control units (ECU) that also adjust the combustion process to increase efficiency and reduce emissions.|$|R

Three different apparatus, a Waring blender, a <b>switching</b> <b>apparatus,</b> and an ultrasonic processor, were evaluated to verify the efficiency of extraction. The analytical methods proposed involve the extraction with chloroform-orthophosphoric acid, cleanup through an immunoaffinity column, high-performance liquid chromatography/fluorescence detection for separation and identification of OTA, and confirmation with liquid chromatography/FD after methylation of OTA in muscle tissue. The limit of quantification of the proposed method was 0. 04 µg kg- 1.

Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) is a genetic defect of the adrenal glands. It originates by 21 -hydroxylase deficiency causing abnormal production of 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (17 -OHP) and androstenedione. In the neonatal period {{it can lead}} to salt wasting crisis that, without a timely diagnosis, could be dangerous up to death. The average occurrence of this kind of pathology is one case out of 15000 newborns, whereas in our medical district it is considerably higher. Its recognition can be obtained by plotting the ratio 17 -OHP plus androstendione divided by cortisol Vs. 17 -OHP concentration. Sample preparation involves the extraction of the analytes from dried blood spots (DBS) by methanol, containing the internal standard, and on-line SPE, which makes use of a perfusion column Applied Biosystems POROS 2. 1 x 30 mm.

40|$|Waxes are {{a widely}} used {{chemical}} commodity {{throughout the world}} due to certain intrinsic properties. Applications vary widely, including such obvious ones as candles and polishes, less obviously coatings, ink, and cosmetics, and more obscurely, hot melt adhesives, textile processing and chewing gum. The waxes used are obtained {{from a variety of}} sources, natural, mineral, and synthetic. The properties of the wax determine its suitability for a particular application. For certain of the latter, a wax containing Oxygen groups is often the most appropriate type. While {{there are a number of}} such waxes that occur naturally, there are also many more in which the raw wax has undergone oxidation by chemical processes. Generally, this is done utilising elevated temperatures, and passing air or oxygen through the wax. Oxidation then takes place via a free radical process. Singlet molecular oxygen is a higher-energy state species of oxygen, in which the two electrons in the π* 2 p antibonding molecular orbitals, while remaining unpaired, are excited to antiparallel spin. Reactions of singlet oxygen are very site-speciﬁc, resulting in more speciﬁc products compared to the free radical process. It was considered that oxidation of waxes by reaction with singlet oxygen might produce different products compared to the thermal oxidation, and also compared to oxidation using ozone. An apparatus was set up to test this theory. The singlet oxygen was generated by passing a stream of oxygen through a microwave beam to form a plasma, the resulting singlet oxygen-containing gas being reacted with molten wax. Optimisation of the setup was performed before performing reactions, using several different waxes. The experiments were duplicated by ones with the microwave switched off, so that any results could be ascribed to the presence of singlet oxygen, and not normal oxygen. A similar apparatus was set up to react the same waxes with ozone, the latter being generated by passing oxygen through an electrical discharge-type generator. Blank runs with the electric discharge <b>apparatus</b> <b>switched</b> off, were also carried out to be able to distinguish any reaction due to the unozonised oxygen. The results showed that the singlet oxygen only reacted with a particular type of wax, namely oxidised polyethylene wax (AC 6 - 29), although other effects were caused by the heat of the plasma. The ozone, on the other hand, reacted readily with all types of waxes tested. Other experiments were also conducted to investigate the use of microwave technology for chemical purposes, including development of an analytical method for saponification value determination in which microwaves replaced conventional heating...|$|R

40|$|Politically the Colorado {{river is}} an interstate {{as well as}} an {{international}} stream. Physically the basin divides itself distinctly into three sections. The upper section from head waters to the mouth of San Juan comprises about 40 percent of the total of the basin and affords about 87 percent of the total runoff, or an average of about 15 000 000 acre feet per annum. High mountains and cold weather are found in this section. The middle section from the mouth of San Juan to the mouth of the Williams comprises about 35 percent of the total area of the basin and supplies about 7 percent of the annual runoff. Narrow canyons and mild weather prevail in this section. The lower third of the basin is composed of mainly hot arid plains of low altitude. It comprises some 25 percent of the total area of the basin and furnishes about 6 percent of the average annual runoff. The proposed Diamond Creek reservoir is located in the middle section and is wholly within the boundary of Arizona. The site is at the mouth of Diamond Creek and is only 16 m. from Beach Spring, a station on the Santa Fe railroad. It is solely a power project with a limited storage capacity. The dam which creats the reservoir is of the gravity type to be constructed across the river. The walls and foundation are of granite. For a dam of 290 feet in height, the back water will be about 25 m. up the river. The power house will be placed right below the dam perpendicular to the axis of the river. It is entirely a concrete structure. The power installation would consist of eighteen 37 500 H. P. vertical, variable head turbines, directly connected to 28 000 kwa. 110 000 v. 3 phase, 60 cycle generators with necessary <b>switching</b> and auxiliary <b>apparatus.</b> Each unit is to be fed by a separate penstock wholly embedded into the masonry. Concerning the power market, the main electric transmission lines would extend to Prescott, Phoenix, Mesa, Florence etc. The mining regions of the mountains of Arizona would be the most adequate market. The demand of power in the above named places might not be large at present. It will, from the observation of the writer, rapidly increase with the wonderful advancement of all kinds of industrial development. All these things being comparatively feasible, there is one difficult problem: that is the silt. At the Diamond Creek dam site the average annual silt discharge is about 82 650 acre feet. The geographical conditions, however, will not permit silt deposites right in the reservoir. So this design will be made under the assumption given in Section 4. The silt condition and the change of lower course of the Colorado are much like those of the Yellow River in China. But one thing is different. On the Colorado most of the canyon walls are of granite, while those on the Yellow are of alluvial loess: so it is very hard, if not impossible, to get a favorable dam site on the lower part. As a visitor to this country, I should like to see the full development of the Colorado: but how about THE YELLOW!...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: There is {{a variety}} of medical and non-medical therapies in practice, which were not {{evaluated}} regarding its effectiveness by any systematic evidence oriented investigation. A number of therapies of medical and non-medical type try to treat {{the different types of}} tinnitus. The evidence in the scientific literature also had to be cleared in the field of diagnosis and classification as well as medical/psychiatric/psychological procedures of existing medical therapy. Question: The HTA report had to investigate the following questions: * Which evidence do diagnostic methods in recognition of tinnitus have? * Which types of therapy show medical effectiveness at the acute or chronic tinnitus without an organic cause? * Which consequences (need for further research, future procedures) can be drawn? Methodology: In the following databases "tinnitus" was searched according to the search string:HTA 97; INAHTA; CDAR 94; CDSR 93; CCTR 93; ME 66; ME 0 A; HT 83; SM 78; CA 66; CB 85; BA 70; BA 93; EM 74; IS 74; ET 80; EB 94; IA 70; AZ 72; CV 72; GE 79; EU 93; HN 69; ED 93; EA 08 Result: 1932 studies, unsorted after assessment in accordance with EBM criterions, selection: 409 studies. Due to the completely heterogeneous representation modes of the therapeutic approaches at the treatment of the chronic tinnitus no quantitative synthesis method could be performed. Therefore the methodology of a qualitative overview has been carried out. Results: The diagnostic confirmation of the non-specific tinnitus without organic cause meets with the problem of the assurance of the diagnosis tinnitus. According to the current opinion the stepwise diagnostics is carried out also {{in the case of the}} so called subjective tinnitus. Nothing can be said about the evidence of these procedures since no publication was found about that. A study concerning the evidence of the diagnostic questionnaires from Goebel and Hiller [1] comes to the end that the tinnitus questionnaire frequently used (TF) [2] is the best evaluated procedure. The number of therapies which treat tinnitus is exceptionally high and makes clear, that the search for "the" tinnitus therapy is still going on. According to the current knowledge tinnitus genesis is multifactorial and therefore there can’t be any standard therapy for tinnitus. The following seven categories can be distinguished: Ad 1 : Machine-aided acoustic therapies: From many studies regarding machine-aided acoustic therapy of tinnitus only two showed an evidence degree that allows scientifically correct statements about the effectiveness of these procedures. Selectively significant improvements could be shown in the comparison with a placebo (<b>apparatus</b> <b>switched</b> off) a superiority of tinnitus-maskers. Ad 2 : Electrostimulation: In an application study of electro-stimulation the results were not evaluated statistically, but it was described descriptively that a successful medical treatment can be expected in about 50 % of the cases. Ad 3 : Psychological therapy procedures: Hypnosis did not show positive effectiveness. With regard to biofeedback it can be concluded that this method can be effective in individual cases, however regarded as unreliable from missing reproducibility. Neurobiofeedback could prove that it had a positive therapeutic effect. From eight controlled studies to relaxation techniques and cognitive behaviour therapy four studies showed a therapeutic effectiveness and four failed. Combined therapies proved generally to be more effective than individual types. The behaviour medical psychotherapy could show a positive therapy effect. In a study with cognitive therapy and relaxation (three groups, a passive relaxation, an active relaxation and a cognitive therapy) short-term successes could be stated (for one month), however, the parameters of success returned on the initial value after four months. Also only coincidental and short-term successes could be achieved with cognitive behaviour therapy training, autogenic training and structured group psychotherapy. Ad 4 : Tinnitus Retraining Therapy (TRT) : Unfortunately, the published results of the TRT are methodically frequently bad and scientific of a poor value. Many of the studies presented until now regarding tinnitus retraining therapy are not informative in their scientific context. In a study with 95 patients with a chronic tinnitus TRT could show a significant, more than six months lasting stable success by comparison to a combination of TET with group behaviour therapy (improvement be achieved around at least ten points in the tinnitus questionnaire (TF)). Ad 5 : Pharmacological therapies: Rheological drugs (medicines for hemodilution) could not show any statistically significant effect in the treatment of tinnitus. Studies to the medical treatment with tocainides (lidocaine) showed repeatable positive effects on tinnitus in higher dosages (as of 1. 2 mg/day). Lamotrigine as a medicine had an effect positively only at with a small fraction of patients. Two studies with GABA receptor agonists could not prove therapeutic effects for tinnitus. Undesired side-effects were observed. Injections with Carvoverine (a glutamate antagonist) achieved significantly successes with a special form of tinnitus, the “Cochlear-synaptic tinnitus (CST) ". A tricyclic antidepressant (Amitriptilin) could prove superiority against placebo. This effect could be confirmed in another study. However Clonazepame (a benzodiazepine), could not achieve any improvement. Short-term improvements were achieved with other benzodiazepines (Clonazepame, Diazepam, Flurazepame, Oxacepame and Alprazolame). A German retrospective study suggests a graded pharmacological therapy by means of rheological infusion therapy, applications of neurotransmitters, and injections of lidocaine. This method achieved a disappearance or a recovery of the complaints at 95. 3 % of the acute and 26. 7 % of the chronic cases. Ad 6 : Surgical procedures: The effects of the operative excision of the stapes (stapedectomy) showed significant effects concerning tinnitus. This method is a routine operation to recover hearing, effects on tinnitus were observed only coincidently. There are generally high frequencies of improvements of tinnitus after cochlea implantations; however the risk of deterioration is present with this method. Ad 7 : Other and alternative therapy procedures: The hyperbaric oxygen therapy can be considered successful after acute events with tinnitus. The therapy should be started in the first month after appearance of the tinnitus. The methods transcranial-, electromagnetic and transcutaneous nerve stimulations did not show any significant effects on tinnitus. Also low laser medical treatment showed disappointing effects. The “pneumatic external contra-pulsation” is described as an unproblematic usable procedure by the authors of the examination, but 10 % of the patients had to stop the medical treatment because of complications associated with the medical treatment. Acupuncture showed significant improvements in comparison to medical treatment. The effectiveness of this therapy could not be reproduced in another study. Five other studies between 1993 and 1999 also did not show any therapeutic effect of this method. Gingko-Biloba preparations did not show any positive effects in large-scale studies on tinnitus. Discussion: Neither the diagnostic procedures nor the therapeutic methods or the individual therapies reach a usual scientific level in medicine. Unsolved problems concerning insurance, economic as well as legal problems have resulted for the patients and for caring stuff from this unsatisfactory situation. Numerous competitive tinnitus emergence models led to an incredible creativity in trying out different therapy approaches. No convergence of the therapy procedures can be seen within the last decades of tinnitus research, contrariwise there is always more and more “creativity” of new approaches. Priority has to be given to find the cause of tinnitus since therapies are a consequence of a better understanding of these symptoms that evidence oriented investigations on an usual scientific level can be started. Conclusion: The innumerable therapeutic approaches, seeming completely incoherent to their effects should be coordinated on the meaningfulness, on the success parameters and with patient safety in light of the most plausible explanation models for non-specific chronic Tinnitus. To this the facilities of competence centres or related science- directing facilities are recommendable. Examinations which are carried out also with small numbers show often methodical insufficiencies. It is necessary that minimal requirements on a scientifically clinical experiment, such as design, case number calculation, analytic statistics, control group, are fulfilled. It is recommendable, that further research has to be promoted regarding tinnitus causes that a coordinated evidence-orientated treatment will be developed...|$|R
