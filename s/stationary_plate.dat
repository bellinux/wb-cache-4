To solve the definition problem of the interface between a rotating disk and a <b>stationary</b> <b>plate</b> in the computational simulation, a tiny gap is set between the rotating disk and the <b>stationary</b> <b>plate.</b> The {{results show that the}} rotating disk suspended above the surface adds more complexity to the flow field of jet impingement on a <b>stationary</b> <b>plate.</b> The swirling flow around the rotating disk obstructs the impinging jet flow to penetrate into the interfacial contact zone and forces the wall jet across the rotating disk to flow along transverse directions. For the given jet impinging velocity and nozzle orientation, as the disk rotational speed increases, the effect of the rotating disk on the impinging jet flow behaves more significantly. The impinging jet with small inject velocity is difficult to penetrate through the interfacial contact zone to follow by the disk swirl flows.

We carry out an asymptotic analysis of this problem {{in the limit of}} small gap angle and large surface tension. We assume that the Deborah number, the Reynolds number and the retardation parameter are all order unity and that the shape of the free surface is very nearly spherical.

Substrate movement influences fouling communities and so understanding of how species assemblages are related to specific substrate conditions is crucial as a management tool. Here we describe the species assemblage of the community after six months of development on granite plates in Paranaguá Bay. Species richness was similar in the two treatments, with 12 species on floating (constant depth) plates and 15 on stationary (variable depth) plates. However, species composition differed, with the community on floating plates being dominated by the native bivalve Mytella charruana (66. 1 ± 5. 5 % cover) and that on stationary plates dominated by the barnacles Fistulobalanus citerosum (49. 8 ± 3. 5 % cover) and the introduced Amphibalanus reticulatus (33. 9 ± 3. 7 % cover). Other introduced species were Garveia franciscana, on one <b>stationary</b> <b>plate,</b> and Megabalanus coccopoma also on one <b>stationary</b> <b>plate</b> and not very abundant on half of the floating plates (< 2 %). Thus, stationary plates were more susceptible to introduced species that may become very abundant, suggesting that this type of substrate should be a priority in management for bioinvasion control.
