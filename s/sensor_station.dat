40|$|As the {{importance}} of GNSS to civilian infrastructure increases, the ability to detect and localise sources of interference that disrupts its operation becomes increasingly important. In order to calculate the time-delay measurements in a Time Difference Of Arrival (TDOA) based localisation system for localising interference to GPS within the GNSS Environmental Monitoring System (GEMS), data collected at different <b>sensor</b> <b>stations</b> need to be cross-correlated together. However, along with the interference signals, the collected sets of data contain the GPS signals themselves, which create undesired correlation peaks. These correlation peaks could be mistaken for weak interferers during the TDOA processing. This work investigates and reports on the behaviour of these correlation peaks and the impact they have on using TDOA techniques for localising interference. If the <b>sensor</b> <b>stations</b> are close together, the time-delays of the satellites will be close together. This causes a large cross-correlation peak near the zero delay point as the satellite signals arrive at the <b>sensor</b> <b>stations</b> at a similar time. As distance between the stations increases the cross-correlation peaks spread out, {{but there will be}} situations where the time-delays for individual satellites will overlap, again causing a larger central cross-correlation peak. This results in an increase of the interferer effective Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) required for its cross-correlation peak to be above the GPS crosscorrelation peaks which affects the detection and estimation threshold.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{feasibility}} of a batteryless wireless sensor supplied with energy by using microwave power transmission (MPT). If we perform co-channel operation of MPT and wireless local area networks (WLANs) {{for the sake of}} spectral efficiency, a time division method for MPT and WLAN communications is required to avoid serious interference from MPT to WLAN data transmissions. In addition, to reduce the power consumption of a sensor, the use of power-save operation of the sensor is desirable. We proposed a scheduling scheme that allocates time for MPT and WLAN communications. Specifically, in the proposed scheduling system, an energy source transmits microwave power to a <b>sensor</b> <b>station</b> except when the <b>sensor</b> <b>station</b> transmits data frames or receives beacon frames. In addition, in the proposed scheduling system, we force the remaining energy of the <b>sensor</b> <b>station</b> to converge to a maximum value by adjusting the time interval of data transmission from the <b>sensor</b> <b>station</b> such that the power consumption of the <b>sensor</b> <b>station</b> is reduced.

40|$|Nowadays, {{many people}} and {{organizations}} depend on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS. Monitoring of GNSS is important {{to ensure the quality}} of GNSS measurements and products. The availability of the signals-in-space (SiS) {{is an essential part of}} the monitoring of GNSS, but it is not clear how availability is defined and standards for monitoring are lacking. The main research question for this thesis is therefore: Which are the key performance indicators related to availability that unambiguously describe <b>sensor</b> <b>station</b> and system performance in time, how can these be computed in an operational manner, and how can they be presented in a condensed form to the stakeholders? This includes an objective of defining unambiguous performance parameters for <b>sensor</b> <b>station</b> and system, and address the considerations related to the definition. A prototype software tool is created to study the algorithms and compute the key performance indicators. Availability is in the basis a binary operation: a signal is available or unavailable. When this is applied on daily measurements, daily statistics can be computed. A signal is considered available if the code, carrier phase and C/N 0 measurements are present, and meet certain standards. A signal is said to be expected if the satellite is expected to transmit that signal, the receiver is configured to receive that signal, and the signal is not blocked by objects in the signal’s path to the <b>sensor</b> <b>station.</b> For this it’s needed to define and compute an elevation mask for each station. The <b>sensor</b> <b>station</b> and system performance parameters are computed from a network of sensor stations, using files in the Receiver Independent Exchange format (RINEX). Four key performance indicators are defined for the <b>sensor</b> <b>station</b> performance. The Daily Station Availability describes the part of the day that the station is operational, the Daily Station Total Availability gives how well the station receives, and the Effective Mean Elevation quantifies the elevation mask and thus the location of the <b>sensor</b> <b>station.</b> These three parameters are summarized into the Overall Station Quality parameter, which gives and overall performance class to the <b>sensor</b> <b>station.</b> For the system performance a satellite is considered available if all signals are received by a sensor station of the monitoring network and the health status is healthy. The satellite is considered unavailable if the signals are received by none of the monitoring stations, while expected by at least two stations, or the health status is unhealthy. The Daily GNSS Availability parameter gives the percentage of the day that the satellite was available and the Daily Available number of Satellites tells how many satellites were available during the day.   The parameters are computed for a period of 100 days. Results are presented using color codes and by showing only detailed information in case of anomalies or specific investigations. The proposed key performance indicators showed to be very useful at pointing out good performances or anomalies. While SiS availability gives much insight in the performance, a monitoring tool can be improved when combined with other performance aspects.  </p...|$|E

40|$|Increases in {{greenhouse}} sizes {{have forced}} the growers to increase measurement points for tracking changes in the environment, thus enabling energy saving and more accurate adjustments. However, increases in measurement points mean increases in installation and maintenance cost. Not to mention, once the measurement points have been built and installed, they can be tedious to relocate in the future. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} Masters thesis is to present a novel project called “Automated Wireless Greenhouse Climate Management System” which is capable of intelligently monitoring and controlling the greenhouse climate conditions in a preprogrammed manner. The proposed system consists of three stations: <b>Sensor</b> <b>Station,</b> Coordinator Station, and Central Station. To allow for better monitoring of the climate condition in the greenhouse, the <b>sensor</b> <b>station</b> is equipped with several sensor elements such as CO 2, Temperature, humidity, light, soil moisture and soil temperature. The communication between the <b>sensor</b> <b>station</b> and the coordinator station is achieved via ZigBee wireless modules and the communication between coordinator station and the central station is achieved via long range RF modems. An important aspect of designing a wireless network is the reliability of data transmission. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the developed system will not lose packets during transmission. An experiment was carried out in one of the greenhouses at Plant and Food Research Ltd, New Zealand {{in order to determine the}} functionality and reliability of the designed wireless sensor network using ZigBee wireless technology.

40|$|Abstract: Recent {{developments}} in sensor technology allows for capturing dynamic patterns in vehicle movements, tem-perature changes, and sea-level fluctuations, {{just to name}} a few. A usual way for decision making on sensor networks, such as detecting exceptional surface level changes across the Pacific ocean, involves collecting measurement data from all sensors to build a predictor in a central processing station. However, data col-lection becomes challenging when communication bandwidth is limited, due to communication distance or low-energy requirements. Also, such settings will introduce unfavorable latency for making predictions on unseen events. In this paper, we propose an alternative strategy for such scenarios, aiming to build a consensus support vector machine (SVM) in each <b>sensor</b> <b>station</b> by exchanging a small amount of sampled information from local kernel matrices amongst peers. Our method is based on decomposing a “global ” kernel defined with all features into “local ” kernels defined only with attributes stored in each <b>sensor</b> <b>station,</b> sampling few entries of the decomposed kernel matrices that belong to other stations, and filling in unsampled entries in kernel matrices by matrix completion. Experiments on benchmark data sets illustrate that a consensus SVM can be built in each station using limited communication, which is competent in prediction performance to an SVM built with accessing all features. ...|$|E

On GIOVE-B, it will be shown that the GIOVE estimation noise limits the actual characterization of the PHM stability. Over the medium term (12 ~ 24 hours), the performance of the on-board clock is affected by oscillations at the orbital period whose possible causes will be discussed. Over the long term (> 1 day), the PHM exhibits excellent frequency drift performances (below 1 × 10 - 15 /day). On GIOVE-A, it will be shown that the short-term stability of RAFS is not limited by the estimation noise and is below the specified limits (5 × 10 - 12 /SQRT(tau)).
