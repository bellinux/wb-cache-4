5|$|It {{is often}} claimed {{that at the}} time, the pass of Thermopylae {{consisted}} of a track along {{the shore of the}} Malian Gulf <b>so</b> <b>narrow</b> that only one chariot could pass through at a time. In fact, as noted below, the pass was 100 metres wide, probably wider than the Greeks could have held against the Persian hordes. Herodotus reports that the Phocians had improved the defenses of the pass by channelling the stream from the hot springs to create a marsh, and it was a causeway across this marsh which was only wide enough for a single chariot to traverse. In a later passage, describing a Gaulish attempt to force the pass, Herodotus describes how the Gauls who fell into the marsh disappeared and were drowned.|$|E
5|$|Sperm {{whales are}} not the easiest of whales to watch, due to their long dive times and ability to travel long {{distances}} underwater. However, due to the distinctive look and large size of the whale, watching is increasingly popular. Sperm whale watchers often use hydrophones {{to listen to the}} clicks of the whales and locate them before they surface. Popular locations for sperm whale watching include the town of Kaikoura on New Zealand's South Island, Andenes and Tromsø in Arctic Norway; as well as the Azores, where the continental shelf is <b>so</b> <b>narrow</b> that whales can be observed from the shore, and Dominica where a long-term scientific research program, The Dominica Sperm Whale Project, has been in operation since 2005.|$|E
25|$|In 1188 Saladin {{conquered the}} area, reconverting the {{enclosure}} to a mosque but allowing Christians to continue worshipping there. Saladin also added a minaret at each corner—two of which still survive—and the minbar. Samuel ben Samson visited the cave in 1210; {{he says that}} the visitor must descend by twenty-four steps in a passageway <b>so</b> <b>narrow</b> that the rock touches him on either hand.|$|E

25|$|The initial {{bridge in}} this {{location}} was built of timber and opened in January 1875. Rather narrow, it also {{soon began to}} be attacked by shipworms, and in 1910, more than 30 of the piles had been replaced, {{as well as the}} decking. The bridge was also single-lane, and <b>so</b> <b>narrow,</b> even pedestrians could barely pass a vehicle safely. The bridge was eventually considered structurally unsound and closed in 1914, before being fully demolished.|$|E
25|$|Despite its name, {{the station}} is not located on Lexington Avenue and 59th Street. It is {{actually}} located on Lexington and 60th Street. Originally, the Broadway subway was to run to Queens over the Queensboro Bridge. Because the side streets are <b>so</b> <b>narrow,</b> the Queens-bound track was to run under 59th Street and the return track under 60th Street. There are exits however to Lexington Avenue and 59th Streets via the local IRT platforms.|$|E
25|$|The {{stretch of}} road {{descending}} into Peekskill Hollow was very problematic. Roosevelt feared that route would take the parkway too far east. It offered a view into the valley as it descended, but to preserve existing rock outcrops {{it was necessary to}} route it so that it descended at an 8.5% grade and make the roadway <b>so</b> <b>narrow</b> that there was only a foot (30.5cm) between the curb and the wall on either side.|$|E

25|$|Although worn {{for decades}} by exotic dancers, in the 1980s the G-string first gained {{popularity}} in South America, particularly in Brazil. Originally {{a style of}} swimsuit, {{the back of the}} garment is <b>so</b> <b>narrow</b> that it disappears between the buttocks. By the 1990s the design had made its way to most of the Western world, and thong underwear became popular. Today, the thong is one of the fastest-selling styles of underwear among women, and is also worn by men.|$|E
25|$|Morse code {{is usually}} heard at the {{receiver}} as a medium-pitched on/off audio tone (600–1000Hz), so transmissions {{are easier to}} copy than voice through the noise on congested frequencies, {{and it can be}} used in very high noise / low signal environments. The transmitted power is concentrated into a limited bandwidth <b>so</b> <b>narrow</b> receiver filters can be used to suppress interference from adjacent frequencies. The audio tone is usually created by use of a beat frequency oscillator.|$|E
25|$|A {{quantum well}} laser is {{a laser diode}} in which the active region of the device is <b>so</b> <b>narrow</b> that quantum {{confinement}} occurs. The wavelength of the light emitted by a quantum well laser {{is determined by the}} width of the active region rather than just the bandgap of the material from which it is constructed. The quantum well laser was invented by Charles H. Henry, a physicist at Bell Labs, in 1974 and was granted a patent for it in 1976.|$|E

25|$|The {{entrance}} to the active site for this enzyme is made up mainly of several arginine, histidine, serine, and aspartate side-chains, with a glutamate side-chain playing a secondary role. These side-chains, to be specific Arg359, Arg528, His469, and Ser386, are conserved within each transketolase enzyme and interact with the phosphate group of the donor and acceptor substrates. Because the substrate channel is <b>so</b> <b>narrow,</b> the donor and acceptor substrates cannot be bound simultaneously. Also, the substrates conform into a slightly extended form upon binding in the active site to accommodate this narrow channel.|$|E
25|$|A {{comparison}} of the South American Inca civilization to Mesoamerican civilizations shows the same lack of wheeled vehicles. Although the Incas used a vast network of paved roads, these roads are so rough, steep, and narrow that {{they appear to be}} unsuitable for wheeled use. Bridges that the Inca people built, and even continue to use and maintain today in some remote areas, are straw-rope bridges <b>so</b> <b>narrow</b> (about 2–3 feet wide) that no wheeled vehicle can fit. Inca roads were used mainly by chaski message runners and llama caravans.|$|E
25|$|Prodi's {{government}} faced {{a crisis}} over policies in early 2007, after just {{nine months of}} government. Three ministers in Prodi's Cabinet boycotted a vote in January to continue funding for Italian troop deployments in Afghanistan. Lawmakers approved {{the expansion of the}} US military base Caserma Ederle at the end of January, but the victory was <b>so</b> <b>narrow</b> that Deputy Prime Minister Francesco Rutelli criticised members of the coalition who had not supported the government. At around the same time, Justice Minister Clemente Mastella, of the coalition member UDEUR Populars, said he would rather see the government fall than support its unwed couples legislation.|$|E

25|$|Job was quiet, brief in words, and {{the only}} sound heard from his lips was the Jesus prayer. For many days and weeks he would retreat into his locked cave, <b>so</b> <b>narrow</b> that entry is difficult, and so small that it was {{impossible}} to sit, stand or lie conveniently. From the long periods of kneeling, his knees were covered with wounds, and wearing knee-marks into the rock floor. His disciple Dosyfey recounts that he saw supernatural light coming from the depths of the cave, shining for two hours onto the opposite side of the church. Dosyfey records that at the sight was terrified and fell to the ground.|$|E
25|$|They {{continued}} down river, hitting more rapids and cutting wood from {{trees along the}} bank for fuel. Captain Miller sent two men ahead in a boat to scout out for rocks and rapids, and the Shoshone proceeded behind them. They ran a particularly hazardous stretch at the Mountain Sheep section in Seven Devils Canyon. The boat was sucked into a whirlpool, and a huge wall of water came aboard, breaking into and nearly flooding the engine room, washing big chunks of cordwood all about the engine room floor. As {{the men in the}} engine room dodged these hazards, the Shoshone ran through a passage <b>so</b> <b>narrow</b> that {{there were only a few}} inches clearance between the rock walls on both sides of the vessel.|$|E
25|$|Beijing {{is famous}} for its siheyuans, a type of {{residence}} where a common courtyard is shared by the surrounding buildings. Among the more grand examples are the Prince Gong Mansion and Residence of Soong Ching-ling. These courtyards are usually connected by alleys called hutongs. The hutongs are generally straight and run east to west so that doorways face north and south for good Feng Shui. They vary in width; some are <b>so</b> <b>narrow</b> only a few pedestrians can pass through at a time. Once ubiquitous in Beijing, siheyuans and hutongs are rapidly disappearing, as entire city blocks of hutongs are replaced by high-rise buildings. Residents of the hutongs are entitled to live in the new buildings in apartments of at least the same size as their former residences. Many complain, however, that the traditional sense of community and street life of the hutongs cannot be replaced, and these properties are often government owned.|$|E
30|$|This paper proves (a) strong {{convergence}} {{of the stress}} even without any smoothness assumption for a class of stabilised degenerate convex minimisation problems. Given the limitted a priori error control in those cases, the sharp a posteriori error control is of even higher relevance. This paper derives (b) guaranteed a posteriori error control via some equilibration technique which does not rely on the strict Galerkin orthogonality of the unperturbed problem. In the presence of L 2 control in the original minimisation problem, some realistic model scenario with piecewise smooth exact solution allows for {{strong convergence}} of the gradients plus refined a posteriori error estimates. This paper presents (c) an improved a posteriori error control in this interface problem and <b>so</b> <b>narrows</b> the efficiency reliability gap.|$|R

500|$|Thus, {{when the}} action began {{and became a}} {{defensive}} rather than an offensive battle for the Russians, their heavy preponderance in artillery was wasted on a right wing that would never be attacked, while the French artillery did much to help win the battle. Toll and others would make attempts to cover up their mistakes in this deployment and later attempts by historians would compound the issue. Indeed, Clausewitz too complained about Toll's dispositions being <b>so</b> <b>narrow</b> and deep that needless losses were incurred from artillery fire. The Russian position therefore was just about [...] long with about 80,000 of the 1st Army {{on the right and}} 34,000 of the 2nd Army on the left.|$|E
500|$|South of Chambers Street, {{there were}} to be two {{branches}} constructed. The first of the two would run to the Battery via Greenwich Street, while the second branch would turn eastward under Park Place and Beekman Street and down William Street and Old Slip. After going through Lower Manhattan, the second branch would go through a tunnel under the East River before running under Clark and Fulton Streets until a junction at Borough Hall with the existing Contract 2 IRT Brooklyn Line. In order to pass under the Broadway and Park Row subway lines, this branch has grades as steep as 3%, being located [...] below surface level. As a result, the Park Place station was built with escalators. Because William Street is <b>so</b> <b>narrow</b> ( [...] wide), every building along the line had to be underpinned. The entire line, consisting of eight sections, was expected to cost $14,793,419.|$|E
40|$|I’ve been pondering {{this problem}} as I {{participated in this}} {{sparking}} conference titled “Beyond the Law”: What, if anything, is “beyond the law”? The better parent’s risk aversion, the propertyless man’s hunger: should we insist that these are non-legal attributes about these characters which interact with legal rules to condition legally important decisions? Are they inside or outside of the law? We can think of it either way. Most of the time, to be sure, I’m engaged in descriptive projects that are basically attempts to extend the reach of law. Not that I {{want it to be}} big, I’m trying to understand how big it is. But in the rest of my remarks I’d like to spool out my ambivalence about this. Why does it feel more critical, more decisive, to insist on the coercive character of background rules, no matter how far in the background they lurk? And why does the resulting picture of the world seem <b>so</b> <b>narrowed,</b> <b>so</b> reduced, once we have succeeded in drawing it? What’s at stake in positing that law is everywhere – or that there is something beyond it...|$|R
