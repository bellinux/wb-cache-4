5|$|Implementing {{the diet}} can present {{difficulties}} for caregivers {{and the patient}} due to the time commitment involved in measuring and planning meals. Since any unplanned eating can potentially break the nutritional balance required, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>find</b> the discipline needed to maintain the diet challenging and unpleasant. Some people terminate the diet or switch to a less demanding diet, like the modified Atkins diet (MAD) or the low-glycaemic index treatment (LGIT) diet, because they find the difficulties too great.|$|E

25|$|Domesticated Muscovy ducks, {{like those}} pictured, often have plumage {{features}} differing from other wild birds. White breeds are preferred for meat production, as darker ones can have much melanin in the skin, which <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>find</b> unappealing.|$|E
25|$|Aside from {{religious}} reasons (discussed below), <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>find</b> they prefer cremation over traditional burial for personal reasons. The {{thought of a}} long and slow decomposition process is unappealing to some; many people find that they prefer cremation because it disposes of the body instantly.|$|E
25|$|DMOZ's editor removal {{procedures}} are overseen by DMOZ's staff and meta editors. According to DMOZ's official editorial guidelines, editors are removed for abusive editing practices or uncivil behaviour. Discussions {{that may result}} in disciplinary action against volunteer editors {{take place in a}} private forum which can only be accessed by DMOZ's staff and meta editors. Volunteer editors who are being discussed are not given notice that such proceedings are taking place. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>find</b> this arrangement distasteful, wanting instead a discussion modelled more like a trial held in the U.S. judicial system.|$|E

25|$|The {{spectrum}} of light emitted from a fluorescent lamp {{is the combination}} of light directly emitted by the mercury vapor, and light emitted by the phosphorescent coating. The spectral lines from the mercury emission and the phosphorescence effect give a combined spectral distribution of light {{that is different from}} those produced by incandescent sources. The relative intensity of light emitted in each narrow band of wavelengths over the visible spectrum is in different proportions compared to that of an incandescent source. Colored objects are perceived differently under light sources with differing spectral distributions. For example, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>find</b> the color rendition produced by some fluorescent lamps to be harsh and displeasing. A healthy person can sometimes appear to have an unhealthy skin tone under fluorescent lighting. The extent to which this phenomenon occurs is related to the light's spectral composition, and may be gauged by its color rendering index (CRI).|$|E
25|$|Disadvantages of low {{pressure}} sodium lighting are that fixtures must usually {{be larger than}} competing fixtures, and that color cannot be distinguished, due to its emitting principally a single wavelength of light (see security lighting). Due to the substantial size of the lamp, particularly in higher wattages such as 135 W and 180 W, control of light emissions from {{low pressure}} sodium luminaires is more difficult. For applications requiring more precise direction of light (such as narrow roadways) the native lamp efficacy advantage of this lamp type is decreased and may be entirely lost compared to high pressure sodium lamps. Allegations that this also leads to higher amounts of light pollution from luminaires running these lamps arise principally because of older luminaires with poor shielding, still widely in use in the UK and in some other locations. Modern low-pressure sodium fixtures with better optics and full shielding, and the decreased skyglow impacts of yellow light preserve the luminous efficacy advantage of low-pressure sodium and result in most cases is less energy consumption and less visible light pollution. Unfortunately, due to continued lack of accurate information, many lighting professionals continue to disparage low-pressure sodium, contributing to its decreased acceptance and specification in lighting standards and therefore its use. Another disadvantage of low-pressure sodium lamps is that <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>find</b> the characteristic yellow light very displeasing aesthetically.|$|E

"Many gardeners {{will agree}} that hand-weeding {{is not the}} terrible {{drudgery}} that it is often made out to be. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>find</b> in it a kind of soothing monotony.

2500|$|<b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>find</b> good vision {{correction}} {{and comfort}} with a [...] "piggyback" [...] lens combination, in which RGP lenses are worn over soft lenses, both providing {{a degree of}} vision correction. One form of piggyback lens makes use of a soft lens with a countersunk central area to accept the rigid lens.

50|$|Fruits {{comes in}} {{clusters}} and the flesh has {{a fair amount}} of natural sugar and a lime flavor. However it still lacks the intensity of acid found in more common citrus fruits, so <b>some</b> <b>people</b> might <b>find</b> it insipid. Fruit shape is globose, about eight cm. in diameter. The tree has lots of long and strong thorns, as implicated from the botanical name, longi-spina.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of these improvements, long waiting times reduced, and the private {{healthcare}} sector now sells its surplus capacity to the NHS. Dentistry is an area where many practitioners prefer to work privately (because they can set their own fees). NHS dentistry can then be patchy, and <b>some</b> <b>people</b> may <b>find</b> that private dentistry is the only practical option open to them in their locality.|$|R
2500|$|Otto Weininger ( [...] ; 3 April 1880 – 4 October 1903) was an Austrian philosopher. In 1903, he {{published}} the book Geschlecht und Charakter (Sex and Character), which gained popularity after his suicide {{at the age}} of 23. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>find</b> Weininger's ideas to be misogynistic and antisemitic, while others find them to be extremely perceptive and realistic. [...] Parts of his rhetoric were used by the Nazi regime (while at the same time denouncing him) - though this arguably cannot be held against him. [...] Despite all criticisms Weininger was held to be a great genius by the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein and the writer August Strindberg (see discussion below).|$|E
2500|$|Roman Polanski {{gave away}} {{all of his}} {{possessions}} after the murders, unable to bear any reminders of the period that he called [...] "the happiest I ever was in my life". He remained in Los Angeles until the killers were arrested. After, he fled to Europe to evade criminal charges of raping a 13-year-old girl. His 1979 film Tess was dedicated [...] "to Sharon", as Tate had read Thomas Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbervilles during her final stay with Polanski in London and had left it for him to read with the comment {{that it would be}} a good story for them to film together. He tried to explain his anguish after the murder of his wife and unborn son in his 1984 autobiography Roman by Polanski, saying [...] "Since Sharon's death, and despite appearances to the contrary, my enjoyment of life has been incomplete. In moments of unbearable personal tragedy <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>find</b> solace in religion. In my case the opposite happened. Any religious faith I had was shattered by Sharon's murder. It reinforced my faith in the absurd." ...|$|E
2500|$|Because Surrealist writers seldom, if ever, {{appear to}} {{organize}} {{their thoughts and}} the images they present, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>find</b> much of their work difficult to parse. This notion however is a superficial comprehension, prompted no doubt by Breton's initial emphasis on automatic writing as the main route toward a higher reality. But—as in Breton's case—much of what is presented as purely automatic is actually edited and very [...] "thought out". Breton himself later admitted that automatic writing's centrality had been overstated, and other elements were introduced, especially as the growing involvement of visual artists in the movement forced the issue, since automatic painting required a rather more strenuous set of approaches. Thus such elements as collage were introduced, arising partly from an ideal of startling juxtapositions as revealed in Pierre Reverdy's poetry. And—as in Magritte's case (where there is no obvious recourse to either automatic techniques or collage)—the very notion of convulsive joining became a tool for revelation in and of itself. Surrealism {{was meant to be}} always in flux—to be more modern than modern—and so it was natural there should be a rapid shuffling of the philosophy as new challenges arose.|$|E
