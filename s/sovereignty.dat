5|$|On 21 December 1979, Malaysia {{published}} a map {{that showed the}} island to be within its territorial waters. This ignited a 29-year territorial dispute which, together {{with the issue of}} <b>sovereignty</b> over the nearby maritime features of Middle Rocks and South Ledge, the disputants presented to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for resolution. On 23 May 2008 the ICJ ruled that Pedra Branca was under Singapore's <b>sovereignty.</b> Although the island had originally been under the <b>sovereignty</b> of the Johor Sultanate, the United Kingdom and Singapore had carried out various acts of <b>sovereignty</b> in respect of the island. The failure of Malaysia and its predecessors to respond to these acts, and other actions that demonstrated their acknowledgment of Singapore's <b>sovereignty</b> over the island, meant that Singapore had gained <b>sovereignty</b> over Pedra Branca. On the other hand, Middle Rocks remains part of Malaysian territory as Singapore had not manifested any acts of <b>sovereignty</b> in respect of it. The Court did not rule definitively on the remaining outcrop, South Ledge, merely declaring that it belonged to the state in the territorial waters of which it is located. Malaysia and Singapore have established what they have named the Joint Technical Committee to delimit the maritime boundary in the area around Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks, and to determine the ownership of South Ledge.|$|E
5|$|Relations with Singapore took a dive {{after the}} International Court of Justice ruled in Singapore's favour {{following}} a long legal {{battle over the}} <b>sovereignty</b> of Pedra Branca. At the inaugural session of the 12th Johor State Assembly in 2008, the Sultan stated his stand on Malaysia's <b>sovereignty</b> over Pedra Branca, and vowed to find legal means to retrieve the island's <b>sovereignty.</b>|$|E
5|$|The ICJ {{noted that}} under certain circumstances, <b>sovereignty</b> over {{territory}} may pass {{due to the}} failure of the state which has <b>sovereignty</b> to respond to the other state's conduct à titre de souverain, that is, concrete manifestations of the display of territorial <b>sovereignty</b> by the other state.|$|E

5|$|Although Captain Edward Edwards {{discovered}} the atoll in 1791, Ducie {{was not considered}} a British possession. In 1867 Ducie was claimed by the United States under the Guano Islands Act, which established that an uninhabited territory with guano deposits could be claimed as a US possession, {{so long as it}} was unclaimed by any other country. Despite claims on several other territories, based on various documents such as the Guano Islands Act, neither the United States nor the United Kingdom recognised the <b>sovereignty</b> claimed by each other. Neither of the two considered that the mere discovery of an island was sufficient to claim <b>sovereignty</b> over it, and often a formal act of possession was considered the proper procedure to claim rights over a territory. Ultimately, the United States did not assert its <b>sovereignty</b> over most of its claimed territories.|$|E
5|$|Display of British and Singapore ensigns on island. Ensigns, {{associated}} with maritime matters, are marks of nationality and not <b>sovereignty.</b> Singapore had also not demonstrated any sovereign intent in the flying of the British and Singapore ensigns from Horsburgh Lighthouse. The Pulau Pisang incident {{was not an}} acknowledgement by Malaysia of Singapore's <b>sovereignty</b> over Pedra Branca; {{it had been a}} matter of domestic political sensibility – Pulau Pisang is much larger than Pedra Branca and has a small local population.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, British prime {{minister}} Gordon Brown {{had a meeting}} with Argentine president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, and said {{that there would be no}} further talks over the <b>sovereignty</b> of the Falklands. In March 2013, the Falkland Islands held a referendum on its political status, with 99.8 percent of voters favoured remaining under British rule. Argentina does not recognise the Falkland Islands as a partner in negotiations; consequently, it dismissed the Falkland Islands' <b>sovereignty</b> referendum.|$|E
5|$|In September 1982 {{she visited}} China {{to discuss with}} Deng Xiaoping the <b>sovereignty</b> of Hong Kong after 1997. China was the first {{communist}} state Thatcher had visited {{and she was the}} first British prime minister to visit China. Throughout their meeting, she sought the PRC's agreement to a continued British presence in the territory. Deng insisted that the PRC's <b>sovereignty</b> on Hong Kong was non-negotiable, but stated his willingness to settle the <b>sovereignty</b> issue with the British government through formal negotiations, and both governments promised to maintain Hong Kong's stability and prosperity. After the two-year negotiations, Thatcher conceded to the PRC government and signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration in Beijing in 1984, agreeing to hand over Hong Kong's <b>sovereignty</b> in 1997.|$|E

40|$|The First World War and {{the decades}} of turmoil thereafter, namely the 1930 s, the Second World War and, later, the Cold War, are {{historical}} moments relevant to prove {{that one of the}} most famous ideas of International Relations is, in fact, impossible. The idea of an ontologically, yet not phenomenologically, permanent state of war is incompatible with a world filled with <b>sovereignties.</b> These <b>sovereignties</b> have never lost their political and strategic control of wars, not even in the main conflicts of the 20 thc.

40|$|To aim to inductively {{clarify the}} {{professional}} identity of occupational therapists {{who work in}} a clinical setting, the researchers interviewed the 22 occupational therapists who had a minimum of 5 years or more of practice in the field. The professional identities of the practicing occupational therapists were constructed by the following two core categories: “harmonizing with a client’s life and the characteristic of a client’s disability”, and “giving clients <b>sovereignties</b> as a mission of the occupational therapists”. The occupational therapist can carry the role of coordinator in an interdisciplinary team for the clients with disability by understanding them. This is achieved based on the core category called “giving clients <b>sovereignties</b> as a mission of the occupational therapists”. Furthermore, {{in order to achieve}} the clients’ <b>sovereignties,</b> the occupational therapist can be an operational unit by planning practical strategies and practicing them based on the core category called “harmonizing with a client’s life and the characteristic of a client’s disability”. The fact is often difficult for these clients that they are concerned with how he/she lived actively. It is through unique ways of contributing for the clients in a team of professionals that the occupational therapists try to understand the clients not as “patients” but as “human beings”, and try to harmonize with their life and the characteristics of their disability, then try to support and empower them to reach a stage in which they have the <b>sovereignties</b> of their lives. </p...|$|R
5|$|The British favoured the {{prospect}} of the Temenggong in taking over the administration of Johor from the Sultan. Sultan Ali's claims to <b>sovereignty</b> were quickly refuted by the British and the Temenggong, who was {{quick to point out that}} the Sultan's late father, Sultan Hussein had never pursued active claims to his <b>sovereignty</b> rights over Johor in spite of his recognition by the British in the 1824 Anglo-Dutch Treaty. At that time, Johor came under the effective charge of the Temenggong's late father, Abdul Rahman, as with Pahang, which was under the control of the Bendahara. Further documents revealed that if Johor were to be under the control of a monarch, de jure <b>sovereignty</b> would have been laid under the charge of the Sultan of Lingga, Sultan Mahmud Muzaffar Shah and not with Sultan Ali.|$|E
5|$|The English claimed <b>sovereignty</b> {{based on}} the false claim that Svalbard was {{discovered}} by Hugh Willoughby in 1553, that James I had annexed it in 1614 {{and that it was}} the English who had started whaling. The Netherlands stated that whaling could not be the basis for claiming <b>sovereignty.</b> The issue ended in a political deadlock, with Denmark–Norway and England both claiming <b>sovereignty</b> and France, the Netherlands and Spain claiming the archipelago a free zone under mare liberum. Although Denmark–Norway never formally gave up its claim to Svalbard, the archipelago continued to be a terra nullius—a land without a government.|$|E
5|$|The RIRA {{also has}} a {{political}} wing, the 32 County <b>Sovereignty</b> Movement (formerly the 32 County <b>Sovereignty</b> Committee), led by Francis Mackey. The RIRA is distinct from the Continuity IRA, another Provisional IRA splinter group founded in 1986, although the two groups {{have been known to}} co-operate at a local level. The Provisional IRA has been hostile to the RIRA and issued threats to RIRA members, and in October 2000 was alleged to be responsible for the fatal shooting of Belfast RIRA member Joe O'Connor according to O'Connor's family and 32 County <b>Sovereignty</b> Movement member Marian Price.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} how the Indonesian state copes {{with the emergence of}} global networks of business and civil society as new sovereigns over sustainability of an economically very important activity on its territory: the production of palm oil. Indonesia is the largest producer and exporter of palm oil in the world and plans to double its current production of Crude Palm Oil by 2020, mainly by expanding palm oil production. Global networks of business and civil society fear that this will lead to further loss of forest, biodiversity and peat soils, and herewith increase of greenhouse gas emissions. Local NGOs and smallholder movements expect that expansion of palm oil production will fuel new land conflicts between communities and plantation companies. To map the plural legal order that has evolved as a result of non-state actors claiming political legitimacy to define sustainability of palm oil production in Indonesia, three types of <b>sovereignties</b> are distinguished (based on Comaroff and Comaroff 2009) : <b>sovereignties</b> over territory and its inhabitants, <b>sovereignties</b> over transactional spheres and commodity flows, and <b>sovereignties</b> over people conjoined in faith or culture. To describe the dilemma’s and strategies of the Indonesian state in political decision-making over sustainability in a plural legal order, the concepts of the cunning state (Randeria 2003) and the ecological state (Eckersley 2004) are used, examined and adapted. Our analysis suggests that Indonesian state actors both challenge and reproduce the global sustainability regime framed and dominated by European non-state actors. They do so by competing and cooperating with global private-civil networks and by establishing agreements with other states and intergovernmental agencies...|$|R

5|$|The United States also observes tribal <b>sovereignty</b> of the American Indian {{nations to}} a limited degree, as it does with the states' <b>sovereignty.</b> American Indians are U.S. {{citizens}} and tribal lands {{are subject to the}} jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress and the federal courts.

5|$|The primary {{issue of}} {{debate within the}} <b>sovereignty</b> {{movement}} became on what terms <b>sovereignty</b> would be put before the electorate. Parizeau, long identified with the independantiste wing of the party, was opposed to the PQ's general historical preference for an economic relationship {{with the rest of}} Canada to be offered alongside <b>sovereignty,</b> as he thought this would encourage the Federal government to simply refuse to negotiate and cast the project as doomed, as had happened in 1980. As a practical matter, Parizeau believed that given the emotional circumstances of separation a special partnership was unlikely, and that given free trade agreements and other multilateral institutions it was unnecessary.|$|E

50|$|Early in {{the thirteenth}} century, the {{territory}} of Anatolia was invaded by Mongols. The weakening of Seljuq rule allowed Turkmen tribes known as the Oghuz Turks to organize themselves into independent <b>sovereignties,</b> the Beyliks.

5|$|When the anti-Swedish {{coalition}} however {{gained the}} upper hand, Frederick William changed sides when Polish king John II Casimir Vasa confirmed his <b>sovereignty</b> in Prussia, {{but not in}} Ermland, in the Treaty of Wehlau-Bromberg in 1657.

5|$|After decades, the Oneida became {{frustrated}} {{by the failure of}} the case to settle. Instead, they began to purchase land within the claim area in fee simple, asserting <b>sovereignty</b> over the re-acquired parcels and refusing to pay property tax. In City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York (2005), the Supreme Court held that laches barred the re-assertion of <b>sovereignty</b> over ancestral land re-acquired in fee simple; the Court did not consider whether the original aboriginal title over the disputed parcels was validly extinguished, and thus did not disturb its holding in Oneida II.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} reinforcements {{from the}} colonial headquarters at Batavia, the Dutch launched an attack in 1635 {{and were able}} to crush opposition and bring the area around present-day Tainan fully under their control. After seeing Mattau and Soulang, the most powerful villages in the area, defeated so comprehensively, many other villages in the surrounding area came to the Dutch to seek peace and surrender <b>sovereignty.</b> Thus the Dutch were able to dramatically expand the extent of their territorial control in a short time, and avoid the need for further fighting. The campaign ended in February 1636, when representatives from twenty-eight villages attended a ceremony in Tayouan to cement Dutch <b>sovereignty.</b>|$|E
