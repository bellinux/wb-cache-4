England were 88 without loss at the lunch interval, with Hutton and Washbrook on 46 and 41 respectively.

5|$|Johnston {{took the}} new ball with Miller and {{delivered}} 59 overs {{in the second}} innings to take 4/147 in Lindwall's absence. Johnston bowled without success {{in the first half}} of the innings; the closest he came to a wicket on the third afternoon when Len Hutton and Denis Compton were putting on a century partnership was when Compton aimed an uppish <b>square</b> <b>drive</b> from Johnston that flew in the air wide of cover point. On the fourth day, England continued to make steady progress and Johnston was unsuccessful although he was able to make the ball move sideways in the morning under cloudy conditions. He was then attacked by Hardstaff, who drove several fours through the off side and forced Bradman to remove Johnston. He returned to remove Barnett and English captain Norman Yardley late on the fourth day as the hosts’ neared 300. Barnett was caught by Miller in the slips and Johnston took a return catch to remove the English skipper. Johnston bowled 30 overs, the most of any bowler for the day, as England reached the penultimate evening on 345/6, a lead of one run. The next morning, Johnston removed Evans and bowled Jack Young to end England's innings at 441 on the final day. Johnston bowled the most overs of any player and was the leading wicket-taker for the match as Australia took a 10 leadthe Australian batsmen reached the target of 98 with eight wickets in hand.|$|E
5|$|This brought {{together}} England's leading batsmen, Hutton and Compton. The latter, coming in upon {{the fall of}} Edrich, ran down the pitch before the ball was bowled and had to quickly play a defensive shot on the run. He clipped the next ball to the leg side for two runs before surviving a confident leg before wicket appeal from Johnson {{when he was on}} eight. Compton appeared ready to walk off, but umpire Chester declined the appeal, much to his surprise. England reached 50 in 65 minutes and with Lindwall missing, Bradman had difficulties in spreading the workload among his depleted bowling resources. The part-time leg spin of Barnes was brought on as the fifth bowling option to give the others some time to rest, and Miller resumed bowling late in the day, delivering slow off spin to conserve energy. Hutton and Compton exploited the depleted bowling attack and began to score freely, using their placement to bisect the gaps between the fielders. The pair did not give a chance apart from when Compton aimed an uppish <b>square</b> <b>drive</b> from Johnston that flew in the air wide of cover point.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} the numerical simulation of internal recirculating flows encompassing a two-dimensional viscous incompressible flow generated inside a regularized <b>square</b> <b>driven</b> cavity {{and over a}} backward-facing step. For this purpose, the simulation is performed by using the projection method combined with a Chebyshev collocation spectral method. The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are formulated {{in terms of the}} primitive variables, velocity and pressure. The time integration of the spectrally discretized, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is performed by a second-order mixed explicit/implicit time integration scheme. This scheme is a combination of the Crank-Nicolson scheme operating on the diffusive terms and a second-order Adams-Bashforth scheme acting on the advective terms. The projection method is used to split the solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in two decoupled problems: the Burgers equation to predict an intermediate velocity field and the Poisson equation for the pressure, which is used to correct the intermediate velocity field and satisfy the continuity equation. Numerical simulations for flows inside a two-dimensional regularized <b>square</b> <b>driven</b> cavity for Reynolds numbers up to 10000 and over a backward-facing step for Reynolds numbers up to 875 are presented and compared with numerical results previously published, where good agreement is demonstrated...|$|R

Other cricketers who had an {{influence}} on him are: David Boon, Mohinder Amarnath, Kapil Dev and Allan Border. Ganguly is a left-handed batsman whose runs came primarily from the off-side. Debashish Dutta, author of Sourav Ganguly, the maharaja of cricket, commented that throughout his career, [...] "Ganguly played off-side shots such as the square cut, <b>square</b> <b>drive</b> and cover drive with complete command." [...] Rahul Dravid has called Ganguly [...] "...next to God on the off-side." [...] He used to hit powerful shots to the off-side on front and back foot with equal ease. However, {{early in his career}} he was not comfortable with the hook and pull, often giving his wicket away with mistiming such shots. He was also criticised for having difficulty in handling short bouncers, notoriously exploited by the Australians and South Africans. However, after his comeback in 2007, he worked upon these weaknesses to a large extent.|$|E
2500|$|A {{drive is}} a straight-batted shot, played by {{swinging}} the bat in a vertical arc {{through the line}} of the ball, hitting the ball in front of the batsman along the ground. It {{is one of the most}} common shots in a batsman's armoury and often the first shot taught to junior cricketers. Depending on the direction the ball travels, a drive can be a cover drive (struck towards the cover fielding position), an off drive (towards mid-off), straight drive (straight past the bowler), on drive (between stumps and mid-on) or <b>square</b> <b>drive</b> (towards point). A drive can also be played towards midwicket, although the phrase [...] "midwicket drive" [...] is not in common usage. Drives can be played both off the front and the back foot, but back-foot drives are harder to force through {{the line of the}} ball. Although most drives are deliberately struck along the ground to reduce the risk of being dismissed caught, a batsman may decide to play a lofted drive to hit the ball over the infielders and potentially even over the boundary for six.|$|E

Playing against England in the Fourth Test at the Adelaide Oval, Waugh came to the crease in the first innings on the first day with Australia in trouble at 4/104. The situation deteriorated when Australia fell to 5/126 and Greg Matthews joined Waugh at the crease. The pair batted {{until the end of the}} day and Waugh brought up his century with a <b>square</b> <b>drive</b> late on the first day. This made him the fifteenth Australian to make a century on debut. Phil Wilkins of The Sydney Morning Herald wrote that [...] "Such a maiden Test century could hardly have been surpassed for commanding presence". Waugh was widely lauded for the style and elegance of his innings. Waugh ended the day at 116 not out and was bowled early on the second morning for 138 by paceman Devon Malcolm to end a 171-run stand with Matthews. His innings had taken only 188 deliveries and featured heavy scoring through leg-side flicks. Waugh made 23 in the second innings and took his first Test catch, Mike Atherton, caught from the bowling of Bruce Reid. The match was drawn and Waugh experienced his first Test victory when he scored 26 in the Fifth Test at Perth as Australia sealed the series 3–0. His performances saw him selected for the early 1991 tour of the West Indies, to play in five Tests and five ODIs against the world's most powerful team.

Sockets are driven by being attached to the driving tool via a male/female square connection fitting (called the <b>square</b> <b>drive).</b> Standard sizes of square drives around the world include 1/4", 3/8", 1/2", 3/4", 1", 1-1/2", 2-1/2" [...] and 3-1/2" [...] <b>square</b> <b>drive</b> sizes (a de facto international standard with no metric equivalents) along with some lesser used drivers such as 5/8" [...] <b>square</b> <b>drive,</b> and both #4 and #5 spline drives specified in ANSI B107 specifications. This wide range of <b>square</b> <b>drive</b> sizes provides {{for a wide variety of}} socket types and sizes to suit small to very large nuts and bolts. Some square drivers have a through hole to attach the socket to the driver (using a retaining ring with o-ring and pin type, or single piece molded retaining rings), a locking pin, or friction ball. Some common hand ratchets employ a quick release button on their top for quick socket release of smaller sockets.The tool chosen to drive the socket wrench ultimately supplies the mechanical advantage needed by the user to provide the torque needed to loosen or tighten the fastener as may be required. Larger drivers are typically used with higher torque, while smaller drivers are used for convenience in smaller low torque applications. Given the limits of human strength and fatigue, torque above 600 ft-lbs of torque will generally involve some kind of power assist, instead of the user simply pushing on the handle of a wrench. Very large sockets and drivers are typically powered by hydraulics to achieve torque.|$|E

However, the parameter associated with the derivative term is very sensitive and was chosen in a narrow range for a high Reynolds number case. To avoid {{the use of the}} derivative term while removing the shortcoming of a relatively large viscosity, new lattice kinetic schemes are proposed in this work following the original lattice kinetic scheme.
