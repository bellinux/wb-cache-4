40|$|Abstract—This paper {{seeks to}} assess the {{implications}} of bank consolidation {{on the performance of}} <b>small</b> <b>and</b> medium scale enterprises in the Nigerian economy. Multiple linear regression technique and correlation matrix test were employed to measure the extent to which <b>small</b> <b>and</b> medium scale enterprises asset size, survival and access to credit were influenced. The result showed that bank deposit (BD) and bank credit (L or BC) impacted on asset size <b>and</b> survival of <b>small</b> <b>and</b> medium scale enterprises. None of the variables had significant impact on SMEs access to credit. There is a shift of focus by commercial banks away from <b>small</b> <b>and</b> medium scale enterprises (small customers), which is evidenced by the significant negative influence of bank credit to both the survival and asset size of <b>small</b> <b>and</b> medium enterprises. While micro finance banks work hard at providing funds to <b>small</b> <b>and</b> medium scale entrepreneurs, their capacity {{to meet the needs of}} these entrepreneurs is constrained.

None of these changes were specifically targeting <b>small</b> <b>and</b> medium enterprises although the majority of entities in Namibia can be classified as <b>small</b> <b>and</b> medium enterprises. Recognising the contribution made by <b>small</b> <b>and</b> medium enterprises, Government recently indicated that tax reform for <b>small</b> <b>and</b> medium enterprises should be treated as a priority. Differentiated tax treatment is applied in the United Kingdom and South Africa and aims to reduce the tax burden. Although previous studies have been carried out on differentiated tax treatment for <b>small</b> <b>and</b> medium enterprises, none of these studies were done from a Namibian perspective. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyse literature on taxation for <b>small</b> <b>and</b> medium enterprises in the United Kingdom and South Africa to recognize the advantages and disadvantages of tax policies aimed at the <b>small</b> <b>and</b> medium enterprises sector. The study also compared tax policies for <b>small</b> <b>and</b> medium enterprises in the United Kingdom and South Africa to recommend possible implementation for the Namibian tax system. Namibia should learn from these countries and apply the best practices. The study reached the conclusion that tax reform in Namibia for the <b>small</b> <b>and</b> medium enterprises sector is desperately needed and recommends that tax policies aiming at reducing the tax compliance burden should receive preference over those reducing the tax rate burden. This research may serve as the starting point for revised tax policies and legislation specifically aiming at <b>small</b> <b>and</b> medium enterprises.
