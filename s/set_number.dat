5|$|As of 17 August 2017 (Update 2.7), {{there are}} 34 hero options. The {{developers}} {{of the game}} continually add new heroes, each with different skills but balanced for fair play. For example, a hero may have high damage but poor mobility, or strong melee abilities but no ranged option. Players choose between three abilities that upgrade via a common technology tree. There is a <b>set</b> <b>number</b> of heroes that are free to play, with the free to play roster being renewed every week.|$|E
5|$|Hot Potato {{features}} seven {{missions and}} seven score challenges. Mission mode requires the player {{to clear out}} a <b>set</b> <b>number</b> of an alien species. There are multiple alien species in the mode and the mission does not finish until the player gets rid of enough of a certain species chosen by the game from the road. Score challenge mode tasks the player with clearing away {{a certain number of}} aliens in order to reach a pre-determined score. The game contains bonus levels which are longer than normal levels if the player is able to complete missions under a certain time period.|$|E
5|$|In Super Smash Bros., up to {{four players}} can play in {{multiplayer}} (Versus) mode, with the specific rules of each match being predetermined by the players.

5|$|In the balkline games, {{rather than}} drawing balklines {{a few inches}} from the corners, the entire table is divided into {{rectangular}} balk spaces, by drawing balklines a certain distance lengthwise and widthwise across the length of the table a <b>set</b> <b>number</b> of inches parallel out from each rail. This divides the table into eight rectangular balkspaces. Additionally, rectangles are drawn where each balkline meets a rail, called anchor spaces, which developed to stop a number of nursing techniques that exploited the fact that if the object balls straddled a balkline, no count limit was in place.|$|E
5|$|In {{the game}} the player must {{simultaneously}} drive a bus and clear roads of alien potato beings. The beings are scattered across the street, and by shooting out rows of alien potatoes, they can be cleared from the player's path.

Hot Potato received mostly above average reviews from critics; it received 66.42% and 74% ratings on review aggregate websites GameRankings and Metacritic respectively.|$|E

5|$|Battles {{occur when}} the player {{character}} encounters an enemy while traversing the world. Combat takes place in real-time, and in the location the player found the enemy rather than a separate battle screen. The main character can equip a variety of weapons, armors, and accessories. Weapons let the player perform abilities in combat. Referred to as Special Techs, these abilities are powerful attacks by the main characters and support characters {{that can be used}} when the special move meter is full. This meter fills as the player damages enemies. Each weapon, such as a sword or spear, has a <b>set</b> <b>number</b> of special attacks to learn, which can hit single or multiple targets and can be assigned to different buttons on the controller.|$|E

5|$|During the game, {{the player}} {{controls}} the onscreen character from a third-person perspective {{to interact with}} people, objects, and enemies. Like previous games in the series and most role-playing games, characters level up each time they earn a <b>set</b> <b>number</b> of experience points from defeating enemies; each level gained increases the character's statistics, thus improving their performance in battle. Statistic examples include hit points, the amount of damage a character can receive; magic points, which {{determine the number of}} times a character can use magical attacks; strength, the power of a character's physical attacks; and intelligence, the power of a character's magical spells. Upon encountering an enemy, the player can use a variety of weapons to attack and defeat the enemy. Despite the game being set in 2036, the weapon choices are largely medieval, including swords, axes, and spears, although handguns and a rocket-propelled grenade are available. These weapons differ in their damage output, the range of the weapon, and the speed of the attack.|$|E
5|$|Fire Brigade (<b>set</b> <b>number</b> 10197), {{released}} in September 2009, {{was the fourth}} set in the Modular Buildings series.

Modeled to look like a realistic 1930s fire station, the set includes a bell tower, an opening garage door, a 1930s style fire truck, and 4 minifigures with a fire-dog. Like Green Grocer, all floors in the Fire Brigade set are fully furnished. The Fire Brigade is the first Modular House to come with a vehicle, the 1930s style fire truck. The set also includes some new, unique pieces, such as gold fire helmets and a red sliding garage door.|$|E
5|$|Ninjago City (<b>set</b> <b>number</b> 70620), a large 4867 piece set, was {{released}} in late August {{to coincide with the}} release of the Lego Ninjago Movie. Although not advertised as a modular building, it features the same structure as the regular modulars with a 32x32 stud baseplate, building connectors and a river matching the same dimensions as the sidewalk. It is a huge 3-level model with each level themed differently. The bottom level contains an old fashioned fish market, the middle level contains a modern comic store and sushi bar, and the top floor contains a radio station. The set comes with 16 different minifigures.|$|E

5|$|Progression through Paper Mario {{depends upon}} {{interaction}} with the game's non-player characters (NPCs), who will often offer clues or detail the next event in the storyline. As in other RPGs, the player can find or purchase items from NPCs to help in and outside of combat. Badges can also be obtained that yield bonuses ranging from added moves to gradual health restoration during combat; each consumes a <b>set</b> <b>number</b> of Badge Points (BP), meaning Mario can only equip {{a limited number of}} badges at a time. Princess Peach is playable at particular points in the game as a recurring sidequest. The objectives and actions of each transition to Peach vary, although most are stealth-based.|$|E
5|$|The ship can {{be moved}} {{horizontally}} and vertically, but not diagonally. The player makes a <b>set</b> <b>number</b> of steps each turn, after which the artificial intelligence does the same for non-playable characters (NPCs). If the player's ship is not docked at a port {{at the end of}} a turn, the player can be attacked by an enemy ship or a sea creature. If they are attacked, a card minigame is triggered to decide if the player loses gold to a rival ship or cargo to a sea creature. The player and NPC draw coloured and numbered cards; the highest-numbered card wins each turn, unless presented against a powerful color. The strongest hue receives an attack bonus. The player's following turn starts after the minigame is completed.|$|E
5|$|Micro Machines 2: Turbo Tournament adds new modes: Leagues, Time Trials, Single Race, and Tournaments. In League mode, players {{compete for}} points in divisions. Seasons consist of four races. Players {{with the most}} points {{at the end of}} the season are {{promoted}} to the next division, and players with the least are relegated. Time Trial mode is where players race alone (although some tracks have a Shadow Racer representing the best time) for the best time, or to practise driving. Single Race is where players compete in a series of rounds in which vehicles begin at the centre of the scree, and get further apart as the race progresses. If a vehicle goes off the screen, they are out of the race unless they have travelled the furthest. The game ends when only one player remains. Tournaments are a fixed race series played in the same manner as Single Races. The winner is the first player to win a <b>set</b> <b>number</b> of times. There are two multiplayer-only modes: Knockout and Share Games. Knockout involves a series of races similar to tournament mode, with winners progressing to the next round and losers knocked out. Share Games is similar to Single Race, but cars are coloured according to team, with each team's finishing position depending on which member performs the best. The Mega Drive J-Cart provides two controller ports, enabling up to eight players in multiplayer by two players sharing the controllers. The Game Gear version retains the console sharing (two player sharing one console) function of the original, and two units can be linked.|$|E
