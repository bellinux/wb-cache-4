5|$|By {{this time}} Monteverdi {{was in his}} <b>sixties,</b> <b>and</b> his rate of {{composition}} seems to have slowed down. He had written a setting of Strozzi's Proserpina rapita (The Abduction of Proserpina), now lost except for one vocal trio, for a Mocenigo wedding in 1630, and produced a Mass for deliverance from the plague for San Marco which was performed in November 1631. His set of Scherzi musicali was published in Venice in 1632. In 1631, Monteverdi {{was admitted to the}} tonsure, and was ordained deacon, and later priest, in 1632. Although these ceremonies took place in Venice, he was nominated {{as a member of the}} clergy of Cremona; this may imply that he intended to retire there.|$|E

25|$|Undoubtedly {{the most}} famous name in modern Breton music is Alan Stivell, who popularized the Celtic harp first in the fifties and <b>sixties</b> <b>and</b> on a wider level since the 1970s, {{with a series of}} albums {{including}} most famously Renaissance de la Harpe Celtique (1971). His first harps were built by his father; the Celtic harp was long forgotten in Brittany before.|$|E

25|$|Henze {{lived with}} his partner Fausto Moroni from the early <b>sixties,</b> <b>and</b> Moroni planned and planted the {{hillside}} garden around La Leprara.

In 2007, shortly after Henze's sudden recovery, Moroni died after a lengthy battle with cancer. Elogium Musicum (2008), for large orchestra and chorus singing Henze's own Latin text, is a memorial to his partner of more than forty years.|$|E
25|$|During the War of Independence in 1948, Sharon was {{appointed}} {{head of the}} Government Planning Department, whose main challenge was where to settle the waves of immigrants who were arriving in the country, and in 1954 returned to his private architectural office.

As the city of Tel Aviv rose from three and four storey buildings to multi-storey buildings in the <b>Sixties</b> <b>and</b> Seventies, Sharon’s office designed many high-rise buildings for the government and for public institutions.|$|E

25|$|In the {{political}} arena, William Henry Hornby, a leading industrialist, the first mayor of Blackburn, and Chairman of the Conservative Party {{was born in}} the town in 1805. John Morley, 1st Viscount Morley of Blackburn, OM, PC, Liberal statesman, writer and newspaper editor {{was born in the}} town in 1838. The town is also closely linked to Barbara Castle who was an MP in Blackburn for 34 years (1945–1979) as well as holding the positions of Secretary of State for Employment and Productivity, First Secretary of State and Secretary of State for Social Services during the Labour governments of the <b>sixties</b> <b>and</b> seventies.|$|E
25|$|The 1951 census in Pakistan {{recorded}} 671,000 {{refugees in}} East Pakistan, {{the majority of}} which came from West Bengal. The rest were from Bihar. According to the ILO in the period 1951–1956, half a million Indian Muslims migrated to East Pakistan. By 1961 the numbers reached 850,000. In {{the aftermath of the}} riots in Ranchi and Jamshedpur, Biharis continued to migrate to East Pakistan well into the late <b>sixties</b> <b>and</b> added up to around a million. Crude estimates suggest that about 1.5 million Muslims migrated from West Bengal and Bihar to East Bengal in the two decades after partition.|$|E
25|$|The island {{suffers from}} a {{geographical}} position that exposes it to strong waves with multiple origins. One {{of these is the}} trade winds and above all affects the leeward east coast. Another explanation is the absence of dry land between the south seas and the shores of the Sud sauvage (the southeastern part of the island), which means that the screaming <b>sixties</b> <b>and</b> the furious fifties (terms invented by mariners to describe the powerful winds between those longitudes) can reach Réunion without meeting any obstacle. A third reason is that this French Overseas department lies {{in the path of the}} tropical cyclones that arise in the centre of the Indian Ocean.|$|E

25|$|Though Britpop {{is viewed}} as a {{marketing}} tool, and more of a cultural moment than a musical style or genre, there are musical conventions and influences the bands grouped under the Britpop term have in common, such as showing elements from the British pop music of the Sixties, glam rock and punk rock of the Seventies, and indie pop of the Eighties in their music. Britpop was a media driven focus on bands which emerged from the independent music scene of the early 1990s—and was associated with the British popular cultural movement of Cool Britannia which evoked the Swinging <b>Sixties</b> <b>and</b> the British guitar pop music of that decade.|$|E
25|$|Having {{considering}} the DC-8 Super <b>Sixties</b> <b>and</b> the Lockheed L-1011, Air New Zealand ordered eight DC-10-30s, {{the first of}} which arrived on 27 January 1973. The DC-10s introduced a new paint scheme, with a koru featuring on the tail in the style of a Maori waka (canoe) stern post instead of the previously displayed Southern Cross; this scheme spread to the DC-8s during 1973. The longer range of the DC-10 opened up routes to Asia and eliminated the stop at Manila on the Auckland to Hong Kong route in 1975. As well as expanding trans-Pacific services. The first service to Perth was started in 1980.|$|E
25|$|Before {{receiving}} his diplomas in trumpet, {{composition and}} instrumentation from the conservatory, Morricone was already active as a trumpet player, often performing in an orchestra that specialized in music written for films. After completing his education at Saint Cecilia, the composer honed his orchestration skills as an arranger for Italian radio and television. In {{order to support}} himself, he moved to RCA in the early <b>sixties</b> <b>and</b> entered the front ranks of the Italian recording industry. Since 1964, Morricone was also {{a founding member of}} the Rome-based avant-garde ensemble Gruppo di Improvvisazione di Nuova Consonanza. During the existence of the group (until 1978), Morricone performed several times with the group as trumpet player.|$|E
