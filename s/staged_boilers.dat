40|$|Over 2 quads {{of fossil}} fuels are used each year for {{moisture}} removal. This includes industrial and agricultural processes where feedstocks and final products must be dried, as well as comfort conditioning of indoor spaces where the control of humidity is essential to maintaining healthy, productive and comfortable working conditions. Desiccants, materials that have a high affinity for water vapor, can greatly reduce energy use for both drying and dehumidification. An opportunity exists to greatly improve the competitiveness of advanced liquid-desiccant systems by increasing the efficiency of their regenerators. It is common practice within the chemical process industry to use multiple <b>stage</b> <b>boilers</b> to improve the efficiency of thermal separation processes. The energy needed to regenerate a liquid desiccant, which is a thermal separation process, can also be reduced by using a multiple <b>stage</b> <b>boiler.</b> In this project, a two-stage regenerator was developed in which the first <b>stage</b> is a <b>boiler</b> and the second stage is a scavenging-air regenerator. The only energy input to this regenerator is the natural gas that fires the boiler. The steam produced in the boiler provides the thermal energy to run the second-stage scavenging-air regenerator. This two-stage regenerator {{is referred to as}} a 1 ?-effect regenerator. A model of the high-temperature stage of a 1 ?-effect regenerator for liquid desiccants was designed, built and successfully tested. At nominal operating conditions (i. e., 2. 35 gpm of 36 % lithium chloride solution, 307, 000 Btu/h firing rate), the boiler removed 153 lb/h of water from the desiccant at a gas-based efficiency of 52. 9 % (which corresponds to a COP of 0. 95 when a scavenging-air regenerator is added). The steam leaving the boiler, when condensed, had a solids concentration of less than 10 ppm. This low level of solids in the condensate places an upper bound of about 6 lb per year for desiccant loss from the regenerator. This low loss will not create maintenance problems nor will it significantly increase operating expenses. An energy balance on the boiler showed that heat loss through the insulated jacket was 10 %. This value is much higher than the 2 % to 5 % that is typical of most boilers and indicates a need to better insulate the unit. With insulation that brings jacket losses down to 5 %, a 1 ?-effect regenerator that uses this boiler as its high-temperature stage will have a gas-based COP of 1. 05. The estimated cost to manufacture a 300 -lb/h, 1 ?-effect regenerator at 500 units per year is $ 17, 140. Unfortunately, the very high cost for natural gas that now prevails in the U. S. makes it very difficult for a gas-fired LDAC to compete against an electric vapor-compression air conditioner in HVAC applications. However, there are important industrial markets that need very dry air where the high price of natural gas will encourage the sale of a LDAC with the 1 ?-effect regenerator since in these markets it competes against less efficient gas-fired desiccant technologies. A manufacturer of industrial dehumidification equipment is now negotiating a sales agreement with us that would include the 1 ?-effect regenerator...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{the comparison of}} several solar thermal, cogeneration and thermally driven heating/cooling central plant systems implemented into a typical mid-rise apartment, located in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. TRNSYS is used to model the system and predict the primary and secondary energy consumption, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and annual utility costs of the various systems and compared to the base case. The highest annual utility cost and GHG emission savings was attained by operating a cogeneration device in priority in a solar thermal, cogeneration with absorption heat pump plant, predicting a 21 % reduction in the annual utility cost and a 16 % reduction in GHG emissions. The system however has a higher secondary energy consumption, 10 % above the base case. Operating the solar thermal collectors in priority over the cogeneration unit in the same central plant the greatest primary and secondary energy savings were attained achieving 16 % and 18 % savings compared to the base case. GHG emission savings of 16 % was predicted with both operating strategies. Comparing this system to a cogeneration only system, secondary energy savings of 36 % are predicted demonstrating the benefit of adding solar thermal collectors and a thermally driven heat pump to a cogeneration system. Extending the operating period of the solar thermal and cogeneration system by adding a thermally driven chiller did not yield significant primary energy, secondary energy, GHG emission or utility cost savings over a heating only system. This is attributed to extended operating period of the single <b>stage</b> <b>boiler</b> with poor part load performance.

The main aim of this work is to improve mixing process incombustion chamber. To do this, the optimization of placementand direction of additional air and fuel nozzles, the physicalmodelling technique is used. By using that method, it ispossible to obtain qualitative information about processes,which occur in the real boiler. The numerical simulationsverify the results from physical modelling, because duringmathematical modelling quantitative informations about flow andmixing patterns, temperature field, species concentration areobtained. Two 3 D cases, before and after retrofit, of pulverized fuelfired boiler at 125 MW output thermal power are simulated. Theunstructured mesh technique {{is also used to}} discretize theboiler. The number of grid was 427 656 before retrofit and 513362 after retrofit. The comparisons of results of numericalsimulation before and after retrofit are presented.

Results present that nozzles of additional air and fuel givea considerably better mixing process, uniform temperature fieldand CO 2 mass fraction. The whole combustion chamber worksalmost as a "well stirred reactor", while upper part of boilerworks as a "plug flow reactor".

40|$|BACKGROUND: Biomass {{facilities}} have received increasing attention {{as a strategy}} to increase the use of renewable fuels and decrease greenhouse gas emissions from the electric generation and heating sectors, but these facilities can potentially increase local air pollution and associated health effects. Comparing the economic costs and public health benefits of alternative biomass fuel, heating technology, and pollution control technology options provides decision-makers with the necessary information to make optimal choices in a given location. METHODS: For {{a case study of}} a combined heat and power biomass facility in Syracuse, New York, we used stack testing to estimate emissions of fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5) for both the deployed technology (<b>staged</b> combustion pellet <b>boiler</b> with an electrostatic precipitator) and a conventional alternative (wood chip stoker boiler with a multicyclone). We used the atmospheric dispersion model AERMOD to calculate the contribution of either fuel-technology configuration to ambient primary PM 2. 5 in a 10 km x 10 km region surrounding the facility, and we quantified the incremental contribution to population mortality and morbidity. We assigned economic values to health outcomes and compared the health benefits of the lower-emitting technology with the incremental costs. RESULTS: In total, the incremental annualized cost of the lower-emitting pellet boiler was $ 190, 000 greater, driven by a greater cost of the pellet fuel and pollution control technology, offset in part by reduced fuel storage costs. PM 2. 5 emissions were a factor of 23 lower with the pellet boiler with electrostatic precipitator, with corresponding differences in contributions to ambient primary PM 2. 5 concentrations. The monetary value of the public health benefits of selecting the pellet-fired boiler technology with electrostatic precipitator was $ 1. 7 million annually, greatly exceeding the differential costs even when accounting for uncertainties. Our analyses also showed complex spatial patterns of health benefits given non-uniform age distributions and air pollution levels. CONCLUSIONS: The incremental investment in a lower-emitting <b>staged</b> combustion pellet <b>boiler</b> with an electrostatic precipitator was well justified by the population health improvements over the conventional wood chip technology with a multicyclone, even given the focus on only primary PM 2. 5 within a small spatial domain.

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{discusses}} {{the issue of}} modelling the heating and cooling processes of T-pipes in a power plant pipeline in the start-up conditions of a boiler. The main purpose of this work is {{the description of the}} mechanical behaviour of power plant components working under mechanical and thermal loading and validation of the computer modelling methods. Design/methodology/approach: The FEM modelling has been used to describe the local stress-strain behaviour of the chosen component. Findings: The reasons for the presence of high and variable in time temperature gradients in the components of the main steam pipeline include, among other things, variable values of the coefficient of heat transfer between the pipeline material and the medium flowing inside it, which, at this <b>stage</b> of <b>boiler</b> operation, may change its state. Unsteady operation of a pipeline, especially in case of subsequent boiler start-ups, may induce thermal stresses which exceed the values of allowable stress in components of complex shapes. Research limitations/implications: The possibility of applying the durability criteria currently assumed in standards still requires justification and confirmation in laboratory and industrial conditions to be closer to the real components behaviour. In such situation the presented analysis is the part of the complex investigation method which main purpose is increasing accuracy of the TMF process description and thermo-mechanical life assessment. Practical implications: The calculations carried out may constitute a basis for developing a material test parameters which would bring closer the fatigue conditions appearing locally in the analysed components. The method of stress-strain behaviour analysis used in the paper could be useful in the practical cases when the real components mechanical behaviour would be analysed. Originality/value: The main value of this paper is the own method of the mechanical behaviour analysis of the power plant component.

40|$|Abstract––This paper {{outlines}} the {{various stages of}} operation involved in the conversion of a manually operated boiler towards a fully automated boiler. Over the years the demand for high quality, greater efficiency and automated machines has increased in this globalised world. The initial phase of the paper focuses on passing the inputs to the boiler at a required temperature, so as to constantly maintain a particular temperature in the boiler. The Air preheater and Economizer helps in this process. And the paper mainly focuses on level, pressure and flow control at the various <b>stages</b> of the <b>boiler</b> plant. Thus {{the temperature in the}} boiler is constantly monitored and brought to a constant temperature as required by the power plant. The automation is further enhanced by constant monitoring using SCADA screen which is connected to the PLC by means of communication cable. By means of tag values set to various variable in SCADA the entire process is controlled as required. At the automated power plant, the boiler is controlled by Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) to put in action the required processes to be carried out at the boiler. Thus the entire cycle is carried out as a paper and at various stages each phase is detailed out.

40|$|During {{the last}} decades {{there has been a}} strive for {{recovery}} boilers with high steam outlet temperature, high pressure and load capacity. One of the reasons for this has been the increased profit from producing and selling green energy as a by-product from the Kraft pulping process. While the boilers performance has increased, the design and materials used have much remained the same as before and thus many modern paper mills have had problems with expensive equipment wastage. The annual maintenance outage is very costly for the mills when all the equipment must be inspected and, if needed, repaired. Each problem requires its specific personnel, time and spare parts which are all important resources. Furthermore security issues may require repairs to be queued and every hour is costly while production is stopped. Thus there is great value in reducing the risk of potential problems already in the design <b>stage</b> of the <b>boiler.</b> This thesis investigates how the choice of design and materials affect the annual maintenance shut down and the associated costs. The study has focused on the temperature distribution inside the superheaters, how it depends on the design and how in turn this affects the superheater corrosion. Apart from reviewing the theory behind this matter, raw steam data was collected from the mills and analyzed. Furthermore three actual cases of superheaters corrosion were investigated to find the cause of the corrosion and possible solutions. The studies revealed that many superheater corrosion problems could have been avoided using better materials and a design that reduces the temperature imbalances obtained with the conventional design. Since the pulp and paper industry focuses on buying the cheapest possible design, the costs of some design related problems were investigated. In the cases of superheater corrosion and superheater ties, these costs were compared to those of a more robust initial design. In these cases, {{it was found that the}} costs of repair and production losses caused by inadequate designs were high and that the life cycle cost of the boiler could be lower using designs with higher initial costs. Finally a design case where the maintenance perspective has been somewhat overlooked is described and followed by a suggested model for how the maintenance perspective could be included in new boiler project organizations...|$|R
40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis describes the fundamentals ofmathematical modeling for the industrial furnaces and boilersand {{presents the results}} from the numerical simulations of sometypical applications in advanced industrial furnaces andboilers. The main objective of this thesis work is to employcomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) technology as an effectivecomputer simulation tool to study and develop the newcombustion concepts, phenomena and processes in advancedindustrial furnaces and boilers. The applications concern onfrom retrofitted conventional grate boilers to the mostadvanced highly preheated and diluted air combustion (HPDAC) furnaces. In this work, several topics are specially concernedwhen applying CFD technology to combustion cases. These topicsare including grate bed model, NOxmodeling, mixing problem, air staging system, andhighly preheated and diluted air combustion technology. In thiswork, a black-box grate bed model is developed and used inmodeling of grate fired furnaces and boilers. It is based onthe thermodynamic calculations and a set of conservationequations of mass, energy of fuel and air on the grate bed. Oneof benefits of this bed model is simple and feasible to be putinto use in industry. For NOxmodeling, besides the thermal NO and prompt NO,the HCN route fuel NO has been employed to predict the fuel NOemissions in coal/biomass fired furnaces. In addition, based onNH 3 route of fuel NO formation, a SNCR scheme for NOxabatement has been proposed also. For mixingproblem, the concepts of global degree of mixing and individualdegree of mixing have been proposed and used successfully inpractical applications. The new definition of degree of mixingovercomes some shortages of existed mixing parameters, such asthe mixing factor and the degree of non-mixing, which arenon-normalized and may lose physical meaning in some regions ofthe system. A new air staging system has been studied. It isused to improve the secondary or over-fire air configuration,thus to reduce the pollutant emissions and to enhance thecombustion facilities' efficiencies. In this work, the airstaging system has been employed in coal and biomass combustionfor grate fired furnaces/boilers. The performance of the newair staging system has been evaluated and optimized by usingnumerical modeling method together with physical modelingmethod. Results show that the new air staging system has a goodpotential of improving the combustion quality and reducing thepollutant emissions in industrial furnaces and boilers. Recently, the highly preheated and diluted air combustiontechnology has been regarded as the new generation energytechnology for advanced industrial furnaces and boilers. Inthis work, the highly preheated and diluted air combustionphenomena have been studied by using different numericalmodels. A hybrid procedure of both the large eddy simulationusing subgrid-scale stress Smagorinsky model and the Reynoldsstress model with eddy dissipation model has been alsoinvestigated to study the dynamic combustion process under theconditions of highly preheated and diluted air combustion. Results show that HPDAC technology possesses advantages ofsaving energy and low NOxemission, thus it has high potential to be usedfor the next generation of industrial furnaces and boilers. Thelarge eddy simulation using subgrid-scale stress Smagorinskymodel together with Reynolds stress model / eddy dissipationmodel are possible to study the HPDAC dynamic process. Finally,this work shows that numerical modeling method is a verypromising tool to deal with the complicated combustionprocesses even for practical applications in industry.

40|$|Large scale power {{generation}} commences with the combustion of coal or other fuel, {{which in turn}} converts high pressure water into steam which then drives a turbine thus generating electricity. Burning high moisture coal, such as lignite, for {{power generation}} implies that {{a significant amount of}} energy is wasted in vaporising the moisture, which could otherwise be used in the steam raising process. This implies that more moist coal would be required to drive the same process than if the coal was drier, thus increasing the amount of combustion products such as greenhouses gases. Introducing a dried coal in an existing boiler will significantly change the heat flux profiles, which could result in boiler damage or excessive fouling. Flame temperature is influenced by the supply of reactants; in most cases the limiting reactant will be oxygen. The supply of oxygen (through air) to a pneumatically transported coal stream and subsequent reaction is controlled by the localised fluid mechanics or ‘mixing’. This research aims to provide an understanding of the mixing process between the pneumatically transported coal and air in brown coal fired boilers by modelling the individual jets. The effects of the change in velocity ratio for the air (secondary) jets and fuel (primary) jets of rectangular burners typical of those found in brown coal fired boilers has been studied experimentally and is reported in this thesis. In particular, scientific analysis was used to investigate the physical mechanisms which control fuel-air mixing, and to quantify the concentration of primary and secondary fluid. The concentration data was used in a regression model in conjunction with a reactive combustion model, developed from a 1 : 30 scale cold model of the Yallourn W’ <b>stage</b> 2 <b>boiler,</b> in order that overall boiler performance can be assessed. This overall study is fundamental {{as a result of the}} questions raised concerning the future of brown coal in modern society. A qualitative flow visualisation study of the unconfined 1 : 30 scaled primary, and two adjacent rectangular jets, was conducted using single colour planar laser induced fluorescence. The characteristics of the jet flow were examined by imaging individually seeded primary and secondary jets and were visualised through four different planes longitudinally, on the axes of each jet. In addition, a transverse qualitative and quantitative study on the rectangular jets was also conducted for the individually seeded jets, and was visualised through planes of flow perpendicular to the direction flow, specifically at axial stations of x/D = 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 5, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8. The flow characteristics were also examined under different co-flow conditions, particularly secondary to primary jet velocity ratios (λ) of 0, 0. 55, 1. 4, 2. 8, 3. 6 and ∞. This quantitative data yields the basis for a 3 D regression model to predict fuel-air mixing in actual boilers. A semi-quantitative investigation into some geometrical modifications on the rectangular jets was also conducted at velocity ratios of λ= 0, 0. 55 and 1. 4. The rectangular nozzles were fitted with base plates orientated at 90 degrees and 60 degrees to the direction of flow. The longitudinal flow visualisation study highlighted the effect of velocity ratio on the flow field of the primary and secondary jets. In particular it showed that the main structures of the primary and secondary jets are sensitive to the co-flowing conditions. The primary jet also experienced the formation of coherent structures close to the bluff body re-circulation region for λ> 2. 8. The quantitative transverse analysis of the rectangular jets showed that the primary jet and secondary jets close to the nozzle exit plane distorted with a change in co-flowing conditions. The primary jet experienced distortion for λ> 1. 4, and the secondary jets experienced distortion for λ < 1. 4. A plausible mechanism for this “distortion” can be explained by different co-flowing conditions altering the velocity gradients of the jet, thus changing the denomination of the counter rotating vortices present in the corners of rectangular jets, allowing them to alter jet shape. The transverse quantitative analysis of the rectangular jets allowed for graphical representation of the normalised concentration of the primary and secondary jets in the radial direction and the centreline mixture fraction decay. The analysis of the latter showed that the primary jet, under all co-flow conditions, reached self-similarity at approximately x/D = 4, whereas the secondary jets did so at x/D = 2. The primary jets observed greater rates of centreline dilution at high velocity ratios, whereas the secondary jets did so at λ= 0. 55. The quantification of the centreline concentration decay obeyed the inverse rate law for all co-flowing conditions. The first order decay constant K₁, was found to be heavily dependant on velocity ratio. The planar transverse quantitative data of the primary and secondary jets was used with the method of weighted squares to develop a regression model that would three-dimensionally reproduce the scalar mixing field as a function of velocity ratio. The regression model reproduces scalar quantities for λ= 0 and λ= 0. 55 to 3. 6 for the primary jet and λ= 0. 55 to 3. 6 and ∞ for the secondary jet, and is capable of predicting primary and secondary bulk fluid concentrations within 30 to 40 % of the measured values. A sensitivity analysis on the regression model revealed that it is highly responsive to the momentum-controlling region between the jets with a change in velocity ratio. Thesis (Ph. D.)
