40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop and estimate demand models for residential telephone network <b>subscription</b> and <b>calling</b> demands, where the household is the basic decision unit. The analysis assumes that households consider the subscription-calling rate structure in determining the household telephone service demands and that the demands are conditioned by the socio-demographic characteristics of the household. Model estimation requires household network <b>subscription</b> and <b>calling</b> data under different rate structures. Because alterations to the subscription-calling rate structure are both infrequent and small in magnitude, stated-preference experimental design methods are employed as an alternative data source. The household's subscription probability is assumed logit while the calling demand equations are assumed a seemingly unrelated system. The model is estimated by continuous/discrete econometric methods. Estimates of the parameters are provided for the economic variables and socio-demographic variables specifications of the model for the Sydney Metropolitan Area, Penrith and New South Wales Country regions. The estimates indicate that both the household network <b>subscription</b> and <b>calling</b> demands are affected by the rate structure and household socio-demographic variables. Base and hypothetical rate structure scenario simulations for the Sydney Metropolitan Area show that rate structures substantially impact on quarterly household telephone communication expenditures...|$|R
