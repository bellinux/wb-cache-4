5|$|In {{the first}} winter after the dedication, {{soldiers}} practiced flying and servicing aircraft in <b>subzero</b> weather conditions. More than 1,000 workers, {{most of whom}} were hired from outside Alaska, worked on the project through 1941. Despite these outside workers, the construction effort caused unemployment to almost vanish in Fairbanks, causing a large demand for labor. Fairbanks' economy grew, and the city's second/www.akhistorycourse.org/articles/article.php?artID=178> radio station, KFAR, began broadcasting on October 1, 1939. Hangars and base buildings were completed in summer 1941, but the second winter of cold-weather testing was interrupted by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{inhabit the}} tropics, {{as well as}} {{temperate}} and boreal waters. A number of species can survive and even flourish in extreme conditions. They are abundant in the Arctic, about 140 species being known from that zone. The Antarctic scallop, Adamussium colbecki, lives under the sea ice {{at the other end}} of the globe, where the <b>subzero</b> temperatures mean that growth rates are very slow. The giant mussel, Bathymodiolus thermophilus, and the giant white clam, Calyptogena magnifica, both live clustered around hydrothermal vents at abyssal depths in the Pacific Ocean. They have chemosymbiotic bacteria in their gills that oxidise hydrogen sulphide, and the molluscs absorb nutrients synthesized by these bacteria. The saddle oyster, Enigmonia aenigmatica, is a marine species that could be considered amphibious. It lives above the high tide mark in the tropical Indo-Pacific on the underside of mangrove leaves, on mangrove branches, and on sea walls in the splash zone.|$|E
25|$|In the Underworld Unleashed storyline, {{the demon}} Neron grants Mr. Freeze {{the ability to}} {{generate}} <b>subzero</b> temperatures, no longer needing his freeze-gun or refrigeration suit. However, after his encounter with Green Lantern, Donna Troy, and Purgatory in Central Park, he reverted to his original <b>subzero</b> biology. He then gained a new <b>subzero</b> armor and weaponry.|$|E
25|$|The {{temperature}} in Beiping is <b>subzero</b> {{during the month}} of October, and the Yan defenders poured water on the city walls at nightfall. As the walls were covered in ice the next day, the government forces were prevented from scaling the walls.|$|E
25|$|The liquid {{activated}} high-energy mixture {{can be used}} {{by itself}} for casting small architectural details and decorative items, or foamed (expanded) for lightweight concrete. HEM Nanoconcrete hardens in low and <b>subzero</b> temperature conditions and possesses an increased volume of gel, which reduces capillarity in solid and porous materials.|$|E
25|$|Eggs {{of species}} of {{mosquitoes}} from the temperate zones are {{more tolerant of}} cold than the eggs of species indigenous to warmer regions. Many even tolerate <b>subzero</b> temperatures. In addition, adults of some species can survive the winter by taking shelter in suitable microhabitats such as buildings or hollow trees.|$|E
25|$|If disturbed, {{woolly bear}} {{caterpillars}} will roll {{into a tight}} spiral or drop from their perch suspended by a strand of silk. Isabella tiger moths (Pyrrharctia isabella) overwinter in the caterpillar stage. They can survive freezing at moderate <b>subzero</b> temperatures by producing a cryoprotectant chemical. The larvae of another species, Phragmatobia fuliginosa, may be found on snow seeking a place to pupate. Species in Arctic and temperate belts overwinter in larval stage.|$|E
25|$|During {{the dawn}} of {{aviation}} in pre-war Northern Canada, aviators flew with flight engineers who were responsible for preparing the radial engines for shutdown and startup to reduce the effects of <b>subzero</b> temperatures. The flight engineer was responsible for draining the oil into buckets at night, and preheating the engine and buckets of oil using a blanket wrapped around the engine and a device known as a blow pot – essentially a kerosene jet-heater used for several hours prior to flight.|$|E
25|$|They hunt {{their prey}} using scent, passive hearing, and echolocation. Their main calls {{have a wide}} {{bandwidth}} and are multiharmonic, with a peak amplitude of 27 to 28kHz. They also make shorter pulsed, frequency modulated calls. The bats enter torpor in cold weather and stay in their roosts for up to 10 {{days at a time}} before emerging to feed. They may also enter daily torpor when roosting alone. However, they are capable of remaining active even in <b>subzero</b> temperatures when necessary.|$|E
25|$|In mid-2004 it was {{announced}} that the lineup of Bearer, Neuman, Chickie, and Cronin were again rehearsing and planned on playing a show to serve both as a reunion and as the final farewell the band was never able to give. The reaction from fans led to the booking of another show the following night, and on October 9 and 10, the band played two sold out shows at CBGB, alongside opening bands such as Inhuman, Murphys Law, The Distance and <b>Subzero.</b> Footage from both nights, as well as an extensive documentary, was released as the Beaten By The Fists Of God DVD in 2005. Many high-profile members of the punk rock and hardcore community were featured praising the band in the documentary, including members of Dropkick Murphys, Life of Agony, and Blood For Blood. Many former members were interviewed as well.|$|E

The film was re-released in April 2004 as a three disc DVD box set that included <b>SubZero</b> and Return of the Joker. That version is currently out of print. Warner Home Video re-released the film again in February 2008 as a double feature DVD with <b>SubZero.</b> The film {{was released}} as part of the Warner Archive Collection on Blu-ray on July 25, 2017, featuring new high definition transfers of [...] and [...] presentations of the film.|$|E
500|$|The {{variety of}} unusual, numerous, and {{frequently}} placed ways for the player to die were {{singled out for}} praise. Focusing on the harm caused by <b>subzero</b> temperatures during winter, Meunier found that [...] "these interesting wrinkles add depth and additional difficulty to the already challenging survival mechanics at play." [...] Jessica Conditt of Joystiq praised {{the high number of}} possible causes of death as well as the game's efficient and easy-to-understand display of the player's health, hunger, and mental stability. Saldana noted that the unfamiliarity of some monster designs would help to keep the player wary.|$|E
500|$|Outside the {{sheltered}} {{urban areas}} of Fairbanks, Whitehorse, and Dawson City, temperatures and snowfall {{are often more}} extreme. During the 2008 race, competitors started in [...] temperatures in Fairbanks and then faced winds of [...] on the trail, resulting in severe wind chills. At higher elevations, such as the crossings of Rosebud and Eagle summits, whiteout blizzards are common. In the 2006 race, 12 teams were struck by a massive storm that eventually caused the evacuation of seven teams by helicopter. In 2009, mushers endured winds up to , blowing snow, and <b>subzero</b> temperatures atop Eagle Summit, where conditions had been even worse in a storm during the 1988 race, when wind chill temperatures dropped below [...]|$|E
500|$|On {{the night}} of November 30, Rangel {{was part of a}} {{retreating}} vehicle column that was trapped and attacked by Chinese forces. [...] In the <b>subzero</b> cold, Rangel was injured in the back by shrapnel from a Chinese shell. [...] He later wrote that the blast threw him into a ditch and caused him to pray fervently to Jesus. [...] Up and down the line of the retreat, unit cohesion disappeared under attack and officers lost contact with their men. [...] There was screaming and moaning around him and some U.S. soldiers were being taken prisoner, but despite feeling overwhelming fear Rangel resolved to try to escape over an imposing mountain: [...] "From the rim of that gully it just looked like everything had to be better {{on the other side of}} that damn mountain." ...|$|E
500|$|The entire {{company of}} musicians {{traveled}} {{together in one}} bus, although the buses used for the tour were wholly inadequate, breaking down and being replaced with astounding frequency. [...] Griggs estimates that five separate buses {{were used in the}} first 11 days of the tour -- [...] "reconditioned school buses, not good enough for school kids." [...] The artists themselves were responsible for loading and unloading equipment at each stop, as no road crew assisted them. Adding to the disarray, the buses were not equipped for the weather which consisted of waist-deep snow in several areas and varying temperatures from the 20s to as low as -36°F. [...] One bus had a heating system that broke down shortly after the tour began, in Appleton, Wisconsin. [...] Later, Richardson and Valens began experiencing flu-like symptoms and drummer Bunch was hospitalized for severely frostbitten feet, after the tour bus simply broke {{down in the middle of}} the highway in <b>subzero</b> temperatures near Ironwood, Michigan. The musicians replaced that bus with another school bus and kept traveling. After Bunch was hospitalized, Carlo Mastrangelo of The Belmonts took over the drumming duties. When Dion and The Belmonts were performing, the drum seat was taken by either Valens or Holly. As Holly's group had been the backing band for all of the acts, Holly, Valens, and DiMucci took turns playing drums for each other at the performances in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and Clear Lake, Iowa.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Legends of the Dark Knight", {{an episode}} of The New Batman Adventures, three {{teenagers}} discuss their ideas about what Batman is really like. They briefly meet a youth called Joel whose idea of Batman reflects characterizations and costumes portrayed within Schumacher's Batman and Robin. The teens treat Joel's ideas with utter disdain. In Watchmen, director Zack Snyder and comic book artist Dave Gibbons chose to parody the molded muscle and nipple Batsuit design from Batman & Robin for the Ozymandias costume. The film is referenced in the [...] episode [...] "Legends of the Dark Mite!", when Bat-Mite briefly uses his powers to transform Batman's costume into the same suit shown in the Schumacher Batman films, before declaring it [...] "Too icky". The Batman from Batman & Robin later appeared {{as part of an}} army of Batmen gathered from across the Multiverse in [...] "Night of the Batmen!", complete with the blue rubber Batsuit. Additionally, there were worries within Warner Bros. surrounding the negative critical reaction to Batman & Robin and how that may come to harm the success of the subsequent direct-to-video animated film , which was originally planned for release at around the same time as Batman & Robin but was subsequently delayed. However, <b>SubZero</b> received a far stronger positive response from critics than Batman & Robin, with Mr. Freeze's role within it being seen in a much more positive light, returning his popularity as a Batman villain to a level comparable to that reached by him within the two Emmy-winning episodes the character featured in of [...]|$|E

2500|$|Steele {{formed the}} band in 1989 {{along with his}} {{childhood}} friends Josh Silver, Kenny Hickey and Sal Abruscato (later replaced by Johnny Kelly). The band originally used the name [...] "Repulsion", but had to change name in 1990 due to legal issues with the American grindcore band of the same name. The band then used the name [...] "Subzero". Steele had a tattoo of a minus sign contained within the number 0 that he originally intended to represent the <b>Subzero</b> band logo. After discovering that another band was already using the <b>Subzero</b> name, and with his tattoo in mind, Steele {{came up with the}} name [...] "Type O Negative" [...] after hearing a radio advertisement requesting donations of type O negative blood.

2500|$|The Lost Hammer Spring, {{located in}} the central west region of the island (...) is the coldest and saltiest of all Arctic springs {{described}} to date. It {{is characterized by a}} perennial hypersaline (24%) discharge at <b>subzero</b> temperatures (~) flowing to the surface through a hollow, [...] high cone-shaped salt tufa structure. Continuous gas emissions from the spring indicate an underlying thermogenic methane source.

2500|$|It was {{designed}} by the Edmonton firm of Manasc Isaac to be environmentally sustainable. Its central atrium has a curtain wall with photovoltaic cells, the largest such structure in Canada, and the second largest worldwide, {{at the time of}} the building's completion. Five percent of the building's electricity comes from that wall; it is used to heat water, some of which comes from the building's green roof and local groundwater, resulting in the building using half as much water as a comparably sized building. Heating efficiency is such that the building remains adequately warm during <b>subzero</b> winter days when many adjacent offices have to close. The building's green design reportedly saves CDN$80,000 in energy costs and reduces greenhouse gas emissions by [...] each year.|$|E
2500|$|Another torture {{method is}} the [...] "Television" [...] which {{involves}} forcing the victim {{to stand in}} a mid-squat with extended {{arms in front of}} them holding a stool or even two stools, with the seat facing them.

Other torture methods include the [...] "Rack" [...] or [...] "Stretch" [...] which involves hanging a victim on hands tied behind the back, the [...] "Refrigerator" [...] which involves subjecting a naked victim sometimes doused in cold water to <b>subzero</b> temperatures, the [...] "Furnace" [...] where the victim is left in heat in a small space and [...] "Chinese torture" [...] where the feet of the victim laying on a tabletop are beaten with clubs.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the stacks}} of {{materials}} at the station sites mounted, construction went ahead rapidly. Subcontractors with a flair for tackling difficult construction projects handled the bulk of this work {{under the direction of}} Western Electric engineers. Huge quantities of gravel were produced and moved. The construction work needed to build housing, airstrips, aircraft hangars, outdoor and covered antennas, and antenna towers was done by subcontractors. In all, over 7,000 bulldozer operators, carpenters, masons, plumbers, welders, electricians, and other tradesmen from the US and southern Canada worked on the project. Concrete was poured in the middle of Arctic winters, buildings were constructed, electrical service, heating, and fresh water were provided, huge steel antenna towers were erected, airstrips and hangars were built, [...] putting it all together in darkness, blizzards, and <b>subzero</b> cold.|$|E
2500|$|Between {{removal from}} donor and {{transplantation}} into the recipient the liver is cooled in an ice-cold preservation solution. The cold temperature slows down deterioration and solution {{is designed to}} counteract the unwanted effects of cold ischemia. Besides this method of static cold storage, various dynamic preservation methods are under development, including machine perfusion. Machine perfusion restores a flow through the liver while it's outside the body (ex vivo). This is currently being investigated at cold (hypothermic), body temperature (normothermic), and under body temperature (subnormothermic). Hypothermic machine perfusion has been used successfully at Columbia University and at the University of Zurich. A 2014 study published in Nature Medicine showed that the liver preservation time could be significantly extended using a technique called Supercooling, which preserves the liver at <b>subzero</b> temperatures (-6nbsp&°C) ...|$|E
