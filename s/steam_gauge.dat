500|$|On {{the morning}} of 21 July 1905, Benningtons crew was {{preparing}} her to sail {{to the aid of}} the monitor [...] which had broken down and was in need of a tow. After her crew had finished the difficult task of coaling the ship that morning, most of them were belowdecks cleaning themselves from the dirty job. Unbeknownst to anyone on board, three problems with one of Benningtons boilers – oily feed water, an improperly closed steam valve, and a faulty <b>steam</b> <b>gauge</b> – were conspiring against them. At about 10:30, excessive steam pressure in the boiler resulted in a boiler explosion that rocked the ship, sending men and equipment flying into the air. The escaping steam sprayed through the living compartments and decks. The explosion opened Benningtons hull to the sea, and she began to list to starboard. Quick actions by the tug Santa Fe — taking Bennington under tow and beaching her – almost certainly saved the gunboat from sinking.|$|E

50|$|Galyonkin was {{inspired}} by <b>Steam</b> <b>Gauge</b> to create Steam Spy. At the time, Galyonkin was a Senior Analyst at Wargaming.net. Steam Spy uses the same approach of sampling {{a small percentage of}} Steam accounts, approximately 100,000 to 150,000 per day with a rolling sampling approach. The collected data is processed nightly to create visualizations used on the site, and thus offers historical trends for games as well. As with <b>Steam</b> <b>Gauge,</b> Galyonkin notes that Steam Spy is subject to similar sampling errors, so that data for newly released games or for games with low sales will not likely have accurate estimates of numbers. The polling approach is also prone to promotions that Valve runs, such as when a game is offered for free over a weekend; during this time, the game will appear owned on every Steam profile, and will artificially bump up the sales numbers. Galyonkin's method also polls {{the amount of time that}} each profile has played a particular game, allowing him to collect estimated playtime statistics on a per-game basis.|$|E

50|$|In 1906, Arthur Batcheller {{joined the}} Boston, Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad (BRB&LR) as a {{locomotive}} fireman. After his {{education at the}} Boston YMCA Electrical Engineering School, Batcheller returned to the railroad as assistant chief electrician. Arthur Batcheller left the railroad in 1914 and joined the Eastern Steamship Corporation as chief electrician until 1916. Batcheller then became assistant chief with the American <b>Steam,</b> <b>Gauge</b> and Valve Manufacturing Company from 1916 to 1917. He was appointed Radio Inspector for Boston during World War I and continued in this position until late 1918. As Radio Inspector, he was given security clearance to board German ships in Boston Harbor and seal off their transmitting equipment.|$|E
5000|$|The {{idea for}} Steam Spy {{originally}} {{came from a}} similar approach used by Kyle Orland and the website Ars Technica for their [...] "Steam Gauge" [...] feature starting in April 2014. <b>Steam</b> <b>Gauge</b> uses the Steam API to access publicly available user profiles to obtain a list of games that that user owns. At {{the time of its}} creation there were over 170 million Steam accounts, making the task of polling the entire list of games impractical. Instead, they opted to poll between 80,000 to 90,000 each day as to collect the game lists, and then used sampling statistics to estimate the total ownership of each game. Ars Technica estimated at its onset that the margin of error was within 0.33%.|$|E
50|$|According {{to records}} {{regarding}} the Oneida, {{she was leaving}} port carrying payment for sales of ammunition and gunpowder to the Japanese government. Around 1955, Takeshita Hisao led an effort to salvage the loaded payment, {{as well as other}} artifacts from the Oneida wreck. Artifacts including coins, ammunition shells, rifles, and further bones from deceased sailors and passengers were found. The recovered <b>steam</b> <b>gauge</b> was later donated to the United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka. In 2010, a special aired 9 November on Fuji Television made a further effort at salvage with the help of Takeshita's family and one of the divers from the 1955 effort. The show's salvage team located a shipwreck that matched descriptions of the Oneida, and efforts continue to discover more about the wreckage and remaining contents.|$|E

5000|$|Security {{in the use}} of {{machinery}} is provided for by precautions as regards the cleaning {{of machinery}} in motion and working between the fixed and traversing parts of self-acting machines driven by power, by fencing of machinery, and by empowering inspectors to obtain an order from a court of summary jurisdiction to prohibit the use, temporarily or absolutely, of machinery, ways, works or plant, including use of a steam boiler, which cannot be used without danger to life and limb. Every hoist and fly-wheel directly connected with mechanical power, and every part of a water-wheel or engine worked by mechanical power, and every wheel race, must be fenced, whatever its position, and every part of mill-gearing or dangerous machinery must either be fenced or be in such position that it is as safe as if fenced. No protected persons may clean any part of mill-gearing in motion, and children may further not clean any part of or below manufacturing machinery in motion by aid of mechanical power; young persons further may not clean any machinery if the inspector notifies it to the occupier as dangerous. Security as regards the use of dangerous premises is provided for by empowering courts of summary jurisdiction, on the application of an inspector, to prohibit their use until the danger has been removed. The district council, or, in London, the county council, or in case of their default the factory inspector, can require certain provisions for escape in case of fire in factories and workshops in which more than forty persons are employed; special powers to make by-laws for means of escape from fire in any factory or workshop are, in addition to any powers for prevention of fire that they possess, given to every district council, in London to the county council. The means of escape must be kept free from obstruction. Provisions are made for doors to open outwards in each room in which more than ten persons are employed,/and to prevent the locking, bolting or fastening of doors so that they cannot easily be opened from inside when any person is employed or at meals inside the workplace. Further, provisions for security may be provided in special regulations. Every boiler for generating steam in a factory or workshop or place where the act applies must have a proper safety valve, a <b>steam</b> <b>gauge,</b> and a water gauge, and every such boiler, valve and gauge must be maintained in proper condition. Examination by a competent person must take place at least once in every fourteen months. The occupier of any factory or workshop may be liable for penal compensation not exceeding £Ioo in case of injury or death due to neglect of any provision or special rule, the whole or any part of which may be applied {{for the benefit of the}} injured person or his family, as the secretary of state determines. When a death has occurred by accident in a factory or workshop, the coroner must advise the factory inspector for the district of the place and time of the inquest. The secretary of state may order a formal investigation of the circumstances of any accident as in the case of mines. Careful and detailed provisions are made for the reporting by occupiers to inspectors, and entry in the registers at factories and workshops of accidents which occur in a factory or workshop and (a) cause loss of life to a person employed there, or (b) [...] are due to machinery moved by mechanical power, molten metal, hot liquid, explosion, escape of gas or steam, electricity, so disabling any person employed in the factory or workshop as to cause him to be absent throughout at least one whole day from his ordinary work, (c) are due to any other special cause which the secretary of state may determine, (d) not falling under the previous heads and yet cause disablement for more than seven days' ordinary work to any person working in the factory or workshop. In the case of (a) or (b) notice has also to be sent to the certifying surgeon by the occupier. Cases of lead, phosphorus, arsenical and mercurial poisoning, or anthrax, contracted in any factory or workshop must similarly be reported and registered by the occupier, and the duty of reporting these cases is also laid on medical practitioners under whose observation they come. The list of classes of poisoning can be extended by the secretary of state's order.|$|E

40|$|Technological {{evolution}} is a naturally occurring phenomenon in {{fields such as}} aviation technology which deal with a multitude and variation of control systems and the complex devices they operate. Prior to the 1980, the concept of aviation electronics or avionics dealt primarily with communication and navigation systems, {{most of which were}} based on radio principles of one form or another. Nowadays, avionics has found its way into virtually every system aboard modern complex aircraft. As traditional <b>steam</b> <b>gauge</b> type instruments are replaced by cathode ray tube and liquid crystal displays, an understanding of these devices has become a necessary addition to many courses in the airframe and powerplant curriculum. While the Federal Aviation Administration (2004) regulates course content in their Part 147 section of the Code of Federal Regulations to a large degree, a substantial portion of this responsibility also rests with the individual aviation technology school. In order to provide students with sufficient knowledge of these advanced systems in addition to the basics, adjustments have to be made to the curriculum from time to time. In the university setting, this responsibility often lays with a curriculum committee working in concert with involved faculty. This combined effort is not always without problems and is especially complicated by the need to satisfy the requirements of both the university and the FAA. The Aviation Technologies Department at Southern Illinois University recently undertook such an effort. In addition to dealing with policies of the university and the FAA, a short timeframe was also placed in the committee necessitating a highly proactive approach to implementing the curricular changes to effect the necessary additions. This article discusses our approach to the process and some conclusions drawn from the experience...|$|E
