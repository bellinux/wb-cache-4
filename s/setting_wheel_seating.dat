The diameter [...] of the <b>wheel</b> <b>seat</b> is slightly larger than the machined hole in the wheels {{in order to make}} for a press fit [...] The wheels are then pressed on at something like [...] until they hit the raised shoulders and the wheels are now in the standard gauge position. The roller bearing seats are not modified so as to still suit the Irish gauge bogies.|$|R

Original prototypes contained a full glass roof {{similar to that}} of the Subaru SVX, though it was deemed [...] "too radical" [...] and abandoned. Applying lessons learned from the Edsel, customer input played an instrumental role in the Taurus' development, as many components including radios, steering <b>wheels,</b> <b>seats,</b> <b>wheels,</b> and entire suspension setups were selected by large numbers of average people though a series of surveys conducted by Ford. In addition, Ford disassembled many competing cars such as the Toyota Camry, the Honda Accord, and the more luxurious BMW 5 Series in order to examine their parts and components.|$|R

50|$|Consider the {{relation}} of an automobile to its parts, specifically: the automobile has or is composed from objects including steering <b>wheel,</b> <b>seat,</b> gearbox and engine. This relation might be fixed in a computer program as a composition relation. However, the real world relation is softer and fuzzier. The engine in one automobile may {{be replaced by the}} engine from another automobile, meaning {{the relation}} is better described as an aggregation than a composition. Generally speaking, as time passes, what looks like compositions tend to turn into aggregations, and aggregations tend to turn into looser associations.|$|R

Eddie quickly becomes a Buddhist (because he wants to be reincarnated as a bra, or as Claudia Schiffer), Richie decides that they should start to pray, to which Eddie asks [...] "Who to, Buddha?" [...] and Richie replies [...] "No, none of that old supermodel cobblers, good old C of E" [...] and they pray to God. A giant hand stretches out to save them and the two climb on moments before the Ferris <b>Wheel</b> <b>seats</b> fall to the ground. Eddie turns to Richie and states [...] "Although we—and indeed the whole BBC—respect people's rights to believe in whatever they wish…"; at this point he turns to the camera and breaks the fourth wall of theatre and parenthetically adds, [...] "Because we don't want to get into the shit on this one."; turning back to Richie he finishes with [...] "We don't actually believe in God."
