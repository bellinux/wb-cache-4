When she did not return home her husband went to the mall and found her car, a 1985 Ford Tempo, with the tires slashed. It is believed that Chandler, after scoping out the victim {{over a couple of}} days, slashed the tires and <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> guise of a good samaritan and offered to help. Three hours after she was reported missing, her body was found under a residential mailbox, in a local neighborhood, by two men returning from a fishing trip.|$|E

5|$|Although O'Malley was {{loyal to}} his {{employees}}, {{he did not}} take kindly to demands from employees such as manager Charlie Dressen's request for a three-year contract. When Dressen requested a multi-year contract after losing a second consecutive World Series to the Yankees, he was released. Then when he hired Walter Alston as a replacement, he made it clear to the press that Alston would only receive one-year contracts and would not attempt to show up the management in the national media. There were rumors that Alston even signed blank contracts in the fall and <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spring to find out his salary. O'Malley also did not support those who remained friends with Rickey, which was a large factor in Red Barber quitting as Dodgers announcer.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{featured}} matches was between John Cena versus Sabu in an Extreme Rules lumberjack match, a standard match {{with the exception}} that the ring {{is surrounded by a}} group of wrestlers not directly involved in it and competed under hardcore rules. On the television debut of ECW on Sci Fi on June 13, a brawl broke out between Rob Van Dam and Edge. Edge, who stormed through the ECW crowd, was attacked by Cena, who cost Cena the WWE Championship at ECW's One Night Stand, and written into the storyline, sought revenge against Edge. Following the attack, Cena went to ringside where he knocked ECW Representative Paul Heyman unconscious, after Heyman awarded the pinfall win to Van Dam at One Night Stand. Following the attack, Heyman announced that all ECW superstars would be at Raw the following week. The following week on Raw, Heyman appeared alongside ECW superstar, Balls Mahoney, who was booked to face Cena in a singles match. The match was won by Cena after he made Mahoney submit. After the match, Cena was attacked by ECW superstar Sabu, who in the premiere of ECW on Sci Fi won a 10-man Extreme Battle Royal, a multi-competitor match type in which wrestlers are eliminated until one is left and declared winner, where the winner would face Cena at Vengeance in a singles match. Sabu assaulted Cena in which he performed a leg drop on Cena, diving onto him and putting Cena through the Raw announcers' table. The following night on an episode of ECW on Sci Fi, Cena <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ECW locker room, where he challenged Sabu to an Extreme Rules lumberjack match, for which Sabu accepted.|$|E

25|$|Realism {{began to}} {{influence}} American drama, partly through Howells, but also through Europeans such as Ibsen and Zola. Although realism was most influential in set design and staging—audiences loved {{the special effects}} offered up by the popular melodramas—and {{in the growth of}} local color plays, it also <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> more subdued, less romantic tone that reflected the effects of the Civil War and continued social turmoil on the American psyche.|$|E
25|$|Coming {{into the}} series, the White Sox {{had the best}} record and the best {{pitching}} staff in the AL. That good pitching <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first game, with Quintana only giving up one run in eight innings of work, wasting another good start of Steven Wright, who gave up two runs in six innings. Boston took a five inning lead in the second game, off of a David Ortiz home run, earning the first win for Clay Buchholz. Craig Kimbrel preserved the 5–2 win with his ninth save. In game three, the Red Sox scored {{in each of the}} first three innings and never looked back, taking the rubber match 7–3.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} {{grouping}} of his plays begins with his histories and comedies of the 1590s. Shakespeare's earliest plays {{tended to be}} adaptations of other playwright's works and employed blank verse and little variation in rhythm. However, after the plague forced Shakespeare and his company of actors to leave London for periods between 1592 and 1594, Shakespeare began to use rhymed couplets in his plays, along with more dramatic dialogue. These elements <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Taming of the Shrew and A Midsummer Night's Dream. Almost all of the plays written after the plague hit London are comedies, perhaps reflecting the public's desire at the time for light-hearted fare. Other comedies from Shakespeare during this period include Much Ado About Nothing, The Merry Wives of Windsor and As You Like It.|$|E

25|$|Mamoru {{struggles with}} his {{identity}} and function throughout the series, worrying first about his true nature, then later whether {{he gets in}} the way of the Sailor Soldiers. A fair amount of subtle characterization is made for Mamoru, and later extending his role within the manga as to who he is. He also is given the power of psychometry, which also <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> anime, but was not given a name. This manifests in his ability to see and read dreams (such as Chibiusa's), to heal people and to monitor the status of the Earth. This does not develop fully until the Black Moon arc, and is used occasionally throughout the series. Mamoru also has his left ear pierced in the manga, a trait that does not carry over to his anime counterpart.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} get work as an actor, Reuss began an {{elaborate}} subterfuge. He retreated to a cabin he owned up in the mountains. There he lived and studied the mannerisms of the local Tyrolian farmers, while letting his hair and beard grow. He practiced at adapting their ways of speech and movement. After a year, he <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> created persona of Kaspar Brandhofer, a Tyrolian peasant, having grown a full beard. To further hide his identity, he dyed all of his hair, head and body, by bathing every ten days in diluted hydrogen. He also had obtained papers {{from one of the}} peasants he had been observing in the mountains. Armed with this new Christian identity, he began presenting himself as a naturally taught actor. Having worked with director Max Reinhardt years before, Reuss was fearful that the director would recognize him, but Reinhardt did not. In fact, his ability so impressed the director, that Reinhardt recommended him to Ernst Lothar, in Vienna.|$|E
25|$|BC Šiauliai firmly {{expanded}} their bronze medals {{collection in the}} 2009–10 season. As year before, they began with the LKF Cup bronze, winning versus Nevėžis Kėdainiai 76–79. Derrick Low (23 points, 6 assists) and Deividas Gailius (21 points) led BC Šiauliai to the close victory back then. Derrick Low also participated in the 2010 LKL Three-point Shootout contest, winning first such title for the club. In the tournament final he scored 22 points and outperformed Adas Juškevičius who scored 21. BC Šiauliai won another thriller 84–83 in the BBL bronze final versus BK Ventspils after Vytautas Šarakauskas buzzer-beater. The referees counted it in, however BK Ventspils submitted a protest by telling that it was made after time. BBL accepted their protest and decided to rematch the game on Sunday. Though, BK Ventspils club did not <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game and technically lost it 20–0. BC Šiauliai players were awarded with the club's third BBL bronze medals set. They also captured their season' third bronze medals in the LKL bronze final by defeating Juventus Utena in the third series game 87–67, winning the series 3–0. It was the club's seventh straight LKL bronze medals set. Following the outstanding season ending, team leader Mindaugas Kuzminskas, who averaged 16.7 points and 6 rebounds per game in LKL, signed with the legendary Žalgiris Kaunas.|$|E

25|$|Kapil {{made his}} Test cricket debut in Faisalabad, Pakistan on 16 October 1978. Although his match figures were unimpressive, the numbers did not convey any measure of Kapil's {{contribution}} in the match. With his speed and bounce, he brought glee to the Indian players as the Pakistani batsmen were startled with bouncers that struck their helmets {{on more than}} one occasion. Kapil also captured his maiden wicket of Sadiq Mohammad with his trademark outswinger. He showcased his all-rounder talent when he scored India's fastest Test half-century off 33 balls and 2 sixes in each of the innings during the 3rd Test match at National Stadium, Karachi, although India lost the match and the series 2–0. In the ensuing series against a visiting West Indies team, he scored his maiden Test century (126) at Feroz Shah Kotla, Delhi in just 124 balls and had a steady bowling performance (17 wickets at 33.00). Ominous signs of Kapil's liking for England <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ensuring series, his first outside the sub-continent. Kapil picked up his first 5-wicket haul and all of England's wickets, although it came at a huge cost (48 overs and 146 runs conceded) as England scored a mammoth 633 and won the match comfortably. Kapil finished the series with 16 wickets though his batting haul of 45 runs (Average: 7.5) was unimpressive. His debut in ODI Cricket happened in the earlier tour of Pakistan where his individual performance was ordinary and it stayed the same as both Kapil and India had a poor campaign at the 1979 Cricket World Cup.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} {{home for a}} series against the Colorado Rockies. Clayton Kershaw threw seven shutout innings {{in the first game}} of the series, leading the Dodgers to a 6–0 victory. In the second game, the Dodgers dropped the contest 3–2 in ten innings as reliever Octavio Dotel threw three wild pitches that led to the go-ahead run scoring. The Dodgers came up on top in the final game of the series, when Ted Lilly pitched a complete game, two-hit shutout and Reed Johnson hit a two-run home run for the only runs of the game, 2–0. The Cincinnati Reds came to town for the next series. The Reds came into the series with a streak of not having won a game at Dodger Stadium since 2005. They snapped that streak the first game, when Reds starter Homer Bailey shut down the Dodgers offense and the Reds capitalized on a throwing error by Dodger starter Carlos Monasterios to pull out a 3–1 victory. Monasterios started the game after Vicente Padilla was placed on the 15-day disabled list. The Dodgers offense, dormant for much of the second half of the season, finally <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second game of the series. The Dodgers slugged back-to-back homers in both the second and third innings off Reds starter Johnny Cueto and held on for an 8–5 victory. However, the bats vanished again the following day as the Dodgers lost 5–2 despite a strong start from Clayton Kershaw, who struck out 11 in seven innings. In an effort to bolster their catching corps, depleted by Russell Martin's season-ending injury, the Dodgers acquired Rod Barajas off waivers from the New York Mets on August 22.|$|E
