We also find that there is a <b>spin</b> drift-diffusion crossover field for a process in which the drift and diffusion contribute equally to the <b>spin</b> current, which suggests a possible method of identifying whether the process for a given electric field is in the <b>spin</b> drift or <b>spin</b> diffusion regime. <b>Spin</b> drift-diffusion crossover fields for GaAs are calculated and are found to be quite small.
