50|$|<b>SDL</b> <b>Trados</b> Studio has {{integrated}} {{machine translation}} and postediting into its translation workflow. If the appropriate parameter setting is made, <b>SDL</b> <b>Trados</b> Studio will insert a machine translation of a translation unit (TU) if no match {{is found in}} the translation memory. The translator can then post-edit the machine translation for added clarity. <b>SDL</b> <b>Trados</b> currently supports the following MT systems: Language Weaver, SDL BeGlobal, SDL LanguageCloud and Google Translate. <b>SDL</b> <b>Trados</b> Studio also supports the integration of Microsoft Translator and other MT system through its open API and plugin architecture on the SDL OpenExchange.|$|E
50|$|According to the ICU Translation Memory Survey from 2006, <b>SDL</b> <b>Trados</b> {{is used by}} a {{total of}} 75% of {{surveyed}} users - 51% used Trados with a further 24% <b>SDL</b> <b>Trados</b> (See table 21).|$|E
50|$|The {{company also}} claims to support <b>SDL</b> <b>Trados</b> packages, which allows {{using it as}} an {{environment}} to work on projects originally intended for <b>SDL</b> <b>Trados,</b> including generation of return packages to be further handled in Trados, although the degree of such support has been contested by SDL representatives.|$|E
50|$|Content {{producers}} with preferred or previous {{language service}} agreements to third LSPs may prefer {{to maintain their}} independence and purchase software licences only. However, a combined option of technology solution and language services in one package {{is bound to be}} more cost effective. Similarly, LSPs may prefer to contact technology vendors who {{are not part of the}} competition, offering also language services. Many LSPs got nervous when <b>SDL</b> bought <b>Trados</b> in 2005, becoming the biggest translation technology provider, while still having language services as part of their activities.|$|R

50|$|A {{number of}} {{solutions}} {{have been created}} for handling the different versions of Trados file formats, but the process is not failproof. SDL did apparently respond to user complaints of licensing complexity and problems by simplifying the licensing scheme used in the <b>SDL</b> <b>Trados</b> Studio 2011 Freelance release. Successive versions of <b>SDL</b> <b>Trados</b> Studio resolved most of the backward compatibility issues.|$|E
50|$|A survey done by Proz.com in 2013 {{indicated}} that 73% of the translators have <b>SDL</b> <b>Trados.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In December 2010 SDL {{launched}} the SDL OpenExchange, {{now known as}} SDL AppStore, a web portal allowing independent developers to leverage the software's open architecture to create applications and plug-ins for <b>SDL</b> <b>Trados</b> Studio. [...] Apps can be downloaded to add functionality missing from the base product, such as legacy file support and new machine translation plugins. [...] As of 15 December 2011 over 25,000 apps have been downloaded.|$|E
50|$|The Professional Edition is a {{stand-alone}} solution which is particularly suited for localization projects of a medium to large size. It supports operations covering compound modules. As the edition is integrated with <b>SDL</b> <b>Trados</b> and SDL MultiTerm, translation {{data can be}} exported {{in order to use}} while translating relevant manuals and online help. It can also be used for data exchange with other systems. The integrated script development environment also makes it possible to change or add functions to SDL Passolo.|$|E
50|$|Proprietary formats {{for other}} environments which are {{supported}} to various extents include Star Transit project packages (PXF, PPF), <b>SDL</b> <b>Trados</b> Studio (SDLPPX, SDLXLIFF), oder Trados formats (TTX, bilingual DOC/RTF) and Wordfast Pro (TXML). In the case of project package formats, translation file and translation memory exchange generally work well, but other package information such as terminology or settings data may not be transferable. With translation file formats {{there are also some}} limitations associated with particular elements, such as footnote structures in bilingual DOC/RTF files from Wordfast or Trados Workbench.Terminology export also supports a configuration of the proprietary XML definition used by SDL MultiTerm.|$|E
5000|$|TM {{technology}} only became {{commercially available}} on a wide scale in the late 1990s, so the efforts made by several engineers and translators. Of note is the first TM tool called Trados (<b>SDL</b> <b>Trados</b> nowadays). In this tool, when opening the source file and applying the translation memory so that any [...] "100% matches" [...] (identical matches) or [...] "fuzzy matches" [...] (similar, but not identical matches) within the text are instantly extracted and placed within the target file. Then, the [...] "matches" [...] suggested by the translation memory can be either accepted or overridden with new alternatives. If a translation unit is manually updated, then it is stored within the translation memory for future use {{as well as for}} repetition in the current text. In a similar way, all segments in the target file without a [...] "match" [...] would be translated manually and then automatically added to the translation memory. Another significant milestone of TMS is the projects at IBM's European Language Services (Denmark) in which massive translation memory were used to remove language barrier.|$|E
5000|$|... memoQ, a {{translation}} environment tool first released in 2006, {{was the first}} product created by Kilgray Translation Technologies, a company founded in Hungary by the three language technologists Balázs Kis, István Lengyel and Gábor Ugray. The name of the company {{was derived from the}} last names of its founders. In the years since the software was first presented, it has grown in popularity and is now among the most frequent TEnT applications used for translation (it was rated as the second most widely used tool in a June 2010 survey of 458 working translators), along with <b>SDL</b> <b>Trados,</b> Déjà Vu, OmegaT and others. Today it is available in desktop versions for translators (Translator Pro edition) and project managers (Project Manager edition) as well as a server application offering integration with the desktop versions and a web browser interface. There are currently several active online forums in which users provide each other with independent advice and support on the software's functions as well as many online tutorials created by professional trainers and active users.Before its commercial debut, a version of memoQ (2.0) was distributed as postcardware.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The author will {{compare and}} {{evaluate}} two translation softwares Déjà Vu X (DVX) and <b>SDL</b> <b>Trados</b> 7. 0 {{mainly from the}} following three aspects from his own E-C translation experience: the terminology databases, translation memories, and working interfaces used in DVX and <b>SDL</b> <b>Trados</b> 7. 0 respectively, and will accordingly highlight {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of both softwares with his owning experience and comprehension, in the hope that this paper will be of certain help for their choice, application and evaluation of both CAT tools. Déjà Vu X and Trados 7. 0 Déjà Vu X (DVX) and Trados 7. 0 are two popular, powerful and customizable CAT systems developed by ATRIL and <b>SDL</b> <b>TRADOS</b> respectively. Both softwares combine Translation memory (TM) technology with Example Based Machine Translation (EBMT) techniques in the hope of improving translation productivity and consistency for translation agencies and freelance translators. The DVX terminology database VS. the Multiterm terminology database used in Trados Whilst translating the similar source texts from English into Chinese, both terminology databases (referred to as “termbase ” hereinafter) functioned well and were of great help to the translating th...|$|E
40|$|Vector {{graphics}} play {{an important}} role in the field of image localisation, nevertheless, the subject of vector graphics localisation has not been sufficiently researched to this date. The purpose of this Master's thesis is to determine if CAT tools or image editors (in particular <b>SDL</b> <b>Trados</b> Studio 2015 and Inkscape 0. 91) are better suited for the localisation of SVG files vy translation students or novice translators with little or no image localisation experience. Three characteristics laid out by the EAGLES evaluation method (functionality, usability and efficiency) and their corresponding sub-characteristics (suitability, accuracy, understandability, learnability, operability, attractiveness and the time behaviour) were analysed and evaluated through feature inspection, scenario test and questionnaire. The results of the study suggest that the CAT tool <b>SDL</b> <b>Trados</b> Studio 2015 is better suited for the localisation of Scalable Vector Graphics by users with little or no experience in the field...|$|E
40|$|Automated {{translation}} (machine translation, MT) is systematically gaining {{popularity among}} professional translators, {{who claim that}} editing MT output requires less time and effort than translating from scratch. MT technology is also offered in leading translator’s workstations, e. g., <b>SDL</b> <b>Trados</b> Studio, memoQ, Déjà Vu and Wordfast. Therefore, the dilemma arises: should MT be introduced into formal translation training? In order to answer this question, first, {{it is necessary to}} understand how trainee translators actually use MT...|$|E
40|$|Although Machine Translation is {{very popular}} for {{personal}} tasks, its use in lo-calization and other business applications is still very limited. The paper presents an experiment on the evaluation of an English-Latvian SMT system integrated into <b>SDL</b> <b>Trados</b> which {{has been used in}} an actual localization assignment by a professional localization company. We show that such an integrated localization environment can increase the productivi-ty of localization by 32. 9 % without a critical reduction in quality. ...|$|E
