5|$|The Muslim force, now {{numbering}} around 700, {{was stationed}} {{on the slopes}} of Uhud, facing Medina with the rear being protected by the towering mount itself. Before the battle, Muhammad had assigned 50 archers on a nearby rocky hill at the West side of the Muslim camp. This was a <b>strategic</b> <b>decision</b> in order to shield the vulnerable flanks of the outnumbered Muslim army; the archers on the hill were to protect the left flank, while the right flank was to be protected by the Mount of Uhud situated {{on the east side of}} the Muslim camp. Protecting the flanks of the Muslim army meant that the Meccan army would not be able to turn around the Muslim camp, and thus the Muslim army wouldn't be surrounded or encircled by the Meccan cavalry, keeping in mind that the Meccan cavalry outnumbered the Muslim cavalry with a 50:1 ratio.|$|E
25|$|According to Corner, Kinichi, and Keats, <b>strategic</b> <b>decision</b> {{making in}} {{organizations}} occurs at two levels: individual and aggregate. They developed {{a model of}} parallel <b>strategic</b> <b>decision</b> making. The model identifies two parallel processes that involve getting attention, encoding information, storage and retrieval of information, strategic choice, strategic outcome and feedback. The individual and organizational processes interact at each stage. For instance, competition-oriented objectives {{are based on the}} knowledge of competing firms, such as their market share.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper has}} focused on {{understanding}} different types of corporate <b>strategic</b> <b>decisions</b> and the underlying factors associated with major <b>strategic</b> <b>decisions</b> based on primary and secondary data collection. Primary data has been collected through structured interview of thirty five senior level employees of a leading multinational organization operating in the Energy Sector using well designed questionnaire. The outcomes of interviews were validated by reviewing research papers {{in the areas of}} <b>strategic</b> <b>decisions.</b> It was observed that there is strong alignment in thought process of Industry leaders as well as research scholars. The key <b>strategic</b> <b>decisions</b> are about defining the legal structure of an organization, defining the business portfolio, defining the organization structures and defining the manufacturing systems. Under each of these <b>strategic</b> <b>decisions,</b> there are different sub-options available for defining the direction of the organization. The internal as well as external factors influence the <b>strategic</b> <b>decisions.</b> There are internal factors such as structure, cultural web, resources that influence the <b>strategic</b> <b>decisions.</b> The external factors are also of two types—around the Industry or around the Economy. The industry factors are market structure, demand, government policies, task environment. The Economy factors are political- legal forces, economic forces, technological forces and socio-cultural forces...|$|R

Therefore, identification of <b>strategic</b> <b>decisions</b> in this industry has attracted increasing attention of managers and researchers. This study aims to identify and evaluate <b>strategic</b> <b>decisions</b> in the National Iranian Gas Company, using DEMATEL method for the first time. For data collection, paired comparison questionnaire have been used. The results of the research show that expanding operations to enter a new market, opening and starting up a new plant or facility, expansion of capacity and restructuring are respectively the most important <b>strategic</b> <b>decisions</b> in the industry.

It was also learned around this time that the two missing missionaries feared captured in Korea had in fact managed to escape to China. This news contributed to the decision to leave.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{this lesson}} {{was slow to}} sink in and at first the VOC made the <b>strategic</b> <b>decision</b> to improve its {{military}} position on the Malabar Coast (hoping thereby to curtail English influence in the area, and end the drain on its resources from {{the cost of the}} Malabar garrisons) by using force to compel the Zamorin of Calicut to submit to Dutch domination. In 1710, the Zamorin was made to sign a treaty with the VOC undertaking to trade exclusively with the VOC and expel other European traders. For a brief time, this appeared to improve the Company's prospects. However, in 1715, with EIC encouragement, the Zamorin renounced the treaty. Though a Dutch army managed to suppress this insurrection temporarily, the Zamorin continued to trade with the English and the French, which led to an appreciable upsurge in English and French traffic. The VOC decided in 1721 that it was no longer worth the trouble to try to dominate the Malabar pepper and spice trade. A <b>strategic</b> <b>decision</b> was taken to scale down the Dutch military presence and in effect yield the area to EIC influence.|$|E
25|$|Strategic {{management}} provides overall {{direction to}} the enterprise and involves specifying the organization's objectives, developing policies and plans designed {{to achieve these}} objectives, and then allocating resources to implement the plans.

Strategic management is not static in nature; the models often include a feedback loop to monitor execution and inform the next round of planning.|$|E

25|$|The {{capacity}} of the new stadium was set to be approximately 50,000 seats made by Ducharme Seating. The reduction in capacity was a <b>strategic</b> <b>decision</b> by Stanford's Athletics Program to boost season ticket sales and create a more intimate playing atmosphere without sacrificing the ability to host large world-class events, such as the FIFA World Cup in the future. This was partially the result of San Francisco's failure to secure a bid for the 2012 Olympics, which would have featured a renovated Stanford Stadium as the main Olympic Venue.|$|E

In view of those considerations, the Court could not conclude that additional mitigating evidence would have given rise to a reasonable probability that the trial judge would have sentenced Washington to life in prison rather than death.|$|E

25|$|Swarming is not {{a panacea}} for {{conflict}} at all levels. If {{there is a significant}} military force preventing the system administrator from working on developing connections, {{the other part of the}} paradigm comes into play: the leviathan, a first-world military force that takes down the opposition regular forces. Leviathan is not constituted to fight local insurgencies, but major forces. Leviathan may use extensive swarming at the tactical level, but its dispatch is a <b>strategic</b> <b>decision</b> that may be made unilaterally, or by an established core group such as NATO, ASEAN, or the United Nations.|$|E
25|$|The Mamluks, {{continuing}} {{the policy of}} the Ayyubids, made the <b>strategic</b> <b>decision</b> to destroy the coastal area and to bring desolation to many of its cities, from Tyre in the north to Gaza in the south. Ports were destroyed and various materials were dumped to make them inoperable. The goal was to prevent attacks from the sea, given the fear of the return of the crusaders. This had a long-term effect on those areas, which remained sparsely populated for centuries. The activity in that time concentrated more inland.|$|E
25|$|The {{historian}} Carl Leban attributes Cao Cao's {{victory to}} one single <b>strategic</b> <b>decision</b> — the defender's choice of location.

It was the issue about logistics that prompted Cao Cao to abandon the defence at the Yellow River. By luring Yuan Shao far south into Guandu, Cao Cao had forcibly extended Yuan Shao's supply lines and was thus able to pounce on his logistical disadvantage to gain a decisive victory.|$|E

25|$|During the American Civil War, American cotton exports slumped {{due to a}} Union {{blockade}} on Southern ports, {{and also}} because of a <b>strategic</b> <b>decision</b> by the Confederate government to cut exports, hoping to force Britain to recognize the Confederacy or enter the war. This prompted the main purchasers of cotton, Britain and France, to turn to Egyptian cotton. British and French traders invested heavily in cotton plantations. The Egyptian government of Viceroy Isma'il took out substantial loans from European bankers and stock exchanges. After the American Civil War ended in 1865, British and French traders abandoned Egyptian cotton and returned to cheap American exports, sending Egypt into a deficit spiral {{that led to the}} country declaring bankruptcy in 1876, a key factor behind Egypt's occupation by the British Empire in 1882.|$|E
25|$|Will Mulcaster {{argued that}} while much {{research}} and creative thought {{has been devoted}} to generating alternative strategies, too little work has been done on what influences the quality of <b>strategic</b> <b>decision</b> making and the effectiveness with which strategies are implemented. For instance, in retrospect {{it can be seen that}} the financial crisis of 2008–9 could have been avoided if the banks had paid more attention to the risks associated with their investments, but how should banks change the way they make decisions to improve the quality of their decisions in the future? Mulcaster's Managing Forces framework addresses this issue by identifying 11 forces that should be incorporated into the processes of decision making and strategic implementation. The 11 forces are: Time; Opposing forces; Politics; Perception; Holistic effects; Adding value; Incentives; Learning capabilities; Opportunity cost; Risk and Style.|$|E

25|$|Norsk Data took a <b>strategic</b> <b>decision</b> {{to abandon}} their role as system suppler for a few, large {{customers}} and {{decided to become a}} European-wide minicomputer supplied which could compete directly with American manufacturers. Sintran III was launched as a further development of Sintran II which included Nord-TSS and introduced virtual memory, which was launched with a new generation of hardware, the Nord-10, in 1973. CERN later followed up with purchasing a Nord-10 in 1975 for their largest department. Additional orders were made {{and by the end of}} 1976 CERN were operating fifty ND computers. The delivery to CERN combined with a more efficient software portfolio with the Nord-10 were key factors in the continued growth. For instance, ND delivered a turn-key system for meteorology in Algeria in 1974, complete with software developed in-house. Half the company's revenue came from international sales that year.|$|E
25|$|As {{darkness}} fell, {{the rest}} of D.H. Hill's division came up followed by Longstreet, while on the Union side, George Morrell's division arrived and relieved McCall, whose men were nearly out of ammunition. There was not enough daylight remaining to deploy D.H. Hill and Longstreet's divisions. Jackson did not attack, but his presence near Porter's flank caused McClellan to order Porter to withdraw after dark behind Boatswain's Swamp, five miles (8km) to the east. McClellan was concerned that the Confederate buildup on his right flank threatened his supply line, the Richmond and York River Railroad north of the Chickahominy, {{and he decided to}} shift his base of supply to the James River (he also believed that the demonstrations by Huger and Magruder showed that he was seriously outnumbered). This was a <b>strategic</b> <b>decision</b> of grave import because it meant that, without the railroad to supply his army, he had to abandon his siege of Richmond.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, ISTHA made a <b>strategic</b> <b>decision</b> {{to expand}} and improve the tollway system instead of {{converting}} the roads to freeways. It adopted a $6.3 billion Congestion Relief Program. Under the program, the main toll plazas were rebuilt to have open road tolling, so that drivers with transponders would drive at normal speeds under toll collecting equipment instead of stopping to pay tolls. The toll plazas were relocated {{to the side of}} the road to handle vehicles without transponders. The plan also included rebuilding and widening many of the toll roads, including most of the original portion of I-88 and the northern and southern sections of I-294. I-355 was extended south of I-55 to connect to I-80 in New Lenox, a distance of , in order to serve fast-growing areas of Will County. The project also includes adding an interchange between the Tri-State Tollway and I-57. These improvements were financed by long-term revenue bonds that require the system to remain as toll roads until the bonds are repaid in 2034.|$|E
