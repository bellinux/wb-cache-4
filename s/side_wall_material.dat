The research question {{is based on the}} lack of information on how the frequency content of the late arriving sound energy affects listener envelopment, but also on the conclusion that envelopment is an affect to large degree of late lateral reflective sounds. A computerized model is used for the purpose to take the research of listener envelopment into a more real acoustical situation than before. Alterations of the late lateral reflections are done by using four <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> <b>materials</b> attaining different sets of absorptions coefficients. A listening test is used for evaluating the change of listener envelopment and 21 listeners conducted the test. Results from earlier research were used to explain the attained results from the ANOVA tests. Sidewall materials which absorbs high frequencies and those that are nonabsorbent creates larger sensations of listener envelopment than materials in which absorbs low, low-mid and mid frequencies in this particular hall.

50|$|Instead, {{the station}} {{platforms}} consist of two chambers linked by cross tunnels, each having two platforms {{on top of}} each other. The side of each chamber was made up of two drift tunnels, one at the top and one at the bottom. These were then linked together by 228 vertically raise bored shafts, 1 metre in diameter and 3 metres apart. The shafts and drifts were then filled with concrete, and formed the side skeleton of the station chambers. The arch of each chamber was then constructed underground {{across the top of the}} two <b>side</b> <b>walls,</b> the <b>material</b> below the arch excavated down to the bottom of the <b>side</b> <b>walls,</b> and temporary cross struts added between the raise bored columns until the permanent elements were added.

It {{is one of the best}} examples of the international style of architecture due to its purity of form, its spatial concept and its intelligent use of structures and materials, which turned this pavilion into the quintessential piece of 20th-century architecture. In 1928 Mies was contracted to build the official German pavilion together with the Electricity Supply pavilion and several exhibits in the Official Section's buildings, with the collaboration of interior designer Lilly Reich. Rectangular in shape, it is elevated on a travertine-covered podium; the covering was supported on cross-shaped columns and load-bearing <b>walls,</b> with <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> of different <b>materials</b> (plaster-covered bricks, steel covered by green marble and Moroccan onyx). Its decoration was reduced to two ponds and a sculpture, La Mañana, by Georg Kolbe. Demolished after the Exhibition, it was reconstructed between 1985 and 1987 in its original location by Cristian Cirici, Ignasi de Solà-Morales and Fernando Ramos, following Mies van der Rohe's plans.|$|R

30|$|Besides the {{difference}} of the hanging <b>wall</b> <b>side</b> <b>materials,</b> the geometry of the subducting Pacific slab may be relevant to the spatial pattern of the seismicity. In the Miyagi-Oki region, Ito et al. (2005) {{pointed out that the}} slab abruptly changes its dip angle and further that the spatial extent of the rupture areas of the M < 8 class Miyagi-Oki earthquakes seems to be delimited by the bending points of the slab. Comparing the location of the slab bending points (at ~ 50 and ~ 110 km in Fig. 9, according to Ito et al., 2005) with the spatial pattern of the foreshock/aftershock activity of the Tohoku-Oki earthquake, it seems that the trenchward bending point delimits concentrated foreshocks. The bending of the plate boundary may cause a variation of stress around the plate boundary, and as a result seismicity variation might occur in response to that stress distribution.|$|R

The temperature profile inside the enclosure was measured by thermocouples whereas a CCD camera was employed to obtain the mean flame height of the ejected flames.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> effects on facade flames ejected from the opening (such as a window) of an under-ventilated room fire. Experiments are carried out in a reduced-scale experimental setup, consisting of a cubic fire compartment having an opening with a vertical facade <b>wall</b> and two <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> normal to the façade wall. By changing the distance of the two <b>side</b> <b>walls,</b> the facade flame heights for different opening conditions (width, height) are recorded by a CCD camera. It is found that as the distance of the two <b>side</b> <b>walls</b> decreases the behavior the flame height can be distinguished into two regimes characterized by the dimensionless excess heat release rate, skew 5 dotQ_ex^ast See Formula in PDF, outside the opening: (a) for the “wall fire” (skew 5 dotQ_ex^ast See Formula in PDF ≤ 1. 3), the flame height is shown to change little with decrease of <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> distance as the dominant entrainment is from the front direction (normal to the facade wall) independent of the <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> distances; (b) for the “axis-symmetrical fire” (5 dotQ_ex^ast > 1. 3), the flame height increases significantly with a decrease in <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> distance as both the entrainment from the two side directions (parallel to the facade wall) and that from the front direction (normal to the facade wall) together apply. A global physically based non-dimensional factor K is then brought forward based on the <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> constraint effect on the facade flame entrainment to characterize the <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> effect on the flame height, by accounting for the dimensionless excess heat release rate, the characteristic length scales of the opening as well as the <b>side</b> <b>wall</b> separation distance.
