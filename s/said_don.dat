500|$|On June 16, 2009, a woman {{claimed to}} have {{suffered}} a head injury from riding Son of Beast during her visit to the park on May 31, 2009. She did not report the incident to Kings Island officials prior to June 16. She {{claimed to have}} suffered from a burst blood vessel in her brain, after riding Son of Beast, that required admission to an intensive care unit at a nearby hospital. [...] "The first we heard of this was on June 16. Her visit was on May 31 and there's no record of going to first aid for anything here at the park," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Don</b> Helbig, public relations manager for Kings Island. Helbig {{also pointed out that}} there were no other reports of injuries on the ride that year. The Son of Beast was shut down as a precaution, however, during the investigation. [...] "At this point it would be inappropriate to speculate on an exact date when the ride may reopen. We're going to do a thorough maintenance review. We're going to work with the state of Ohio on that," [...] said Helbig.|$|E

5000|$|Cedric Adams was {{the first}} expert brought in. [...] "Adams thought the best {{possible}} way to show just how lethal Riggs really is — is to show his mastery of a form of martial arts never before seen onscreen," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Donner.</b> Adams taught the actors the movements of Capoeira. A second technical advisor, Dennis Newsome, brought jailhouse rock to the fight sequence. The third technical advisor was Rorion Gracie, who specialized in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.|$|R

6000|$|Ferris {{laughed at}} her with a sort of affectionate disrespect, and <b>said</b> good-by. <b>Don</b> Ippolito lingered for a while to talk over the {{proposed}} lessons, and then went, after more elaborate adieux. Mrs. Vervain remained thoughtful a moment before she said:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Delightfully to myself, senor," [...] <b>said</b> the <b>Don,</b> who, enraged {{at being}} interrupted, if not discovered, was as {{ready to fight}} as Cary, but disliked, of course, an {{explosion}} {{as much as he}} did; [...] "and to others, I doubt not." ...|$|R

2500|$|Filming {{the role}} for Empire lasted three weeks. The actor {{was pleased with}} the costume and used it to convey the character's menace. Bulloch based his {{performance}} on Clint Eastwood's portrayal of the Man with No Name in A Fistful of Dollars; similar to the Western character, Bulloch cradled the gun prop, made the character seem ready to shoot, slightly tilted his head, and stood a particular way. Bulloch did not try to construct a backstory for the character, and said later that [...] "the less you do with Boba Fett, the stronger he becomes". Playing Fett in Empire was both the smallest and most physically uncomfortable role Bulloch has played; Bulloch <b>said</b> <b>donning</b> the heavy jetpack was the worst aspect of the role.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, {{that was}} kind of Mr. Ferris," [...] said Mrs. Vervain. [...] "It was {{thoroughly}} thoughtful and considerate--what I call an instance of true delicacy. I'm really quite curious to see him. Don Ippolito! How very odd to call a priest Don! I should have <b>said</b> Padre. <b>Don</b> always makes you think of a Spanish cavalier.
