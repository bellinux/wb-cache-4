With this purpose, a total of 450 10 -day-old birds were allocated to 15 cages (30 birds/cage) and received three dietary treatments: a Control diet (C) and two diets (H 1 and H 2) corresponding to 10 % and 15 % H inclusion levels, respectively (H substituted 28. 4 % <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> oil and 16. 1 % <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> <b>meal</b> for H 1, and 100 % <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> oil and 24. 8 % <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> <b>meal</b> for H 2, respectively). At 28 days of age, quails were slaughtered, carcasses were weighed, breast muscles were then excised from 50 quails/treatment, weighed, and ultimate pH (pHu) and L*, a*, b* colour values were measured. Breast muscles were then cooked to assess cooking loss and meat toughness. For the digestibility trial, a total of 15 28 -day-old quails {{were assigned to the}} three feeding groups. The excreta samples were subjected to chemical and microbiological analysis. The same 15 quails were then simultaneously provided with C and H 2 diets for a 10 -day feed choice trial. Productive performance, mortality and carcass traits were in line with commercial standards and similar in all experimental groups. With the exception of ether extract digestibility, which was lower in H 1 group compared with C and H 2 (P= 0. 0001), apparent digestibility of dry matter, CP, starch and energy did not differ among treatments. Microbial composition of excreta was also comparable among the three groups. Feed choice trial showed that quails did not express a preference toward C or H 2 diets.

There were 2 dietary treatments: yellow lupin (cv.

Twenty-four mature autumn-calving dairy cows were used. During the covariate period, feed intakes and milk yields were recorded whilst cows were offered ryegrass silage ad libitum plus 6 kg d- 1 of a standard dairy concentrate. Cows were allocated to treatment and adapted to their respective diet over 7 days, during which the concentrate offered was increased up to 9 kg d- 1. During the measurement period, cows received ryegrass silage ad libitum using individual feeders. Concentrates of each treatment (9 kg d- 1) were fed 3 times d- 1. Milk yields were measured and 50 ml sub-samples of milk from two consecutive milkings were collected from all cows every week for measurement of fat, protein, lactose and somatic cell counts. Dairy cows offered the <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> <b>meal</b> concentrate had a higher DM intake, and therefore, ME intake than cows offered the lupin dietary treatment {{but there was no}} difference in the N intake by cows on the two treatment diets. As animals on both dietary treatments consumed the same (9 kg) amount of concentrates each day, the intake data showed that dairy cows offered concentrates containing <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> <b>meal</b> consumed more ryegrass silage than those offered concentrates containing yellow lupins.

From 51 to 61 days of age (phase II), all pigs were fed a common commercial diet in mash form. The following pre-planned orthogonal contrasts were conducted: (1) R-SBM v. all the other diets, (2) SPC v. all the HP-SBM diets, (3) micronized HP-SBM v. ground HP-SBM, (4) HP-SBM of ARG origin v. HP-SBM of US origin and (5) interaction between source {{and the degree of}} grinding of the HP-SBM. Dietary treatment did not affect growth performance of the pigs at any age but from 30 to 51 days of age, post weaning diarrhoea (PWD) was higher (P< 0. 001) and the TTAD and AID of all nutrients were lower for pigs fed the R-SBM diet than for pigs fed the HP-SBM or the SPC diets. However, no differences between the HP-SBM and the SPC containing diets were detected for any trait. The TTAD of organic matter (P= 0. 07) and gross energy (GE) (P= 0. 05) tended to be higher for the micronized HP-SBM than for the ground HP-SBM and that of GE was higher (P< 0. 05) for US meal than for the ARG meal. Pigs fed R-SBM had lower villus height (P< 0. 01) than pigs fed HP-SBM or SPC but no differences in ileal mucosal morphology were detected between SPC and HP-SBM containing diets. It is concluded that feeding the HP-SBM or SPC-reduced PWD and improved nutrient digestibility and ileal morphology as compared with feeding the R-SBM, but had no effect on pig performance. The {{inclusion in the}} diet of added value soya products (micronized SBM or SPC) in substitution of the R-SBM increased the TTAD of all nutrients and reduced PWD but had no advantage in terms of growth performance over the use of ground HP-SBM...|$|R

Experiment 1 evaluated six faba bean and seven pea cultivars and Experiment 2 evaluated two faba bean and three pea cultivars as well as a sample of <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> <b>meal</b> provided as a reference material. Peas and beans were added at 750 g/kg as the only source of protein/amino acids in a semi-synthetic diet containing the inert marker titanium dioxide; SBM was added, in a control diet, at 500 g/kg. Each diet was fed to six replicates of a cage containing two Ross-type broilers for 96 h at which point birds were culled allowing removal of ileal digesta. Chemical analyses allowed the calculation of the coefficient of SID of amino acids. There were no differences between samples of the same pulse species (P> 0. 05) but peas had higher values (P< 0. 05), similar to SBM, than beans. Trypsin inhibitor content (expressed as g trypsin inhibitor units/mg sample) of all pea samples was low and in the range 0. 83 – 1. 77 mg/kg. There was relatively little variation in bean tannin content and composition amongst the coloured-flowered varieties; however, the white-flowered cultivar had no tannins. There was no correlation between tannin content and coefficient of SID. The content of SID of amino acids (g/kg legume) was higher in SBM when compared with peas and beans by virtue of having higher total concentrations...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} {{characteristics of}} mixtures of <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> extrusion process with wheat and corn and soya beans’ meals with these cereals. On the Polish market, soybeans come mostly from traditional crops, {{for this reason}} its cultivation is much more expensive than soybeans derived from GM crops.

40|$|Rearing {{of organic}} dairy bull calves can be contradictory, using calves {{with a high}} need for quality protein {{at the same time}} as a high intake of forage (> 60 % up to 6 months of age) is required. Forage legumes contain more crude protein than grass, but with high rumen {{degradability}} of the protein. When legume forage is fed together with energy-rich cold-pressed rapeseed cake (CRC) the protein in the feeds can be utilized to a higher extent and a satisfactory calf weight gain can be achieved as shown. Using locally produced protein feeds instead of the often used <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> <b>meal</b> (SBM) is of great interest not only in organic but also in conventional feeding because of environmentally advantages...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the effect of feeding graded levels of poultry litter on the physiological characteristics of rabbits. The litter was heat treated by deep stacking at a temperature range of 40. 10 - 55 °C (104. 20 - 131 °F) for 21 days. This was done to ensure pathogenic microbial safety when used as animal feed supplement. A twelve week feeding trial was conducted using 24 (2 - 3 months-old) Chinchilla rabbits to asses the effect of substituting Poultry Litter (PL) for <b>Soya</b> <b>Bean</b> <b>Meal</b> (SBM) on cortisol, total protein, cholesterol and enzyme serology of the rabbits. <b>Soya</b> <b>bean</b> <b>meal</b> in the diets was replaced with poultry litter at 0 % (Diet A-Control), 5 % (Diet B), 10 % (Diet C) and 15 % (Diet D). The rabbits were divided into four groups with each group assigned to one of the four dietary treatments in a Completely Randomized Block Design (CRBD). Each treatment was replicated three times. At the end of the feeding trial, blood samples were collected from three rabbits from each treatment group for cortisol, total protein, cholesterol and enzymological analysis. Results obtained showed that the inclusion of poultry litter had no significant (p> 0. 5) effect on cortisol, total protein, cholesterol and enzymes (Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase (SGOT), Serum Glutamic Pyruvic Transaminase (SGPT) and Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP). However, the rabbits on Diet A (0 % PL) and Diet B (5 % PL) gave better values numerically in cortisol and chemical components. This study justifies the practical possibility of having poultry litter as dietary protein source for animals using rabbits as a model and also provides an environmentally and economically friendly way of disposing this pollutant...|$|R

40|$|Two {{trials were}} {{conducted}} to study pea protein concentrate (PPC) as a substitute of <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> <b>meal</b> (SBM), <b>soya</b> protein concentrate (SPC) or fullfat <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> (FFSB) in the diet on equivalent protein basis, on productive performance and digestive traits of piglets. The design was completely randomised with 4 treatments and 5 (six piglets; trial 1) or 6 (one piglet; trial 2) pens per treatment. In trial 1 growth traits from 26 to 48  days of age and the coefficient of total tract apparent digestibility (CTTAD) of dietary components at 36 and 48  days of age were assessed. In trial 2 the coefficient of ileal apparent digestibility (CIAD) of dietary components, the pH of the gastro intestinal tract (GIT) {{and the weight of}} digestive organs and spleen were measured at 48  days of age. From 26 to 36  days of age pigs fed SBM and SPC grew faster and were more efficient than pigs fed PPC (P < 0. 01) with pigs fed FFSB being intermediate. From 37 to 48  days of age pigs fed SPC or SBM ate more feed than pigs fed FFSB (P < 0. 05) with pigs fed PPC being intermediate. For the entire experiment (26 to 48  days of age) pigs fed SPC and SBM tended to have higher average daily gain and feed intake than pigs fed PPC or FFSB (P < 0. 10). Pigs fed SBM and SPC tended to have higher CTTAD of crude protein (P < 0. 10) and had higher CIAD of organic matter and gross energy (P < 0. 01) than pigs fed PPC and FFSB. The weight of the GIT was greater for pigs fed FFSB and PPC than for pigs fed SBM (P < 0. 05) with pigs fed SPC being intermediate. In summary, the inclusion of pea protein concentrate and fullfat <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> in the diet reduces pig performance from 26 to 36  days of age. In addition, these two protein sources impair ileal digestibility of organic matter and gross energy at 48  days of age. On the other hand, growth performance was similar for pigs fed the <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> <b>meal</b> and <b>soya</b> protein concentrate diets. © 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.
