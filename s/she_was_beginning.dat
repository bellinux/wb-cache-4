Reportedly, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> to become disenchanted with WWE, {{who began to}} focus on looks rather than wrestling ability.

A member of the Legion of Mary, Garza took her Catholic faith seriously. In her letter, she indicated that was finding comfort in attending Mass and Communion every day.|$|E
500|$|At {{the motel}} room, Selena and Saldívar began arguing. Motel guests complained about loud noises coming from Saldívar's room. They said they heard two women arguing about {{business}} matters. Selena told Saldívar {{she could no}} longer be trusted, and demanded Saldívar return her financial papers. Selena then dumped Saldívar's satchel containing bank statements onto the bed and saw the gun. At 11:48a.m. (CST), Saldívar pointed it at Selena. As Selena tried to flee, Saldívar shot her once on the lower right shoulder, severing an artery and causing a massive loss of blood. Trinidad Espinoza, the hotel's maintenance man, reported hearing a [...] "loud bang", which he likened to a car engine misfiring. Selena was critically wounded; she ran towards the lobby, leaving a trail of blood [...] long. She was seen clutching her chest screaming, [...] "Help me! Help me! I've been shot!"; Saldívar was still chasing after her, pointing the gun at her, and calling her a [...] "bitch". According to Carlos Morales, who was waiting outside the motel, he heard screaming and saw Selena running towards him. She grabbed Morales and screamed, [...] "they'll shoot me again". Selena collapsed on the floor at 11:49a.m. (CST) as hotel general manager Barbara Schultz telephoned the emergency services. The singer identified Saldívar as her assailant and gave the number of the room where she had been shot. Shawna Vela and hotel sales manager Ruben DeLeon tried to stop the flow of blood. Selena's condition began to deteriorate rapidly as motel staff attended to her. Selena screamed at the staff, telling them, [...] "lock the door, she'll shoot me again". DeLeon tried to talk to Selena but noticed <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> to lose consciousness; he said she was moaning and moving less often. DeLeon noticed Selena's eyes had rolled back and that she went limp.|$|E

500|$|That summer, Love {{began working}} on a larger, {{commercial}} game. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> to believe that her games could be successful commercially, a belief supported by messages to that effect by fans of her previous works. The game, , was released in February 2012. Love dropped out of university during the game's development in her fourth year of an English undergraduate degree. She {{felt that she was}} [...] "not really learning a whole lot" [...] and was unable to balance school and work on the game. Set centuries after Digital: A Love Story, the plot of Analogue revolves around an unnamed investigator, who is tasked with discovering the reason for an interstellar ship's disappearance once it reappears 600 years after [...] "going dark". The game's themes focus similarly around human/computer interaction, interpersonal relationships, and LGBT issues; but focus primarily on [...] "transhumanism, traditional marriage, loneliness and cosplay." [...] The release of Analogue, Love's first commercial game as main developer, currently fully supports her financially. Although Analogue is a sequel [...] "of sorts" [...] to Digital, the time difference between the two games means that they are connected more in spirit than directly, similar to the connections between Digital and Don't take it personally. Analogue sold over 30,000 copies by August 2012, and has inspired the release of a soundtrack album by the game's composer, Isaac Schankler, as well as a commercial expansion to the game, titled Hate Plus, which is intended to further develop the backstory of *Mute and the ship. In 2016, Love released a new visual novel, Ladykiller in a Bind. She described the game as [...] "an erotic visual novel about social manipulation and girls tying up other girls".|$|E

2500|$|Burney {{was fifteen}} {{by the time}} her father {{remarried}} in 1767. Entries in her diaries suggest that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> to feel pressure {{to give up her}} writing, as something [...] "unladylike" [...] that [...] "might vex Mrs. Allen." [...] Feeling that she had transgressed what was proper, she burnt that same year her first manuscript, The History of Caroline Evelyn, which she had written in secret. Despite this repudiation of writing, Frances kept up her diaries and in them wrote an account of the emotions that led up to that dramatic act. She eventually recouped some of the effort that went into the first manuscript by using it as a foundation for her first novel, Evelina, which follows the life of the fictional Caroline Evelyn's daughter.|$|E

[...] At this time, the affairs of the Society were largely in Olcott's hands. Meetings were held irregularly, and many plans for occult experimentation were proposed. Neither Blavatsky nor Judge took any active part in the meetings after the first few sessions.

2500|$|Also {{contemporaneous}} {{with the}} writing of Caballero was {{the celebration of the}} Texas Centennial in 1936. The so-called [...] "centennial discourse" [...] ballyhooed by the media in the 1930s largely extolled the accomplishments of the state's Anglo-American population and, in the words of literary historian John Morán González, depicted Mexicans [...] "as the main obstacle to Anglo-Texan freedom in the past and as a persistent social problem for the state in the present". The [...] "racialized" [...] reconstruction of Texas history prompted the Tejano community to critique their state's marginalization of the Mexican and Mexican-American's contributions. These critiques often took the form of literature written by Mexican-Americans in which they envision [...] "a prominent and honored place in their community within the Lone Star State". Jovita González contested the dominant centennial discourse in her [...] "Catholic Heroines of Texas" [...] poster exhibit at the Texas Centennial Exposition's Catholic Exhibit, an abbreviated version of which she simultaneously published in the Southern Messenger, {{at about the same time}} <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> work on Caballero.|$|E
2500|$|Bates {{wanted to}} get back to British lines as quickly as possible, for fear that her cover would be blown. On Saturday, September 26, 1778, on her way back to New York City, [...] she was {{discovered}} at an American headquarters. The American unit had over 5,000 troops, and was under the command of General Charles Scott. General Scott was Washington's Chief of Intelligence, and was on the lookout for British counter-intelligence. Bates was detained and taken to Scott who questioned her. Bates told Scott that she [...] "was a Soldier's wife in the Centre Division & had forgot something about five or six Miles below the Plains." [...] Bates eventually was let go, but she was rattled by the occurrences, and suspicion that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> to garner. After she returned to New York City and delivered information to Major Drummond, Drummond took her to Long Island with him for fear of her running into American forces again. A few days later they returned to Manhattan and Drummond asked her to meet with a friend of Benedict Arnold's within a 47-mile radius of Philadelphia. This displays Benedict Arnold's early involvement with the Tory intelligence network.|$|E
