Cardoza-Moore led a group called Proclaiming Justice To The Nation (PJTN), which funded the lawsuit via donations. Some of the donors were called as witnesses in the hearing. One witness admitted that PJTN had paid him thousands of dollars to read to the court extracts from anti-Muslim Internet websites.|$|E

25|$|Cruzado defended MSU's {{hiring and}} {{retention}} practices. In the 2012-2013 school year, she said, MSU paid $178,000 in retention salary bonuses and paid $1.35 million to provide equipment, materials, staff, and travel. Fourteen retention packages were offered to faculty; eight stayed, one left, and five were undecided. That compared, <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>to</b> the 2008-2009 school year, {{in which only}} five faculty were offered retention packages totalling $521,000 (all five stayed). MSU also won state matching funds for all federal EPSCoR monies received, and now also offers bonuses to faculty who win research funding that adds at least 25 percent to their base salary. The university also {{increased the number of}} paid graduate assistants to 616 from 540 in the past two years, and added 12 more in the 2012-2013 school year.|$|E

500|$|Streep's mother, {{whom she}} has {{compared}} in both appearance and manner to Dame Judi Dench, strongly encouraged her daughter and instilled confidence in her from a very young age.

If you're lazy, you're not going to get it done. But if you put your mind to it, you can do anything.' And I believed her."

The Agoncillos settled in their family house in Malate. After the death of Don Felipe, Agoncillo's remaining family suffered from starvation due to their meager supply of food, water and other needs. The Japanese conquerors also contributed to their anguish during the period of the Japanese invasion. Taking this all in stride, Marcela remained pragmatic and a source of inspiration.

[...] Wadia continued: [...] "Let's just say that what happens is the complete opposite of what you want to see. Zainab and Yusef share a dark and twisted love, and she definitely has feelings for him. It's not true and pure like what she used to have with Masood - and if Yusef manages to get her back to Pakistan, it will be the end for her.

500|$|After leaving Geneva on 8 February, the Hański family {{spent several}} months visiting {{the major cities}} of Italy. In Florence the {{sculptor}} Lorenzo Bartolini started work on a bust of Hańska. In the summer of 1834 they returned to Vienna, where they would stay for another year. During this time Balzac continued writing to Hańska, and by accident two especially amorous letters fell {{into the hands of}} her husband. He wrote to the French author, furious, and demanded an explanation. Balzac wrote to Hański claiming that it {{was nothing more than a}} game: [...] "One evening, in jest, <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> me that she would like to know what a love-letter was. This was said wholly without meaning.... I wrote those two unfortunate letters to Vienna, supposing that she remembered our joke...."

A year later she started working on Ray of Light, her eighth studio album. Madonna wrote songs with William Orbit, Patrick Leonard, Rick Nowels and Babyface. The album would reflect the singer's changed perspectives about life. Author Carol Benson noted that it was a [...] "deeply spiritual dance record", with the crux of it based on Madonna's career, her journey and the many identities she had assumed over the years. Motherhood had softened the singer emotionally, which was reflected in the songs. She started talking about ideas and used words which implied deep and personal thoughts, rather than the regular dance-floor anthemic tunes she had composed. The singer began introspecting herself with motherhood being a [...] "big catalyst for me.

They lived there for two winters in what became a six-year relationship. She recalled, [...] "It was cold, isolated, romantic and so intense—quite special." [...] In 1995, Waters was at Queen Mary and Westfield College writing her PhD {{dissertation}} on gay and lesbian historical fiction from 1870 onward when she became interested in the Victorian era. While learning about the activism in socialism, women's suffrage, and utopianism of the period, she was inspired to write a work of fiction of the kind that she would like to read. Specifically, Waters intended to write a story that focused on an urban setting, diverging from previous lesbian-themed books such as Isabel Miller's Patience and Sarah, in which two women escape an oppressive home life to live together freely in the woods. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> herself at the time, [...] "there's so much more to lesbian history than that".|$|E

500|$|... "Nothing Really Matters" [...] {{was written}} by Madonna and American {{producer}} and songwriter Patrick Leonard, and was produced by herself alongside British producers William Orbit and Marius De Vries.

It took me on a search for answers to questions I'd never asked myself before," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> Q magazine in 2002. Madonna begun writing the song with Leonard during developing her album Ray of Light. However, unlike their previous work dynamics, Leonard gave little input during studio sessions and only co-wrote four songs for the album, including [...] "Nothing Really Matters". As a result, Madonna did not want him to produce the track. Her manager Guy Oseary then telephoned Orbit, and suggested that the latter send some songs to Madonna. Orbit sent a 13-track digital audio tape (DAT) to her, which included a demo version of [...] "Nothing Really Matters"'s music.
