5|$|Even {{with the}} data {{provided}} by the Voyagers, Titan remained a body of mystery—a large satellite <b>shrouded</b> in an atmosphere that makes detailed observation difficult. The mystery that had surrounded Titan since the 17th-century observations of Christiaan Huygens and Giovanni Cassini was revealed by a spacecraft named in their honor.|$|E
5|$|From the 1888 harvest, Monet {{produced}} three canvases featuring two stacks each (Wildenstein #'s 1213-5) {{against the}} backdrop of hills along the left bank of the Seine and a few Giverny houses to the right. Then, he turned to his left to capture two scenes (1216-7) in which the hills are <b>shrouded</b> by a line of poplars.|$|E
5|$|His tent {{is portrayed}} as a less dark place than the {{emptiness}} outside, and becomes a place of safety and sanctuary. Conversely, the swamp is described in themes that convey it as <b>shrouded</b> in mist at night, and a place Nick deliberately tries not to think about. When he wakes in the morning, regenerated by sleep, he feels stronger and the swamp seems less threatening.|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} {{rotor assembly}} <b>shroud</b> includes {{at least one}} reinforcing flange on the upper surface of the <b>shroud.</b> The strength provided by the reinforcing flange allows for a smaller <b>shroud</b> thickness resulting in a net reduction of <b>shroud</b> mass. The lower <b>shroud</b> mass reduces the centrifugal stress on the rotor assembly blade during operation. The strength provided by the reinforcing flanges also significantly reduces the centrifugal bending stress on the <b>shroud</b> during operation. The <b>shroud</b> mass may be further reduced by tapering the <b>shroud</b> {{leading and trailing edges}} or, for <b>shrouds</b> incorporating a damper, by providing a damper cavity with a lower diameter surface defining an opening therethrough...|$|R
50|$|In 1990, Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) was {{discovered}} in core <b>shrouds,</b> resulting in a heightened awareness of core <b>shroud</b> maintenance.

5|$|After {{returning}} from exile, Æthelbald of Mercia succeeded Coelred and afterwards endowed {{the church at}} Crowland. Ælfwald's friendly stance towards Æthelbald helped to maintain peaceful relations with his more powerful neighbour. The Life of Guthlac, which includes information about Æthelbald during his period of exile at Crowland, is dedicated to Ælfwald. Later versions of the Life reveal the high quality of written Old English produced in East Anglia during Ælfwald's reign. He was a literate and devoutly Christian king: his letter written to Boniface in around 747 reveals his diplomatic skills and gives a rare glimpse {{into the life of}} a ruler who is otherwise <b>shrouded</b> in obscurity.|$|E
5|$|After {{the failure}} and {{disappearance}} of the Hospitallers, {{the history of the}} region is <b>shrouded</b> in obscurity for decades. But the trend toward the unification of the Romanian polities seems to begin with Voivode Litovoi. He (or his namesake son) was at war with the Hungarians and killed in battle sometime between 1270 and 1280. In the battle, his brother, Bărbat was captured. Bărbat was forced not only to pay ransom but also to recognize Hungarian rule.|$|E
50|$|In {{the mid-nineteenth}} century the futtock band was introduced, being a metal collar fitted to the mast below the top, to which the lower point of the futtock <b>shrouds</b> is {{attached}}. Before this the futtock <b>shrouds</b> were attached to the lower <b>shrouds</b> that rose directly to the top. In this arrangement lower <b>shrouds</b> must support a greater load, requiring the use of catharpins to provide bracing between port and starboard <b>shrouds.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the most}} {{traditional}} ships, the futtock <b>shrouds</b> {{can be used}} {{to gain access to the}} tops. Sailors ascend ratlines on the ordinary <b>shrouds</b> until nearly at the top, then transfer to the futtock <b>shrouds</b> which will be reaching upwards and outwards above them. Using the futtock <b>shrouds</b> involves climbing the underside of an overhanging rope at about 45 degrees. Futtock <b>shrouds</b> may or may not have ratlines.|$|R
40|$|A {{double-ended}} {{arc discharge}} lamp includes a sealed, light-transmissive outer jacket, a light-transmissive <b>shroud</b> mounted within the outer jacket and directly {{supported by the}} outer jacket, and an arc discharge tube mounted within the <b>shroud.</b> The arc tube is typically a metal halide arc discharge tube. In a preferred embodiment, the <b>shroud</b> includes an outwardly flared portion at each end. The outwardly flared portions space the <b>shroud</b> from the outer jacket and support the <b>shroud</b> within the outer jacket. The outwardly flared portions of the <b>shroud</b> can be affixed to the outer jacket by fusing. The outer jacket can be provided with inwardly extending dimples for locating the <b>shroud</b> {{with respect to the}} outer jacket.

5|$|Booth's {{body was}} <b>shrouded</b> {{in a blanket}} and tied {{to the side of}} an old farm wagon for the trip back to Belle Plain. There, his corpse was taken aboard the ironclad USS Montauk and brought to the Washington Navy Yard for {{identification}} and an autopsy. The body was identified there as Booth's by more than ten people who knew him. Among the identifying features used {{to make sure that the}} man that was killed was Booth was a tattoo on his left hand with his initials J.W.B., and a distinct scar on the back of his neck.|$|E
5|$|Many fans of {{the show}} were outraged when Mercedes was {{supposedly}} murdered by Freddie Roscoe in November 2014, just a week after her sister Carmel died in a train crash. However, Jennifer Metcalfe stated that: 'Mercedes's departure is totally <b>shrouded</b> in mystery. Running up to the week where she exits, she has really annoyed pretty much everyone in the village, so it's 'who's done it?'. The story line was billed as a complete mystery, as the viewers don't completely know what happened between Mercedes and her killer on {{the night at the}} McQueen house, or whether or not she was actually dead.|$|E
5|$|Members of Howling Bells {{have cited}} The Beatles, Charles Mingus, Peter Green, Vinnie Colaiuta, and Jimi Hendrix as influences. The {{catalyst}} for the change from Waikiki to Howling Bells was Juanita and Joel's trip to see Black Rebel Motorcycle Club in Australia. They saw this band <b>shrouded</b> in red lights, and it created an atmosphere that inspired them to alter their musical direction. The band's style {{has been compared to}} that of Siouxsie and the Banshees, PJ Harvey, The Velvet Underground, Nick Cave, Mazzy Star, and The Duke Spirit. Their music has been called folk rock, melodic blues, and country-goth. Juanita disagrees with the group's gothic characterization.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} two-dimensional thrust augmenting ejector flows has been conducted. Measurements of the <b>shroud</b> surface pressure distribution, mean velocity, turbulent intensities and Reynolds stresses {{were made in}} two <b>shroud</b> geometries at various primary nozzle pressure ratios. The effects of <b>shroud</b> geometry and primary nozzle pressure ratio on the <b>shroud</b> surface pressure distribution, mean flow field and turbulent field were determined. From these measurements the evolution of mixing within the <b>shroud</b> of the primary flow and entrained fluid was obtained. The relationship between the mean flow field, the turbulent field and the <b>shroud</b> surface pressure distribution is discussed...|$|R
50|$|<b>Shrouds</b> are {{attached}} symmetrically {{on both the}} port and starboard sides. For those <b>shrouds</b> which attach high up the mast, a structure projecting from the mast must be used to increase {{the angle of the}} <b>shroud</b> at the attachment point, providing more support to the mast. On most sailing boats, such structures are called spreaders, and the <b>shrouds</b> they hold continue down to the deck. On large sailing ships, however, particularly square-riggers, the <b>shrouds</b> end at the projections (called tops or crosstrees) and their loads are carried into the mast slightly further down by futtock <b>shrouds.</b>|$|R
50|$|Zugibe is {{well known}} for his {{research}} into crucifixion and the <b>Shroud</b> of Turin, which modifies the theories of Pierre Barbet regarding crucifixion, and the Catholic Church regarding the <b>Shroud</b> of Turin. He made numerous television appearances on these subjects, including How Jesus Died - the Final 18 Hours (Learning Channel and History Channel), The <b>Shroud</b> of Turin (CBC), Jesus, the Man (Discovery Channel), Son of God (BBC), Stigmata and the <b>Shroud</b> (In Search Of), The Stigmata (Learning Channel), The <b>Shroud</b> of Turin (60 Minutes, Australia), DaVinci and the <b>Shroud</b> (National Geographic), The Mystery of Jesus (CNN) and The Naked Archaeologist.|$|R
5|$|Russell {{was married}} to his college {{sweetheart}} Rose Swisher from 1956 to 1973. They had three children, namely daughter Karen Russell, the television pundit and lawyer, and sons William Jr. and Jacob. However, the couple grew emotionally distant and divorced. In 1977, he married Dorothy Anstett, Miss USA of 1968, but they divorced in 1980. The relationship was <b>shrouded</b> in controversy because Anstett was white. In 1996, Russell married his third wife, Marilyn Nault; their marriage lasted until her death in January 2009. He has been a resident of Mercer Island, Washington for over four decades. His older brother was the noted playwright Charlie L. Russell.|$|E
5|$|The 7th Infantry Division was {{selected}} to undertake the task of recapturing Attu Island. The division arrived at Cold Bay on April 30, 1943, and, despite the cold weather prevailing in the region, many of the American troops were wearing only regular field clothing as the division had previously been stationed in California. Due to poor weather, the Americans' assault on Attu was delayed twice – first to May 4 and then to May 11. When the operation commenced on May 11, heavy fog <b>shrouded</b> the recapturing force from the Japanese, which hampered the latter's attempts at defending the island.|$|E
5|$|The Wailers were {{scheduled}} to open 17 shows in the US for Sly and the Family Stone. After four shows, the band was fired because they were more popular than the acts they were opening for. The Wailers disbanded in 1974, {{with each of the}} three main members pursuing a solo career. The reason for the breakup is <b>shrouded</b> in conjecture; some believe that there were disagreements amongst Bunny Wailer, Peter Tosh, and Marley concerning performances, while others claim that Wailer and Tosh simply preferred solo work.|$|E

25|$|The {{details of}} {{the image on the}} <b>shroud</b> are not easily seen with the naked eye, but they can be more clearly {{revealed}} through photography. In May 1898 Italian photographer Secondo Pia was allowed to photograph the <b>shroud.</b> He took the first photograph of the <b>shroud</b> on 28 May 1898. Pia was startled by the visible image of the negative plate, implying that the <b>shroud</b> is effectively a negative of some kind. Pia was at first accused of doctoring his photographs, but he was vindicated in 1931 when another photographer, Giuseppe Enrie, photographed the <b>shroud</b> and obtained results similar to Pia's. In 1978, ultraviolet photographs were taken of the <b>shroud.</b>|$|R

5|$|Tina (McShera) {{arrives at}} a Victorian villa for a séance. Hives (Shearsmith) settles Tina before {{retrieving}} Talbot (Steadman), who arrives <b>shrouded</b> in black and carrying a doll. Talbot, an elderly woman with heavy cataracts, speaks in a high-pitched voice, unnerving Tina. When the séance begins, objects fly around the room, Talbot's voice becomes demonic and ectoplasm seeps from her mouth. Hives encourages Tina not to break the circle, but she does so when a blue-faced demon (Starkey) appears behind her. She is terrified until Hives reveals himself to be Terry, {{the host of a}} hidden camera programme called Scaredy Cam.|$|E
5|$|After the February 1917 {{revolution}} that toppled the Tsarist government, Mikoyan and other Bolsheviks fought against anti-Bolshevik {{elements in the}} Caucasus. Mikoyan became a commissar in the newly formed Red Army and continued to fight in Baku against anti-Bolshevik forces. He {{was wounded in the}} fighting and was noted for saving the life of fellow Party-member Sergo Ordzhonikidze. Afterwards, he continued his Party work, becoming one of the co-founders of the Baku Soviet, which lasted until 1918, when he and twenty-five other commissars fled Baku and were captured by the Transcaspian Government. Known as the Baku 26, all the commissars were executed with the sole exception of Mikoyan; the circumstances of his survival are <b>shrouded</b> in mystery. In February 1919 Mikoyan returned to Baku and resumed his activities there, helping to establish the Baku Bureau of the Caucasus Regional Committee (Kraikom).|$|E
50|$|Usually a <b>shroud</b> will connect {{at the top}} of the mast, and {{additional}} <b>shrouds</b> might connect partway down the mast, depending on the design of the boat. <b>Shrouds</b> terminate at their bottom ends at the chain plates, which are tied into the hull.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of the {{presence}} of unheated and heated <b>shrouds</b> on the thermal performance of longitudinal finned heat sinks. A comprehensive numerical study was conducted to determine the impact of the <b>shroud</b> clearance from the tip of the fins and <b>shroud</b> heating. The first part of the study deals with {{the effects of}} an unheated <b>shroud</b> on finned heat sinks of different fin height, fin pitch and length in an attempt to cover a wide range of geometry. The numerical results reveal an optimum clearance for maximum heat transfer. For all heat sinks studied the unheated <b>shroud</b> improved the performance by as much as 15 % until the <b>shroud</b> was very close when the performance decreased by as much as 10 %. In {{the second part of the}} paper, the effects of heating of the <b>shroud</b> were considered. In these numerical runs, an isothermal boundary condition was imposed on the <b>shroud.</b> For the heating levels considered, it was found that heating of the <b>shrouds</b> can increase or lower the thermal performance of the heat sink depending on the heat sink geometry and <b>shroud</b> clearance. Finally, the numerical results also revealed a systematic dependence of the normalized Nusselt number on the Rayleigh number for a given heat sink geometry...|$|R
5|$|Devil Daggers is a first-person shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} indie development team Sorath. Players are tasked with surviving {{for as long as}} possible against swarms of demonic enemies on an arena <b>shrouded</b> in darkness. The player character can fire daggers from their fingers to eliminate foes and move about to avoid contact with them. The player dies upon touching an enemy, and as time passes, more threatening creatures begin to appear. Survival times are recorded on a global leaderboard where replays of playthroughs can be accessed and viewed. The deliberate use of unfiltered textures and effects like polygon jitter and texture warping make its visual style reminiscent of early 3D games released in the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Her {{story is}} a {{reminder}} that the universal denigration of a group, based on the behaviour of a few, cannot cloud the greatness of the individual. Mandodari defies the stereotype of this racism. She is simple, unswerving, and self-effacing, driven by the light of knowledge which gives meaning to solid materialism in an age that is <b>shrouded</b> by impulse, passion, and desire. She is the instrument that awakens the mind and counsels reason when irrationality becomes the core being. That she goes unheard and unheeded does not change her path. To her, the dharmic part is inward-looking, while the role of the dutiful wife is the external self. Mandodari thought that her duty to her husband on issues of morals and values ended with her telling him what she thought of his actions. She neither put up any brave fight to stop him nor considered it her duty to do so.|$|E
