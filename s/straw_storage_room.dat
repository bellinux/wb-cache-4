40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{establish}} the <b>storage</b> <b>room</b> of agricultural products cooled by snow. The changes of physical properties and nutrition ingredient of stored vegetables in each <b>storage</b> <b>room</b> were compared after Chinese cabbages, cabbages, Japanese radishes, carrots, tomatoes, and spinets were stored in the <b>storage</b> <b>room</b> of cooled by snow or the electric refrigerator. Significant differences in moisture and temperature between the two storage systems were not observed. The hardness of cabbages and Japanese radish among examined vegetables tended to be held in the <b>storage</b> <b>room</b> cooled by snow. The decrease of the moisture level of Japanese cabbages, cabbages and carrot was slightly inhibited in the <b>storage</b> <b>room</b> of cooled by snow. The vitamin C level of Japanese radishes and tomatoes tended to be held in the <b>storage</b> <b>room</b> cooled by snow compared to the electric refrigerator. The sugar levels of Japanese cabbages, cabbages, and Japanese radishes was same in the two storage systems. Lycopene and β- carotene levels were higher in tomatoes stored in the <b>storage</b> <b>room</b> of cooled by snow than in those stored in electric refrigerator, however, β- carotene level of carrots stored in the <b>storage</b> <b>room</b> cooled by snow was lower than that stored in the electric refrigerator. Thus, the uncommon problem was not observed in storage of vegetables using the <b>storage</b> <b>room</b> cooled by snow, although the changes of physical properties and nutrition ingredient in vegetables stored in each storage systems were slightly different. Therefore, the <b>storage</b> <b>room</b> of agricultural products cooled by snow may be available in an area of high snowfall...|$|R
50|$|The museum also {{includes}} a Print/Drawing Study and <b>Storage</b> <b>room</b> along with a Painting/Sculpture Study and <b>Storage</b> <b>room.</b> These spaces can service for the studio classes and provide students with hands on research in preservation and restoration of works of art.|$|R
50|$|Specimens {{are stored}} in {{environmentally}} controlled <b>storage</b> <b>rooms</b> away from direct sunlight with limited exposure to other light sources to minimize causes of deterioration. <b>Storage</b> <b>rooms</b> are kept at a relative humidity (RH) level of between 45% and 55%. Temperature levels are kept between 18°C and 22°C. Store rooms are never completely immune to pests. Pest infestations are reduced by the regular vacuuming of storage areas and not allowing any food or drink in the <b>storage</b> <b>rooms.</b>|$|R
