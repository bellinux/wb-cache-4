25|$|There are {{two main}} types of wrap - <b>stretchy</b> and woven. <b>Stretchy</b> wraps are {{generally}} made of knits such as jersey or interlock. It is easy to take babies {{in and out of}} a <b>stretchy</b> wrap. This can be easier for the wearer as the sling often remains tied on and the baby is lifted out and put back in as required. Several factors influence stretchiness: carriers with any spandex or lycra content will tend to be very <b>stretchy,</b> carriers which are 100% cotton or other natural fibers will tend to have less lengthwise stretch.|$|E

2500|$|A special {{characteristic}} of slacklining is {{the ease with}} which the dynamics of the practice can be altered. Using narrow (...) webbing will result in a <b>stretchier</b> slackline. This allows for more sway in the line and can make a short line feel substantially longer. Wider webbing (...) is much more rigid, often creating a bouncier slackline optimal for aerial tricks. The tension of the line will also increase or decrease the sway of the line. Weight due to the different methods of tensioning will also vary the performance of a slackline. A comealong and a ratchet will both add enough weight to allow the feedback from quick movements on shorter slacklines to be felt.|$|R
2500|$|Pure {{polystyrene}} is brittle, {{but hard}} enough that a fairly high-performance product {{can be made}} by giving it some of the properties of a <b>stretchier</b> material, such as polybutadiene rubber. The two such materials can never normally be mixed because of the small mixing entropy of polymers (see Flory-Huggins solution theory), but if polybutadiene is added during polymerisation it can become chemically bonded to the polystyrene, forming a graft copolymer, which helps to incorporate normal polybutadiene into the final mix, resulting in high-impact polystyrene or HIPS, often called [...] "high-impact plastic" [...] in advertisements. One commercial name for HIPS is Bextrene. Common applications of HIPS include toys and product casings. HIPS is usually injection molded in production. Autoclaving polystyrene can compress and harden the material.|$|R
5000|$|Bias tape or {{bias binding}} is a {{narrow strip of}} fabric, cut on the bias. The strip's fibers, being at 45 degrees {{to the length of}} the strip, makes it <b>stretchier</b> as well as more fluid and more drapeable {{compared}} to a strip that is cut on the grain. Many strips can be pieced together into a long [...] "tape." [...] The tape's width varies from about 1/2" [...] to about 3" [...] depending on applications. Bias tape is used in making piping, binding seams, finishing raw edges, etc. It is often used on the edges of quilts, placemats, and bibs, around armhole and neckline edges instead of a facing, and as a simple strap or tie for casual bags or clothing.|$|R

25|$|Many puzzles {{in these}} games involve {{gathering}} and using items from their inventory. Players must apply lateral thinking techniques where they apply real-world extrinsic knowledge about objects in unexpected ways. For example, {{by putting a}} deflated inner tube on a cactus to create a slingshot, which requires a player to realize that an inner tube is <b>stretchy.</b> They may need to carry items in their inventory for a long duration before they prove useful, and thus it is normal for adventure games to test a player's memory where a challenge can only be overcome by recalling a piece of information from earlier in the game. There is seldom any time pressure for these puzzles, focusing more on the player's ability to reason than on quick-thinking.|$|E
25|$|The {{properties}} of a polyurethane are {{greatly influenced by}} the types of isocyanates and polyols used to make it. Long, flexible segments, contributed by the polyol, give soft, elastic polymer. High amounts of crosslinking give tough or rigid polymers. Long chains and low crosslinking give a polymer that is very <b>stretchy,</b> short chains with lots of crosslinks produce a hard polymer while long chains and intermediate crosslinking give a polymer useful for making foam. The crosslinking present in polyurethanes means that the polymer consists of a three-dimensional network and molecular weight is very high. In some respects a piece of polyurethane {{can be regarded as}} one giant molecule. One consequence of this is that typical polyurethanes do not soften or melt when they are heated; they are thermosetting polymers. The choices available for the isocyanates and polyols, in addition to other additives and processing conditions allow polyurethanes to have the very wide range of properties that make them such widely used polymers.|$|E

2500|$|Cotton {{is used to}} make {{a number}} of textile products. These include terrycloth for highly {{absorbent}} bath towels and robes; denim for blue jeans; cambric, popularly used in the manufacture of blue work shirts (from which we get the term [...] "blue-collar"); and corduroy, seersucker, and cotton twill. Socks, underwear, and most T-shirts are made from cotton. Bed sheets often are made from cotton. Cotton also is used to make yarn used in crochet and knitting. Fabric also can be made from recycled or recovered cotton that otherwise would be thrown away during the spinning, weaving, or cutting process. While many fabrics are made completely of cotton, some materials blend cotton with other fibers, including rayon and synthetic fibers such as polyester. It can either be used in knitted or woven fabrics, as it can be blended with elastine to make a <b>stretchier</b> thread for knitted fabrics, and apparel such as stretch jeans. Cotton can be blended also with linen as Linen-cotton blends which give benefit of both plant materials which wrinkle resistant, lightweight, [...] breathable and can keep heat more effectively than only linen. These blends are thinner and lighter, but stronger than only cotton.|$|R
25|$|The {{smooth green snake}} {{relies on}} an {{environment}} matching its green scales for camouflage to protect itself from predators. If threatened, a smooth green snake will usually flee. It is a docile snake, seldom biting and usually allowing humans to come close. If provoked, it can secrete a substance from its anal gland, causing a foul smell. When handled by humans, it usually shows excited behavior and calms down after wrapping itself around a finger. When it hunts, it turns its {{head from side to}} side, finding prey with its tongue and an organ on the roof of its mouth that interprets chemical signals. It has no ears, relying on vibrations to figure out its surroundings. Its sight is relatively strong over short distances. Due to <b>stretchy</b> ligaments in its jaw, it can swallow prey whole, even those that are larger than its own body diameter. It can shed its skin as often as every four to five weeks, allowing for growth.|$|E

5000|$|One common item {{made in the}} 19th {{century in}} America was the paper canoe, most famously made by Waters & Sons of Troy, New York. The {{invention}} of the continuous sheet paper machine allows paper sheets {{to be made of}} any length, and this made an ideal material for building a seamless boat hull. The paper of the time was significantly <b>stretchier</b> than modern paper, especially when damp, and this was used to good effect in the manufacture of paper boats. A layer of thick, dampened paper was placed over a hull mold and tacked down at the edges. A layer of glue was added, allowed to dry, and sanded down. Additional layers of paper and glue could be added to achieve the desired thickness, and cloth could be added as well to provide additional strength and stiffness. The final product was trimmed, reinforced with wooden strips at the keel and gunwales to provide stiffness, and waterproofed. Paper racing shells were highly competitive during the late 19th century. Few examples of paper boats survived. One of the best known paper boats was the canoe, the [...] "Maria Theresa," [...] used by Nathaniel Holmes Bishop to travel from New York to Florida in 1874-75.

5000|$|Beginning {{about the}} middle of the first season, the show began {{featuring}} the [...] "Assignment America" [...] segment, which called for a series of videos to be sent in (collected or made) pertaining to a specific theme. Another segment introduced during Saget's tenure as host called [...] "Backwards Classics," [...] shows videos being played in reverse set to classical music. Since the show's debut as a regular series, the show routinely includes two to three times per episode, a montage of themed videos set to a particular song, called the [...] "Music Montage"; classic songs (mostly from the 1950s through the 1970s, with only a few songs from the 1980s scattered in) were used during these montages in the original run of the series, though more recent pop, R&B and rock songs have been incorporated since Tom Bergeron became the show's host. In season five, an animated sidekick was introduced named [...] "Stretchy McGillicuddy" [...] (voiced by Danny Mann), who was known for trying to tease Saget and doing other crazy things. In one episode (in season five), he was shown on the two large TV monitors {{on both sides of the}} set and Bob had to turn him off with a remote. <b>Stretchy's</b> catchphrase was: [...] "Don't get a little touchy Bob, I'm just a little stretchy!"

40|$|The {{original}} version {{is available at}} [URL] air-seeding hypothesis predicts that xylem embolism resistance is linked directly to bordered pit functioning. We tested this prediction in trunks, roots, and branches at different vertical and radial locations in young and old trees of Pseudotsuga menziesii. Dimensions of bordered pits were measured from light and scanning electron micrographs, and physiological data were from published values. Consistent with observations, calculations showed that earlywood tracheids were more resistant to embolism than latewood tracheids, mainly from earlywood having <b>stretchier</b> pit membranes that can distend and cover the pit aperture. Air seeding that occurs in earlywood appears to happen through gaps between the torus edge and pit border, {{as shown by the}} similar calculated pressures required to stretch the membrane over the pit aperture and to cause embolism. Although bordered pit functioning was correlated with tracheid hydraulic diameter, pit pore size and above all pit aperture constrained conductivity the most. From roots to branches and from the trunk base to higher on the trunk, hydraulic resistance of the earlywood pit membrane increased significantly because of a decrease {{in the size of the}} pit aperture and size and number of margo pores. Moreover, overall wood conductivity decreased, in part due to lower pit conductivity and a decrease in size and frequency of pits. Structural and functional constraints leading to the trade-off of efficiency against safety of water transport were also demonstrated at the individual pit level, with a positive correlation between pit membrane resistance on an area basis and the pressure differential required to cause membrane stretching, a characteristic that is essential for pit aspiration...|$|R
500|$|Several hundred glands in the endocervix produce 20–60mg of {{cervical}} mucus a day, increasing to 600mg {{around the time}} of ovulation. It is viscous as it contains large proteins known as mucins. The viscosity and water content varies during the menstrual cycle; mucus is composed of around 93% water, reaching 98% at midcycle. These changes allow it to function either as a barrier or a transport medium to spermatozoa. It contains electrolytes such as calcium, sodium, and potassium; organic components such as glucose, amino acids, and soluble proteins; trace elements including zinc, copper, iron, manganese, and selenium; free fatty acids; enzymes such as amylase; and prostaglandins. Its consistency is determined by the influence of the hormones estrogen and progesterone. At midcycle {{around the time of}} ovulation—a period of high estrogen levels— the mucus is thin and serous to allow sperm to enter the uterus, and is more alkaline and hence more hospitable to sperm. It is also higher in electrolytes, which results in the [...] "ferning" [...] pattern that can be observed in drying mucus under low magnification; as the mucus dries, the salts crystallize, resembling the leaves of a fern. The mucus has <b>stretchy</b> character described as Spinnbarkeit most prominent around the time of ovulation.|$|E

40|$|Spider silk has {{outstanding}} mechanical & structural properties, {{despite its}} light and delicate appearance, like high strength and exceptional toughness. Silk {{is twice as}} stretching nylon and eight times more strong than steel. Studying the structural aspects, which bring out these properties, is {{of great interest to}} biopolymer research. It is tougher, <b>stretchier,</b> and more waterproof than the silkworm's strands used today in fine garments. Among the many types of silk that have been characterized till now, the most important varieties include cocoon silk fibroin from the silkworm, Bombyx mori & the dragline silk from the spider Nephila clavipes. The building blocks of spider’s silk are primarily non essential amino acids, Glycine and Alanine & the alignment of these amino acids in various ways is responsible for the unique properties. Insects have found many ways of making a wide range of silk types, but web spiders are unique in maintaining, in the same individual highly specialized glands producing different silks, often simultaneously. Spider spin silks for its various purposes like, dragline silk used to stick the whole web to the wall, glue like sticky catching silk used to catch its prey. Various spiders build up different web pattern, like all orb weaving spiders make suspended, sticky, wheel-shaped orb webs which they place in openings between trees and shrubs where insects are likely to fly, others build up ladder or spiral shaped web for catching their preys. Scientists are trying to find out: How spider spins silk in its glands? Successful copying of the spider's internal processing and precise control over protein folding, combined with knowledge of the gene sequences of its spinning threads, could permit industrial production of silk-based fibers with unique properties...|$|R

2500|$|Gum base {{is made of}} polymers, plasticizers, and resins. Polymers, {{including}} elastomers, {{are responsible}} for the <b>stretchy</b> and sticky nature of chewing gum. Plasticizers improve flexibility and reduce brittleness, contributing to the plastic and elastic nature of gum. The interactions of plasticizers within gum base are governed by solubility parameters, molecular weight, and chemical structure. Resins compose the hydrophobic portion of the gum base, responsible for its chewiness. Although the exact ingredients and proportions used in each brand's gum base are trade secrets within the gum industry, Table 3 lists all of the natural and synthetic gum base components approved for use in the United States, demonstrating some examples of key gum base components.|$|E

2500|$|Mechanical {{force can}} provide a source of energy used by a desired {{chemical}} reaction. To create such materials, mechanically sensitive chemical groups called mechanophores are built into the chemical structure of the polymer. In one set of experiments, researchers used spiropyran molecules to detect mechanical stress. The spiropyran (SP) mechanophore was covalently bonded into a <b>stretchy</b> barbell-shaped polymer called polymethyl acrylate (PMA) and a small, glasslike bead-shaped polymer called polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). SP transformed into a fluorescent merocyanine (MC) form in response to stress. [...] The orientation of the MC subspecies relative to the tensile force could be characterized based on the anisotropy of the fluorescence polarization. [...] Spiropyrans were normally colorless but turned vivid shades of red or purple when stressed. They also fluoresce. The researchers have also demonstrated that mechanical force can power a chemical response in the polymer, changing the covalent bonding. A next step in this research is to explore the potential to use mechanochemical reactions to activate chemical pathways in materials to respond to shock waves in positive ways, by altering or enhancing properties of the material.|$|E

An exact limit to the size it can grow to in this manner is unknown. Jigglypuff are characterized by putting their enemies to sleep by singing a lullaby. Before beginning to sing, they mesmerize the opponent with their soft, glowing eyes, and if they inflate themselves, they can sing for longer periods of time. They can easily adjust the wavelength of their voices to that of the brain waves of a sleeping being, allowing for their pleasing melody to put its audience to sleep. They sing without pausing to take a breath, so if the opponent is resistant to sleeping, they potentially run out of air. Game Freak's staff have noted Jigglypuff as both one of their and the public's favorite Pokémon, in terms of both anime and video game appearances.|$|E
