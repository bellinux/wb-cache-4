5|$|Reviewing {{the book}}, Charles E. Osgood {{classified}} {{the book as}} a graduate-level text based more on objective facts than on theoretical constructs. He thought the book was verbose on some topics and too brief on others {{not directly related to}} the author's expertise area. He was also critical of Miller's use of simple, Skinnerian single-stage <b>stimulus-response</b> learning to explain human language acquisition and use. This approach, per Osgood, made it impossible to analyze the concept of meaning, and the idea of language consisting of representational signs. He did find the book objective in its emphasis on facts over theory, and depicting clearly application of information theory to psychology.|$|E
5|$|In Plans and the Structure of Behavior, Miller and his co-authors {{tried to}} explain through an artificial-intelligence {{computational}} perspective how animals plan and act. This was a radical break from behaviorism which explained behavior as a set or sequence of <b>stimulus-response</b> actions. The authors introduced a planning element controlling such actions. They saw all plans as being executed based on input using a stored or inherited information of the environment (called the image), and using a strategy called test-operate-test-exit (TOTE). The image was essentially a stored memory of all past context, akin to Tolman's cognitive map. The TOTE strategy, in its initial test phase, compared the input against the image; if there was incongruity the operate function attempted to reduce it. This cycle would be repeated till the incongruity vanished, and then the exit function would be invoked, passing control to another TOTE unit in a hierarchically arranged scheme.|$|E

25|$|Respondent (classical) {{conditioning}} {{is based}} on innate <b>stimulus-response</b> relationships called reflexes. In his famous experiments with dogs, Pavlov usually used the salivary reflex, namely salivation (unconditioned response) following the taste of food (unconditioned stimulus). Pairing a neutral stimulus, for example a bell (conditioned stimulus) with food caused the bell to elicit salivation (conditioned response). Thus, in classical conditioning, the conditioned stimulus becomes a signal for a biologically significant consequence. Note that in respondent conditioning, unlike operant conditioning, the response does not produce a reinforcer or punisher (e.g. the dog does not get food because it salivates).|$|E
25|$|The {{properties}} of the nodal membrane largely determine the axon's strength-duration properties, and these will change with changes in membrane potential, with temperature, and with demyelination as the exposed membrane is effectively enlarged by the inclusion of paranodal and intermodal membrane. Thus, the strength-duration time constant {{is a reflection of}} persistent Na+ channel function, and is furthermore influenced by membrane potential and passive membrane properties. As such, many aspects of nerve excitability testing depend on sodium channel functions: namely, the strength-duration time constant, the recovery cycle, the <b>stimulus-response</b> curve, and the current-threshold relationship. Measuring responses in nerve that are related to nodal function (including strength-duration time constant and rheobase) and internodal function has allowed insight into normal axon physiology as well as normal fluctuations of electrolyte concentrations.|$|E
25|$|A {{handful of}} {{comparative}} psychologists {{have attempted to}} demonstrate quasi-economic reasoning in non-human animals. Early attempts along these lines focus {{on the behavior of}} rats and pigeons. These studies draw on the tenets of comparative psychology, where the main goal is to discover analogs to human behavior in experimentally-tractable non-human animals. They are also methodologically similar to the work of Ferster and Skinner. Methodological similarities aside, early researchers in non-human economics deviate from behaviorism in their terminology. Although such studies are set up primarily in an operant conditioning chamber using food rewards for pecking/bar-pressing behavior, the researchers describe pecking and bar-pressing not in terms of reinforcement and <b>stimulus-response</b> relationships but instead in terms of work, demand, budget, and labor. Recent studies have adopted a slightly different approach, taking a more evolutionary perspective, comparing economic behavior of humans to a species of non-human primate, the capuchin monkey.|$|E
25|$|Kenneth Spence {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{well-known}} of Hull’s graduate students. He developed and extended Hull's neo-behaviorist theory into what came to be called the Hull-Spence theory of conditioning, learning, and motivation. This theory states that people learn <b>stimulus-response</b> associations when a stimulus and response occur together, and reinforcement motivates the person to engage in the behavior and increases the occurrence of the learned behavior. Spence contributed to the study of incentive motivation and developing mathematical formulation and equations to describe learning acquisition. Spence attributed improvement in performance to motivational factors rather than the habit factors of Hull’s theory. He believed that reinforcement was not always necessary for learning to occur and that people can learn through latent learning. He also developed a discrimination learning theory. His discrimination theory suggests that there are gradients of excitatory and inhibitory potential that are generated around the values of the stimulus that are either reinforced or not.|$|E
25|$|Non-human {{research}} {{still has}} a major place in this field, however, and is especially useful in illuminating which nonverbal behaviors signify components of theory of mind, and in pointing to possible stepping points {{in the evolution of}} what many claim to be a uniquely human aspect of social cognition. While it is difficult to study human-like theory of mind and mental states in species whose potential mental states we have an incomplete understanding, researchers can focus on simpler components of more complex capabilities. For example, many researchers focus on animals' understanding of intention, gaze, perspective, or knowledge (or rather, what another being has seen). Call and Tomasello's study that looked at understanding of intention in orangutans, chimpanzees and children showed that all three species understood the difference between accidental and intentional acts. Part of the difficulty in this line of research is that observed phenomena can often be explained as simple <b>stimulus-response</b> learning, {{as it is in the}} nature of any theorizers of mind to have to extrapolate internal mental states from observable behavior. Recently, most non-human theory of mind research has focused on monkeys and great apes, who are of most interest in the study of the evolution of human social cognition. Other studies relevant to attributions theory of mind have been conducted using plovers and dogs, and have shown preliminary evidence of understanding attention—one precursor of theory of mind—in others.|$|E
2500|$|Historically, {{for many}} years the {{predominant}} view of {{the function of the}} nervous system was as a <b>stimulus-response</b> associator. [...] In this conception, neural processing begins with stimuli that activate sensory neurons, producing signals that propagate through chains of connections in the spinal cord and brain, giving rise eventually to activation of motor neurons and thereby to muscle contraction, i.e., to overt responses. [...] Descartes believed that all of the behaviors of animals, and most of the behaviors of humans, could be explained in terms of <b>stimulus-response</b> circuits, although he also believed that higher cognitive functions such as language were not capable of being explained mechanistically. [...] Charles Sherrington, in his influential 1906 book The Integrative Action of the Nervous System, developed the concept of <b>stimulus-response</b> mechanisms in much more detail, and Behaviorism, the school of thought that dominated Psychology through the middle of the 20th century, attempted to explain every aspect of human behavior in <b>stimulus-response</b> terms.|$|E
2500|$|Scholars in the Chengshi zong 成實宗 or Tattvasiddhi School {{were engaged}} in a {{controversy}} over the nature of <b>stimulus-response.</b> For example, the Dasheng Xuanlun 大乘玄論 [...] "Treatise on the Mystery of the Mahāyāna" [...] by Zhizang 智藏 (458-522) explains ganying, ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1973, Mintzberg {{found that}} senior {{managers}} typically deal with unpredictable situations so they strategize in ad hoc, flexible, dynamic, and implicit ways. He wrote, [...] "The job breeds adaptive information-manipulators who prefer the live concrete situation. The manager works {{in an environment}} of <b>stimulus-response,</b> and he develops in his work a clear preference for live action." ...|$|E
2500|$|These {{observations}} and others appear {{to contradict the}} law of effect, and they have prompted some researchers to propose new conceptualizations of operant reinforcement [...] (e.g.) [...] A more general view is that autoshaping is an instance of classical conditioning; the autoshaping procedure has, in fact, {{become one of the}} most common ways to measure classical conditioning. [...] In this view, many behaviors can be influenced by both classical contingencies (<b>stimulus-response)</b> and operant contingencies (response-reinforcement), and the experimenter’s task is to work out how these interact.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Stimulus-response</b> is {{the great}} tenet of the buddha-dharma, the {{essential}} teaching of the many sutras. To [...] "stimulate" [...] means to bring or summon forth, and to [...] "respond" [...] means to go forth and meet in welcome. As all sentient beings possess [...] goodness, they may induce the Buddhas to descend and take shape in front of them, and [...] will meet them in welcome. The principle [...] neither deviate nor overshoot [...] This is called stimulus and response. The common person stimulates but does not respond; the Buddhas respond but do not stimulate; and bodhisattvas both respond and stimulate. (tr. Sharf 2002: 121-122) ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{experimental}} studies of electrophysiology, {{beginning in the early}} 20th century and reaching high productivity by the 1940s, showed that the nervous system contains many mechanisms for generating patterns of activity intrinsically, without requiring an external stimulus. [...] Neurons were found to be capable of producing regular sequences of action potentials, or sequences of bursts, even in complete isolation. [...] When intrinsically active neurons are connected to each other in complex circuits, the possibilities for generating intricate temporal patterns become far more extensive. [...] A modern conception views the function of the nervous system partly in terms of <b>stimulus-response</b> chains, and partly in terms of intrinsically generated activity patterns—both types of activity interact with each other to generate the full repertoire of behavior.|$|E
2500|$|Although <b>stimulus-response</b> {{mechanisms}} are {{the easiest to}} understand, the nervous system is also capable of controlling the body in ways {{that do not require}} an external stimulus, by means of internally generated rhythms of activity. Because of the variety of voltage-sensitive ion channels that can be embedded in the membrane of a neuron, many types of neurons are capable, even in isolation, of generating rhythmic sequences of action potentials, or rhythmic alternations between high-rate bursting and quiescence. When neurons that are intrinsically rhythmic are connected to each other by excitatory or inhibitory synapses, the resulting networks are capable {{of a wide variety of}} dynamical behaviors, including attractor dynamics, periodicity, and even chaos. [...] A network of neurons that uses its internal structure to generate temporally structured output, without requiring a corresponding temporally structured stimulus, is called a central pattern generator.|$|E
2500|$|Their {{new style}} of psychology, later dubbed {{functional}} psychology, had a practical emphasis on action and application. In Dewey's article [...] "The Reflex Arc Concept in Psychology" [...] {{which appeared in}} Psychological Review in 1896, he reasons against the traditional <b>stimulus-response</b> understanding of the reflex arc {{in favor of a}} [...] "circular" [...] account in which what serves as [...] "stimulus" [...] and what as [...] "response" [...] depends on how one considers the situation, and defends the unitary nature of the sensory motor circuit. While he does not deny the existence of stimulus, sensation, and response, he disagreed that they were separate, juxtaposed events happening like links in a chain. He developed {{the idea that there is}} a coordination by which the stimulation is enriched by the results of previous experiences. The response is modulated by sensorial experience.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{behavioral}} researchers studied <b>stimulus–response</b> pairings, {{now known}} as classical conditioning. They demonstrated that behaviors could be linked through repeated association with stimuli eliciting pain or pleasure. Ivan Pavlov—known best for inducing dogs to salivate {{in the presence of}} a stimulus previous linked with food—became a leading figure in the Soviet Union and inspired followers to use his methods on humans. In the United States, Edward Lee Thorndike initiated [...] "connectionism" [...] studies by trapping animals in [...] "puzzle boxes" [...] and rewarding them for escaping. Thorndike wrote in 1911: [...] "There can be no moral warrant for studying man's nature unless the study will enable us to control his acts." [...] From 1910–1913 the American Psychological Association went through a sea change of opinion, away from mentalism and towards [...] "behavioralism", and in 1913 John B. Watson coined the term behaviorism for this school of thought. Watson's famous Little Albert experiment in 1920 demonstrated that repeated use of upsetting loud noises could instill phobias (aversions to other stimuli) in an infant human. Karl Lashley, a close collaborator with Watson, examined biological manifestations of learning in the brain.|$|E

50|$|William Kaye Estes (June 17, 1919 - August 17, 2011) was an American psychologist. A Review of General Psychology survey, {{published}} in 2002, ranked Estes as the 77th most cited psychologist of the 20th century. In {{order to develop}} a statistical explanation for the learning phenomena, William Kaye Estes developed the Stimulus Sampling Theory in 1950 which suggested that a <b>stimulus-response</b> association is learned on a single trial; however, the learning process is continuous and consists of the accumulation of distinct <b>stimulus-response</b> pairings.|$|E
50|$|Ewert and {{coworkers}} showed in toads {{that there are}} <b>stimulus-response</b> mediating pathways that translate perception (of visual sign stimuli) into action (adequate behavioral responses). In addition there are modulatory loops that initiate, modify or specify this mediation (Ewert 2004). Regarding the latter, for example, the telencephalic caudal ventral striatum {{is involved in a}} loop gating the <b>stimulus-response</b> mediation in a manner of directed attention. The telencephalic ventral medial pallium („primordium hippocampi"), however, is involved in loops that either modify prey-selection due to associative learning or specify prey-selection due to non-associative learning, respectively.|$|E
5000|$|Estes {{proposed}} {{a model of}} learning that he called Stimulus Sampling Theory (SST). SST is a probabilistic model that provides a statistical explanation of how we learn a <b>stimulus-response</b> association in a single trial, but require more <b>stimulus-response</b> repetitions to build an evident unit of learning. Stimulus-sampling models aid at least two functions. One is to make experimental predictions for situations in which the stimulus elements are controlled, in part at least, by the experimenter. The stimulus-sampling theory also aids as a heuristic device for discovering effective truisms about changes in response probabilities. The general theory of stimulus-sampling assumes {{the existence of a}} population of discrete stimulus elements and hypothesizes that an entity draws a sample from this population on each trial of a learning experiment. All <b>stimulus-response</b> theories have stimuli that are [...] "connected" [...] or [...] "conditioned" [...] to possible responses of the entity. A natural extension of SST theory provides explanations of discrimination, generalization, temporal processes, and even motivational phenomena.|$|E
