5|$|Whirling {{disease was}} first {{detected}} in fish in Johnson Lake in Banff National Park in May, 2016. CFIA Labs confirmed in August and Parks Canada announced the outbreak August 23, 2016. Although {{it was first}} discovered in Banff, {{it is not necessarily}} where the disease originated and spread. The Government of Alberta is currently <b>sampling</b> <b>and</b> <b>testing</b> fish in 6 different watersheds (Peace River, Athabasca, North Saskatchewan, Red Deer, Bow and Oldman) to see where the disease has spread. Initial sample fish were collected in 2016, and are currently being processed by the Government of Alberta and CFIA labs. Since testing began, it has been detected in the Upper Bow River, and in May 2017 it was confirmed that whirling disease had also been detected in the Oldman River Basin. The declaration does not mean that every susceptible finfish population within the Bow and Oldman River watersheds are infected with the disease.|$|E

2500|$|If {{the patient}} or the caregivers, (typically parents) agree, the medical team {{utilizes}} standardized <b>sampling</b> <b>and</b> <b>testing</b> usually {{referred to a}} forensic evidence kit or [...] "rape kit". The patient is informed that submitting {{to the use of}} the rape kit does not obligate them to file criminal charges against the perpetrator. The patient is discouraged from bathing or showering for the purpose of obtaining samples from his or her hair. Evidence gathered within the past 72 hours is more likely to be valid. The sooner that samples are obtained after the assault, the more likely that evidence is present in the sample and provide valid results. Once the injuries of the patient have been treated and she or he is stabilized, the sample gathering will begin. Staff will encourage the presence of a rape/sexual assault counselor to provide an advocate and reassurance.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT—Does visual {{working memory}} {{represent}} a fixed number of objects, or is capacity reduced as object com-plexity increases? We measured accuracy in detecting changes between <b>sample</b> <b>and</b> <b>test</b> displays <b>and</b> found that capacity estimates dropped as complexity increased. How-ever, these apparent capacity reductions were strongly correlatedwith increases in sample-test similarity (r 5. 97), raising {{the possibility that}} change detection was limited by errors in comparing the <b>sample</b> <b>and</b> <b>test,</b> {{rather than by the}} number of items that were maintained in working memory. Accordingly, when sample-test similarity was low, capac-ity estimates for even the most complex objects were equivalent to the estimate for the simplest objects (r 5. 88), suggesting that visual working memory represents a fixed number of items regardless of complexity. Finally, a cor...|$|R
