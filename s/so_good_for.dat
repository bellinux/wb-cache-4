25|$|In 1896, Druce again {{did well}} for Cambridge {{with the weather}} even drier than in the {{corresponding}} period of 1895. He was not available for Surrey after the University season ended, but in 1897, after being appointed captain of Cambridge University, he surpassed his 1895 form, averaging 66 an innings. Although he was again disappointing for Surrey later that year, his form was <b>so</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> the University that Wisden chose Druce {{as one of their}} Five Cricketers of the Year for 1898 and he toured Australia.|$|E
500|$|... "The Love Club" [...] is a electropop song. It {{addresses}} the befriending of [...] "a bad crowd." [...] Lorde explained the song's lyrical meaning to New York magazine, [...] "'The Love Club' {{is about an}} experience I had {{about a year ago}} where I met all these new friends and I fell in with them. It happened overnight and I couldn't think of anything but our friends and our situation. Then I started to maybe realise that group wasn't <b>so</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> me, and that my old friends and my family are the people I should be with. It's about being drawn into this crazy world, and you’re all in love".|$|E

500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the episode, several physicians played a game of baseball to cheer up. Rater called it [...] "her favorite scene", explaining: [...] "I loved the scene where Owen, Derek and Mark take Cristina, Meredith and Lexie to the baseball field. This {{is one of the first}} times Owen has seen Cristina's intensity. And I love that he makes her leave the hospital, focus on something else. That's why he's <b>so</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> her. The scene was actually inspired by Shonda saying, let's do a scene where they're all playing baseball. But when I finally saw it, it makes me want to write more scenes like that, with our doctors outside of the hospital, little glimpses of them in real life." ...|$|E
500|$|In early 1911, Mertz went to London to {{meet with}} the Australian {{geologist}} and explorer Douglas Mawson. Mawson, who had served as physicist during Ernest Shackleton's 1908–09 Nimrod Expedition, was planning his own Antarctic expedition. In his application letter, Mertz wrote that he hoped Mawson would be using skis, as [...] "they have proved <b>so</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> the purpose & knowing that I am as good as any one on skys." [...] While Mawson was intending to recruit only British subjects (chiefly Australians and New Zealanders), Mertz's qualifications prompted him to make an exception, and hire the Swiss as a ski instructor. First, however, he was given responsibility for the expedition's 49Greenland Huskies, aboard the expedition ship SY Aurora, bound for Hobart.|$|E
500|$|Tender Mercies {{was shown}} in {{competition}} at the 1983 Cannes Film Festival, where it {{was described as a}} relatively optimistic alternative to darker, more violent entries like One Deadly Summer, Moon in the Gutter and Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence. It was also shown at the 1983 International Film Festival of India in New Delhi. A jury headed by director Lindsay Anderson determined that none of the films in contention, including Tender Mercies, were good enough to win the Golden Peacock, the festival's top prize. Film critic Jugu Abraham said the jury's standards were higher than those of the Academy Awards, and [...] that Tender Mercies lack of success at the festival was a [...] "clear example of what is good cinema for some, not being <b>so</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> others".|$|E

2500|$|One of Foster's {{most memorable}} bass lines {{was in the}} theme tune to the late-70s UK TV show [...] "Minder" [...] {{starring}} Dennis Waterman. The tune, [...] "I Can Be <b>So</b> <b>Good</b> <b>For</b> You" [...] started out life as a track on Waterman's solo album, it was then re-jigged as the show's theme tune. Mo achieved the atypical bass sound by using an unusual bass slap technique on an aluminium Kramer 650B bass guitar.|$|E
2500|$|All of {{the drum}} tracks had been {{recorded}} at The Pool at Miloco Studios in London, {{over the course}} of three weekends in late 2015. The drums were recorded here due to the band's personal studio consisting solely of a control room, a live room, and storage for their equipment. Duce said their studio was [...] "great for close mic stuff but not <b>so</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> big room drums." [...] Vocal overdubs and stomps were also recorded. Dan Lancaster produced the sessions here, with assistance from Sam Harper and Jamie McEvoy. Lancaster also engineered the drums, with additional drum engineering by Darren Jones. Jones mentioned that the group originally planned to record a few songs but [...] "liked the sound so much they decided to do the [...] whole album". Following the end of a UK tour in December 2015, the band members went on a six month break to spend time with family. According to Duce, the group spent a period of time [...] "refining our sound as well as trying some new techniques." ...|$|E

2500|$|The theme tune, [...] "I Could Be <b>So</b> <b>Good</b> <b>for</b> You", was {{released}} on 13 October 1980 and originally written in 1979 by Gerard Kenny and Patricia Waterman and sung by Dennis Waterman, the official credits of Kenny/Waterman often lead people to mis-credit Dennis as co-writer. The record reached No.3 in the UK charts in November 1980 and led Waterman to tour as a singer. Dennis Waterman also sang the theme songs to other programmes he starred in, including On the Up, Stay Lucky, and New Tricks, and {{this led to a}} parody in Little Britain where Dennis Waterman is offered acting work; he always assumes he will also [...] "write the theme tune, sing the theme tune...". Dennis Waterman surprised the audience of a Comic Relief stage show where he came on stage {{in the middle of a}} Little Britain sketch, bemoaning the impact it has had on his work as a 'classically trained actor'. He does however forgive the sketch so long as he gets to sing his 'theme tune', to which he does to rapturous applause.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout Austen's fiction, {{according}} to feminist critics, female characters comment on male-authored texts and {{take charge of}} the creation of their own worlds. In their seminal work The Madwoman in the Attic (1979), noted feminist critics Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar argue that the literary world is dominated by men and their stories, and that Austen recognized and critiqued this. The best-known example is from Northanger Abbey, in which the heroine, Catherine, complains that history [...] "tells [...] nothing that does not either vex or weary [...] The quarrels of popes and kings, with wars or pestilences, in every page; the men all <b>so</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> nothing, and hardly any women at all—it is very tiresome". Austen's juvenile parody of Oliver Goldsmith's History of England is [...] "authored" [...] by [...] "a partial, prejudiced, and ignorant Historian". In such statements, Austen suggests that history is a masculine fiction and of little importance to women. Feminist critics also focus {{on the role of the}} female artist in Austen's fiction. For example, Claudia Johnson views Emma as a powerful heroine, an artist who controls her home, her marriage choice, her community and her money. Emma composes stories for people's lives and thereby represents the figure of the female artist.|$|E

5000|$|Michael Hickey, {{originally}} of Manhasset, New York, is a screenwriter {{best known}} for the screenplay of the horror film Silent Night, Deadly Night. Hickey's controversial screenplay focused on a serial killer who, disguised as Santa Claus, takes the lyric [...] "He knows if you've been bad or <b>good</b> <b>so</b> be <b>good</b> <b>for</b> goodness sake" [...] rather too literally.|$|R
