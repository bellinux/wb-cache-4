50|$|There is {{evidence}} that such large area solar concentrating installations can kill birds that fly over them. Near {{the center of the}} array temperatures can reach 550 oC which, with the solar flux itself, is enough to incinerate birds while further away feathers are scorched leading to the eventual death of the bird. Workers at the Ivanpah solar power plant call these birds “streamers,” as they ignite in midair and plummet to the ground trailing smoke. During testing of the initial <b>standby</b> <b>position</b> for the heliostats, 115 birds were killed as they entered the concentrated solar flux. After adjusting the <b>standby</b> <b>position</b> to not focus all the solar energy into a single point, during the following 6 months of operations, a total of 321 birds were killed. However newly developed technique is available to prevent further bird fatalities.|$|E

They departed Jaluit on 26 November 1941 to patrol the sea lanes between Australia, Samoa, Fiji, the United States, and the Panama Canal. The operational plan was for one ship to lie-to and drift while performing maintenance, as the other ship carried out a perimeter patrol searching for enemy shipping. The two ships would spend the hours of darkness within visual range; the ships then reversed roles the following day. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, the search objective changed from avoiding detection to locating enemy commerce.|$|E
5000|$|The FT's {{exposure}} control system was a [...] "center-the-needle" [...] system using a galvanometer needle pointer moving vertically {{at the lower}} {{right side of the}} viewfinder to indicate the readings of the built-in, open aperture, TTL, full-scene averaging, cadmium sulfide (CdS) light meter versus the actual camera settings. The photographer would adjust the shutter speed to freeze or blur motion and/or the lens aperture f-stop to control depth of field (focus) until the needle was centered between two pincer-like brackets. The needle array was duplicated in a window next the top-mounted film rewind crank to allow {{exposure control}} without looking through the viewfinder.

She later studied at New York University Steinhardt School of Education before attending an open call for the musical Hairspray. After winning over the producers, Dideriksen was first sent to the Toronto Hairspray cast and then joined the touring company. Dideriksen originated the role of Tracy for The Luxor production of Hairspray in Las Vegas opposite Harvey Fierstein. She played Tracy until the Vegas show closed in June 2006.

50|$|A {{series of}} small crises slowed down the process. Lloyd Cutler, one of the White House attorneys, told the {{president}} there was a delay in the transfer of assets; the Federal Reserve Bank of New York did not have its part of the money, so funds were shifted among the reserve banks. Another difficulty concerned the time difference between Washington and Tehran. Because of the war with Iraq, the Iranian officials had blackouts of airport lights. This meant that once it got dark in Iran (about 9:30 a.m. Washington time), even if the deal had been sealed, the Algerian pilots would not take off until dawn. Thus, if the departure time passed, everyone understood {{that it would be}} another eight to ten hours before anything could happen. In the wee hours of January 19, 1981, word came to Carter that the planes were on the runway in Tehran, and the hostages had been taken to the vicinity of the airport. At 4:44 a.m. Carter went to the press briefing room to announce that with the help of Algeria the United States and Iran had reached an agreement, but was halted because the Algerian negotiator sent word that the Iranian bank officials did not agree with the terms of accountability in the banking agreements, so the planes were returned to their <b>standby</b> <b>position.</b> The staff soon understood that Carter's trip to Germany to greet hostages would not occur until after the inauguration.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cutting the cervix, morcellation, and {{extraction}} {{of the uterus}} and myomata remain major problems in endoscopic surgery. We developed an efficient, safe, reusable, and inexpensive instrument to cut the cervix and morcellate the uterus and myomata: the morcellator knife. INSTRUMENT: The morcellator knife is a classic lancet with an interchangeable blade, transformed into an endoscopic instrument that can be inserted easily through a 10 -mm-diameter trocar. The blade has an automatic retraction system and {{is set in the}} <b>standby</b> <b>position,</b> ensuring security. Cutting the cervix and uterine or myoma fragmentation are easy. The mass to be cut is held between two grasping forceps for easy cutting with the blade, under permanent visual control. After morcellation, {{extraction of}} the masses is performed through a posterior culdotomy. EXPERIENCE: We have used this morcellator knife in 54 subtotal hysterectomies and 16 myomectomies. There were no complications during the procedures. Morcellation lasted 3 - 14 minutes and involved the use of an average of two to three blades. CONCLUSION: The morcellator knife is a simple, safe, reusable, and inexpensive instrument with a low maintenance cost...|$|E
40|$|Simple {{multiband}} planar antenna for {{wireless communication}} applications is presented. The proposed antenna performs four resonant modes covering multibands of wireless standards, including LTE 700, GSM, DCS, PCS, UMTS, and LTE 2300 / 2500. Furthermore, it covers the ISM, WiMAX, and the WLAN bands. The {{geometry of the}} proposed antenna consists of a single FR 4 substrate where an open cavity fed by a coplanar U-shaped monopole is etched {{on one side and}} a short-circuited meander line in the opposite side. The cavity by its nature supports a wide range of higher frequencies, while its boundary that consists of a thin monopole resonates at 900 [*]MHz. The meander line in the opposite side supports the LTE 700 band. The operating bands ranges are (680 – 748 [*]MHz), (870 – 960 [*]MHZ), (1. 36 – 1. 59 [*]GHz), and (1. 71 – 2. 56 [*]GHz). The antenna size is 30 × 18 × 0. 8 [*]mm 3. The antenna not only has a compact size but also supports a low SAR radiation at all the operating frequencies.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} the automatization {{of a rock}} breaker boom equipped with a hydraulic hammer. The studied use case of an automatized breaker boom consists of trajectory generation from a <b>standby</b> <b>position</b> to preprogrammed locations on a steel grid. The operator shall {{be able to choose}} a specific location of the grid from a user interface and the boom shall automatically move above the chosen location, do an approach movement towards the grid and switch the hydraulic hammer on when contact with an external object is detected. During this sequence the angle of the rock hammer should be constantly maintained at vertical orientation relative to the grid. The developed solution for contact detection is based on impedance control, which is a form of indirect force control built on top of an underlying operational-space tool centre control scheme. To implement impedance control for hydraulic manipulators, pressure sensors and knowledge of boom kinematics and dynamics are necessary. In its simplest form, modeled configuration-dependent gravitational forces affecting the hydraulic cylinders are subtracted from pressure readings and mapped into forces affecting in Cartesian space to yield a rough estimate of contact forces affecting on the manipulator. The estimated contact forces are then filtered into a position modification that indirectly regulates the force affecting on the tool tip of the manipulator. The force tracking performance is dependent on the underlying position controller, which is why the control scheme is referred to as position-based impedance control. In this thesis, an impedance controller was developed for a four degrees-of-freedom hydraulic manipulator and it was verified using a simulation model of the manipulator. The sequence was implemented on the actual breaker plant and a simple position controller was tuned, but the original objective of identifying dynamic parameters and testing of the impedance controller for contact detection {{as a part of the}} automatic sequence was not met...|$|E
40|$|The {{division}} of Engineering Materials at Linköping University, department of Management and Engineering, conducted {{a research project}} concerning Fatigue life of thermal barrier coatings during 2009. During this project equipment to provoke these fatigue failure by rapidly heating and cooling test subjects in cycles, was ordered. Design and manufacturing of the equipment was handled internally at LIU. The equipment was built using a furnace that is lowered and raised over the table where the test subject is placed. To keep {{the temperature of the}} furnace a lid slides in place to close the downward facing opening of the furnace when it is in the raised position. On this door there is nozzle that is used to cooling of the test subject by air. To make sure that the equipment can work independently you need an automation controller that can evaluate if movement can occur without danger of collisions. The control system also needs to monitor that all elements are performed according to plan. This degree project is based on a modular system from OPTO 22 and includes the configuration of a PLC that will be supplied with logic and a user interface. The degree project resulted in a graphic interface in which a user can set desired values for different parameters and get information about current values for them. Using the interface the user could also start and stop the running of cycles. An analog interface consisting of a start and stop button is also handled in the project. Logic has been created and tested using simulations of incoming signals. During these tests it managed to transform the equipment from standby to starting position for running cycles, running cycles that can be adapted by the user and to put the equipment in <b>standby</b> <b>position</b> when the user want to power down the system. Apart from this there is also routines to monitor that movements is actually done according to plan and communicates with external systems capable of sending signals.

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{assessment}} of the development perspectives of the new grape varieties, resistant to fungal diseases, promoting therefore the reduction or the suppression of phytosanitary treatments. Based on a direct survey with researchers, stakeholders, a synthesis of the scientific literature and edited research programs, we propose an overview of {{the current state of the}} art of the supply of technology, and a presentation of the main stakeholders strategy involved in the innovation chain, a synthesis of the current scientific and technical controversies, and an analysis of the undertaking of the institutions and of the legislation. Further, we provide an evaluation of the previous research program on new grape varieties of the French National Institute for Research in Agronomy (INRA) and the results of the diffusion achieved in Languedoc-Roussillon. This analysis will allow us to discuss the conditions for the success of this innovation as a competitiveness factor. Obtaining a new grape variety is a long term process that can last up to 20 or 30 years. According to the evolutionary approach (Nelson and Winter, 1982), it is the technological paradigm of the research programs intending to improve the proprieties of the plant that defines the technological trajectory. In relation with this delay for the obtaining new grape varieties, the success of the diffusion of the new varieties faces three main difficulties: (1) Professionals need to agree on the relevance of the paradigm, In other words on the characteristics of the research program; (2) A gap appears between the characteristics of new varieties proposed for diffusion and the new perception of the needs of those professionals or their market, broadly different 25 years later, and (3) the rhythm of the diffusion of these innovations, approximately 2. 5 %/year, related to the life-cycle of the vine plant. In France, the awareness of obtaining grape varieties resistant to diseases emerged quite late, except in the case of the work of one research director from INRA, starting the improvement of the varieties in that direction in the 1980 s. His work was merely recently resumed. Since World War II, those working in Europe on the new grape varieties have been mainly public researchers. However, the contractual relationships with stakeholders in charge of spreading those varieties – the nurseries -vary considerably according to the countries, the size and the strategy of the grape nurseries. The issues related to licenses and royalties are an essential matter. The industry is therefore characterized by the presence of various resistant grape varieties created in several countries in Europe by researchers or grape nurseries. In each country where the new varieties were created, new varieties were registered in every national catalogue, but registration of those foreign varieties were not, until today, extended to the French national catalogue. Therefore, it excludes those varieties from potential CAP subsidies. Some innovative grape growers anticipated the social demand and adopted those resistant varieties without the support of public subsidies. In addition, those grape growers processed the grapes and established a label to highlight this environmental advantage. A scientific controversy adds to the environmental and social issues, which deals with the ‘stability of the resistance’ over time. In short, the first varieties obtained featured a ‘monogenic’ resistance, considered by some researchers as easily circumvented. These researchers block or try to slow down the availability of new resistant varieties, waiting for the registration at the French national catalogue of a ‘new wave’ of grape varieties whose resistance would be ‘polygenic’. This scientific controversy creates uncertainty for public officers and a <b>standby</b> <b>position</b> criticized by those wishing a faster diffusion of those innovations in the wine chain. Further, the wine production in Europe is traditionally characterized by quality designations of origin - PGI and PDO – which base their reputation on the main traditional grape varieties and therefore exclude new grape varieties. In France, those quality designations account for approximately 85 percent of the wine production and create most of the value in the wine chain. This exclusion inhibits significant extension. Finally, the issues allowing the rapid diffusion of resistant grape varieties excluding pesticides might include: fostering the rate of renewing vineyards, the register of new European grape varieties in the French national catalogue, the full or partial acceptation of the new grape varieties in PDO areas, the increase of the political pressure from ecologists and the civil society about the reduction of phytosanitary inputs, the integration of those varieties in the national endowment of the wine CMO for the restructuring of vineyards or, finally, the insertion of resistance genes in traditional varieties through faster means than classic genetics. However, the strategy consisting in the creation of new varieties through GMO methods seems not adapted to the Society, including at the research level...|$|E
