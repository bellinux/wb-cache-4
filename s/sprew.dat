40|$|This {{report has}} been {{realised}} {{in the framework}} of the <b>SPREW</b> project (social patterns of relationship to work). It consists of an overview of relevant quantitative surveys conducted at the national or regional level in all the countries included in the partnership. It also gives an overview of quantitative survey schemes conducted at the European and international levels. It provides a transversal overview of all the surveys inventoried and points out interesting conclusions regarding the <b>SPReW</b> issues. In addition, this report gathers some quantitative data about each country that support a good understanding {{of the results of the}} quantitative and qualitative workpackage...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} based on a European {{research}} project 1 (<b>SPReW)</b> that focused on the intergenerational dimensions of changes in relations to work. The aim was to point out areas of solidarity and tensions between the generations in work and to question some hypotheses concerning the young generation, notably the development of different attitudes, values...|$|E

Richie Unterberger praised Bonniwell's {{composition}} for its experimentation and raw sound. Unterberger described the song as [...] "...the most radical single to be heard on Top 40 radio in late 1966. Against a succession of grinding two-note fuzz riffs and key changes that rose and Rose until it hit the ceiling, Bonniwell <b>sprewed</b> and growled a rally cry to social alienation {{with a mixture of}} sarcasm, self-pity, and paranoia".|$|R
5000|$|In 1990, TOMY re-released {{several of}} the 1:24 scale Zoids in a new line called Zevle. The Zoids were recoloured from the OJR versions, and came with detailed, 3 inch tall action figures of the pilot and crew. The pilot figures were {{unpainted}} and on <b>sprews,</b> much like a model kit, {{and had to be}} assembled. The crew figures also came with accessories of guns and beam sabers. Zevle featured its own [...] "Battle Story" [...] on the boxes, but while it was similar to the Zoids Battle Story, it was unrelated to it.|$|R
40|$|This report gathers the {{analyses}} {{that have been}} conducted in each country {{in the framework of}} the <b>SPREW</b> project (social patterns of relationship to work) in a common qualitative approach, consisting in a total of 163 narrative interviews and 18 group interviews. A common methodological design supports this in-depth empirical study. The first chapter proposes a synthesis overview of all contributions. The report provides a renewed perspective on the meaning of work for different generation...|$|E
40|$|This report {{gives an}} {{overview}} of all key research activities, findings and conclusions of the <b>SPREW</b> project (social patterns of relationship to work). The first chapter summarises the main topics {{of the state of}} the art of current research. The second chapter describes the methodological design of the project. The third chapter proposes a synthesis of the qualitative approach, as well as the fourth a synthesis of the quantitative approach. The fifth chapter summarises the results of the cross-national comparative analysis, stressing both European convergence and national diversity. Chapter 6 gives an overview and appraisal of relevant policy practices. The report ends up with conclusions and recommendations, presented as concrete perspectives for a good management of generations at work and pathways for more social cohesion...|$|E
40|$|Approaches {{based on}} viscous hydrodynamics for the hot and dense stage and hadronic {{transport}} {{for the final}} dilute rescattering stage are successfully applied to the dynamic description of heavy ion reactions at high beam energies. One crucial step in such hybrid approaches is the so called particlization, the transition between the hydrodynamic description to microscopic degrees of freedom. For this purpose, individual particles are sampled on the Cooper-Frye hypersurface. In this work, 4 different realizations of sampling algorithms are compared, where three of them incorporate global conservation laws of quantum numbers in each event. The algorithms are compared within two types of scenarios: simple "box" hypersurface consisting of only one static cell and a typical particlization hypersurface for Au+Au collisions at âˆš(s_NN) = 200 GeV. For all algorithms the mean multiplicities (or particle spectra) remain unaffected by global conservation laws {{in the case of}} large volumes. In contrast, the fluctuations of the particle numbers are affected considerably. The fluctuations of the newly developed <b>SPREW</b> algorithm based on exponential weights and the recently suggested SER algorithm based on ensemble rejection are smaller than without conservation laws and agree with the expectation from the canonical ensemble. The previously applied mode sampling algorithm produces dramatically larger fluctuations, than it is expected in the corresponding microcanonical ensemble, and therefore should be avoided in fluctuation studies. This study might be of interest for investigations of particle fluctuations and correlations, e. g. the suggested signatures for a phase transition or a critical endpoint, in hybrid approaches that are affected by global conservation laws.
