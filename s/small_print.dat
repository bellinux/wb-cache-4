5|$|Passing was {{published}} in April 1929 by Knopf in New York City. Sales of the book were modest: Knopf produced three <b>small</b> <b>print</b> runs each under 2,000 copies. While early reviews were primarily positive, it received little attention beyond New York City.|$|E
5|$|Detailed {{instructions}} in relatively <b>small</b> <b>print</b> for various technological devices appear at several {{points in the}} film, the most visible of which are the lengthy instructions for the zero-gravity toilet on the Aries Moon shuttle. Similar detailed instructions for replacing the explosive bolts also appear on the hatches of the E.V.A. pods, most visibly in closeup just before Bowman's pod leaves the ship to rescue Frank Poole.|$|E
5|$|Modern digital {{typography}} {{has reduced the}} costs of typesetting substantially, especially for <b>small</b> <b>print</b> runs. As long as a freely licensed Deseret alphabet font and a font of the standard orthography have similar inked surface areas, printing a book in the Deseret alphabet using modern technology would have a similar cost as printing a book in the standard orthography.|$|E
5000|$|The Salvatorian missionaries {{had started}} a <b>small</b> <b>printing</b> press at Laitkynsew (near Cherapunjee) in 1897. This <b>small</b> <b>printing</b> press was {{transferred}} to Shillong in the year 1907. In the same year a few Brothers {{of the society of}} the Divine Savior who were experts in carpentry, shoe-making and smithery, began instruction of young Khasi boys in these trades.|$|R

5|$|Some of the {{legislation}} is observed {{with high levels of}} compliance, but not uniformly throughout the country. There are not mandatory fines for smoking transgressions, although the newest 2016 anti-smoking campaign has seen fines issued and offenders threatened with images of them being broadcast on TV. Tobacco packaging warning messages are required on all types of packaging, but their appearance is not regulated in any way. They are usually printed in <b>small</b> <b>print</b> {{on the side of the}} package and only state that smoking is harmful to health. However, the descriptions must state the nicotine and tar content, must not be misleading and do need to be approved by local authorities. Graphic warning images that are now common worldwide have never appeared on packaging.|$|E
5|$|The {{books were}} {{relatively}} expensive to print, {{because of the}} Corbould and Finden illustrations, the images for the scientific volumes, {{and the use of}} Spottiswoode's printing house. In order to cut costs, the publishers decided to use <b>small</b> <b>print</b> and narrow margins. An estimated 4,000 copies of the first edition of the early volumes were printed, but the print run would probably have fallen to 2,500 since the sales did not pick up after 1835. As {{it became clear that the}} series was not going to take off, fewer review copies were sent out and advertisements became smaller. Lardner's interest in the project may also have waned, as he paid less attention to its business dealings. However, some volumes of the Cabinet Cyclopaedia remained in print until 1890.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{focuses on}} {{animation}} and includes several in-jokes about The Simpsons and the animation industry in general. In a scene depicting the Itchy & Scratchy writer's lounge, {{each of the}} writers shown is a caricature of someone working on The Simpsons at the time. The joke was conceived by the show's animators. Later in the episode, Roger Meyers fires a Harvard alumnus who resembles Simpsons writer Jon Vitti. At the awards ceremony, The Simpsons creator Matt Groening {{is shown in the}} audience. Lisa is also seen reading a book titled How to Get Rich Writing Cartoons by John Swartzwelder, a Simpsons writer credited with nearly sixty episodes of the show. The credits at the end of Bart and Lisa's Itchy & Scratchy episode (shown in very <b>small</b> <b>print)</b> are a copy of the credits at the end of The Simpsons.|$|E

5|$|Three {{publishers}} praised The Well {{but turned}} it down. Hall's agent then sent the manuscript to Jonathan Cape who, though cautious about publishing a controversial book, saw {{the potential for}} a commercial success. Cape tested the waters with a <b>small</b> <b>print</b> run of 1500 copies, priced at 15 shillings– about twice the cost of an average novel– to make it less attractive to sensation-seekers. Publication, originally scheduled for late 1928, was brought forward when he discovered that another novel with a lesbian theme, Compton Mackenzie's Extraordinary Women, was to be published in September. Though the two books proved to have little in common, Hall and Cape saw Extraordinary Women as a competitor and wanted to beat it to market. The Well appeared on 27 July, in a black cover with a plain jacket. Cape sent review copies only to newspapers and magazines he thought would handle the subject matter non-sensationally.|$|E

25|$|The {{composer}} and arranger George Williams {{has been cited}} in various biographies as having served as ghostwriter {{for the majority of}} arrangements heard on many of Gleason's albums of the 1950s and 1960s.

25|$|In 2006 17.2% of {{the comics}} {{released}} for the bookstore market were of European origin, in 2009 this ratio was 12.8% (the gross number of publications on the bookstore market grew 3 times between 2006 and 2009). Interestingly European comics constitute {{a substantial portion}} of the comics published for the alternative market: 36.2% of the comics on that particular market were of European origin in 2009. This is due to a large number of <b>small</b> <b>print</b> numbered, collector's editions of Mosaik books.|$|E
25|$|The UK Government {{introduced}} on 1 August 2008 regulations {{requiring the}} production of personal identification and vehicle registration documents when having number plates made by a retailer. The organisation that makes the plate is required to display their name and postcode, usually in <b>small</b> <b>print</b> at bottom centre, to aid in tracing false plates and their purchaser. This requirement was introduced in 2001 when the new character style and two-digit year identifier came into force, and applies to all registration plates made after that date regardless of {{the year of the}} vehicle.|$|E

25|$|Because of the clear, bold {{nature of}} the large serifs, slab serif designs are often used for posters and in <b>small</b> <b>print.</b> Many monospace fonts, on which all {{characters}} occupy {{the same amount of}} horizontal space as in a typewriter, are slab-serif designs. While not always purely slab-serif designs, many fonts intended for newspaper use have large slab-like serifs for clearer reading on poor-quality paper. Many early slab-serif types, being intended for posters, only come in bold styles with the key differentiation being width, and often have no lower-case letters at all.|$|E
25|$|Some typefaces are {{specifically}} designed to be printed at small sizes, for example in telephone directories or on newsprint paper. Bell Gothic and Bell Centennial, commissioned for telephone directories, are notable examples of this. Small-print designs often feature a large x-height, and a chunky design. Some fonts used at such sizes may be members of a larger typeface family joining members for normal sizes. For example, the Times New Roman family contains some designs intended for <b>small</b> <b>print</b> use, as do many families with optical sizes such as Minion.|$|E
25|$|Starting in the 20th century a new {{movement}} started with authors from Central Europe. In Lviv a small neo-romantic group of authors formed around the lyricist Schmuel Jankev Imber. <b>Small</b> <b>print</b> offices produced collections of modern poems and {{short stories and}} through emigration a large networkwas established. A second smaller group in the 1930s tried to create a connection between avantgarde art and Yiddish culture. Members of this group were Debora Vogel, Rachel Auerbach and Rachel Korn. The Holocaust destroyed this movement with Debora Vogel amongst many other Yiddish authors murdered by the Germans in the 1940s.|$|E
