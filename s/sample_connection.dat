One result of general importance is that measurements are indeed possible in real-scale reverberation rooms with turntables of 3 m diameter. There are only small differences between the real-scale and model-scale results.

40|$|Gas {{condition}} is {{of importance for}} operating industrial firing processes. Changing gas conditions, caused by a diversification of the natural gas purchase, affect combustion processes, the warmth brought into and subsequent production processes. Especially at sensitive thermal processing units a consequent adjustment of the burn attitudes is, with change of the natural gas condition, obligatory. The direct measurement of the gas condition ensures adjusting effects of variable gas conditions very fast and precisely. Thus consequent improvement advance the process and product quality. Currently available devices are mostly huge and expensive. Some inexpensive devices, which came to {{the market in the}} last years, measure only individual variables and are thereby not able to determine atypical gas compositions correctly. An answer to this problem enables the direct acquisition of clearly more gas constituents by using a MEMS analyser. Since large individual component determination of the natural gas components, disadvantages of existing systems will be avoid and the determination of a precise fuel value will be enabled. Core component of the system is a NIR-MEMS-spectrometer, which has been optimized for this purpose. The connection to the process is realized with a specific gas measuring cell.

Our approach (right) achieves much higher quality than bidirectional path-tracing {{on the left}} for the same computation time (~ 8. 4 min) [...] Abstract Bidirectional path tracing (BDPT) with Multiple Importance Sampling {{is one of the}} most versatile unbiased rendering algorithms today. BDPT repeatedly generates sub-paths from the eye and the lights, which are connected for each pixel and then discarded. Unfortunately, many such bidirectional connections turn out to have low contribution to the solution. Our key observation is that we can importance <b>sample</b> <b>connections</b> to an eye sub-path by considering multiple light sub-paths at once and creating connections probabilistically. We do this by storing light paths, and estimating probability mass functions of the discrete set of possible connections to all light paths. This has two key advantages: we efficiently create connections with low variance by Monte Carlo sampling, and we reuse light paths across different eye paths. We also introduce a caching scheme by deriving an approximation to sub-path contribution which avoids high-dimensional path distance computations. Our approach builds on caching methods developed in the different context of VPLs. Our Probabilistic Connections for Bidirectional Path Tracing approach raises a major challenge, since reuse results in high variance due to correlation between paths. We analyze the problem of path correlation and derive a conservative upper bound of the variance, with computationally tractable sample weights. We present results of our method which shows significant improvement over previous unbiased global illumination methods, and evaluate our algorithmic choices...|$|R

40|$|Conference ABSTRACT: In {{the early}} 20 th century, steel frame {{buildings}} were built to different standards from {{those used in}} modern construction. Riveted, built-up members were used instead of rolled sections, with joints and members encased in concrete for fire protection. These early steel buildings were designed based upon observations of past building performance rather than through detailed calculations and predictions of structural behaviour. The walls were infill masonry and floors were typically reinforced concrete. The strength and stiffness of the semi-rigid connections and masonry infill {{as well as the}} effect of floor slabs integral with their supporting beams are not well documented. Although riveted stiffened seat angle connections are not designed to resist moments, they can develop a considerable moment capacity and exhibit a relatively ductile hysteretic behaviour which could be beneficially considered when evaluating frames built of these connections and subjected to small and moderate earthquakes. Structural engineers have found it challenging to make realistic predictions of the seismic performance of these buildings, many which are quite prestigious, in full service and often enjoying heritage protection. Examples include Auckland’s Britomart Station and Guardian Trust Building, and Wellington’s Tower Corporation, Prudential Assurance and Hope-Gibbons Buildings. To predict the complicated behaviour of riveted connections, 3 D nonlinear finite element models of a <b>sample</b> clip-angle <b>connection</b> taken from drawings of the now-demolished Jean-Batten building in Auckland and a <b>sample</b> T-stub <b>connection</b> taken from drawings of the Hope-Gibbons building have been generated using the ABAQUS finite element software package.

40|$|There {{are growing}} demands to {{characterize}} the stability of assemblies of optical components for ultrahigh-precision instruments. In this paper we demonstrate how absolute length measurements by interferometry {{can be applied to}} measure the thermal and dimensional stability of connections. In order to enable investigation of common joining techniques, including wringing, screwing, and gluing, as well as specialized, inorganic joining techniques such as silicatic bonding, thin-film soldering, and solderjet bumping, representative connections were fabricated. By using gage blocks or prismatic bodies as joining parts, parallelism and flatness were provided which are needed for precision interferometric length measurements. The stability of connection elements used in ultrahigh-precision instruments was investigated longitudinally and laterally to the connection interface, and also mutual tilting of the parts was detected by analysis of the phase topographies. The measurements have an accuracy level of about 1 nm, and the traditional wringing method was also considered as a reference joining technique. The long-term behavior was studied within a period of about 1 year under constant temperature. Further, the thermal dilatation and the reaction of connections to thermal stress were measured. Results show that screwed connections do not exhibit a significant drift of length or orientation. They also did not show response to temperature variations of +/- 10 degrees C. This is different for adhesive connections, where dimensional changes of up to 100 nm were observed. The specimens produced by using thin-film soldering as well as silicatic bonding revealed stability of length better than 5 nm per year and angular stability within +/- 0. 1 arcsec. Furthermore, these specimens were shown to be insensitive to a temporary temperature variation in a range from 10 degrees C to 40 degrees C. This situation is slightly different for the <b>sample</b> <b>connections</b> produced by solderjet bumping, which show a positive length change of similar to 25 nm and a tilt of +/- 1 arcsec.
