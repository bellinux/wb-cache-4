60|$|After dinner, {{when we were}} alone, Lettie <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> nervously {{fingering}} her ring.|$|E
60|$|Smoke {{helped in}} loading the sled. Shorty <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> the cards laid before him for solitaire.|$|E
60|$|Ernshaw {{produced}} some books {{from his pocket}} and they <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b>|$|R
60|$|The old officer <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and hid {{his face}} in his hands.|$|R
60|$|The curtain {{closed behind}} her. Rudi and Klaus <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> still {{watching}} Hendricks.|$|R
60|$|At supper he <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> {{with the}} men, whose wet shirts showed how fierce {{the work of}} {{pitching}} the hay had been.|$|E
60|$|At dinner, Mr. Richard's party <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> next Basil's, {{and they}} were all now talking cheerfully over the {{emptiness}} of the spacious dining-hall.|$|E
60|$|Blakeney <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> {{with one}} arm resting on it, the {{emaciated}} hand tightly clutched, the body leaning forward, the eyes looking into nothingness.|$|E
60|$|As soon as {{they were}} alone they <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> and opened <b>the</b> deed.|$|R
60|$|The remark was {{unpleasant}} in its suggestion, but Tommy ignored it. He <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b>|$|R
60|$|Slowly old Jolyon got {{up out of}} his chair, and <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> to eat his dinner.|$|R
60|$|Louis {{advanced}} and {{bowed to the}} man who still <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> looking a little puzzled, and with his eyes still fixed upon Delora.|$|E
6000|$|Lord Fawn breakfasted at Fawn Court on the Monday, and {{his mother}} <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> with him, pouring out his tea. [...] "Oh, Frederic," [...] she said, [...] "it is so important!" ...|$|E
60|$|They <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> again, and Herman and Mattie {{tried to}} restore {{something}} of the brightness which had been lost. Allen sat grimly eating, his chin pushed down like a hog's snout.|$|E
60|$|Old man Ellison <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> kitchen <b>table,</b> {{having a}} tin cup of before-supper coffee. He looked {{contented}} and pleased.|$|R
60|$|So I {{asked her}} {{who were the}} men who had <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> long <b>table.</b> She became rather stiff and curt.|$|R
60|$|The florid woman {{brought him}} a chair, and he <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> as Endicott once more began to deal.|$|R
60|$|She leant {{forward over}} the table, staring blankly. But {{presently}} her half-averted face began to haunt {{me as she}} had <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> and her arm and the long droop of her shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|... "The food {{is not so}} bad if it {{were only}} served decently," [...] said Jennie, as they <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> eying the heavy china chipped and maimed in the savage process of washing.|$|E
60|$|The bishop <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> {{resting his}} arm upon it and {{awaiting}} the next {{development of this}} unsatisfactory interview. He {{was on the verge}} of asking as unpleasantly as possible when Brighton-Pomfrey would return.|$|E
60|$|Aaron <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> He ate {{and drank}} ravenously. He was, in fact, half starved but barely {{conscious}} of it.|$|R
60|$|Philip {{moved away}} from her. He <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and {{buried his face in}} his hands. He felt dreadfully humiliated.|$|R
60|$|He <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> again, {{and taking}} up his pen took some papers from a pigeon-hole and eyed them with severe thoughtfulness.|$|R
60|$|He {{thought of}} her as he <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> with George and his aged mother. They lived alone, and their lives were curiously silent. Once in a while a low-voiced question, and that was all.|$|E
60|$|Growing bolder, {{he turned}} {{the key in the}} lock, and {{cautiously}} opened the door for the space of several inches. Looking out, he saw that Churchley still <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> which was but a few feet away.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{were they}} very merry, and <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> a long time, talking of many things. Then {{said the old}} gentleman, My good landlord, while we are {{cracking}} your nuts, if you please, do you open this riddle:[234] ...|$|E
60|$|The skipper's {{daughter}} <b>sat</b> quietly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> selecting verses from a Biblical {{clock to}} amuse the ship's bosun, who {{was suffering from}} toothache.|$|R
60|$|Josephine <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> breakfast <b>table</b> {{long after}} David had gone out. She scowled <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sugar-bowl {{and shook her}} head savagely <b>at</b> <b>the</b> tea-pot.|$|R
60|$|Pescocalascio {{itself was}} crowded. The roads were sloppy with snow. But none the less, peasants in full dress, their feet soaked {{in the skin}} sandals, were trooping in the sun, purchasing, selling, {{bargaining}} for cloth, talking all the time. In the shop, which was also a sort of inn, an ancient woman was making coffee over a charcoal brazier, while a crowd of peasants <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> back, eating the food they had brought.|$|R
60|$|He then <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> with Roger Leybourn and his lady, who had {{recovered}} from her swoon, and behind {{them on the}} rushes of the floor lay the body of De Fulm in a little pool of blood.|$|E
60|$|Lenore bade {{the cowboy}} good-night {{and went to}} the sitting-room. Her mother sat preoccupied, with sad and {{thoughtful}} face. Rose was writing many pages to Jim. Kathleen <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> surreptitiously eating while she was pretending to read.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{were they}} very merry, and <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> a long time, talking of many things. Then {{said the old}} gentleman, [...] "My good landlord, while we are {{cracking}} your nuts, if you please, do you open this riddle; ...|$|E
60|$|He <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> and, {{squaring}} his shoulders, took a noisy dip of ink, and {{scratching his}} head, looked pensively <b>at</b> <b>the</b> paper.|$|R
60|$|Pressing {{his hand}} to his bewildered head, Darnay <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> Carton, with his right hand in his breast, stood close beside him.|$|R
60|$|Actuated by one impulse, Hough and Durade <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> <b>The</b> others crowded around. Fresno lurched close, with {{a wicked}} gleam in his eyes.|$|R
