50|$|<b>Skin</b> <b>popping</b> is any {{of several}} routes of {{administration}} whereby street drugs are injected or deposited under the skin. It {{is usually a}} depot injection, either subcutaneous or intradermal, although the term is rarely (and inaccurately) applied to intramuscular injection. After deposition, the drug then diffuses slowly from the depot into the capillary networks, where it enters circulation. <b>Skin</b> <b>popping</b> is distinct from intravenous injection in that the latter deposits the drug directly into the bloodstream via a vein. Higher-potency prescription opioids, such as morphine, fentanyl, or meperidine can be injected subcutaneously, as can cocaine. <b>Skin</b> <b>popping</b> increases {{the duration of the}} high one gets from drugs such as cocaine. The sites where <b>skin</b> <b>popping</b> with cocaine has been performed have an area of central pallor surrounded by bruising (ecchymosis). This pattern is due to the vasoconstrictive properties of cocaine acting locally at the injection site with hemorrhage occurring in the surrounding tissue. <b>Skin</b> <b>popping</b> puts one at risk for developing secondary amyloid associated (AA) amyloidosis. Tetanus has also been associated with skin-popping as has botulism.|$|E

40|$|The {{most common}} routes of cocaine abuse are by inhalation, {{snorting}} and intravenous injection. Cocaine skin inoculation is rare and itâ€™s used to ovoid track marks or when peripheral veins are sclerosed and the addict, unable to access a peripheral vein, injects substance by mistake or deliberately, in subcutaneous tissue and muscle. Deliberate subcutaneous injection (<b>skin</b> <b>popping)</b> {{is also used}} to avoid track marks which represent stigmata of drug addiction...|$|E
40|$|Drug {{abuse is}} a serious problem, both {{globally}} and at a local level, with more than 13, 400 opiate abusers in Dublin, Ireland, alone. Infectious complications are responsible for 60 - 80 per cent of hospital admissions of IV drug users. In 2000, in the United Kingdom and Ireland, fatalities associated with soft-tissue inflammation and severe systemic sepsis were linked to 'skin popping' (injection of drugs into the skin and subcutaneous tissues rather than directly into a vein). Clostridium species were implicated in the pathogenesis. Superficial infection may progress to more widespread local or distant disease. Primary soft-tissue infections in IV drug users include cellulitis, abscess, myositis, pyomyositis, and necrotizing fasciitis. Secondary effects of IV drug use include septic arthritis and tenosynovitis, secondary osteomyelitis, vascular complications, soft-tissue ulceration, and fistula formation. In this review, the range of complications caused by <b>skin</b> <b>popping</b> that may develop will be shown. Early imaging to define disease extent and complications is important because clinical deterioration can be precipitous...|$|E

50|$|Levko goes {{on his own}} {{and falls}} asleep near the old house and the pond. He becomes enchanted by the calm night and silvery mist {{surrounding}} everything, and then notices in the pond's reflection that the hut appears to be occupied, and a young girl with beautiful <b>skin</b> <b>pops</b> her head out of the window. When he turns to look at the hut, it looks as empty as ever, but when he comes up to the window the maiden comes out and asks him to guess which maiden the witch is in the group. As he looks at them, he notices one at first that doesn't seem interested in playing games, but determines her to be normal. One, however, seems to revel in playing the part of a hawk in their game, and he sees blackness in her form, realising she is the witch. The maiden is grateful and gives him a note to help him with his father. He wakes up and is soon captured by his father and his minions, but still has the letter, which he gives to the mayor. The letter seems to be from the local commissar, who requests the mayor clean up his village (asking several things to be done) as well as allowing his son to marry Hanna. The mayor agrees and they will be married in the near future.|$|R
40|$|Having {{identified}} key {{determinants of}} teaching and learning spinal anesthesia, it was necessary to characterize and render the haptic sensations (feeling of touch) associated with needle insertion in the lower back. The approach used is to match recreated sensations (eg, "pop" through skin or dura mater) with experts' perceptions of the equivalent clinical events. The study was performed using a haptic device (Phantom Desktop) that simulated the tactile elements of predefined clinical events. Twenty-four experts (anesthetists) were invited to assess rendered versions of 3 basic sensations, which typically occur during the performance of spinal anesthesia with a 25 -gauge pencil point needle: (1) touching different surfaces (skin, bone), (2) the "pop" sensations (skin, dura mater), and (3) the sensations associated with advancement of the spinal needle through particular tissues (subcutaneous tissue, ligaments, intrathecal space). The perceptions of each participant were recorded. The relationships between each rendered sensation and the corresponding participant's perception was modeled using standard random effects techniques. Experts seem to possess a specific haptic perception regarding most sensations. The coefficient of variation was less than 0. 50 for all sensations with the exception of intrathecal space. However, there is considerable within-rater variation when experts are presented with the same haptic rendering {{on more than one occasion}} for bone surface, <b>skin</b> <b>pop,</b> dura pop, and subcutaneous tissue. The importance of this finding is that it demonstrates the feasibility of an "expert perception"-based approach to the design of medical simulators...|$|R

40|$|We used atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM) {{to diagnose}} pathological changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of skin connective tissue in patients with pelvic organ prolapse (POP). POP is a common condition affecting women that considerably decreases the patients' quality of life. Deviations from normal morphology of the skin ECM from patients with POP occur including packing and arrangement of individual collagen fibers and arrangement of collagen fibrils. The nanoindentation study revealed significant deterioration of the mechanical properties of collagen fibril bundles in the <b>skin</b> of <b>POP</b> patients {{as compared with the}} skin of healthy subjects. Changes in the skin ECM appeared to correlate well with changes in the ECM of the pelvic ligament tissue associated with POP. AFM data on the ECM structure of normal and pathologically altered connective tissue were in agreement with results of the standard histological study on the same clinical specimens. Thus, AFM and related techniques may serve as independent or complementary diagnostic tools for tracking POP-related pathological changes of connective tissue. 10 page(s...|$|R
2500|$|The band's {{second album}} Live Through This, {{captured}} a less abrasive sound, {{while maintaining the}} group's original punk roots. [...] "I want this record to be shocking {{to the people who}} don't think we have a soft edge, and at the same time, [...] that we haven't lost our very, very hard edge," [...] Love told VH1 in 1994. The group's third album, Celebrity <b>Skin,</b> incorporated power <b>pop</b> into their hard rock sound, and was heavily inspired by California bands; Love was also influenced by Fleetwood Mac and My Bloody Valentine while writing the album. The group's 2010 release, Nobody's Daughter, featured a more folk rock-oriented sound, utilizing acoustic guitar and softer melodies.|$|R
40|$|Persistent organic {{pollutants}} (POPs) pose serious threats to human health. Increasing {{attention has been}} paid to POPs to protect the environment and prevent disease. Humans are exposed to POPs through diet (the major route), inhaling air and dust and <b>skin</b> contact. <b>POPs</b> are very lipophilic and hydrophobic, meaning that they accumulate in fatty tissues in animals and can biomagnify. Humans can therefore be exposed to relatively high POP concentrations in food of animal origin. Cooking animal products can decrease the POP contents, and different cooking methods achieve different reduction rates. Here, a consensus decision-making model with interval preference relations is used to prioritize cooking methods for specific animal products in terms of reducing POP concentrations. Two consistency mathematical expressions (I-consistency and I I -consistency) are defined, then the ideal interval preference relations are determined for the cooking methods with respect to different social choice principles. The objective is to minimize disparities between individual judgments and the ideal consensus judgment. Consistency is used as a constraint to determine the rationality of the consistency definitions. A numerical example indicated that baking is the best cooking method for decreasing POP concentrations in grass carp. The I-consistency results were more acceptable than the I I -consistency results...|$|R
