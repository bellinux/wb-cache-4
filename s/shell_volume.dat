40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze {{the laws of}} growth that control planktic foraminiferal shell morpholoy. We assume that {{isometry}} is the key towards the understanding of their ontogeny. Hence, our "null hypothesis" is that these organisms construct isometric shells. To test this hypothesis, geometric models of their shells have been generated with a personal computer. It is demonstrated that early chambers in log-spirally coiled structures can not follow a strict isometric arrangement. In the real world, the centres of juvenile chambers deviate from the logarithmic growth curve. Juvenile stages are generally more planispiral and contain more chambers per whorl than adult stages. These traits are shown to be essential {{in order to keep}} volumes of consecutive chambers in geometric progression. We are convinced that the neanic stage marks the constructional bridge from a juvenile set of growth parameters to an adult one. The adult stage can be strictly isometric, i. e. the effective shape is constant and the increase in volume after a chamber addition is proportional to the preexisting volume of the shell. The <b>shell</b> <b>volume</b> is related to the biomass, the ratio of outer shell surface area to <b>shell</b> <b>volume</b> is related to the respiration-rate and the ratio of the total shell surface area to <b>shell</b> <b>volume</b> is related to the total calcification effort. The influence of the parameters of the model on these relationships are investigated. Only, the initial radius and the rate of radius increase affect the relationships between <b>shell</b> <b>volume</b> and surface area. The other shape parameters only provide a fine tune up of these relationships. Size itself plays a major role during foraminiferal development...|$|E
30|$|The {{outer shell}} was {{segmented}} using a spherical volume aligned to the CT data, with the sphere diameter {{set to be}} the physical diameter of the external surface {{of the outer shell}} plus 10  mm. The VOI of the inner sphere was then subtracted from the VOI of the external surface of the outer shell to obtain the data for the shell. The arbitrary expansion of the region of interest by 10  mm in each direction is the standard clinical protocol at this site as it is felt that this will allow for correction for spill-out due to partial volume effects.

40|$|Abstract Background Tomographic imaging has {{revealed}} that the body mass index does not give a reliable state of overall fitness. However, high measurement costs make the tomographic imaging unsuitable for large scale studies or repeated individual use. This paper reports an experimental investigation of a new electromagnetic method and its feasibility for assessing body composition. The method is called body electrical loss analysis (BELA). Methods The BELA method uses a high-Q parallel resonant circuit to produce a time-varying magnetic field. The Q of the resonator changes when the sample is placed in its coil. This is caused by induced eddy currents in the sample. The new idea in the BELA method is the altered spatial distribution of the electrical losses generated by these currents. The distribution of losses is varied using different excitation frequencies. The feasibility of the method was tested using simplified phantoms. Two of these phantoms were rough estimations of human torso. One had fat {{in the middle of}} its volume and saline solution in the outer <b>shell</b> <b>volume.</b> The other had reversed conductivity distributions. The phantoms were placed in the resonator and the change in the losses was measured. Five different excitation frequencies from 100 kHz to 200 kHz were used. Results The rate of loss as a function of frequency was observed to be approximately three times larger for a phantom with fat in the middle of its volume than for one with fat in its outer <b>shell</b> <b>volume.</b> Conclusions At higher frequencies the major signal contribution can be shifted toward outer <b>shell</b> <b>volume.</b> This enables probing the conductivity distribution of the subject by weighting outer structural components. The authors expect that the loss changing rate over frequency can be a potential index for body composition analysis. </p...|$|E
40|$|This work {{introduces}} {{a new technique}} for real-time rendering of arbitrary volumetric geometry into a polygonal mesh’s shell space. The shell space is a layer of variable thickness on top or below the polygonal mesh. The technique computes view ray shell geometry intersections in a pixel shader. In addition to arbitrary volumetric shell geometry, represented as volume textures, it can handle also the less general case of height-field shell geometry. To minimize the number of ray tracing steps, a 3 D distance map is used for skipping empty space in the <b>shell</b> <b>volume.</b> The <b>shell</b> <b>volume</b> is defined by a pre-computed tetrahedra mesh. The tetrahedra subdivide prisms extruded from the polygonal base mesh. A vertex shader computes tetrahedron face plane distances for generating the per-pixel tetrahedron thickness using non-linear interpolation. The technique includes local lighting and overcomes shortcomings of previous shell space rendering approaches such as high storage requirements and involved per-vertex computations [Wang et al. 2004] or low shell geometry depth complexity and mapping distortions [Policarpo and Oliveira 2006]. Additionally, rendering artifacts for shallow view angles common to many related techniques are reduced. Furthermore, methods for generating a geometry volume texture and the corresponding distance map from a polygonal mesh are presented...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the hydration structure and water/ion dynamics about complex anions using a revised {{platinum group metal}} chloro-anion force field. Nanosecond atomistic molecular dynamics simulations were performed for the platinum group metal chloro-anion complexes. This investigation makes the first attempt at describing diffusion trends of polyatomic complex anions with counterions such as these using both hydrodynamic and dielectric friction properties of the anion solution. The transition metal anion complex diffusion rates are shown to be correlated to their first solvent shell radial distribution function peaks, their mean water residence times, and their solvation volumes as calculated by Voronoi tessellation of the simulation cell. The general trend is for slower diffusion rates to result from larger hydration <b>shell</b> <b>volumes.</b> This diffusion rate trend calculated from Stokes’ law is best described using the solventberg approach with well-chosen effective solvated radii.

Depending on the thickness of Ag shell deposited on the Au nanorod surface, there is a blue shift on the longitudinal surface plasmon band of Au nanorods, which can be expressed by an approximate formula derived from the absorption profile of light in Ag films using finite difference time domain simulations.

40|$|Inter- and intra-specific genetically and phenotypically {{determined}} {{variations in}} snail morphological features are well documented.

Using bi - and tridimensional data processing, statistical, and biochemical analyses we assessed the cumulated actions of environmental factors on intra - variety changes of shell morphological features in relation to origin area. Formula proposed for shell tri-dimensional processing (<b>shell</b> <b>volume)</b> provided a reliable and faster method to assess variations among shell height, width, and depth than the multiple analyses of each feature apart. Similarly, aperture bi-dimensional processing (aperture area) successfully replaced the separated statistical analyses of aperture height and depth. Most biometric features, excepting shell thickness, presented a linked and proportional pattern among themselves. In addition, the sense of these relationships (direct or converse proportional) for shell height, width, and depth seemed to vary depending on location. We demonstrated that <b>shell</b> <b>volume</b> and aperture area tend to be larger in areas with higher annual rainfall level, altitude, and mean average temperature.

40|$|Brachiopods have {{commonly}} {{been considered}} {{more important than}} bivalves in Paleozoic ecosystems due to their greater global diversity and greater abundance in many fossil assemblages. New sampling-standardized diversity curves verify that brachiopods were more diverse than bivalves {{at the global level}} in the Paleozoic; they declined in the Permian-Triassic extinction, largely recovered, then faded away later in the Mesozoic. However, the subordinate ecological status of bivalves within local Paleozoic ecosystems has been challenged on two fronts. First, bivalve abundance may be underestimated due to preferential dissolution of aragonitic shells. Second, bivalve contribution to ecosystem function may be underestimated by abundance or diversity data because they tend to have greater biomass and energy use than brachiopods. Here, I compare the relative importance of bivalves and brachiopods in an exceptionally preserved fauna from the Middle Pennsylvanian Breathitt Formation of Kentucky in which aragonitic bivalves are preserved as shells, not molds. I use four metrics of ecological importance – abundance, <b>shell</b> <b>volume,</b> biomass and energy use. Brachiopods outnumbered bivalves and had greater total <b>shell</b> <b>volume,</b> though the two taxa were roughly equivalent in total biomass and energy use. By all four metrics, brachiopods were more important as suspension feeders. The importance of brachiopods relative to bivalves was underestimated when occurrence-level data were used instead of abundance data, suggesting caution in interpreting global trends based on occurrences. Globally, the two taxa were fairly similar in diversity in the Pennsylvanian, so brachiopods may have been more important relative to bivalves at other times in the Paleozoic when their diversity was greater...|$|E

40|$|In a {{hermetic}} {{reciprocating compressor}} the suction pressure pulsations affect compressor performance and noise. The pressure pulsations are created {{due to the}} dynamic flow of refrigerant through the suction valve into the cylinder bore. One dimensional (1 D) acoustic method, Finite Element Method (FEM) calculated impedance transfer matrix method, and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) are three commonly used methods to calculate these pressure pulsations. With CFD being used most often to solve this type of analysis; however CFD is often time consuming and requires significant computer resources. In order to solve the pressure pulsation analyses faster, the suction plenum geometry is often simplified by reducing the model size. This simplification could lead to inaccuracies in pressure pulsation modeling. This paper will use the FEM calculated impedance transfer matrix method to analyze a hermetic HVAC reciprocating compressor to show that geometry simplifications could result in poor predictions of pressure pulsation. The FEM calculated impedance transfer matrix method was chosen due to its short solution time and the inherent ability to compare similarities and differences in the plenum’s impedances between the full model which includes volume inside the compressor shell, and a simplified model. This paper will specifically look at {{the influence of the}} compressor <b>shell</b> <b>volume</b> on simulating suction pressure pulsations.

This study examines the effects of soil type and adult size (<b>shell</b> <b>volume)</b> on mating propensity and female and male reproductive output (number and mass of eggs, number of sperm delivered and spermatophore mass) in individuals of the simultaneous hermaphrodite land snail Arianta arbustorum from two populations kept both on calcium-(Ca-) rich and Ca-poor soil. Snails from the two populations differed in adult size, relative shell growth, mating propensity and egg size. Furthermore, in both populations the number of egg batches deposited, egg size and spermatophore size scaled allometrically with <b>shell</b> <b>volume,</b> but not the total number of eggs produced and number of sperm delivered. Independent of population and shell size, the type of soil on which the snails were maintained influenced mating propensity, the total number of eggs produced and the mass of the albumen gland (another measure of female reproductive output). The mating propensity was higher and the total number of eggs produced was larger in snails kept on Ca-poor soil than in individuals reared on Ca-rich soil. This surprising finding could be {{explained by the fact that}} the Ca-poor soil used in the experiment still contained enough Ca to allow reproduction, and that the snails ingested Ca through the food consumed (lettuce grown on Ca-rich soil was available ad libitum). Moreover, the Ca-rich soil could contain minerals or (unknown) substances which discourage reproduction in A. arbustorum. Our study highlights the complexities faced when interpreting differences in the life history of gastropods.

Animals were fixed in 10 % formalin and transported to the laboratory where they were weighed and measured for cephalothoracic shield length (CSL) and width, left propodus length and height. Gastropod shells species were identified, weighed and measured for shell aperture width and length and <b>shell</b> internal <b>volume.</b> A total of 391 individuals were collected (219 females, 172 males) and were found occupying ten shell species, with clear significant occupation of Nerita undata.

Analysis of <b>shell</b> internal <b>volume</b> and crab dimensions demonstrated that this shell dimension constitutes mainly the determinant for C. scaevola shell utilization.
