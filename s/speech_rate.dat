5|$|Parkinson's {{disease is}} a {{progressive}} neurological condition in which dysarthria may develop later in the progression of the disease. Some individuals eventually lose all functional speech. AAC approaches are generally used to supplement and support natural speech. A portable amplifier, for example, {{may be used to}} increase the volume of speech and thus its intelligibility. The individual may be taught to point to the first letter of each word they say on an alphabet board, leading to a reduced <b>speech</b> <b>rate</b> and visual cues for the listener to compensate for impaired articulation. Entire words can be spelled out if necessary. In users that have reduced range and speed of movement, a smaller than usual selection display may be preferred. High-tech AAC keyboard speech-generating devices are also used; keyguards may be required to prevent accidental keystrokes caused by the tremor typical of the disease. Factors affecting AAC use in Parkinson's disease include motor deficits and cognitive changes; the latter may result in unawareness of their problems with spoken communication.|$|E
25|$|<b>Speech</b> <b>rate</b> {{is closely}} related to {{cognitive}} load of speakers as well. Depending on the cognitive load, the rates of a speaker's utterances are produced either faster or slower, in comparison to a fixed speaking rate which happens usually. For example, <b>speech</b> <b>rate</b> becomes slower when having to make choices that are not anticipated, and tend to accelerate when words are being repeated.|$|E

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{indicated}} a general decrease in speed and accuracy of speech output in older compared to younger speakers. In a previous study investigating reiterated productions of syllables /pa/, /sa/ and /ta/ at different <b>speech</b> <b>rates,</b> we found that older adults when slowing down, more prominently increased duration and decreased peak velocity in closing movements compared to younger adults. As a possible explanation we proposed that older adults may evidence a mechanism that facilitates a closed loop control system to maintain movement stability, possibly due to a reduced quality of somatosensory input. In the present study, we examined this phenomenon further using a reiterated speech task with target words /a:pi/ and /ipa:/, which regarding jaw and lips, involve three-step movement schemes consisting respectively of one closing and two opening movements and two closing and one opening movement. Eight young adults and eight elderly speakers participated in the study. Articulographic data were collected on the reiterated productions of the target words at self-paced slow, habitual and fast <b>speech</b> <b>rates,</b> and {{in a series of}} metronome guided <b>speech</b> <b>rates</b> ranging from 2 to 4 syllables per second.

25|$|Despite {{the great}} variety of {{different}} speakers and different conditions, listeners perceive vowels and consonants as constant categories. It has been proposed that this is achieved {{by means of the}} perceptual normalization process in which listeners filter out the noise (i.e. variation) to arrive at the underlying category. Vocal-tract-size differences result in formant-frequency variation across speakers; therefore a listener has to adjust his/her perceptual system to the acoustic characteristics of a particular speaker. This may be accomplished by considering the ratios of formants rather than their absolute values. This process has been called vocal tract normalization (see Figure 3 for an example). Similarly, listeners are believed to adjust the perception of duration to the current tempo of the speech they are listening to – this has been referred to as <b>speech</b> <b>rate</b> normalization.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} salient {{differences}} between European and Brazilian Portuguese is their prosody. European Portuguese is a stress-timed language, with reduction, devoicing or even deletion of unstressed vowels and a general tolerance of syllable-final consonants. Brazilian Portuguese, on the other hand, is of mixed characteristics, and varies according to <b>speech</b> <b>rate,</b> sex and dialect. At fast speech rates, Brazilian Portuguese is more stress-timed, while in slow speech rates, it can be more syllable-timed. The accents of rural, southern Rio Grande do Sul and the Northeast (especially Bahia) are considered to sound more syllable-timed than the others, while the southeastern dialects such as the mineiro, in central Minas Gerais, the paulistano, of the northern coast and eastern regions of São Paulo, and the fluminense, along Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo and eastern Minas Gerais as well the Federal District, are most frequently essentially stress-timed. Also, male speakers of Brazilian Portuguese speak faster than female speakers and speak in a more stress-timed manner, and with a lighter reduction of unstressed vowels, less raising of pre-stress vowels, less devoicing and fewer deletions.|$|E

2500|$|One {{important}} factor that causes variation is differing <b>speech</b> <b>rate.</b> Many phonemic contrasts are constituted by temporal characteristics (short vs. long vowels or consonants, affricates vs. fricatives, plosives vs. glides, voiced vs. voiceless plosives, etc.) {{and they are}} certainly affected by changes in speaking tempo. Another major source of variation is articulatory carefulness vs. sloppiness which is typical for connected speech (articulatory [...] "undershoot" [...] is obviously reflected in the acoustic properties of the sounds produced).|$|E
2500|$|Speech {{language}} pathologists {{teach people}} who stutter {{to control and}} monitor {{the rate at which}} they speak. In addition, people may learn to start saying words in a slightly slower and less physically tense manner. They may also learn to control or monitor their breathing. When learning to control <b>speech</b> <b>rate,</b> people often begin by practising smooth, fluent speech at rates that are much slower than typical speech, using short phrases and sentences. Over time, people learn to produce smooth speech at faster rates, in longer sentences, and in more challenging situations until speech sounds both fluent and natural. When treating stuttering in children, some researchers recommend that an evaluation be conducted every three months in order {{to determine whether or not}} the selected treatment option is working effectively. [...] "Follow-up" [...] or [...] "maintenance" [...] sessions are often necessary after completion of formal intervention to prevent relapse.|$|E
5000|$|L2 <b>speech</b> <b>rate</b> is {{typically}} slower than native speech. For example, Mandarin Chinese speakers’ <b>speech</b> <b>rate</b> in an English utterance is slower than native English speakers’ <b>speech</b> <b>rate</b> (Derwing and Munro, 1995), and speech rates {{in a sentence}} by highly experienced Italian and Korean nonnative speakers of English are slower than that of native English speakers' (Guion et al., 2000). In this study, the main factor of the slower <b>speech</b> <b>rate</b> for the Italian and Korean accented English was the durations of the vowels and sonorant consonants (Guion et al., 2000). Another source of the slower <b>speech</b> <b>rate</b> in L2 speech is that L2 speakers tend to not reduce function words, such as [...] "the" [...] or [...] "and," [...] as much as native speakers (Aoyama and Guion, 2007). The generally slower <b>speech</b> <b>rate</b> in L2 speech is correlated with the degree of perceived foreign accent by native listeners (Derwing and Munro, 1997).|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} if combining delayed auditory feedback (DAF) and frequency altered feedback (FAF) would be more fluency enhancing than either DAF or FAF alone. Ten stutterers read at normal and fast <b>speech</b> <b>rates</b> under nonaltered auditory feedback (NAF), DAF (i. e., a 50 ms delay), FAF (i. e., a one half octave downward shift), and a combination of DAF and FAF [(COMBO), i. e., a 50 ms delay plus a one half octave downward shift]. Results indicated that stuttering frequency was significantly reduced under all altered auditory conditions at both <b>speech</b> <b>rates</b> relative to the NAF condition. There was, however, no significant differences between the altered auditory feedback conditions (i. e., DAF, FAF, and COMBO). It is suggested that further studies be undertaken to explore the combination of altered auditory feedback conditions, as it may be the case that a floor effect was demonstrated with the singular presentations of DAF and FAF and further improvements in fluency enhancement could not be exhibited in the combined condition. Finally, these findings support the notion that a slowed <b>rate</b> of <b>speech</b> is not necessary for fluency enhancement under conditions of altered auditory feedback...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the occurrence of}} semantic, phonological and syntactic deficits in acute aphasia with the ScreeLing after the establishment of its psychometric properties. To {{examine the relationship between}} these deficits and: (i) overall aphasia severity; and (ii) quality of Spontaneous Speech. Methods: The reliability and validity of the ScreeLing was established by investigating 141 subjects with acute aphasia (2 weeks after stroke), 23 with chronic aphasia, and 138 healthy controls. In addition, the acute patients were assessed with the Token Test and a Spontaneous <b>Speech</b> <b>rating</b> (Aphasia Severity Rating Scale). Results: The ScreeLing was found to be valid and reliable for assessing the presence and severity of aphasia and linguistic deficits at 12 days after stroke. In 22. 4 % of the patients deficits were found in only 1 of the 3 linguistic levels; phonology was most frequently disturbed (16. 3 %), compared with semantics (2. 7 %), and syntax (3. 4 %). The number of impaired linguistic levels was related to aphasia severity: patients with a 3 -level disorder had the lowest Token Test scores; patients with a selective phonological disorder had the highest Spontaneous Speech ratings. Phonology alone explained 54. 6 % {{of the variance in the}} Spontaneous <b>Speech</b> <b>rating.</b> Conclusion: In the acute stage, linguistic-level deficits are already present independently of each other, with phonology affected most frequently...|$|R
