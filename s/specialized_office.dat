500|$|Nevado del Ruiz has erupted {{several times}} since the disaster, and {{continues}} to threaten up to 500,000people living along the Combeima, Chinchina, Coello-Toche, and Guali river valleys. A lahar (or group of lahars) similar in size to the 1985 event could potentially travel as far as [...] from the volcano, and could be triggered by a small eruption. To counter this threat, the Colombian government established a <b>specialized</b> <b>office</b> which promotes awareness of natural threats. The United States Geological Survey also created the Volcano Disaster Assistance Program and the Volcano Crisis Assistance Team, which evacuated roughly 75,000people from the area around Mount Pinatubo before its 1991 eruption. In 1988, {{three years after the}} eruption, Dr. Stanley Williams of Louisiana State University stated that, [...] "With the possible exception of Mount St. Helens in the state of Washington, no other volcano in the Western Hemisphere is being watched so elaborately" [...] as Nevado del Ruiz. Additionally, many of Colombia's cities have programs to raise awareness of natural disaster planning programs which have helped save lives in natural disasters. Near Nevado del Ruiz in particular, locals have become wary of volcanic activity: when the volcano erupted in 1989, more than 2,300people living around it were evacuated.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Dental wastes due {{to having}} {{bacterial}} disease-causing agents and toxic chemicals are categorized in hazardous wastes. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the quantity and composition of dental waste produced by general and <b>specialized</b> dental <b>offices</b> in babol city. Materials &Methods: From all dental offices (170 and 40 dental offices were related to general and specialized respectively) in Babol city, 20 general and 5 <b>specialized</b> <b>offices</b> were randomly selected. Waste samples were collected three times a week (Sunday, Monday and Tuesday), 50 sub-groups were separated and weighted by a digital scale with accuracy of 0. 01 gram. The data were presented by excel and word software in figures and tables. Results: The total wastes of general and <b>specialized</b> <b>offices</b> were 11829 and 2831. 5 kg/year, respectively. The percentages of domestic-type, infectious, pharmaceutical and toxic wastes in general dental offices were 52. 5 %, 42. 5 %, 4. 7 % and 0. 3 %; and in <b>specialized</b> <b>offices</b> were 42. 5 %, 50 %, 7 % and 0. 5 %, respectively. Most components in a variety of dental waste included plastic, paper, plaster molds, glass and metal. Conclusion: Due to the large contents of plastic, paper, plaster molds, glass and metals in domestic- type and infectious wastes produced in the general and <b>specialized</b> dental <b>offices,</b> it is necessary to manage the wastes and their separation and recycling in source place...|$|R

50|$|Community of Christ has {{a largely}} {{volunteer}} priesthood, and {{all members of}} the priesthood are free to marry (as traditionally defined by the Christian community). The priesthood is divided into two orders, the Aaronic priesthood and the Melchisedec priesthood. The Aaronic order consists of the offices of deacon, teacher and priest. The Melchisedec Order consists of the offices of elder (including the <b>specialized</b> <b>office</b> of seventy) and high priest (including the specialized offices of evangelist, bishop, apostle, & prophet). Paid ministers include “appointees” and the general officers of the church, which include some specialized priesthood offices (such as the office of president, reserved for the three top members of the church leadership team). As of 1984, women have been eligible for priesthood, which is conferred through the sacrament of ordination by the laying-on-of-hands. While there is technically no age requirement for any office of priesthood, there is no automatic ordination or progression as in the LDS Church. Young people are occasionally ordained as deacon, and sometimes teacher or priest, but generally most priesthood members are called following completion of post secondary school education. In March 2007 a woman was ordained {{for the first time to}} the office of president.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, the Québec {{government}} has introduced new measures that significantly reinforce frameworks for both water protection and agricultural activities. In late 2002, it adopted the Québec Water Policy, which undertakes {{to introduce a}} watershed-based management strategy for cleaning up watercourses and intensify agricultural clean-up efforts. Agricultural policies have also been undergoing important transformations in Québec {{over the past few}} years. The Regulation Respecting Agricultural Operations has reinforced controls over agricultural pollution while the policy directions for the sustainable development of hog farming, adopted in 2004, has led to the implementation of new measures and requirements favouring the integration of sustainable development principles in pig farming. These changes were legitimized by extensive public consultations conducted by a <b>specialized</b> <b>office</b> for public hearings on the environment, the Bureau d'audiences publiques sur l'environnement (BAPE). Through these consultations, BAPE provided advice and recommendations to guide government decision making with a view to sustainable development. It held comprehensive public hearings on water management in 1999 – 2000 and on sustainable development for hog farming in 2002 – 2003. These two consultation processes were the key events on which current reforms are based, and they have contributed to meeting the challenge of reconciling water and agricultural policies...|$|E
40|$|Background: Acne vulgaris is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} {{disease of the}} pilosebaceous units, which chiefly involves face and {{upper part of the}} trunk. Its prevalence is highest in adolescence, where the individual counters several psychosocial changes. Depression, suicidal thoughts, and low self esteem are reported in the patients with this disease. Aim: The goal {{of this study is to}} compare prevalence of anxiety and depression in the patients with acne vulgaris and normal population. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 82 patients with acne vulgaris and 82 persons without acne who referred to a dermatology clinic and a <b>specialized</b> <b>office</b> for skin diseases in Rasht were studied. Anxiety and depression were evaluated by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire and severity of acne was evaluated by Global Acne Grading System (GAGS). Data were analyzed by SPSS ver. 14. 0 software, independent T-test, multi variate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) and chi-square test for comparison the quantitative and ordinal data, respectively; with &# 945;= 0. 05. Results: Prevalence of anxiety and mean of anxiety scores were 68. 3 &#x 0025; and 9. 17 &# 177; 3. 52, respectively, in patients group and 39. 1 &#x 0025; and 7. 10 &# 177; 3. 07, respectively, in control group in which there was a significant difference (P = 0. 001).
