The changing nature of information technology means that {{teachers need to be}} flexible in how they use information technology in their teaching, adaptable to the changes in technological developments, problem solvers in unfamiliar circumstances, and continuing learners throughout their professional life. These ideas are encapsulated in the concept of fluency with information technology, or FITness (Committee on Information Technology Literacy, 1999). This research study, in progress, uses an interpretive, qualitative methodological approach to investigate the influence of <b>self</b> <b>regulated</b> learning on the development of fluency with information technology in pre-service teacher education students. This will provide opportunities for {{a better understanding of the}} phenomenon of <b>self</b> <b>regulated</b> learning as an influence within the context of learning FITness, and will assist our understanding of the connections between instruction (using <b>self</b> <b>regulated</b> learning) and outcomes (FITness) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} was conducted as {{there was a difference}} between learning achievement of the students in regular class and in training class. Learning motivation, learning skill quality and <b>self</b> <b>regulated</b> learning are factors assumed to affect the students’ learning achievement. This {{research was}} intended to: (1) reveal the difference between learning motivation of the students in regular class and in training class, (2) the difference between learning skill quality of the students in regular class and in training class, and (3) <b>self</b> <b>regulated</b> learning of the students in regular class and in training class. This research applied descriptive comparative method. The population of the research was 312 students in class XI of SMA N 5 Padang. By using purposive sampling technique and simple random sampling technique, 65 students were chosen as the sample. The instrument of the research were learning motivation questionnaire (the reliability was 0. 950), <b>self</b> <b>regulated</b> learning questionnaire (the reliability was 0. 817), and AUM PTSDL Format SLTA (the reliability was 0. 76). The data gathered then were analyzed by using Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA). The research findings indicated that: (1) learning motivation of the students both in training class and in regular class at SMA N 5 Padang was in high category, (2) in which significant difference learning motivation of the students in regular class was higher than that of students in training class, (3) the quality of students' learning skills training classes as very bad and regular classroom students classified as not good at SMA N 5 Padang, (4) {{there was a significant difference}} between learning skill quality of the students in regular class and in training class in which learning skill quality of the regular class was higher than that of the students in training class, and (5) students <b>self</b> <b>regulated</b> learning training class and regular class in high at SMA N 5 Padang is category good, (6) there were no significant differences in which <b>self</b> <b>regulated</b> learning training class students together with students regular class, (7) there are significant differences between the motivation to learn, the quality of learning skills, and <b>self</b> <b>regulated</b> learning training class students and students' regular classroom...|$|R
40|$|In view of {{the very}} complex {{equipment}} making up the LHC machine and its many ancillary subsystems, equipment maintenance policies will play a primordial role to ensure an optimal availability. As access {{to most of the}} machine <b>systems</b> is strictly <b>regulated,</b> <b>maintenance</b> interventions will require global co-ordination and collaboration from both CERN equipment groups and industrial support teams. The talk will briefly touch on the different main systems and technical infrastructure involved and what is presently known about their operations and maintenance policy. Further extensions to the LHC QAP on the operations and maintenance phase will be mentioned. Issues like mean-time to repair, spares and contractual piquet service will become of major importance already in the installation phase. A rapid introduction and some examples from CERN’s asset tracking and <b>maintenance</b> <b>system</b> (MP 5) will show what support can be expected from an industrial approach to maintenance issues...|$|R

40|$|The {{main focus}} of this {{dissertation}} is on self-regulated learning processes while using e-Learning applications considering as example apprentices. The thesis consists of five parts: introduction into {{the use of interactive}} media in vocational training, principles of self-regulated learning and of multimedia didactics and psychology, survey (expertise) and evaluation of a specific multimedia learn software for self-regulated learning for apprentices in the trade of electricians and concluding modification concepts for the evaluated learn software in regard to integration of effective functions to support self-regulated learning with this program. One of the main focuses in the theoretical part (part I) is the reflection on learn psychological conditions for effective self-regulated learning. On the one hand, the necessary competences and learn strategies for the learner were analyzed. On the other hand, didactical methods for encouragement and training of self-regulated learning were discussed. Furthermore, the fundamental instructional, psychological and multimedia presentation techniques and methods for e-learning applications were developed. A particular emphasis was put on pedagogical agents which are able to support learners during their self-regulated learning processes. In {{the second part of the}} thesis a survey of the learn software Elektrische Schutzmassnahmen(electrical precaution) was done on the basis of the instructional, psychological and multimedia presentation criteria worked out in part 1. The survey was carried out by the author of the dissertation. The learn software was designed for self-regulated learning for apprentices in the trade of electricians. The results of the survey are presented in a chart showing the positive and negative effects. In addition to that, an extensive examination and discussion of the media presentation techniques, their functions and didactic is given. The third step is an evaluation of the learn program Elektrische Schutzmassnahmen(electrical precaution). About 190 apprentices and 16 instructors in 20 training posts were interviewed. On the one hand was the insight, that the multimedia program has made the learn process about the very abstract rules and norms of the electrician preventive measure much more attractive and interesting. on the other hand has been detected that the learn software show lot of lacks for effective <b>self</b> <b>regulated</b> learning. In the fourth part have been worked out concrete concepts for the modification of the learn software Elektrische Schutzmassnahmen (electrical precaution). The concepts are based on the theoretical insights about the <b>self</b> <b>regulated</b> learning, about multimedia didactics as soon as on the outcomes and conclusions of the expertise and of the evaluation. The improvement is based on modified and additional functions for support the <b>self</b> <b>regulated</b> learning process with the program. An important part of the modification was the transformation of the existing guide character to the pedagogical agent with coach and team mate functionality. For the implementation have been prepared concrete technical solutions and screenplays. The main conclusions of the work: an effective <b>self</b> <b>regulated</b> learning had to be train and to be use consciously; in the vocational training for the apprentice there is scarcely introduction to the topic and the competences of <b>self</b> <b>regulated</b> learning; pedagogical agents could well support learner by more effective <b>self</b> <b>regulated</b> learning processes; e-learning applications should contain supporting functions for <b>self</b> <b>regulated</b> learning...|$|R
