5|$|After it {{fell into}} disuse during the Bronze Age, Maeshowe was re-opened and used centuries later by Vikings from about the 9th to the 12th centuries AD. The Norsemen left {{a series of}} runic {{inscriptions}} on the <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> of the chamber, {{some of which were}} left by a group of crusaders in the winter of 115354. Over thirty individual inscriptions remain, one of the largest such collections in Europe.|$|E

5|$|Andrianampoinimerina {{removed the}} twin houses {{to build his}} much larger Mahandrihono residence, which was {{decorated}} with silver birds and chains. He also expanded the compound and added a second enclosure of voafotsy wood (replaced annually) around {{the exterior of the}} <b>stone</b> <b>walls.</b> Mandraimanjaka was removed and in its place Andrianampoinimerina built a house with a small tower, which he named Manjakamiadana ("where it is good to rule"), designating it as the residence for the royal sampy (idol) called Imanjakatsiroa and the guardians assigned to protect it. Two other idols were kept nearby: Ifantaka, kept in a house in the Bevato compound, and Kelimalaza, guarded in its house at the Ambohimanga neighborhood of Ambohimirary. Under Radama I, the stone wall was reinforced with palisades that enclosed three houses, two of which were twin houses like those that Andriambelomasina had built. Ranavalona I enlarged the compound's courtyard and expanded Manjakamiadana. She constructed the <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> that currently enclose the compound, as well as its two stone gateways. Ranavalona II re-added palisades to the compound's <b>stone</b> <b>walls.</b> She demolished Manjakamiadana and in its place constructed two hybrid Malagasy-European pavilions using wood from the historic and spiritually significant Masoandro house, which had been removed from the royal compound of Antananarivo by Ranavalona I. French general Joseph Gallieni used these European-influenced buildings as his summer residence {{in the early years of}} the French colonial period. In 2013, Andrianampoinimerina's original house, the reconstructed tombs, and the two royal pavilions are preserved in the compound, which also includes a watchtower, a pen for sacrificial zebu, and two pools constructed during the reign of Ranavalona I.|$|E
5|$|In June 2012 the museum's {{entrance}} was redesigned by Clash Architects with consulting engineers Price & Myers. Intended {{to act as}} a 'beacon' for the museum, the new {{external design}} included a faceted bronze entranceway, while the interior showed the cleaned and restored Portland <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> of the Treasury building and Clive Steps. The design was described as 'appropriately martial and bulldog-like' and as 'a fusion of architecture and sculpture'.|$|E
5|$|In {{a further}} royal charter of 28 April 1472, King James III ordered the {{demolition}} of houses built on or outside the King's Wall, which were hampering efforts to strengthen the defences. Edinburgh was thus {{one of only three}} Scottish towns to have medieval <b>stone</b> <b>walls,</b> the others being Stirling and Perth, though other towns had earth walls or palisades.|$|E

He looked up at old Mother Moon and bayed and bayed, but old Mother Moon did not help him a bit. Then he jumped over the <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> and looked, and looked, and smelled, and smelled, but no track of Mother Fox could he find. Then he ran up along the <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> a little way, and then down along the <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> a little way, but still he could not find a track of Mother Fox. The longer he hunted, the angrier he grew.|$|R
5000|$|Milecastle 50TW was a milecastle {{constructed}} {{as part of}} the turf wall section of Hadrian's Wall, and is situated to the west of Birdoswald fort. [...] It is unique in being the only original turf wall milecastle where the <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> milecastle built to replace it was not constructed on the same site; {{this is due to the}} divergent nature of the original turf <b>wall,</b> and replacement <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> at this reach. The replacement <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> milecastle, milecastle 50 was built some 200 m to the north.|$|R
5|$|Munro also {{reported}} that, at the time, Rùm was highly forested, with {{an abundance of}} deer. Munro goes on to argue that the best way of slaying the deer would be when they are moving uphill (when gravity is against them), their principle home being in the heights. Contemporary with Munro, substantial <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> were built in the glens to funnel deer into pens.|$|E
5|$|P. imperialis {{crossed the}} waters between Australia and New Zealand some time between 1960 and 1972, and {{seedlings}} {{of the previously}} infertile trees of F. rubiginosa began appearing in brick and <b>stone</b> <b>walls,</b> and on other trees, particularly in parks and gardens around Auckland. They have been recorded {{as far south as}} Napier. P. imperialis has been transported to Hawaii, California and Israel, where it has been observed to pollinate its host.|$|E
5|$|The Walls of Constantinople are {{a series}} of {{defensive}} <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> that have surrounded and protected the city of Constantinople (today Istanbul in Turkey) since its founding as the new capital of the Roman Empire by Constantine the Great.

5|$|The hills {{are largely}} formed from Carboniferous Limestone, which is quarried at several sites. Three nationally {{important}} semi-natural habitats {{are characteristic of}} the area: ash–maple woodland, calcareous grassland and mesotrophic grassland. With their temperate climate these support a range of flora and fauna including birds, butterflies and small mammals. The dry <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> that divide the pasture into fields are of botanical importance as they support important populations of the nationally scarce wall whitlowgrass (Draba muralis).|$|E
5|$|The mosque's {{adjoining}} large, round blue-and-white minaret (built in 1675) {{resembles a}} wedding cake, {{with a wide}} base similar to a ship's funnel. Built of coral stones, it is braced with metal strips. The minaret {{is surrounded by a}} graveyard with carved coral tombstones distinguishing males, females, sultans and their families. Women's tombstones have rounded tops; men's have pointed tops, and inscriptions for royalty are gilt. For family members, small mausoleums with intricately-decorated <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> were built.|$|E
5|$|A new keep was built, {{probably}} in the 13th century. This {{took the form of}} a polygonal shell keep, with fourteen triangular buttresses supporting six foot (1.8 m) thick walls. The inner bailey was strengthened with new <b>stone</b> <b>walls,</b> 20 to 30 feet (6 to 9 m) tall on top of the earlier earth banks, the walls and keep being built of flint and rubble. The castle was manned during this period by a castle-guard system, in which lands were given out to local lords in return for their providing knights and soldiers to serve at the castle.|$|E

50|$|During {{the reign}} of Emperor Justinian I (527-565), a large <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> was erected from the Saronic to the Corinthian gulfs, {{protecting}} {{the city and the}} Peloponnese peninsula from the barbarian invasions from the north. The <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> was about six miles (10 km) long and was named Hexamilion ("six-miles").|$|R

5|$|A {{subsequent}} rebuilding saw {{the timber}} palisades {{of the inner}} bailey replaced by <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> and towers. Exactly when this happened is unclear, but {{it may have been}} under Peter of Savoy, the Earl of Richmond, who was granted the castle by Henry III in 1246. There is no record of the rebuilding but in 1254 Peter ended the feudal requirement to maintain the palisades and replaced it with cash payments. This probably reflected the replacement of the palisades with the <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> and towers visible today. The castle faced a lengthy siege only a decade later during the Second Barons' War from the rebel baron Simon de Montfort, following Henry's defeat in the Battle of Lewes. Defeated members of the royalist army fled to Pevensey, pursued by de Montford's forces, but the garrison refused an invitation to surrender and endured over a year of besiegement. Their adversaries were unable to stop supplies reaching the castle despite digging a ditch to cut it off from the mainland; its garrison raided the surrounding countryside and sought to obtain fresh supplies of men and weapons by sea in December 1264. The costly and ineffective siege was eventually lifted in July 1265. It caused significant damage to the castle, with the Roman wall toppled on the south side. The parish churches at Pevensey and Westham also suffered damage, which the attackers may have caused in using them as siege castles (temporary fortresses and artillery platforms).|$|E
5|$|Although no {{property}} in the village is older than the early 17th century, its layout reflects its development in medieval times as a planned village. Eight toft compartments are discernible {{to the west of}} Main Street, and the outline of the four surrounding common fields, now divided, may be identified from the pattern of dry <b>stone</b> <b>walls.</b> The fields were largely arable, providing the village with most of its food requirements, but are now farmed exclusively for pasture and hay. The village manor house was on land now occupied by Hebden Hall {{at the south end of}} Main Street.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} from various {{sites on the}} Iberian peninsula suggest the domestication {{of plants and animals}} between 6,000 and 4,500 BC. Céide Fields in Ireland, consisting of extensive tracts of land enclosed by <b>stone</b> <b>walls,</b> date to 3,500 BC and are the oldest known field systems in the world. The horse was domesticated in the Pontic steppe around 4,000 BC. In Siberia, Cannabis was in use in China in Neolithic times and may have been domesticated there; it was in use both as a fibre for ropemaking and as a medicine in Ancient Egypt by about 2,350 BC.|$|E

5|$|Cow Tower is an {{artillery}} tower {{that was built}} in the city of Norwich, Norfolk, England, between 1398 and 1399. Norwich was a prosperous city in the late 14th century, with a population of around 5,000 involved in key medieval industries and forming a centre for international trade. Between 1297 and 1350 the city had erected a circuit of defensive <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> and ditches, both to impress upon outsiders the status of Norwich as a great city, but also to defend against invasion or civil disorder.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{deterioration}} of the wood of the exterior balconies over time, Queen RanavalonaII commissioned James Cameron to reinforce and encase the original structure in a stone shell in 1867. Cameron's exterior replaced the wooden balconies with <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> three stories high. On each of the three floors, seven arched windows run the length of the two longer side walls while five windows illuminate the shorter front and back walls. A square tower stands at each of the four corners of the stone shell, extending above the level of the walls and forming their junction. A clock and bells were installed in the north-eastern tower.|$|E
5|$|During the English Civil War in the 1640s the old medieval {{walls were}} {{reinforced}} with modern earthwork bastions and an outlying fort, called a sconce. Worcester changed hands {{several times during}} the conflict, and after the war ended the newer fortifications were dismantled. During the 18th century the older medieval <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> and gatehouses were sold and mostly destroyed: by the 20th century, few parts survived. Post-war archaeology in the 1950s and 1960s and construction work in the 1970s revealed previously hidden stretches of the wall, and in the 21st century plans have been drawn up to improve the conservation and maintenance of this historic monument.|$|E
