25|$|Maria demanded as Quisling's wife to get {{half the}} value of the bo. The {{directorate}} did not accept this, but accepted that she should get back everything she had brought into it. She obtained many letters of support, including from Odd Nansen, a son of Fridtjof Nansen who had been imprisoned by the authorities during the occupation. In 1950, the Compensation directorate undid the sale of the apartment in Erling Skjalgssons street and <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>it</b> back. She continued to provide letters that were meant to document which things she had brought into the bo.|$|E
500|$|At the time, de Boer {{was busy}} working in Canada but was unknown {{as an actress}} in the United States. She was called to Los Angeles to {{audition}} in person based {{on the strength of}} the tape, where she performed a four and a half minute scene written specifically for the audition. It was later converted into a scene used in the episode [...] "". She thought she had ruined her audition when she nearly choked on a glass of water as executive producer Rick Berman entered the room and had to run to the bathroom, by which time she had already soaked her clothes and caused her mascara to run. But Behr praised her, saying [...] "We got a good vibe off her, she knew her part. <b>She</b> <b>got</b> <b>it.</b> And that was it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Right Round" [...] {{was written}} by Flo Rida, Dr. Luke, Kool Kojak, DJ Frank E, Philip Lawrence, Bruno Mars, Aaron Bay-Schuck, and Dead or Alive, the band whose 1984 song, [...] "You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)" [...] is sampled in the chorus. The track was {{produced}} by Dr. Luke and Kool Kojak and features guest vocals from American pop singer Kesha, (who was not credited on the American release of the single). At the end of 2008, Luke {{was working on a}} track with Flo Rida called [...] "Right Round" [...] and the two decided they needed a female hook. Luke pulled Kesha into the studio to record the vocals. According to Flo Rida, the song is about [...] "a young lady, she might be in the strip club and she's got my head spinning round, [...] Or any young lady that I might see walking past me that's getting my attention. <b>She</b> <b>got</b> <b>it</b> going on! I'm going crazy over her." ...|$|E

2500|$|The next {{fantasy world}} she created was the tetralogy {{set in the}} {{universe}} of The Sharing Knife, borrowing inspiration for its landscapes and for the dialect of the [...] "farmers" [...] from ones she grew up with in central Ohio.

2500|$|A mid-tempo heartbreak song, {{the lyrics}} of [...] "The Root" [...] have the narrator lamenting a lost lover; [...] "In the name of love and hope she took my shield and sword ... From the pit of the bottom that knows no floor/Like the rain to the dirt, from the vine to the wine/From the alpha of creation, {{to the end of}} all time". The final two minutes of [...] "The Root" [...] feature an {{emphatic}} refrain of the chorus line. Reveille Magazine's Steve McPherson wrote that the chorus [...] "feeds back into itself over and over again, turning from a hook into a mantra into a gospel affirmation". In the promotional EPK for Voodoo, D'Angelo discussed the therapeutic nature of recording [...] "The Root", stating [...] "It was kinda therapeutic for me to do this song. It kinda help me get over, because I'm so pathetic in the song. You know what I mean? That's what 'The Root' is. <b>She</b> <b>got</b> <b>it</b> on me. And I'm just fucked up. It was good for me to get over that. It was hard for me sometimes to do that song. To record it, because when doing it I would have to put myself in that mode you know".|$|E
2500|$|After Alfie {{returns from}} Germany, Jean {{tells him to}} buy scented candles as Kat used one while he was away. He asks Kat where <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>it</b> from and she lies that {{it was from the}} local shop but he discovers they do not sell them. He then finds out Kat closed the pub early one night because it was [...] "quiet" [...] but worries it may have been for another reason. He then finds the ring that Kat pawned and asks Jean if she or Charlie lent Kat money, but they did not, and the {{pawnbroker}} refuses to tell him who bought it. The next day, he is suspicious when Kat leaves the pub and tells Michael that she is untrustworthy. Michael says Kat would not cheat again, revealing he knew about the affair, but he does not know who Kat was seeing. Alfie is in turmoil when Michael advises him not to pursue his suspicions. Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) finds a key on the bar and leaves it in a glass, but Alfie later notices it has gone. As he hides a Christmas present in Kat's jewellery box, he finds the key hidden there with the ring. He then leaves, claiming he will be away overnight, and asks Jean and Roxy to look after the bar so Kat can have the night off. Roxy tells the three Branning brothers that Alfie is away, and shortly after, Kat receives a phone call. She heads out, unaware that Alfie is watching. Alfie watches Kat enter the bedsit and kicks the door open, where he sees lit candles and rose petals. He looks for Kat's lover but she is alone. He demands to know who she is seeing, reminding her that she claimed her lover lived miles away. Kat insists this was her only lie and says the affair is over but her lover kept pestering her and threatening to tell Alfie. Alfie brings out Kat's mother's ring and asks how her lover knew about it if she had not seen him. Kat reveals she had not seen him alone, so Alfie realises it is someone he knows. Alfie decides to stay until he arrives, but then sees a rental agreement. Kat quickly sets fire to it, but Alfie sees the name Mr Branning. She tells Alfie she refused to let the man in while he was in Germany, and refuses to reveal which brother it is. Alfie says she makes him sick and goes to The Queen Victoria to find out the truth. While Kat searches for her phone in the bedsit, all three Branning brothers deny everything to Alfie. Kat then phones one of them and Alfie answers. Kat panics and runs to the pub. Alfie then returns the phone to its owner, Max, and attacks him. Kat stops Alfie, saying he has the wrong person. Alfie asks who it is, and Kat points at a smug Derek.|$|E

60|$|Yes she had though. How <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>it</b> out, in her muffled state, Heaven knows; but <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>it</b> out somehow--there it was--and {{slipped it}} through the Secretary's.|$|E
