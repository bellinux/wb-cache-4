In the case of deep groove <b>ball</b> <b>bearings,</b> assembly is usually undertaken through slight deformation of the outer ring to increase clearance for insertion of the final ball. As a result, the outer ring takes an elliptical instead of a circular shape and requires deformation to be below a critical level to avoid fracture. Causal analysis of outer ring fracture during assembly is the main goal of the presented analysis, based on the expressions of the Theory of Elasticity for the thin ring exposed to bending, as well as Finite Element Analysis (FEA). The theoretical and numerical results have been verified by experimental testing...|$|R

40|$|For {{the purpose}} of the {{numerical}} analysis of the actual carrying capacity of rolling contacts in large rolling bearings with surface-hardened raceways, an elasto-plastic constitutive model was used which links the mechanics of material damage with the isotropic and kinematic hardening or softening. A damage material model, implemented into a commercial finite element program, allows us to monitor the elastic strain, plastic strain increase, stress changes and material damage growth, which are closely related to the number ofload cycles. In this way, the location and the time of occurrence of bearing raceway damage can be determined along with the growth of damage up to the point when a microcrack is formed. In other words, low cycle life of rotational rolling connection can be assessed.

40|$|Rolling-element {{bearings}} {{are simple}} machine elements of great utility used both in simple commercial devices as in complex engineering mechanisms. Because {{of being a}} very popular machine element, {{there is a lot}} of literature on the subject. With regard to the behavior of internal loading distribution, elastic deformations at point or line contacts, and geometric parameters under loading, although there are many works describing the parameters variation models, few works show such variations in practice, even under simple static loadings. In an attempt to cover this gap some studies are being developed in parallel.

5000|$|... 1899: Employed as {{operating}} {{engineer at}} Gamlestadens Textile Industry in Göteborg {{where he worked}} many years {{to find a solution}} to the problems with frequent break downs in the <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> for the main drive shafts. This was caused by the ground conditions with lots of clay that the factory was built on and the shaft bearing supports moved some fractions of millimeters from time to time, hardly measurable, inducing enormous extra forces in the [...] "stiff" [...] bearings that was available at that time. Wingqvist spent more and more time on the development of bearings in general, collecting all sorts of technical achievements and new ideas that was presented continuously on the <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> concepts around Europe. In particular he carefully studied the report presented in 1902 by professor Richard Stribeck working at the Institute of Technology in Dresden, Germany, where he had compared <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> versus plain bearings from a scientific point of view. Wingqvist soon realized that the <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> techniques had a future and that there was room for innovations. On his initiative a small workshop was set up within the premises of Gamlestadens factory where they could carry out tests with different designs and steel materials. In 1906 he was granted a patent for a <b>Single-row</b> self-aligning <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> (Swedish patent reg. No. 24160) but this type of bearing had the disadvantage that it could not stand very much axial loads. His work continued in order to find the solution for a self-aligning bearing that also could carry some axial loads.|$|R
40|$|Aero-engines {{have high}} speed rotors {{carrying}} multi-stage turbine and compressor discs. Such systems need continuous monitoring during the operating regime. These rotors are mounted on <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> supported with squeeze film dampers {{and connected to}} stator casings. The motions of bearings and rotor are influenced by each other and therefore such a system requires structural dynamic studies. These rotors involve several nonlinear factors including contact forces, varying compliance vibration of <b>ball</b> <b>bearing,</b> nonlinear oil-film force of squeeze film damper etc Solving such nonlinear dynamic problems using the traditional transfer matrix method, modal synthesis approach, finite element method or impedance coupling technique is therefore a challenging task. Present work focuses on modelling of rotors using <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> nonlinearities along with nonlinear secondary transient excitations using finite element modelling. In order to validate the finite element model, preliminary dynamic analysis is carried out using linear spring-damper bearing elements. Results are illustrated both for LP rotor model and twin-spool rotor. Initially, the natural frequencies obtained from the computer program based on Timoshenko beam elements are validated with ANSYS results. Further, the results are also validated with those obtained from impact hammer tests on a scaled dual disk rotor-bearing system. To utilize this finite element model, the time and frequency-domain response studies are conducted with double-row <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> forces, rub-impact forces, Muszynska’s gas transients along with squeeze-film forces. In all the cases, differences from simple rotor supported by <b>single-row</b> <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> with only unbalance excitations have been reported. Using the fundamental frequency and its amplitude, an inverse modelling approach is applied to predict the parameters of rotor bearing system such as increased bearing clearance, changes in disc unbalances and the centralizing spring constants in squeeze-film damper. In this regard, a trained model of 3 -layer perceptron neural network model is employed. In the second study, changes in dynamic response due to waviness and race-way defects in ball-bearings are first studied using modified contact force relations. Using this data, type of bearing fault is estimated from the statistical parameters of the time-domain signal by training an unsupervised Kohenen’s neural network model. Here, the simulated data is collected from the rotor over an operating speed range. In the third study, the additional stiffness of rotor due to rub-impact forces is identified from optimization modelling. Such identification of rotor stiffening effect using finite element modelling is a new concept. Two types of control studies are proposed to minimize the amplitudes of rotor during the critical operating conditions. Semi active electromagnetic damper design helps in reducing vibration amplitudes of the LP rotor over a frequency range of interest. Here, the damper comprises of an electro-magnet and a spring. The required current and spring stiffness are identified from the basic relations {{and the results of}} control are illustrated with a two-disc LP rotor model. In active controller design, an electromagnetic actuator model is employed. The nominal gap maintained between the rotor and actuator coils is used in computing the actuator force. A proportional derivative (PD) control strategy is used to estimate the required forces. A neural network based alternate control scheme also proposed to compute the required actuator forces. In overall, the work focussed on the dynamic analysis of dual disc rotor model subjected to parametric nonlinear bearing loads under the action of various external forces and some controller design aspects applicable to this rotor. ...|$|R
