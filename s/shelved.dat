50|$|Mobile <b>shelving,</b> mobile aisle <b>shelving,</b> roller racking, or rolling stack, are terms {{applied to}} <b>shelving</b> or storage units fitted with wheeled {{traction}} systems. Units can be closely packed when access is not required, {{but can be}} readily moved to open up an aisle to allow access. By {{eliminating the need for}} a permanently open aisle between every unit, a smaller proportion of floor space can be allocated to storage than in the case of conventional fixed <b>shelving,</b> or a higher capacity of storage can be met using the same footprint as fixed <b>shelving.</b>|$|R
50|$|However, {{with the}} use of a <b>shelving</b> buffer, the {{instruction}} window will be emptied into <b>shelving</b> buffers regardless of contents.

5|$|A {{project to}} improve the {{performance}} of the J 34 resulted in one Hunter being fitted with a Swedish-designed afterburner in 1958. While this significantly increased the engine's thrust, there was little improvement in overall performance, thus the project was <b>shelved.</b> The last of the J 34s was retired from service in 1969.|$|E
5|$|According to Kotaku, a remastered {{version of}} Day of the Tentacle {{was in the}} works at LucasArts Singapore before the sale of LucasArts to Disney in 2012. Though never officially approved, the game used a pseudo-3D art style and was nearly 80% complete, {{according}} to one person close to the project, but was <b>shelved</b> {{in the days before}} the closure of LucasArts.|$|E
40|$|Parametrically tunable audio {{equalizers}} are conventionally realized using allpass digital lter networks. They {{consist of}} rst-order <b>shelving</b> lters and second-order equalizing lters. In this paper, ladder wave digital lters (WDFs) with parametrically tunable coecients are proposed as <b>shelving</b> and equalizing lters. Similar to the allpass realization, {{the transfer function}} power complementary property of WDFs is used to obtain ecient <b>shelving</b> and equalizing lters. However, unlike the allpass structures, the transfer function and the tunable parameters of the ladder WDF are derived from the analog lter equivalent of the digital <b>shelving</b> and equalizing lters. For the <b>shelving</b> WDF, the cut-o frequency and gain are tunable, while for the equalizing WDF, the tunable parameters are the center frequency, 3 -dB bandwidth and gain. The transfer functions are derived and shown {{in terms of the}} tunable coecients for both the <b>shelving</b> and equalizing WDFs. Key Words: Tunable parameters, audio <b>shelving</b> lters, equalizing lters, wave digital lters. 1...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Shelving</b> Engineering is {{the science}} of {{studying}} static loadings that happen in retail stores and in stocks.

50|$|The primary {{aspect of}} the {{management}} of physical evidence is the provision of suitable storage facility. Storage facilities for evidence can vary in size from a single secure cabinet in an office to large dedicated warehouses.The physical storage of evidence in modern departments is often accomplished using hi-density <b>shelving</b> systems. These systems allow use of only one aisle to access several rows of <b>shelving</b> by means of rolling carriages that have <b>shelving</b> mounted to them.This results in storing double the amount of evidence in the same space {{that would be used}} on static <b>shelving.</b> These hi-density system can accommodate <b>shelving,</b> <b>shelving</b> with lockable drawers, bulk rack, pallet rack, and lockable cabinets. In addition hi-density style systems can lock off specific aisles for the various degrees of security often needed for items such as guns and drugs.|$|R
5|$|After {{a week of}} shooting, {{the film}} was <b>shelved</b> due {{to the view that}} such a story might not succeed in Telugu; the {{production}} company instead produced Shanti, which became a failure. D.L. Narayana then decided to revive Devadasu as an independent producer. Janaki, who was originally chosen for the character of Parvati, was replaced by Savitri.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{original}} plan was <b>shelved,</b> {{the need for a}} highway in western Nassau County still existed. In 1963, the Department of Public Works revived the project; however, the routing was altered to extend from the Sunrise Highway (NY27) north to an intersection with CR101 (Middle Neck Road) in Sands Point. Part of the route would use modern NY101 and the right-of-way of an abandoned Long Island Rail Road line. In 1971, several proposed crossings of the Long Island Sound were studied. One crossing, a bridge connecting Sands Point to New Rochelle to Westchester County, may have become a northward extension of the highway if it was constructed. By 1971, though, hopes had begun to fade on the highway's prospects of becoming reality. Even if construction had begun in that year, the highway would not be open to traffic until 1975. The project was eventually <b>shelved.</b>|$|E

5|$|Early {{development}} {{for a third}} film began in 2002, with a working title of Fantasia 2006.

5|$|Eventually, Richard Maibaum {{provided}} the screenplay, {{and at first}} he tried to incorporate ideas {{from all of the}} other writers into his script.

However, this was <b>shelved.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2011, it was {{announced}} that MacFarlane would be reviving The Flintstones for the Fox network, with the first episode airing in 2013. MacFarlane said that he would provide the voice of Barney Rubble. However, at the San Diego Comic-Con in July 2012, while promoting Ted, MacFarlane revealed that the project had been <b>shelved</b> due to the unimpressed response garnered by Fox.|$|E
50|$|Note {{that a high}} <b>shelving</b> {{control in}} which fz is set to {{infinity}} or a low <b>shelve</b> response in which fz is set to zero implements a first order low-pass or high-pass filter respectively. However usual tone controls have a more limited range, since the purpose isn't to eliminate any frequencies but only to achieve a greater balance when, for instance, the treble is lacking and the sound is not crisp. Since the range of possible responses from <b>shelving</b> filters is so limited, some audio engineers considered <b>shelving</b> controls inadequate for equalization tasks.|$|R

50|$|Seeking a more {{flexible}} and reusable alternative to wooden <b>shelving</b> to store paper and other consumables in his London-based printing business, engineer Demetrius Comino invented the slotted angle steel construction system, Dexion, and began production in 1947. This quickly became popular internationally for domestic and commercial <b>shelving,</b> warehouse pallet racking and other purposes. Dexion and other <b>shelving</b> and racking brands are still marketed by the Norwegian Constructor Group.|$|R
