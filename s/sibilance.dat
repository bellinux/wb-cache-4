The compressor behaves in the conventional manner when both inputs are supplied with the same signal. The side-chain input is used by disc jockeys for ducking – lowering the music volume automatically when speaking. The DJ's microphone signal is routed to the side-chain input so that whenever the DJ speaks the compressor reduces the volume of the music. A sidechain with equalization controls can be used to reduce the volume of signals that have a strong spectral content within a certain frequency range: it can act as a de-esser, reducing the level of vocal <b>sibilance</b> in the range of 6–9kHz. A de-esser helps reduce high frequencies that tend to overdrive preemphasized media (such as phonograph records and FM radio). Another use of the side-chain in music production serves to maintain a loud bass track without the bass drum causing undue peaks that result in loss of overall headroom.|$|E

40|$|This {{creative}} work is an original soundtrack for the multimedia performance adaptation of Oscar Wilde’s De Profundis, led by David Fenton and Brian Lucas and produced by Metro Arts. Intermediality offers unique {{challenges to the}} composer creating towards live performance. Given the text-based nature of the piece, and the prevalence of screen content, music had a distinct {{role to play in}} supporting the intermedial performance environment. Drawing from Oscar Wilde’s own writings in the initial stages [“ [...] . richer cadences…more curious effects” “…the cry of Marysas” and the “deferred resolution of Chopin”], the deliberately risky compositional process experimented with improvised location recordings and found sounds, random and fragmented assemblages of vintage recordings, rough methods and obsolete recording technology, and the sonic kinship of the hissing <b>sibilances</b> of the sea, theatrical applause and the crackle of antique recording devices (which had just been invented in Wilde’s time) worked into wefts of sound. As the soundtrack emerged, is was clearly resistant to ‘concepts’ imposed from the outside, and as the field of possibilities expanded and engaged in dialogue with the other elements of the performance (live and projected) certain pieces were selected by the director and curated into the emerging work. Thus leitmotifs emerged, rather than being imposed from the outset, with a particular through line holding: if it was too obviously like ‘music’, (which is usually used in theatre as emotional lubrication and narrative signpost) it didn’t work, and if it sounded like avant-garde sound-art, it was too grating and detracted from the primacy of the text. As a composer I worked this sweet spot inbetween these two poles as well as serving David Fenton’s curation: he determined which compositions to incorporate, reiterate and omit as {{part of the process of}} writing text, action and image and the compositional process responded with organic elaborations and variations on these selections. Musical resolution was mostly deferred until the closing stages of the performance. The soundtrack was present for the duration of the show, and Artshub reviewed the musical component thus: “ [...] . the score by David Megarrity is a refined, understated ambient scaffolding. ” It premiered at the Visy Theatre, Brisbane Powerhouse, on 22 April 2015...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Sibilance</b> is {{used most}} {{successfully}} in stanzas one and five. Emily uses <b>sibilance</b> {{to imitate the}} sound and atmosphere {{she is trying to}} describe.

5000|$|Whereas, [...] "Sister Suzy sewing socks for soldiers" [...] is a {{particular}} form of alliteration called <b>sibilance,</b> because it repeats the letter s.|$|E
50|$|The gain of a {{parametric}} equalizer {{is reduced}} as {{the level of}} the <b>sibilance</b> increases. The frequency range of the equalizer is centered on the sibilant frequencies.|$|E
50|$|The 4038's {{frequency}} response is flat, {{with a range}} of approximately 30 - 15,000 Hz. The attenuation of high frequencies reduces <b>sibilance</b> on vocals, but also reduces detail.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} signal {{can either}} be split into high (sibilant) and low frequencies, or split so that the frequencies both below and above the <b>sibilance</b> are untouched. This technique is similar to multi-band compression.|$|E
50|$|A {{more recent}} method of de-essing {{involves}} automation of the vocal {{level in a}} digital audio workstation (DAW). Whenever problematic <b>sibilance</b> occurs the level can be set to follow automation curves that are manually drawn in by the user.|$|E
50|$|Excess <b>sibilance</b> can {{be caused}} by compression, {{microphone}} choice and technique, and even simply the way a person's mouth anatomy is shaped. Ess sound frequencies can be irritating to the ear, especially with earbuds or headphones, and interfere with an otherwise modulated and pleasant audio stream.|$|E
5000|$|De-essing (also desibilizing) is any {{technique}} {{intended to}} reduce or eliminate the excessive prominence of sibilant consonants, such as [...] "s", [...] "z", [...] "c" [...] and [...] "sh", in recordings of the human voice. <b>Sibilance</b> lies in frequencies anywhere between 2-10 kHz, depending on the individual voice.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sibilance</b> is {{a manner}} of {{articulation}} of fricative and affricate consonants, made by directing a stream of air with the tongue towards the sharp edge of the teeth, which are held close together; a consonant that uses <b>sibilance</b> may be called a sibilant, or a strident. Examples of sibilants are the consonants {{at the beginning of}} the English words sip, zip, ship, chip, and jump, and the second consonant in vision. The symbols in the International Phonetic Alphabet used to denote the sibilant sounds in these words are, respectively, [...] More specifically, the sounds , as in chip and jump, are affricates, whereas the rest are fricatives. Sibilants have a characteristically intense sound, which accounts for their paralinguistic use in getting one's attention (e.g. calling someone using [...] "psst!" [...] or quieting someone using [...] "shhhh!").|$|E

5000|$|The {{second step}} was the devoicing of voiced sibilants. [...] In the north, [...] and [...] were lost, though [...] {{remained}} contrastive as {{there had been}} no voiceless [...] This sound contrasted with two acoustically similar sounds: dentoalveolar [...] and apicoalveolar [...] By 1600, [...] had deaffricated and merged with [...] [...] Subsequent changes to the sound system of Spanish retained the contrasts while enhancing the segments by increasing articulatory distance amongst their rather subtle acoustic contrasts, an appropriate step due to the high productivity of these phonemes in differentiating frequently used minimal pairs. The dentoalveolar one was moved [...] "forward" [...] to interdental , losing its former <b>sibilance</b> in the process (which increased its acoustic distance to the remaining sibilant [...] ), and the prepalatal one was moved [...] "backward" [...] to velar [...] also losing its former <b>sibilance.</b> All in all resulting in the three-way distinction found in modern Standard Peninsular pronunciation: ...|$|E
5000|$|Another {{special case}} of consonance is <b>sibilance,</b> {{the use of}} several {{sibilant}} sounds such as /s/ and /sh/. An example is the verse from Edgar Allan Poe's [...] "The Raven": [...] "And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain." [...] (This example also contains assonance around the [...] "ur" [...] sound.) Another example of consonance is the word [...] "sibilance" [...] itself.|$|E

He has {{extensive}} knowledge of close support aircraft, ranging from jury-rigged civilian conversions, to state-of-the-art flying machines armed with laser-guided missiles and ECM pods. His speech pattern contains a characteristic <b>sibilance</b> caused by a mouth injury, which is rumored to have been inflicted by ground fire during a strafing run.|$|E
50|$|De-essing is {{a dynamic}} audio editing process, only working when {{the level of the}} signal in the {{sibilant}} range (the ess sound) exceeds a set threshold. De-essing temporarily reduces the level of high frequency content in the signal when a sibilant ess sound is present. De-essing differs from equalization, which is a static change in level among many frequencies. However, equalization of the ess frequencies alone can be manipulated to reduce the level of <b>sibilance.</b>|$|E
5000|$|During {{the first}} {{recording}} session in February 1972, the French television station ORTF filmed a short {{segment of the}} band recording the album, including interviews with bassist Roger Waters and guitarist David Gilmour.

50|$|With this technique, {{the signal}} feeding the {{side-chain}} of a dynamic range compressor is equalized or filtered {{so that the}} sibilant frequencies are most prominent. As a result, the compressor only reduces {{the level of the}} signal when there is a high level of <b>sibilance.</b> This reduces the level over the entire frequency range. Because of this, attack and release times are extremely important, and threshold settings cannot be placed as low as with other types of de-essing techniques without experiencing more blatant sound artifacts.|$|E
5000|$|Often {{there is}} an {{unvoiced}} band or <b>sibilance</b> channel. This is for frequencies that are outside the analysis bands for typical speech but are still important in speech. Examples are words that start with the letters s, f, ch or any other sibilant sound. These can be mixed with the carrier output to increase clarity. The result is recognizable speech, although somewhat [...] "mechanical" [...] sounding. Vocoders often include a second system for generating unvoiced sounds, using a noise generator instead of the fundamental frequency.|$|E
5000|$|Audio editing software, whether {{professional}} or amateur software such as Audacity, {{can use the}} built-in equalization effects to reduce or eliminate <b>sibilance</b> ess sounds that interfere with a recording. Described here is a common method with Audacity. The process is in two phases: 1) analyze {{the frequency of the}} voice's ess sound by sampling several instances and calculating the range of ess frequencies, which most likely fall between 4,000-10,000Hz depending on the speaker, then 2) apply an equalization effect to reduce the frequency by -4dB to -11db during ess frequency events.|$|E
50|$|In 1970, Jack Herschorn {{purchased}} the Universal Audio mixing console {{and a number}} of other pieces of equipment from that studio including UA LA-76A and LA-76B limiting amplifiers, UA vacuum tube power amplifiers (which were actually Dynakit Stereo 70 and 50-watt mono amplifier kits assembled into rack-mount chassis), Fairchild Conax <b>sibilance</b> controllers, Langevin graphic equalizers and Cinema Engineering filters, all originally installed in United Studio A in 1957. This equipment was shipped to Vancouver, Canada, and installed in Aragon Studios which he owned at the time, later renamed Mushroom Studios. Installation of the equipment in Vancouver was supervised by Charlie Richmond.|$|E
5000|$|Popping sounds occur {{particularly}} in the pronunciation of aspirated plosives (such as the first 'p' in the English word [...] "popping"). Pop filters are designed to attenuate {{the energy of the}} plosive, which otherwise might exceed the design input capacity of the microphone, leading to clipping. In effect, the plosive's discrete envelope of sound energy is intercepted and broken up by the strands of the filter material before it can impinge on, and momentarily distort, the sensitive diaphragm of the microphone. Pop filters do not appreciably affect hissing sounds or <b>sibilance,</b> for which de-essing is used.|$|E
5000|$|In 1970, Wendy Carlos and Robert Moog built another musical vocoder, a ten-band device {{inspired}} by the vocoder designs of Homer Dudley. It was originally called a spectrum encoder-decoder, and later referred to simply as a vocoder. The carrier signal came from a Moog modular synthesizer, and the modulator from a microphone input. The output of the ten-band vocoder was fairly intelligible, but relied on specially articulated speech. Later improved vocoders use a high-pass filter to let some <b>sibilance</b> through from the microphone; this ruins the device for its original speech-coding application, but it makes the [...] "talking synthesizer" [...] effect much more intelligible.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the first}} stanza {{the scene and}} {{atmosphere}} is set, [...] "we stood by a pond that winter day". No harsh sounds are present and the sentence epitomizes the tranquility yet disheartening nature of the poem. In the second line we get even more of these very [...] "neutral" [...] monosyllabic words [...] "the sun was white, as though chidden of God" [...] in this sentence the poet's attempt to stay within his own themes are very explicit {{by the use of}} the adjective [...] "white" [...] to describe the sun, the sun normally represented by the color yellow and a symbol for happiness and life. The very dismal atmosphere is reinforced by the use of the alliteration of [...] "L" [...] creating a lazy yet unsatisfying tone. The further <b>sibilance</b> of [...] "starving sod" [...] creates a harsh sound, adding a further layer of hopelessness. The metaphor of the [...] "few leaves" [...] symbolizes the end of an era, hinting towards the dying of life. Yet, it is not life that died, but love.|$|E
5000|$|The album {{features}} two lead vocalists, Molly Bancroft and Jan Burton, {{as well as}} backup vocals from Dave, Josh, Gabriel's wife, Kristy; {{and their}} little son, Rowan. The vocals also set in onslaught; this can make a background vocal chopped, reversed, reverbed, delayed, phased and distorted. The sound is made by Gabriel and Dresden with a Studio Projects tube microphone through a Grace 101 preamp into a Summit Audio TLA-50 compressor {{as well as in}} a MOTU 828mkII interface. Some vocal songs like [...] "Let Go" [...] featuring Molly Bancroft and [...] "Enemy" [...] with Burton prove how Gabriel and Dresden's methodology of creating an obvious lead vocal into separated, secondary layers. The background vocals provide a midpoint between high and low due to the sibilance; the highest part of the voice is the thing that gives one intelligibility, the high end is what makes the words clear since there is nothing clearer than one voice; everything else is blurrier once it is added. A song that meets these criteria is [...] "Tracking Treasure Down", which features one clear voice and the additional background vocals at a certain high end pulled down so high frequencies don't interfere with the lead voice. By taking away the high end it would become muddier, which is something Dave evaded; he took all high-end voices away, except for one, which peaks through and creates a definite position of all minor vocals. The layer comes from the pitch part of the voice and not the <b>sibilance,</b> which eliminates most high end and low end voices making it sound in layers. Leaving several vocals with all the high end in position overloads the sound for the ears. By taking all ends off it hurts the ears; in this situation they used a shelf, so it would pull 5 dB less from 5,600 Hz, making it sound like if the vocals lose edge, as if it were falling behind, which does not remove the bass. Dresden uses a high-pass filter at 1,100 Hz which lies in-between. Rocktronica singer and songwriter Jes Brieden helped with the writing of lyrics for songs like [...] "Enemy" [...] and [...] "Dangerous Power". Tracks [...] "Enemy" [...] and [...] "Dangerous Power" [...] are adaptations from the track [...] "Imagination" [...] by the duo's group Motorcycle with Jes Brieden. [...] "Dust in the Wind" [...] is a cover of the band Kansas; alternatively the duo wanted to cover [...] "Black Hole Sun" [...] by Soundgarden but they decided for [...] "Dust in the Wind" [...] since Dave felt it was a tribute to 9/11.|$|E
40|$|In {{contexts}} containing /ptk / between /s/’s, or in {{terminal position}} after a single /s/, spectrograms of real speech show transitions {{in the lower}} cut-off frequency of the <b>sibilance.</b> For the first /s/, they proceed upward for /t/, straight for /k/, and down-ward for /p/.

It is noted that in such cases transitions of adjacent vowel formants, which usually are {{the main source of}} place information (Delattre et al., 1962), are not available.
