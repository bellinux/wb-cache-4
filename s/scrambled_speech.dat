40|$|This paper shows a new {{approach}} of speech scrambling using imitation to produce a <b>scrambled</b> <b>speech</b> signal with intelligible content. The secret message imitates a target speech signal with non-confidential content through an adaptation mechanism. Unlike the classical approach, the key is not an input of the system because it is created in the adaptation process. Several tests are conducted in order to validate adaptation as an efficient key generator, and the robustness of the <b>scrambled</b> <b>speech</b> signal against signal manipulation attacks. The advantages of our proposal are (1) the <b>scrambled</b> <b>speech</b> signal is an intelligible speech signal {{so that it does}} not generate suspicious about the existence of the secret message, (2) the system does not require an external key generator because the elements are permutated according to the adaptation process, (3) the length of the key is long enough so that it guarantees that the key is not found by brute-force attack, and (4) it works with perfect secrecy because the a priori probability of the secret message {{is the same as the}} a posteriori probability, given the <b>scrambled</b> <b>speech</b> signal.

40|$|Effects of {{background}} speech on reading were examined by playing aloud different types {{of background}} speech, while participants read long, syntactically complex and less complex sentences embedded in text. Readers' eye movement patterns were used to study online sentence comprehension. Effects of background speech were primarily seen in rereading time. In Experiment 1, foreign-language background speech did not disrupt sentence processing. Experiment 2 demonstrated robust disruption in reading {{as a result of}} semantically and syntactically anomalous scrambled background speech preserving normal sentence-like intonation. <b>Scrambled</b> <b>speech</b> that was constructed from the text to-be read did not disrupt reading more than <b>scrambled</b> <b>speech</b> constructed from a different, semantically unrelated text. Experiment 3 showed that <b>scrambled</b> <b>speech</b> exacerbated the syntactic complexity effect more than coherent background speech, which also interfered with reading. Experiment 4 demonstrated that both semantically and syntactically anomalous speech produced no more disruption in reading than semantically anomalous but syntactically correct background speech. The pattern of results is best explained by a semantic account that stresses the importance of similarity in semantic processing, but not similarity in semantic content, between the reading task and background speech...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} analog speech encryption algorithms. It focuses specifically on schemes which are able to be used over narrowband communication channels, such as the Public Switched Telephone Network. The performance of the devices studied is evaluated according to three criteria. The <b>scrambled</b> <b>speech</b> derived from the encryption algorithm must have a low residual intelligibility. The encryption and decryption processes should have a minimal effect {{on the quality of}} the speech recovered by the intended recipient. Finally, the scrambler must be secure from cryptanalytic attack. Time domain, frequency domain and combined time and frequency domain scrambling procedures are considered initially. A review of their respective advantages and disadvantages is included which aims to facilitate the development of improved speech security systems. Original methods for the cryptanalysis of time element and frequency domain bandsplitting scramblers are presented. These attacks are applicable when the cryptanalyst has access to the <b>scrambled</b> <b>speech</b> only. In particular a novel cryptanalytic procedure is introduced which exploits the redundancy of speech using a frequency domain vector codebook. Attacks are also described which utilise plaintext with corresponding ciphertext to recover the encryption permutations used in the encryption process. It is shown that the two scramblers examined, are extremely vulnerable to the proposed cryptanalytic techniques...|$|E

40|$|The aim {{of speech}} {{scrambling}} algorithms is to transform clear speech into an unintelligible signal {{so that it}} is difficult to decrypt it in the absence of the key. Most of the existing speech scrambling algorithms tend to retain considerable residual intelligibility in the <b>scrambled</b> <b>speech</b> and are easy to break. Typically, a speech scrambling algorithm involves permutation of speech segments in time, frequency or time-frequency domain or permutation of transform coefficients of each speech block. The time-frequency algorithms have given very low residual intelligibility and have attracted much attention. We first study the uniform filter bank based time-frequency scrambling algorithm with respect to the block length and number of channels. We use objective distance measures to estimate the departure of the <b>scrambled</b> <b>speech</b> from the clear speech. Simulations indicate that the distance measures increase as we increase the block length and the number of chan­nels. This algorithm derives its security only from the time-frequency segment permutation and it has been estimated that the effective number of permutations which give a low residual intelligibility is much less than the total number of possible permutations. In order to increase the effective number of permutations, we propose a time-frequency scrambling algorithm based on wavelet packets. By using different wavelet packet filter banks at the analysis and synthesis end, we add an extra level of security since the eavesdropper has to choose the correct analysis filter bank, correctly rearrange the time-frequency segments, and choose the correct synthesis bank to get back the original speech signal. Simulations performed with this algorithm give distance measures comparable to those obtained for the uniform filter bank based algorithm. Finally, we introduce the 2 -channel perfect reconstruction circular convolution filter bank and give a simple method for its design. The filters designed using this method satisfy the paraunitary properties on a discrete equispaced set of points in the frequency domain...|$|E

Prior research on the ISE has focused on short-term memory for visually-presented word lists. The present research extends this work by using measurements of eye movements to examine effects of irrelevant background speech during Chinese reading. This enabled an examination of the ISE for a language in which access to semantic representations is not strongly mediated by phonology. Participants read sentences while exposed to meaningful irrelevant <b>speech,</b> meaningless <b>speech</b> (<b>scrambled</b> meaningful <b>speech)</b> or silence. A target word of high or low lexical frequency was embedded in each sentence. The results show that meaningful, but not meaningless, background speech produced increased re-reading. In addition, the appearance of a normal word frequency effect, characterised by longer fixation times on low compared to high frequency words, was delayed when meaningful or meaningless speech was present in the background. These findings show that irrelevant background speech can disrupt normal processes of reading comprehension and, in addition, that background noise can interfere with the early processing of words. The findings add to evidence showing that normal reading processes can be disrupted by environmental noise such as irrelevant background speech. Peer-reviewedPost-prin...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- The {{security}} {{problem of}} speech communication {{has always been}} a demanding problem in military and business areas. A common approach to realizing end-to-end security is the use of a scrambler. Most of the scramblers are based on permutation of speech signals in the time domain and/or frequency domain. On the other hand, descramblers are used to eavesdrop information from <b>scrambled</b> <b>speech</b> signals. In this paper we propose a new approach to implement a descrambler. We treat the descrambling problem as a puzzle solving problem. In this considered puzzle problem, each piece is a rectangular-shaped gray scaled image puzzle.

Moreover, nobody can comprehend the partial speech content from speech signals scrambled with these methods. In this paper, we propose a semi-scramble method for speech signals based on phonemic restoration. By using a speech scrambling method based on the random-bit shift of quantization bits, speech signals are converted to scrambled signals in partial intervals. We evaluated the confidentiality and efficiency of the proposed method by using two objective measures, signal-to-error ratio (SER) and perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ). As a result, we confirmed that the proposed method can play a role in copyright protection for an original signal and recover a semi-scrambled speech signal into the original one. Finally, we indicated that the acoustic characteristics of signal semi-scrambled with the proposed method enable the listener to understand the speech information...|$|E
40|$|Analog speech {{scrambling}} systems, {{as opposed to}} purely digital encryption systems, have existed since the 1920 s. Analog {{speech scrambling}} technology has a checkered past with respect to security. Modern analog speech scrambling systems have successfully tackled the issues of security by using new technological methods that have been borrowed from high fidelity digital audio bit rate reduction systems, namely MPEG audio. The modern technological method of making speech over analog circuits secure involves digitizing speech and manipulating the digitized speech in the frequency and time domain by using digital encryption methods. These methods are in step with psychoacoustic research on secure voice transmission systems. The psycho-acoustical processing of digital audio coupled with digital encryption methods is adequate to make scrambled audio extremely unintelligible under normal telecommunications conditions. Most importantly, {{it is possible for}} people with modest engineering and design talents to design a secure analog voice scrambling system because international standards and common design principals aid in the construction of such telecommunications products. Analog <b>scrambled</b> <b>speech</b> systems have been around for at least 80 years.

50|$|A {{disadvantage}} {{of the original}} NMT specification is that voice traffic was not encrypted, therefore {{it was possible to}} listen to calls using e.g. a scanner. As a result, some scanners have had the NMT bands blocked so they could not be accessed. Later versions of the NMT specifications defined optional analog scrambling which was based on two-band audio frequency inversion. If both the base station and the mobile station supported scrambling, they could agree upon using it when initiating a phone call. Also, if two users had mobile (phone) stations supporting scrambling, they could turn it on during conversation even if the base stations didn't support it. In this case, audio would be scrambled all the way between the 2 mobile stations. While the scrambling method was not at all as strong as encryption of current digital phones, such as GSM or CDMA, it did prevent casual listening with scanners. Scrambling is defined in NMT Doc 450-1: System Description (1999-03-23) and NMT Doc 450-3 and 900-3: Technical Specification for the Mobile Station (1995-10-04)'s Annex 26 v.1.1: Mobile Station with <b>Speech</b> <b>Scrambling</b> - Split Inversion Method (Optional) (1998-01-27).|$|R

5000|$|From the {{introduction}} of voice encryption to today, encryption techniques have evolved drastically. Digital technology has effectively replaced old analog methods of voice encryption and by using complex algorithms, voice encryption {{has become much more}} secure and efficient. One relatively modern voice encryption method is Sub-band coding. With Sub-band Coding, the voice signal is split into multiple frequency bands, using multiple bandpass filters that cover specific frequency ranges of interest. The output signals from the bandpass filters are then lowpass translated to reduce the bandwidth, which reduces the sampling rate. The lowpass signals are then quantized and encoded using special techniques like, Pulse Code Modulation (PCM). After the encoding stage, the signals are multiplexed and sent out along the communication network. When the signal reaches the receiver, the inverse operations are applied to the signal to get it back to its original state. A <b>speech</b> <b>scrambling</b> system was developed at Bell Laboratories in the 1970s by Subhash Kak and Nikil Jayant. In this system permutation matrices were used to scramble coded representations (such as Pulse Code Modulation and variants) of the speech data. Motorola developed a voice encryption system called Digital Voice Protection (DVP) as part of their first generation of voice encryption techniques. DVP uses a self-synchronizing encryption technique known as cipher feedback (CFB). The basic DVP algorithm is capable of 2.36 x 1021 different [...] "keys" [...] based on a key length of 32 bits." [...] The extremely high number of possible keys associated with the early DVP algorithm, makes the algorithm very robust and gives a high level of security. As with other symmetric keyed encryption systems, the encryption key is required to decrypt the signal with a special decryption algorithm.|$|R
