40|$|<b>Soil</b> <b>flushing</b> was {{included}} in the Deep Vadose Zone Treatability Test Plan for the Hanford Central Plateau as a technology with the potential to remove contaminants from the vadose zone. <b>Soil</b> <b>flushing</b> operates through the addition of water, and if necessary an appropriate mobilizing agent, to mobilize contaminants and flush them from the vadose zone and into the groundwater where they are subsequently captured by a pump-and-treat system. There are uncertainties associated with applying <b>soil</b> <b>flushing</b> technology to contaminants in the deep vadose zone at the Hanford Central Plateau. The modeling and laboratory efforts reported herein are intended to provide a quantitative assessment of factors that impact water infiltration and contaminant flushing through the vadose zone and into the underlying groundwater.

30|$|<b>Soil</b> <b>flushing</b> {{technology}} is an ‘in situ’ remediation technique involving the injection of a liquid solution. Applications of the <b>soil</b> <b>flushing</b> technique {{depend on the}} leachability of the pollutants and the environmental compatibility and total volumes of the solutions used. Therefore, experiments should consider these aspects by simulating the real phenomenon and using the most suitable reagents for the leachability of the different mineralogical forms present. Thirty-one laboratory tests were carried out (in batch and becker) to the complete exhaustion of the leaching capacity according to pH measurements. The reaction kinetics were studied by producing more than 300 solution samples during which the principal heavy metal concentrations, pH and Eh were measured. Leaching solutions containing various concentrations of hydrochloric, sulphuric, nitric and acetic acids were used. Mercury was leached using potassium iodide and acetic acid (pH 2). Analytes such as arsenic, cadmium, mercury, lead, selenium and zinc proved to be leachable in the investigated soil layer. However, high removal efficiencies could be obtained using different typological solutions, concentrations and volumes.

This paper presents a model specifically developed {{to evaluate the}} feasibility of chelating agent-enhanced flushing. The model, here applied to the remediation of real Pb-contaminated soils, was conceived also to simulate an innovative pulse-mode <b>soil</b> <b>flushing</b> technique. Materials and methods: The <b>soil</b> <b>flushing</b> application was firstly carried out through columns laboratory experiments. Columns were filled with a real Pb-contaminated soil (3, 000 mg kg− 1 of dry soil) and flushing was operated in a pulse mode with different chelating agent dosages (3 and 4. 3 mmol kg− 1 soil). Experimental results were used to calibrate and validate the developed reactive transport model that accounts for transport of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and EDTA–Pb chelate complexes, Pb residual concentration on soil and the reduction in permeability by soil dissolution. Determination of hydrodynamic and hydrodispersive parameters was carried out through a numerical approach incorporating the use of neural network as interpolating function of breakthrough data obtained by a tracer test.

40|$|Despite {{the overall}} high {{efficacy}} of cyclodextrins {{to accelerate the}} treatment of soil aquifer remediation by in-situ <b>soil</b> <b>flushing,</b> the use in practice remains limited {{because of the high}} costs of cyclodextrin and high concentrations needed to significantly reduce the treatment time. The current study tested the potential of activated carbon to treat washing water originating from <b>soil</b> <b>flushing</b> in order to selectively separate hydrocarbon contaminants from washing water containing cyclodextrin and subsequently reuse the cyclodextrin solution for reinfiltration. A high recovery of the cyclodextrin from the washing water would reduce the costs and would make the technique economically feasible for soil remediation. This study aimed to investigate whether cyclodextrin can pass through the activated carbon filter without reducing the cyclodextrin concentration when the contaminated washing water is treated and whether the presence of cyclodextrin negatively affects the purification potential of activated carbon to remove the organic pollutants from the pumped soil water. Lab-scale column experiments showed that with the appropriate activated carbon 100 % of cyclodextrin (randomly-methylated-β-cyclodextrin) can be recovered from the washing water and that the effect on the efficiency of activated carbon to remove the hydrocarbon contaminants remains limited. These results show that additional field tests are useful to make in-situ <b>soil</b> <b>flushing</b> with cyclodextrin both a technical and an economical interesting technique.

30|$|Salinity is {{one major}} {{limiting}} factor to plant growth and crop productivity [1]. Cultivated soils worldwide {{are becoming more}} saline from marginal irrigation water, excessive fertilization, and desertification processes. Currently, more than 800 million hectares of land throughout the world are affected by levels of salt that could substantially reduce crop productivity [2]. Strategies for alleviation of salt stress involve developing salt-resistant cultivars, leaching excess soluble salts from upper to lower <b>soil</b> depths, <b>flushing</b> <b>soils</b> that contain soil crusts at the surface, reducing salt by harvesting salt-accumulating aerial plant parts in areas with negligible irrigation water or rainfall for leaching, and amelioration of saline soils under cropping and leaching [3]. An alternative is to alleviate salt stress by inoculating crop seeds and seedlings with plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB). Looking into the perspectives of crop production losses due to the severity of abiotic stresses, especially salinity, tolerance to stress provided by microbial inoculants becomes more important. Beneficial effect of PGPB under salinity has been related to hydraulic conductance, osmolyte accumulation, sequestering toxic Na+ ions, maintaining higher stomatal conductance and photosynthetic activities [4].|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Nutrient loading in {{semi-arid}} streams during flood {{events may}} result primarily from <b>soil</b> <b>flushing</b> and transient bank storage. To test this hypothesis, eight soil lysimeters and two stream autosamplers were placed along a 500 m {{reach of the}} San Pedro River, Arizona, in summer 2001, alongside 45 piezometers we installed last spring. Flood samples were collected once to twice hourly, and soil water samples were collected {{within a few days}} after a flood. Samples were analyzed for conservative chemical tracers and dissolved nutrients. Nitrate concentrations were elevated (- 5 - 6 mglL) in some soil water samples from adjacent banks that became saturated during flood events; nitrate concentrations in baseflow and groundwater were often below detection (< 0. 01 mg/L). A simple mixing model indicated that soil water was flushed from the banks prior to and during peak flow, an occurrence that may be associated with elevated stream nitrate concentrations. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations exhibited a delayed response, but increased by- 3 mglL shortly after peak flow. These results corroborate that <b>soil</b> <b>flushing</b> may be a significant contributor of nutrients during floods, but the role of post-flood bank drainage may not be as important to the overall nutrient balance.

40|$|Velvetleaf, Abutilon theophrasti Medic., is an {{important}} arable weed worldwide. It is currently not present in the northern regions of Europe, but there are reasons why it may move northwards: The weed has not reached {{the northern edge of}} its climatic range, increasing temperatures, caused by climate change, will create more suitable growing conditions in northern areas, or the weed will adapt to cooler habitats. Velvetleaf has an indeterminate growth, meaning that the reproductive output largely depends on the length of the growing season, which is determined by the timing of emergence and seed production. The purposes of this preliminary study were: 1) To evaluate the growth potential of A. theophrasti in the Northern German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and 2) to compare the phenology of populations from different European origins to evaluate the degree of adaptation to local climatic conditions. Forty 5 L pots were buried in the <b>soil</b> <b>flush</b> with the <b>soil</b> surface, 10 velvetleaf seeds of one of four populations from Spain, the Czech Republic, southern Germany or France were seeded in spring 2010 and subsequent emergence was recorded. In summer, plants were thinned to one seedling per pot and subsequent capsule production was recorded until the first frost. French and Spanish velvetleaf populations germinated earlier, produced capsules later, and tended to produce fewer capsules per plant than did populations from southern Germany or the Czech Republic. In addition, French and Spanish populations had a lower percentage of dormant seeds. These differences are in agreement with observations and predictions made for the northward expansion of velvetleaf in North America. Velvetleaf could grow and reproduce in northern Germany but further phenological changes, in particular a shorter growing season, a higher reproductive output and a higher level of physical dormancy, are to be expected as adaptations to local climatic conditions...|$|R
