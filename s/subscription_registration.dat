40|$|In content networks, {{messages}} are routed {{on the basis}} of their content and the interests (subscriptions) of the message consumers. This form of routing offers an interesting alternative to unicast or multicast communication in loosely coupled distributed systems with large number of consumers, with diverse interests, wide geographical dispersion, and heterogeneous resources (e. g., CPU, bandwidth). In this paper, we propose a novel protocol for content-based routing in overlay networks. This protocol guarantees perfect routing (i. e., a message is received by all, and only those, consumers that have registered a matching subscription) and optimizes the usage of the network bandwidth. Furthermore, our protocol takes advantage of subscription aggregation to dramatically reduce the size of the routing tables, and it fully supports dynamic <b>subscription</b> <b>registrations</b> and cancellations without impacting the routing accuracy. We have implemented this protocol in the application-level routers of an overlay network to build a scalable XML-based data dissemination system. Experimental evaluation shows that the size of the routing tables remains small, even with very large populations of consumers...|$|R

40|$|Using a {{simplified}} NEG model, we investigates {{the relation between}} labor diversity and agglomeration. In the theoretical part, we assume the following two-region model. Homogenous consumption goods are produced using a constant returns technology with homogenous capital and heterogenous workers. The production function exhibits increasing returns to scale in labor diversity. Capital is freely mobile between the regions, while workers are immobile but can commute to the other region by paying the commuting cost. Considering the circular causation in this model, the backward linkage (i. e. agglomeration caused by labor demand) implies the agglomeration of capital leads workers to concentrate. The forward linkage (i. e. agglomeration caused by labor supply) implies {{the increase in the}} number of workers enhances labor diversity and causes agglomeration of capital. The theoretical result is summarized as follows. When interregional commuting cost is sufficiently low, workers tend to choose their jobs in the region with a larger share of capital. Furthermore, the inflow of commuting workers increases the degree of labor diversity in the labor receiving region, and causes agglomeration of capital. In the empirical part, we confirm the theoretical results by covariance structure analysis with Japanese prefectural datas. We construct path diagrams describing the above backward and forward linkages. In order to measure the latent factor of labor diversity, we use following six indices: newspaper <b>subscription,</b> car <b>registration,</b> votes share in national election, foreign travel, white-collar share, and interregional commute. As an empirical result, we reveal the existence of the circular causation in Japan. Concretely, on the backward linkage, capital agglomeration (the number of firms) has a significant and positive indirect effect on labor agglomeration (the number of workers) through the wage income of workers, as well as a direct effect on labor agglomeration. The forward linkage is also positive and significant. Labor agglomeration significantly enhances the labor diversity, and the labor diversity raises capital reward (firms 8 ̆ 1 f profit) and leads capital (firms) to agglomerate. Besides, the labor diversity is strongly and significantly influenced by the indices of the car registration, the foreign travel, and the white-collar share. The empirical analysis in Japan supports the theoretical result that labor diversity causes agglomeration through the circular causation...|$|R
40|$|Gaston Zongo, former Executive Director of the Acacia Initiative (email: mailto:gzongo@sentoo. sn gzongo@sentoo. sn), {{explains}} why multipurpose community telecentres (MCTs) have succeeded or failed, {{and where they}} are headed. Can you give a short description of MCTs? MCTs are shared information and communication facilities for people in rural and isolated areas. They usually offer basic communication services such as telephone, fax, typing, photocopying, printing, training in the use of computers, email and electronic networking. What is the background to MCTs? MCTs are key strategic interventions by international donors to help bridge Africa´s digital divide. The main programme in this area is a joint initiative co-funded by ITU, IDRC/Acacia and UNESCO, in partnership with local NGOs and the national telecommunication operators. The countries that have benefited from the programme´s pilot phase include Benin, Mali, Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda. Many other international aid agencies have joined the movement, including USAID-Leland, the I-Earn-supported Songhai Centre in Benin, the francophone Multimedia Centres, and the WorldLinks for Development initiative in Zimbabwe. What is the rationale behind MCTs? It´s a commonly shared vision by researchers that integrating rural development and universal access to ICT tools can empower disadvantaged communities and address sustainable development issues. That´s why evaluating the impact of MCTs on the social and economic development of communities is so important. The Evaluation and Learning System for Acacia (ELSA) has been instrumental in this respect, leading to the definition of various indicators and evaluation guidelines, the organization of seminars and workshops, and ongoing online discussions and forums. What has been the outcome of evaluations so far? Many pilot MCT projects have failed because of common problems such as illiteracy, language barriers, low incomes, and the lack of or expensive power supplies. Another key problem has been that various projects have focused on the technology and infrastructure rather than on the content. This is not surprising considering the selected areas are usually under-served by national telecommunication networks and require an investment of more than ? 500, 000 per MCT. That´s way above the annual GDP of the MCT´s service area?and beyond the management capability of the targeted community. Also, using a philanthropic rather than maket-oriented approach, developers have not paid enough attention to the scalability and cost-recovery aspects of MCTs. It would have been better to apply the ´village bakery´ model, in which investors from African villages build local, scalable bakeries and set a price for the bread that local people can afford. MCTs that have been designed to deliver specific services to a given community, and are operated by the community, have proven to be the most successful. Examples include ENDA-Ecopole´s Cyberpop projects, in which community access is designed to help women with their fishing business. A final stumbling block has been African governments. Contributions from governments have rarely gone beyond the provision of premises, and no important long-term measures have been taken to support MCT initiatives. The sustainability of MCTs has also been dramatically jeopardized by the recent reforms of the telecommunication sector. They have reduced the financial capacity of the incumbent operators to invest in rural areas or {{to do something about the}} high costs of line subscriptions and connection charges. Where have MCTs succeeded? They have helped raise awareness at various levels, resulting in a greater commitment of African governments to bridge the digital divide. Africa is strongly backed by donor agencies and the international private sector. There is a clear global trend to enhance community access to ICT tools through software with low access costs. The Indian Simputer, a low-cost, hand-held computer based on Open Source software, is a good example. It is an alternative to the PC that allows people to use simple icons to get information via the Internet, and thus overcomes problems such as language barriers and illiteracy. Many African countries have already indicated their interest in introducing the Simputer for disadvantaged communities. In countries such as Burkina Faso, Mali, Rwanda, Senegal and Uganda, private cybercafé owners are moving into the rural areas because of the fierce competition in urban centres. Meanwhile, many post office companies are planning to transform their rural premises into cybercafés, emulating countries like Brazil and China. These positive developments are supported by continuing World Bank funding for rural telecommunications and new services like Uganda Telecom´s Freenet, which makes every landline an Internet line without the need for <b>subscription</b> fees or <b>registration.</b> In short, there are tremendous opportunities for the development of sustainable community access in Africa. The African governments are starting to define their e-government, e-governance, e-democracy and e-education strategies. And to ensure that most people will fully participate in these initiatives, the governments have started to draft new, nation-wide telecentre programmes to be implemented in partnership with the private sector, or at least using business-oriented models.
