5|$|Type Ia supernovae {{follow a}} {{characteristic}} light curve—the graph of luminosity {{as a function}} of time—after the event. This luminosity is generated by the radioactive decay of nickel-56 through cobalt-56 to iron-56. The peak luminosity of the light curve is extremely consistent across normal Type Ia supernovae, having a maximum absolute magnitude of about −19.3. This allows them {{to be used as a}} <b>secondary</b> <b>standard</b> candle to measure the distance to their host galaxies.|$|E
25|$|Although {{not defined}} by the pendulum, the final length chosen for the metre, 10−7 of the pole-to-equator {{meridian}} arc, {{was very close to}} the length of the seconds pendulum (0.9937 m), within 0.63%. Although no reason for this particular choice was given at the time, it was probably to facilitate the use of the seconds pendulum as a <b>secondary</b> <b>standard,</b> as was proposed in the official document. So the modern world's standard unit of length is certainly closely linked historically with the seconds pendulum.|$|E

40|$|Typically, small angle neutron {{scattering}} (SANS) data is normalized to an absolute scale using <b>secondary</b> <b>standards</b> such as water, polymers, silica gels, or irradiated aluminum. Errors for {{this method of}} calibration arise when the initial determination or calculation of the standard's scattering cross-section is no longer valid due to degradation or wavelength-dependent multiple scattering or detector efficiency effects. Here we illustrate how strong coherent scattering {{can be used to}} experimentally measure the incident neutron beam intensity and thus serve as a primary absolute calibration. We show how easily this procedure is implemented using a ternary microemulsion as a strong scatterer and compare its accuracy with some other <b>secondary</b> <b>standards</b> commonly in use. We find that the procedure is consistent with the other standards and should be considered a viable alternative when normalizing SANS measurements...|$|R
50|$|National {{standards}} laboratories {{such as the}} NPL provide calibration {{factors for}} ionization chambers and other measurement devices to convert from the instrument's readout to absorbed dose. The standards laboratories operate a Primary Standard, which is normally calibrated by absolute calorimetry, the warming of substances when they absorb energy. A user sends their <b>Secondary</b> <b>Standard</b> to the laboratory, where it is exposed to a known amount of radiation (derived from the Primary Standard) and a factor is issued to convert the instrument's reading to that dose. The user may then use their <b>Secondary</b> <b>Standard</b> to derive calibration factors for other instruments they use, which then become tertiary standards, or field instruments.|$|E
5000|$|Traceability is {{most often}} {{obtained}} by calibration, establishing the relationship between an indication on a measuring instrument (or <b>secondary</b> <b>standard)</b> {{and the value of}} the standard. Calibration is defined as an [...] "operation that, under specified conditions, in a first step, establishes a relation between the quantity values with measurement uncertainties provided by measurement standards and corresponding indications with associated measurement uncertainties (of the calibrated instrument or <b>secondary</b> <b>standard)</b> and, in a second step, uses this information to establish a relation for obtaining a measurement result from an indication" [...] by the Joint Committee for Guides in Metrology. The four primary reasons for calibrations are to provide traceability, to ensure that the instrument (or standard) is consistent with other measurements, to determine accuracy, and to establish reliability.|$|E

40|$|In this procedure, {{tentative}} calibration {{values are}} assigned to <b>secondary</b> <b>standards</b> by analysis of that material with the routinely used instrument calibrated by use of the former lot of material. Aliquots of serum from patients are then analyzed by the routine method and an appropriate calibration method in which primary standards are used. If the patient-sera results by both methods are the same, the assigned calibration value {{is assumed to be}} correct; if not, the calibration value of the secondary-standard material is adjusted to produce agreement in patient-sera results between the two methods. Thus, calibration of the routine method is linked via the calibration method to pri-mary standards as the criterion of accuracy. This approach corrects for matrix interference of serum-based <b>secondary</b> <b>standards.</b> All that is expected of the secondary standar...|$|R
30|$|Before {{performing}} analyses, the gamma detector was calibrated. In particular, {{energy and}} efficiency calibrations {{were obtained by}} means of calibrated sources such as multi-gamma radioisotopes, MRL 1654 and MRL 1655, from National Metrology Institute of Ionizing Radiations (INMRI, Italy), and single-gamma radioisotope, 152 Eu, from Comité a l’Energie Atomique (CEA, France). For INAA analysis, primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>standards</b> were irradiated and measured in the same conditions described above. A mixture (ranging between 10 – 200  μg of single element; each solution was obtained by dilution from 1  mg mL− 1 of mother solution of each one) of primary standards (Carlo Erba, Milan, Italy) was used. On the other hand, <b>secondary</b> <b>standards</b> were USGS GRX- 4 (i.e., rock) and USGS G- 2 (i.e., granite) (United States Geochemical Survey). The uncertainty of the methodology was tested measuring the <b>secondary</b> <b>standards</b> with solution of primary standards at different concentrations; the repeatability of measurements on obsidian matrix was tested by analyzing seven times, at different cooling times and with different measurement times, an obsidian sample coming from the Procida deposit. Finally, interferences due {{to the formation of}} radioisotopes measured as fission products (95 Zr, 6.50 %; 134 Cs, 0.028 %; 140 La, 6.30 %; 141 Ce, 5.78 %; 147 Nd, 2.30 %; 153 Sm, 0.27 %), have been evaluated and subtracted irradiating pure primary uranium standards.|$|R
