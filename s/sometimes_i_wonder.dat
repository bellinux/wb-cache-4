500|$|Ferguson's {{sense of}} what was [...] "right" [...] {{became the basis for}} the Beiderbecke Romantic legend, which has {{traditionally}} emphasized the musician's Iowa roots, his often careless dress, his difficulty sight reading, the purity of his tone, his drinking, and his early death. These themes were repeated by Beiderbecke's friends in various memoirs, including The Stardust Road (1946) and <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>Wonder</b> (1965) by Hoagy Carmichael, Really the Blues (1946) by Mezz Mezzrow, and We Called It Music (1947) by Eddie Condon. Beiderbecke was portrayed as a tragic genius along the lines of Ludwig van Beethoven. [...] "For his talent there were no conservatories to get stuffy in, no high-trumpet didoes to be learned doggedly, note-perfect as written," [...] Ferguson wrote, [...] "because in his chosen form the only writing of any account was traced in the close shouting air of Royal Gardens, Grand Pavilions, honkeytonks, etc." [...] He was [...] "this big overgrown kid, who looked like he'd been snatched out of a cradle in the cornfields," [...] Mezzrow wrote. [...] "The guy didn't have an enemy in the world," [...] recalled Beiderbecke's friend Russ Morgan, [...] "ut he was out of this world most of the time." [...] According to Ralph Berton, he was [...] "as usual gazing off into his private astronomy," [...] but his cornet, Condon famously quipped, sounded [...] "like a girl saying yes." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes!" [...] he {{answered}} shortly, [...] "he is about. He is everywhere. The little brute haunts me! He dogs my footsteps, Wrayson. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> that I don't sweep {{him off the}} face of the earth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope I shall {{continue}} to work," [...] she answered, [...] "but even work is an uncertain proviso. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> why God inconveniences the ordinary mortal with an imagination.

6000|$|... "I don't {{know whether}} I quite like it," [...] said Lydia. [...] "It seems like hypocrisy. It used to worry me. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> if <b>I</b> had any real self. I {{seemed to be}} just what people made me, and a {{different}} person to each." ...|$|R
60|$|And oh, there was! But <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> uneasily, feeling almost conscience-stricken, {{whether it}} were wholly because Hester had left me--whether it were no partly because, {{for a second}} time, I had shut the door of my heart {{in the face of}} love at her bidding.|$|R

He hates me--always has done, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> whether he doesn't hate you too!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{carnival}} mood," [...] {{she repeated}} thoughtfully, [...] "yes, that expresses it. We are light, {{we are always}} {{trying to get away}} from ourselves, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> whether there are any selves to get away from. You ought to atop us," [...] she added, almost accusingly, [...] "to bring us to our senses." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen," [...] he said earnestly, [...] "Dane {{has always}} {{suspected}} me. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> have <b>wondered</b> whether he hadn't the truth {{at the back}} of his head. You can make me safe forever." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I do not know," [...] Louise sighed. [...] "I {{only know}} that when I first talked to him, he seemed {{different}} from any man I have ever spoken with in my life. I suppose there are few temptations up there, and they keep nearer to the big things. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder,</b> Sophy, {{if it was not}} very wrong of me to draw him away from it all!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Children {{are not at}} {{all like}} puppies, I have said. But do puppies care only for play? That wistful look, which the merriest of them <b>sometimes</b> wear, <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> whether it means {{that they would like to}} hear about the good puppies? ...|$|R

[...] "But, say--say, I wonder why--Somehow, I haven't enjoyed Oxford {{and the rest}} of the places like I ought to. See, I'd always thought I'd be simply nutty about the quatrangles and stuff, but I'm afraid they're too highbrow for me. I hate to own up, but <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> if I can get away with this {{traveling}} stunt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{shadow of}} a dead man, I think," [...] {{answered}} Asti grimly. [...] "Some jealous god has looked upon this poor King whose crime is that he desires you, and therefore he must die. Of a truth it goes ill with your lovers, O Star of Amen, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> if one who is dear to me will meet with better fortune at those royal eyes of yours. If ill befalls him I think that at the last I may learn to hate you, whom from the first I cherished." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} miserable Geoffrey, with an effort, [...] "even if you don't {{care much about}} the child yourself, {{it is a little}} {{unreasonable}} to object because she cares for me and was sorry when she thought that I was dead. Really, Honoria, <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> if you have any heart at all. Why should you be put out because Effie got up early to come and see me?--an example which I must admit you did not set her. And as to her shoe----" [...] he added smiling.|$|E

6000|$|... "In {{the first}} days of the war," [...] he said, [...] "a flag flew there in sight of the place where George Washington lived and died. I used to watch that flag, and thank God that Washington had not lived to see it. And <b>sometimes,</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> if God had allowed it to be put in irony just there." [...] His voice seemed to catch. [...] "That was wrong," [...] he continued. [...] "I should have known that this was our punishment--that the sight of it was my punishment. Before we could become the great nation He has destined us to be, our sins must be wiped out in blood. You loved that flag, Virginia. You love it still.|$|R

6000|$|... "It's horribly lonesome up here," [...] he confessed. [...] "Sometimes I think I'll {{give it all}} up {{and go back to}} civilization. When I {{came here}} the pass had its traffic; now no one rides it, which is lucky for me," [...] he added. [...] "I have no prying visitors--I mean no one to contest my claim--and yet a man can't do much alone. Even if my ore richens I must {{transport}} it or build a mill. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> what I'm living for, stuck away in this hole in the hills. I was born to better things--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's the infernal {{atmosphere}} of this place," [...] Ezra said impatiently. [...] "I feel it myself <b>sometimes.</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> you don't start a little country seat with some grounds. Just {{enough to ask}} a fellow to shoot over, and with a good billiard board, and every convenience of that sort. It would do for us to spend the time from Saturday to Monday, and allow us to get some fresh air into our lungs. There are plenty of men who can't afford it half as well, and yet have something of the sort. What's the use of having a good balance at your banker's, if you don't live better than your neighbours?" ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Barrymore is of {{interest}} to me. She is a heavy, solid person, very limited, intensely respectable, and inclined to be puritanical. You could hardly conceive a less emotional subject. Yet I have told you how, {{on the first night}} here, I heard her sobbing bitterly, and since then I have more than once observed traces of tears upon her face. Some deep sorrow gnaws ever at her heart. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> if she has a guilty memory which haunts her, and sometimes I suspect Barrymore of being a domestic tyrant. I have always felt that there was something singular and questionable in this man's character, but the adventure of last night brings all my suspicions to a head.|$|E
60|$|She {{taught the}} Garibaldi song, moreover, {{to all the}} {{neighboring}} children, so that <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>wondered</b> if our street were not about to march upon Rome in a body.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{where you}} make a mistake. We're all {{inclined}} to say that everything is all right as long we aren't ourselves hurt. <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>wonder</b> if it is extinct--bullying." ...|$|R
6000|$|I am perpetually {{counting}} {{the weeks before}} me to be [...] "read" [...] through, and am perpetually longing {{for the end of}} them; and yet <b>I</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>wonder</b> whether <b>I</b> shall miss something when they are over.|$|R
