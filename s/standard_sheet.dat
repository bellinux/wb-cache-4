25|$|The CEE 7/16 <b>standard</b> <b>sheet</b> {{appears in}} Supplement 2 (June 1962) to the 1951 edition of CEE 7. The CEE7/16 {{unearthed}} plug {{is used for}} low power Class II applications, it has two round 4 by 19mm (0.157 by 0.748in) pins, rated at 2.5 A. There are two variants.|$|E
25|$|This Danish {{standard}} plug {{is described}} in the Danish Plug Equipment Section 107-2-D1 <b>Standard</b> <b>sheet</b> (SRAF1962/DB 16/87 DN10A-R). Unlike the French CEE7/6 plug, the earthing pin is on the plug, not in the socket. The Danish socket need not be recessed to protect the earthing pin. The Danish standard provides for sockets to have child-resistant shutters.|$|E
25|$|In Norway {{and parts}} of Sweden a 25 A {{grounded}} connector, rectangular shaped with rounded corners, is used for single phase stoves. The connector has three rectangular pins in a row, with the grounding pin longer than other two. The corresponding socket is recessed to prevent shocks. The Norwegian standard is NEK502:2005 - <b>standard</b> <b>sheet</b> X (socket) and sheet XI (plug). They are {{also known as the}} two pole and earth variants of CEE7/10 (socket) and CEE7/11 (plug).|$|E

25|$|About {{seventy percent}} of amate makers sell to wholesalers, with only the biggest {{manufactures}} having their own outside contracts. These larger concerns also produce {{nearly all of the}} output outside of the standard 60 by 40cm sheet. Each <b>standard</b> <b>sheet</b> costs about four pesos to make. High-quality paper by known artisans can sell for as high as USD $500 on the international market. The dependence on local wholesalers led to socio-economic stratification in the town, with the wholesalers receiving more profit off the paper than the producers. It is estimated that today about fifty percent of production ultimately goes to Nahua painters, with about {{seventy percent of}} the resulting paintings sold in Mexico. Amate paper sold internationally is generally used for arts, crafts, stationery and home décor.|$|E
50|$|It {{was defined}} by the German {{standards}} body DIN - Deutsches Institut für Normung (German Institute for Standardization) in the <b>standard</b> <b>sheet</b> DIN 1451-Schriften (typefaces) in 1931. Similar standards existed for stencilled letters.|$|E

5000|$|IEC 60320-2-2 Interconnection {{couplers}} {{for household}} and similar equipment. This section was withdrawn in January 2016. The general requirements for these items are now included in IEC 60320-1 and the <b>standard</b> <b>sheets</b> {{are part of}} IEC 60320-3.|$|R
50|$|To limit costs, Wright used {{standard}} Andersen {{windows and}} Pella doors, and designed the prefab {{to be built}} using <b>standard</b> <b>sheets</b> of plywood, Masonite and drywall. The exterior was to be painted Masonite with horizontal redwood battens attached, though the house could also be built of stone or concrete block, or partially faced with stone.|$|R
5000|$|IEC 60320-3: <b>Standard</b> <b>sheets</b> and gauges. [...] This part {{includes}} the <b>standard</b> <b>sheets</b> for both appliance couplers and interconnection couplers. For appliance couplers the various coupler outlines are designated {{using a combination}} of letters and numbers, e.g., [...] "C14". The female part connector supplies power to the male appliance inlet. The male part is designated by the even number one greater than the number assigned to the female part, so a C1 connector mates with a C2 inlet, and a C15A mates with a C16A. Interconnection couplers have single letter designators, e.g., [...] "F". They consist of two parts: a plug connector, which is the part integral with, or intended to be attached to, the cord, and an appliance outlet, which is the part integrated or incorporated in the appliance or equipment or intended to be fixed to it, and from which the supply is obtained.|$|R
50|$|The Digitar lenses are {{designed}} for use with digital imaging view camera systems, offering focal lengths ideal for the imaging area of digital backs, which are typically smaller than <b>standard</b> <b>sheet</b> film sizes. Digitar lenses also allow excellent results with film as well as digital imagers.|$|E
5000|$|Each type of coupler is {{identified}} by a <b>standard</b> <b>sheet</b> number. For appliance couplers {{this consists of}} the letter [...] "C" [...] followed by a number, where the <b>standard</b> <b>sheet</b> for the male appliance inlet is 1 higher than the sheet for the corresponding female cable connector. Many types of coupler also have common names. The most common ones are IEC connector for the common C13 and C14, the figure-8 connector for C7 and C8, and cloverleaf connector or Mickey Mouse connector for the C5/C6. Kettle plug is a colloquial term used for the high-temperature C16 appliance inlet (and sometimes, wrongly, for the mating C15 female connector). [...] "Kettle plug" [...] is sometimes mistakenly {{used to refer to}} regular temperature-rated C13 and C14 connectors, which should not be used with heating appliances.|$|E

50|$|The classic pocket-sized mini-hardback Ladybird book {{measured}} roughly four-and-a-half {{by seven}} inches (11.5 cm by 18 cm).

5000|$|Fuji {{created a}} 4×5 {{system in the}} late 1990s called QuickChange, which is {{somewhat}} similar to a Grafmatic in principle.

Though not sold as such, these inserts can be reloaded {{a limited number of}} times with <b>standard</b> <b>sheet</b> film. Because, like Grafmatic or [...] "bag mag" [...] holders, the Fuji holders used sheet film of normal thickness, they offered higher image quality than the older [...] "film packs" [...] (see below), but never became widely popular before digital imaging brought much production of traditional large-format materials to a halt.|$|E
