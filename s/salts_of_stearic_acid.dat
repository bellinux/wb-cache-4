40|$|CdS {{nanoparticles}} {{were formed}} within LB films of either Cd <b>salts</b> <b>of</b> <b>stearic</b> <b>acid</b> (SA) or calix[8]arene (CA) by exposing the samples to H 2 S gas. A series of DC and AC electrical measurements were performed for both planar and sandwich structures {{over a wide}} range of frequencies. Exponential behaviour of the DC I-V characteristics of the sandwich structures is typical for electron tunnelling through multilayered LB films. The conductivity value decreases after formation of CdS nanoparticles in the film, which is believed to be caused by the reduced layer-by-layer film order. AC measurements show a traditional insulating behaviour for all kind of films studied. Formation of CdS clusters in the LB films resulted in the decrease in both the capacitance and AC conductivity, which can be interpreted by the drop in the polarisability in disordered LB films.

40|$|Soaps are {{the sodium}} salts or {{potassium}} <b>salts</b> <b>of</b> <b>stearic</b> <b>acids</b> {{or any other}} fatty acids. They are prepared by the saponification process, which is, reacting the oil which contain triglycerides with caustic soda (NaOH) to give the soap. However different oils have different composition of fatty acids which are responsible for different properties of soaps made out of them. In the present work 5 different types of oils are taken. They are blended in various ratios to prepare 14 different samples of soap. Different properties of these samples were analyzed to see which soap is the best one. The cleansing and lathering properties of all samples were compared. The blend of coconut oil and castor oil at 3 : 1 ratio is found {{out to be the}} best with 76. 8 % of TFM and 89. 46 % of yield. The best blend is analyzed for various properties and they were compared with that given in the literature. The saponification values, iodine values of coconut oil and castor oil were found out and these values were also found for the blend. It was found that the blend was having SAP value of 230. 4 and iodine value of 40 which are higher than the individual values. Thus soap prepared using blend of both these oils has better properties than the soaps prepared by individual oils...|$|R

Several supported nickel oxide catalysts with nickel loading up to 25 wt. % were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method and reduced using hydrogen.

40|$|Decreased {{membrane}} rigidity {{is one of}} {{the characteristics}} of malignant cells, resulting in part from the desaturation <b>of</b> <b>stearic</b> <b>acid</b> into oleic acid. In this study we investigated the influence <b>of</b> <b>stearic</b> <b>acid</b> on tumour cell inhibition in vitro and tumour development in vivo. <b>Stearic</b> <b>acid</b> inhibited the colony-forming ability of 4 out of 5 rat and two human tumour continuous cell lines in vitro. In contrast, the colony-forming ability of rat fibroblasts was not inhibited and that of human foetal lung fibroblasts was inhibited at a higher dose than that required to inhibit human tumour cell lines. Using a model of rat mammary carcinoma induced by nitroso-methyl urea (NMU) the subcutaneous injection <b>of</b> <b>stearic</b> <b>acid</b> at weekly intervals prevented tumour development in 5 to 10 rats. Using iodostearic acid twice weekly, 11 of 19 rats were alive and tumour free at week 22 whilst all of 14 animals injected with NMU alone had died of tumour by the 16 th week. The ratio <b>of</b> <b>stearic</b> to oleic <b>acids</b> in erythrocyte membranes was significantly reduced in the tumour-bearing rats, but was normal in tumour-free animals treated with <b>stearic</b> or iodostearic <b>acid.</b> These preliminary data indicate that <b>stearic</b> <b>acid</b> inhibits tumour development in rats...|$|R

The aim of the present study is to compare the effects of STA with those of oleic acid (OL) on markers of hemostasis. In a randomized crossover study, 50 men consumed si...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the thermal {{removal of a}} low molecular weight component in a stainless steel powder-binder compact. A two-component binder composed <b>of</b> <b>stearic</b> <b>acid</b> (SA) and polypropylene (PP) with widely different debinding temperatures was chosen as a model system. Thermogravimetric {{analysis was used to}} determine separately the debinding kinetics of SA. Strong evidence was found that the mechanism which determines the debinding rate is the diffusion <b>of</b> <b>stearic</b> <b>acid</b> in the polymer. The diffusion length is half the distance between neighbouring pores which allow the evaporation products <b>of</b> <b>stearic</b> <b>acid</b> {{to move out of the}} compact. The differences with debinding mechanisms in ceramic powder compacts are discussed. Upper thresholds of the activation energy of diffusion of SA in liquid and solid PP are calculated to be 70 and 122 kJ mol- 1, respectively. The diffusivity at T = 167 -degrees-C was estimated as 8 x 10 (- 9) cm 2 s- 1. status: publishe...|$|R
