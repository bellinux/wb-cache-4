40|$|<b>Spontaneous</b> <b>cover</b> {{cropping}} is {{a common}} practice in Mediterranean vineyards because it is often seen as less competitive and easier to manage than sown covercrops. However, the services provided by the spontaneous flora highly depend on the species, these latter being influenced by the soil management practices. This study analyzes the specific and functional composition of the vineyard flora as influenced by three soil management strategies. To do so, weed cover was sampled at 5 dates during {{two years after the}} settlement of the experiment in a vineyard in the South of France. The three soil management treatments were: a control treatment (C) corresponding to a <b>spontaneous</b> <b>cover</b> regularly mowed, a <b>spontaneous</b> <b>cover</b> with organic amendment application each year (OF) and a green manure (Vicia faba) sown in autumn and incorporated at budburst (GM). 122 different species corresponding to 27 families, were identified (25 to 41 different species per treatment at a date), with only five species in more than 50 % of the quadrats, while a majority of species, 85 out of 122 were present in less than 10 %. The functional approach allows characterizing spontaneous vegetation according to species trait values and the ecosystem services they may provide: for example, the species being uncompetitive for vineyards while improving soil fertility are Crepis foetida and Lactuca serriola. On the contrary, species such as Geranium rotundifolium are more competitive and less interesting for soil fertility. This study contributes to a first identification of the soil management practices that can drive the trajectories of the spontaneous flora towards the best composition, hereby contributing to design more sustainable grapevine systems...|$|E

In this study, we measured biodiversity indices for <b>spontaneous</b> grass <b>cover</b> in two olive orchards with contrasting site conditions and management regimes in order to evaluate the potential for biodiversity metrics to serve as an indicator of soil degradation. In addition, the differences and temporal variability of biodiversity indicators and their relationships with environmental factors such as soil type and properties, precipitation, topography and soil management were analysed. Different grass cover biodiversity indices were evaluated in two olive orchard catchments under conventional tillage and no tillage with grass cover, during 3 hydrological years (2011 – 2013). Seasonal samples of vegetal material and photographs in a permanent grid (4 samples ha − 1) were taken to characterize the temporal variations of the number of species, frequency of life forms, diversity and modified Shannon and Pielou indices. Sorensen's index showed strong differences in species composition for the grass covers in the two olive orchard catchments, which are probably linked to the different site conditions. The catchment (CN) with the best site conditions (deeper soil and higher precipitation) and most intense management presented the highest biodiversity indices as well as the highest soil losses (over 10 t ha − 1). In absolute terms, the diversity indices of vegetation were reasonably high for agricultural systems in both catchments, despite the fact that management activities usually severely limit the landscape and the variety of species. Finally, a significantly higher content of organic matter in the first 10 cm of soil was found in the catchment with worse site conditions in terms of water deficit, average annual soil losses of 2 t ha − 1 and the least intense management.

Over a period of four years, nitrate quantities were measured in the soil profile to a depth of 1. 5 m in order to evaluate the pollution risks to groundwater. The swards studied were perennial ryegrass, red clover, perennial ryegrass/red clover and <b>spontaneous</b> <b>cover.</b> These experiments were carried out before, during and after the set-aside period, i. e. also during the subsequent crop. Results show that the sowing of a set-aside cover before winter leads to a reduction in the leaching risks. Little nitrate generally remains in the sown plots; the highest quantities are measured after red clover: 26 +/- 10 kg NO 3 -N ha(- 1). As far as spontaneous covers are concerned, the quantities can be high and highly variable: 43 +/- 48 kg NO 3 -N ha(- 1). At the sowing of sugar beet, i. e. 4 months after the set-aside cover is destroyed, mineralisation of the incorporated covers has started: 17 +/- 11 kg NO 3 -N ha(- 1) for the perennial ryegrass and 96 +/- 19 kg NO 3 -N ha(- 1) for the red clover sown before winter.

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the {{microcatchment}} scale allows us to evaluate the real complexity of soil protection in fields, few studies have been carried out in olive groves. This paper explores, on annual and event scales, the hydrological and erosive patterns observed in an olive microcatchment of about 6. ha under non-tillage with spontaneous grass cover, where data series of runoff and sediment load have been measured in a contrasting hydrological period of over 5. years. Firstly, the features of the data series acquired in the study station and its temporal context were explored through statistical analysis (statistics, histograms and correlation test), the intensity-duration-frequency relationships and the annual values of MOPREDAS dataset (1946 - 2005). In addition, annual and seasonal patterns were checked through Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to characterize the impact of rainfall variability and management techniques. Events with return periods of under 3. years caused sediment loads between 7. 2 and 17. 0. Mg., which implies that very high soil losses can be expected from frequent events. Although the contribution of a few events to the annual runoff and sediment load is substantial, a different distribution characterized by prolonged rainfall periods and very high soil losses was observed for a >rainy year> 2009 - 2010 (with an accumulated frequency of annual rainfall close to 79 %). The PCA illustrated a seasonal pattern of events where low values of soil losses and sediment concentration were observed in spring. This is probably associated to lower soil moisture and to sediment being trapped by the grass cover. Finally, the minimal cost of the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>cover</b> for soil protection encourages its use, despite {{the fact that}} could be inefficient when inter-rill erosion is either not the main source of sediment in the catchment or it is not well-established. © 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|Trabajo presentado en la European Geosciences Union General Assembly, celebrada en Viena del 7 al 12 de abril de 2013. Mediterranean climate {{conditions}} -characterized by {{the concentration of}} the precipitation in the seasons of autumn and spring, the low temperatures in winter and extremely warm and dry summers- determine that ground cover by adventitious (or cover crop) vegetation shows significant seasonal and annual variability. In addition, its spatial variability associates also, partially, to water availability among the landscape. This is especially relevant in olive orchards, an agricultural system under high erosion risk in the region where the establishment of herbaceous cover has proved to improve soil protection reducing erosion risk, {{as well as the}} improvement of soil properties (Gómez et al., 2009). All these benefits are based on small scale studies where full ground cover by the cover crop is relatively easy to obtain. However, few information is available about the actual ground cover achieved at farm scale, although preliminary observations suggests that this might be extremely variable (Gómez and Giráldez, 2009). This study presents the preliminary results evaluating the spatial and temporal evolution of ground cover by adventitious vegetation (the preferred option by farmers to achieve a cover crop) in two commercial olive farms during 2 hydrological years (2011 - 2012). The study was conducted in two farms located in the province of Cordoba, Southern Spain. Both were olive orchards grown under deficit irrigation systems and present a gauge station where rainfall, runoff and sediment loads have been measured from the year 2005. The soil management in “La Conchuela” farm was based in the use of herbicide in the line of olive trees to keep the bare soil all year round, and the application of selective herbicide in the lane between the olive trees to promote the grown of graminaceae grasses. In addition, the grass is mechanically killed in June. In the another farm, “Arroyo Blanco”, the grass <b>spontaneous</b> <b>cover</b> is allowed until mid-spring in which is also mechanically killed by several tractor passes. Ground cover was evaluated by a field surveys (4 per year) in which the same areas were measured at an approximate density of 4 samples/ha. In each point, over a 0. 25 m 2 area ground cover was measured using photographs, then point measurements were interpolated using method of Inverse Distance Weighting methods, to generate continuous distribution maps. The spatial and temporal evolution of ground cover in both farms presented a notably different patterns in both farms. In “La Conchuela”, maximum values of cover can be reached in winter (61 %, Dec- 2011) while in “Arroyo Blanco”, the maximum values were observed during the spring (50 % May- 2011) and are dramatically lower in the seasons of summer and autumn. These differences are justified by the influence of the management, the precipitation regime and the soil qualities such as the depth. On the other hand, the large spatial variability of ground cover measurements in both catchments, with coefficients of variation between 41 and 167 %, was mainly led by the topography. In both farms the highest values of ground cover were found in those areas with deeper soils located in also in converging areas where surface runoff is concentrated. In the highest and shallowest area, soil management operations might improve the establishment of the vegetation as well as to address the growing in the most erosive periods. Finally, the impact of grass cover on the hydrological and erosive responses in the catchment is also discussed. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

This fact demonstrated the effectiveness of the vegetal cover in the protection of the agricultural soil against the erosion during extreme events. Also, for ML management, furrow erosion represented more than 60 % of the total soil loss, demonstrating the dominance of this type of erosion. Finally, it should be noted that this event represents the almost total loss of soil recorded in the experimental plots during the period 2012 - 2015; and this consequently shows the significant impact of extreme events on erosion rates in the Mediterranean region...|$|R

40|$|The soils of Mediterranean {{vineyards}} {{are usually}} managed with continuous tillage, resulting in bare soil, low infiltration and high soil erosion rates. Soil nutrients, such as nitrogen, {{could be lost}} dissolved in the runoff, causing a decrease in soil fertility on such degraded soils and producing eutrophication downstream. The influences of groundcover on the soil erosion processes and sediment yields in Mediterranean vineyards have been widely addressed. However, the runoff process itself, excluding the effect of raindrop impacts, has barely been studied. Thus, a field runoff simulator was built to assess runoff and nutrient losses under different soil management strategies in Central Spain.

Soil {{organic carbon}} (SOC) shows a {{considerable}} spatial variability at the field, farm or catchment scales. This complicates its {{use as an}} indicator for soil quality, and is an important drawback for the efficient evaluation of carbon sequestration schemes, or for the certification of carbon sequestration potential of agricultural soils at these scales. This is especially significant for olive orchards in Mediterranean environments. We hypothesize that the typical row crop configuration of olive orchards, with cover crops or bare soil in the inter-row areas,can explain a vast proportion of this variability. In addition agricultural activities and topography-driven erosion processes at different scales contribute to SOC variability. Given the complexity of this problem and the important experimental effort required to address it, there are to our knowledgefew studies that have addressed this issue, specifically in agriculturalsoils under Mediterranean conditions.

Professional caregivers completed the NVCL- 20 for 28 Korsakoff (KS) patients and 24 cognitively impaired chronic alcoholics (ALC). Their ratings were related to the Dalla Barba Confabulation Battery (DBCB), Provoked Confabulation Test (PCT), and standard neuropsychological tests. RESULTS: The categories of the NVCL- 20 have "good" to "excellent" internal consistency and inter-rater agreement. The KS patients confabulated more (both spontaneously and provoked), and more memory and orientation problems were observed. Correlations with neuropsychological test scores showed that confabulations were associated with memory deficits, but not with intrusions or tests of executive dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: The NVCL- 20 is the first instrument that includes items addressing spontaneous confabulation. Administration is reliable, valid and feasible in clinical practice, making it a useful addition to existing confabulating measures...|$|R
40|$|Behaviour (BEH) is {{interested}} {{in all aspects of}} animal (including human) behaviour, from ecology and physiology to learning, cognition, and neuroscience. Evolutionary approaches, which concern themselves with the advantages of behaviour or capacities for the organism and its reproduction, receive much attention both at a theoretical level and as it relates to specific behaviour. The journal Behaviour has its roots in ethology and behavioural biology (see historical note), in which the emphasis is not so much on how animals compare with humans under strictly controlled conditions (as in comparative psychology), but more on tracing the phylogeny and evolution of natural behaviour as shown under naturalistic or natural conditions. Specialized cognition and communication are part of this approach. Well-controlled laboratory experiments are needed and welcome, but {{by no means the only}} approach. Behaviour has a long tradition of publishing systematic observations of <b>spontaneous</b> behaviour. Behaviour <b>covers</b> the whole animal kingdom, from invertebrates to fish, and from frogs to primates. The study of animal behaviour remains vibrant and keeps attracting young, talented scientists, who will find Behaviour a journal with a quick turn-around time (we strive for first reviews within a month) read by a wide range of students and researchers of animal behaviour...|$|R
40|$|The {{productive}} {{performance of}} an olive orchard is strongly {{affected by the}} olive grower capacity in choosing, combining, and properly performing the several agronomical practices, such as fertilization, soil management, irrigation, also {{taking into account the}}ir environmental impact. On the other hand, such expertise is taken into consideration by the recent agricultural European Union policy which supports and encourages the use of production technologies aimed to preserve natural resources. Among agronomical practices, fertilization can induce a ready and effective vegetative-productive response in olive tree. A well balanced and appropriate fertilization should take into account some steady points:  real nutrient needs of olive trees along the different stages of plant life cycle;  soil nutrient availability and tree nutritional status;  synchronization between nutrient requirements by the plants (olive trees and, in case, cover crops) and their availability in soil volume where roots are present;  fertilization techniques and their efficiency;  soil management techniques (<b>spontaneous</b> or seeded <b>cover</b> crops, recycling of pruning material within the orchard, use of manure or compost) and water availability linked to natural conditions (rainfall) or irrigation practice. In the present report some practical suggestions for an appropriate mineral and organic fertilization are reported taking into account the different farm management system...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} into {{the environmental and}} economic impacts of different soil management strategies, <b>spontaneous</b> grass <b>cover</b> with and without gully control (SC/SCGC) or conventional tillage with and without gully control (T/TGC), based on the experimental results obtained in an 6. 1. ha olive crop microcatchment. Initially, 2. years of rainfall-runoff-sediment load data series, (34 events) recorded under the current management (SCGC), {{was used for the}} calibration of the AnnAGNPS model at event and monthly scales providing suitable adjustments of runoff, peak flow and sediment loads (. E>. 70,. r>. 0. 85). Ephemeral gullies were also identified using aerial orthophotography and field work. The module of the AnnAGNPS model for simulating ephemeral gully generation and the tillage operations based on a bibliographical review were used to compare different scenarios and to perform a 10 year-analysis. The results showed mean runoff coefficients of 10. 0 % for SC/SCGC and of 3. 2 % for T/TGC while the average sediment loads were 2. 0 t*ha - 1 *year - 1 (SCGC), 3. 5 t*ha - 1 *year - 1 (SC), 3. 3 t*ha - 1 *year - 1 (TGC) and 4 t*ha - 1 *year - 1 (T). Significant differences in sediment sources (rill/inter-rill erosion and ephemeral gullies) were evaluated between SC (46 % of gully contribution) and T (19 % of gully contribution), in order to optimize the environmental and economic effort required in each case. Finally, the annual costs associated with soil losses were estimated (< 1 €*ha - 1 *year - 1). SC was the most profitable alternative for soil management. Despite the additional reduction in soil losses of the SCGC approach, the higher cost of its implementation and the minor effect on yield losses in the medium term suggest that without additional support (such as subsidies for gully control measures), farmers would have not an obvious incentive to use it. © 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|Olive {{orchards}} {{located in}} mountainous or hilly landscapes in Southern Spain {{have been identified}} as one of the major sources of sediments for streams in the region. This paper presents a modeling study of the magnitude and spatial distribution of sources of sediment within a small 6. 1 ha olive orchard forming a microcatchment in a mountainous area. The model used was SEDD, which was calibrated using rainfall, runoff and soil erosion patterns monitored over a 3 -year period. Although the data series are incomplete, 46 events were observed. SEDD permitted an analysis of the erosive behavior and the sediment delivery ratio (SDR) in the catchment on an event scale. High variability in catchment responses was observed, due to differences in the characteristics of storms and the seasonal ground cover. A small group of two or three erosive events, occurring mainly in autumn, were responsible for most annual runoff and sediment loads, while the impact of <b>spontaneous</b> grass <b>cover</b> was apparent in events occurring in spring, where, despite high runoff depth, the sediment loss was low. This bimodal tendency justified the calibration of the SEDD model through the medians of β-values in both the periods September-January and February-June. The results of the calibration (E= 0. 97 and RMSE= 0. 03 tha- 1) confirmed the applicability of SEDD to predict soil loss in the microcatchment and to allow us to complete the data series. Although the annual mean of SDR in the catchment for the study period was 3. 8 %, high spatial variability was found in the geomorphological units identified, with SDR values between 0. 3 % and 21. 7 %. On the event scale, probabilities of 50 % for surpassing an SDR value of 10 % were calculated for only 6 % of the catchment area. The location of these most significant sources of sediment will permit the design of more efficient management plans in order to reduce sediment discharge into streams. © 2011 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Background: In this work, we {{aimed to}} gain {{insights}} into the contribution of soil bacteria to carbon sequestration in Mediterranean habitats. In particular, we aimed to use bacterial laccase-encoding genes as molecular markers for soil organic C cycling. Using rainfed olive farming as an experimental model, we determined the stability and accumulation levels of humic substances and applied these data to bacterial laccase-encoding gene expression and diversity in soils under four different agricultural management systems (bare soils under tillage/no tillage and vegetation cover under chemical/mechanical management). Materials and Methods: Humic C (> 104 Da) was subjected to isoelectric focusing. The GC-MS method was used to analyze aromatic hydrocarbons. Real-Time PCR quantification and {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} (DGGE) for functional bacterial laccase-like multicopper oxidase (LMCO) -encoding genes and transcripts were also carried out. Results: Soils under spontaneous vegetation, eliminated in springtime using mechanical methods for more than 30 years, showed the highest humic acid levels as well as the largest bacterial population rich in laccase genes and transcripts. The structure of the bacterial community based on LMCO genes also pointed to phylogenetic differences between these soils due to the impact of different management systems. Soils where herbicides were used to eliminate spontaneous vegetation once a year and those where pre-emergence herbicides resulted in bare soils clustered together for DNA-based DGGE analysis, which indicated a certain amount of microbial selection due to the application of herbicides. When LMCO-encoding gene expression was studied, soils where cover vegetation was managed either with herbicides or with mechanical methods showed less than 10 % similarity, suggesting that the type of weed management strategy used can impact weed community composition and consequently laccase substrates derived from vegetation decay. Conclusions: We suggest that the low humic acid content retrieved in the herbicide-treated soils was mainly related to the type (due to vegetal cover specialization) and smaller quantity (due to lower vegetal biomass levels) of phenolic substrates for laccase enzymes involved in humification processes. We also found that <b>spontaneous</b> vegetal <b>cover</b> managed using mechanical methods could be the best option for achieving C stabilization in rainfed Mediterranean agroecosystems...|$|R
40|$|Measurements of gullies and rills {{were carried}} out in an olive orchard {{microcatchment}} of 6. 1 ha over a 4 -year period (2010 - 2013). No tillage management allowing {{the development of a}} <b>spontaneous</b> grass <b>cover</b> was implemented in the study period. Rainfall, runoff and sediment load were measured at the catchment outlet. The objectives of this study were: 1) to quantify erosion by concentrated flow in the catchment by analysis of the geometric and geomorphologic changes of the gullies and rills between July 2010 and July 2013; 2) to evaluate the relative percentage of erosion derived from concentrated runoff to total sediment yield; 3) to explain the dynamics of gully and rill formation based on the hydrological patterns observed during the study period; and 4) to improve the management strategies in the olive grove. Control sections in gullies were established in order to get periodic measurements of width, depth and shape in each campaign. This allowed volume changes in the concentrated flow network to be evaluated over 3 periods (period 1 = 2010 - 2011; period 2 = 2011 - 2012; and period 3 = 2012 - 2013). The cumulative precipitation values were 610 mm, 219 mm and 406 mm for period 1, 2 and 3, respectively, whereas the sediment ratios of rill erosion to total sediment yield were 44 % and 118 %, respectively, with a negative value (as a result of the volume reduction of rills and gullies) in period 3 when the total load was equal to 0. 4 t ha- 1. The increased development of the gully network was associated to intense events with a return period of the maximum intensity in 30 minutes greater than 2 years. A high dependency on the sequence of events according to their intensity values could explain the sedimentary budget in the catchment. Most of the events generating runoff in the catchment could contribute to interrill and rill erosion, but only very intense events would allow the runoff to transport sediment to the outlet. In addition to the grass cover, control measures in the gullies would substantially improve the sustainability of the farm. These gullies are important sediment sources, particularly in autumn when there is no vegetation cover and intense rainfall events occur. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Under {{tropical}} climate, {{temperature and}} humidity are high. In the selection of species destined to ground cover plant, under no-till system, the amount and quality of plant residue should be considered. The objective was thus to evaluate the amount and quality of residues of different ground cover plants, produced in a short development period, under no-till system at the implementation stage in a dry-winter region. The experiment was conducted during the 1999 / 2000 cropping seasons at Experimental Farm of São Paulo State University-Botucatu (SP), on a Red Nitosol. The experimental design was organized as random blocks and four replicates. Plots consisted of : 1 - Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench (Guinea group), cultivars A, 2 - Sorghum bicolor (Guinea group), cultivars B, 3 - Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br., cultivars BN 2, 4 - Panicum dichotomiflorum Mix. and 5 - <b>spontaneous</b> vegetation. Ground <b>cover</b> plants were desiccated at 53 days after emergence, were evaluated for dry matter production, content and accumulation of macronutrients, and C/N ratio, in addition to chemical composition, sum of cations (Ca, Mg, Mn, K, and Na), and electric conductivity of plant extracts from the aerial part. Pennisetum glaucum in the summer season showed high potential for dry matter production, trash persistence, and nutrient recycling in a short development period. Panicum dichotomiflorum showed the possibility of yielding a grain harvest. Sorghum bicolor (cultivars A and B) was prominent as the most effective residue in neutralizing H+Al and regarding Ca and Mg accumulation in the soil profile...|$|R
