50|$|Bryophyllum fedtschenkoi is a low-growing, frost-tender {{perennial}} succulent that prefers dry, open ground. It {{grows to}} 10-12 inches (25-30 cm) as an untidy, low, rounded herb. The stems are round, smooth and lax with visible leaf scars, often bending {{to touch the}} ground where they produce roots and a new plant. Leaves are simple, fleshy, alternate, blue-green and oval or obovate <b>with</b> <b>fine</b> <b>scalloped</b> edges, the edges may turn pink or red under strong sunlight or drought conditions. The tubular flowers are carried in corymbs, often multi-layered in good conditions. Each flower has a short calyx edged with delta-shaped segments, the calyx is shorter than the tubular corolla. The corolla is an orange/coral/apricot colour. The flowers hang down. Commonly called ‘Lavender Scallops’ from the shape and colour of its leaves. It has few pests but may be susceptible to mealy bug or occasionally scale insects.|$|R

CASE: A 73 -year-old male presented with an asymptomatic, right, pulmonary, subpleural nodule detected by computed tomography during follow-up for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Fine needle aspiration cytology showed cellular smears with numerous single or loosely cohesive groups of spindle-shaped to round cells. The tumor cell nuclei were blunt ended (cigar <b>shaped),</b> <b>with</b> <b>fine</b> to fine-granular chromatin, prominent nucleoli and an irregular nuclear rim.

40|$|The {{surface shape}} of a {{machined}} part {{plays a significant role}} in affecting assembly performance. For example, surface variation on a deck face of a combustion engine block can impact the performance of the engine assembly, resulting in sealing problems and cam bore distortions. Control of such surface shape variation becomes a key enabler of high-precision machining and requires the characterization of surface <b>shapes</b> <b>with</b> <b>fine</b> lateral resolution. Past research on machined surface quality includes surface error characterization, flatness prediction, and error diagnosis. However, conventional metrology systems cannot capture the shape variation of large machined surfaces with sufficient lateral resolution due to the limited capability in measurement resolution and range. Recently, a new type of surface measurement system based on laser holographic interferometry (LHI) is made available for high-definition surface metrology. Such a measurement system can reveal shape variations of a large surface <b>with</b> <b>fine</b> resolution, providing opportunity for surface variation characterization and control. Using the LHI, this dissertation develops models and algorithms for surface shape variation characterization and reduction. Based on face milling, three research topics are addressed in this dissertation: 1. 	Characterization of surface variation induced by cutter-workpiece relative displacement: The surface patterns are extracted by modeling the impacts of cutting force variation on relative cutter-workpiece displacements and correlating such displacement with LHI measurements. 2. 	Characterization of surface variation induced by cutter-spindle deflection: The cutting force variation due to part geometry also causes the cutter-spindle to deflect, resulting in the surface variation along the cutter path. This research investigates the impact of cutter-spindle deflection on surface variation and develops algorithms for machine tool health monitoring. 3. 	Surface variation reduction: Based on the extracted surface patterns and derived cutting force models, a machining method for surface variation reduction is developed by optimizing cutting conditions and cutter path to redistribute cutting force real time. The research presented in this dissertation provides an in-depth understanding of the relationship between machined surface shape patterns and process conditions such as cutting forces and machine setup. The outcome of this research will lead to methodologies for cost-effective monitoring and control of surface variations...|$|R
40|$|Purple loosestrife was {{introduced}} to North America from Europe and Asia {{in the early to}} mid 1800 ’s. The seeds were carried in ship ballast and on livestock that were brought to this country for trade. Purple loosestrife was widely cultivated for its ornamental and pharmacological values. But this species can invade wetland habitats and result in negative im-pacts on the ecosystem. Such ecosystem effects include altered detritus decomposition and nutrient cycling. Also, purple loosestrife may displace native plant species, forming dense monotypic stands that reduce native plant species richness and diversity. Purple loosestrife has little value for wildlife as few species utilize the plant for a food source or shelter. Regulations Purple loosestrife is not listed as a federal noxious weed. It is listed as a state noxious weed in Arkansas and South Carolina, and a Class B noxious weed in Alabama and North Carolina. It is widely recognized as an invasive weed of wetlands. Description Vegetative growth Purple loosestrife is a perennial species that over-winters as a stem base. Plants are composed of numerous angled stems that grow to over 6 feet. The leaves are lance <b>shaped</b> <b>with</b> <b>fine</b> hairs, and are attached directly to the stems with-out petioles. Leaves can be opposite, whorled, or spiraled around the stem. Flowering/fruiting Purple flowers occur in axillary clusters that form a spike inflorescence. Each flower has 5 - 7 narrow, wrinkled purple pet-als. Flowering begins in late June and continues through September. It has been suggested that purple loosestrife can draw pollinators away from native plants, which may aid in this plants prolific seed production. A mature multi-stemmed plant, 1. 5 - 6 feet in height, may produce between two and three million seeds that can remain viable in the soil for many years. It takes approximately eight weeks from germination for purple loosestrife to flower. Dispersal mechanisms Seed move by drifting in moving water. Long-distance transport occurs when seeds become embedded in mud adhering to wildlife, livestock, humans, and vehicles. The weed spreads vegetatively by detached shoot and rootstock fragments...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe present, in details, {{a generic}} tool to {{estimate}} differential geometric quantities on digital shapes, which are subsets of Z^d. This tool, called digital integral invariant, simply places a {{ball at the}} point of interest, and then examines the intersection of this ball with input data to infer local geometric information. Just counting the number of input points within the intersection provides curvature estimation in 2 D and mean curvature estimation in 3 D. The covariance matrix of the same point set allows to recover principal curvatures, principal directions and normal direction estimates in 3 D. We show the multigrid convergence of all these estimators, which means that their estimations tend toward the exact geometric quantities on — smooth enough— Euclidean <b>shapes</b> digitized <b>with</b> <b>finer</b> and finer gridsteps. During the course of the chapter, we establish several multigrid convergence results of digital volume and moments estimators in arbitrary dimensions.

To conclude the exposition, we discuss their robustness to perturbations and noise in input data and we show how such estimators can detect features using scale-space arguments...|$|R
