40|$|Effects of {{different}} levels of salinity on survival, growth and gonadal development of Genetically Improved Farmed Tilapia (GIFT) were studied under laboratory conditions in glass aquarium, {{for a period of}} ten weeks. The initial individual size of the GIFT was 20. 23 ± 4. 45 and the salinity levels tested were 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 ppt. The highest survival of 87. 5 % was found in 0 ppt and the lowest 60. 5 % in 20 ppt. Though the survival decreased progressively with increased salinity, {{there were no significant differences}} (P> 0. 05) among 0, 5, and 10 ppt. Similar to what has been observed in survival, the specific growth rate (SGR %/day) also decreased as of 1. 30, 1. 24, 1. 08, 0. 90 and 0. 71, respectively, with the increased salinity of 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 ppt. The gonadal development was highest in 0 ppt with a GSI value of 3. 75 and lowest of 2. 01 in 20 ppt. In the second experiment, gonadal development and seed production performance of GIFT in brackishwater condition were investigated for a period of three months. Each of the three fine meshed hapas of 20 square meters made from nylon net was placed in a freshwater (0 ppt) and in a brackish water (10 - 15 ppt) pond of the Brackishwater Station (BS). GIFT of 65 g average weight from a single cohort were stocked into three hapas at a rate of 2 per m. The male vs female ratio was 1 : 3. The development of gonad was faster with the higher gonadosomatic index (GSI %) of 3. 85 % in freshwater condition than that of 2. 73 % in brackish water. Within three months of the study period, a total of 70, 510 and 44, 250 GIFT fry were produced respectively, in freshwater and brackishwater conditions.

40|$|The genetic {{improvement}} program of <b>silver</b> <b>barb</b> {{was conducted at}} the Pathumthani Fisheries Test and Research Center of Aquatic Animal Genetics Research and Development Institute, Thailand. Between 1998 and 2003 a mass selection program was practiced on the stock of <b>silver</b> <b>barb</b> from the Chao Phraya River, under the project Genetic Improvement of Carp Species in Asia, coordinated by The WorldFish Center. Over five generations, the selection line had significantly (P less than 0. 001) greater body weight {{than that of the}} control. The magnitude of the response in harvest weight, however, decreased after the third generation. The most likely reason is that it was due to the effects of inbreeding. Therefore, the {{genetic improvement}} strategy for <b>silver</b> <b>barb</b> was re-designed. The population that went through five generations of mass selection was refreshed by outcrossing with the local stock from the Mekong River, Thailand, following 22 diallel crosses. A total of 140 full sib family groups were generated by hypophysation technique. The full pedigree has been maintained and selection for increased body weight has been based on the population formed from the best performing individuals of four strain combinations in a complete diallel cross, involving Chao Phraya (C) and Mekong (M) strains. Animal model using Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) methodology was used to estimate genetic merit of individuals for selection and replacements. Data was collected over two generations in this newly established population. The main aim {{of the present study was}} to obtain preliminary estimates of genetic parameters for body traits in this population. Performance data collected on 3, 848 individual fish were analyzed using restricted maximum likelihood method applied to a multi-trait mixed model in Asreml. The heritabilities for body traits (weight, length, depth and width) ranged from 0. 25 to 0. 32 (s. e. 0. 08). The maternal and common environmental effects due to separate rearing of full-sib families before tagging accounted for a relatively large proportion of total variance (27 to 32 %). Pair-wise genetic correlations between body traits were very high (0. 70 to 0. 98). The phenotypic correlations among the studied traits were almost close to one. These results indicate that selection for one of the body traits can achieve substantial direct response in the selection criteria and would result in correlated changes in other measurements of fish performance. The realized response to selection calculated as a percentage of the control, ranged from 4 to 9 % for body traits. On-farm testing also showed that the selected fish had greater growth rate than the local strain under various culture conditions in Thailand.

To verify the impact of rice-fish culture, data gathered over eight experiments (1995 - 1999) at the Co Do experimental rice-fish station, Vietnam, were analysed through multiple regressions with rice yield and different yield components as the dependent variables. We used eight independent variables: season, water depth, rice variety, rice seeding rate, and the effective stocking density (ESD) of <b>silver</b> <b>barb,</b> Nile tilapia, common carp and snakeskin gourami. Season had the biggest impact on nearly all dependent variables. Rice yields in the wet season were on average 2. 42 t/ha lower as compared to the dry season. Higher water levels decreased the number of panicles/m(2) and the rice yield. The rice seeding rate affected the yield component variables, but had no impact on the rice yield. <b>Silver</b> <b>barb</b> feeding decreased the number of panicles/m(2) but this was compensated by an increased number of grains/panicle. Snakeskin gourami had a positive effect on panicles/m(2) and, together with common carp, on sink capacity, probably through improved nutrient cycling in presence of fish and improved nutrient uptake by the rice plant. Snakeskin gourami had a negative effect on the ripening ability, whereas Nile tilapia had a positive effect. Fish did not have any impact on the rice yield. Increased water level and reduced rice arable area, the main two requirements for rice-fish culture, result in lower rice yields from rice-fish systems as compared to monoculture systems. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Planthoppers and leafhoppers are {{important}} rice pests. We {{tried to find}} out whether a polyculture of <b>silver</b> <b>barb,</b> common carp and Nile tilapia could control hoppers in intensively cropped rice fields. We used the data of five rice-fish experiments conducted between 1995 and 1998 at the Co Do rice fish research station, Can Tho province, Mekong Delta, Vietnam. Our results showed that the number of Nilaparvata lugens (Stal), Sogatella furcifera (Horvath), Nephotettix virescens (Distant) and Recilia dorsalis (Motschulsky) was the same in fields with and without stocked fish. We concluded that the three stocked fish species are not able to control hopper numbers. Other, predatory fish species might be more effective in hopper control. status: publishe...|$|E
