50|$|Tillage {{is defined}} in farming as the {{disturbance}} of soil {{in preparation for a}} crop. Tillage is usually done to warm the <b>seed</b> <b>bed</b> up, to help dry the <b>seed</b> <b>bed</b> out, to break up disease, and to reduce early weed pressure. Tillage prior to planting adds cost per acre farmed and has not been shown to increase soybean yields significantly.|$|E

50|$|Secondary tillage {{produces}} finer {{soil and}} sometimes shapes the rows, preparing the <b>seed</b> <b>bed.</b> It also provides weed control throughout {{the growing season}} during the maturation of the crop plants, unless such weed control is instead achieved with low-till or no-till methods involving herbicides.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{noticed in the}} {{greenhouse}} of the "Instituto Agronômico de Campinas" that many species of plants developed poorly when planted in <b>seed</b> <b>beds</b> that have been repeatedly used without change of soil. In many cases even the seeds would not germinate in such <b>seed</b> <b>beds.</b> Experiments have showed that the; lack of normal plant development in these beds {{is the result of}} the increase in soil salinity. This salinity may be due to additions of fertilizers or to salts introduced in the ordinary applications of water. It was found that the soil solution had an osmotic pressure of 13. 5 athmospheres at the wilting point. The tests showed that common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) plants were more susceptible to the soil salinity than were the soybean and the corn plants. Floading of those <b>seed</b> <b>beds</b> several times resulted in the leaching of salts and the restoring of conditions favorable for normal plant growth...|$|R

5000|$|Tillage is the {{agricultural}} preparation of soil by mechanical agitation, typically killing the plants earlier in place. [...] This tilling {{can result in}} a flat <b>seed</b> <b>bed</b> or one that has formed areas, such as rows or raised beds, to enhance the growth of desired plants. It is an ancient technique with clear evidence of its use since at least 3000 B.C.E.|$|E
50|$|It is of {{note that}} many {{varieties}} actively benefit from being transplanted as severing the taproot encourages bushier root growth. Traditionally nearly all heading brassica are sown {{in a separate}} <b>seed</b> <b>bed,</b> thinned, and the best ones planted in a prepared bed after about 6-8 weeks. Many pests want to eat baby brassica; this in combination with its long growing season makes planting brassica from plugs a much easier option.|$|E
50|$|This {{innovation}} permitted {{farmers to}} have precise {{control over the}} depth at which seeds were planted. This greater measure of control meant that fewer seeds germinated early or late, and that seeds {{were able to take}} optimum advantage of available soil moisture in a prepared <b>seed</b> <b>bed.</b> The result was that farmers were able to use less seed, {{and at the same time}} experience larger yields than under the broadcast methods.|$|E

50|$|A false or stale <b>seed</b> <b>bed</b> is {{a useful}} weed control {{technique}} which involves creating a seedbed some weeks before seed is due to be sown. Preparation of such seedbed makes sure that any weed seeds that have been disturbed and brought to the soil surface during cultivation will thus {{have a chance to}} germinate, and can then be hoed off or eliminated {{with the use of a}} flame weeder before sowing of the actual crop is carried out.|$|E
50|$|Acacia oncinocarpa and Eucalyptus miniata, for example, and {{perennial}} herbs {{all have}} adaptive mechanisms that {{enable them to}} live in fire-prone areas of Australia. Both the acacia (a small spreading shrub) and eucalyptus (an overstorey tree) can regenerate from seeds and vegetatively regenerate new shoots from buds that escape fire. Reproduction and seed fall occur during the eight dry months. Due to the area’s frequent fires, the seeds are usually released onto a recently burnt <b>seed</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|E
30|$|The early ranchers, loggers, {{and farmers}} {{continued}} burning but for different objectives. Ranchers {{burned in the}} fall to increase livestock forage and remove competing woody shrubs and trees from grasslands (Biswell 1989). Loggers used fire to consume large amount of slash that was left on site after harvesting and this occurred in the fall or early winter (Fritz 1931, Stuart 1987). Farmers used fire in the fall to consume unusable crop stubble, to prepare mineral soil <b>seed</b> <b>beds,</b> and to remove vegetation to increase the area that could be cultivated.|$|R
30|$|At each site, {{the field}} {{experiment}} was arranged in randomized complete block design with five N fertilizer rates as treatments (0, 30, 60, 90 and 200  kg N ha− 1) as urea (46 - 0 - 0) and four replications. Plant spacing was 70  cm between rows and 30  cm between plants. The gross plot had three harvestable and two boarder rows (with 4.8  m length). Two plants in {{each end of}} the harvestable rows were used as boarder plants. <b>Seed</b> <b>beds</b> for maize planting in each location were prepared following farmers’ practice.|$|R
40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} Maricopa, Marana, and Glendale, Arizona in 2001 to measure cotton growth, yield, micronaire, and production costs in single and double <b>seed</b> line per <b>bed</b> systems on 32 and 40 inch beds. Canopy development was faster and canopy closure was greater in the double seed line than in the single seed line systems and was greater in the 32 inch than in the 40 inch row systems. At Maricopa, the single line 32 inch system yield of 1571 lbs. /A was significantly greater than the yields of the other seed line/row spacing systems. The yields of the single line 40 and the double line 32 inch systems {{were not significantly different}} at 1476 and 1411 lbs. of lint/A, respectively, and the yields of the double line 32 and the double line 40 inch systems also were not significantly different at 1411 and 1396 lbs. of lint/A, respectively. There were no significant lint yield differences at the Marana or Glendale location. At Marana, the lint yields were 1063 and 1066 lbs. /A for the single and double seed line 40 inch row spacing systems, respectively. At Glendale, the single and double seed line 38 inch row spacing systems yielded 1474 and 1551 lbs. of lint/A, respectively. In all 2001 experiments, there was a trend for reduced micronaire in the double <b>seed</b> line per <b>bed</b> systems compared to the single <b>seed</b> line per <b>bed</b> systems. At Maricopa, the average micronaire was 5. 0 and 4. 7 for the single and double <b>seed</b> line per <b>bed</b> 32 inch row system, respectively, and 5. 2 and 4. 9 for the single and double <b>seed</b> line per <b>bed</b> 40 inch row systems, respectively. At Marana, the micronaire was 4. 7 and 4. 5 for the single and double <b>seed</b> line per <b>bed</b> 40 inch row systems, respectively. At Glendale, the micronaire was 5. 1 and 4. 6 for the single and double <b>seed</b> line per <b>bed</b> 38 inch row systems, respectively. Production costs were similar for the single and double <b>seed</b> line per <b>bed</b> systems. Additional research will be conducted in 2002 to determine the optimum plant populations and in-row plant spacings for double <b>seed</b> line per <b>bed</b> production systems...|$|R
5000|$|... “No till” is the {{practice}} of planting seed directly into the ground without disturbing the soil prior to planting. This practice eliminates the tillage pass, saving the farmer the associated costs. Planting no-till places seed directly into a cooler and wetter <b>seed</b> <b>bed,</b> which can slow germination. This process is considered a good conservation practice because tilling disturbs the soil crust, causing erosion. The practice of no-till is currently on the rise among farmers in the midwestern United States.|$|E
50|$|Their {{seeds are}} often held in an {{insulated}} capsule, which opens only {{in response to}} and after the devastation of a bushfire. Once cooled down, the land becomes a freshly fertilised <b>seed</b> <b>bed.</b> Oils in the leaves tend to make the fire more severe and therefore more damaging to less attuned species, giving an evolutionary advantage to the eucalypts. Epicormic buds under the often thick bark of the trunk and branches are ready to sprout new stems and leaves after a fire.|$|E
50|$|Distinctly hairy {{when first}} produced, {{capsules}} are usually persistent, each with 4-5 compartments and around 5-10mm in diameter. These capsules are situated singularly on short, terminal side branches, distinguishable from Melaleuca spp. whose capsules clasp the stem in distinctive clusters. Encasing seeds in tough, woody capsules provides some protection from damage by predators or insulation from disturbances such as fire. Extreme desiccation or fire is needed, however, to open these capsules, allowing seeds {{to be released}} to germinate in the ash enriched <b>seed</b> <b>bed</b> after the first rains following the fire.|$|E
5000|$|Once {{the seeds}} to be grown have been chosen, they {{will require a}} period of {{stratification}} before they will germinate. Stratification is simply the process that imitates the period of dormancy that occurs during the winter after viable seed is produced by a mature tree. [...] Although {{this can be accomplished}} by refrigerating moist seeds from 30 to 90 days, most commercial nurseries in the northern United States sow the seeds directly into <b>seed</b> <b>beds</b> in the late fall to allow the seeds to stratify naturally over the winter. This method typically results in a higher percentage of germination than artificially reproduced stratification.|$|R
