5000|$|According to The Kentucky Encyclopedia, Crow began experimenting in 1835 at his Glenn's Creek Distillery in Woodford County Kentucky with a <b>saccharimeter</b> {{to measure}} sugar content. This litmus paper test to {{determine}} the mash acidity resulted in Crow's decision to age his [...] "Old Crow" [...] whiskey before selling it.|$|E
50|$|Polarimeters {{are used}} in the sugar {{industry}} for determining quality of both juice from sugar cane and the refined sucrose. Often, the sugar refineries use a modified polarimeter with a flow cell (and used in conjunction with a refractometer) called a <b>saccharimeter.</b> These instruments use the International Sugar Scale, as defined by the International Commission for Uniform Methods of Sugar Analysis (ICUMSA).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Saccharimeters</b> {{are used}} in food {{processing}} industries, brewing, and the distilled alcoholic drinks industry.|$|R

50|$|The room shows a {{collection}} of microscopes (compound, binocular, achromatic, inverted) (1730-1860) and attributes. A set of instruments for optical chemical analysis (1850-1900): a crystal goniometer, a polarimeter, a <b>saccharimeter,</b> a spectroscope, a bunsen burner, a solution tube, gas-discharge tubes. Devices to study, demonstrate and explain the physical qualities of light: prisms and lenses, a heliostat and carbon arc lamp (with clockwork)(1820-1870). A collection of applied optics: a camera, sextant, stereoscope, several telescopes, mechanical lantern slides, a repeating reflecting circle (?), a phantascope (two discs, one with slits, one with images, which when rotating in opposite directions create a cinematographic effect), a projection lantern (1770-1860). Several telescopes: achromatic telescopes (1770 and 1850) and a reflecting telescope (1830). Several electrostatical devices: batteries composed of leyden jars and electrical machines (1770-1800) {{that were used to}} generate electricity. A variety of electrostatic toys and experimentation kits (1770-1820) to amuse and educate the public. Some show cases still to do.|$|E
30|$|The {{quality of}} {{sugarcane}} juice was evaluated by soluble solid content (BRIX) and polarizable sugars (POL). The Brix values were obtained directly, using a digital densimeter with a precision of 0.01 °BRIX. The POL measurements were obtained {{in a digital}} <b>saccharimeter</b> with a precision of 0.01. The samples of cane juice were initially cleared with lead sub-acetate (Pb(CH 3 COO) 2 ·Pb(OH) 2) and filtered before the measurements. The degree of polarization of the sample, expressed as % of juice, was calculated based on the <b>saccharimeter</b> reading (SR) using the equation POL = SR (0.2605  −  0.0009882 BRIX).|$|E
40|$|In 1900, {{measuring}} {{the purity of}} sugar {{was a problem with}} serious economic consequences, and Congress created the Bureau of Standards in part to create accurate standards for saccharimetry. To direct the Polarimetry Section, Director Stratton hired the young chemist Frederick Bates, who went on to make significant contributions to the discipline of sugar chemistry. This paper explores four of Bates’s greatest accomplishments: identifying the error caused by clarifying lead acetate, inventing the remarkable quartz-compensating <b>saccharimeter</b> with adjustable sensibility, discovering the significant error in the prevailing Ventzke saccharimetric scale, and reviving the International Commission for Uniform Methods of Sugar Analysis to unify the international community of chemists after the tensions of World War One. It also shows how accomplishments in saccharimetry reflected the growing importance and confidence of the Bureau of Standards, and how its scientific success smoothed the operation of American commerce...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} to test the suitability of near infra-red reflectance (NIR) for rapidly estimating cane quality components. A large number of mixed cane juice samples of known pol, brix, sucrose, fructose, and glucose content were used to calibrate a Technicon Model 450 Infra Alyzer. Regression analyses indicated that brix, pol, and sucrose values obtained were closely correlated with those obtained by the conventional methods of analysis based on the refractometer, <b>saccharimeter,</b> and gas chromatograph (r = 0, 90). Glucose and fructose values, however, were not well-correlated with those obtained by gas chromatography. The NIR method was also compared with the whole stalk analysis procedure used for determining pol, brix, fibre and moisture in cane, and preliminary results are reported as well as results using shredded cane samples. Indications are that a reasonably accurate estimate of cane juice quality can be rapidly achieved by this new technique...|$|E
40|$|Sugar, {{which can}} be {{extracted}} from sugar cane and sugar beet, {{is one of the}} most important ingredients of food. Conducting more research to increase the extraction efficiency of sugar is necessary due to high production of sugar beet and its numerous processing units in northern Khorasan province. In this research, the effect of temperature, time and the frequency of ultrasonic waves on mechanical properties of sugar beet and its extraction rate of sugar in moisture content of 75 % were studied. In this regard, an ultrasonic bath in laboratory scale was used. The studied parameters and their levels were frequency in three levels (zero, 25 and 45 KHz), temperature in three levels (25, 50 and 70 ° C) and the imposed time of ultrasonic waves in three levels (10, 20 and 30 min). Samples were prepared using planned experiments and the results were compared with control sugar beet samples. A <b>Saccharimeter</b> was used to measure the concenteration of sugar in samples. Two different types of probe including semi-spherical end and the other one with sharpened edges were used to measure mechanical properties. The studied parameters of frequency, temperature and time showed significant effect on sugar extraction and their resulted effect in optimized levels revealed up to 56 % increase in sugar extraction compared with control samples. The obtained values of elastic modulus and shear modulus showed a decreasing trend. The obtained values of total energy of rupture, the total energy of shear, the maximum force of rupture, and the yield point of rupture showed an increasing trend. The frequency had no significant effect on the yield point of rupture and shear force...|$|E
