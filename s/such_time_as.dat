5|$|Bill C-19 (previously Bill S-4) titled An Act {{to amend}} the Constitution Act, 1867 (Senate tenure) was a bill to limit new Senators' tenure to eight-year terms. Currently, {{senators}} can stay in office until they reach the age of 75. The bill was first introduced {{by the government in}} the Senate on May 30, 2006. After consideration in committee and making amendments to the bill, the Senate recommended that the bill not be proceeded with until <b>such</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> the Supreme Court of Canada had ruled with respect to its constitutionality, which had not occurred prior to dissolution. The bill was reintroduced in the second session as a Commons bill on November 13, 2007, but did not become law before the session ended.|$|E

5|$|In Tucson between April 2 and April 5, 1860, a {{convention}} of settlers from the southern half of the New Mexico Territory drafted a constitution for a provisional Arizona Territory, three years before the United States would create such a territory. This proposed territory consisted of the part of New Mexico Territory south of 33° 40' N. On April 2, they elected a governor, Lewis Owings. The provisional territory was to exist until <b>such</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> an official territory was created, but that proposal {{was rejected by the}} U.S. Congress at the time.|$|E
5|$|Section 3(c) {{contains}} its own preclearance {{language and}} differs from Section 5 preclearance in several ways. Unlike Section 5 preclearance, which applies to a covered jurisdiction until <b>such</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> the jurisdiction may bail out of coverage under Section 4(a), bailed-in jurisdictions remain subject to preclearance {{for as long}} as the court orders. Moreover, the court may require the jurisdiction to preclear only particular types of voting changes. For example, the bail-in of New Mexico in 1984 applied for 10 years and required preclearance of only redistricting plans. This differs from Section 5 preclearance, which requires a covered jurisdiction to preclear all of its voting changes.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, Brooke-Little was {{advanced}} {{to the position of}} Richmond Herald. On 7 July 1980, after almost thirty years of service to the Earl Marshal and the College of Arms, Brooke-Little was appointed to replace Sir Walter Verco as Norroy and Ulster King of Arms, with heraldic authority in the part of England north of the Trent, as well as in Northern Ireland. While serving in that office, he enjoyed telling people that the commonly held view that the Order of Saint Patrick was extinct was quite false. Brooke-Little believed that as the Ulster King of Arms – the capacity in which he handled Northern Irish heraldry – he remained ex officio an Officer of the Order. As the holder of that office, he and his successors would remain the Order's King of Arms, Registrar and Knight Attendant, until <b>such</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> the Sovereign should choose formally to abolish the office of Ulster King of Arms or to declare that these positions are not vested in the office. The fact that the last knight had died in 1974 was of little consequence to such a staunch traditionalist.|$|E

5|$|Las Casas's first {{proposed}} remedy {{was a complete}} moratorium {{on the use of}} Indian labor in the Indies until <b>such</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> better regulations of it were set in place. This was meant simply to halt the decimation of the Indian population and to give the surviving Indians time to reconstitute themselves. Las Casas feared that at the rate the exploitation was proceeding it would be too late to hinder their annihilation unless action were taken rapidly. The second was a change in the labor policy so that instead of a colonist owning the labor of specific Indians, he would have a right to man-hours, to be carried out by no specific persons. This required the establishment of self-governing Indian communities on the land of colonists – who would themselves organize to provide the labor for their patron. The colonist would only have rights to a certain portion of the total labor, so that a part of the Indians were always resting and taking care of the sick. He proposed 12 other remedies, all having the specific aim of improving the situation for the Indians and limiting the powers that colonists were able to exercise over them.|$|E
5|$|Section 201 amended {{legislation}} {{regarding the}} San Francisco Assay Office to allow coins to be minted there (as they previously were {{when it was}} the San Francisco Mint) until <b>such</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> the secretary certified that the mints of the United States were able to strike sufficient coins {{to meet the needs}} of the nation. It also repealed a provision of law not allowing gold or silver to be refined at the San Francisco facility. Section 202 increased the amount appropriated to expand Mint facilities (including the construction of the new Philadelphia Mint) from $30 million to $45 million. Section 9 of the Gold Standard Act of 1900 had required the Treasury Secretary to melt silver coins that were worn or no longer current, and restrike them into new ones; this was repealed by section 203 and the secretary was given authority to withdraw and melt all worn or uncurrent coins without needing to reuse the metal in coinage.|$|E
5|$|The {{positive}} {{economic outlook}} for Greece—based {{on the return}} of seasonally adjusted real GDP growth across {{the first three quarters}} of 2014—was replaced by a new fourth recession starting in Q4-2014. This new fourth recession was widely assessed as being direct related to the premature snap parliamentary election called by the Greek parliament in December 2014 and the following formation of a Syriza-led government refusing to accept respecting the terms of its current bailout agreement. The rising political uncertainty of what would follow caused the Troika to suspend all scheduled remaining aid to Greece under its current programme, until <b>such</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> the Greek government either accepted the previously negotiated conditional payment terms or alternatively could reach a mutually accepted agreement of some new updated terms with its public creditors. This rift caused a renewed increasingly growing liquidity crisis (both for the Greek government and Greek financial system), resulting in plummeting stock prices at the Athens Stock Exchange while interest rates for the Greek government at the private lending market spiked to levels once again making it inaccessible as an alternative funding source.|$|E
