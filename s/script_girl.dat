Eventually Dido married Renoir.|$|E
5|$|The {{cast and}} crew arrived in Sologne between February 6 and 15. Renoir's son Alain worked as an {{assistant}} camera operator and Dido Freire worked as the <b>script</b> <b>girl.</b> Renoir's assistants on the film were Koch, Zwobada and Henri Cartier-Bresson. Tony Corteggianni {{was hired as a}} technical advisor for the rabbit hunting sequence. The {{cast and crew}} stayed at Hotel Rat in Lamotte-Beuvron. Heavy rainfall prevented the start of shooting in Sologne for several weeks and Renoir rewrote parts of the script to accommodate the rain. While he finished the script the entire company played cards and bonded; they described it as a happy time in their lives just before the horrors of World War II began. Paulette Dubost said shooting the film was great fun.|$|E

500|$|A genetically {{enhanced}} superhuman {{who used}} {{his strength and}} intellect to briefly rule much of Earth in the 1990s. Montalbán said that he believed all good villains do villainous things, but {{think that they are}} acting for the [...] "right" [...] reasons; in this way, Khan uses his anger at the death of his wife to justify his pursuit of Kirk. The film was close to production approval when it occurred to the producers that no one had asked Montalbán whether he was interested in appearing in the film despite his character having been in the scripts for more than a year. Montalbán was unsure whether he could plausibly play Khan again after many years, especially given his current role of Mr. Roarke on Fantasy Island. Contrary to speculation that Montalbán used a prosthetic chest, no artificial devices were added to emphasize Montalbán's muscular physique, since even in his 60s and despite an increasingly painful back injury, stemming from being thrown off a horse in the 1950s, Montalbán had a vigorous workout routine. Montalbán enjoyed making the film, and counted the role as a career highlight. His major complaint was that he was never face-to-face with Shatner for a scene. [...] "I had to do my lines with the <b>script</b> <b>girl,</b> who, as you might imagine, sounded nothing like Bill ," [...] he explained.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, Lamarr was {{discovered}} {{as an actress}} and brought to Berlin by producer Max Reinhardt.

In early 1933, at age 18, she starred in Gustav Machatý's film, Ecstasy (Ekstase in German, Extase in Czech), which was filmed in Prague. Her role was that of a neglected young wife married to an indifferent older man. The film became both celebrated and notorious for showing Lamarr's face in the throes of orgasm as well as close-up and brief nude scenes, a result of her being [...] "duped" [...] by the director and producer, who used high-power telephoto lenses.|$|E
2500|$|Charlie Brown {{arrives at}} the rehearsal, but {{he is unable to}} control the {{situation}} as the uncooperative Peanuts kids are more interested in modernizing the play with dancing and lively music, mainly Schroeder's rendition of [...] "Linus and Lucy." [...] Lucy, angling to be the Christmas Queen, is also the <b>Script</b> <b>Girl,</b> handing out scripts. She and Snoopy would get into a fight after the latter mocked her. He slurps her and she, as was often the case when Snoopy kissed or licked her, ran off screaming that she had gotten dog germs, demanding hot water, disinfectant and iodine. She would also argue with Linus about his blanket and demands that he give it up. He uses it as a costume, which infuriates Lucy yet again.|$|E

5000|$|... "It {{was one of}} {{the best}} <b>scripts</b> for a <b>girl</b> that I'd seen around that {{particular}} time," [...] said Gail Davis. [...] "A lot of times in Westerns they gave the girl the part where she sits at the ranch house waiting for the cowboy to come home, or she waves to the cowboy at the end of the picture as he rides off into the sunset." ...|$|R

50|$|Tazuko Sakane was {{introduced}} to Kenji Mizoguchi by her father. Impressed by Sakane's sensible character, Mizoguchi hired her as a <b>script</b> <b>girl.</b> Under Mizoguchi's patronage, Sakane became Japan's first and only female film director in the prewar period. Although she is not given credit, she entered into a collaboration with Mizoguchi on the film The Foreigner's Mistress(1930). After that, she continued to work with Mizoguchi on multiple projects such as Yet They Go (1931) and The Man of the Moment (1932) as a screenwriter and an assistant director, although only receiving credit for her position as an assistant director.

5000|$|In 1975 Tony Perkins {{said he and}} Sondheim {{were working}} on another <b>script,</b> The Chorus <b>Girl</b> Murder Case.

50|$|Writers Andrew Fleming and Sheryl Longin {{attempted}} to write several different <b>scripts</b> with teenage <b>girls</b> as protagonists. The {{idea of using}} the Watergate scandal came from a real-life experience Longin had with Nixon when her family stayed at the same hotel as Nixon. As a child, she and a friend pelted Nixon with ice cubes, causing a minor disturbance. Fleming {{said that he was}} surprised at the attempts to rehabilitate Nixon's image, and Longin cited the Watergate scandal as a defining political moment for their generation. She said she channeled the resulting anger and cynicism into the script. Several people told the duo that various gags went too far. Fleming, who believed Nixon got off easily, said they fought to keep everything. They approached Ben Bradlee and John Dean to play themselves, but both declined.|$|R

5000|$|In Bad Girls, {{she played}} prison inmate Snowball Merriman in series 4 and 5; {{she played a}} {{different}} character, Shell Dockley, in the West End stage musical version at London's Garrick Theatre. This role was played (as a non-musical part) in series 1, 2, 3 and 5 of the TV series by Debra Stephenson. Faraday and Stephenson bear a strong physical resemblance and their characters in Bad Girls were similarly styled. The <b>script</b> for Bad <b>Girls</b> acknowledged this; when the character of Shell returned to the TV series for several episodes in series 5 (after being recaptured having escaped from prison and spending some time on the run in Europe), Shell offers up a comment on Snowball: [...] "Cheeky slag!

50|$|Mills {{started his}} career as a sub-editor for D. C. Thomson & Co. Ltd, where he met Wagner. In 1971 both left to go freelance, and were soon writing <b>scripts</b> for IPCs <b>girls</b> and humour comics. After D.C. Thomson {{launched}} Warlord, a successful war-themed weekly, Mills was asked in 1975 to develop a rival title for IPC. Based in the girls comics department to avoid the attention of the staff of the boys department, Mills, along with Wagner and Gerry Finley-Day, worked in secret to create Battle Picture Weekly. Battles stories were more violent and its characters more working class than IPCs traditional fare, and it was an immediate hit. Having made the comic ready for launch, Mills resigned as editor. He would later write the celebrated First World War series Charleys War, drawn by Joe Colquhoun, for the title.|$|R
