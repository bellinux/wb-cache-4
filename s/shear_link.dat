The specimen {{is to examine the}} behavior of <b>shear</b> <b>link</b> by using diagonal stiffener on web part under static monotonic and cyclic load. The cyclic loading pattern conducted in the experiment is adjusted according to AISC loading standards 2005. Analysis was carried out using non-linear finite element method using MSC/NASTRAN software. Link was modeled as CQUAD shell element. Along the boundary of the loading area the nodal are constraint to produce only one direction loading. The length of the link in this analysis is 400 mm of the steel profile of WF 200. 100. Important parameters considered to effect significantly to the performance of <b>shear</b> <b>link</b> have been analyzed, namely flange and web thicknesses,, thickness and length of web stiffener, thickness of diagonal stiffener and geometric of diagonal stiffener. The behavior of <b>shear</b> <b>link</b> with diagonal web stiffener was compared with the behavior of standard link designed based on AISC 2005 criteria. Analysis results show that diagonal web stiffener is capable to increase <b>shear</b> <b>link</b> performance in terms of stiffness, strength and energy dissipation in supporting lateral load. However, differences in displacement ductility’s between shear links with diagonal stiffener and shear links based on AISC standards have not shown to be significant. Analysis results also show thickness of diagonal stiffener and geometric model of stiffener to have a significant influence on the performance of shear links. To perform validation of the numerical study, the research is followed by experimental work conducted in Structural Mechanic Laboratory Center for Industrial Engineering ITB. The Structures and Mechanics Lab rotary PAU-ITB. The experiments were carried out using three test specimens with model and dimension identical to the model in the numerical study. Experimental testing apparently has shown results of the same behavior as predicted in the numerical study. However, when it is compared to the shape of the hysterical curve, a slight difference is apparent. This is due to the influence of stiffness of bolt joints and the supports which is difficult to model precisely in the numerical studies...|$|E

The remarkable hysteresis behavior of <b>shear</b> <b>links</b> in EBFs is so appealing to seismic design that they have also been used in other types of structure applications such as fuse members that provides required ductility and energy dissipation. Therefore, using <b>shear</b> <b>links</b> {{is becoming more and}} more popular not only in buildings but also in bridges. In order to assure that <b>shear</b> <b>links</b> provide required strength and ductility of the structure, studying the effect of key parameters on hysteretic behavior of <b>shear</b> <b>links</b> is of interest. High axial load is one of the key parameters which affect hysteretic behavior of <b>shear</b> <b>links</b> because premature flange local buckling might occur and results in deterioration in shear capacity, ductility, and energy dissipation of the links.

40|$|Eccentrically braced frames (EBF) {{represent}} an optimal structural solution for ductile buildings in seismic prone areas, characterized by high dissipative capacity, ability to withstand strong seismic events and good elastic stiffness, needed {{to avoid the}} damage of non-structural elements during low-to-moderate seismic events. The knowledge of the cyclic behaviour of the dissipative link elements is required to perform accurate nonlinear analyses: notwithstanding such aspects, {{there is a lack}} of modelling techniques of EBFs equipped with short links, which dissipate energy in shear, while usually simple bilinear springs with kinematic hardening constitutive laws are used, leading to not completely reliable results. In the main framework of the European Project “MATCH: Material choice for seismic resistant structures” (2013 - 2016), promoted by the RFCS (Research Fund for Coal and Steel) real scale experimental tests of frames equipped with vertical and horizontal <b>shear</b> <b>links,</b> have been performed, in order to precisely define the behaviour of dissipative <b>shear</b> <b>links</b> and to calibrate a semi-analytical model able to catch the cyclic behaviour of the <b>shear</b> <b>links.</b> The semi-analytical model has been then used to assess the influence of the correct modeling of <b>shear</b> <b>links</b> on the collapse behaviour of EBF seismic structures and to evaluate the influence of the ultimate plastic rotation on collapse. To this aim, two multistory buildings, equipped respectively with vertical and horizontal dissipative <b>shear</b> <b>links</b> have been firstly designed according to the actual European Standards (EN 1998 - 1 : 2005 2005) optimizing their global dissipative behaviour until the collapse and then analyzed through Incremental Dynamic Analyses (IDA) modeling the <b>shear</b> <b>links</b> both with a classical approach and with the proposed semi-analytical model...|$|R

40|$|Eccentrically Braced Frames (EBFs) {{have been}} widely used in seismic {{protection}} and remediation in the recent years. However, the seismic behavior of shear links made of high strength steel, which are essential "fuse" elements in EBFs, are not fully understood yet. Furthermore, most existing studies either assumed no axial load or an unrealistic constant axial load. In this numerical simulation study, two steel grades (Q 460 high strength structural steel (by China standard) and ASTM A 992 steel for comparison) were considered for the <b>shear</b> <b>link</b> specimens and their effects on shear link's seismic performance were numerically studied under cyclically varying lateral load along with axial force. Finite element (FE) modeling of <b>shear</b> <b>link</b> specimens with the above two steel grades were established in a general FE analysis software - ANSYS and numerical simulations are conducted on these finite element models following monotonic and cyclic loading protocols respectively. To see whether a sustainability goal of steel structure design (by saving steel use) can be achieved or not, a feasibility study of Q 460 steel shear links with various section size reduction schemes are performed in this research. The numerical simulation results reveal that shear links made of Q 460 high strength steel have satisfactory performance compared with A 992 steel shear links, with additional benefits of material saving and weight reduction, often desired features for sustainable steel construction and replaceable fuse elements in seismic resistant structures...|$|E
40|$|The {{structural}} behaviour {{of steel}} fibre-reinforced concrete (SFRC) {{has been studied}} using non-linear finite element analysis (NLFEA) and ABAQUS software. An interesting feature of this work is the consideration of statically indeterminate SFRC columns. Most of the SFRC specimens studied in the literature are simply supported beams, and information on statically indeterminate columns is sparse. In addition, both axial and lateral loads were considered {{in order to allow}} for compression and flexural effects on the columns. The aim of the work was to examine the potential for using steel fibres {{to reduce the amount of}} conventional transverse steel reinforcement without compromising ductility and strength requirements. To achieve this, the spacing between <b>shear</b> <b>links</b> was increased while steel fibres were added as a substitute (spacing between <b>shear</b> <b>links</b> increased by 50 and 100 % with fibre volume fraction Vf increased to Vf = 1, 1. 5, 2 and 2. 5 %). The numerical model was carefully calibrated against existing experimental data to ensure the reliability of its predictions. Parametric studies were subsequently carried out, which provided insight into how the steel fibres can help reduce the number of conventional <b>shear</b> <b>links...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Shear</b> <b>links</b> {{are used}} as fuse {{elements}} in lateral load resisting systems to provide ductility and dissipate seismic energy. These links have traditionally been employed in eccentrically braced frames, but have more recently been suggested {{for use in the}} innovative linked column frame system (LCF). Current design specifications for <b>shear</b> <b>links</b> require intermediate web stiffeners to provide out-of-plane web stability so ductility requirements can be achieved. This research focused on moving from discrete transverse web stiffening to continuously stiffened webs in built up <b>shear</b> <b>links.</b> Built up links were designed to yield in shear when subjected to severe cyclic loading, however the webs of the links were designed using two metal sheets joined by an elastic core. These composite 2 ̆ 2 sandwich 2 ̆ 2 webs allowed for an increase in web thickness (and inherent flexural rigidity) without increasing the shear strength of the links. Numerical and experimental investigations were conducted to assess the performance of composite sandwich links subjected to severe loading. Numerical results showed improved web behavior in sandwich links in which the core material was assigned an elastic modulus greater than 5000 psi. Due to fabrication limitations, experimental specimens were fabricated with a core material elastic modulus of 1000 psi. These specimens did not perform as well as unstiffened base case links in terms global hysteretic behavior or ductility...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} work aims to investigate numerically the behaviour of steel fibre reinforced concrete beamâcolumn joints under seismic action. Both {{exterior and interior}} joint types were examined and 3 D nonlinear finite element analyses were carried out using ABAQUS software. The joints were subjected to reversed-cyclic loading, combined with a constant axial force on the column representing gravity loads. The joints were initially calibrated using existing experimental data â to ascertain {{the validity of the}} numerical model used â and then parametric studies were carried out using different steel fibre ratios coupled with increased spacing of <b>shear</b> <b>links.</b> The aim was to assess the effect of introducing steel fibres into the concrete mix in order to compensate for a reduced amount of conventional transverse steel reinforcement and hence lessen congestion of the latter. This is particularly useful for joints designed to withstand seismic loading as code requirements (e. g. Eurocode 8) lead to a high amount of <b>shear</b> <b>links</b> provided to protect critical regions. The spacing between <b>shear</b> <b>links</b> was increased by 0 %, 50 % and 100 %, whilst the fibre volume fraction (Vf) was increased by 0 %, 1 %, 1. 5 %, 2 % and 2. 5 %. Potential enhancement to ductility, a key requirement in seismic design, was investigated as well as potential improvements to energy absorption and confinement. The work also examined key structural issues such as strength, storey drift, plastic hinges formation and cracking patterns...|$|R

40|$|AbstractExternally bonded {{steel plate}} {{is widely used}} to {{strengthen}} the deficient flexural strength of reinforced concrete beams. The flexural strength retrofitted by this method {{is limited to a}} certain value as the balanced compression region of concrete is restricted. For an engineering project of retrofitting, this method can not be used and other methods are not convenient to apply. In this condition, externally bonded small sized H-type steel member may be used to get larger resistance of bending moment as the arm of the tension force is also extended. The JGN structural adhesive is used for bonding and the new type of steel-concrete composite beam is formed. Some related problems of the design and analysis for this retrofitted beam are presented. Similar to the design analysis of reinforced concrete beam, the hypothesis for the rigid-plastic equilibrium of the forces across the section is adopted for the analysis of the flexural strength of the retrofitted beam. The flexural stiffness can be got by the design code. The primary purpose for retrofitting the beam is reached. Shear stress of the retrofitted beam is analyzed by the method of material mechanics for shear strength check. According to the design code, the JGN structural adhesive can meet the strength demand to guarantee the full <b>shear</b> <b>link</b> on the interface. Furthermore, anchor bolts are set additionally as the strength margin for connection. Finally, the influence of slip in the retrofitted beam is discussed. The slip and the additional deflection of the composite beam can be obtained by the theoretical formulae in the literature. The negligible influence of slip between the H-type steel member and the original reinforced concrete part is found. Comparative analysis by finite element method is also done for the verification of the slip and the deflection for this project. The full <b>shear</b> <b>link</b> on the interface of the beam is proved...|$|E

Understanding the complex behavior of this joint method under repeated load is crucial {{because of their}} basic materials have limited strengths that can cause the limited force carrying capacity. This study was focus {{on the performance of}} beam column joint subjected to repeated reversed load. Three specimens of {{reinforced concrete}} (RC) exterior beam-column joint with different steel detail arrangement had been prepared and tested under repeated reversed load. All beam-column joint specimens were designed in accordance to BS 8110 and the types of joint were exterior joint. First specimen was the control specimen where no additional <b>shear</b> <b>link</b> on beam reinforcement and no anchorages of bars were tied between beam and column. Second speciment consist of additional <b>shear</b> <b>link</b> on beam reinforcement with 75 mm spacing which is closer then specimen 1 and 3. Third specimen introduced cross-bracing of reinforcement bars at the intersection of beam-column joint. In this study, failure load, beam displacement, stiffness, strain value of steel reinforcement, mode of failure had been presented. The repeated reversed loads were applied to the end of cantilever beam. The dimension for each column was 300 x 300 x 1500 mm, and the cantilever beam with dimension, 300 x 150 x 1000 rnm was located at the mid-height of column. High-yield steel was utilized for all main reinforcement with 8 T 16 bars for column rebar and 4 T 16 for cantilever RC beam. Mild steel type was used for all steel links. In addition, 30 grade of concrete was employed and the concrete design was based on JKR mix design method.

40|$|The {{present study}} is aimed at {{examining}} the structural response of steel-fibre-reinforced concrete (SFRC) columns under reversed-cyclic loading, which were investigated by means of non-linear finite-element analysis (NLFEA). The focus was on investigating the potential of steel fibres in compensating for reduction in conventional transverse reinforcement [and thus the spacing between <b>shear</b> <b>links</b> was increased by 50 % and 100 % while the fibre volume fraction (Vf) was increased to 1 %, 1. 5 %, 2 % and 2. 5 %]. This is useful in situations where the latter is required in significant amounts (e. g. in seismic design) leading to congestion and practical difficulties in placing the links. The critical factor in the seismic response is the cyclic nature of the load, which is examined in the present research work. An interesting feature of the present research work is the consideration of statically-indeterminate SFRC columns, information on which is rare as previous research {{studies have focused on}} simply-supported beams. To address this, both indeterminacy and axial loads were considered in the present investigation. Calibration work was carried out using existing experimental data and good correlation was established between numerical and test results.

40|$|The winding of Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) tows around {{longitudinal}} {{reinforcing bars}} provides a novel method for the fabrication of reinforcement cages. Complex geometries of internal reinforcement can be fabricated using this technique, a particular {{advantage for the}} construction of optimised concrete beams. A key limitation on the contribution of FRP to the shear capacity of a concrete member is found at corners, where the presence of stress concentrations in different directions can lead to premature failure. A new test methodology was developed to allow for rapid testing of the samples as well as sample realignment during load application, reducing the effects of eccentricities and imperfections created during their fabrication. An experimental program, comprising 30 test samples, was undertaken to assess the bend capacity of filament wound FRP (W-FRP) <b>shear</b> <b>links</b> manufactured using a carbon tow impregnated with epoxy resin. A fixed bend radius of 5 mm and six non-circular fibre cross sectional areas having different width-thickness ratios were considered. Additionally, 18 samples were tested to measure the tensile properties of the straight reinforcement. The test results indicate that W-FRP <b>shear</b> <b>links</b> exhibit improved bend strength as compared to conventional stirrups with circular sections (up to + 53 %), as a larger width-thickness ratio of the reinforcement provided more strength for a given cross sectional area.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} <b>shear</b> <b>link</b> overstrength, which {{is defined as the}} ratio between the peak inelastic and the yield strength. Three basic parameters are devised as generally influencing shear overstrength: (i) axial forces acting on the link, (ii) the ratio of link flange over web area and (iii) the ratio between link length and cross section depth. The study presented does not consider the case of axial forces directly applied to the link, but the tensile axial forces developing as a consequence of axial restraints are taken into account. Numerical analysis of finite element (FE) models has been carried out in order to ascertain the combined influence of these factors on the plastic overstrength. A simple analytical model is proposed on the basis of FE model analysis results. The analytical predictions are compared with results of available experimental test results, showing satisfactory agreement...|$|E

The link was subjected to 0. 15 radians of rotation in the final cycle, which is almost twice the maximum rotation allowed in building codes for links with I-shaped cross-sections. Although the final failure mode was fracture of the bottom link flange, the large rotations achieved were well above what would be required in a seismic event, indicating that hybrid rectangular links without lateral bracing of the link can indeed be a viable alternative for applications in steel bridge piers in seismic regions...|$|E

Working in a way similar to coupled shear walls, the proposed element behavior is theoretically analyzed in linear and non-linear range. In fact, considering different restrained cases, a parametric analysis is developed in order both to evaluate the effect of the main geometrical and structural parameters and to provide the design capacity curves of this new damper. The DC can be considered as a new damping device easy to be installed to new as well to the existing buildings in order to protect them from seismic damage...|$|R
40|$|Non-linear {{finite element}} models {{accounting}} for large displacements {{have been used to}} investigate the behavior of steel built-up shear links that had previously been tested using large-scale experiments. The links were designed using steel grades with yield points ranging from high to low strengths. The objectives of the numerical analyses were to further investigate the non-linear behavior and to correlate the numerical results with experimental observations. Elasto-plastic as well as cyclic stress-strain material properties were incorporated to study the influence of material behavior on the overall <b>shear</b> <b>link</b> response. Non-linear monotonic analyses of the shear links incorporating the cyclic stress-strain steel properties resulted in similar trends in the response as the backbone curves recorded from the physical experiments. The numerical models of built-up shear links utilizing structural grade steels closely correlated to the experimentally recorded shear strength. Models utilizing low yield point steels overestimated the shear strength, which was caused by the characteristics of cyclic behavior of those steels. The detailed numerical models also allowed for investigation of the plastic strain demands on the different components of the link. Plastic strain concentrations were evident in the web of shear links at stiffener to web interface. These location...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The loss of {{occupancy}} and {{the difficulty}} associated with repairing a conventional structure following an earthquake can economically burden owners as well as occupants. This paper outlines a concept of a linked column steel framing system utilizing replaceable components that are strategically placed to protect the gravity load carrying system. The nonbraced lateral system relies on the inelastic behaviour of bolted shear links. Non-linear pushover analyses were used to investigate {{the performance of a}} three-story building and demonstrated ductile behaviour with the potential for rapid return to occupancy. Practical connection details for the link components were proposed in an effort to provide elastic connections that shift plastic strains away from critical welds, thereby avoiding some of the failures observed in past tests on similarly detailed link-to-column eccentrically braced frames. Link end details were investigated using detailed non-linear finite element analyses and showed the viability of the <b>shear</b> <b>link</b> component to provide inelastic energy dissipation while limiting plastic strains at the bolted connection. In general, the linked column framing system is thought to be viable under seismic loading, offering a ductile structural system with the ability to rapidly return to occupancy. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} was to deal with overall behaviour of reinforced concrete deep beams with openings strengthened and un-strengthened by carbon fiber reinforced polymer at the shear span near support. The major objectives of the research are to determine the load-deflection curve, crack pattern and effects of opening shape for each beam with and without CFRP strengthening as well as identifying the most effective strengthening method. Due to limited research in numerical approach, this {{research was}} conducted by validating the finite element modelling results with experimental results. A total of eleven (11) beams with dimension of 120 x 600 x 2400 mm were modelled as simply supported beams in three-dimensional (31)) analysis by using finite element program, Ansys 12. 0. In the research, two (2) types of opening shapes, rectangular (270 x 600 mm) and circularised rectangular (270 x 330 mm, 0 270 mm) openings were placed at the mid shear span of the beams. In addition, reinforcement used was 2 T 16 for bottom bar, 2 T 10 for top bar, R 6 - 300 c/c for <b>shear</b> <b>link</b> and R 6 - 150 c/c for riser bar. Based on the analytical results, all the beams were failed in shear mode with cracking diagonally from the support to the sharp edge of the rectangular opening and around the circular edge of circularised rectangular opening. By comparing with solid beam, rectangular and circularised rectangular openings have resulted into {{a reduction in the}} beam bearing capacity by 70. 6...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a {{brief review of}} recent work on the development of solutions for the seismic design and retrofit of steel structures by various members of the U.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of an {{experimental}} investigation into the structural behaviour of reinforced concrete beams incorporating a novel EPS-based lightweight aggregate (LWA) called stabilised polystyrene (SPS) aggregate. Four concrete mixtures with water to cement (W/C) ratio of 0. 8 were used. The replacement levels of natural aggregate by SPS were 0 %, 30 %, 60 % and 100 %. The volume ratio to manufacture SPS aggregate was 8 : 1 : 1 (80 % waste EPS: 10 % cement: 10 % clay). A total of 24 beams were cast and tested at 28 -day age. Three types of tension reinforcement were used: 2 bars, 3 bars and 2 bars + <b>shear</b> <b>links.</b> There were no compression bars at the top for all beams. Four point-loading flexural tests were conducted up to failure. In general, it can be observed that the structural behaviour of SPS concrete beams {{is similar to that of}} other types of lightweight aggregate concretes used around the world...|$|R
40|$|Seismic {{evaluations}} of many existing deck-truss bridges have revealed {{the vulnerability of}} their substructure and members of their superstructure. An innovative retrofit strategy developed by the authors includes replacement of the existing non-ductile end and lower-end bracing with ductile panels by incorporating energy dissipating devices to act as fuses, which can yield and dissipate energy while protecting both superstructure and substructure. A 27 -ft long deck-truss bridge model was designed and constructed at the University of Ottawa, and was pseudo-dynamically tested in its as-built as well as retrofitted conditions. Two configurations of Eccentrically Braced Frames, EBF, and Vertical <b>Shear</b> <b>Links,</b> VSL, were used as ductile retrofits, and both performed well. The ductile retrofit devices exhibited a robust hysteretic behavior, dissipated the seismic induced energy and prevented damage in other structural members of the model bridge when it was subjected to scaled El Centro earthquake. This paper describes the retrofit concept, the innovative seismic testing procedure, {{and the performance of}} the steel ductile retrofits...|$|R
