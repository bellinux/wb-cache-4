40|$|Small {{ruminants}} {{have received}} very little attention {{in research and}} development as they are usually owned by smallholders and pastoralists with little influence and buying power. Moreover, they are often produced for subsistence purposes, their products are rarely marketed, and they are often cared for by women and children.

The paper presents a case study of small stock production in Mukogodo Division, Laikipia District, based on 14 months of fieldwork in the area in 1987 / 8, Mukogodo producers are poor in comparison with other pastoralists and the proportion of small stock in their flocks is high.

40|$|Aim of the paper: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine human {{resources}} management practices (HRM practices) in small firms and to improve the understanding of the relationship between this kind of practices and business growth. This exploratory study is based on the resource-based view of the firm and empirical work carried out in two small firms by relating HRM practices with the firms’ results. Contribution to the literature: This is an in-depth study of HRM practices and its impact on performance growth in micro firms, isolating and controlling for most of the contextual and internal variables considered in the literature that relate HRM to growth. Firm growth analysis was broadened by the use of several dependent variables: employment growth and operational and financial performance growth. Some hypotheses for further research in identifying HRM practices in small business and its relation with firm growth are suggested. Methodology: Case study methodology was used to study two firms. The techniques used to collect data were semi-structured interviews to the owner and all the employees, unstructured observation at the firms’ facilities (during two days), entrepreneur profile definition (survey answer) and document data collection (on demographic characterization and performance results). Data was analyzed through content analysis methodology, and categories derived from the interviews’ protocols and literature. Results and implications: Results revealed that despite the firms’ organizational characteristics similarities, they differ significantly in owners’ motivation to grow, HRM practices and organizational performance and growth. Future studies should pay <b>special</b> attention to <b>owner</b> willingness to grow, to firms’ years of experience in business, to staff’s years of experience in their field of work and turnover. HRM practices in micro/small firms should be better defined and characterized. The external image of management posture relating to longitudinal financial results and growth should also be explored...|$|R
40|$|Ownership of {{agricultural}} property gives its <b>owners</b> <b>special</b> powers, but also imposes on them {{a number of}} restrictions arising from law. These restrictions apply to both how to acquire and sell such property. They provide additional protection {{of agricultural}} land and have a relationship {{not only with the}} EU subsidies for agricultural production but also the need for deliberate planning for the countryside. First it should be noted the right of pre-emption of the real estate by the Agricultural Property Agency and the ability to block or cancel the sale if the seller and buyer do not comply with the required formalities. In most cases, the Agency is the seller, so it means that it can shape the rate of sales prices. On the other hand, as a unit under the Treasury it is obliged to comply with the law on public procurement and to protect the public interest. Legal issues related to the management shall be governed by national rules, adapted to the European directives and treaties. Another issue is the agricultural property divisions, which are held in a simplified form, however, maintain the minimum area of land resulting from the surveying division. Such restrictions are to prevent excessive fragmentation of agricultural land. If the existing patchwork of land was made from too small plots, there is a possibility to make integration and exchange of land. It has the nature of the collective spatial effort, which effect will improve the area structure of agricultural holdings and shall be created more favorable conditions for the management of agriculture. Important are also the possibilities of development the agricultural land. It can be done, only if the creation of a farm building will be used for agricultural production. Vital issue, maintained in this article, is also the issue of the exclusion of land from agricultural production in order to use them for non-agricultural holdings. Edward Prewed...|$|R
40|$|Residential {{real estate}} has {{achieved}} an exalted status and privileged position in American property law. The {{notion of the}} home as a special object deserving heightened protection is widely accepted within the case law and scholarship. Influential scholars, most notably Margaret Radin, {{have argued that the}} home is critical for an individual 2 ̆ 7 s very identity and ability to flourish in society. Other commentators have expounded a communitarian vision of the home as rooting individuals in communities of close-knit social ties. Over the past century, there has been a proliferation of legislation creating <b>special</b> protections for <b>owners</b> of residential real estate such as homestead exemptions, tenancy by the entirety, property tax relief, and more recently foreclosure relief and state eminent domain legislation shielding residential real estate. This typeof legislation imposes a variety of social costs including raising the cost of credit, skewing housing prices and incentivizing over-investment, and forcing less affluent homeowners to subsidize more affluent homeowners through regressive measures. One motivation for residential protection legislation is the desire to protect the special values attributed to the home, especially for families. More often, the impetus for such legislation is rent-seeking by special interest groups, competition between states to attract residents, actions by local home voters who attempt to externalize costs across localities, or grandstanding by politicians anxious to capitalize on the evocative chord of home protection. The belief that homes play a critical and irreplaceable role in the lives of individuals and families has provided a gloss of moral legitimacy to rent-seeking and greased the wheels of the residential protectionism machine. It is time for a critical reexamination of the importance attributed to the home. Drawing on the research literature in psychology, sociology, and demographics this paper argues that there is scant evidence to support a categorical theory of the home as a special object that constitutes individual identity or enables a rich web of social interactions. The psychology research illustrates the importance of social interaction and relationships (not possessions) for human functioning while the demographic research indicates that closely-knit, low-turnover, territorial neighborhoods are the exception, not the norm...|$|R
