60|$|There was a {{pause and}} I saw the <b>slackening</b> <b>of</b> her reins. No doubt, had we been afoot she would have halted, the better to confront me.|$|R
60|$|After {{a minute}} or two, when nothing was heard but the rattle of water upon the glass, there was a {{perceptible}} <b>slackening</b> <b>of</b> the sound, and then the atmosphere became lighter.|$|R
50|$|Drowned In Sound said 'All Kneel sounds {{anything}} but a <b>slackening</b> <b>of</b> the pace. Guitars roar menacingly through the speakers, Kat vocals plead and scream and bellow in all the correct measures...'.|$|R
60|$|Thus {{in these}} brief weeks Dorothea's joyous {{grateful}} expectation was unbroken, and however her lover might occasionally {{be conscious of}} flatness, he could never refer it to any <b>slackening</b> <b>of</b> her affectionate interest.|$|R
60|$|Now, they turned, and we rushed! Great pressure, and {{a scream}} {{or two from}} the front. Then a laugh or two, some {{expressions}} of disappointment, and a <b>slackening</b> <b>of</b> the pressure and subsidence of the struggle.--Old man not there.|$|R
40|$|Brussels: the <b>slackening</b> <b>of</b> {{counter-urbanization}} The {{process of}} urbanization - suburbanization has been {{followed in the}} Brussels area during the seventies by a very intensive counter-urbanization. The migration flow is positive in the rural districts for the 25 - 40 years old households with their children under 10 years. Around 20 years, on the contrary, migration to town is more important, {{as it is for}} unmarried people. Since 1979 a <b>slackening</b> <b>of</b> the urban to rural shift is observed, and seems to be linked with the economic crisis. Laconte Pierre, Poulain Michel.

60|$|Anna toyed for {{a moment}} with the rose at her bosom. Her eyes were looking out of the room. Once again she was {{conscious}} <b>of</b> a curious <b>slackening</b> <b>of</b> purpose, a confusion of issues which had once seemed to her so clear.|$|R
5000|$|After <b>slackening</b> <b>of</b> Ottoman {{pressure}} on Croatian {{lands in the}} 17th century, the fortress changed its owners {{for a couple of}} times, being sometimes damaged, but immediately repaired. The last major damage occurred during the Second World War, as the fortification was hit by shells and the northwest tower was partially destroyed.|$|R
60|$|There,--you hear it?--the long whistle of the locomotive, one, two, three! You {{feel the}} sharp <b>slackening</b> <b>of</b> the train as it swings round {{the curve of}} the last {{embankment}} that brings it to the Mariposa station. See, too, as we round the curve, the row of the flashing lights, the bright windows of the depot.|$|R

[...] "Let there be no <b>slackening</b> <b>of</b> vigilance this night. No one to go {{in or out of}} that house, no one to approach it under any circumstances whatever. Is that understood?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "More by token," [...] said he, [...] "that {{the house}} of this Master Caxton as you call him seems to me no canny haunt. Tell me what you will of making {{manifold}} good books or bad, I'll never believe but that Dr. Faustus and the Devil hatched the notion between them for the bewilderment of men's brains and the <b>slackening</b> <b>of</b> their hands." ...|$|R
50|$|Between 1864 and 1874, Bjørnson {{displayed}} a <b>slackening</b> <b>of</b> the intellectual forces very remarkable {{in a man}} of his energy; he was mainly occupied with politics and with his business as a theatrical manager. This was the period of Bjørnson's most fiery propaganda as a radical agitator. In 1871 he began to supplement his journalistic work by delivering lectures throughout Scandinavia.|$|R
5000|$|Varietys David Rooney {{gave the}} film a mixed review, praising the film's [...] "exhilarating" [...] opening {{sequence}} and Giuseppe Rotunno's [...] "cool and elegant" [...] cinematography, but lamented that [...] "as {{with much of}} the director’s work, large sections of plot are pure hokum, and the gradual <b>slackening</b> <b>of</b> both pace and suspense in a sluggish second half only underlines the increasing silliness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “There is none,” {{said the}} doctor quietly. “A general <b>slackening</b> <b>of</b> tension will help. You must take life easier, shorten your working hours, avoid {{excitement}} and mental concentration, and take a holiday when you can. I recommend a three months’ change with complete rest, but {{there will always be}} some risk of a seizure. Your aim must be to make it as small a risk as possible.” ...|$|R
50|$|In return, Cutolo {{allegedly}} {{asked for}} a <b>slackening</b> <b>of</b> police operations against the Camorra, for control over the tendering of building contracts in Campania (a lucrative venture since the devastating earthquake in November 1980) and for a reduction of his own sentence - {{as well as new}} psychiatric test to show that he is not responsible for his actions. Both these last concessions were granted.|$|R
5000|$|Decentralization: As power becomes decentralized, {{people tend}} to be more self-regimented and have many more {{personal}} freedoms. In many instances of collapse, there is a <b>slackening</b> <b>of</b> social rules and etiquette. Geographically speaking, communities become more parochial or isolated. For example, following the collapse of the Maya civilization, many Maya returned to their traditional hamlets, moving away from the large cities that had dominated the political landscape.|$|R
50|$|The {{school was}} closed in 1959, when declining {{enrollment}} {{due to a}} <b>slackening</b> <b>of</b> mining activity led students to be bused to Rock Springs, 7 mi away. It {{was used by the}} Western Wyoming Community College from 1959 to 1969, when the college relocated to a new campus. A renewed mining boom, this time for coal and trona led to the reopening of the school in 1973.|$|R
2500|$|However, in {{this speech}} he also {{rejected}} the idea he was a conservative, saying he was a realist. Ligachyov also stated earlier that [...] "the <b>slackening</b> <b>of</b> state discipline" [...] was [...] "among {{the reasons for the}} troubled state of the economy". Furthermore, together with KGB head Viktor Chebrikov, Ligachyov took several opportunities before he was demoted to Secretary for Agriculture in 1988 to warn against rapid reform.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a sudden}} <b>slackening</b> <b>of</b> speed. The brakes were on and the whistle sounding. Reist strolled to the {{platform}} of the car as though to look out, and Ughtred followed him. A conductor unfastened the gate and slipped away. The train {{had come to a}} standstill in a tiny station, a little wooden building with a cupola, and everywhere surrounded with a dense forest of pines. Reist looked swiftly round.|$|R
50|$|In {{return for}} {{negotiating}} {{the release of}} Cirillo, Cutolo allegedly asked for a <b>slackening</b> <b>of</b> police operations against the Camorra, for control over the tendering of building contracts in Campania (a lucrative venture since the devastating earthquake in November 1980) and for a reduction of his own sentence - {{as well as new}} psychiatric test to show that he is not responsible for his actions.

5000|$|The {{earth and}} the water form one globe, {{surrounded}} on all sides by air. Then, since much of the air is {{in contact with the}} sphere of the moon, it becomes heated in consequence of the movement and friction of the parts in contact. Thus there is produced fire, which surrounds the air, less in amount in the proximity of the poles owing to the <b>slackening</b> <b>of</b> the movement there.|$|R
5|$|A <b>slackening</b> <b>of</b> social customs {{occurred}} on all social levels; extramarital relationships and illegitimate children were common. Because poverty {{was on the}} rise—especially in the lower classes—many women were forced to find lodgings quickly, for example in convents, o. This explained the abundance of the clergy in a small city like Quito; often men were ordained not because of a vocation but because it solved their economic problems and improved their community standing.|$|R
60|$|For {{nothing short}} of the miraculous could snatch this game from him now. Burns had {{withstood}} a severe pounding, but he would last out the inning, and Wayne did {{not take into account}} the rest of the team. He opened up with no <b>slackening</b> <b>of</b> his terrific speed, and he struck out the three remaining batters on eleven pitched balls. Then in the rising din he ran for Burns and gave him a mighty hug.|$|R

60|$|A gasp and a groan and {{an abrupt}} <b>slackening</b> <b>of</b> the rope, warned him. He began to slip. The {{movement}} was very slow. The rope tightened loyally, {{but he continued}} to slip. Carson could not hold him, and was slipping with him. The digging toe of his farther-extended foot encountered vacancy, {{and he knew that}} it was over the straight-away fall. And he knew, too, that in another moment his falling body would jerk Carson's after it.|$|R
60|$|Fischer {{threw himself}} into the client's easy-chair. The {{furniture}} in the office seemed less distinct than usual. He was conscious of a certain haziness of outline in everything. Van Teyl's face, even, was shrouded in a little mist. Then he suddenly found himself fighting fiercely, fighting for his consciousness, fighting against a wave of giddiness, a deadly sinking of the heart, a strange <b>slackening</b> <b>of</b> all his nerve power. The young stockbroker rose hastily to his feet.|$|R

50|$|Wilsons and Clyde Coal Company v English (1937) give due {{regard to}} the actual {{conditions}} under which men work in a factory or mine, at the long hours and the fatigue, to the <b>slackening</b> <b>of</b> attention which naturally comes from constant repetition of the same operation, to the noise and confusion in which the man works, to his preoccupation in what he is actually doing at the cost perhaps of some inattention to his own safety.|$|R
40|$|The British Isles {{benefits}} from dense meteorological observation networks, enabling {{insights into the}} still-unresolved effects of solar eclipse events on the near-surface wind field. The near-surface effects of the solar eclipse of 20 March 2015 are derived through comparison of output from the Met Office's operational weather forecast model (which is ignorant of the eclipse) with data from two meteorological networks: the Met Office's land surface station (MIDAS) network and a roadside measurement network operated by Vaisala. Synoptic-evolution relative calculations reveal the cooling and increase in relative humidity almost universally attributed to eclipse events. In addition, a <b>slackening</b> <b>of</b> wind speeds by up to about 2 knots in already weak winds and backing in wind direction of about 20 degrees under clear skies across middle England are attributed to the eclipse event. The <b>slackening</b> <b>of</b> wind speed {{is consistent with the}} previously reported boundary layer stabilisation during eclipse events. Wind direction changes have previously been attributed to a large-scale `eclipse-induced cold-cored cyclone', mountain slope flows, and changes in the strength of sea breezes. A new explanation is proposed here by analogy with nocturnal wind changes at sunset and shown to predict direction changes consistent with those observed...|$|R
60|$|He heard a gasp that {{slid into}} a groan of despair, {{and felt a}} <b>slackening</b> <b>of</b> the rope that made him claw. Immediately the rope {{tightened}} again. Straining his eyes in an upward look along the steep slope, he stared a moment, then saw the knife, point first, slide over the verge of the bulge and down upon him. He tucked his cheek to it, shrank from the pang of cut flesh, tucked more tightly, and felt the knife come to rest.|$|R
30|$|Globalization, {{one of the}} two key megatrends of {{the sixth}} wave, will {{essentially}} mean rebalancing the global economic power system. Led by China and India, the Southern hemisphere countries are developing fast. The growth in China in particular is unprecedented: if its economy continues to grow at the present rate, it may in the next 10  years overtake the USA and the European Union. 3 On the other hand, there are some signals to show the <b>slackening</b> <b>of</b> the speed [11].|$|R
60|$|Another {{circumstance}} {{conspired to}} make their landing more difficult, which Mountclere knew nothing of. With the wind easterly, the highest sea prevailed in Knollsea Bay from the <b>slackening</b> <b>of</b> flood-tide to the first hour of ebb. At that time the water outside stood without a current, and ridges and hollows chased each other towards the beach unchecked. When the tide was setting strong up or down Channel its flow across {{the mouth of the}} bay thrust aside, to some extent, the landward plunge of the waves.|$|R
