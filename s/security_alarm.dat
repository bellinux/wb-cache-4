Wiens collapsed and was apprehended after one of the judges pointed out that not Okaz but Wiens was the assailant. While under arrest, Wiens resisted and begged the police officer to shoot him dead. Okaz, critically wounded in the stabbing attack, was in a coma for two days. He was subsequently treated for several weeks in a hospital near Dresden for the stabbing and shooting injuries. El-Sherbini died in the court building at 11:07, succumbing to her injuries.|$|E
5|$|Hideo Kojima's Metal Gear, {{released}} in 1987 for the MSX2 and the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1988, utilized stealth elements within an action-adventure framework, {{and was the}} first mainstream stealth game to be released on consoles. Since the MSX2 was not available in North America, only the NES version was released there. Metal Gear placed a greater emphasis on stealth than other games of its time, with the player character Solid Snake beginning without any weapons (requiring him to avoid confrontation until weapons are found) and having limited ammunition for each weapon. Enemies are able to see Snake from a distance (using a line-of-sight mechanic) and hear gunshots from non-silenced weapons; security cameras and sensors are placed at various locations, and a <b>security</b> <b>alarm</b> sounds whenever Snake is spotted and causes all enemies on screen to chase him. Snake could also disguise himself in enemy uniform or a cardboard box, and use his fists to fight enemies.|$|E

These detectors don't need to have built in alarms, as alarm systems can be controlled by the connected FACP, which will set off relevant alarms, and can also implement complex functions such as a staged evacuation.|$|E

40|$|Masteroppgave i helse- og sosialinformatikk- Universitetet i Agder, 2016 The {{theme of}} this study is <b>security</b> <b>alarms</b> and {{information}} flow. The background for the study is estimates regarding an upcoming growing number of <b>security</b> <b>alarms</b> in municipal healthcare services, recommendations on the transition from analogue to digital <b>security</b> <b>alarms,</b> and reports on the current organization of the safety alarms of varying quality and low efficiency (Frantzen, 2014; Fensli, 2015 Kvernland-Berg, 2014). Purpose The aim {{of this study was to}} find what importance access to information and information flow had in the working process with <b>security</b> <b>alarms</b> for a future-oriented health services. Method The survey applied a deductive approach. We used a cross-sectional study and a quantitative method. Electronic questionnaire was used as data collection instrument. The poll of respondents consisted of 219. 100 respondents answered the survey, which gives a response rate of 45. 6 %. Results and conclusion We can conclude that the majority of respondents had access to information to a large extent, some however missed information. The information which was missed the most was user`s diagnoses and a list of granted services provided by the health care in the municipality. Having access to this information seems to be of importance for the assessment of <b>security</b> <b>alarms</b> and for cooperation between staff in the alarm chain. Technical problems seem to have an impact on the flow of information and in some cases stop it. Only 14 % answered that delay in the response time was due to lack of information. We see that the response time may be related to the municipality's geographical area and number of dedicated personnel. Several respondents experienced handling <b>security</b> <b>alarms</b> as a burden in their everyday work. This seems to be due to the lack of dedicated time for handling <b>security</b> <b>alarms.</b> There are divided opinions among the respondents about the need for a reorganization. Still, we argue for a change in the current organization in order to meet the challenges of tomorrow. We recommend further research to identify the type of assistance needs through the use of <b>security</b> <b>alarms.</b> Keywords: <b>Security</b> <b>alarms,</b> municipal healthcare service, organization, information flo...|$|R
