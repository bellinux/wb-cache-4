40|$|This study {{examined}} the levels of collective and personal self-esteem {{as well as the}} relationships between parental communications and self-esteem in college students in Japan (N= 260) and the U. S. (N= 286). The results showed that the U. S. students reported significantly higher collective self-esteem and higher personal self-esteem than did the Japanese students. Parental communications related to self-esteem differently among Japanese and the U. S. students. Japanese students who had <b>more</b> <b>open</b> communications with their mothers had higher collective and personal self-esteem, whereas those who had <b>more</b> <b>open</b> communications with their fathers had higher personal self-esteem. In contrast, for the U. <b>S.</b> students, <b>more</b> <b>open</b> communications with either their mothers or fathers was associated with both higher personal and collective self-esteem.

40|$|Density-functional {{calculations}} {{are presented}} for high-pressure structural phases of S and Se. The structural phase diagrams, phonon spectra, electron-phonon coupling, and superconducting {{properties of the}} isovalent elements are compared. We find that with increasing pressure, Se adopts a sequence of ever more closely packed structures (beta-Po, bcc, fcc), while <b>S</b> favors <b>more</b> <b>open</b> structures (beta-Po, simple cubic, bcc). These differences are shown to be attributable to differences in the S and Se core states. All the compressed phases of S and Se considered are calculated to have weak to moderate electron-phonon coupling strengths consistent with superconducting transition temperatures {{in the range of}} 1 to 20 K. Our results compare well with experimental data on the beta-Po [...] > bcc transition pressure in Se and on the superconducting transition temperature in beta-Po S. Further experiments are suggested to search for the other structural phases predicted at higher pressures and to test theoretical results on the electron-phonon interaction and superconducting properties...|$|R
40|$|On {{the island}} of Java, Indonesia, two congeneric hawk-eagles occur, i. e. the endemic Javan hawk-eagle Spizaetus bartelsi and the wide-ranging {{changeable}} hawk-eagle S. cirrhatus. Comparisons with similar species-pairs in South East Asia suggest that these species may be competitors both in habitat and diet. The limited area and less-diverse resources of islands should make competition between similar species more acute and should lead to marked niche segregation, with a larger niche breath for the endemic species. Spizaetus bartelsi was recorded significantly more frequently in forest habitats from sea level to 2500 m asl and <b>S.</b> cirrhatus <b>more</b> in <b>open</b> habitats up to 1600 m asl. Contrary to the prediction, the endemic hawk-eagle occurred in a smaller range of habitats (four out of seven) compared to S. cirrhatus that was found in all seven habitat types. Although significant, habitat segregation was not as well marked as in some similar co-occurring species. The relative overlap between the two species may in part result from human influences with the dense continuous rain forest being replaced by <b>more</b> <b>open</b> forest types...|$|R
40|$|Most recent draft here. This study uses new {{measures}} of real exchange rates {{to investigate the}} decline of Amer-ican manufacturing employment in the early 2000 s, comparing it to the smaller decline in the 1980 s. I find that US manufacturing sectors with greater initial exposure to trade in the 1970 s were disproportionately affected by the ensuing dollar appreciation in the 1980 <b>s,</b> and that <b>more</b> <b>open</b> sectors in the 1990 s also suffered comparative declines in output and employment when US unit labor costs appreciated relative to US trading partners. Employment losses in both the 1980 s {{and in the early}} 2000 s were due to in-creased job destruction and suppressed job creation, and appear to exhibit hysteresis. Additionally, <b>more</b> <b>open</b> sectors experienced relative declines in shipments, value-added, investment, production worker wages, and total factor productivity as US relative unit labor costs in manufacturing rose. I explain the persistent effects of exchange rate move-ments on manufacturing using a Melitz model extension with sunk fixed costs, which leads to a dynamic gravity equation whereby shocks to trade have persistent effects that decay over time. The appreciation of US relative unit labor costs can plausibly explain {{more than two-thirds of the}} decline in manufacturing employment in the early 2000 s...|$|R
40|$|Political protests {{are growing}} in {{emerging}} and established emocracies. Since the 1970 s, {{the demand for}} political participation has become obvious. The 1990 <b>s</b> saw <b>more</b> <b>open</b> dialogue-oriented participatory instruments, which began to be implemented in some countries (‘century of participation’). The proliferation of participatory instruments {{in the field of}} talk centric deliberative democracies has been called the ‘deliberative turn’ (Dryzek, 2002). A new push is also attributed to the open government data, the movement initiated by the US President Obama’s government when it set up its open government data initiative in 2009. These include online and offline participation (Kersting, 2013). It is a practice that most new instruments of participation are implemented at the local level. It is frequently argued that these deliberative forums do not lead to binding decisions. However, compared to elections, the number of citizens participating is rather small and selective. New forms of vote-centric direct democracy such as referenda and other initiatives are implemented in some countries. The paper presents a model of offline and online participation. The focus will be on representative and direct democratic participation. Participation in elections and proliferation of referenda and initiatives will be analysed. Participation in these spheres of numeric democracy can lead to binding decisions. Legal frameworks of different European countries is presented and compared. Is the turnout at the local level small and declining? Who is included and who is excluded? In the empirical part, the article predominantly uses the analyses of the latest survey data from representative comparative opinion polls such as the World Value Survey (WVS) ...|$|R
40|$|With the women's {{movement}} of the 1960 <b>s,</b> <b>more</b> career opportunities <b>opened</b> to women. Women now {{had the opportunity to}} work fulltime at jobs that were once held by men only. Accordingly, female reporters became a larger part of the newsroom, but male and female reporters were not being treated equally. For example, female reporters were assigned news topics that included human interest and education, and male reporters were assigned stories dealing with war and politics. Past research has examined bylines of small, medium, and large newspapers and the news topics male and female reporters have covered. The present study is a content analysis examining the years 1965, 1975, 1985, 1995, and 2005 of the New York Times. The study examined male and female bylines, along with topics of news stories, sources used by male and female reporters, and collective sources. The findings suggest that female reporters are making some strides in the newspaper business. Stories by female reporters more often appear on the front page currently than in the past. However, male reporters are writing about "feminine topics," such as education, and human interest. Lastly, female reporters use more female sources in stories than their male counterparts.

40|$|Spatial {{meanings}} of the English verb-particle out and the Russian prefix vy- in verbs of motion Our research {{is based on a}} set of schemas worked out by S. Lindner (1981) for the verb particle (Vp) out. We have used the same approach for the Russian prefix vy- in order to compare the semantics of space expressed by both out and vy-. Both verbal modifiers denote outward movement from one space (container) into another. In the research the containers (spaces) were grouped by physical conditions: house and street, water and land, rain, darkness, light, forest and parts of one space. What remains unclear is the relation between the two spaces in terms of their closeness and openness. We hypothesize that in Russian and English languages in the situation of leaving one space and entering another the first space (S 1) is a container and thus is more closed, whereas the second space (<b>S</b> 2) is <b>more</b> <b>open.</b> This condition stipulates the usage of Vp out and prefix vy-.
