50|$|When {{a packet}} (or byte, on {{telephone}} switches) {{comes to the}} input, the switch stores the data in RAM in one sequence, and reads {{it out in a}} different <b>sequence.</b> <b>Switch</b> designs vary, but typically, a repeating counter is incremented with an internal clock. It typically wraps-around to zero. The RAM location chosen for the incoming data is taken from a small memory indexed by the counter. It is usually a location for the desired output time-slot. The current value of the counter also selects the RAM data to forward in the current output time slot. Then the counter is incremented to the next value. The switch repeats the algorithm, eventually sending data from any input time-slot to any output time-slot.|$|E

The work was planned and some equipment was on site before the Second World War but the installation was not commissioned until 1949. Searchlight colour light signals and electric point machines were controlled from switch panels. The interlocking equipment was unique being a <b>sequence</b> <b>switch</b> interlocking system manufactured by Standard Telephone Company using telephone switching techniques to the technical specification of the signal engineer of the then Southern Area of the London and North Eastern Railway. The sequence switches consisted of a rotary contact shaft which was rotated to a route position and proved a circuit through contact wipers. Each switch had a [...] "home" [...] position and eleven route positions. When a route was initiated, a clutch was engaged on the appropriate switch to rotate it into its correct position thus setting up the appropriate interlocking circuits through other switches and relays. The installations proved to be remarkably reliable, serving a very useful purpose but were eventually life expired.|$|E

Pens of pigs were weighed and allotted randomly to 1 of 4 dietary treatments. Dietary treatments were: (1) feeding a corn-soybean meal-based diet; (2) feeding an alternative ingredient-based diet; (3) feeding both diets in succession by feeding 2 wk of the corn-soybean meal-based diet followed by 2 wk of the diet with alternative ingredients, then feeding the corn-soybean meal-based diet again for 2 wk (Switch 1); or (4) feeding both diets in succession by feeding 2 wk of the diet with alternative ingredients followed by 2 wk of the cornsoybean meal-based diet, then feeding the diet with alternative ingredients again for 2 wk (Switch 2). Nutrient specifications of the corn-soybean meal-based diet and alternative ingredient-based diet were similar within phase, and diets were fed in 2 phases (Phase 1 : 4 wk, and Phase 2 : 2 wk). Pigs were weighed and feed intake was recorded by pen on d 0, 13, 27, and 41 to determine ADG, ADFI, and F/G. Although performance among pigs fed the different dietary treatments was variable throughout the testing periods, dietary treatment did not affect (P ≥ 0. 07) overall ADG or ADFI. This resulted in pigs being of similar (P = 0. 41) off-test weight, regardless of the diet (corn-soybean meal-based or alternative ingredient-based diets) or diet <b>sequence</b> (<b>Switch</b> 1 or Switch 2).
