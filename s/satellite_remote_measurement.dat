40|$|A {{proposed}} S-band radiometer {{for determining}} the ocean surface temperature with an absolute accuracy of + or - 1 Kelvin and a resolution of + or -. 1 Kelvin was placed under the Advanced Applications Flight Experiment for further development into Nimbus readiness state. The results of assessing the following are described: effects due {{to the state of}} the sea surface, effects caused by the intervening atmosphere, and effects associated with imperfections in the instrument itself. An extensive sea truth program is also described for correlation of aircraft test flight measurements or of <b>satellite</b> <b>remote</b> <b>measurement</b> to in-situ data. An improved radiometer design is a modified Dicke-switch type with temperature stabilized, microwave integrated circuit, front-end and with a pulsed injection-noise nulling system.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the effects of}} non-Lambertian reflection from a homogeneous surface on remote sensing of the surface reflectance and vegetation index from a <b>satellite.</b> <b>Remote</b> <b>measurement</b> of the surface characteristics is perturbed by atmospheric scattering of sun light. This scattering tends to smooth the angular dependence of non-Lambertian surface reflectances, an effect that is not present {{in the case of}} Lambertian surfaces. This effect is calculated to test the validity of a Lambertian assumption used in remote sensing. For the three types of vegetations considered in this study, the assumption of Lambertian surface can be used satisfactorily in the derivation of surface reflectance from remotely measured radiance for a view angle outside the backscattering region. Within the backscattering region, however, the use of the assumption can result in a considerable error in the derived surface reflectance. Accuracy also deteriorates with increasing solar zenith angle. The angular distribution of the surface reflectance derived from remote measurements is smoother than that at the surface. The effect of surface non-Lambertianity on remote sensing of vegetation index is very weak. Since the effect is similiar in the visible and near infrared part of the solar spectrum for the vegetations treated in this study, it is canceled in deriving the vegetation index. The effect of the diffuse skylight on surface reflectance measurements at ground level is also discussed...|$|E

Brightness temperatures of sea water surfaces of varying roughness, of terrain with varying soil moisture, and of sea ice of varying structure were observed. In each case, around truth information was available for correlation with the microwave brightness temperature. The utility of passive microwave radiometry in determining ocean surface wind speeds, at least for values higher than 7 meters/second has been demonstrated. In addition, it was shown that radiometric signatures can be used to determine soil moisture in unvegetated terrain to within five percentage points by weight. Finally, it was demonstrated that first year thick, multi-year, and first year thin sea ice can be distinguished by observing their differing microwave emissivities at various wavelengths...|$|R

In southern Califor-nia, rivers {{are known to}} be the dominant source of littoral, shelf and basin sediment and coastal pollution, although a basic understanding of the dynamics of these river inputs does not exist. Here we evaluate forcing parameters of a southern California river plume using ship-based hydrographic surveys and <b>satellite</b> <b>remote</b> sensing <b>measurements</b> to provide the first insights of river dispersal dynamics in southern California. Our results suggest that plumes of the Santa Clara River are strongly influenced by river inertia, producing jet-like structures 10 km offshore during annual recurrence (two-year) flood events and 30 km during excep-tional (10 -year recurrence) floods. Upwelling-favor-able winds may be strong following stormwater events and can alter dispersal pathways of these plumes. Due to similar runoff relationships and other reported satellite observations, we hypothesize that interia-dominated dispersal may be an important characteristic of the small, mountainous rivers throughout southern California...|$|R

For the first time, we show comparisons of GOMOS 500 nm particle extinction profiles with the ones of other satellite occultation instruments (SAGE II, SAGE III and POAM III), of which the good agreement lends credibility to the GOMOS data set. Yearly zonal statistics are presented for the entire period considered. Time series furthermore convincingly show an important new finding: the sensitivity of GOMOS to the sulfate input by moderate volcanic eruptions such as Manam (2005) and Soufrière Hills (2006). Finally, PSCs are well observed by GOMOS and a first qualitative analysis of the data agrees well with the theoretical PSC formation temperature. Therefore, the importance of the GOMOS aerosol/cloud extinction profile data set is clear: a long-term data record of PSCs, subvisual cirrus, and background and volcanic aerosols in the UTLS region, consisting of hundreds of thousands of altitude profiles with near-global coverage, with the potential to fill the aerosol/cloud extinction data gap left behind after the discontinuation of occultation instruments such as SAGE II, SAGE III and POAM III...|$|R

40|$|The Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) {{retrieved}} from <b>satellite</b> <b>remote</b> sensing <b>measurements</b> such as from MISR and MODIS, both onboard the Terra platform, {{are widely used}} for studying regional and global patterns of aerosol loading. Aerosol products from these sensors are also used for analyzing feedbacks and relationship between aerosols and climatic variables including clouds, precipitation, and radiation fluxes. Several statistical techniques leading {{to the understanding of}} such relationships, including empirical orthogonal function and temporal trend extraction methods, require spatially complete AOD data records. Inherent to remote sensing of aerosols, cloud cover significantly affects aerosol retrievals and results in missing data across the AOD products. This paper demonstrates widely-used geostatistical techniques, such as Co-Kriging (CK) and Regression Kriging (RK), for spatially-filling missing data in the MISR AOD product for the period 2001 - 2013. Among the unique characteristics of this data-filling algorithm is that it utilizes additional AOD information obtained from MODIS. The mean accuracy of the predicted MISR AOD using CK method is estimated to be 0. 05, globally. The gap-filled MISR AOD data are also compared with 131 ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) stations, located around the world. It is found that Root Mean Squared Error of the gap-filled AOD dataset and the original MISR AOD product with respect to AERONET data are 0. 143.

The deployment phase will occur in July, 2002 in southern Florida, USA. Several aircraft will be used, including the ER- 2 and Proteus for cloud remote sensing, the WB- 57 and Citation for in situ cloud measurements, the P- 3 with a Doppler radar for characterization of convective systems, and the Twin otter for sampling of inflow airmasses. In addition, numerous ground-based and <b>satellite</b> <b>remote</b> sensing <b>measurements</b> will be contributing.

40|$|The {{atmosphere}} contains {{solid and}} liquid particles (aerosols) and clouds, which interact with the incoming and outgoing radiation in a complex and spatially very variable manner. Aerosol particles are a largely natural, though highly variable, component of our atmosphere. Aerosols affect our environment at the local, regional, and global levels. There are many factors that are known to influence climate, both natural and human-induced. The increase in concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols through human activity is of particular concern. The effect of the increasing amount of aerosols on the radiative forcing is not yet well known. Regional patterns of climate change depend significantly on the time dependence of the forcing, the spatial distribution of aerosol concentrations and details of the modelled climate processes. Determination of aerosol optical depth from <b>satellite</b> <b>remote</b> sensing <b>measurements</b> is extremely complex due to the large variability of aerosol optical properties. Significant simplification occurs when measurements are taken over water since the ocean reflection signal can be taken as negligible in the near infrared. Unfortunately, over land, most of the signal {{can be attributed to}} ground reflectance.

40|$|The Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (GEO BON) is {{developing}} the Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBVs) {{as the key}} variables needed, on a regular and global basis, to understand and monitor changes in the Earth's biodiversity. A subset of these EBVs {{can be derived from}} space-based remote sensing, within this paper referred to as remotely sensed EBVs (RS-EBVs). Given the global, periodic and standardized character of <b>satellite</b> <b>remote</b> sensing measures, RS-EBVs may be seen as easier to generate than non-remotely sensed EBVs, which have to be assembled from disparate and local sources of information. Particularly because they are global and periodic, RS-EBVs are of special relevance for monitoring the state of and changes to biodiversity, notably the structure and function of ecosystems. If well developed, RS-EBVs can provide key information for global biodiversity assessments as well as for national governments to meet their obligations under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), in particular to formulate and implement appropriate management responses to biodiversity losses. However, the relevance and usage of globally produced RS-EBVs in wide-scale ecological modelling, such as in species distribution and abundance studies or in ecosystem integrity analyses, are still to be demonstrated, in particular when it comes to deriving biodiversity indicators for policy making and implementation. The biodiversity community at large, from those conducting scientific ecological studies to those involved in the development of remote sensing applications for biodiversity monitoring, can gain value from RS-EBVs, but doing so requires close cooperation with space agencies. Effective interaction is only likely to result if the biodiversity community understands how space agencies determine their observation and product requirements. To develop these requirements, space agencies need to precisely specify the physical measurements for their spaceflight instruments, as well as the algorithmic approaches, to generate RS-EBV products from these measurements. Here, we address the biodiversity community to discuss the role space agencies should play in the development of EBVs arising from <b>satellite</b> <b>remote</b> sensing. Importantly, we explain the necessity for translating the observational needs of the biodiversity community into specific <b>satellite</b> <b>remote</b> sensing <b>measurement</b> and algorithm requirements. By summarizing the prerequisite conditions that are required for obtaining a collective and strong engagement of space agencies in the co-development of RS-EBVs, we aim to facilitate collaborative efforts between the biodiversity community and the space agencies, which can ultimately contribute to a global and comprehensive biodiversity knowledge system...|$|R

We review the development of TLS as a plotscale measurement tool, including the evolution of both instrument hardware and key data processing methodologies. We highlight two broad data modelling approaches of gap probability and geometrical modelling and the basic theory that underpins these.

Regional science {{is the study}} of social problems that have a spatial dimension. The availability of <b>satellite</b> <b>remote</b> sensing data has increased significantly in the last two decades, and these data constitute a useful data source for mapping the composition of urban settings and analyzing changes over time. The increasing spatial resolution of commercial satellite imagery has influenced the emergence of new research and applications of regional science in urban settlements because it is now possible to identify individual objects of the urban fabric. The most common applications found in the literature are the detection of urban deprivation hot spots, quality of life index assessment, urban growth analysis, house value estimation, urban population estimation and urban social vulnerability assessment. The <b>satellite</b> <b>remote</b> sensing imagery used in these applications has medium, high or very high spatial resolution, such as images from Landsat MSS, Landsat TM and ETM+, SPOT, ASTER, IRS, Ikonos and QuickBird.

Different VI 2 ̆ 7 s showed markedly different radiometric properties, and as a result, influenced phenophase estimates.
