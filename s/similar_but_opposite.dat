40|$|AbstractEphrin-A 2 and -A 5 {{are thought}} to be anteroposterior mapping labels for the retinotectal/retinocollicular projection. Here, gene {{disruptions}} of both these ephrins are characterized. Focal retinal labeling reveals moderate map abnormalities when either gene is disrupted. Double heterozygotes also have a phenotype, showing an influence of absolute levels. In vitro assays indicate these ephrins are required for repellent activity in the target and also normal responsiveness in the retina. In double homozygotes, anteroposterior order is almost though not completely lost. Temporal or nasal retinal labelings reveal quantitatively <b>similar</b> <b>but</b> <b>opposite</b> shifts, with multiple terminations scattered widely over the target. These results indicate an axon competition mechanism for mapping, with a critical role for ephrins as anteroposterior topographic labels.

40|$|Rotational {{deformities}} {{are common}} lower extremity abnormalities in children. Rotational problems include in-toeing and out-toeing.

Out-toeing is less common than intoeing, and its causes are <b>similar</b> <b>but</b> <b>opposite</b> to those of intoeing. These include femoral retroversion and external tibial torsion. An accurate diagnosis can be made with careful history and physical examination, which includes torsional profile (a four- component composite of measurements of the lower extremities). Charts of normal values and values with two standard deviations for each component of the torsional profile are available. In most cases, the abnormality improves with time. A careful physical examination, explanation of the natural history, and serial measurements are usually reassuring to the parents. Treatment is usually conservative.

40|$|AbstractWhen Marburg virus (MBGV) {{nucleoprotein}} (NP) {{is expressed}} in insect cells, it binds to cellular RNA and forms NP–RNA complexes such as insect cell-expressed nucleoproteins from other nonsegmented negative-strand RNA viruses. Recombinant MBGV NP–RNA forms loose coils that resemble rabies virus N–RNA. MBGV NP monomers are rods that are spaced along the coil similar to the nucleoprotein monomers of the rabies virus N–RNA. High salt treatment induces tight coiling of the MBGV NP–RNA, again a characteristic observed for other nonsegmented negative-strand virus N–RNAs. Electron microscopy of fixed Marburg virus particles shows that the viral nucleocapsid has a smaller diameter than the free, recombinant NP–RNA. This difference in helical parameters could be caused by the interaction of other viral proteins with the NP–RNA. A <b>similar</b> <b>but</b> <b>opposite</b> phenomenon is observed for rhabdovirus nucleocapsids that are condensed by the viral matrix protein upon which they acquire a larger diameter. Finally, {{there appears to be}} an extensive and regular protein scaffold between the viral nucleocapsid and the membrane that seems not to exist in the other negative-strand RNA viruses...|$|E
40|$|The firm {{geographic}} location matters in IPOs because investors {{have a strong}} preference for newly issued local stocks and provide abnormal demand in local offerings. Using equity holdings data for more than 53, 000 households, we show the probability to participate {{to the stock market}} and the proportion of the equity wealth is abnormally increasing with the volume of the IPOs inside the investor region. Upon nearly the universe of the 167, 515 going public and private domestic manufacturing firms, we provide consistent evidence that the isolated private firms have higher probability to go public, larger IPO underpricing cross-sectional average and volatility, and less pronounced long-run under-performance. <b>Similar</b> <b>but</b> <b>opposite</b> evidence holds for the local concentration of the investor wealth. These effects are economically relevant and robust to local delistings, IPO market timing, agglomeration economies, firm location endogeneity, self-selection bias, and information asymmetries, among others. Findings suggest IPO waves have a strong geographic component, highlight that underwriters significantly under-estimate the local demand component thus leaving unexpected money on the table, and support state-contingent but constant investor propensity for risk...|$|E

An interesting finding is that the adaptation state does not modulate the magnitude of the attentional effect. This suggests that attention affects the normalized signal once the effect of contrast adaptation has taken place and that these two mechanisms act separately to change contrast sensitivity. Attention can overcome adaptation to restore contrast sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|Channel {{activity}} of the calcium release channel from skeletal muscle, ryanodine receptor type 1, was measured in the presence and absence of protamine sulfate on the cytoplasmic side of the channel. Single-channel activity was measured after incorporating channels into planar lipid bilayers. Optimally and suboptimally calcium-activated calcium release channels were inactivated by the application of protamine to the cytoplasmic side of the channel. Recovery of channel activity was not observed while protamine was present. The addition of protamine bound to agarose beads did not change channel activity, implying that the mechanism of action involves an interaction with the ryanodine receptor rather than changes in the bulk calcium concentration of the medium. The block of channel activity by protamine could be reversed either by removal by perfusion with buffer or {{by the addition of}} heparin to the cytoplasmic side of the channel. Microinjection of protamine into differentiated C 2 C 12 mouse muscle cells prevented caffeine-induced intracellular calcium release. The results suggest that protamine acts on the ryanodine receptor in a <b>similar</b> <b>but</b> <b>opposite</b> manner from heparin and that protamine {{can be used as a}} potent, reversible inhibitor of ryanodine receptor activity...|$|E
40|$|Abstract A {{volcanic}} earthquake with Mw 5 : 6 occurred {{beneath the}} Bárdarbunga caldera in Iceland on 29 September 1996. This earthquake {{is one of}} a decade-long sequence ofM 5 events at Bárdarbunga with non-double-couple mechanisms in the Global Centroid Moment Tensor catalog. Fortunately, it was recorded well by the regional-scale Iceland Hotspot Project seismic experiment. We investigated the event with a complete moment tensor inversion method using regional long-period seismic waveforms and a composite structural model. The moment tensor inversion using data from stations of the Iceland Hotspot Project yields a non-double-couple solution with a 67 % vertically oriented compensated linear vector dipole component, a 32 % double-couple component, and a statistically insignificant (2 %) volumetric (isotropic) con-traction. This indicates the absence of a net volumetric component, which is puzzling {{in the case of a}} large volcanic earthquake that apparently is not explained by shear slip on a planar fault. A possible volcanic mechanism that can produce an earthquake without a volumetric component involves two offset sources with <b>similar</b> <b>but</b> <b>opposite</b> volume changes. We show that although such a model cannot be ruled out, the circumstances under which it could happen are rare...|$|E
