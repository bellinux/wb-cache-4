40|$|There is an {{abundance}} of critical hygiene points {{in connection with the}} handling of the head and the harvesting of head tissues. If a wide range of precautions is not taken, then the danger of cross-contamination of carcasses, abattoir workers, the environment, equipment, and even wastewater is unavoidable. The most critical process stage, in terms of edible meat contamination with <b>specified</b> <b>risk</b> <b>material</b> (SRM), is the current common practice of the longitudinal splitting of the carcass. The carcass splitting saw poses a particular risk in terms of cross-contamination of carcasses, equipment, surfaces and operatives. Tissues of central nervous system (CNS) carry almost all of the infectivity in cattle subclinically and clinically affected by the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) agent. Should animals suffering from subclinical BSE enter the usual commercial slaughter procedure, {{it is likely that the}} BSE prion, amongst others, will be disseminated onto the processed carcasses. If such carcasses are consumed by humans this may lead to the development of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). Protocols ensuring the safe handling of head and harvesting of head tissues, alternative methods of spinal column/cord removal for reducing the contamination of carcass and/or the environment and measures for the protection of operatives in the abattoir are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The current {{production}} of wood composites relies mostly on formaldehyde-based adhesives such as urea formaldehyde (UF) and phenol formaldehyde (PF) resins. As these resins are produced from non-renewable resources, {{and there are some}} ongoing issues with possible health hazard due to formaldehyde emission from such products, the purpose of this research was to develop a formaldehyde-free plywood adhesive utilizing waste protein as a renewable feedstock. The feedstock for this work was <b>specified</b> <b>risk</b> <b>material</b> (SRM), which is currently being disposed of either by incineration or by landfilling. In this report, we describe a technology for utilization of SRM for the development of an environmentally friendly plywood adhesive. SRM was thermally hydrolyzed using a Canadian government-approved protocol, and the peptides were recovered from the hydrolyzate. The recovered peptides were chemically crosslinked with polyamidoamine-epichlorohydrin (PAE) resin to develop an adhesive system for bonding of plywood specimens. The effects of crosslinking time, peptides/crosslinking agent ratio, and temperature of hot pressing of plywood specimens on the strength of formulated adhesives were investigated. Formulations containing as much as 78 % (wt/wt) peptides met the ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) specifications of minimum dry and soaked shear strength requirement for UF resin type adhesives. Under the optimum conditions tested, the peptides–PAE resin-based formulations resulted in plywood specimens having comparable dry as well as soaked shear strength to that of commercial PF resin...|$|E

40|$|Eight major {{policies}} were implemented by Japanese Government since Oct. 2001, {{to deal with}} bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). These are; 1) Surveillance in farm by veterinarian, 2) Prion test at healthy 1. 3 mi cows/yr, by veterinarian, 3) Elimination of <b>specified</b> <b>risk</b> <b>material</b> (SRM), 4) Ban of MBM for production, sale use, 5) Prion test for fallen stocks, 6) Transparent information and traceability, 7) New Measures such as Food Safety Basic Law, and 8) Establish of Food Safety Commission in the Cabinet Office. At this moment, the extent of SRM risk has only been indicated by several reports employing tests with a limited sensitivity. There is still a possibility that {{the items in the}} SRM list will increase in the future, and this indiscriminately applies to Japanese cattle as well. Although current practices of SRM elimination partially guarantee total food safety, additional latent problems and imminent issues remain as potential headaches to be addressed. If the index of SRM elimination cannot guarantee reliable food safety, we have but to resort to total elimination of tissues from high risk-bearing and BSE-infected animals. However, current BSE tests have their limitations and can not yet completely detect high-risk and/or infected animals. Under such circumstances, tissues/wastes and remains of diseased, affected fallen stocks and cohort animals have to be eliminated to prevent BSE invading the human food chain systems. The failure to detect any cohort should never be allowed to occur, and with regular and persistent updating of available stringent records, we are at least adopting the correct and useful approach as a reawakening strategy to securing food safety. In this perspective, traceability based on a National Identification System is required...|$|E

40|$|Since 1996, bovine spongiform {{encephalopathy}} (BSE) in cattle {{has been linked to}} a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), a fatal brain disease in man. This paper assessed the cost-effectiveness of BSE control strategies instituted by the European Commission. In a Monte Carlo simulation model, a non-intervention baseline scenario was compared to three intervention strategies: removal of <b>specified</b> <b>risk</b> <b>materials</b> from slaughter animals, post-mortem testing for BSE and the culling of feed and age cohorts of BSE cases. The food risk in the baseline scenario ranged from 16. 98 lost life years in 2002 to 2. 69 lost life years in 2005. Removing <b>specified</b> <b>risk</b> <b>materials</b> removal practices, post-mortem testing and post-mortem testing plus cohort culling reduced this risk with 93 %, 82. 7 % and 83. 1 %. The estimated cost-effectiveness of all BSE measures in The Netherlands ranged from 4. 3 million euros per life year saved in 2002 to 17. 7 million euros in 2005. It was discussed that the cost-effectiveness of BSE control strategies will further deviate from regular health economics thresholds as BSE prevalence and incidence declines...|$|R
50|$|After {{confirmation}} of the first U.S. BSE case, FSIS issued regulations (69 FR 1887, January 12, 2004) prohibiting {{the use of the}} most widely used stunning device (air-injection captive bolt stun gun) because the compressed air device (in contrast to the blank cartridge-driven or non-penetrating captive bolt) has been shown to force pieces of brain and other central nervous system (CNS) tissue into the bloodstream.

40|$|A {{method has}} been {{developed}} to differentiate between non-muscle tissues such as liver, kidney and heart and that of muscle in meat samples using tissue specific DNA detection. Only muscle tissue is considered meat {{from the point of}} view of labelling (Food Labelling [Amendment] (England) Regulations 2003) and Quantitative Ingredient Declaration (QUID), and also certain parts of the carcass are prohibited to be used in raw meat products (Meat Products [England] Regulations 2003). Included in the prohibited offal are brain and spinal cord. The described methodology has therefore been developed primarily to enforce labelling rules but also to contribute to the enforcement of BSE legislation on the detection of Central Nervous System (CNS) tissue. The latter requires the removal of <b>Specified</b> <b>Risk</b> <b>Material</b> (SRM), such as bovine and ovine brain and spinal cord, from the food chain. Current methodologies for detection of CNS tissue include histological examination, analysis of cholesterol content and immunodetection. These can potentially be time consuming, less applicable to processed samples and may not be readily adapted to high throughput sample analysis. The objective of this work was therefore to develop a DNAbased detection assay that exploits the sensitivity and specificity of PCR and is potentially applicable to more highly processed food samples. For neuronal tissue, the DNA target selected was the promoter for Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP), a gene whose expression is restricted to astroglial cells within CNS tissue. The promoter fragments from both cattle and sheep have been isolated and key differences in the methylation patterns of certain CpG dinucleotides in the sequences from bovine and sheep brain and spinal cord and the corresponding skeletal muscle identified. These have been used to design a PCR assay exploiting Methylation Specific PCR (MSP) to specifically amplify the neuronal tissue derived sequence and therefore identify the presence of CNS tissue in an assay sample...|$|E
40|$|Background. Due to the bovine spongiform {{encephalopathy}} (BSE), <b>specified</b> <b>risk</b> <b>material</b> (SRM) as well as animal meat and bone meal (MBM) are banned from the food and feed chain because of a possible infection with pathogenic prions (PrPSc). Nowadays, prions are widely accepted {{to be responsible for}} TSE(transmissible spongiform encephalopathies) -caused illnesses like BSE and scrapie, and especially for the occurrence of the new variant of CJD in humans. Presently, SRM and MBM are burnt under high temperatures to avoid any hazards for humans, animals or the environment. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate a method using animal fat separated from Category I material which includes SRM and the carcasses of TSE-infected animals, or animals suspected of being infected with TSE, as a source for producing biodiesel by transesterification, analogous to the biodiesel process using vegetable oil. Methods. For this purpose, animal fat was spiked with scrapie-infected hamster brain equivalents - as representative for a TSE-infected animal - and the biodiesel manufacturing process was downscaled and performed under lab-scale conditions. Results and Discussion. The results analysed by Western blotting showed clearly that almost each single step of the process leads to a significant reduction of the concentration of the pathogenic prion protein (PrPSc) in the main and side-products. Conclusion. The data revealed that the biodiesel production, even from material with a high concentration of pathogenic prions, can be considered as safe. Recommendations and Outlook. The obtained results indicated that biodiesel produced from prion-contaminated fat was safe under the tested process conditions. However, it has to be pointed out that the results cannot be generalized because a different process control using other conditions may lead to different results and then has to be analysed independently. It is clear that the production of biodiesel from high risk material represents a more economic usage than the combustion of such material...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} the {{development}} and parameterization of a quantitative assessment is described that estimates the amount of TSE infectivity that is present in a whole animal carcass (bovine spongiform encephalopathy [BSE] for cattle and classical/atypical scrapie for sheep and lambs) and the amounts that subsequently {{fall to the floor}} during processing at facilities that handle <b>specified</b> <b>risk</b> <b>material</b> (SRM). BSE in cattle was found to contain the most oral doses, with a mean of 9864 BO ID 50 s (310, 38840) in a whole carcass compared to a mean of 1851 OO ID 50 s (600, 4070) and 614 OO ID 50 s (155, 1509) for a sheep infected with classical and atypical scrapie, respectively. Lambs contained the least infectivity with a mean of 251 OO ID 50 s (83, 548) for classical scrapie and 1 OO ID 50 s (0. 2, 2) for atypical scrapie. The highest amounts of infectivity falling to the floor and entering the drains from slaughtering a whole carcass at SRM facilities were found to be from cattle infected with BSE at rendering and large incineration facilities with 7. 4 BO ID 50 s (0. 1, 29), intermediate plants and small incinerators with a mean of 4. 5 BO ID 50 s (0. 1, 18), and collection centers, 3. 6 BO ID 50 s (0. 1, 14).

40|$|Until the {{pathogen}} of bovine spongiform encephalophathy (BSE) has been eradicated {{and as long}} as new infections are still possible, the removal of <b>specified</b> <b>risk</b> <b>materials</b> (SRMs) is the most effective way of protecting consumers from disease. SRM is the name given to poten-tial BSE-pathogen containing tissue like, for instance the brain, spinal cord and vertebral col-umn of cattle. To prevent SRM material reaching the food chain, it is removed directly after slaughter, dyed and not put to any further use. The <b>specified</b> <b>risk</b> <b>materials</b> that have to be removed depend on age at slaughter. In particular for the removal of the vertebral column as a specific <b>risk</b> <b>material,</b> the European Commission is currently planning to raise the age limit for all healthy, slaughtered cattle from 24 to 30 months. In a joint opinion, the Friedrich Loef-fler Institute (FLI) responsible for animal health and the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) have assessed the EU proposal from the angle of its impact on consumer health pro-tection. According to FLI and BfR the age limit for the removal of the vertebral column as SRM should be raised to 30 months at the earliest in 2008. Assuming a mean incubation period for BSE of between five and six years and the full enforcement of the BSE protective measures introduced in December 2000 by 2002, then there will probably be no further risk of infection from the affected cattle by that time. The raising of the age limit from 2008 onwards would not, therefore, lead to any significant increase in the BSE risk for consumers...|$|R
40|$|Occurring for {{the first}} time in 1986 in the United Kingdom, bovine spongiform {{encephalopathy}} (BSE), the so-called “mad-cow disease”, has had unprecedented consequences in veterinary public health.

40|$|Since 2001 {{when the}} first case of bovine spongiform {{encephalopathy}} (BSE) was identified in the Czech Republic, a total of 27 infected cows have been detected. A single outbreak of BSE in 2007 confirms that, in the Czech Republic, the disease incidence has a decreasing trend, which is {{in agreement with the}} situation in other EU countries. In order to conrol the disease and in the interests of human health protection, the killing of infected animals and related cohorts (groups of potentially infected animals), as well as eliminaton of <b>specified</b> <b>risk</b> <b>material</b> (SRM) were commenced. To reduce the negative impact of these measures on agricultural production it was possible, {{on the basis of the}} Veterinary Act No. 166 / 1999, to compensate the relevant costs to the farmers involved; these were covered by the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic from the budgedary chapter „General Treasury Administration“. Between the outbreak in 2001 and 2007, a total of 1   181   296 cows were examined and, based on the finding of 27 BSE-positive animals, 3   994 cows were subsequently slaughtered. BSE exa­mi­na­tion, killing and decontamination costs amounted to 18. 9 million CZK, compensation costs for killed animals reached almost 163. 9 million CZK and compensation for unaccomplished production accounted for over 13. 6 million CZK. Together with other additional costs, the total financial compensations paid out during the period of BSE presence were almost 197 million CZK. The findings of this study are discussed and compared with rather sparse information available on the costs related to BSE abroad. The available data suggests that the compensations for BSE-related costs paid to farmers in the Czech Republic were proportional to those in the European Union, USA or Canada...|$|E
40|$|The {{conventional}} cattle slaughtering process {{includes some}} critical stages where a dissemination of <b>Specified</b> <b>Risk</b> <b>Material</b> (SRM: brain, spinal cord) within or onto the carcass {{and within the}} slaughterhouse environment can occur. These processes are captive bolt stunning, removal {{of the head and}} first of all carcass splitting (sawing the spine lengthways). Captive bolt (CB) stunning results in massive brain tissue damage with bleeding, and in some cases brain tissue also emerges from the CB hole. As the heart is still functioning, there is a risk of brain tissue particles being transferred v i a the blood flow to heart and lungs or even in the whole carcass. This contamination risk is actually assessed to be low, but a continuing leakage of Central Nervous System (CNS) material from the captive bolt aperture in the further slaughter process may lead to direct and indirect contamination of carcass, meat and equipment. Therefore alternative stunning methods like electrical stunning or concussion stunning are discussed. A further critical point is the treatment of the head. When the head is removed, the spinal cord is cut with a knife. There is a danger of cross contamination due to spinal protein that may adhere to the knife and because of liquid cerebralis, which leaks from the foramen occipitale magnum. Further head cleaning with hand-held hoses following skinning also includes the danger of cross contamination from cleaning water or aerosol. Therefore measures regarding the safe handling of head and harvesting of head meat are proposed. The most critical point in terms of contamination of the meat surface with SRM is the currently common practise of sawing the spine vertically in the middle with hand-guided belt-type saws. A m i x t u r e of sawing residues and rinsing water (sawing sludge) collects in the housing of the saw, and if it contains infectious material this leads to contamination of the subsequent carcasses. The most promising methods available at present for minimising this risk appear to be in manual cattle slaughtering boning the entire (not split) carcass, either still warm or refrigerated and in industrial beef cattle slaughtering extraction of the spinal cord by vacuum from the whole carcass followed by conventional sawing or completely sawing out the spine including spinal ganglia...|$|E
40|$|While so far all {{attention}} was {{directed toward the}} possible transmission of the BSE cattle agent to humans, this work puts the sheep into the foreground as a possible carrier of a TSE to humans. In order to assess the danger of an infection of humans with a prion disease by sheep meat, the available literature was reviewed according to the guidelines of risk analysis by the FAO/WHO 1995. The risk analysis is divided into the sections risk evaluation, risk management and risk communication. The risk evaluation identifies the prion as causing agent of the transmissible spongiforme encephalopathy. The prion (PrPSc) {{is defined as the}} structurally changed and thus pathological form of the cellular prion protein (PrPC), which naturally {{can be found in the}} body. Prions can completely be inactivated only with difficulties, due to their very high tenacity. A rising number of scrapie cases worldwide as well as within Germany characterizes the danger, as stated by evaluations of statistics published by the International Office of Epizootics (OIE). The transmission of prions mainly takes place by oral admission, whereby injuries and inflammations of the mucous membranes of the gastrointestinal tract do promote the admission of prions into the tissue of the intestine. Furthermore, danger is illustrated by the fact that genotypes originally assumed resistant or almost resistant, demonstrably are able to become sick with scrapie. Another danger is represented by the different pathogenesis of BSE in cattle and of scrapie or BSE in sheep. The reason for this is that prions in sheep also spread into the lymphatic system and into some organs. In both diseases, scrapie and BSE, prions are located in the gastrointestinal tract, the lymphatic and nervous system, in spleen, tonsillar, third eyelid, thymus, retina, tongue, adrenal gland and placenta. The BSE agent additionally can be found in liver, blood and musculature. The scrapie agent is probably not human-pathogenic. However, the occurrence of the BSE agent in the sheep population cannot be excluded and, as this agent is pathogenic for humans, it represents a danger. At the time of 2008, no therapy for prion diseases neither for humans nor for animals was available. By consumption of potentially infected tissue the consumer can get into contact with the agent. Infected tissue is available on the marketplace and fitting cooking recipes are easy to find. The evaluation of data from different resources shows an undiminished consumption of sheep meat. In risk characterisation, published contributions from public institutions showed that the risk for the consumer was assessed as low or was not discussed. In risk management the main focus is on EC regulation 999 / 2001, laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. It introduced, among other things, the <b>specified</b> <b>risk</b> <b>material</b> (SRM), regular sample-taking, standardised test procedures, genotyping and the feed prohibition for meat-and-bone meal. Also in context with this regulation is regulation (EC) 854 / 2004 of the EU food-hygiene-package with current regulations for the battle animal and meat investigation. The assessment of risk management led to the result that the accomplished measures are not sufficient to exclude any risk for the consumer caused by prions generated by the consumption of sheep meat, although risk management was already introduced from all relevant ranges. Transmissions of prions is particularly possible during the process of slaughter and carcass dressing and procedures of meat investigation offer further possibilities due to technical deficiencies. The regulations of the SRM do not seize all potentially infectious tissues. There exists a lack in scrapie testing, based on specific test procedures and test material. Prion disease detection is done in the obex region of the medulla oblongata, which does possess prions only in the advanced pathogenesis state. The core of the breeding program and genotyping, do not lead to complete resistant individuals. A further weak point in the management is the still possible market availability of risk tissues of sheep, including SRM. To exclude or limit the appearance of a human-pathogenic TSE agent in the sheep population, the present measures are not sufficient to exclude any risk of infection of consumers from sheep meat...|$|E

40|$|Since 1987, when bovine spongiform {{encephalopathy}} (BSE) emerged as a novel disease in cattle, enormous efforts were undertaken to monitor and control the disease in ruminants worldwide.

The ban on meat and bone meal in livestock feed and the removal of <b>specified</b> <b>risk</b> <b>materials</b> from the food chain were the main measures to successfully prevent infection in cattle and to protect human beings from BSE exposure.

This report briefly reviews and summarizes the current level of knowledge on the spectrum of TSEs in cattle and small ruminants and addresses the question of the extent to which such atypical TSEs have an effect on disease surveillance and control strategies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) is a virulent disease {{which may}} infect by {{affecting}} {{the central nervous}} system (CNS) tissues in cattle and causes degeneration in nerves. Central nervous system tissues such as brain and spinal cord which are classified as <b>specified</b> <b>risk</b> <b>materials</b> (SRMs) are regarded to be main source of infection. The contamination of the meat with the specific <b>risk</b> <b>materials</b> (SRMs) can occur in phases of slaughter, fragmentation of carcass and processing. This study was conducted in order to investigate the existence of CNS tissues in raw meat ball (cig kofte) which is commonly consumed in the Southeastern Region of Turkey, particularly in &# 350;anl&# 305;urfa. For this purpose, 145 samples of raw meat ball were tested. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (Ridascreen <b>risk</b> <b>material</b> 10 / 5, R-biofarm GmbH) which determine glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) as determinant were used. As a result of the analyses, positivity was detected in 21 of totally 145 samples of raw meat ball (14. 48 %). 6 (4. 14 %) of the samples gave low level of positivity (&# 8805; 0. 1 standard absorbance), 10 (6. 90 %) gave medium level of positivity (> 0. 2 standard absorbance) and 5 (3. 45 %) gave high level of positivity (&# 8805; 0. 5 standard absorbance). As a consequence, meats are contaminated in any phase of both slaughter and meat production even if accidentally. Regarding this matter, necessary measures should be taken and hygiene rules should be applied...|$|R
40|$|Prions {{are highly}} {{resistant}} to common proteases and conventional sterilisation processes. Consequently, prion infectivity is destroyed by {{methods such as}} incineration, alkaline and thermal hydrolysis. These harsh, destructive and potentially hazardous methods are unsuitable for processing <b>specified</b> <b>risk</b> <b>materials</b> (SRM) and animal by-products, and in the decontamination of medical and laboratory devices, and prion contaminated environments. Thus an environmentally friendly, enzymatic degradation and decontamination process is a highly desirable alternative. The structural similarity of prion and feather keratin suggests that feather degrading microorganisms {{have the potential to}} degrade prions. The objective of this research was to isolate and characterise microbial keratinase and to investigate its ability to degrade ME 7 scrapie prion. Thirty two microbial strains were isolated on feather meal agar from primary effluent and farmyard wastes. One of the isolates, a Grams positive bacterium, demonstrated ignificant keratinolytic activity (11. 00 ± 0. 71 U/ml), and was investigated further. The isolate was identified by 16 S rDNA and designated as Bacillus licheniformis N 22, and was deposited in National Collection of Industrial Food and Marine Bacteria (NCIMB). The growth conditions for optimum keratinase synthesis in a minimal growth medium (MGM) were found to be pH 8. 5, 50 °C, 1. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract To {{establish}} bovine {{spongiform encephalopathy}} (BSE) public health protection measures {{it is important to}} precisely define the cattle tissues considered as <b>specified</b> <b>risk</b> <b>materials</b> (SRM). To date, in pre-clinical BSE infected cattle, no evidence of the BSE agent had been found in the gut outside of the ileal Peyer's Patches. This study was undertaken to determine when and where the pathological prion protein (PrP Sc) and/or BSE infectivity {{can be found in the}} small intestine of cattle 4 to 6 months of age, orally challenged with BSE. Samples of the jejunum, the ileum and the ileocaecal junction from 46 BSE infected cattle, culled from 1 up to 44 months post infection (mpi) were examined by immunohistochemistry. Samples from cattle 8 mpi to 20 mpi were additionally studied by PTA Western blot, rapid tests, and by mouse (TgbovXV) bioassay. In doing so nearly all of the cattle, from 4 up to 44 mpi, had detectable amounts of PrP Sc and/or infectivity in the distal ileum. In the distal ileum clear time-dependent variations were visible concerning the amount of PrP Sc, the tissue structures affected, and the cells involved. BSE infectivity was found not only in the ileum and ileocaecal junction but also in the jejunum. The systematic approach of this study provides new data for qualitative and quantitative risk assessments and allows defining bovine SRM more precisely. </p...|$|R
40|$|The prion {{agent is}} {{notoriously}} resistant to common proteases and conventional sterilisation procedures. The current methods known to destroy prion infectivity such as incineration, alkaline and thermal hydrolysis are harsh, destructive, environmentally polluting and potentially hazardous, thus limit their applications for decontamination of delicate medical and laboratory devices, remediation of prion contaminated environment and for processing animal by-products including <b>specified</b> <b>risk</b> <b>materials</b> and carcases. Therefore, an environmentally friendly, non-destructive enzymatic degradation approach is highly desirable. A feather-degrading Bacillus licheniformis N 22 keratinase has been isolated which degraded scrapie prion to undetectable level of PrP(Sc) signals {{as determined by}} Western Blot analysis. Prion infectivity was verified by ex vivo cell-based assay. An enzymatic formulation combining N 22 keratinase and biosurfactant derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa degraded PrP(Sc) at 65 °C in 10 min to undetectable level -. A time-course degradation analysis carried out at 50 °C over 2 h revealed the progressive attenuation of PrP(Sc) intensity. Test of residual infectivity by standard cell culture assay confirmed that the enzymatic formulation reduced PrP(Sc) infectivity to undetectable levels as compared to cells challenged with untreated standard scrapie sheep prion (SSBP/ 1) (p-value = 0. 008 at 95 % confidence interval). This novel enzymatic formulation has significant potential application for prion decontamination in various environmentally friendly systems under mild treatment conditions...|$|R

International audienceScience-based control {{measures}} (such as the ban of {{the inclusion of}} meat and bone meal in feed {{and the removal of}} potentially BSE infected animal tissues, the so called <b>specified</b> <b>risk</b> <b>materials,</b> from the feed/food chains) by the EU and elsewhere resulted in the continuous decline of the BSE epidemic in recent years. The pressure to lift certain {{control measures}} led the European Commission to issue a TSE Roadmap allowing an open discussion on the potential for regulation relaxation. To investigate the risk perceptions of stakeholders and how to improve the communication in dealing with the TSE roadmap a qualitative social research has been carried out. Forty-six in-depth, semi-structured face-to-face interviews with risk managers and stakeholders were obtained in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom. The main results obtained may be summarized as follows. TSE is not longer a hot topic: the interviewees shared the view that the TSE risk is clearly on decline and the overall BSE (and TSE) risk perception is low. Moreover all examined stakeholders appreciated the TSE Roadmap as a new communication strategy; however they provided several suggestions to improve the communication in the field of TSE...|$|R
40|$|Prion {{protein is}} central to Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE) pathogenesis. Characteristically prion is {{resistant}} to conventional methods of sterilization and {{the most effective means}} of its degradation are incineration and alkaline hydrolysis. These methods are limited by environmental acceptability, application compatibility, cost and loss of reusable materials. Enzymatic degradation provides a viable alternative for decontaminating animal carcasses, <b>specified</b> <b>risk</b> <b>materials,</b> as well as surgical and dentistry instruments. The objective of this research was to isolate and characterise microbial keratinases and to investigate their ability to degrade keratinaceous materials and possibly scrapie prions. Microbial isolates from farmyard waste were grown on feather meal medium and the synthesised keratinase characterised by MALDI-MS and SDS-PAGE. Keratinolytic activity was determined using keratin azure, casein and melanised feather as substrates. Degradation of scrapie prion was evaluated by western blotting analysis. One specific isolates, identified as a strain of Bacillius licheniformis, demonstrated considerable promise. The molecular weight of the enzyme produced by this bacteria was found to be ≈ 28 KDa, with optimum pH and temperature at 8. 0 and 50 °C respectively. This novel keratinase demonstrated significant activity on keratin azure (11 U/mL) and casein substrates, and completely degraded melanised feather within 48 h. Western blotting analysis shows significant reduction in prion signal and immunoreactivity for scrapie infected mouse (ME 7) brain homogenate after incubation with this keratinase. Inclusion of a biosurfactant also further enhanced degradation of scrapie prion. The ability of this novel bacterial keratinase to degrade keratin materials and scrapie prion suggests its potential use as an environmental alternative in prion decontamination and other applications...|$|R
40|$|Background. Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) or prion {{diseases}} are a unique group of neurodegenerative diseases {{of animals and}} humans, which always have a fatal outcome and are transmissible among animals of the same or different species. Scope and Approach. The aim of this work is to review some recent data about animal TSEs, {{with the emphasis on}} their causative agents and zoonotic potential, and to discuss why the surveillance and control measures over animal TSEs should remain in force. Key Findings and Conclusions. We still have incomplete knowledge of prions and {{prion diseases}}. Scrapie has been present {{for a very long time}} and controlled with varied success. Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) emerged unnoticed, and spread within a few years to epidemic proportions, entailing enormous economic consequences and public concerns. Currently, the classical BSE epidemic is under control, but atypical cases do, and probably will, persist in bovine populations. The Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) of the cervids has been spreading in North America and has recently been detected in Europe. Preventive measures for the control of classical BSE remain in force, including the feed ban and removal of <b>specified</b> <b>risk</b> <b>materials.</b> However, active BSE surveillance has considerably decreased. In the absence of such preventive and control measures, atypical BSE cases in healthy slaughtered bovines might persist in the human food chain, and BSE prions might resurface. Moreover, other prion strains might emerge and spread undetected if the appropriate preventive and surveillance measures were to cease, leaving behind inestimable consequences...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{concerns}} about {{a link between}} variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans and similar prion protein-induced disease in cattle, i. e., bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), strict controls are in place to exclude BSE-positive animals and/or <b>specified</b> <b>risk</b> <b>materials</b> including bovine central nervous system (CNS) tissue from the human food chain. However, current slaughter practice, using captive bolt guns, may induce disruption of brain tissues and mobilize CNS tissues into the bovine circulatory system, leading to the dispersion of CNS tissues (including prion proteins) throughout the derived carcass. This project used a marker (antibiotic-resistant) strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens to model the effects of commercial captive bolt stunning procedures on the movement of mobilized CNS material within slaughtered animals and the abattoir environment. The marker organism, introduced by injection through the bolt entry aperture or directly using a cartridge-fired captive bolt, was detected in the slaughter environment immediately after stunning and in the abattoir environment at each subsequent stage of the slaughter-dressing process. The marker organism was also detected on the hands of operatives; on slaughter equipment; and in samples of blood, organs, and musculature of inoculated animals. There {{were no significant differences}} between the results obtained by the two inoculation methods (P < 0. 05). This study demonstrates that material present in, or introduced into, the CNS of cattle during commercial captive bolt stunning may become widely dispersed across the many animate and inanimate elements of the slaughter-dressing environment and within derived carcasses including meat entering the human food chain...|$|R
40|$|A bovine spongiform {{encephalopathy}} (BSE) testing programme at the abattoir started in 2001 in France. A total of 5 281 293 bovines were tested in 2001 and 2002; 87 were found positive in 2001 – 37 per million (95 % CI 30 - 46) –, whereas only 71 in 2002 – 24 per million (95 % CI 19 - 30). Logistic regression models were run to compare the prevalence of BSE on successive birth cohorts, using a pair-wise method of controlling for age at testing; the prevalence on the first one, determined on animals slaughtered in 2001, was compared to the prevalence on the following one determined on animals slaughtered in 2002. Five models were performed in order to compare the birth cohorts preceding and following the months of June 1993 (i. e. July 92 –June 93 birth cohort compared to July 93 –June 94 birth cohort) (8. 5 years old cattle), June 1994 (7. 5 years old cattle), June 1995 (6. 5 years old cattle), June 1996 (5. 5 years old cattle) and June 1997 (4. 5 years old cattle). The models were adjusted for the production type of cattle and the test used. The results showed a significant increase (OR = 2. 31, 95 % CI 1. 08 - 4. 9) of the BSE prevalence between the July 93 –June 94 and July 94 –June 95 cohorts, and then a significant decrease {{over the next two}} birth cohorts; the July 95 –June 96 birth cohort was significantly less affected than the July 94 –June 95 one (OR = 0. 46, 95 % CI 0. 27 - 0. 78), and the July 96 –June 97 birth cohort was significantly less affected than the July 95 –June 96 one (OR = 0. 17, 95 % CI 0. 07 - 0. 37). The increase in BSE prevalence between the July 93 –June 94 and July 94 –June 95 cohorts was in agreement with modelling studies, but needs to be confronted to the data on fallen stock at the national level.
