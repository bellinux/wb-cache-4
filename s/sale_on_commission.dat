He says {{that over the next}} 25 years it was his good fortune to be the only person to see, collect and document Tichý's work. Tichý made him presents of bundles of photographs, and Buxbaum bought more bundles from Tichý's neighbor and [...] "surrogate mother", Jana Hebnarová, who has looked after Tichý since his mother's death and been appointed his heir. In 2006, Buxbaum said that he believed his to be the most complete collection of Tichý's photographs, and that he had placed part of it with galleries for <b>sale</b> <b>on</b> <b>commission,</b> with the intention of making it available to museums and collectors to [...] "bequeath it to the world of art".|$|E
50|$|Barclay traded with British colonial America, and had {{connections}} {{particularly in}} Pennsylvania; the firm David Barclay & Sons had connections around 1760 with New York and Philadelphia merchants, and supplied the British military in North America. In {{the years before}} {{the outbreak of the}} American War of Independence, Barclay made use of an existing contact, Benjamin Franklin. The Barclay brothers used their insights into the North American situation as a guide to business strategy, first of all withdrawing from <b>sales</b> <b>on</b> <b>commission,</b> and then reducing their dependence on exporting across the Atlantic. At the end of the War they had closed down their old trade in linen.|$|R

5000|$|In 1804 he left London for Bristol, {{where for}} some years he was largely {{employed}} in painting the portraits of officers embarking for the Peninsular War. Though Hobday earned large sums, he continued to be extravagant and in financial difficulties. In 1817, after the war ended, Hobday returned to the capital, and took a large house in Broad Street, hoping to renew his earlier artistic and social connections. In this he was disappointed even though patronised by N. M. Rothschild, for whom he painted a family group {{at the price of}} a thousand guineas. In 1821 he moved to 54 Pall Mall, which had large galleries attached to it and, after a disastrous speculative venture in a panoramic exhibition, called the [...] "Poecilorama" [...] at the Egyptian Hall, opened these galleries for the <b>sale</b> of pictures <b>on</b> <b>commission.</b> Though supported by all the leading English and many French artists, the venture proved a complete failure, and in 1820 Hobday went bankrupt.|$|R
5000|$|Larkin and Hubbard {{decided to}} market {{directly}} to consumers, and by 1885 had eliminated all middlemen, including their own salesmen. With the money saved <b>on</b> <b>sales</b> <b>commissions,</b> Larkin {{was able to}} offer better Premiums. In 1891, Larkin placed its first large wholesale order, $40,000 (...) worth of piano lamps. The next year it expanded into Morris Chairs worth $80,000 (...) and oak dining chairs worth $125,000 (...) [...] One {{of the most popular}} giveaways was the Chatauqua Desk. For a $10 order of soap, the customer would receive the soap and the desk, a $10 Premium. The idea grabbed the attention of the public, and through further refinement, Larkin began offering a variety of both products and Premiums. The [...] "Combination Box", advertised in the 1890s, offered enough soap and toiletry products to last an average family one year.|$|R

5000|$|The {{office is}} eager to welcome Sabre CEO Jo Bennett (Kathy Bates) to Scranton, and are dazzled by her Southern ways. Jo announces that in {{addition}} to paper, the Dunder Mifflin branches will now sell Sabre printers. When Jo finds out about the two branch managers, she says either Michael (Steve Carell) or Jim (John Krasinski) must go back to being a salesman. Both are initially reluctant to be demoted, but Pam (Jenna Fischer) points out to Jim in the Sabre manual that since Sabre has multiple incentive programs and no cap <b>on</b> <b>sales</b> <b>commissions</b> (the part about limitless commissions has changed by the episode [...] "WUPHF.com", where the ceiling for revenue is high but capped on a yearly basis), he would make much more money being demoted back to salesman. Jim tells Michael that he will go back to sales and Michael can keep his sole manager spot, and Michael is delighted. However, when Michael learns about the sales commission benefit from Oscar (Oscar Nunez), he sweet talks Jo into demoting him instead. She complies to his demands due to his vast experience, and Michael gloats to Jim.|$|R
