500|$|Salah set up {{a public}} <b>share-holding</b> company, Century Investments. Many Jordanian {{organizations}} criticized Salah for doing business with Israel and boycotted the purchase of output in Jordan. Despite the heavy criticism, Salah nevertheless received tacit support from King Abdullah of Jordan. To combat the boycott, Salah began to work with multinationals with a larger international stake. He then actively lobbied the Jordanian government to set negotiate {{a free trade agreement}} with the United States on the lines of the United States-Israel Free Trade Area Implementation Act of 1985. Faced with little enthusiasm by the Jordanian government, Salah scrutinized the Presidential Proclamation (No. 6955) {{that was part of the}} Palestinian agreement signed between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel in 1993. In the agreement, the areas on the border between Israel and Jordan were designated as [...] "Qualifying Industrial Zones", and goods produced here would not have tariff and quota restrictions to the US markets. Since the Hassan industrial estate in Irbid, where Salah had factories located, was situated far from the bordering areas, it did not qualify for QIZ status.|$|E

By the 1950s, a significant number of shares in the club had passed to Neil and Felicia Grant, who lived in Toomebridge, County Antrim.

[...] Club chairman Robert Kelly's own family <b>share-holding</b> was of a similar size, and he used his close personal relationship with the Toomebridge Grants to ensure his power base at Celtic was unchallengeable. When Neil Grant died in the early 1960s, his shareholding passed to his sister Felicia, leaving her as the largest share-holder in Celtic. This gave rise to the myth amongst Celtic supporters of the [...] "old lady in Ireland" [...] who supposedly had the ultimate say in the running of the club.|$|E

During the early 1880s, mines began yielding large amounts of gold, marking a new era of wealth and prosperity for Gympie.
