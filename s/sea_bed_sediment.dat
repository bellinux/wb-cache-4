The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to simulate, through an interaction of two mathematical models, the current circulation and sediment transport in the Northern part of the Romanian coastal area. The area of study has a length of about 34 km, North â€“ South oriented, between the Sulina and Sf. Gheorghe branches of the Danube River, extending for about 30 km offshore. First a 3 -dimensional hydrodynamic model of 5500 triangular elements is used to simulate the current circulation pattern at different depths in the proximity of the coastal area. Closer to the coast, the resolution of the element is about 200 m. Parameters used as data input were the bathymetry map of the studied zone interpolated with the grid, the wind stress calculated from real values using the formula of Smith and Banke and the liquid discharge of the Danube River. The sediment transport model, that aims to simulate the sediment dynamics, is coupled with the hydrodynamic one and forced by solid discharge and <b>sea</b> <b>bed</b> <b>sediment</b> characteristics. Three ideal situations considering the most frequent wind regimes have been carried out to better understand the general pattern of the circulation. The anti-cyclonal current described in literature could be simulated and analysed with particular meteorological conditions. Subsequently, real data measured in 2002 have been used to force a one year simulation. The results show the presence of seasonal differences in the erosion and deposition dynamics mainly due to different wind regimes...|$|E
40|$|Colour fronts are a {{frequent}} occurrence in False Bay, South Africa, and their occurrence {{has been the}} subject of previous study and anecdotal conjecture. The opportunity arose to make a cross-frontal study of this feature in November 2005. Photographs were taken and, subsequently, satellite imagery was obtained. Measurements were made of temperature, salinity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, suspended solids, plant nutrients and chlorophyll a. Cross-frontal comparisons were also made on particulate material using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and elemental dispersive x-ray (EDX) analysis. Frontal waters were milky white-green in colour, in stark contrast to the adjacent clearer, green-blue waters. The milky white-green water (MW-GW) was found to be warmer, (apparently) less saline, more turbid, richer in nitrate and silicate and had a higher chlorophyll a concentration. The dissolved oxygen signal was less pronounced, both water types being supersaturated. Paradoxically, in spite of the higher turbidity in the MW-GW, both water types had similar weights of suspended solids, although the MW-GW material was found to be more abundant and fragmentary when compared with its green-blue water (G-BW) counterpart. The MW-GW was rich in calcium whereas the G-BW was silicon enriched. The central findings of this study are that the strong southerly, onshore wind conditions prior to MW-GW formation introduced calcium-rich, fine particulates into the waters of the surf-zone. The sources of these particulates are thought to be the <b>sea</b> <b>bed</b> <b>sediments</b> and the sea/land interface. The particulates are close to neutral buoyancy enabling the MW-GW to persist over the time-scale of days. A mechanism reinforced by the warming of this water in the nearshore zone. The water was then advected by windforcing and subsequently, its own inertia around the north-west corner of False Bay, at which stage it was easily observed and sampled. It is suggested that the eventual collapse of the front was due to the slowing down of inertial movement in combination with the passive sinking of fine particulates and evaporative cooling resulting in downward convection...|$|R

40|$|A fully {{three-dimensional}} {{model for the}} generation and evolution of tidal sand waves and sand banks from bottom perturbations of a flat seabed subject to tidal currents is proposed. The basic flow, comprehensive of Coriolis effects, is completely resolved in the vertical direction from the <b>sea</b> <b>bed</b> up to the free surface and describes both clockwise and counter-clockwise rotating tidal ellipses. The flow regime {{is assumed to be}} turbulent and a Boussinesq's approach is adopted to model Reynolds stresses.

Sediment transport is modelled in terms of both suspended load and bed load. The model is capable of predicting the conditions leading to the appearence of both tidal sand waves and tidal sand banks and to determine their main geometrical characteristics. As shown by previous works on the subject, the sand wave crests turn out to be orthogonal to the direction of the main tidal current and the sand bank crests are almost aligned with the main tidal current forming a small angle. While previous works always predict a counter-clockwise rotation, present results show that sand banks crests are clockwise or counter-clockwise rotated in comparison with the direction of the tidal current depending on the tide rotation.

40|$|Five {{artificial}} reef {{sites in the}} vicinity of Tanegashima were investigated through underwater observation, as to the degree of shoaling, scouring, general condition, and fish gathering patterns. These reefs were located in relatively shallow sandy bottom areas, at depths from 12 - 28 m. The reefs are generally of a single layer construction, with the blocks concentrated into an area with a maximum height of only 3 m. The shallow reefs are generally subject to shoaling effects. Regions with <b>sea</b> <b>beds</b> showing <b>sediment</b> transport ripples have the highest shoaling effect. A maximum shoaling rate of 8 - 9 cm/year was calculated for the reefs. Due to the shallow nature of these reefs, schools of the following larval fishes were observed {{in the shadow of the}} reefs: Spratelloides japonicus (banded blue sprat), Apogon semilineatus (bottom perch), Trachurus japonicus (Japanese horse mackerel), Scomber japonicus (mackerel), and Lutjanus vitta (brown striped snapper). Larger fish included Oplegnathus fasciatus (striped beak-perch), Plectorhynchus pictus (painted sweetlip), and Prionurus microlepidotus (surgeon fish), but in limited numbers.

40|$|The {{results of}} a fully {{three-dimensional}} model for the generation of tidal sand banks are discussed. The model {{is based on the}} linear stability analysis of the flat <b>sea</b> <b>bed</b> configuration subject to oscillatory tidal currents. The flow regime is assumed to be turbulent and a Boussinesq's approach is adopted to model Reynolds stresses. The eddy viscosity depends on the distance from the bed and an accurate description of the flow close to the <b>sea</b> <b>bed,</b> where <b>sediment</b> motion is mainly confined, is obtained. Sediment transport is modelled in terms of both suspended and bed loads. As discussed in Besio et al. (2004), where model predictions are compared with field data, the model can reliably predict the conditions leading to the appearance of tidal sand banks. Presently, attention is focussed on the prediction of the geometrical characteristics of sand banks. While previous works on the subject always predict sand banks with crests counter-clockwise rotated with respect to the direction of the main tidal current, the present results show that sand bank crests are clockwise/counter-clockwise rotated depending on the counter-clockwise/clockwise rotation of the velocity vector induced by the tide. Only when the tidal current tends to be unidirectional, sand banks are always characterized by crests which are counter-clockwise rotated with respect to the direction of the tidal current. Moreover, no preferred direction is selected by the analysis when the tide tends to be circular. The geometrical characteristics of sand banks (wavelength and angle of rotation) are computed as function of the ratio between the minor and major axes of the tidal ellipse for both clockwise and counter-clockwise rotating tidal velocity vectors...|$|R

The continental slope is incised by canyons heading to shelf edge sills and bounding sedimentary ridges of Miocene age. Dense shelf water forms in coastal polynya and is exported off the shelf break to form the AdÃ©lie Land branch of the Antarctic Bottom Water (ALBW, Rintoul et al., 2008). This bottom water is detected by CTD and mooring measurements up to about 3200 m of depth, in the Jussieu canyon and further to the west. The speed of the ALBW is enough to transport fine sand and silt from shallow to deep water as documented by <b>sea</b> <b>bed</b> <b>sediments.</b> Similar bottom currents activity is recorded also during Quaternary glacial and interglacials (Caburlotto et al., 2009, MacrÃ¬ et al., 2005) with source in the George V Land rocks and in the continental shelf (Damiani et al., 2006). The meandering charater of the Jussieu canyon and the sediment wave field on its eastern ridge, would suggest that they likely formed under the action of downslope, continous, bottom current, since the early Pliocene (Escutia et al., 2010).

Lake <b>bed</b> <b>sediments</b> were enriched in TP (median = 2, 661 mg kgâˆ’ 1) with relatively low Fe:P and Al:P mass ratios. Sequential extraction of three PP fractions showed that the mean proportion of HCl-extracted P (Ca-bound, denoting the refractory fraction) in extracted P was higher in terrestrial sediments (17 %) than stream <b>bed</b> <b>sediments</b> (4 %). Accordingly, TP concentrations of terrestrial sediments were highly (p < 0. 01) correlated with Ca (R = 0. 89), whereas TP was most closely correlated with Al (R = 0. 83) in the stream <b>bed</b> <b>sediments.</b> Nonetheless, the majority of sequentially extracted P in both terrestrial and stream <b>bed</b> <b>sediments</b> comprised fractions (bicarbonate dithionate- and NaOH-extractable) that are potentially bioavailable in Lake Rotorua.

40|$|The Equilibrium Phosphorus Concentration (EPC 0) {{of river}} <b>bed</b> <b>sediments</b> has been {{measured}} {{for a wide}} range of agricultural subcatchments and main river sites across two major eutrophic river basins: the Hampshire Avon and Herefordshire Wye catchments, to examine whether <b>bed</b> <b>sediments</b> are acting as sources or sinks of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) under low flows and times of greatest eutrophication risk. A conceptual reach-based model of interactions between <b>bed</b> <b>sediment</b> and river water has been used to estimate relative differences in bed-sediment SRP flux transfers. In this model, processes of SRP uptake and release are assumed to occur within an operationally defined 0. 1 m river water â€˜boundary layerâ€™ and the uptake and release of SRP is assumed to be driven by a differential between the EPC 0 of the sediment and SRP concentration in the boundary layer. Most of the river monitoring sites in the Wye and Avon catchments had elevated SRP and boron (B) concentrations in the water column at low flows, linked to sewage effluent discharges. At these sites, <b>bed</b> <b>sediments</b> consistently acted as net sinks for SRP, demonstrating the role of <b>bed</b> <b>sediments</b> in riverine â€˜self-cleansingâ€™ mechanisms. In contrast, <b>bed</b> <b>sediments</b> were found to act as net sources of SRP under three circumstances: (i) where there was minimal sewage influence (in headwater streams of the Avon), (ii) where sewage inputs were subject to large hydrological dilution by water of low SRP concentration (in the main River Wye), (iii) where EPC 0 values were relatively high, as a result of deposition of particulates with high exchangeable P concentrations from diffuse sources or from effluents (immediately downstream of sewage treatment works (STWs)). Under baseflow conditions, high SRP concentrations from sewage effluent in the tributaries appear to â€˜swamp outâ€™ any potential release of SRP from the <b>bed</b> <b>sediments.</b> For rivers that are subject to effluent P-stripping, reductions in SRP in the overlying water could potentially result in changes to the in-stream P-cycling mechanisms, with <b>bed</b> <b>sediments</b> possibly switching from net sinks to net sources of SRP.

Here we review state-of-the-art Eulerian implementations of bottom-up sediment transport and morphological change in coastal ocean hydrodynamic models. In order to investigate the fate of suspended sediment in coastal and estuarine waters {{as well as the}} evolution of <b>sea</b> or river <b>beds,</b> <b>sediment</b> dynamics need to be represented at a scale relevant to the numerical discretized solution, and significant effort is devoted to parameterize sediment processes. We discuss boundary layer hydrodynamics and the computation of the bed shear stress. We also focus on approaches used to represent near-bed processes such as bed load transport and sediment erosion and deposition. Sediment diffusivities, settling velocities, and cohesive processes such as flocculation all have an impact on suspended sediment throughout the water column. We then describe the implementation of process parameterizations in coastal hydrodynamic models, explicitly reviewing five widely used systems. The approaches implemented in these coastal models may present distinct strengths and shortcomings with regard to some important issues for coastal zones, both numerical and physical. While these detailed limitations need to be considered as part of model assessment, more general issues also hinder present state-of-the-art models. In particular, sediment transport is inherently highly empirical, which is further compounded by issues arising from turbulence closure schemes. We conclude by suggesting some possible directions toward improving sediment dynamics understanding and coastal-scale predictive abilit...|$|R

Filtration rates of â€˜reef oystersâ€™ (oysters on elevated reefs) were significantly higher than â€˜sea bed oystersâ€™ (oysters held on the <b>sea</b> <b>bed).</b> Respiration rates varied among months but were not significantly affected by elevation (reef/sea bed). Elevation and month also affected the total number of haemocytes and the granulocyte population; reef oysters had significantly higher numbers of haemocytes than <b>sea</b> <b>bed</b> oysters. As current stocks of European flat oysters (O. edulis) in Europe have declined in both abundance and distribution, the results of this pilot study suggest that the culture of oysters on elevated reef structure represents at least a partial solution to improve O. edulis physiology for restoration in Europe...|$|R
40|$|Seagrasses {{are highly}} {{productive}} and dynamic ecosystems, which supply {{a range of}} ecosystem services. Despite this, seagrass communities are globally in decline, largely due to anthropogenic influences. Urban and agricultural development, coupled with poor land management practices, can result in increased pollutants entering estuaries. <b>Sediments</b> below seagrass <b>beds</b> have been relatively well established as nutrient sinks. However, few studies have looked specifically at the concentration of heavy metals in seagrass <b>bed</b> <b>sediment</b> compared with adjacent bare sediment. This paper presents some preliminary findings for looking into the relationship of heavy metals in seagrass <b>bed</b> <b>sediment</b> compared with adjacent bare sediment within a temperate estuary of eastern Australia. Of the metals and elements tested, aluminium, barium, calcium, chromium, copper, iron, potassium, magnesium, manganese, sulphur and strontium were found in significantly higher concentrations within seagrass <b>bed</b> <b>sediments</b> compared to adjacent bare sediment...|$|R
40|$|The {{exposure}} of heavy metals to lake <b>bed</b> <b>sediment</b> of scenic areas may pose risks on aquatic ecosystems and human health, however very few studies on risk assessment {{have been reported}} for scenic areas. Accordingly, this study determined concentration levels, and assessed contamination characteristics and risks, of heavy metals in lake <b>bed</b> <b>sediment</b> of National Scenic Areas Songhuahu (NSAS) in China. The concentrations of Zn, Cr, Pb, Ni, and Cu were determined in 29 <b>bed</b> <b>sediment</b> samples. Results showed that the mean values of Zn, Cr, Pb, Ni, and Cu were 92. 69, 90. 73, 38. 29, 46. 77, and 49. 44 mg/kg, respectively. Pearson correlation coefficients indicated that organic matter was a major factor influencing distribution of heavy metals. The results for enrichment factors indicated that contamination rates and anthropogenic inputs of single heavy metals decreased in the order Cu > Ni > Pb > Cr > Zn; results of Nemerow integrated pollution index suggested that 72. 41 % of sampling sites were exposed to low to moderately integrated pollution, and 27. 59 % of sampling sites were exposed to strongly integrated pollution. According to results for potential ecological risk index, ecological risks of single and all the heavy metals in <b>bed</b> <b>sediment</b> from all the sampling sites were low. Human risks were assessed with hazardous quotients, and the results suggested that {{exposure of}} heavy metals to <b>bed</b> <b>sediment</b> posed no or little risk to human health, and the pathway of ingestion significantly contributed to human health risks...|$|R

The SAV model has direct linkages with the water quality model, including (1) {{a link between the}} growth and decay of SAV and the nutrient pool of the water quality model; (2) a link between the photosynthesis and respiration of SAV and dissolved oxygen dynamics, and (3) the ways in which settling of particulate organic matter and nutrient uptake affect nutrient levels in the water column and in the <b>sediment</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|R
40|$|This work {{examines}} baseflow nutrient concentrations {{and loads}} along two rural Chalk streams, the Pang and Lambourn. Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and boron (B) concentrations in these streams were {{heavily influenced by}} point-source inputs {{and the effects of}} downstream flow accretion and dilution. Unlike B (which is chemically conservative), SRP loads were also strongly influenced by in-stream processing resulting in uptake of SRP, particularly immediately downstream of sewage effluent discharges, where rates of SRP uptake were highest. For the upper River Pang, up to 80 % of SRP loads were lost within 4 km downstream of Compton sewage treatment works (STW) and on the River Lambourn up to 55 % of SRP loads were lost within 1. 6 km downstream of East Shefford STW. In contrast, nitrate (NO 3) concentrations at sites along the Pang and Lambourn were largely controlled by groundwater inputs and plant uptake during periods of high photosynthetic activity in spring and summer and silicon (Si) by diatom uptake in April/May. There were net gains in NO 3 loads along the river reaches, as a result of volumetric increases in groundwater discharge, and, compared with SRP, the role of in-stream processing of NO 3 appeared low. Examination of SRP exchange by <b>bed</b> <b>sediment</b> and uptake of SRP into algal biofilms indicated that biofilms accounted for only {{a very small percentage of}} in-stream P-uptake, but that <b>bed</b> <b>sediment</b> SRP-exchanges had a more important control on baseflow SRP concentrations and loads. Point source P remediation at East Shefford STW, by removal of P from final effluent (P-stripping), resulted in 70 â€“ 90 % reductions in river-water SRP loads. After introduction of P-stripping at East Shefford STW, <b>bed</b> <b>sediments</b> immediately downstream of the STW switched from being net sinks to net sources of SRP. Our results show that, in the immediate aftermath of P-stripping, <b>bed</b> <b>sediment</b> SRP-release was responsible for a 30 Î¼g-P lâˆ’ 1 rise in river-water SRP along this reach. While this increase in SRP concentration, as a result of <b>bed</b> <b>sediment</b> SRP release, is potentially ecologically significant, it is small in relation to the increase in SRP concentrations from effluent prior to P-stripping, which resulted in increases in SRP concentration of up to 500 Î¼g-P lâˆ’ 1. There was a six-month lag between the introduction of P-stripping at East Shefford STW and <b>bed</b> <b>sediment</b> EPC 0 recovering to equilibrium levels with the overlying river water (and thus negligible SRP release). Recovery of <b>bed</b> <b>sediments</b> to equilibrium levels is likely to have occurred as a result of winnowing and removal of high-EPC 0 sediment and delivery of lower EPC 0 sediment from upstream. Under higher/more variable flow conditions and greater rates of in-channel sediment erosion/delivery, more rapid recovery of <b>bed</b> <b>sediment</b> EPC 0 levels following P-stripping might be expected...|$|R
