5000|$|This variety was {{developed}} to provide a source of edible linseed oil with a low alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) content of approximately 2%, as compared to 50% in the wild type variety. [...] It was done to improve the <b>storage</b> <b>quality</b> of linseed when used as a bulk livestock feed. Linseed's previous main use had been linseed oil {{for use as a}} paint ingredient, with the ALA (omega-3 fatty acid) being a quick drying component. With the advent of [...] "plastic" [...] water-based paints, the linseed market fell into decline, but when marketed as a stock feed, the omega-3 content also deteriorated quickly in storage. It also has a correspondingly higher content of the linoleic acid, omega-6 fatty acid, around 65% to 75%. The lower level of ALA increases the oxidative stability of the oil/seed, which makes remain edible when stored. The seed colour was also changed from the wild type dark brown seed to a light yellow seed, which consequently gives an oil of a light colour, easily distinguished from the darker linseed oil, the flaxseed oil that we consume today. Linola oil does not contain any useful omega-3 fatty acids, and {{is not likely to be}} found as a human food/health supplement.Linola can specially help against neurodermatitis. Linola is being produced in Australia, Canada, the U.K. and in the U.S. states of Washington and Idaho. Linola substitutes for flax in cropping rotations; it is claimed to have lower production costs than canola, but brings prices comparable to canola or other edible oils. Linola is Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration.|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} {{conclusions from}} experiments can be mentioned. True pathogenous fungi and bacteria are {{of minor importance}} in storage. Clamp rot consists mainly of infection by secondary fungi and bacteria. The resistance of beets to these fungi depends on storage condition and on conditions during growth. Temperature and humidity are of importance during the storage of beets. If the temperature is below - 3 °C, beets freeze; if it is too high, respiratory losses are high and the beets soon start rotting. Beets dessicate easily and the <b>storage</b> <b>quality</b> of dessicated beets is poor. Harvesting and cultural methods should be directed to the storage of well ripened, healthy and undamaged beets in the clamp. Beet rot usually begins at damaged places, therefore deep topping, damaging and wounding of beets should be prevented. <b>Storage</b> <b>quality</b> is improved by early sowing and late harvesting. N, K, Mg and Na dressing showed a more distinct effect on the keeping qualities than on the beet yield. P and B dressings, however, {{did not affect the}} <b>storage</b> <b>quality.</b> On sandy soils in the Netherlands the <b>storage</b> <b>quality</b> and the yield may often be improved by rational fertilization...|$|E

The prediction accuracy of ANN was compared with that of multiple linear regression-based models.

Sodium acid sulfate (SAS) and UV-C treatments are regarded as effective methods for food preservation. In this study, the effects of SAS, UV-C treatment, and their combination on fresh-cut potatoes during storage were evaluated. Compared with the control, all of the treatments were effective in inhibiting the bacterial growth during the whole storage period.

40|$|Storability of {{onion is}} {{affected}} by timing of harvest. However, the optimal time for maximum yield and maximum storability do not necessarily coincide. This study aimed to determine the most suitable harvest time for obtaining a high bulb yield with high quality and storability. Storage experiments were conducted on onions produced in field experiments at a research field and on farms in four years. Results indicate that harvesting could be delayed to 100 % maturity, or even longer, without a marked increase in storage loss. In rainy years, late harvest is likely to impair the quality. The incidence of sprouting in shelf life tests varied considerably between years. An early harvest before 50 % maturity and a delayed harvest increased the risk of sprouting. It may be concluded that the harvesting of onions for long-term storage can be timed to take place between 50 % maturity and even some weeks after complete maturity without a loss in <b>storage</b> <b>quality.</b> Therefore, {{it is possible to}} combine high yield and good <b>storage</b> <b>quality...</b>|$|E

50|$|The germ of a cereal is the {{reproductive}} part that germinates {{to grow into}} a plant; it is the embryo of the seed. Along with bran, germ is often a by-product of the milling that produces refined grain products. Cereal grains and their components, such as wheat germ oil, rice bran oil, and maize, {{may be used as}} a source from which vegetable oil is extracted, or used directly as a food ingredient. The germ is retained {{as an integral part of}} whole-grain foods. Non-whole grain methods of milling are intended to isolate the endosperm, which is ground into flour, with removal of both the husk (bran) and the germ. Removal of bran is aimed at producing a flour with a white rather than a brown color, and eliminating fiber, which reduces nutrition. The germ is rich in polyunsaturated fats (which have a tendency to oxidize and become rancid on storage) and so germ removal improves the <b>storage</b> <b>qualities</b> of flour.|$|R
