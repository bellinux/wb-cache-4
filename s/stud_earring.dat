The singer seems morose and sad as she occasionally flickers her eyes to the ceiling and puts her head in her hands, showing off long manicured nails and a diamond <b>stud</b> <b>earring.</b> The low-key video also features Mikky Ekko, who performs his parts of the song separately including scenes of him {{perched on the edge of}} a different bathtub, gazing into a mirror, in front of an unlit fireplace, and sitting on a grand chair. The video switches between the pair throughout the course of the video until it concludes with a single tear falling from Rihanna's eye as she sinks lower into the bathtub.|$|E

2500|$|The main {{characteristic}} of stud earrings is {{the appearance of}} floating on the ear or earlobe without a visible (from the front) point of connection. [...] Studs are invariably constructed {{on the end of}} a post, which penetrates straight through the ear or earlobe. [...] The post is held in place by a removable friction back or clutch. [...] A <b>stud</b> <b>earring</b> features a gemstone or other ornament mounted on a narrow post that passes through a piercing in the ear or earlobe, and is held in place by a fixture on the other side. Studs commonly come in the form of solitaire diamonds. Some stud earrings are constructed so that the post is threaded, allowing a screw back to hold the earring in place securely, which is useful in preventing the loss of expensive earrings containing precious stones, or made of precious metals.|$|E

50|$|Tausug mananasal or blacksmiths produce bolo, kalis, and barong (bladed weapons). Fishing implem-ents {{are also}} made, {{such as the}} sangkil (single-po-inted spear) and the sapang (three-pronged spear). The more expensively {{fashioned}} blades have floral and geometric incisions; the ganja or metal strips which lock the handle and the blade are a decorative as well a functional device. Bronze casting is not as well developed {{as it is in}} Lanao. Among the several func-tional pieces produced were the batunjang (standing trays) and the talam (flat trays). Gold and silver-smithing for jewelry remain lucrative. Items produced by the local goldsmith include the singsing (ring), gallang (bracelet), gantung liug (necklace), bang (<b>stud</b> <b>earring),</b> aritis (dangling earring), pin (brooch), and gold teeth. In the past, tambuku (buttons) made of gold or silver decorated the traditional male and female costumes and were made with exquisite de-signs, often inlaid with palmata (semiprecious stones or gems). Among the favorite palmata are mussah (pearl), intan (diamond), kumalah (ruby) (Szanton 1973:47-51; Amilbangsa 1983:142-157).|$|E

Both girls chose earrings. The next venue was Curzon Hall for a romantic dinner but the atmosphere was awkward. Towards the end of the dinner, Tim took Laura out to the rotunda in the garden in hope of getting to know her better, but there was no spark and she again, didn't open up. After escorting her back and bringing Rochelle outside, Rochelle had an open heart discussion with Tim. Tim chose to eliminate Laura.

5000|$|New Mexican by birth, Coll {{began his}} career in Roswell wearing a crewcut that had become an unruly mop of grey {{by the time he}} {{returned}} to politics in Santa Fe. Also wearing glasses (and eventually hearing aids), Coll was broad-shouldered and stood just over 6' 2" [...] tall. After his return to New Mexico's House in the 1980s, he was usually seen wearing a <b>stud</b> <b>earring</b> in each ear, a turquoise watchband, and a brightly-colored vest on the Capitol Floor. (Although he also was famous for his impressive collection of bolo ties, Coll could only wear those to committee meetings, since bolos were outlawed by the Capitol's dress code until 2009, after he retired.) Despite his size and strong opinions, Coll was soft-spoken and known for a wry sense of humor. Among his colleagues, Coll gained a reputation for drawing caricatures depicting his viewpoint of their bills, arguments or behavior during legislative sessions and committee meetings. He would later present these to those colleagues, to be kept and cherished, at least by some. Coll also was known for his colorful expressions. In 1991, he responded to an interviewer's question, [...] "Is there a cheaper way to raise revenue other than the gross receipts tax?" [...] by saying, [...] "If frogs had wings, then they wouldn't bump their tails on the rocks." [...] In later years, Coll remembered his 1993 attempt to pass single-payer healthcare by saying, [...] "the insurance industry really came out of the woodwork and stomped on it like a June bug." [...] After crafting the state's 1997 budget proposal as chairman of the House Appropriations and Finance Committee under Governor Gary Johnson, Coll once stated, [...] "If you start with a sow's ear and you cut and stitch [...] [...] [...] you still end up with a sow's ear... It may not be a silk purse, but at least we turned it into a tube sock." [...] In 2000 when the state's Human Services Department [...] "found" [...] some funds where earlier they had reported a deficit, Coll compared the action to [...] "a blind pig's stumbling across an acorn." [...] During 2002 budget hearings, Coll hung a sign in front of his dias that read, [...] "What part of 'There is no money' do you not understand?" [...] Several years after retiring from politics, Coll was quoted as saying, [...] "I’d complain about getting old, but, you know, it doesn't do any good." [...] At Coll's memorial service, Barry Massey, a rafting companion of Coll's and an Associated Press reporter whose longtime beat is Santa Fe's Roundhouse, quoted something Coll had told him about rafting that, Massey said, also applies to life: [...] "In trying to pick a line of travel, Coll said, look where the current wants to take you {{and figure out how to}} make it better.” Of Coll, Massey also said, [...] "He lived as he rowed...He saw where the currents of life and politics wanted to pull and push him, and he figured out a way to make it better." ...|$|E

When he was 8, his father, aged 43, died in prison—which he was in for charges that included theft—due to liver failure and a ruptured esophagus, both caused by alcoholism. His mother died of an unknown illness when he was 16, and was unable {{to take care of her}} two children many years before that. To feel his mother's presence, he wears her <b>stud</b> <b>earrings.</b> His older brother, Marcus, by two-and-a-half years lives in San Antonio with his family, Avery Wallace, Valencya Ross, and Takisha Ross. Wallace stated: [...] "Going through so much at a young age, it seems like I can handle more difficult situations maybe easier than most people. I just kind of look at everything in a little bigger picture." [...] 49ers head coach Mike Nolan compared Wallace to former 49ers center Jeremy Newberry as [...] "a no-nonsense guy when it comes to football." ...|$|R

2500|$|Hoop {{earrings}} are circular or semi-circular in design, {{and look}} {{very similar to}} a ring. Hoop earrings generally {{come in the form}} of a hoop of metal that can be opened to pass through the ear piercing. They are often constructed of metal tubing, with a thin wire attachment penetrating the ear. [...] The hollow tubing is permanently attached to the wire at the front of the ear, and slips into the tube at the back. [...] The entire device is held together by tension between the wire and the tube. [...] Other hoop designs do not complete the circle, but penetrate through the ear in a post, using the same attachment techniques that apply to <b>stud</b> <b>earrings.</b> [...] A variation is the continuous hoop earring. [...] In this design, the earring is constructed of a continuous piece of solid metal, which penetrates through the ear and can be rotated almost 360°. [...] One of the ends is permanently attached to a small piece of metallic tubing or a hollow metallic bead. [...] The other end is inserted into the tubing or bead, and is held in place by tension. [...] One special type of hoop earring is the sleeper earring, a circular wire normally made of gold, with a diameter of approximately one centimeter. Hinged sleepers, which were common in Britain in the 1960s and 1970s, comprise two semi-circular gold wires connected via a tiny hinge at one end, and fastened via a small clasp at the other, to form a continuous hoop whose fastening mechanism is effectively invisible to the naked eye. Because their small size makes them unobtrusive and comfortable, and because they are normally otherwise unadorned, sleepers are so-called because they were intended to be worn at night to keep a pierced ear from closing, and were often the choice for the first set of earrings immediately following the ear piercing in the decades before ear-piercing guns using studs became commonplace, but are often a fashion choice in themselves because of their attractive simplicity and because they subtly call attention to the fact that the ear is pierced.|$|R

25|$|A long-standing home method {{involves}} using ice {{as a local}} anesthetic, {{a sewing}} needle as a puncture instrument, a burning match and rubbing alcohol for disinfection, and a semi-soft object, such as a potato, cork, bar of soap or rubber eraser, as a push point. Sewing thread may be drawn through the piercing and tied, as a device for keeping the piercing open during the healing process. Alternatively, a gold <b>stud</b> or wire <b>earring</b> may be directly inserted into the fresh piercing as the initial retaining device. Home methods are often unsafe and risky due to issues of improper sterilization or placement.|$|R
5000|$|Cuéntame {{coincided with}} the 10 year celebration of Lucero's career, and also was the album {{designed}} to show her mature stage. Although Melody, the record label, refused to change the diminutive Lucerito to Lucero, for marketing reasons, Cuéntame is the last album that carried the diminutive, closing [...] "infant stage" [...] of her career; Lucero's following release, Con Mi Sentimiento (1990) was the first album to achieve this. The singer recorded the album from January to March 1989, in Madrid, Spain, and Bologna, Italy, places where shed {{had the opportunity to}} meet some European countries for the first time. Executive producer Miguel Blasco, was commissioned to create the new image for the singer, including art design, clothing and music. J.R. Florez and Loris Ceroni were responsible for selecting and composing all the music and lyrics of the album along with Gian Pierto Di Felisatti. Blasco's idea was to show Lucero as a much more mature singer and with a stronger image (Lucero appears in the front cover in black leather with <b>studs,</b> heavy <b>earrings</b> and curly hair).|$|R
