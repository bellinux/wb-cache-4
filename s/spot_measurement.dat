A method is described for selecting hourly radon concentrations that are least perturbed by land emissions and dilution by the free troposphere. The distribution of subsequent radon flux density estimates is representative of a large area of the Southern Ocean, an important fetch region for Southern Hemisphere climate and air pollution studies. The annual mean flux density (0. 27 mBq m 2 s 1) compares well with {{the mean of the}} limited number of <b>spot</b> <b>measurements</b> previously conducted in the Southern Ocean (0. 24 mBq m 2 s 1), and to some <b>spot</b> <b>measurements</b> made in other oceanic regions. However, a number of <b>spot</b> <b>measurements</b> in other oceanic regions, as well as most oceanic radon flux density values assumed for modelling studies and intercomparisons, are considerably lower than the mean reported here. The reported radon flux varies with seasons and, in summer, with latitude. It also shows a quadratic dependence on wind speed and significant wave height, as postulated and measured by others, which seems to support our assumption that the selected least perturbed radon concentrations were in equilibrium with the oceanic radon source. By comparing the least perturbed radon observations in 2002 2003 with corresponding ‘TransCom’ model intercomparison results, the best agreement is found when assuming a normally distributed radon flux density with s 0. 075 mBq m 2 s 1. © 2013, W.

40|$|The use of {{personal}} exposure meters (exposimeters) has been recommended for measuring personal exposure to radio frequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) from environmental far-field sources in everyday life. However, {{it is unclear}} to what extent exposimeter readings are affected by measurements taken when personal mobile and cordless phones are used. In addition, the use of exposimeters in large epidemiological studies is limited due to high costs and large effort for study participants. In the current analysis we aimed to investigate the impact {{of personal}} phone use on exposimeter readings and to evaluate different exposure assessment methods potentially useful in epidemiological studies. We collected personal exposimeter measurements during one week and diary data from 166 study participants. Moreover, we collected <b>spot</b> <b>measurements</b> in the participants' bedrooms and data on self-estimated exposure, assessed residential exposure to fixed site transmitters by calculating the geo-coded distance and mean RF-EMF from a geospatial propagation model, and developed an exposure prediction model based on the propagation model and exposure relevant behavior.

The Spearman correlation with personal exposure (without personal phone calls) was 0. 42 (95 %-CI: 0. 29 to 0. 55) for the <b>spot</b> <b>measurements,</b> - 0. 03 (95 %-CI: - 0. 18 to 0. 12) for the geo-coded distance, 0. 28 (95 %-CI: 0. 14 to 0. 42) for the geospatial propagation model, 0. 50 (95 %-CI: 0. 37 to 0. 61) for the full exposure prediction model and 0. 06 (95 %-CI: - 0. 10 to 0. 21) for self-estimated exposure.

30|$|Deformation measurement, {{especially}} three-dimensional (3 D) deformation measurement, {{is essential}} to the quantitative description of object change and the accurate determination of mechanical properties. Traditionally, deformation measurement is carried out by the use of displacement transducers, such as strain gauges [1]. However, displacement transducers suffer from the disadvantage of being a <b>spot</b> <b>measurement</b> technique, which leads to low spatial resolution and insufficient information for full-field deformation measurement. Optical techniques such as digital speckle pattern interferometry (DSPI) [2, 3], digital image correlation [4], and Moiré method [5] have become preponderant methods in the measurement of deformation for objects with rough surfaces due to their full-field, stand-off, and non-contact measurement nature. Moreover, optical methods, particularly DSPI, are also very precise tools. DSPI is mainly divided, based on their optical setups and interferometric phase extraction methods, into two categories: phase-shifting DSPI (PS-DSPI) and spatial-carrier DSPI (SC-DSPI). The SC-DSPI is also known as digital holographic interferometry [6, 7].|$|E

Several techniques exist such as the DGT method (Diffusive Gradient in Thin Film) which allows the measurement of the labile fraction of metal complexes.

The objective of this study, conducted by the Leesu in collaboration with Siaap, is to optimize and to validate a simple method for the determination of labile metal concentrations in aquatic systems. For this, we chose the use of chelating disks made of a polymer (polystyrene divinylbenzene) functionalized with imino-diacetic acid (IDA) which are chelating groups similar to those used by the DGT method. The originality here is to use these chelating groups in chelating disks which can be used just like ordinary filter discs. The filtered sample is introduced into the chelating disk, IDA groups retain labile metal by complexation. The concentration of "inert" metal is determined in the disk effluent and provides access to the concentration of labile forms by subtracting from total dissolved metal.

40|$|Spot {{measurements}} of methane emission rate (n = 18 700) by 24 Angus steers fed mixed rations from GrowSafe feeders were made over 3 - to 6 -min periods by a GreenFeed emission monitoring (GEM) unit. The data were analysed to estimate daily methane production (DMP; g/day) and derived methane yield (MY; g/kg dry matter intake (DMI)). A one-compartment dose model of spot emission rate v. {{time since the}} preceding meal was compared with the models of Wood (1967) and Dijkstra et al. (1997) and the average of spot measures. Fitted values for DMP were calculated from the area under the curves. Two methods of relating methane and feed intakes were then studied: the classical calculation of MY as DMP/DMI (kg/day); and a novel method of estimating DMP from time and size of preceding meals using either the data for only the two meals preceding a <b>spot</b> <b>measurement,</b> or all meals for 3 days prior. Two approaches were also used to estimate DMP from spot measurements: fitting of splines on a 'per-animal per-day' basis and an alternate approach of modelling DMP after each feed event by least squares (using Solver), summing (for each animal) the contributions from each feed event by best-fitting a one-compartment model. Time since the preceding meal was of limited value in estimating DMP. Even when the meal sizes and time intervals between a <b>spot</b> <b>measurement</b> and all feeding events in the previous 72 h were assessed, only 16. 9 % {{of the variance in}} spot emission rate measured by GEM was explained by this feeding information. While using the preceding meal alone gave a biased (underestimate) of DMP, allowing for a longer feed history removed this bias. A power analysis taking into account the sources of variation in DMP indicated that to obtain an estimate of DMP with a 95 % confidence interval within 5 % of the observed 64 days mean of spot measures would require 40 animals measured over 45 days (two spot measurements per day) or 30 animals measured over 55 days.
