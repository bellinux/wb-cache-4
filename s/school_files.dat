5000|$|An {{example of}} [...] "in-camera review" [...] by the court: a {{defendant}} prosecuted for the alleged {{murder of a}} high school student asserts his was an act of self-defense, a last resort after the deceased physically assaulted the defendant.

The defendant seeks to obtain the deceased's high <b>school</b> <b>files</b> to see if there's anything proving the deceased fighting at school. A party for the deceased's family might argue against disclosure on the basis that school records which are presumably private should not be provided to the defendant. While a judge might acknowledge the general presumption, the court might permit the defendant limited use at trial any school records that may establish the deceased's physically aggressive tendencies.|$|E

40|$|In most Western {{developed}} countries, {{adult life}} is increasingly organized {{on the basis}} of short-term work contracts and reduced social security funds. In this context it seems that producing efficient job-seekers and employees becomes the main aim of educational programs for the next generation. Through case studies of young people from urban and countryside marginalized populations in Germany, USA and Brazil, this book investigates emerging educational practices and takes a critical stance towards what can be seen as neoliberal educational politics. It investigates how mediating devices such as CVs, school reports, <b>school</b> <b>files,</b> photos and narratives shape the ways in which those marginalized students reflect about their past as well as imagine their future. By building on process philosophy and time theory, post-structuralism, as well as on Vygotsky's psychological theory, the analysis differentiates between two discrete modes of human development: development of concrete skills (potential development) and development of new societal relations (virtual development, which {{is at the same time}} individual and collective). The book outlines an innovative relational account of learning and human development which can prove of particular importance for the education of marginalized students in today's globalized world...|$|E
40|$|Students with {{emotional}} impairments exhibit {{a wide range}} of academic and behavioral difficulties within school settings. Academically, this group of students holds low grade point averages, have higher rates of academic failure, progress at slower rates, and often do not graduate from high school. Behaviorally, these students make classroom instruction difficult, often causing teachers to focus on behavioral management for these students rather than on academic successes. Within the participating school district, students with disabilities obtained much lower standardized test scores than their same grade peers. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate reading instruction for students with or at-risk for emotional impairments across three middle schools, 6 th through 8 th grades. Five students and seven middle school language arts and/or reading teachers participated. The seven teachers had at least one participating subject in a language arts, reading, or READ 180 class in one or more middle school grades.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} ways in which the work of women {{teachers}} in primary schools in one region of Brazil has been re-defined by agents within the school itself. The investigation was pursued through semi-structured interviews with 48 women teachers and 14 school managers working mainly in poor communities. It reflects the experiences of teachers from Municipal schools in one of the developed cities: Belo Horizonte. Informal talks with teachers involved in activities outside classroom, other school staff such as secretaries and door-keepers, and parents encountered at the school entrance (some parents agreed to participate in tape-recorded interviews) also provided useful information for the study. Among the secondary• material collected during the field work were visual and written didactic texts used inside schools, the <b>school</b> <b>files</b> relating to discipline problems between pupils/parents and teachers, and the <b>school</b> <b>files</b> of "Colegiado" meetings. Also inside schools, observations were made of school meetings with parents; pedagogical meetings and a extraschool activities such as paren& and pupils' preparation for a party and showing of a school video. A search of written material from local newspapers archived by the Teachers' Union related to teachers was conducted. Visits to, and contacts with, the Municipal Secretary of Education provided material on extra-school administration. Study at the local University, with its extensive archive of recent studies on the history and conditions of work of women teachers in Brazil, in the State of Minas Gerais and specifically in the Municipal schools of Belo Horizonte,was a rich source of academic material for this study. It is suggested that the domestication of teachers' roles has been promoted within schools by teachers, the school managers and others involved in school life (parents, pupils and other school staff). This has led to a considerable increase in the number of roles schools and teachers are required to fulfil in communities with serious economic and social limitations. In a society where state social support is insufficient, schools provide palliative solutions for a range of needs. However, as schools become increasingly involved in business other than formal education, teachers' roles have changed and thus are judged through a gendered filter iii which stresses femininity over professionalism. Women's acceptance of poor working conditions and their involvement in the immediate social problems of pupils and local communities has been beneficial for the Brazilian and State governments, as well as for the local community. However, there have been negative consequences for the development of better ways to teach children from these communities and the status and socio-economic position of teachers themselves. The domestication of the roles of women in teaching has thus had long-term negative consequences for the education of the poor. ...|$|E
