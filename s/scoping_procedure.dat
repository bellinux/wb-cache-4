40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedA major budget reform proposal {{that is being}} studied, and has been implemented within the Department of Defense (DoD) is biennial budgeting. The Fiscal Year (FY) 1986 Defense Authorization Act directed DoD to submit two-year defense budgets beginning in FY 1988. Although relatively a new development for the federal government, many states have used biennial budgeting for years. Although budget size, <b>scope,</b> <b>procedure,</b> and form vary among states and between {{states and the federal}} government, certain successful attributes of biennial budgeting at the state level may be applied to biennial budgeting at the federal level. The purpose of this thesis is to provide an overview and analysis of biennial budgeting within DoD and the federal government. This study examines the effects of biennial budgeting on the Department of the Navy's budget planning and implementation process and Program Objectives Memorandum development. The realized benefits and limitations of biennial budgeting since DoD became the first federal agency to prepare two-year budgets are also explored. Biennial budgeting at the federal and state levels are compared, including a discussion of relevant attributes of state biennial budgeting experiences that may be applied to the federal budget process.

40|$|Linear endosonography, {{including}} intrathoracic lymph nodal sampling by endobronchial ultrasound with transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) and endoesophageal ultrasound fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA), has {{an important}} role in the diagnosing and staging of lung cancer. Furthermore, endosonography is applied in the mediastinal evaluation of sarcoidosis, lymphoma, cysts, and nodal metastases of extrathoracic malignancies. Endosonography-related complications as well as sedation and training strategies are discussed. The purpose of this review is to summarize current practice, recent advances, and future directions. Lung cancer guidelines recommend endosonography - above mediastinoscopy - as the initial test for mediastinal nodal tissue staging. By introducing the EBUS-scope into the esophagus (EUS-B) - following an EBUS procedure - the complete mediastinum and the left adrenal gland can be investigated in a single <b>scope</b> <b>procedure</b> by one operator. In patients with suspected stage I/II sarcoidosis, EBUS-TBNA/EUS-FNA is the test with the highest granuloma detection rate. Diagnosing (recurrent) lymphoma is an increasingly accepted indication for endosonography. Systematic surveys showed that endosonography has a low complication rate. Simulator-based training and assessment tools measuring competency are important instruments to provide standardized and optimal implementation. Endosonography is generally accepted as a powerful and safe diagnostic test for various diseases affecting the mediastinum. Large-scale implementation is neede...|$|R
