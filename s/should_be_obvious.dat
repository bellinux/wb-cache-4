25|$|As {{a member}} of the {{academic}} and scientific community, Knuth is strongly opposed to the policy of granting software patents for trivial solutions that <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>obvious,</b> but has expressed more nuanced views for nontrivial solutions such as the integer point method of linear programming. He has expressed his disagreement directly to both the United States Patent and Trademark Office and European Patent Organisation.|$|E

25|$|Most {{promoting}} pieces {{promote to}} a piece {{that exists in the}} initial setup of the board. However, such a promoted piece cannot then promote a second time as its namesake does. For example, a lion promotes to a furious fiend. However, while an eastern barbarian promotes to a lion on its first capturing move, it does not further promote to a furious fiend on its second. Rather, it remains a lion {{for the rest of the}} game. This <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>obvious</b> from the game pieces, which only have two sides.|$|E
25|$|However, whilst the {{rationale}} behind the equation is sound, {{it is unlikely that}} the equation will be constrained to reasonable limits of error any time soon. The problem with the formula is that it is not usable to generate or support hypotheses because it contains factors that can never be verified. The first term, R*, number of stars, is generally constrained within a few orders of magnitude. The second and third terms, fp, stars with planets and fe, planets with habitable conditions, are being evaluated for the star's neighborhood. Drake originally formulated the equation merely as an agenda for discussion at the Green Bank conference, but some applications of the formula had been taken literally and related to simplistic or pseudoscientific arguments. Another associated topic is the Fermi paradox, which suggests that if intelligent life is common in the universe, then there <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>obvious</b> signs of it.|$|E
500|$|Como's {{comments}} {{during a}} 1949 interview were prophetic, {{as far as}} his success was concerned. At the time he was doing the Chesterfield Supper Club on both radio and television, [...] "Television is going to do me a lot more personal good than the movies ever have... The reason <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>obvious.</b> On television, I'm allowed to be myself; in pictures, I was always some other guy. I come over like just another bum in a tuxedo."

500|$|Tone clusters...on {{the piano}} [...] whole scales of tones used as chords, {{or at least}} three {{contiguous}} tones along a scale {{being used as a}} chord. And, at times, if these chords exceed the number of tones that you have fingers on your hand, {{it may be necessary to}} play these either with the flat of the hand or sometimes with the full forearm. This is not done from the standpoint of trying to devise a new piano technique, although it actually amounts to that, but rather because this is the only practicable method of playing such large chords. It <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>obvious</b> that these chords are exact and that one practices diligently in order to play them with the desired tone quality and to have them absolutely precise in nature.|$|E

2500|$|Mike Judge {{once said}} in an {{interview}} that Beavis [...] "is a zero" [...] when it comes to intelligence; indeed, Beavis is often oblivious to what <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>obvious.</b> Generally submissive to Butt-Head and willing to tolerate a large amount of physical and verbal abuse, Beavis nonetheless has limits. In [...] "Murder Site", Beavis was driven to attack and nearly kill Butt-Head, who ceaselessly called him [...] "Butt-knocker", a term which Beavis resents. Beavis also stood up to Butt-Head while they were watching the video for Rancid's [...] "Nihilism": Butt-Head kept talking about it derisively, prompting Beavis to tell Butt-Head to shut up. When Butt-Head reacted with fury, ordering Beavis never again to tell him to shut up and threatening to attack him, Beavis preemptively kicked Butt-Head in the testicles, told him to shut up again, and walked out of the room to get something to eat. In another episode, while the duo were watching a Bon Jovi video, Beavis claimed to like one part of the song, causing Butt-Head to slap him in disgust. After being struck a few times, Beavis kicked Butt-Head in the groin and proclaimed [...] "Bon Jovi rules!".|$|E
2500|$|Anneliese van der Pol portrayed Chelsea Daniels, Aged 14–17. Often {{referred}} to as Chels, She is Raven's female best friend. She is an environmentalist, vegetarian, and closet artist. She is portrayed as being clumsy and dimwitted (although the first two seasons portray her {{to be just as}} smart as Raven, but to extreme limits); at times, her stupidity is so potent that she is frequently oblivious to what <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>obvious</b> and unable to discern sarcasm from sincerity. She usually uses the catchphrases [...] "That makes more sense!" [...] or '"This is awkward!" [...] She also likes to make jokes, which only she would laugh at. Despite her apparent lack of common sense and intelligence, she has a few surprises up her sleeve—such as occasionally knowing certain [...] "smart" [...] things, which usually tends to surprise everyone else. In Season 1, it is revealed that Raven and Chelsea's friendship goes {{all the way back to}} when they were in pre-school, but she was also shown to be dimwitted back then because she did not notice Raven blowing out the candles on her birthday cake. It should also be noted that Chelsea was just as caring when she was young as she is now because one of her unfulfilled wishes on that same birthday was to stop global warming. She is quite similar to Newt (from Cory in the House) in personality. She is very passionate in saving the environment and caring for the animals, and also much more spiritual compared to Raven who can be materialistic, though it occasionally leads to troubling events like the three friends disputing over a goat and nearly turning herself and Raven into cows. In earlier episodes, Cory has a huge crush on her and unsuccessfully pursues her. Occasionally, Chelsea refers to a specific relative, Cousin Earl, at times. Her parents are Therapists. She also has a dog named Sam. Chelsea is present in every episode except Mother Dearest, Smell of Victory, and Saturday Afternoon Fever.|$|E
30|$|The {{correct answer}} is the option “beyond measurement”, which <b>should</b> <b>be</b> pretty <b>obvious</b> since it even shares substrings with the target word “immeasurably”.

She could only confine herself to a simple vague statement. [...] "I can only say that from all I have seen and heard I have reasons for believing that Lord Harry is not dead at all." [...] She felt that this was a feeble way of summing up, but she was not at the moment equal to more. [...] "When I write again, after I have heard from you, I will tell you more. To-day I cannot. I am too much weighed down. I am afraid of saying too much. Besides, I have no money, and must look for work. I am not anxious, however, about my own future, because my lady will not forsake me. I am sure of that. It is my anxiety about her and the dreadful secrets I have learned which give me no rest." ...|$|E
