Both entrained and dissolved gases can be found from virtually all pulp flows, but fast and accurate inline measurement technique for gas content measurement has yet to been established. In these experiments new sonar technique for gas content measurement was tested. Experiments where done in pilot-scale pumping system where pulp suspension was circulated with centrifugal pump in closed loop. Measurements where located in the vertical outlet pipe of the pump. Air content of the system could be adjusted with two different principles. Macro bubbles (> 100 µm) were fed to the system through membrane tube controlling volumetric air flow with rotameters. Micro bubbles (= 20 - 100 µm) were created precipitating bubbles from dissolved form controlling the level of dissolved oxygen and volumetric flow of the supersaturated suspension. Measurement accuracy of the <b>sonar</b> <b>method</b> was tested with four different air content levels and two different bubble types. Furthermore the effect pulp grade, consistency, flow velocity and process pressure were tested. Microwave and radiometric methods were used as reference measurements.

40|$|Aim. We present {{materials}} {{on the history}} of hydroacoustic research in the Caspian Sea and forecast of catches in case of abolition of the law prohibiting the fishing in the open sea. Methods. We have carried out three hydroacoustic surveys in accordance with existing procedures. Investigations have been conducted using fish-finding multifunctional sonar panorama video-plotter. Results. Hydroacoustic researches on the density of accumulations, spatial distribution and stocks of Caspian Sea migrating herring (Dolginskaya herring, Caspian and bigeye shads) were carried out in the period of April - May 2007, in the shallow part of the North Caspian Sea, and for this we have performed two hydroacoustic surveys. In the spring, in different areas of surveyed area size and weight characteristics of marine migratory herrings were fairly stable; the length of Dolginskiy herring caught in control fixed nets {{in different parts of the}} area surveyed ranged from 23. 6 cm. to 30. 0 cm, with an average of 26, 7 cm; as for the weight, it fluctuated from 212. 3 g. to 393 g, with an average of 275. 0 g. These data indicate that the temperature factor is one of the most important abiotic factors that determine the density of accumulations, places and areas of migratory sea herring in the pre-spawning period. Conclusion. Using hydroacoustic <b>sonar</b> <b>method</b> in the Caspian Sea for more than 40 years has shown its representativeness and reliability in assessing marine fish stocks. The number of marine migratory herring in the North Caspian Sea is closely linked to the temperature of the water and with the increase in temperature we can observe increase in the number. The biomass of marine migratory herrings in the Northern Caspian Sea varies from 3 to 5 thousand tons, which is a significant reserve for the fishing industry of Kazakhstan and Russia. Under the current economic conditions the hydroacoustic <b>sonar</b> <b>method</b> is to become a major tool for assessment of fish stocks in the North Caspian. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{traditional}} active <b>sonar</b> processing <b>methods</b> to detect targets is often limited by clutter and reverberation from ocean environments. Similarly, multipath arrivals from radiating {{sources such as}} ships and submarines are received at sensors in passive sonar systems.

Most of the existing approaches to feature location from vision data have been developed by a combination of matching and geometric triangulation.

In contrast, our approach avoids the matching problem by looking for evidence of the location of features on an occupancy grid.

40|$|Abstract A pulp {{suspension}} {{consists of}} water, fibres, fines, fillers and chemicals, but air or other gases are {{also present in}} practically all pulping processes either in dissolved form or as bubbles. Dissolved gases seldom disturb the processes, but they are readily converted to gaseous form when conditions change. The gas bubbles affect {{the properties of the}} pulp suspension, reduce the accuracy of certain measurements, interfere with the runability of the papermachine and detract from the quality of the end-product. Gases are removed from the process by either mechanical or chemical means, resulting in increased investments and operational costs. The aim of this work was to study the behaviour of gas in pulp and papermaking processes with laboratory, pilot-scale and mill-scale experiments. Five main areas of the research can be identified: 1. Occurrence of gases in pulp and paper mill processes, 2. Dissolution, precipitation and hold-up of gases in the pulp suspension and mill water, 3. Effects of gases on certain consistency measurements, centrifugal pumping and operation of the hydrocyclone. 4. Measurement of the gas content of the pulp suspension by compression, radiometric, microwave and <b>sonar</b> <b>methods</b> and 5. Removal of gases with a centrifugal pump equipped with vacuum pump or hydrocyclone equipped light reject removal. The results show that the dissolution and precipitation of gas is strongly dependent on the pulp and water properties. Dissolved and colloidal material reduces the solubility potential of gas, but also accelerates the precipitation of dissolved gases in gaseous form. The hold-up of precipitated gas bubbles was found to be much more pronounced in hydrophobic mechanical pulps than in lignin-free chemical pulps. The accuracy of consistency measurements was affected by free gas in the pulp suspension, requiring special attention when assessing the results. The operation of pressure screens and hydrocyclones was affected only at high volumes of free gas in the feed suspension. According to the experiments, a reliable gas content measurement can be achieved by in-line radiometric, microwave or <b>sonar</b> <b>methods,</b> and also by the off-line compression method if a representative sample is obtained. A centrifugal pump equipped with a gas removing unit is designed mainly to ensure undisturbed pumping, whereas its gas removal efficiency remains quite low, especially with small bubbles and at a low gas content. The gas removal efficiency of a hydrocyclone equipped with light reject removal is good, but decreases with small precipitated bubbles. These results offer new information of the behaviour of the gas in pulp suspensions and white water and underline the importance of the bubble generation mechanism in this context...|$|R

40|$|Effective marine {{archaeological site}} {{management}} demands {{detailed information on}} not only the spatial distribution of artefacts but also the degradation state of the materials present. Although <b>sonar</b> <b>methods</b> have frequently been used {{in an attempt to}} detect buried wooden shipwrecks they are currently unable to indicate their degradation state. To assess the sensitivity of acoustic measurements to changes in the degradation state of such material, and hence the potential for sonars to quantify degradation, laboratory measurements of compressional wave velocity, as well as bulk density for oak and pine samples, in varying states of decay, were undertaken. These data enabled the calculation of theoretical reflection coefficients for such materials buried in various marine sediments. As wood degrades, the reflection coefficients become more negative, resulting in the hypothesis that the more degraded wood becomes, the easier it should be to detect. Typical reflection coefficients of the order of − 0. 43 and − 0. 52 for the most degraded oak and pine samples in sand are predicted. Conversely, for wood exposed to seawater the predicted reflection coefficients are large and positive for undegraded material (0. 35 for oak, 0. 18 for pine) and decrease to zero or slightly below for the most degraded samples. This indicates that exposed timbers, when heavily degraded, can be acoustically transparent and so undetectable by acoustic methods. Corroboration of these experimental results was provided through comparison with high resolution seismic reflection data that has been acquired over two shipwrecks...|$|R

Improvement of the resolution and ecological validity of seafloor habitat distribution models has, for the most part, paralleled developments in new generations of acoustic survey tools such as multibeam echosounders. While <b>sonar</b> <b>methods</b> have been well demonstrated to provide useful proxies of the relatively static geophysical patterns that reflect distribution of benthic species and assemblages, the spatially and temporally variable influence of hydrodynamic energy on habitat distribution have been less well studied. Here we investigate the role of wave exposure on patterns of distribution of near-shore benthic habitats. A high resolution spectral wave model was developed for a 624 km 2 site along Cape Otway, a major coastal feature of western Victoria, Australia. Comparison of habitat classifications implemented using the Random Forests algorithm established that significantly more accurate estimations of habitat distribution were obtained by including a fine-scale numerical wave model, extended to the seabed using linear wave theory, than by using depth and seafloor morphology information alone. Variable importance measures and map interpretation indicated that the spatial variation in wave induced bottom orbital velocity was most influential in discriminating habitat the classes containing canopy forming kelp Ecklonia radiata, a foundation kelp species that affects biodiversity and ecological functioning on shallow reefs across temperate Australasia. We demonstrate that hydrodynamic models reflecting key environmental drivers on wave exposed coastlines are important in accurately defining distributions of benthic habitats...|$|R

40|$|A cost {{effective}} approach to remote monitoring {{of protected areas}} such as marine reserves and restricted naval waters is to use passive sonar to detect, classify, localize, and track marine vessel activity (including small boats and autonomous underwater vehicles). Cepstral analysis of underwater acoustic data enables the time delay between the direct path arrival and the first multipath arrival to be measured, which in turn enables estimation of the instantaneous range of the source (a small boat). However, this conventional method is limited to ranges where the Lloyd's mirror effect (interference pattern formed between the direct and first multipath arrivals) is discernible.

A sonar system phase calibration method, which includes both the amplitude and phase response is proposed. The technique is an extension of the widespread standard-target <b>sonar</b> calibration <b>method,</b> based on the use of metallic spheres as standard targets. Frequency domain data processing is used, with target phase measured as a phase angle difference between two frequency components. This approach minimizes the impact of range uncertainties in the calibration process. Calibration accuracy is examined by comparison to theoretical full-wave modal solutions. The system complex response is obtained for an operating frequency of 50 to 150 kHz, and sources of ambiguity are examined. The calibrated broadband sonar system is then used to study the complex scattering of objects important for the modelling of marine organism echoes, such as elastic spheres, fluid-filled shells, cylinders and prolate spheroids.
