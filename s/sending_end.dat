500|$|At the <b>sending</b> <b>end</b> {{there were}} two rows of buttons, a pair of [...] buttons for each coil in each row. [...] The {{operator}} selected one button from each row. [...] This connected two of the coils to {{the positive and negative}} ends of the battery respectively. [...] The other ends of the coils were connected to the telegraph wires and thence to one end of the coils at the receiving station. [...] The other end of the receiving coils, while in receive mode, were all commoned together. [...] Thus the current flowed through the same two coils at both ends and energised the same two needles. [...] With this system the needles were always energised in pairs and always rotated in opposite directions.|$|E
500|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, it was acoustic resonance {{that inspired}} filtering applications, {{the first of}} these being a telegraph system known as the [...] "harmonic telegraph". Versions are due to Elisha Gray, Alexander Graham Bell (1870s), [...] and others. Its purpose was to simultaneously transmit a number of telegraph messages over the same line and represents an early form of frequency division multiplexing (FDM). FDM requires the <b>sending</b> <b>end</b> to be transmitting at different frequencies for each individual communication channel. This demands individual tuned resonators, as well as filters to separate out the signals at the receiving end. The harmonic telegraph achieved this with electromagnetically driven tuned reeds at the transmitting end which would vibrate similar reeds at the receiving end. Only the reed with the same resonant frequency as the transmitter would vibrate to any appreciable extent at the receiving end.|$|E

30|$|If {{the power}} flow is kept at one {{direction}} (e.g. {{from left to}} right) the requirement of DC voltage reversal is avoided. For this operating scenario, the AC/DC converters Cb-B 3 and Cb-B 4 are the rectifiers as power <b>sending</b> <b>ends,</b> and Cb-B 1 and Cb-B 2 are the inverters as power receiving ends. At the normal operating conditions, the power flows from AC system GE- 2 to AC system GE- 1 via the DC lines and associated AC lines.|$|R
50|$|Consider a {{networking}} {{application that}} tunnels {{data from a}} remote data source to a remote destination. The data being tunneled may consist of any bit patterns. The <b>sending</b> <b>end</b> of the tunnel may at times have conditions {{that it needs to}} notify the receiving end about. However, it cannot simply insert a message to the receiving end, because that end {{will not be able to}} distinguish the message from data sent by the data source. But using an out-of-band mechanism, the <b>sending</b> <b>end</b> can send the message to the receiving end out of band. The receiving end will be notified in some fashion of the arrival of out-of-band data, and it can read the out of band data and know that this is a message intended for it from the <b>sending</b> <b>end,</b> independent of the data from the data source.|$|E

50|$|SSI is a synchronous, {{point to}} point, serial {{communication}} channel for digital data transmission. Synchronous data transmission {{is one in}} which the data is transmitted by synchronizing the transmission at the receiving and <b>sending</b> <b>ends</b> using a common clock signal. Since start and stop bits are not present, this allows better use of data transmission bandwidth for more message bits and makes the whole transmission process simpler and easier. The clock needs its own bandwidth and should be included when determining the total bandwidth required for communication between the two devices.|$|R

5000|$|Shunt {{reactors}} {{are used}} in power systems to counteract {{the effect of the}} line parasitic capacitance, thereby stabilizing the system voltage within acceptable limits. For short lines, we can basically ignore the impact of capacitive current from a voltage regulation point of view, but medium and long lines can have voltages at their receiving end much higher than the <b>sending</b> <b>end,</b> thus creating issues such as over-fluxing of power transformers and over stressing of line insulators. Under light-load conditions, the line produces more VARs, resulting in receiving end voltage being higher than <b>sending</b> <b>end</b> voltage. In order to consume the excess VARs when system is lightly loaded, an inductor is added to the system. Since inductors absorbs VARs, a reactor is connected in parallel with shunt capacitance of the line known as Shunt Reactor, ...|$|E
50|$|The {{lossless}} line approximation is {{the least}} accurate model; it is often used on short lines when the inductance of the line {{is much greater than}} its resistance. For this approximation, the voltage and current are identical at the sending and receiving ends.The characteristic impedance is pure real, which means resistive for that impedance. And it is often called surge impedance for a lossless line. When lossless line is terminated by surge impedance, there is no voltage drop. Because though the phase angles of voltage and current are rotated, the magnitudes of voltage and current remain constant {{along the length of the}} line. For load > SIL, the voltage will drop from <b>sending</b> <b>end</b> and the line will “consume” VARs. For load < SIL, the voltage will increase from <b>sending</b> <b>end,</b> and the line will “generate” VARs.|$|E

50|$|End {{systems are}} usually {{connected}} {{to each other}} using switching devices known as routers rather than using single communication link. The path that transmitted information takes from the <b>sending</b> <b>end</b> system, {{through a series of}} communications links and routers, to the receiving end system is known as a route or path through the network.|$|E
50|$|A radiotelegraph simplex channel, {{operates}} {{by sending}} information {{in one direction}} only (e.g. a broadcast channel). A simplex channel may comprise only a transmitting station with only a transmitter and a transmit antenna on the <b>sending</b> <b>end</b> coupled with a receiving station comprising only a receive antenna and a receiver on the receiving end. Such simplex channels may be contrasted with duplex channels which have fully equipped stations on both ends and are capable of sending information in both directions.|$|E
50|$|In {{electrical}} engineering, the Ferranti {{effect is}} an increase in voltage occurring at the receiving end of a long transmission line, above the voltage at the <b>sending</b> <b>end.</b> This occurs when the line is energized, but there is a very light load or the load is disconnected. The capacitive line charging current produces a voltage drop across the line inductance that is in-phase with the sending-end voltage, assuming negligible line resistance. Therefore both line inductance and capacitance are responsible for this phenomenon.|$|E

5000|$|Telegraph networks, {{used from}} the 1850s to the 1920s to {{transmit}} text messages long distances, transmitted information by pulses of current {{of two different}} lengths, called [...] "dots" [...] and [...] "dashes" [...] which spelled out text messages in Morse code. A telegraph operator at the <b>sending</b> <b>end</b> of the line would create the message by tapping on a switch called a telegraph key, which rapidly connects and breaks the circuit to a battery, sending pulses of current down the line.|$|E
5000|$|By {{separating}} {{the functions of}} segmentation and reassembly from cell transport, AAL5 follows the layering principle. The ATM cell transfer layer is classified as [...] "machine-to-machine" [...] because the layering principle applies from one machine to the next (e.g., between a host and a switch or between two switches). The AAL5 layer is classified as [...] "end-to-end" [...] because the layering principle applies from the source to the destination - AAL5 presents the receiving software with data {{in exactly the same}} size blocks as the application passed to the AAL5 on the <b>sending</b> <b>end.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Shunt {{inductive}} compensation: This {{method is}} used either when charging the transmission line, or, {{when there is}} very low load at the receiving end. Due to very low, or no load - very low current flows through the transmission line. Shunt capacitance in the transmission line causes voltage amplification (Ferranti effect). The receiving end voltage may become double the <b>sending</b> <b>end</b> voltage (generally in case of very long transmission lines). To compensate, shunt inductors are connected across the transmission line. The power transfer capability is thereby increased depending upon the power equation ...|$|E

50|$|The {{side of the}} {{transformer}} {{facing the}} line, in a good quality design, will have the winding laid in two parts (often with a centre tap provided) which are carefully balanced to maintain the line balance. Line side and equipment side windings are more useful concepts than the more usual primary and secondary windings when discussing these kinds of transformers. At the <b>sending</b> <b>end</b> the line side winding is the secondary, but at the receiving end the line side winding is the primary. When discussing a two-wire circuit primary and secondary cease to have any meaning at all, since signals are flowing in both directions at once.|$|E
