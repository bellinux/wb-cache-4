50|$|In 2002, {{along with}} the Fort of Guia, the {{emplacement}} {{was included in the}} list of patrimony that was put up for sale, during the term of Manuel Ferreira Leite at the Ministry of Finances. Against this, the Minister of the Republic (for the Azores), Alberto Sampaio da Nóvoa, declared to the press his intention to ({{along with the}} Ministries of Defense and Finances) make sure the military installations did not become private property. The initial public offering at the time was 110,000 Euros (while the Fort of Guia was offered at 25,000 Euros). For Nóvoa (who considered both emplacements in good condition), the sites were of an important patrimonial nature and its use should have been negotiated between the <b>State,</b> <b>regional</b> <b>government</b> and municipal authority (to provide an adequate use). He argued that the emplacement should be transformed into a military museum, a suggestion that was manifested by the old Minister of Defense Júlio Castro Caldas (who served under António Guterres), when he visited Faial in 2000. The municipal council was also interested in acquiring the space, but thought that the initial base of 110,000 Euros was excessive.|$|E

They have better information on their tax bases than the federal government. We model this both as an adverse selection problem {{on the size of}} local tax bases and/or as moral hazard problem on local tax enforcement. Moral hazard alone does not affect the first best redistribution rule, which is a lump sum transfer from the rich to the poor region. In all other cases the optimal transfer rule involves a lump sum tax on the rich regions and a premium for fiscal effort by the poor regions, with the transfer falling short of the first-best level.

40|$|In Australia, {{the federal}} (central) and <b>State</b> (<b>regional)</b> <b>governments</b> share {{constitutional}} responsibility for aspects {{of science and}} innovation policy. In practice, {{the federal government has}} tended to overshadow the States both in funding and policy for research and innovation. It can be argued that we are now seeing the strong rebirth of regionalism (at least at the State level) as far as government support for science, technology and knowledge-based industries is concerned. The paper traces the growth of regional innovation policies through examples of initiatives from South Australia and other regions and examines the respective contributions of the State and federal governments. The character of State government support has evolved over the last 15 years, from sponsoring grand ‘technology citadels’ to today’s strategies that take a more bottom-up approach to building intense innovation environments, local clusters and knowledge hubs. Some of these trends reflect the influence of the global knowledge economy on regional industries, while others (notably the relative decline of the federal government as an R 2 ̆ 6 D performer) are peculiarities of the Australian innovation system. The outcome is a significant evolution in Australia’s innovation system, one which parallels responses to globalisation in other countries and suggests a different – but not diminished – role for public sector innovation policy...|$|R

40|$|As the {{teaching}} professions face rapidly changing demands, educators require an increasingly broad {{and more sophisticated}} set of competences than before. In particular the ubiquity of digital devices and the duty to help students become digitally competent requires educators {{to develop their own}} digital competence. On International and national level a number of frameworks, self-assessment tools and training programmes have been developed to describe the facets of digital competence for educators and to help them assess their competence, identify their training needs and offer targeted training. Analysing and clustering these instruments, this report presents a common European Framework for the Digital Competence of Educators (DigCompEdu). DigCompEdu is a scientifically sound background framework which helps to guide policy and can be directly adapted to implement regional and national tools and training programmes. In addition, it provides a common language and approach that will help the dialogue and exchange of best practices across borders. The DigCompEdu framework is directed towards educators at all levels of education, from early childhood to higher and adult education, including general and vocational training, special needs education, and non-formal learning contexts. It aims to provide a general reference frame for developers of Digital Competence models, i. e.
