40|$|Abstract: The glacigenic {{sequence}} on {{the continental}} shelf and shelf breakin the Barents Sea has been mapped seismostratigraphically. Four and six major units have been distinguished {{on the outer}} and inner shelf, respectively. The outer <b>shelf</b> <b>units</b> increase in thickness towards theshelf break, except for the youngest one. The geometry of these units is determined partly by the morphology ofthe basement (infill), but to a larger extent by postdepositional erosion. The older, inner <b>shelf</b> <b>units</b> are located in a coast parallel trough. The two youngest units al o have a blanketing character. The geometry of the younger units gives indications of source areas, s well as of ice movement direction of subsequent eroding ice sheets. The palaeoenvironment and palaeogeography during the mid-late Weichselian in the Barents Sea is reconstructed. Recently, Vorren et al. (1989) gave {{an account of the}} glacigenic sediments in the southern Barents Sea (Fig. 1). We distinguished three depositional systems, each having a distinct geometry and character: the continental s ope, the continental shelf and fjord systems. In this paper we will present some new data from the continental shelf system. The aim is: (1) to establish a seismostratigraphy for the glacigenic <b>units</b> on the <b>shelf,</b> (2) to explain the lateral relationship between units on the outer and inner shelf, (3) to explain the geometry and origin of the units, and (4) to reconstruct the palaeoenvironment and palaeoceanography during the mid/late Weichselian. In this study we have mainly used analogue as well as digital shallow-seismic data (Fig. 2). This includes high-resolution airgun data and sparker data.

40|$|A {{recently}} completed integrated stratigraphic {{study of the}} mixed sediments on the Caribbean side of the Isthmus of Panama (Limon, Costa Rica) has delineated two phases of reef proliferation that were controlled by changes in eustatic sea level. The older one, latest Early Pliocene, originated on siliciclastics of a prograded, shallow-marine <b>shelf</b> <b>unit</b> (Rio Banano Fm.), and corresponds with closure of the Central American isthmus. Although heavily stressed by siliciclastic input, the depositional conditions were supportive enough to stimulate origination of several modern reef-building corals. Most notably, the first occurrence of Acropora palmata is now placed significantly earlier at about approximately 3. 6 - 4. 0 Ma. The younger episode of reef development occurred around the Plio/Pleistocene boundary and is separated from the older reef unit by coarse-grained sands and gravel (Pueblo Nuevo Sands, Moin Fm.) associated with a marine regression. This younger reef sequence, also heavily sediment stressed, shows that most modern reef species were established by this time (1. 9 - 1. 6 Ma) and that accelerated extinction occurred between the two reef episodes. This sequence of reef development is coincident with several third-order sea level events, as recently documented from the Bahamas record. Relatively high sea levels in the Early Pliocene, a mid-Pliocene fall related to onset of northern hemisphere glaciation, and a highstand at the Plio/Pleistocene boundary are correlated respectively to the first reef phase, shallow marine sands, and the second reef event. Subsequent to the second reef phase, the Limon region was uplifted at least 50 m...|$|E
40|$|Cup-shaped {{depressions}} (termed buracas {{by local}} fishermen) are common geomorphic {{features on the}} northeastern Abrolhos Continental Shelf (Brazil). Samples collected by technical diving from the walls of two depressions (Buraca Funda, B 1, top at 59 m, and Buraca Rasa, B 2, top at 26 m) and seismic profiles provide evidence of the processes leading to their formation. The top of the sedimentary succession consists of two units bounded by erosion unconformities. Unit 1 overlies an erosion surface (MR 1) and is older than the radiocarbon dating limit. It {{is made up of}} packstone to rudstone accumulated on mid- to outer-shelf paleoenvironments. Voids in the limestone are filled by a meteoric cement 29, 000 cal yrs BP in B 2. It is assumed that Unit 1 formed in the late Pleistocene, mainly during MIS 5 e. An erosion surface (MR 2) carved sinkholes in Unit 1, with karstification taking place while the ACS was emergent during the last glacial period. The timing and span of subaerial exposure changes with depth within the <b>shelf.</b> <b>Unit</b> 2 accumulated on this karst surface in the Holocene, after postglacial sea level rise. At the B 1 margin, Unit 2 consists of early-lithified packstone to rudstone with attached corals. In B 2, the Holocene unit comprises a boundstone of encrusting invertebrates and calcareous algae similar to the living ones attached to the wall today. High productivity in the sinkholes probably promoted the growth of encrusting suspension feeders but also led to intense, multistory bioperforation of carbonates on the wall. The cup-shaped depressions are, therefore, the result of sinkhole formation during the last-glacial low sea levels and later carbonate accretion at sinkhole margins during the Holocene...|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} of a previously unrecognized unconformity and of new faunas in the type Llandovery area underpins a revised correlation of Hirnantian strata in mid Wales. This has revealed the sedimentary and faunal events which affected the Lower Palaeozoic Welsh Basin during the global rise in sea level that followed the end-Ordovician glacial maximum and has allowed their interpretation {{in the context of}} local and global influences. In peri-basinal shelfal settings the onset of post-glacial deepening is recorded by an unfossiliferous, transgressive shoreface sequence (Cwm Clyd Sandstone and Garth House formations) which rests unconformably on Rawtheyan rocks, deformed during an episode of pre-Hirnantian tectonism. In the deep water facies of the basin centre, this same sequence boundary is now recognized as the contact between fine-grained, re-sedimented mudstones and an underlying regressive sequence of turbidite sandstones and conglomerates; it is at a level lower than previously cited and calls into question the established lithostratigraphy. In younger Hirnantian strata, graptolites associated with the newly recognized Ystradwalter Member (Chwefri Formation) demonstrate that this distal <b>shelf</b> <b>unit</b> correlates with the persculptus graptolite-bearing Mottled Mudstone Member of the basinal succession. Together these members record an important macrofaunal recolonization of the Welsh Basin and mark a key event in the post-glacial transgression. Further deepening saw the establishment of a stratified water column and the imposition of anoxic bottom water conditions across the basin floor. These post-glacial Hirnantian events are consistent with the re-establishment of connections between a silled Welsh Basin and the open Iapetus Ocean. However, a comparison with other areas suggests that each event records a separate deepening episode within a pulsed glacio-eustatic transgression, while also reflecting changes in post-glacial climate and patterns of oceanic circulation and associated biotic flux. ...|$|E

40|$|Stable isotope, stratigraphic and micropalaeontological studies {{provide an}} insight into the {{preservation}} of Tertiary global cooling episodes in shelf carbonate rocks from the Mandamus-Pahau District in North Canterbury. Local shelf carbonate isotope analysis (δ 13 C and δ 18 O) shows these shelf rocks have not retained the original sea-water isotopic signature but have been altered during burial diagenesis. The Palaeocene to Late Eocene Coal Creek Formation from this district is a glauconite-rich, inner <b>shelf</b> <b>unit</b> transitioning to a mid-outer shelf environment. Separation of this unit from the Mid-Late Oligocene Cookson Volcanic Group {{is marked by a}} ~ 3 - 4 Ma hiatus representative of the Marshall Paraconformity. The Marshall Paraconformity is inferred throughout the district due to a distinct break in style and sedimentation from the Late Eocene until the Mid-Late Oligocene. Cookson Volcanic Group tuffaceous beds and pillow basalts represent localised intra-plate volcanism that occurred prior to the deposition of the Late Oligocene Flaxdown Limestone. This Oligocene limestone represents a mid shelf, bryozoan and algal-rich grainstone. Widespread development of this carbonate unit illustrates the absence of tectonically derived sediments prior to the deposition of the Pahau Siltstone Member. The Early Miocene marks the initiation of a new tectonic regime in New Zealand, with the deposition of the inner shelf, quartz-rich Pahau Siltstone Member due to tectonic associated uplift and erosion. These shelf sediments proved inadequate as a record of global climate excursions, with grainsize and the dominance of burial diagenesis limiting their use in global isotope records. Shelf sediments seen in this study mostly consist of grainstones or sandstones with the coarse grainsize of these units allowing a high flow of pore fluids through sediments. These pore fluids occurred out of equilibrium with bioclasts within these Tertiary units, increasing the alteration potential of bioclasts. This thesis provides strong evidence for problematic global isotopic signatures in local shelf sediments due to grainsize and diagenesis, yet other studies have proved it is possible to reconstruct the global isotope curve from shelf sediment records. Accurate shelf records depend on proxies less prone to diagenetic alteration that act as a reliable gauge of local and global environmental change...|$|E

Observing zero shrimp occupancy on the stacked shelving units, two alternate scenarios were constructed. Long, single shelves made of either white corrugated plastic or standard black mesh nylon screen were introduced into tanks. Shrimp reaction to shelves was observed for four stocking densities: 77, 179, 407 and 623 shrimp per square meter. Shrimp density was increased during a five-day period and shrimp behavior was noted as either swimming, on shelf, or on floor in five-minute increments during hour blocks from July 6 - 9 th, 2002.

ESMO is being developed through the extensive use of flight spared and commercial of the <b>shelf</b> <b>units.</b> As such ESMO is significantly constrained by the available mission delta-V. This provides a considerable challenge in designing a viable transfer and stable orbit around the Moon. Coupled with an all-day piggy-back launch opportunity, where ESMO has little or no control over the launch date, ESMO is considered to be an ambitious design. To overcome these inherent challenges, the use of a Weak Stability Boundary (WSB) transfer into a highly eccentric orbit is proposed. However to ensure accurate insertion around the Moon, ESMO must use a complex navigation strategy. This includes mitigation approaches and correction strategies. This paper will therefore present results from the ongoing orbit determination analysis and navigation scenarios to ensure capture around the Moon. While minimising the total delta-V, analysis includes planning for orbital control, scheduling and the introduction of Trajectory Correction Manoeuvres (TCMs).
