50|$|The Prather {{family was}} living in Kansas City, Missouri, by 1930, where Maurice Jr.'s father found work at a local {{business}} called Greenwood's. By {{the time he was}} in his senior year of high school, Maurice Jr. had become interested in photography and had an after-school job as an assistant cameraman and laboratory technician at the Calvin Company in Kansas City, the largest production company for industrial films in the world. Upon turning 18 in 1944, Prather did not join the armed forces as most American young people were during those wartime days (Prather may have suffered from a physical problem which prevented him from serving in the armed forces). Instead, he found work as a photographer of wartime airplanes for North American Aviation in Kansas City. In 1945, he became an engineering photographer for Trans World Airlines (TWA), who for many years had a hub in Kansas City. Still living with his parents in Kansas City, Prather then returned to the Calvin Company as an assistant cameraman for industrial films once again. This was the longest Prather held onto a job during these early days in Kansas City---two years (1946-1948). For some reason, he decided to abandon photography altogether for a one-year stint as a <b>schedule</b> <b>clerk</b> at a Sears-Roebuck department store in Kansas City. In 1949, he decided to get a college education and so enrolled in the journalism program at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas.|$|E
