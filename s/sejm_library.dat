50|$|The Senate {{building}} was originally an administrative {{building of the}} Polish Sejm, which was built during the early 1950s and eventually became the <b>Sejm</b> <b>library.</b> However, in 1989, with the re-establishment of the Senate, {{the need for a}} permanent workplace for the new institution became obvious. At the time only the Sejm's chamber was big enough to hold Senate debates, so, as a compromise the Senate made temporary use of the Sejm chamber whilst plans for a new Senate building were drawn up. In the meantime the senate's administrative offices and facilities for senators were moved into Bohdan Pniewski's 1950s east wing of the Sejm complex.|$|E
50|$|Since 1780 the Załuski Library {{has been}} {{entitled}} to a copy of all works published in Poland. In modern times the issue is regulated by a Decree of the Minister of Culture and Arts of March 6, 1997. The National Library of Poland and the Jagiellonian Library receive two copies of all publications, {{one of which is}} to be stored indefinitely. In addition to that, there are 15 other libraries to receive legal deposits to be stored for no less than 50 years: Maria Curie-Skłodowska University Library, University of Łódź Library, Nicolaus Copernicus University Library, Adam Mickiewicz University Library, Warsaw University Library, University of Wrocław Library, Silesian Library, City of Warsaw Library, Pomeranian Library in Szczecin, University of Gdańsk Library, Catholic University of Lublin Library, University of Opole Library and Podlaskie Library in Białystok. The National Film Library (Filmoteka Narodowa) is to receive all film productions, while the <b>Sejm</b> <b>Library</b> receives a copy of all legal documents.|$|E
5|$|Polish {{literature}} faced {{a similar}} fate in territories annexed by Germany, where the sale of Polish books was forbidden. The public destruction of Polish books {{was not limited to}} those seized from libraries, but also included those books that were confiscated from private homes. The last Polish book titles not already proscribed were withdrawn in 1943; even Polish prayer books were confiscated. Soon after the occupation began, most libraries were closed; in Kraków, about 80% of the libraries were closed immediately, while the remainder saw their collections decimated by censors. The occupying powers destroyed Polish book collections, including the <b>Sejm</b> and Senate <b>Library,</b> the Przedziecki Estate Library, the Zamoyski Estate Library, the Central Military Library, and the Rapperswil Collection. In 1941, the last remaining Polish public library in the German-occupied territories was closed in Warsaw. During the war, Warsaw libraries lost about a million volumes, or 30% of their collections. More than 80% of these losses were the direct result of purges rather than wartime conflict. Overall, it is estimated that about 10million volumes from state-owned libraries and institutions perished during the war.|$|R
40|$|The {{establishment}} of the <b>Sejm</b> <b>Library</b> followed Poland???s regaining of independence in 1918 and the ensuing parliamentary election of 1919. The library was set {{up at the end}} of 1919, and after many organizational changes it came to incorporate the Senate Library and the parliamentary archives. By 1939 the library???s collection amounted to 78, 000 volumes, including parliamentary and official publications as well as books and journals on law and the social, economic, and historical sciences. In September 1939, a fire destroyed part of the collection, while the remaining 62, 000 volumes were transported by the Germans to Berlin where they disappeared in circumstances that were never clarified. Only a small part of the collection, deposited before the end of the war in Castle Houska in Czechoslovakia, returned to Poland. In a one-chamber parliament set up after World War II, the library, functioning under the name of the ???<b>Sejm</b> <b>Library,???</b> had to rebuild its collections almost from scratch. In 1991, the library took over the 145, 000 volume library collection of the former Archives of the Polish Left, and in 1993 the Sejm Archives was incorporated into it. Currently, the entirely automated library has a collection of about 500, 000 volumes and provides services for both chambers of the Polish Parliament. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|E
