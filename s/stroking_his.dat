5|$|The Dawn of Love, {{also known}} as Venus Now Wakes, and Wakens Love, is an oil {{painting}} on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited in 1828 and currently in the Russell-Cotes Art Gallery & Museum in Bournemouth. Loosely based on a passage from John Milton's 1634 masque Comus, it shows a nude Venus leaning across to wake the sleeping Love by <b>stroking</b> <b>his</b> wings. While Etty often included nude figures in his work he rarely depicted physical intimacy, and owing to this The Dawn of Love {{is one of his}} more unusual paintings. The open sensuality of the work was intended to present a challenge to the viewer mirroring the plot of Comus, in which the heroine is tempted by desire but remains rational and detached.|$|E
5|$|At Christ Church {{college at}} Oxford, {{where he was}} an {{undergraduate}} from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor Hugh Allen. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend. In 1909 Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled Some Notes on Performance, in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer's wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, {{and the effect of}} music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career. He was president of the University Musical Club for the year 1910, but his interests were not wholly confined to music: he was a keen rower, <b>stroking</b> <b>his</b> college boat at Henley, and all his life he remained a member of the Leander Club.|$|E
25|$|In 1904, a Viking Age {{statuette}} {{identified as}} a depiction of Freyr was discovered on the farm Rällinge in Lunda, Södermanland parish {{in the province of}} Södermanland, Sweden. The depiction features a cross-legged seated, bearded male with an erect penis. He is wearing a pointed cap and <b>stroking</b> <b>his</b> triangular beard. The statue is 9 centimeters tall and is displayed at the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities.|$|E

Although his {{residence}} is just a partitioned tenement house, it has an elegant, latticed door, a nameplate and letterbox. Inside, the entry...leads to a room with worn tatami mats upon which a long hibachi has been placed. The space is also adorned with a Buddhist altar. A cluttered desk stands {{at the back of the}} miserable two-tatami room; it is hard to believe that the well-known artist Kunichika lives here...Looking around with a piercing gaze and <b>stroking</b> <b>his</b> long white beard, Kunichika talks about the height of prosperity of the Edokko...|$|E
500|$|Etty's {{painting}} {{is not a}} direct illustration of a scene from Comus. Instead, it is inspired by an early passage in which Comus, prior to his meeting with The Lady, muses {{on the notion that}} sin is only problematic if others become aware of it, and thus that it is right and natural to surrender to base desires while under cover of darkness, arguing that [...] "What hath night to do with sleep? Night hath better sweets to prove, Venus now wakes, and wakens Love". Etty's painting shows the nude Venus, as [...] "Goddess of nocturnal sport", reaching across to wake the sleeping Love by <b>stroking</b> <b>his</b> wings. While Etty had built his reputation on his renowned ability to paint realistic human figures, Venus in The Dawn of Love is highly stylised, and painted in a deliberate pastiche of the style of Rubens.|$|E
500|$|While McGregor {{is slowly}} {{building}} up {{his idea of}} marching men (his law practice on the backburner), he decides {{that he wants to}} marry Margaret Ormsby. As he is leaving a formal party at her family's mansion, McGregor asks Margaret to marry him, but gets nervous and flees before she can respond. A few weeks later, McGregor falls asleep at the house of Edith Carson and wakes up with her <b>stroking</b> <b>his</b> hair. Realizing that their relationship is more intimate then he had thought, he goes to Margaret and reveals his past experiences with women. Margaret hears McGregor's confession and declares that she will still marry him, but first, she must go talk to Edith. A few weeks later, when McGregor is in the neighborhood for a teamster's strike, he finds that Edith's shop had recently come under new ownership. Rushing to the train station, he finds Edith about to depart. Together, they go to the Ormsby house and in a confrontation Margaret cedes her claim over McGregor to Edith. As Edith and McGregor are leaving, Margaret's father, David, leader of a plow trust (nicknamed [...] "Ormsby the Prince" [...] by the City's oligarchs), extends a hand to McGregor. The two men shake, the narrator noting their polite antagonism towards each other.|$|E

2500|$|After the {{feud with}} Steamboat and Douglas ended, the Blonds were {{programmed}} with the recently reformed Four Horsemen, {{who at the}} time consisted of Ric Flair, Paul Roma, and Ole and Arn Anderson. Flair had recently returned from a run with then World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and been given a talk show segment called [...] "A Flair for the Gold" [...] to give Flair television time before his WWF release allowed him to wrestle for WCW. Playing off their image of believing they're the best thing in wrestling, Pillman and Austin started to target Flair and Anderson by mocking them through their own segment called [...] "A Flare for the Old". Austin would stand in the background with a pillow under his shirt for a gut while slowly <b>stroking</b> <b>his</b> chin imitating Arn Anderson. Pillman dressed up in an old bathrobe, put on reading glasses and a grey wig and then cut into Flair for being too old and too scared of the Hollywood Blonds. The impersonation drew Ric Flair back in the ring making his [...] "Big Show" [...] wrestling return at Clash of Champions XXIII, where Flair and Anderson challenged the Blonds for the tag team titles. Despite winning the two out of three falls match, they did not win the titles since the Blonds were disqualified after Barry Windham interfered.|$|E
2500|$|In 1890, Indians named [...] "No Neck" [...] and [...] "Black Heart" [...] {{testified in}} an inquiry before the Office of Indian Affairs. [...] The hearing weighed the {{morality}} of Indian employment in show business. [...] "You are engaged in the exhibition or show business," [...] observed the acting commissioner, A.C. Belt. [...] "It is not considered among white people a very helpful or elevating business. [...] I believe that which {{is not good for}} the white people is not good for the Indians, and what is bad for the white people is bad for the Indians." [...] The Indians defended their work as adamantly as any white performer, and they turned the inquiry into a pointed denunciation of the Indian policy by comparing conditions in the show with those of the Pine Ridge Agency. [...] The contrast reflected poorly on the Office of Indian Affairs. Rocky Bear began by pointing out that he long had served the interests of the federal government (Great White Father) by encouraging the development of Indian reservations. [...] He worked in a show that fed him well; [...] "that is why I am getting so fat," [...] he said, <b>stroking</b> <b>his</b> cheeks. [...] It was only in returning to the reservation that [...] "I am getting poor." [...] If the Great [...] Father wanted him to stop appearing in the show, he would stop. [...] But until then, [...] "that is the way I get money." [...] When he showed his inquisitors a purse filled with $300 in gold coins, saying [...] "I saved this money to buy some clothes for my children," [...] they were silenced. [...] Black Heart, too, denounced the allegations of mistreatment. [...] "We were raised on horseback; that is the way we had to work." [...] Buffalo Bill Cody and Nate Salsbury [...] "furnished us the same work we were raised to; that is the reason we want to work these kind of men." ...|$|E
