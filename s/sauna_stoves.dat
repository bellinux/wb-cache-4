They obtained their livelihood from variety of things, such as repairing machines and railway carriages, manufacturing tanks and producing <b>sauna</b> <b>stoves.</b> The company moved to Joroinen in 1979 and {{in the beginning of}} the 1980s the company created a product that became its most successful so far: the Muurikka frying pan. The pans sold widely in Finland. The Muurikka pans were made from steel that was left over from producing tanks. The company’s other best-selling product in the 1980s was the Sipako fuel tank, which was exported for instance to the Soviet Union.|$|E
50|$|The Yrjönkatu Swimming Hall's {{first floor}} {{contains}} a 25 × 10 metre pool, two saunas and dressing closets {{at the edges}} of the pool. The second floor contains resting cabins, saunas and a café. The hall sells two kinds of tickets, providing access either to the first floor only or to both floors. Traditionally, people swam naked in the pool, but since 2001, it has been allowed to wear a swimsuit. Men and women have separate days for swimming. In March 2012, the hall reported it was switching its original 1928 wooden sauna stove to a new one to cut down on the smoke damages to the Forum building. The new wooden sauna stove was taken into use in August 2013. It is 2.8 metres high and is thought to be one of the largest wooden <b>sauna</b> <b>stoves</b> in Finland.|$|E

50|$|In city apartments, and in {{most public}} saunas, an {{electric}} <b>sauna</b> <b>stove</b> (kiuas) is used, as {{it does not require}} wood to burn. They are very simple to prepare, only a press of a button will do. They usually have stones to retain heat, like their smoke <b>sauna</b> and wood <b>stove</b> counterparts, but sometimes even a large slab of stone is used to give the same effect as you throw water on it. Most apartment buildings in Finland include at least this type of sauna, or there is one for use by the occupants of a building, with dedicated hours for use for communal men's and women's sauna, and special hours for those who have requested apartment specific hours. Most Finns prefer a wood <b>stove</b> <b>sauna</b> to an electric sauna.|$|R

40|$|The article revisits and reevaluates {{the origins}} of the North Finnic word for ‘sauna stove’. According to the {{received}} view – originally presented in Uuno Taavi Sirelius’ (1907) study on dwellings of Uralic peoples – Finnish kiuas with variants such as kiukaa, kiukoa and kiukas, Karelian kiuku(v) a and kiugua as well as Ingrian kiukā and Vote tšiukas originate in the Finnic (Finnish) compound noun *kivikota made up of kivi ‘stone’ and kota ‘hut; shelter’. Further, Lude kiudug and Veps küudug ‘sauna stove’ have also been related to the above-mentioned words. Critical reevaluation of the received view makes it evident that the *kivikota ‘stone hut’ explanation is quite problematic both from a morphological and semantic point of view. From the morphological perspective, the *kivikota hypothesis presupposes a large array of sound changes and analogical shifts that nevertheless account only for a fraction of actual variants of the word without severely conflicting with a number of well-known sound changes in North Finnic. From the semantic perspective, relation of <b>sauna</b> <b>stoves</b> – originally consisting of heaps of stones – to the primary referents of kota ‘hut; shelter’ has never been explained. As the classical “stone hut” explanation must be considered unsatisfying, there are good reasons to reevaluate a nearly forgotten conjecture put forward by A. E. Lindfors (1893) who proposed that kiuas might originate in the compound noun *kivikasa, consisting of kivi ‘stone’ and kasa ‘pile; heap’. As it turns out, the *kivikasa hypothesis accounts for most of the morphological variants as well as the semantic functions of Finnish kiuas, Karelian kiukua and their obvious cognates in Ingrian and Vote. Although the initial step in {{the emergence of a new}} noun for ‘sauna stove’ has required a sporadic and irregular change from the compound *kivikasa ‘heap of stones’ towards the less transparent *kiukas(a), the subsequent development à la *kivikasa (nominative) : *kivikasan (genitive) >> present-day Finnish kiu(k) as : kiuka(h) an etc. must be regarded more or less regular. As for the semantics, a reconstructed meaning ‘heap of stones’ for ‘sauna stove’ is paralleled by analogical compounds like Moksha kevmar (кевмар) ‘sauna stove; heap of stones’ (from kev ‘stone’ and mar ‘heap’) and is thus far more plausible than the received view about the “stone hut” origins of kiuas. The paper concludes that the “stone hut” theory on {{the origins of}} the word for the core element of Finnic sauna must be abandoned as invalid and unproven, whereas the compound *kivikasa ‘heap of stones’ provides a nearly perfect explanation. The main reason for the popularity of the *kivikota theory appears to be the fact that Sirelius’ premature hypothesis has been gradually canonized in the absence of any serious attempts to question its plausibility or to provide alternative, morphologically and semantically sound explanations for the designation of the very core of the Finnic sauna culture...|$|E
5000|$|As {{a result}} of the Industrial Revolution, the sauna evolved to use a metal woodstove, or kiuas , with a chimney. Air {{temperatures}} averaged around [...] but sometimes exceeded [...] in a traditional Finnish sauna. When the Finns migrated to other areas of the globe they brought their sauna designs and traditions with them. This led to further evolution of the sauna, including the electric <b>sauna</b> <b>stove,</b> which was introduced in 1938 by Metos Ltd in Vaasa [...] Although the culture of sauna nowadays is more or less related to Finnish culture, the evolution of sauna happened around the same time both in Finland and the Baltic countries sharing the same meaning and importance of sauna in daily life, shared still to this day. The Sauna became very popular especially in Scandinavia and the German speaking regions of Europe after the Second World War. German soldiers had got to know the Finnish saunas during their fight against the Soviet Union in the Continuation War, where Germany and Finland fought on the same side. Finnish hygiene depended so exclusively on saunas, that they had built saunas not only in mobile tents but even in bunkers.. After the war, the German soldiers brought the habit back to Germany and Austria, where it became popular {{in the second half of}} the 20th century. The German sauna culture also became popular in neighbouring countries such as Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.|$|R
50|$|The wood <b>stove</b> <b>sauna</b> is {{the most}} common type of sauna outside of the city areas, where the {{electric}} sauna is more common. The metal stove with stones on top (kiuas) is heated with birch wood fire, and this heats the sauna room to the required temperature. If birch wood is not available any other wood will do, but well dried birch wood is preferred because of its good quality and smell, and long lasting burn. The important thing is to have a good löyly, that is when the stones are hot enough to evaporate the water thrown on them into steam that rises to the bathers. The bather in every type of sauna sits on a high bench near the ceiling where the hot steam reaches them quickly.|$|R
