40|$|To better {{understand}} the relationship between the U.

Examining <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> <b>court</b> decisions in search and seizure cases decided by the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> between 1983 and 1993, we specifically test hypotheses about how state judicial context and <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> behavior influences when the lower court is likely to be affected by <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> precedent. We find that there is substantial variation in the responses to precedent by <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> <b>courts.</b> We find that precedent has a substantial influence on the behavior of <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> <b>court</b> justices, but judicial ideology and the level of historical conflict between the <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> and the <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> <b>court</b> also influence the dissemination of precedent to the states.

40|$|<b>State</b> <b>supreme</b> <b>courts</b> {{occasionally}} rely on {{the provisions}} of their own state constitutions to expand rights for their citizens beyond the protections that the U. S. <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> has interpreted the U. S. Constitution to require. This practice {{is known as the}} New Judicial Federalism. <b>State</b> <b>supreme</b> <b>courts</b> have the prerogative to recognize more expansive rights under their state constitutions because the U. S. Constitution sets a floor and not a ceiling for the protection of individual rights. On the other hand, the U. S. <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> has unmatched resources as well as unparalleled prestige, and most <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> <b>courts</b> give considerable respect and deference to its interpretations of common or similar constitutional language. The challenge for political scientists is to explain why some <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> <b>courts</b> have chosen to expand rights and why other courts prefer to follow the example and interpretation of the U. S. <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court.</b> I hypothesize that <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> <b>courts</b> are engaged in an ongoing dialogue about rights by considering the reasoning contained in sister <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> <b>court</b> decisions, prior deciding court precedent, and changes in U. S. <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> precedent, when deciding whether to expand rights under state constitutions. This dissertation examines the decisions of <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> <b>courts,</b> as well as interviews with <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> <b>court</b> justices, to examine why <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> <b>courts</b> sometimes render rights expanding decisions, but more often follow the approach adopted by the U.

40|$|<b>State</b> <b>supreme</b> <b>courts</b> are {{autonomous}} {{institutions with}} significant power. Yet, despite this authority, <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> <b>courts</b> routinely rely {{on one another}} to explain why and how they reached their decisions. This puzzle of why <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> <b>courts</b> cite {{each other in their}} opinions led me to pose two questions. First, under what conditions do <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> <b>courts</b> cite other <b>states</b> <b>supreme</b> <b>courts?</b> And second, to whom do they turn for guidance? To answer these questions, I propose a new theory for evaluating <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> <b>court</b> citations, the social learning model. I borrow policy diffusion’s learning mechanism and I pair it with network theory and methods to explain peer-to-peer <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> <b>court</b> citations practices. I argue that courts are social actors who interact, influence, and learn from one another, and the citations are communications by and between the courts. To model citations between courts, I apply a temporal exponential random graph network analysis model or TERGM. TERGMs simulate the evolution of the state-to-state citation network by including aspects of both the courts and the network structure. I argue that only by understanding how networks and issue areas evolve can we begin to understand how courts and justices make decisions. The network approach to citations specifically tests these endogenous relationships, it also directly models the complex dependencies of citation networks. My findings demonstrate the courts became more connected over time and no single <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> <b>court</b> leader emerges. I find that citations are endogenous; what one court does affects other courts. I also discover that the area of law matters a lot and it is insufficient to pool all legal issues into a single model. Finally, <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> <b>courts</b> do not cite <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> <b>courts</b> who look like them. Overall, the evidence suggests the courts are learning from each other. The courts’ written language discloses the mechanism. Courts state their own case law does not provide a solution to the question presented and they must seek answers elsewhere. Additionally, the courts do not always cite the same state, as we would expect from emulation. Together, these findings demonstrate that <b>state</b> <b>supreme</b> <b>courts</b> are connected, they learn from one another...|$|R

5|$|In 1867, United <b>States</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> justice Stephen Johnson Field {{assigned}} Deady {{to serve}} as a circuit court judge for the United States circuit court located in San Francisco, California.
