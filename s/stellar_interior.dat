40|$|Accepted for {{publication}} in A&AThis work {{is a continuation of}} our efforts to develop an efficient implicit solver for multidimensional hydrodynamics for the purpose of studying important physical processes in <b>stellar</b> <b>interiors,</b> such as turbulent convection and overshooting. We present an implicit solver that results from the combination of a Jacobian-Free Newton-Krylov method and a preconditioning technique tailored to the inviscid, compressible equations of stellar hydrodynamics. We assess the accuracy and performance of the solver for both 2 D and 3 D problems for Mach numbers down to $ 10 ^{- 6 }$. Although our applications concern flows in <b>stellar</b> <b>interiors,</b> the method can be applied to general advection and/or diffusion-dominated flows.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of stably stratified stellar radiative zones is of considerable interest {{due to the}} availability of increasingly detailed observations of Solar and <b>stellar</b> <b>interiors.</b> This article reports the first non-axisymmetric and time-dependent simulations of flows of anelastic fluids driven by baroclinic torques in stably stratified rotating spherical shells – a system serving as an elemental model of a stellar radiative zone. With increasing baroclinicity a sequence of bifurcations from simpler to more complex flows is found in which some of the available symmetries of the problem are broken subsequently. The poloidal component of the flow grows relative to the dominant toroidal component with increasing baroclinicity. The possibility of magnetic field generation thus arises and this paper proceeds to provide some indications for self-sustained dynamo action in baroclinically-driven flows.

40|$|Shear flows have a {{significant}} impact on the dynamics in various astrophysical objects, including accretion discs and <b>stellar</b> <b>interiors.</b> Due to observational limitations the complex dynamics in <b>stellar</b> <b>interiors</b> that result in turbulent motions, mixing processes, and magnetic field generation, are not entirely understood. It is therefore necessary to investigate the inevitable small-scale dynamics via numerical calculations. In particular a thin region with strong shear at the base of the convection zone in the Sun, the tachocline, is believed to play an important role in the Sun's interior dynamics and magnetic field generation. Velocity measurements suggest a stable tachocline. However, helioseismology can only provide large-scale time-averaged measurements, so small scale turbulent motions can still be present. Therefore, studying the stability of shear flows and their non-linear evolution in a fully compressible polytropic atmosphere provides a fundamental understanding of potential motion in <b>stellar</b> <b>interiors</b> and is the main focus of this thesis. To commence the investigations a linear stability analysis of a stratified system in a two-dimensional Cartesian geometry is performed to study the effect of compressibility and thermal diffusivity on the stability threshold. In addition, this first investigation provides a reference for subsequent non-linear calculations. Focusing on a local model of unstable shear flows, direct numerical calculations are used to first compare numerical forcing methods to sustain a shear flow against viscous dissipation; and then to study the effect of key parameters on the saturated quasi-steady regime. Finally, magnetic fields are included and the full set of MHD equations is solved to study a potential kinematic dynamo in shear-driven turbulence...|$|R
