This gland controls the release of corticosteroids and catecholamines - such as corticosterone and aldosterone - which play the primary role in the regulation of water and ion balance.

40|$|Bacterial {{growth and}} <b>survival</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> {{as well as}} in {{association}} with human hosts are constrained by the action of phagocytic eukaryotic cells. Phagocytic predation on bacteria by host immune cells shares a number of cellular mechanisms with free-living protozoa. In and outside the human host, bacteria growing in biofilms appear to be less vulnerable to phagocytic predators than planktonic cells. Widespread resistance against predators is mediated by the interplay of biofilm-specific traits such as substratum adherence, exopolymer production, cellular cooperation, inhibitor secretion, and phenotypic variation. Selective predation is suggested to promote bacterial life in the biofilm niche and to govern structure-function relationships. There is increasing evidence that some of the pathogenicity traits may have their origin specifically in successful antipredator adaptations. Parallel selective pressures in and outside the human host may result in cross-adaptations of bacterial pathogens...|$|E

The human pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus and related Ascomycetes produce dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) melanin in conidia, which is essential for inhibiting phagolysosome acidification. In contrast, Aspergillus terreus lacks genes for biosynthesis of DHN-melanin. Therefore, {{the origin of the}} pigment in A. terreus conidia was elucidated. Expression analyses from conidiation conditions identified genes coding for an unusual NRPS-like enzyme (MelA) and a tyrosinase. MelA produces aspulvinone E as precursor, which is activated for polymerisation by the tyrosinase TyrP as shown by heterologous in vivo and in vitro reconstitution of pigment formation. Functional studies revealed that the pigment confers resistance against UV-light and hampers phagocytosis by soil amoeba, but does not inhibit acidification of phagolysosomes.

Even though they do not cause severe systemic inflammatory responses, such as septic shock, enterococci present a therapeutic challenge because of their resistance to {{a vast array of}} antimicrobial drugs, including cell-wall active agents, all commercially available aminoglycosides, penicillin and ampicillin, and vancomycin. The combination of the latter two occurs disproportionately in strains resistant to many other antimicrobial drugs. The propensity of enterococci to acquire resistance may relate to their ability to participate in various forms of conjugation, which can result in the spread of genes as part of conjugative transposons, pheromone-responsive plasmids, or broad host-range plasmids.
