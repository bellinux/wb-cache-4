2500|$|Academic criticisms {{were made}} {{pertaining}} to sample selection and sample {{bias in the}} reports' methodology. This was {{despite the fact that}} Kinsey sought to work on a more 'complete' report that would have involved 100000 interviews and that the initial 1948 publication was merely considered by him to be a sample progress report. Two main problems cited were that significant portions of the samples come from prison populations and male prostitutes, and that people who volunteer to be interviewed about taboo subject are likely to create a self-selection bias. Both undermine the usefulness of the sample in terms of determining the tendencies of the overall population. In 1948, the same year as the original publication, a committee of the American Statistical Association, including notable statisticians such as John Tukey, condemned the <b>sampling</b> <b>procedure.</b> Tukey was perhaps the most vocal critic, saying, [...] "A random selection of three people would have been better than a group of 300 chosen by Mr. Kinsey." [...] Psychologist Abraham Maslow asserted that Kinsey did not consider [...] "volunteer bias". The data represented only those volunteering to participate in discussion of taboo topics. Most Americans were reluctant to discuss the intimate details of their sex lives even with their spouses and close friends. Before the publication of Kinsey's reports, Maslow tested Kinsey's volunteers for bias. He concluded that Kinsey's sample was unrepresentative of the general population. [...] In 1954, leading statisticians, including William Gemmell Cochran, Frederick Mosteller, John Tukey, and W. O. Jenkins issued for the American Statistical Association a critique of Kinsey’s 1948 report on the human male, stating: ...|$|E
