5|$|Paddington {{station has}} been {{referred}} to in several popular works of fiction. It is mentioned in several Sherlock Holmes novels. In The Hound of the Baskervilles, Watson and his companions Dr. Mortimer and Sir Henry Baskerville leave for Dartmoor from Paddington, while in The Boscombe Valley Mystery, Holmes and Watson leave the station for a train to Boscombe Valley near Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire. The mystery novel 4.50 From Paddington (1952) by Agatha Christie begins with a murder witnessed by a passenger on a train from Paddington. One of The Railway Series books, The Eight Famous Engines, contains a story about Gordon, Duck and a foreign engine debating which station London is. Duck says that he used to work at Paddington <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> that Paddington is most important. However, Gordon later finds out that the station in London is St Pancras. There is a fictional underground Paddington station on the North London System in the novel The Horn of Mortal Danger (1980).|$|E
25|$|On Monday 28 December, {{the first}} day of the runoff campaign, the {{incumbent}} president Stjepan Mesić indicated that he supports Ivo Josipović to be his successor. He praised his manifesto and said Croatia needs a president working actively against corruption and for justice. He also insulted Milan Bandić saying it was impossible he only spent 3million kuna for the campaign saying he knows how much a campaign costs. He pleaded for more transparency and called on him to release the names of those who were really financing his campaign. Bandić responded by saying that Mesić hasn't released the names of his donors to this day and that he was a part of both of his campaigns <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> how nontransparent they were. Mesić called Bandić a liar saying he was the only one in those days to release the name of every single person who contributed to his victory. He said his campaign reports were published, on Croatian, not English, clearly referring to the fact that Bandić couldn't speak proper English. He also suggested there could be one debate held entirely in English, mocking Bandić since he previously claimed he speaks the language. Bandić responded saying he would be glad to attend that debate only if Mesić was moderating it, referring to the fact that the president himself was also not an English speaker. He also called the president an 'old man' saying it was only natural he forgot about the help he provided him during his two campaigns.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} shot in Vancouver during the summer, where {{temperatures}} were over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Executive producer Jeff Pinkner commented that despite the heat, guest actor Leonard Nimoy [...] "was doing pages and pages of dialogue, and he handled it like a pro," [...] while co-star Joshua Jackson joked that [...] " [...] wife said he practices biofeedback, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> how to control his body temperature". Chappelle called the episode [...] "intriguing because it's a summation of everything that came before it, so we're resolving {{a lot of issues}} and a lot of questions. But it's also a springboard into the rest of the season". Actor John Noble, who played Walter Bishop, called it [...] "probably one of our strongest and densest episodes" [...] because it [...] "changes the whole direction of the show".|$|E

Dwight races to the HarperCollins office, where Michael and Dwight start {{fighting}} over the client, Daniel Scofield (Bob Gebert). Mr. Scofield asks for both of their offers via email, and they agree to do so. Before leaving, Dwight then looks at Daniel's personal information from Michael's Rolodex card and asks him about his [...] "gay son", which seemingly perturbs Daniel. [...] Michael reveals his unusual system where he color codes personal information about his contacts <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> what not to talk about. Michael is seen laughing with Daniel in the parking lot as Dwight returns to his car alone.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Poplington {{was very}} {{pleasant}} and chatty, {{and of course}} asked a great many questions about America. Nearly all English people I've met {{want to talk about}} our country, {{and it seems to me}} that what they do know about it isn't any better, considered as useful information, than what they don't know. But Mr. Poplington has never been to America, and <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> more about us than those Englishmen who come over to write books, and only have time to run around the outside of things, and get themselves tripped up on our ragged edges.|$|E
60|$|All this {{answered}} right, and I {{had nothing}} to do but to keep my Turkish dress out of the way, to be myself unknown to my child, for as he had never seen Roxana, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> nothing of me.|$|R
60|$|Fred did {{not dare}} to leave his place of concealment, {{and even if it}} had been {{perfectly}} safe to do <b>so,</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> not in which direction to look for his friend, therefore nothing could be done save exercise patience.|$|R
60|$|At a {{distance}} {{he could hear}} the others talking, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> they were not far off. They, too, were now among the big rocks, and each hidden from the others. Then the talking gradually ceased, giving way to an occasional call or whistle.|$|R

The man that has a broken arm, as he knows it, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> of himself he cannot set it. This {{therefore}} is a second thing that declares a man is poor, otherwise he is not so. For suppose a man wants never so much, yet if he can but help himself, if he can furnish himself, if he can supply his own wants out of what he has, he cannot be a poor man. Yea, the more he wants, the greater are his riches, if he can supply his own wants {{out of his own}} purse.|$|E
60|$|In {{the first}} place, {{as he is}} the father of English poetry, so I hold him in the same degree of veneration as the Grecians held Homer, or the Romans Virgil. He is a {{perpetual}} fountain of good sense; learned in all sciences, and therefore speaks properly on all subjects; as he knew what to say, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> also when to leave off--a continence which is practised by few writers, and scarcely by any of the ancients, excepting Virgil and Horace. One of our late great poets is sunk in his reputation, because he could never forgive any conceit which came in his way; but swept like a drag-net, great and small. There was plenty enough, but the dishes were ill-sorted; whole pyramids of sweetmeats, for boys and women; but little of solid meat, for men. All this proceeded not from any want of knowledge, but of judgment; neither did he want that in discerning the beauties and faults of other poets; but only indulged himself in the luxury of writing; and perhaps knew it was a fault, but hoped the reader would not find it. For this reason, though he must always be thought a great poet, he is no longer esteemed a good writer; and for ten impressions, which his works have had in so many successive years, yet at present a hundred books are scarcely purchased once a twelvemonth: for, as my last Lord Rochester said, though somewhat profanely, not being of God, he could not stand.|$|E
60|$|She {{turned and}} left me, and almost {{immediately}} the butler entered the hall. He {{was one of the}} local cricket eleven, and had been in service in the neighborhood all his life, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> me well, and greeted me at once with respectful interest.|$|R
