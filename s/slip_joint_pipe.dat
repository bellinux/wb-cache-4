40|$|The {{susceptibility}} of a cantilevered tube conveying {{water to}} self-excitation by leakage flow through a <b>slip</b> <b>joint</b> is assessed experimentally. The <b>slip</b> <b>joint</b> is formed by inserting a smaller, rigid tube into the free {{end of the}} cantilevered tube. Variations of the <b>slip</b> <b>joint</b> annular gaps and engagement lengths are tested, and several mechanisms for self-excitation are described...|$|R
40|$|Eccentricity of a {{specific}} slip-joint design separating two cantilevered, telescoping tubes did not create any self-excited lateral vibrations {{that had not been}} observed previously for a concentric <b>slip</b> <b>joint.</b> In fact, the eccentricity made instabilities less likely to occur, but only marginally. Most important, design rules previously established to avoid instabilities for the concentric <b>slip</b> <b>joint</b> remain valid for the eccentric <b>slip</b> <b>joint...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{conditions}} are given {{for which the}} more flexible of two cantilevered, telescoping tubes conveying fluid can be self-excited by flow leaking from an un-constricted <b>slip</b> <b>joint.</b> Also, a physical explanation of the excitation mechanism is discussed, and a design rule to avoid the mechanism is presented.

50|$|<b>Slip</b> <b>joints</b> are {{sometimes}} found in tubular {{structures such as}} piping, but are generally avoided for this application due to requirements for sealing against leakage, instead using either a large loop that is allowed to flex or a semi-rigid bellows. <b>Slip</b> <b>joints</b> are used when the main problem is a large axial movement. Pipe supports often are <b>slip</b> <b>joints</b> {{to allow for the}} thermal expansion or contraction of the pipe relative to the support.|$|R

40|$|Masonry {{structures}} contain <b>slip</b> <b>joints</b> between {{concrete slabs}} and their supporting masonry walls to accommodate differential movements due to concrete slab shrinkage or thermal effects. Traditionally <b>slip</b> <b>joints</b> consist {{of one or}} two layers of a membrane type material placed between the masonry and the concrete. These materials are usually an embossed polythene, greased steel or bitumen-coated aluminium. According to Australian Standards all structures must be designed for earthquake loading. Therefore the <b>slip</b> <b>joints</b> must satisfy two apparently conflicting requirements - slip under long-term loads and transmit short-term earthquake loads. Tests at the Universities of Newcastle and Adelaide have indicated that these types of joints exhibit substantial shear capacity under short-term loads. The performance of these joints under induced long-term strains (i. e. differential movement effects) and their potential to behave as <b>slip</b> <b>joints</b> have also been established in thermal expansion tests developed at the University of Newcastle. It was found that, of all currently used <b>slip</b> <b>joint</b> materials, embossed polythene satisfies both major structural requirements best. It is, however, desirable for the design of shear wall systems to have a wider range of materials available. The purpose of current tests is to check long term shear transfer capacity of alternative materials. Test results will be presented...|$|R

40|$|Variations in {{the design}} of a {{specific}} <b>slip</b> <b>joint</b> separating two cantilevered, telescoping tubes conveying water were studied to determine their effect upon the leakage flow-induced vibration self-excitation mechanism known to exist for the original <b>slip</b> <b>joint</b> geometry. The important parameters controlling the self-excitation mechanism were identified, which, along with previous results, allowed the determination of a comprehensive set of design rules to avoid unstable vibrations. This was possible even though a new self-excitation mechanism was found when the engagement of the two tubes was small...|$|R

50|$|<b>Slip</b> <b>joints</b> can be {{designed}} to allow continuous relative motion of two components or it can allow an adjustment from one temporarily fixed position to another. Examples of the latter are tripods, hiking poles, or similar telescoping device. The position is fixed using a clamping mechanism based on a cam, a set screw or similar locking mechanism. <b>Slip</b> <b>joints</b> can also be non-telescoping, such as the joints on some older wooden surveyor's levelling rods. These use a joint that keeps the sections offset from each other but able to be slid together for transport.|$|R

40|$|Load-bearing masonry {{buildings}} {{are composed of}} concrete slabs and supporting masonry walls, and in Australia usually incorporate <b>slip</b> <b>joints</b> in the interfaces between walls and slabs for serviceability reasons. The apparent conflicting requirements of the <b>slip</b> <b>joints,</b> to <b>slip</b> under long-term loads and to transmit short-term loading from wind and earthquake actions, together {{with the lack of}} attention to the design of <b>slip</b> <b>joints,</b> make <b>slip</b> in the <b>joints</b> likely to occur when the building is subjected to a lateral loading. <b>Joint</b> <b>slip</b> leads to a redistribution of loading in the building wall system, resulting in wall shear loads different from that determined using the current standard elastic design procedures. Redistribution of loading may be also caused by softening of the masonry. This paper has assessed the realistic response of various load-bearing masonry buildings, including the potential for <b>slip</b> in the <b>joints</b> and softening of the masonry, and evaluated the level of wall shear load deviations resulting from the application of current design procedures. Analyses of the buildings, using non-linear static and dynamic finite element models, have indicated that <b>joint</b> <b>slip</b> may occur in buildings subjected to earthquake loading. The application of current elastic design procedures, which do not account for loading redistribution, resulted in major wall shear load deviations, such as overestimations of up to + 75 % and underestimations of up to - 62 %. It was therefore concluded that improvements in the current design procedures are required for a more accurate evaluation of wall shear loads in load-bearing masonry buildings subjected to the lateral loading...|$|R
40|$|The joint has not {{yet been}} applied offshore. Therefore two {{different}} aspects of the development of such a joint for offshore applications are considered, namely: 1. a simplified dynamic analysis of its installation under own weight with and without initial velocity, 2. a determination of its static capacities (axial and bending) in the in-place situation by means of a FE model. To circumvent current industry problems related to the settling of grouted connections, a steel-to-steel or <b>slip</b> <b>joint</b> connection is proposed for fitting a transition piece onto an installed monopile foundation. A <b>slip</b> <b>joint</b> consists of two conical sections, one attached {{to the top of the}} foundation pile and the other to the bottom of the transition piece. The dimensions of the two sections are chosen so as to have one fit closely inside the other in the same way as two inverted cups – see figure 1.

40|$|The {{differential}} {{movements are}} caused by brick growth, concrete shrinkage, and thermal expansion/contraction. In Australia, loadbearing unreinforced masonry is a common system of construction for "walk up" apartment buildingsup to five storeys. Although unreinforced masonry structuresgenerally perform poorly in seismically active areas,they are frequently used in Australia because Australia {{is located in a}} region with low to moderate seismic risk [Page (2002) ]. This form of construction creates a challenge for seismic design, as clear load paths need to be established for seismic forces despite the limited shear capacity of the <b>slip</b> <b>joints</b> whose design has been governed by serviceability requirements. For low to moderate earthquake loading (as for Australia), this can be achieved by the appropriate choice of <b>slip</b> <b>joint</b> material...|$|R

40|$|Loadbearing masonry {{construction}} is a building system composed of masonry walls and concrete slabs, with the masonry walls supporting the slabs and {{acting as the}} main structural element resisting the lateral loads from wind and earthquake. In Australian practice, these buildings usually incorporate <b>slip</b> <b>joints,</b> which are placed between the unreinforced masonry walls and concrete slabs, to allow for long term differential movements between {{the walls and the}} slabs. In some areas they also serve as a membrane type damp-proof-course. Loadbearing masonry buildings are often composed of reinforced concrete slabs and supporting masonry walls arranged in a cellular pattern. In Australia, these buildings usually incorporate <b>slip</b> <b>joints</b> in the interfaces between walls and slabs, to allow for long term relative displacements caused by brick growth, concrete shrinkage, and thermal expansion and contraction. A common application of this technique is for ''walk up" apartment buildings up to five storeys [Page (2002) ]. In this system of building, wind and earthquake actions are resisted by the floor slab acting as horizontal diaphragm in conjunction with the loadbearing walls. The load path therefore includes the <b>slip</b> <b>joints</b> at the wall-floor interface. The distribution of those actions among the walls of that building initially depends on the elastic stiffness and arrangement of the walls. However, once either softening of masonry or <b>slip</b> in the <b>joints</b> occurs, a redistribution of shear loads will result. The redistribution of shear is a complex process and is influenced by many factors, such as the nonlinear behaviour of masonry and <b>slip</b> <b>joints,</b> the compressive stress level in the walls, and the walls arrangement [Sing-Sang et al. (2006) ]. In asymmetrical buildings, the centre of mass does not coincide with the centre of wall stiffness. Hence, the lateral loading action tends to twist the building, and causes an increase of shear in the walls located at one side of the centre of stiffness, and a reduction of shear in the other walls. The building twisting also induces shear loading in the walls perpendicular to the lateral load direction. This behaviour may accelerate or delay the masonry softening and the <b>slip</b> in the <b>joints.</b> When either softening of masonry or <b>slip</b> in the <b>joints</b> occurs, the centre of wall stiffness will also change its position. Thus, during the loading process the effects of building torsion may change the shear distribution making the prediction of wall forces a very complex process...|$|R
