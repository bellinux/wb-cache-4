40|$|In {{order to}} protect Corsica as an origin for their production, some pig producers, {{generally}} practicing on-farm processing, created a syndicate for applying a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) for the dry cured ham named “prisuttu”. Even if their actual practices {{are close to the}} rules included into the specification, some difficulties may appear for being in compliance with the whole code of practices of the future PDO. Anticipating the official registration, we explored the possibility of a “blank” assessment with a sample of 6 producers throughout 43 already registered in the syndicate. On several batches of slaughtered pigs, we implemented a fraction of the control plan foreseen for the future PDO. The controls operated in our work concern the operations around slaughtering, from the finishing pigs to be slaughtered till the end of the <b>salting</b> <b>period</b> of hams. The step from the farm breeding the pigs to the process into typical products must be considered as key in production chain. We present and discuss the results we obtained.

40|$|Abstract The {{study of}} sodium and {{chloride}} {{in the environment}} {{has a long history}} with a particular focus on road salting in urban areas. In many studies, spatial scales are limited (e. g., city) and temporal measurements are coarse (e. g., monthly), with the result that our understanding of the hydrogeochemical dynamics is constrained. Through a unique set of spatial and temporal measurements from the State of Michigan we a) examine the spatial distribution of chloride across a broad geographic area, b) explore the temporal behavior of chloride and sodium over hydrologic events capturing snowmelt and rain through salting seasons, c) evaluate the use of chloride/sodium ratios as a tool for linking sources to concentrations, and d) develop a conceptual framework for processes responsible for their environmental concentrations. Results show 1) the short-term and local impact of urban areas on chloride concentrations is clearly delineated, 2) concentration and ratio variations over the hydrographs differ during <b>salting</b> and post-salting <b>periods,</b> 3) chloride/sodium ratios do not clearly indicate a halite source and can be very high (> 5) and this is interpreted to be due to the different environmental behaviors of the two ions, and 4) during <b>salting</b> <b>periods,</b> chloride and sodium are quickly removed from the landscape during first flush and diluted as event water begins to dominate, but in post <b>salting</b> <b>periods,</b> only chloride is diluted. We also find evidence for upwelling of brine in some locations. These two solutes are easily measured indicators of human influences on water quality and it is recommended that they routine be included in water quality assessments. However, we suggest more research is necessary to better understand their cycling on shorter time scales and then how this knowledge can be used to inform our understanding of other chemical cycles in the environment...|$|R

The hypertensive SHRSP and normotensive WKY strains were used in a speed congenic approach to confirm the existence of a QTL on rat chromosome 2. Systolic baseline and salt loaded blood pressures were measured by radiotelemetry. Transfer of the chromosome 2 blood pressure QTL region from WKY into an SHRSP background significantly reduced blood pressure, with the increased significance at the <b>salt</b> loaded <b>period,</b> compared to the SHRSP. The reciprocal congenic blood pressure showed a significantly increased baseline systolic pressure compared to the WKY, with no change in significance at the <b>salt</b> loaded <b>period.</b> Thus we have successfully captured a gene(s) which contribute to blood pressure regulation in both congenic strains.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A high sodium intake {{has been}} found to {{increase}} bronchial reactivity in men with asthma. The effects of change in sodium intake on peak flow rate have not been determined. METHODS: The effect of changing dietary salt intake for two weeks on the severity of asthma as measured by peak expiratory flow (PEF) was studied in 17 patients with mild asthma in an open randomised crossover trial. PEF measurements were made by the patients in their own homes. Patients were placed on three levels of dietary sodium intake: normal, low, and high. Sodium intake was assessed by 24 hour urine collection. RESULTS: The mean (SD) urine sodium was 147 (45), 84 (32), and 201 (73) mmol/ 24 hours in the normal, low, and high sodium intake periods respectively. There {{were no significant differences in}} PEF or PEF amplitude (highest [...] lowest PEF), an index of asthma lability, between the three dietary <b>salt</b> <b>periods.</b> CONCLUSION A low and high dietary salt intake for two weeks has no effect on peak expiratory flow in patients with mild asthma...|$|R

A total of 84 fresh ham samples (pH= 5. 6 – 5. 9 measured 24 h post mortem) originating from pigs (Landrace × Large white) were divided into subgroups according to mass (light, 9. 5 – 10. 5 kg vs. heavy, 11. 5 – 13. 0 kg) and salt addition during production (normal vs. low salt). These formed four subgroups for the analyses: light and normally salted, light and low salt, heavy and normally salted, and heavy and low salt. After the <b>salting</b> <b>period,</b> the NaCl concentration in the normally salted muscles was 3. 8 to 4. 0 %, and in the less salted muscles 2. 8 to 3. 0 %. During the processing of the dry-cured ham (at the beginning, after salting, and after resting), the semimembranosus (SM) and biceps femoris (BF) muscles were analysed for water activity (aw), pH, salt content, moisture, total minerals, non-protein nitrogen, and total nitrogen. One year after the processing, the instrumental (stress relaxation and texture profile) and sensory qualities were also analysed. After the salting and resting periods, the pH of the samples was significantly decreased in comparison with the fresh ham, although after ageing period this increased again, to reach nearly the initial values (pH= 5. 59 – 5. 74). At the same time, the aw of both muscles in all experimental groups dropped below 0. 90. The total mass losses varied between the groups (34. 75 – 36. 63 %), with the samples of heavy and low salt ham showing the greatest mass loss. The light and low salt SM muscles showed slightly higher proteolysis indices (non-protein nitrogen/total nitrogen ratio) after one year, which indicated a trend towards more rapid proteolysis as compared to the normally salted hams. Generally, the softer texture of the BF muscle compared to the SM muscle was confirmed by stress relaxation test, texture profile analysis, and the related chemical parameters (higher moisture content, aw, and proteolysis index). As for the effect of salt on the texture parameters, the SM muscle from the light and low salt ham samples showed greater softness (stress relaxation test), and lower hardness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness and resilience (texture profile analysis) than those from the normally salted hams; the BF muscle showed similar trends to those of the SM muscle. In contrast, the heavy ham samples showed higher values of almost all of the instrumental texture parameters in the low salt hams as compared to the normally salted hams. Significant differences in the majority of the ham sensory traits were mainly due to the differences between the SM and BF muscles...|$|E

In order to evaluate the changes of preserved egg white during its <b>salted</b> <b>period,</b> sulfhydryl group, disulfide bond contents, and surface hydrophobicity were measured. Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy and circular dichroism analysis were performed by considering changes of the secondary structural elements, the protein components of egg white was also studied in more detail by electrophoresis. Results showed that the sulfhydryl group and surface hydrophobicity were increased with increasing salting time, whereas a decrease in the disulfide bond contents was observed. Regarding the secondary structure analysis, a decrease in a-helices and b-turns were accompanied by increases in b-sheets and random coils, which indicating a decrease in non-random structure while ever increasing of unordered structure. Electrophoresis shows no significant differences in protein patterns among fresh egg white and samples salting for up to 4 days. Disappearance of most protein was at the 5 th day. Single band of ovalbumin can be readily observed from the 6 th day to the ripening period finished.

In this study we sought whether the urinary excretion rate of this autacoid is related to salt intake and by the expected changes in arterial pressure in patients with mild essential hypertension. The influence of salt intake on the renal excretion of ADM was investigated in 55 hypertensive patients in a double blind, randomized and crossover study comparing a 2 -week 50 mmol/day <b>salt</b> intake <b>period</b> with a 150 mmol/day <b>salt</b> intake <b>period.</b> Twenty-four-hour ADM and endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) excretion rate were measured by radioimmunoassay on preextracted urinary samples (intraassay confidence variable < 8 %). The antibodies used in these assays had minimal ADM-ET- 1 cross-reactivity (< 1 %). Twenty-four-hour microalbuminuria was measured by nephelometry. On univariate analysis changes in urinary ADM were significantly related to those in salt excretion (r = 0. 33, P =. 01) as well as to changes in urinary ET- 1 (r = 0. 56, P =. 0001). Furthermore, changes in urinary albumin excretion were related to those in urinary ET- 1 (r = 0. 26, P =. 05), but were independent of those in urinary ADM (P =. 19). In a multiple regression model including age, sex, body mass index, and changes in systolic pressure, plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone and urine volume, salt excretion resulted as the stronger independent predictor of urinary ADM (r = 0. 33, P =. 01). However, changes in urinary salt lost prediction power (P =. 11) for urinary ADM when urinary ET- 1 was introduced into the model. In this model (multiple r = 0. 31) urinary ET- 1 resulted to be the only independent predictor of urinary ADM (beta = 0. 56, P =. 0001). This study is the first to show that the renal excretion of ADM is related to changes in salt intake and that it is tightly linked to that of ET- 1. The data support the notion that these autacoids play a role in the regulation of sodium metabolism in patients with mild hypertension. The intercorrelations between ET- 1, ADM, and microalbuminuria are compatible with the hypothesis that ET- 1 is involved in a salt-induced increase in glomerular pressure and suggest that ADM may act as a counterregulatory factor in this situation...|$|R

Each treatment group had ten replications across sites and treatments, to test the null hypothesis that there is no difference in putrefaction due to different levels of <b>salt,</b> stocking <b>periods</b> and altitude. Therefore, a total of 3 x 3 x 5 x 10, or 450 individual skins were used in the trial. The experimental skins were collected from the major central market in Addis Ababa, and were randomly allocated to the three sites. The proportion of skin area putrefied (%) was used as the response variable. The results of the aggregate analysis for the three sites showed that the proportion of skin area putrefied differed highly significantly (P< 0. 0001) between sites, salt levels and stocking periods. The largest overall least squares mean putrefaction proportion of 17. 15 % was observed in Metehara, followed by 5. 05 % for Debre Zeit and 0. 39 % for Debre Birhan. The interaction of site with salt levels was found to be very highly significant, which led to separate analysis of the data by site. The results showed that in Metehara up to 40 % salt level is required to meaningfully arrest putrefaction in preserved sheepskin for stocking periods of up to 60 days. For Debre Zeit and similar agro-ecological areas, a salt level of 30 % suffices to provide similar protection. For areas like Debre Birhan, and possibly those at higher altitudes, salt levels between 20 and 30 % provide adequate preservative for up to 60 days...|$|R
40|$|One {{the most}} serious health hazards of aging and of long term space flight {{is the loss of}} bone. The most {{important}} determinant of the debilitation due to bone loss is the peak bone mass achieved during late adolescence, which itself may be influenced by gender and environmental factors such as mineral balance. Sodium intake is considered a risk factor for both hypertension and osteoporosis. It is estimated that 30 - 60 % of the population is hypertensive and 30 - 40 % of the population is salt sensitive. The primary purpose of the present studies was to both delineate and combine the effects between salt intake and salt sensitive hypertensive genotype on bone. Our hypothesis was that hypertensive rats would have more severely affected bone than normotensive rats due to salt supplementation and/or genotype. In addition, how these effects might be altered by immobilization/overloading stress was examined as this further burdens NASA space pioneers. This study investigated the possible effects of an ad libidum 1 % or 2 % saline instead of water on the normotensive (W) and salt sensitive hypertensive (SS) young female rats. A total of 46 weight-matched female rats (7 weeks old) were used. Treated rats in the 1 % study drank 1 % saline ad libitum for a 42 day <b>salt</b> supplementation <b>period,</b> beginning at day 7 (after arrival) to day 49. Treated rats in the 2 % study drank 2 % saline ad libitum for a 42 day <b>salt</b> supplementation <b>period,</b> beginning at day 7 (after arrival) to day 49. The right hindlimb of each animal was immobilized by binding to the abdomen with 4 layers of elastic bandage tape, the hip joint in flexion and the knee and ankle joint in extension for the 42 day <b>salt</b> experimental <b>period.</b> Body weight and urine volume was measured biweekly. Food and fluid intake was monitored daily. After sacrifice, three sites (both the underloaded and the overloaded tibiae, as well as the L- 2 vertebrae) were processed for histomorphometric analysis. The wet weight (g) and length (mm) of the excised right immobilized and left overloaded femur and the ulna were measured. A 3 -point bending test was applied to femurs only. Immediately after the femur breaking strength measurements, bone was cut transversely, one mm from breaking point (fracture location), and a 1. 0 mm cross-section was cut for morphological measurement. In addition, a 5 mm high cylinder section from each femur was cut and used for bone composition measurements along with the right ulna bone. A number of elements were analyzed at one time with Induced Coupled Plasma (ICP) spectrometry. The systolic blood pressure and heart rate were measured in the 6 th week of study by the tail-cuff sphygmomanometer method. A more robust result was seen with increased concentration of saline treatment from a 1 % saline threshold level, to the 2 % saline level. Using two-way ANOVA, both hypertensive genotype and 2 % saline treatment significantly increased blood pressure and heart rate, and decreased femur magnesium. The SS rat had significant reductions in bone mass, femur cross-sectional area and zinc concentrations with simultaneous elevations in femur stiffness, strength and calcium concentrations. Two percent saline treatment markedly increased both blood pressure and heart rate and decreased both femurs magnesium and cancellous bone in the weight-bearing tibia bone. After 6 weeks of immobilization (to simulate space weightlessness), reductions in cancellous tibia bone volume, with elevations in femur bone stiffness, mineral concentration (calcium and phosphorus) and in trace elements (zinc and manganese) were found in the underloaded femur. Our findings suggest genotype, and saline treatment, and immobilization adversely affect bone in adolescent female rats.

5|$|Some of the {{earliest}} evidence of salt processing dates to around 8,000 years ago, when {{people living in the}} area of present-day Romania boiled spring water to extract salts; a salt-works in China dates to approximately the same <b>period.</b> <b>Salt</b> was also prized by the ancient Hebrews, the Greeks, the Romans, the Byzantines, the Hittites, Egyptians, and the Indians. Salt became an important article of trade and was transported by boat across the Mediterranean Sea, along specially built salt roads, and across the Sahara on camel caravans. The scarcity and universal need for salt have led nations to go to war over it and use it to raise tax revenues. Salt is used in religious ceremonies and has other cultural significance.|$|R

40|$|A {{functionally}} coupled organotypic {{complex of}} cultured dorsal root ganglia, spinal cord peripheral nerve, and muscle has been employed in an experimental {{approach to the}} investigation of the neurotoxic effects of thallium. Selected cultures, grown for up to 12 wk in vitro, were exposed to thallous <b>salts</b> for <b>periods</b> ranging up to 4 days. Cytopathic effects were first detected after 2 h of exposure with the appearance of considerably enlarged mitochondria in axons of peripheral nerve fibers. With time, the matrix space of these mitochondria became progressively swollen, transforming the organelle into an axonal vacuole bounded by the original outer mitochondrial membrane. Coalescence of adjacent axonal vacuoles produced massive internal axon compartments, the membranes of which were shown by electron microprobe mass spectrometry to have an affinity for thallium. Other axoplasmic components were displaced within a distended but intact axolemma. The resultant fiber swelling caused myelin retraction from nodes of Ranvier but no degeneration. Impulses could still propagate along the nerve fibers throughout the time course of the experiment. Comparable, but less severe changes were seen in dorsal root ganglion neurons and in central nerve fibers. Other cell types showed no mitochondrial change. It is uncertain how these findings relate to the neurotoxic effects of thallium in vivo, but a sensitivity of the nerve cell and especially its axon to thallous salts is indicated...|$|R
