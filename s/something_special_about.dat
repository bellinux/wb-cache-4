5|$|There's <b>something</b> <b>special</b> <b>about</b> {{that first}} single, {{we were never}} quite able to {{recapture}} that sound. I don't {{know if it was}} the guitars or the recording. It was just a really gnarly, gnarly guitar sound. We've gotten some since, but they've been a different kind. I think it {{had more to do with}} the actual electromagnetic chemistry of what was going through our amps that day. It was just a cool, fried-out sound.|$|E
500|$|Most of Hoffman's notable roles came in {{independent}} films, including particularly original ones, {{but he also}} featured in several Hollywood blockbusters.

2500|$|A digital brain with human-level {{intelligence}} raises many philosophical questions, {{the first}} of which is whether it is conscious. Kurzweil feels that consciousness is [...] "an emergent property of a complex physical system", such that a computer emulating a brain would have the same emergent consciousness as the real brain. This is in contrast to people like John Searle, Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose who believe there is <b>something</b> <b>special</b> <b>about</b> the physical brain that a computer version could not duplicate.|$|E

50|$|My {{aim is to}} {{communicate}} something of {{the spirit and the}} mentality of the English, their habits and their way of life, the ironies that exist in the way they do things, partly through their traditions and partly through the nature of their environment and their mentality. For me there is <b>something</b> very <b>special</b> <b>about</b> the English 'way of life' and I wish to record it from my particular point of view before it becomes Americanised and disappears.|$|R

40|$|The heated {{scholarly}} and public {{debate on the}} Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) has centred predominantly on two questions. Firstly, is there <b>something</b> particularly <b>special</b> <b>about</b> TTIP, {{other than the fact}} that it involves the world’s largest trading partners? And, secondly, is the concern about TTIP’s deleterious effects justified? The starting point for our argument is that understanding an agreement like TTIP requires an emphasis on the socially constructed nature of reality. TTIP is ultimately novel in terms of the regulatory scope of its provisions and it is problematic because it subtly promotes the (socially constructed) interests of those who merely see regulation as inefficient ‘red tape’...|$|R

5000|$|The AllMusic {{review by}} Dave Lynch said [...] "there is <b>something</b> very <b>special</b> <b>about</b> the three JMT CDs by the Bloodcount band ... In {{the first of}} the three, Lowlife, a searching quality tends to {{dominate}} the three lengthy tracks, as the band usually takes its time reaching explicit statements of Berne's (and Julius Hemphill's) thematic material. The music even meanders, but such a description shouldn't be put in a negative light. The band is in no hurry as it investigates Berne's sonic world, but is never reduced to aimless noodling; the musicians' improvisations remain too close to theme, melody, and mode -- or compelling abstraction -- for that".|$|R
5000|$|Opposition to closure plans began {{immediately}} after {{the announcement of the}} planned closure, in 2000 when pilots claimed that closing this air field would be a loss of infrastructure that would never be replaced.

The position of general aviation advocates and lobbyists is that there is <b>something</b> very <b>special</b> <b>about</b> airplanes, and to lose them in Chapel Hill for the sake of more buildings, traffic and population density must be carefully considered.|$|R

5000|$|Gopnik {{has done}} {{extensive}} work with applying Bayesian networks to human learning and has published and presented numerous {{papers on the}} topic. Gopnik says of this work, [...] "The interesting thing about Bayes nets is that they search out causes rather than mere associations. They give you a single representational structure for dealing both with things that just happen and with interventions--things you observe others doing to the world or things you do to the world. This is important because there is <b>something</b> really <b>special</b> <b>about</b> the way we treat and understand human action. We give it a special status {{in terms of our}} causal inferences. We think of human actions as things that you do that are designed to change things in the world as opposed to other events that just take place." ...|$|R
