5|$|Previous authors (Kristjánsson cites Joel Feinberg, Alan Wertheimer and Robert Nozick) {{provided}} {{moral and}} <b>statistical</b> <b>analyses</b> of various thought experiments {{to determine whether}} the proposals they involve are threats or offers. On Kristjánsson's account, by contrast, all of the thought experiments considered are throffers. Instead, he argues, the previous thinkers' analyses attempted to differentiate offers that limit freedom from those that do not. They conflate two tasks, that of differentiating threats and offers and that of differentiating freedom-restricting threats from non-freedom-restricting threats. He concludes that the thinkers' methods are also inadequate for determining the difference between freedom-restricting and non-freedom-restricting threats, for which a test of moral responsibility would be required.|$|E

In contrast, while there are significant phylogenetic divergences between communities from freshwater and marine habitats, the underlying mechanisms to this phylogenetic structuring yet remain unknown. We hypothesized that the functional potential of natural bacterial communities is linked to this striking divide between microbiomes. To test this hypothesis, metagenomic sequencing of microbial communities along a 1, 800 km transect in the Baltic Sea area, encompassing a continuous natural salinity gradient from limnic to fully marine conditions, was explored.

40|$|When evaluators plan site-randomized experiments, {{they must}} conduct the {{appropriate}} <b>statistical</b> power <b>analyses.</b> These analyses {{are most likely}} to be valid when they are based on data from the jurisdictions in which the studies are to be conducted. In this method note, we provide software code, in the form of a SAS macro, for producing <b>statistical</b> power <b>analyses</b> using such data. The macro is designed to estimate statistical parameters for multiple school subjects and multiple grades in a single computer run. Among other convenient features, the macro calculates intraclass correlation coefficient confidence intervals, which are essential for planning studies conservatively. We also provide a SAS macro for calculating benchmarks–again, using locally-based–data for inter-preting the feasibility of achieving the minimum detectable effect sizes that are calculated in <b>statistical</b> power <b>analyses.</b> The benchmarks are potentially useful for interpreting the meaning of the effect sizes that are achieved in completed studies, as well. We describe the macros, describe how we ver-ified their accuracy, show how they can be useful to education evaluators, and give examples of their use with statewide educational assessment data. It is our hope that the macros will help evaluators use local data when conducting group-randomized studies...|$|R

25|$|Following the {{dissemination}} of the concept, character displacement was viewed as an important force in structuring ecological communities, and biologists identified numerous examples. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, however, the role of competition and character displacement in structuring communities was questioned and its importance greatly downgraded. Many found the early examples unconvincing and suggested {{it to be a}} rare phenomenon. Criticisms with earlier studies included the lack of rigor in <b>statistical</b> <b>analyses</b> and the use of poorly rationalized characters. Additionally, theory seemed to indicate that the conditions that allowed character displacement to occur were limited. This scrutiny helped motivate theoretical and methodological advances as well as the development of a more rigorous framework for testing character displacement.|$|E
