40|$|Using {{a variety}} of tools is a common and {{essential}} component of modern human life. Patients with brain damage or neurological disorders frequently have cognitive deficits in their recognition and manipulation of tools. In this study, we focused on improving tool-related cognition using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Converging evidence from neuropsychology, neuroimaging and non- invasive brain stimulation has identified the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) and inferior parietal lobule (IPL) as brain regions supporting action semantics. We observed enhanced performance in tool cognition with anodal tDCS over ATL and IPL in two cognitive tasks that require rapid access to semantic knowledge about the function or manipulation of common <b>tools.</b> <b>ATL</b> stimulation improved access to both function and manipulation knowledge of tools. The effect of IPL stimulation showed a trend toward better manipulation judgments.

5000|$|Recently, {{the social}} work {{profession}} has begun adopting cultural humility into frameworks for service delivery and practice. Most cultural humility rhetoric focuses on interpersonal, individual micro practice social work [...] in terms of worker/client relationships and culturally appropriate intervention procedures. However, social work posits cultural humility as a strong <b>self-reflection</b> <b>tool</b> for the worker. Most importantly, it encourages social workers to realize their own power, privilege and prejudices, and be willing to accept that acquired education and credentials alone are insufficient to address social inequality.As such, this reflective practice, enables social workers to understand that the client is an expert in their own lives and {{that it is not the}} role of the worker to lean on their own understanding.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{that there are}} two important views of Model Driven Engineering. One consists in starting with a well known standard universal modeling language like UML 2. 0 and to define restrictions and extensions to this all-purpose language by the way of so-called &quot;profiles&quot;. The other possibility consists in using small, well-focused Domain Specific Languages and to deal with the coordination between these. We will not discuss here {{the pros and cons of}} both approaches but we will consider that each has many supporters while the debate is going on. UML CASE tools currently produce a significant legacy, mainly of UML profiles. Bridges between both modeling worlds will surely be most needed in the future. We consider this bridging problem to be a hard one and we propose to use some advanced modeling tools to solve it. We show how a combination of a model-transformation <b>tool</b> (<b>ATL)</b> and a model-weaving tool (AMW) may help solving this problem. We also show how to take advantage of higherorder transformations in this endeavor...|$|R

40|$|Existing {{research}} into work-related stress highlights that {{working as a}} therapist can be challenging. Evident across both qualified and trainee therapists, work-related stress can impact upon {{the quality of care}} provided. Practising psychotherapy can often result in difficulties for the therapist, which if unresolved can negatively impact upon therapist wellbeing and impede therapeutic process for the client. Ideally, therapists would have access to quality clinical supervision however literature suggests repeated evidence of a failure to adhere to best practice guidelines. Consequently, therapists are left to manage their difficulties independently, which may lead them to personal therapy. Reflective practice enables therapists to examine their experiences with clients and to consider the emotional impact of their work in order to gain insight into the self, the client and the overall therapeutic process. There is no existing literature related to therapists’ reflective practice in relation to their experience of therapist difficulties. Study aims This study aimed to explore therapists’ experiences of using a <b>self-reflection</b> <b>tool</b> (SRT) to reflect upon difficulties encountered in their clinical practice, their emotional experience and coping strategies, which may serve to increase therapists’ ability to manage difficulties in practice and reduce occurrence of work-related stress and associated negative consequences for client care. Page 3 of 241 Methods Informed by a pragmatic worldview this study utilised a mixed method, intrinsic (Stake, 2005), multiple case study design (Luck, Jackson & Usher, 2006). Opportunistic sampling recruited three qualified and three trainee therapists. Therapists attended an initial semi-structured interview before completing the <b>self-reflection</b> <b>tool</b> (SRT) as and when they experienced a difficulty within their clinical practice for a period of six weeks, alongside a measure of emotional impact and wellbeing, before attending a second semi-structured interview. Inductive and deductive qualitative and quantitative analyses were conducted. Results The qualitative and quantitative data was organised into two broad categories: 1) therapist experience, which included the themes therapist difficulties and therapist wellbeing and 2) therapist activity, which included the themes coping, reflective practice and clinical supervision. Discussion The findings yield implications for clinical practice in terms of reflective practice, clinical supervision and training courses. The SRT would benefit from further research to determine its practical use {{over a longer period of}} time, subsequent to revision following feedback obtained in the study. Furthermore, obtaining the client’s perspective of the difficulties would strengthen our understanding of the value of reflective practice in improving therapeutic outcome...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - This paper aims to {{investigate}} how health care accreditation surveyors enact their role {{with a view}} to identifying a surveyor styles typology. Design/methodology/approach - This study was conducted in two phases. First, observational research was used to examine the conduct of a small survey team during the 2005 accreditation survey of a rural health service in Australia. The survey team was from the Australian Council on Healthcare Standards (ACHS), the major health care accreditation agency in Australia. Second, the emerging typology was reviewed by an expert panel of ACHS surveyors. Findings - A typology comprising three unique surveyor styles is identified - interrogator; explorer; and discusser. Additionally, a further style, the questioner, is hypothesised. Research limitation/implications - The typology has application for development by accreditation agencies to be used with surveyors as a <b>self-reflection</b> <b>tool</b> to improve learning and development. The knowledge gained about surveyors' styles can be used to match more effectively survey teams to organisations seeking accreditation. Further research is necessary to confirm these styles and examine whether other styles are apparent. Originality/value - This study is an important step in examining the conduct of surveyors and opening up health care accreditation surveyor inter-rater reliability for further investigation. 9 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Background:  The {{health and}} social {{inequity}} experienced by the Indigenous population of Australia {{has resulted in the}} establishment of a national priority to close the gap in health outcomes. The occupational therapy profession is being urged to ensure the cultural appropriateness of practice interventions for Indigenous people. Although the importance of practice modification has been recognised by the occupational therapy profession, minimal research has been conducted in relation to older Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations. Method:  The aim {{of this study was to}} explore occupational therapists' views of their effectiveness when practising with Indigenous clients. The qualitative study utilises in-depth interviews with occupational therapists working in a regional centre of North Queensland to explore their views of effectiveness when modifying interventions for Indigenous clients. Results:  Inductive thematic analysis of the descriptive data generated four themes. The first theme provides insights into participants' views of effectiveness when providing interventions to Indigenous clients. The remaining themes identify specific modification as (i) awareness of culture and respect for the individual, (ii) developing different expectations and (iii) ensuring equality of outcomes. Conclusion:  The study supports the importance of modifying practice to provide culturally safe occupational therapy to Indigenous clients. The importance of adopting a client-centred approach in modifying interventions is also highlighted. Self-reflection by the therapist regarding their occupational therapy practice with Indigenous clients is strongly suggested. In response, a <b>self-reflection</b> <b>tool</b> has been developed from the findings of the study...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a project which was {{conducted}} within the ‘Programa Institucional de Bolsa de Iniciação à Docência’ (PIBID), a national programme in Brazil to promote teacher recruitment and encourage undergraduate students {{to pursue a career}} in teaching. The study investigated the pedagogical experiences of pre-service L 1 Portuguese teachers working in state schools located in peripheral urban areas in São Paulo. Specifically, it examined the ways these student teachers conceptualised their pedagogical contexts and how this informed the development of appropriate pedagogies, with a view to supporting their professional development, improving the quality of teaching in these contexts, and informing the revision of teacher education programmes in Brazil. The study was exploratory-interpretive and took the form of a multi-site, multiple-case design. Four case studies of individual pre-service teachers were conducted in three different state schools. The project involved a multimodal approach to data collection, including, where appropriate, an ecological use of methods which were already adopted as part of the PIBID programme. The primary methods of data collection were autobiographical accounts (using a <b>self-reflection</b> <b>tool),</b> photo-driven interviews (based on pictures of the context taken by the participants), teacher diaries, and retrospective interviews (using lesson plans designed by the student teachers). The findings show that, informed by their personal and prior educational history, the student teachers experienced tensions, confusion, difficulties and insights as they attempted both to make sense of their new pedagogical contexts and of the role of teaching and themselves as language teachers, and to develop pedagogies which were appropriate for such contexts. This provides evidence of the process pre-service teachers undergo during their initial teaching engagement and its impact on their professional identity formation. These results contribute to our theoretical understanding of the complex relationships among experience, cognition, context and practice involved in pre-service teachers' professional development...|$|R

Presentation of the concepts of loss and grief as an interactive education tool may help those who live with chronic pain gain {{a deeper understanding of}} their condition. This in turn may enable more effective management of their pain. This study aims to explore the effectiveness of such a tool through the perceptions and experiences of people with living chronic pain. Methods: an interactive pain education tool was developed and distributed with an evaluation questionnaire. Participants were invited to re-evaluate the tool three months later. Responses to the questionnaire were provided using a Likert scale and free text comments. Descriptive statistics were used to present quantitative results and inductive thematic analysis was applied to the free text comments. Results: the pain education tool was well received by participants, the majority of whom found the process of using the tool a positive experience. Responses showed the tool helped participants express themselves and promoted <b>self-reflection.</b> The <b>tool</b> provided access to the reflections of others, which helped validate and legitimise their feelings and gain the understanding their response to pain was normal. This in turn helped promote self-compassion and a sense of belonging, reducing feelings of isolation associated with chronic pain. Conclusions: the outcomes of this study show the pain education tool can help individuals gain a new and more positive perspective on themselves and their pain experience, therefore helping them live with and manage their chronic pain. <br/...|$|R
40|$|This {{work has}} also be {{published}} {{under the title}} "Constructivism in Physics Knowledge". The author of this work has given permission to provide it open access to the public. Constructivism is a concept and methodology debated and applied {{for many years in}} education. According to this concept, knowledge is built in learners' minds through experimentation and reflection. Communicating and negotiating in communities over what, how, and why to learn defines social constructivism. There has been limited {{research in the area of}} constructing knowledge in competitions. This dissertation answered three research questions: how was the competitive learning environment constructivist, how did students construct physics knowledge during competition, and what were the perceptions of judges and coaches regarding constructivist learning in competition. To address Research Question I and Research Question 2 the methodology employed in this study was the non-participant observational model. To address Research Question 3 the methodology employed in this study was a statistical analysis of the data collected from the Physics Competition Learning Inventory (PCLI) survey administered to coaches and judges. The PCLI was developed to provide school and district administrators, science supervisors, and science and physics teachers an opportunity to reflect upon their own perceptions of radical constructivist learning in physics competitions. From the non-participant observational model, the researcher discerned several constructivist themes using videotapes, transcripts, and observer notes. The results of this analysis clearly showed that a constructivist learning process occurred in the Yale Physics Olympics (YPO). The statistical analysis of the PCLI, using the categories of Group Interaction in the Community of Physics Competitors (Overall Mean for coaches, 5. 10 and for judges, 5. 08) and Learning Activities for Physics Competitors (Overall Mean for coaches, 4. 24 and for judges, 4. 53), with a scale from zero to six, confirmed a strong constructivist learning environment in the YPO as demonstrated by the application of the non-participant observational meth 0 d. Using the variation coefficient, the means of all items from the PCLI were representative except for one item, the training of students before competition, which clearly showed two tendencies for training students, a mild and a radical constructivism. The Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient showed a very strong correlation between ranking of coaches and judges for the CPLI Group Interaction in the Community of Physics Competitors (r = 0. 90, p < 0. 05) and for the CPLI Learning Activities for Physics Competitors (r = 0. 95, p < 0. 05). Both coaches and judges were in agreement that Group Interaction in the Community of Physics Competitors (overall Means 5. 10 and 5. 08) was more constructivist than Learning Activities for Physics Competitors (overall Means 4. 24 and 4. 53). The results of this study generated several recommendations. Additional research should be done with a larger sample of students participating in the YPO. High school teachers should apply constructivist learning principles used in the YPO competition, by using video and audio tapes as training materials. A similar study should be conducted to determine the degree to which constructivist learning is occurring in other academic competitions. The results should also be used to initiate changes in the way school districts see the construction of knowledge in competitions as well as the way in which curricula are developed to reflect this new radical learning process. The PCLI may be a useful <b>self-reflection</b> <b>tool</b> because it reveals patterns of strengths and areas of need in developing interesting, exciting, and motivational learning activities.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Domestic {{violence}} {{is a serious problem}} affecting the health and wellbeing of women globally. Interventions in health care settings have primarily focused on screening and referral, however, women often may not disclose abuse to health practitioners. The internet offers a confidential space in which women can assess the health of their relationships and make a plan for safety and wellbeing for themselves and their children. This randomised controlled trial is testing the effectiveness of a web-based healthy relationship tool and safety decision aid (I-DECIDE). Based broadly on the IRIS trial in the United States, it has been adapted for the Australian context where it is conducted entirely online and uses the Psychosocial Readiness Model {{as the basis for the}} intervention. METHODS/DESIGN: In this two arm, pragmatic randomised controlled trial, women who have experienced abuse or fear of a partner in the previous 6  months will be computer randomised to receive either the I-DECIDE website or a comparator website (basic relationship and safety advice). The intervention includes self-directed reflection exercises on their relationship, danger level, priority setting, and results in an individualised, tailored action plan. Primary self-reported outcomes are: self-efficacy (General Self-Efficacy Scale) immediately after completion, 6 and 12  months post-baseline; and depressive symptoms (Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, Revised, 6 and 12  months post-baseline). Secondary outcomes include mean number of helpful actions for safety and wellbeing, mean level of fear of partner and cost-effectiveness. DISCUSSION: This fully-automated trial will evaluate a web-based self-information, <b>self-reflection</b> and self-management <b>tool</b> for domestic violence. We hypothesise that the improvement in self-efficacy and mental health will be mediated by increased perceived support and awareness encouraging positive change. If shown to be effective, I-DECIDE could be easily incorporated into the community sector and health care settings, providing an alternative to formal services for women not ready or able to acknowledge abuse and access specialised services.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} explanation and reflection {{in mathematics and}} offers an instructional intervention for supporting student learning. Explanation and reflection are considered hallmarks of deep understanding; they are also tools for promoting learning. The primary context of study was calculus, because it is often considered a gatekeeper that prevents students from accessing higher-level mathematics and Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) careers. Simultaneously, there is concern that even students who are successful (in the conventional sense) lack deep mathematical understanding. I collected both conventional and deeper performance measures, because both have implications for learning and performance. Over three semesters of instruction I used design-based research methods to iteratively develop and refine an intervention. The intervention, Peer-Assisted Reflection (PAR), used peer-review and self-reflection as means to promote explanations. The core PAR activities required students to: (1) engage in meaningful problems, (2) reflect on their own work, (3) analyze a peer's work and give and receive feedback, and finally (4) revise their own work based on insights gained throughout this cycle. PAR was supported by {{other aspects of the}} instructional environment, such as adequate training and opportunities for students to explain their ideas regularly during class sessions. The first semester (pilot study) took place in an introductory algebra classroom in a community college; the second and third semesters (Phases I and II) took place in an introductory college calculus course in a research university. The purpose of the pilot study was to refine theoretical principles to create an effective instructional intervention. Phase I was the first full implementation of the intervention, and Phase II served to replicate and extend the findings from Phase I. During Phases I and II quasi-experimental methods were used to compare students in an experimental section to students in parallel sections of the same course. I collected the following data: students' common exams, pre- and post-surveys about beliefs, student interviews, video observations of class sessions, copies of students' PAR assignments, and audio records of student conversations. Students in the experimental sections were more successful in calculus than their counterparts in the comparison sections. During Phase I the experimental success rate (A's, B's, and C's in the course) was 13 % higher than the comparison section. The difference in success was 23 % during Phase II, due to iterative refinements of the intervention. These improvements were statistically significant on common department exams in Phase I (average exam score 73. 03 % vs. 66. 84 % and 67. 32 % in the two comparison conditions) and Phase II (average exam score 75. 20 % vs. 64. 17 %). Improvements were evident on both conceptual and procedural problems. Students in the experimental sections also improved their written explanations and demonstrated improved persistence in problem solving. In sum, engaging in PAR helped students improve their: success rates, exam scores, written explanations, and persistence. Because PAR is not grounded in specific mathematical (or formal) content, it should be a broadly applicable intervention for improving student learning in a variety of contexts. The findings of this dissertation also contribute to a theoretical understanding of peer-analysis and <b>self-reflection</b> as <b>tools</b> to promote explanations. For example, explaining to an authentic peer audience helped students focus on their communication, rather than just finding the correct answer. The findings also provide further evidence of the importance of conceptual understanding; by engaging in PAR, an intervention specifically targeted at improving explanations, students also improved their success on measures of procedural understanding...|$|R
40|$|This study directs {{attention}} to Sport New Zealand’s vision of having world leading coach development. In their quest Sport New Zealand has {{moved away from}} the structured accreditation system embraced by other leading sporting nations and adopted ‘on-going learning’ and ‘professional development’ framework. As part of this framework there is a key emphasis on self-reflection. The systematic and structured process of self-reflection is vital for coaches to become self-aware and develop their coaching. The use of video has been suggested as a tool that could enhance the reflective process. However, while there is considerable research on the benefits of video self-reflection (VSR) in both the education and coach development sectors, there remains limited research in understanding it’s use by coaches in New Zealand and to date there are no published studies that have used a qualitative research approach to understand how performance coaches in New Zealand engage in VSR. Drawing on data from interviews with New Zealand performance coaches this qualitative descriptive study looks to understand their perception of VSR as a tool for learning within their ‘on-going’ development. This study also looks to examine what are the potential barriers experienced by coaches to engaging in VSR. The six participants (one male and five female) were from four different sports (basketball, rugby, netball and football). Each participant was classified as a Performance coach, had coached for over 5 years in their particular sport and had recently (in the previous 12 months) participated in a coach development programme that aligned with the Sport NZ’s Coach Development Framework. The study data was gathered through semi-structured interviews. Four main themes emerged from the data: A positive perception of the benefits of engaging in VSR, a desire to engage in VSR which is not realised, perceived barriers to VSR (prioritization of time, logistics and self confrontation), and ‘modern’ vs. ‘old school’ coaches. The main finding of the study was that Sport New Zealand’s coach development philosophy has had an influential role on coach’s perceptions and awareness of the benefits of video <b>self-reflection</b> as a <b>tool</b> for learning. However while coach’s valued VSR the lack of exposure and experience in the process meant coaches did not value the practise enough to dedicate specific time towards it. The results of this study provide an evidence-base {{that can be used to}} support Sport New Zealand’s Coach Development Framework (CDF), and the modification of content to encourage the use of VSR and the goal of creating a world leading coach development programme...|$|R
