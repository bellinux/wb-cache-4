500|$|MDOT has {{highlighted}} five historic bridges {{along the}} route of M-28 on the MDOT website. In Interior Township, Ontonagon County, the highway crosses the Ontonagon River over a bridge built in 1929. [...] Designed by the State Highway Department and built by the firm of Meads and Anderson, the Ontonagon River Bridge {{is one of only}} three steel arch bridges in Michigan. The main <b>span</b> <b>arch</b> is [...] long. A former routing of M-28 in Covington Township crosses the Rock River. Although this section was bypassed by a new alignment of the trunkline in 1924, the bridge remains complete [...] "with corbeled bulkheads and six panels recessed in the concrete spandrel walls." [...] The corbels and spandrels are decorative features found in the concrete sides of the bridge.|$|E
2500|$|The Liverpool and Manchester Railway Company {{was founded}} on 24 May 1823. The [...] line was a {{remarkable}} engineering achievement for its time, beginning with the [...] Wapping Tunnel beneath Liverpool from the docks to Edge Hill. Following this was a [...] long cutting, up to [...] deep, through rock at Olive Mount, and a nine [...] <b>span</b> <b>arch</b> viaduct over the Sankey Brook Valley, around [...] high. There was also a [...] crossing of the Chat Moss bog.|$|E
2500|$|The {{bridge is}} an open-spandrel, arched {{structure}} oriented in a north-south direction and constructed of reinforced concrete and steel. Each span {{consists of three}} steel arches: [...] A center arch which is [...] in width, and two outer arches each [...] in width. To lighten the load on the span arches, the spandrels were filled with additional arches. Depending {{on the size of}} the span, there are either three or four spandrel arches. Together, the <b>span</b> <b>arch</b> and spandrel arches form a truss. The piers were decorated with pilasters in the Doric style.|$|E

50|$|From {{evidence}} {{found in}} excavation sites at Olynthus, Pompeii and Herculaneum, portieres {{appear to have}} been used as room dividers in classic antiquity. Mosaics from the 2nd to 6th century show curtains suspended from rods <b>spanning</b> <b>arches.</b>|$|R
50|$|The current {{bridge is}} a three <b>span,</b> {{reinforced}} concrete <b>arch</b> bridge. It {{was built in}} 1927. The central <b>arch</b> <b>spans</b> 38.1 metres. The two side <b>arches</b> <b>span</b> 30.9 metres. Each of the three arches contains four ribs.|$|R
2500|$|Somewhat {{reminiscent}} of the famous Wembley Stadium arch, a [...] long free and [...] high <b>span</b> <b>arch</b> holds up {{the roof of the}} stadium, the top of the arch rises to [...] above the pitch. The arch also represents the once divided nation coming together, inspired by the South African Flag. The arch consists of a 5×5m steel hollow box and weighs 2,600 tonnes. A funicular carries visitors from {{the north side of the}} stadium to a viewing platform at the top of the arch, offering a view over city and ocean. The south side features a 550-step adventure walk.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fact that}} people used river as a main element of urban life led to {{construction}} of Stari most in 1566 in Mostar in Herzegovina. At {{the time it was}} built it was the longest single <b>span</b> <b>arch</b> stone bridge in the world. [...] Its meaning had however rather more profound power. It symbolized the connection between eastern and western civilization. [...] In addition to urban planning, architecture of Bosnia has emerged with a bit clearer architectural vocabulary. Architecture however was organized around a set of unwritten architectural laws including: human scale, unobstructed views, geometry, open and flexible spaces, simple furniture, spatial links to nature and use of local materials and traditional building techniques. In addition design philosophy favored heterogeneity of materials. [...] In other words, each material had a particular intrinsic function given to it by social perception of the people involved in the architectural process. [...] Juraj Neidhardt described this perception as following:” ...|$|E
50|$|The Denburn Valley was crossed by Union Street by Union Bridge (constructed 1801-05), {{which has}} a single <b>span</b> <b>arch</b> of 130 ft.|$|E
50|$|This is a {{steel truss}} arch bridge with {{suspended}} deck. There are two separate <b>spans,</b> a double <b>arch</b> <b>span</b> on the U.S. {{side and a}} single <b>arch</b> <b>span</b> on the Canadian side. The double <b>arch</b> <b>spans</b> cross the four U.S. Soo Locks. The single <b>arch</b> <b>spans</b> the single Canadian Lock. In Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, the bridge ends at a city street, Huron Street, in the downtown core. The total length of the bridge approaches 2.8 mi. The Bridge allows bicycles to cross, {{but the lack of}} dedicated bike lanes requires cyclists to take proper precautions to ensure visibility.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century a bridge no longer met the increased traffic loads, and therefore in 1816 it was rebuilt. The new bridge was built to the design of architect William Heste as a single <b>span</b> <b>arched</b> bridge. Like other Heste's bridges, it was made from iron cast with granite facing.|$|R

50|$|The local {{landmark}} is the Headstone Viaduct, {{built by}} the Midland Railway, over the River Wye, immediately after the 533 yd Headstone Tunnel, travelling north from Great Longstone. The viaduct, usually incorrectly called Monsal Dale Viaduct, is 300 ft long, with five 50 ft <b>span</b> <b>arches,</b> some 40 ft high at the centre. Initially, some slippage occurred, and remedial work {{was carried out in}} 1907-08.|$|R
2500|$|Two other {{prominent}} viaducts, namely the eleven <b>arch</b> <b>span</b> Gree viaduct {{and the seven}} <b>arch</b> <b>span</b> Giffenmill viaduct were both located between the former Lugton and Giffen stations were demolished in September 2006, and February 2008 respectively.|$|R
5000|$|Spanning the Trent 100 metres {{downstream}} of its confluence {{with the}} River Sow, {{it was built}} in the late sixteenth century by the Earl of Essex a favourite of Queen Elizabeth I. The Earl lived nearby at Chartley Castle. It is now the longest remaining packhorse bridge in England with fourteen of its original forty round <b>span</b> <b>arches</b> left, and has been described as [...] "perhaps the least altered old bridge in the county" ...|$|R
50|$|Currently {{the main}} span {{consists}} of a 68 m long steel arch carrying the 11.8 m wide deck. The reconstruction works also included strengthening the piers supporting the central <b>span</b> <b>arch</b> structure. Cost of the reconstruction works {{was reported to be}} 17.17 million Croatian kuna. The reconstruction works were carried out by Konstruktor, Split.|$|E
50|$|Later, {{a highway}} was built through Kenora in 1932, {{becoming}} part of Canada's first coast-to-coast highway in 1943, and then part of the Trans-Canada Highway, placing the community on both of Canada's major transcontinental transportation routes. The original barrier to {{the completion of the}} highway concerned the crossing of the Winnipeg River at two locations. The single <b>span</b> <b>arch</b> bridges are among the longest of their type in North America.|$|E
50|$|The viaduct {{was built}} between May 1873 and November 1875 and forms {{part of the}} Great Northern Railway Derbyshire Extension which was built in part to exploit the coalfields in Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire. The {{contract}} was given by the Great Northern Railway (GNR) to Joseph Firbank with the line laid out by, and the viaduct designed by Richard Johnson (Chief Civil Engineer of the GNR); Samuel Abbott was the resident engineer.At Awsworth Junction the railway branched, one line passed over the Bennerley Viaduct, the other turned North towards Pinxton crossing the Giltbrook Viaduct (or Kimberley Viaduct but known locally as Forty Bridges). This viaduct was built of red bricks used to create 43 arched spans with a total length of 1716 ft and a height of 60 ft. The viaduct was S-shaped and built in four sections. The first section consisted of a single 27 ft long skew <b>span</b> <b>arch</b> crossing Awsworth Lane followed by 13 arches each spanning 30 ft. The second section consisted of one 27 ft skew <b>span</b> <b>arch</b> over the Midland Railway's Bulwell to Bennerley branch line followed by 15 arches each spanning 30 ft. The third section started with a 27 ft long skew <b>span</b> <b>arch,</b> skewed in the opposite direction, crossing the Midland Railway's line to Digby Colliery which was immediately to the East of the viaduct followed by 3 arched spans of 30 ft. The fourth section started with a 45 ft long segmental arch which crossed the Greasley arm of the Nottingham Canal followed by 8 arched spans 30 ft long. Each section was separated by stop piers. To the South West of the viaduct next to the Nottingham Canal arm was a Nottingham Gas Light and Coke Company chemical works of which Thomas Hawksley was once the managing engineer.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The Military Engineering eXperimental Establishment (MEXE) {{method is}} a long {{established}} system of masonry arch load carrying capacity assessment. It has been subject to review {{in recent years and}} some shortcomings have been identified. There is now growing consensus that the current version of MEXE overestimates the load carrying capacity of short span bridges, but for spans over 12 m it becomes increasingly conservative. In this paper Pippard’s elastic method and the MEXE method are used to investigate the significance of factors such as fill cover, ring thickness and effective width of arch barrel, and their effect upon the load-carrying capacity predictions in short and long <b>span</b> <b>arches.</b> Conclusions are drawn which establish directions of new research and offer guidance to assessors of short and long <b>span</b> masonry <b>arch</b> bridges...|$|R

5000|$|The initial {{construction}} {{process of the}} bridge was stalled due to the World War I, although the bridge was partially renewed in 1917 and 1927. In 1921 a committee of engineers named the 'Mukherjee Committee' was formed, headed by Sir R.N. Mukherjee, Sir Clement Hindley, Chairman of Calcutta Port Trust and J. McGlashan, Chief Engineer. They referred the matter to Sir Basil Mott, who proposed a single <b>span</b> <b>arch</b> bridge. Charles Alfred O"Grady one of the Engineers ...|$|E
5000|$|The Crawford Bridge was {{a triple}} <b>span</b> <b>Arch</b> bridge built in 1914 to 1915 to replace an early wooden bridge (1884) that spanned Garrison Creek {{in the area}} known today's as Trinity-Bellwoods. The bridge's design was {{influenced}} by Public Works Commissioner R.C. Harris with a more pleasing structure for the public. The bridge was built to allow residents in the new residential development along Crawford Street to cross over the valley over from north of Lobb Avenue {{to the south of}} Dundas Street West.|$|E
5000|$|The Bow Bridge is a {{cast iron}} bridge located in Central Park, New York City, {{crossing}} over The Lake {{and used as}} a pedestrian walkway. It is decorated with an interlocking circles banister, with eight planting urns on top of decorative bas-relief [...] Intricate arabesque elements and volutes can be seen underneath the <b>span</b> <b>arch.</b> The bridge was designed by Calvert Vaux and Jacob Wrey Mould, and completed in 1862.
