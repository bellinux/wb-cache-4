50|$|Percolators {{began to}} be {{developed}} from the mid-nineteenth century. In the United States, James Nason of Massachusetts patented an early percolator design in 1865. An Illinois farmer named Hanson Goodrich is generally credited with patenting the modern percolator. Goodrich's patent was granted on August 16, 1889, and his patent description varies little from the stovetop percolators sold today. With the percolator design, water is heated in a boiling pot with a removable lid, until the heated water is forced through a metal tube into a brew basket containing coffee. The extracted liquid drains from the brew basket, where it drips back into the pot. This process is continually repeated during the brewing cycle until the liquid passing repeatedly through the grounds is sufficiently steeped. A clear <b>sight</b> <b>chamber</b> {{in the form of}} a transparent knob on the lid of the percolator enables the user to judge when the coffee has reached the proper color and strength.|$|E

5000|$|In the 1950s, Colt resumed {{manufacture}} of the Single Action Army {{and made a}} Buntline version, due to customer demand. The barrels are marked {{on the left side}} [...] "COLT BUNTLINE SPECIAL [...]45". A few third-generation Buntlines were manufactured in the late 1970s, as well. Colt manufactured 70 New Frontier Buntline Specials from 1962 to 1967 with 12-inch barrels and folding target <b>sights,</b> <b>chambered</b> in [...]45 Colt.|$|R
5000|$|The Model 64 is a six-shot {{double-action}} revolver with fixed <b>sights</b> <b>chambered</b> in [...]38 Special. It was {{the second}} all stainless steel revolver made by Smith & Wesson, the first being the Smith & Wesson Model 60. It was widely used by several U.S. police, sheriff and state agencies and was a popular choice in high humid states because the stainless model 64 was more corrosion and rust resistant than the blued Model 10.|$|R
5000|$|A {{sniper rifle}} is a man-portable, high precision, shoulder-fired rifle, for {{military}} or law enforcement use, {{designed to ensure}} more accurate shooting at longer ranges than other small arms. A typical sniper rifle is built for high levels of accuracy, fitted with a telescopic <b>sight</b> and <b>chambered</b> for a military centerfire cartridge.|$|R

5000|$|The Smith & Wesson Model 18 (or the 22 Combat Masterpiece) {{was built}} on S&W's [...] "K" [...] Frame, (Smith & Wesson's {{designation}} for 'medium frame' firearms.) It was a tapered, 4-inch-barreled, double-action revolver, with adjustable open <b>sights,</b> <b>chambered</b> for the [...]22 long rifle Many believe the Model 18 {{was designed as a}} training weapon for law enforcement officials and others who primarily carried Model 10's, 15's and 19's-.38 Special and [...]357 caliber revolvers. The Model 18 (like the Model 17) operates and handles in a similar fashion to these law enforcement models of the day; and closely shares the size, weight, grips, internal mechanism, and operation of several popular [...] "K" [...] framed revolvers like the Model 10 (.38 Cal.), Model 13 (.38 & [...]357 Cal.), Model 14 (.38 Cal.), Model 15 (.38 Cal.) and Model 19 (.38 & [...]357 Cal.) The only significant difference was the Model 18's [...]22 caliber.|$|R
5000|$|The M59 was {{redesigned}} in 1967, {{hence the}} M67, and was made using a captured World War II German M98 action, {{fitted with a}} heavy target stock and barrel. It was usually fitted with Busk diopter <b>sights.</b> It was <b>chambered</b> in 6.5×55mm, 7.62 NATO and in [...]22 LR as a single shot.|$|R
50|$|The M24 {{series is}} a line of Mauser pattern bolt-action battle rifles {{produced}} {{for use by the}} Yugoslavian military. They are similar to the Czech vz. 24 rifle, featuring open <b>sights,</b> 8×57mm IS <b>chambering,</b> carbine-length barrels, hardwood stocks, and straight bolt handles. All M24 series weapons are designed to accept the M-24/48 pattern bayonet.|$|R
50|$|The Condor Outback {{model has}} 20-inch barrels. It has rifle style sights, with a fixed blade front sight and a notched rear <b>sight.</b> It is <b>chambered</b> in 12-gauge or 20-gauge. It has been {{manufactured}} with two different finishes - walnut stock and fore-end with blued metal, and black hardwood stock and fore-end with nickel-plated metal.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} models of Condor, with {{different}} features and in various gauges. The standard model has a grade-A walnut stock and fore-end, blued receiver and barrels, a single trigger, and screw-in choke tubes. It has a vented barrel rib and a brass bead front <b>sight.</b> It is <b>chambered</b> to use either 2-¾ inch or 3 inch shells. Opening the action automatically engages the safety mechanism.|$|R
60|$|Again, as he {{bore the}} body from the room, he shot a quick but searching glance toward me, and then his eyes fell once more upon the bald and shiny dome of the dead man in his arms. The last {{fleeting}} glimpse that I obtained of his profile as he passed from my <b>sight</b> without the <b>chamber</b> revealed a cunning smile of triumph upon his lips.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are not to}} be blamed. So long {{as there}} was danger you kept up, and, in truth, it was danger that might well drive the blood {{from the face of the}} bravest woman; for the <b>sight</b> of that <b>chamber,</b> after the fight was over, must, in itself, have filled a maid of your age with horror. Why, the princess herself swooned on vastly less occasion. No, no, girl, I am well pleased with you; as for your mother, she had seen such sights before, but it was a rough {{beginning}} for you, and I think that you acted bravely and well." ...|$|R
60|$|While these {{thoughts}} passed through Everard's mind, feelings unknown to him, {{even when he}} stood first on the rough and perilous edge of battle, gained ground upon him. He feared he knew not what; and where an open and discernible peril would have drawn out his courage, the absolute uncertainty of his situation increased his sense of the danger. He felt an almost irresistible desire to spring from his bed and heap fuel on the dying embers, expecting by the blaze to see some strange <b>sight</b> in his <b>chamber.</b> He was also strongly tempted to awaken Wildrake; but shame, stronger than fear itself, checked these impulses. What! should it be thought that Markham Everard, held {{one of the best}} soldiers who had drawn a sword in this sad war--Markham Everard, who had obtained such distinguished rank in the army of the Parliament, though so young in years, was afraid of remaining by himself in a twilight-room at midnight? It never should be said.|$|R

We will make our home in Stirling or Linlithgow, we two, and leave Holyrood to him. I have seen too much there ever to thole the <b>sight</b> of those <b>chambers,</b> far less of the High Street of Edinburgh; but Stirling, bonnie Stirling, ay, I would fain ride a hawking there once more. Methinks a Highland breeze would put life and youth into me again. There's a little chamber opening into mine, where I will bestow thee, my Lady Bride of Scotland, for so long as I may keep thee. Ah! it will not be for long.

50|$|The Millennium Pro pistols offer many {{improvements}} {{over the}} standard models, but were introduced as enhancements to the originals, not to supplement them. Pro counterparts {{have now been}} released for {{nearly all of the}} original models. Some features of the Pro line include optional increased magazine capacities, larger and easier to operate controls, a single-action/double-action trigger mechanism on some models with reduced trigger travel and an improved smoother and lighter trigger pull, an enhanced frame, and an improved more ergonometric grip design. Key to the grip upgrade are recesses which Taurus call 'Memory pads', intended to promote a consistent shooting grip from shot to shot. Other Pro improvements include the contrast enhanced Heinie ‘Straight-8’ sighting system, as well as optional night <b>sights,</b> a loaded <b>chamber</b> indicator which can be felt as well as seen, and a feature labeled 'posi-traction' which consists of an alteration to the number and layout of the slide serrations resulting in an improved gripping surface.|$|R
50|$|While the Steyr M is {{frequently}} compared to Glock-series pistols (both are polymer-framed striker-fired pistols, with Tenifer finishes), {{there are several}} differences {{in the details of}} the design. For example, the M-series had a fully supported chamber in all chamberings from the start (Some Glock models also had this feature from the start, other Glock models evolved to having more supported chambers when compared to their original internal layout), unique triangular/trapezoid <b>sights,</b> a loaded <b>chamber</b> indicator {{in the form of an}} extractor protrusion, witness hole on the top rear of the barrel and a rod below the rear sights that sits flush in the rear of the slide when the chamber is empty and is raised slightly when the chamber is loaded for a visual and tactile indicator of the firearm’s condition (on third and later generation Glock pistols this feature is present on the extractor on the right slide side) and a different grip angle (111°).|$|R
60|$|We rode by shining {{clumps of}} the Portugal laurel, a {{beautiful}} evergreen, much resembling our mountain rhododendron; {{then there was}} the prickly, polished, dark-green holly, which I had never seen before, but which is, certainly, one of the most perfect of shrubs. The turf was of that soft, dazzling green, and had that peculiar velvet-like smoothness, which seem characteristic of England. We stopped at last before the door of a cottage, whose porch was overgrown with ivy. From that moment I ceased to feel myself a stranger in England. I cannot tell you how delightful to me, dizzy and weary as I was, was the first <b>sight</b> of the <b>chamber</b> of reception which had been prepared for us. No item of cozy comfort that one could desire was omitted. The sofa and easy chair wheeled up before a cheerful coal fire, a bright little teakettle steaming in front of the grate, a table with a beautiful vase of flowers, books, and writing apparatus, and kind friends with words full of affectionate cheer,--all these made me feel at home in a moment.|$|R
40|$|An {{enhanced}} alignment cube {{has been}} invented {{for use in}} a confined setting (e. g., a cryogenic chamber) in which optical access may be limited to a single line of sight. Whereas traditional alignment-cube practice entails the use of two theodolites aimed along two lines of sight, the enhanced alignment cube yields complete alignment information through use of a single theodolite aimed along a single line of sight. Typically, an alignment cube is placed in contact with a datum surface or other reference feature on a scientific instrument during assembly or testing of the instrument. The alignment cube is then used in measuring a small angular deviation of the feature from a precise required orientation. Commonly, the deviation is expressed in terms of rotations (Rx,Ry,Rz) of the cube about the corresponding Cartesian axes (x,y,z). In traditional practice, in order to measure all three rotations, it is necessary to use two theodolites aimed at two orthogonal faces of the alignment cube, as shown in {{the upper part of the}} figure. To be able to perform such a measurement, one needs optical access to these two faces. In the case of an alignment cube inside a cryogenic chamber or other enclosed space, the optical-access requirement translates to a requirement for two windows located along the corresponding two orthogonal lines of <b>sight</b> into the <b>chamber.</b> In a typical application, it is difficult or impossible to provide two windows. The present enhanced version of the alignment cube makes it possible to measure all three rotations by use of a single line of sight, thereby obviating a second window...|$|R
60|$|Pat's {{first choice}} was Sparrer, to the youngster's secret delight. He then chose McNulty and Bernstein, {{and the two}} companies, Pat {{at the head of}} one and Upton {{at the head of the}} other, started at the Scout pace for the scene of action. Arrived there a camp was marked off and Pat and his company at once started off to make the most of the ten minutes allotted them. Meanwhile Upton laid out his plan of campaign. The camp had been chosen with a view to defense. On two sides were dense {{thickets}} of bushes from which it would be practically impossible to throw a snowball. Moreover, to reach these thickets it would be necessary for the enemy to cross a bare hilltop, which meant that surprise from that quarter was virtually out of the question. On the third side was an outcropping ledge of rock behind which the defenders could take shelter. The fourth side was open, but could not be approached without the enemy being in sight for some time. Moreover, in the flat open country beyond there was no snow, hence the enemy attacking from that direction would not be able to replenish their ammunition. Upton decided that two men were ample for defense, and at once set all hands to work making a supply of snowballs from the patches of snow still lingering in the thickets. Promptly at the end of ten minutes Chick Parsons was sent out as scout to try to pick up the enemy's trail at the point where they had disappeared from view with instructions to signal what he should discover. Norwood was sent in the opposite direction to look for signs on the chance that the enemy had circled as soon as they were out of <b>sight.</b> Patterson and <b>Chambers</b> were left to guard camp and Upton climbed to the top of the little hill which flanked the camp and from which point he could get signals from both Scouts. The game was on.|$|R
