These <b>sugar</b> <b>phosphates</b> were formed in aerobically growing cells, as well as in cells under stringent control of ribonucleic acid synthesis. The main 32 P-labeled product was identified as sedoheptulose 7 -phosphate in two strains (B 1 and K- 12 MK- 1) and fructose 1, 6 -diphosphate in one strain (K- 12 CP 78). The formation of <b>sugar</b> <b>phosphates</b> induced by colicin K was inhibited by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone. It was also not observed in N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-treated cells or Mg 2 +-(Ca 2 +) -adenosine triphosphatase-less mutant (strain K- 12 AN 120) cells. Thus, the formation of <b>sugar</b> <b>phosphates</b> in colicin K-treated cells is dependent on the formation of adenosine 5 '-triphosphate by oxidative phosphorylation...|$|R

This experiment begun by observing that dialyzed (purified) yeast juice could not ferment or even create a <b>sugar</b> <b>phosphate.</b> This mixture was rescued {{with the addition of}} undialyzed yeast extract that had been boiled. Boiling the yeast extract renders all proteins inactive (as it denatures them). The ability of boiled extract plus dialyzed juice to complete fermentation suggests that the cofactors were non-protein in character.|$|E

Likewise, it is shown that pathways including lactate, aspartate, serine, glycine, malate, and succinate are not of importance in the synthesis of acetate from CO 2.

At the end of 2 weeks, the low-P plants were resupplied with 1. 0 mM Pi. Low-P plants rapidly accumulated large amounts of Pi, and the photosynthesis rate increased to control values within 4 to 6 h. The rate of photosynthesis appeared {{to be controlled by}} ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate (RuBP); low P reduced photosynthesis and RuBP levels, and P resupply increased photosynthesis and RuBP in a manner parallel with time. Low-P treatment reduced adenylate levels substantially but not nicotinamide nucleotides; adenylate levels recovered to control values over 3 to 6 h. With low P, more photosynthate is allocated to non-P carbon compounds (e. g. starch, sucrose) than to <b>sugar</b> <b>phosphates.</b> When P is resupplied, <b>sugar</b> <b>phosphates</b> increase as starch and sucrose pools decrease; this increase in leaf (chloroplast) <b>sugar</b> <b>phosphates</b> was most likely responsible for the increases in RuBP and photosynthesis and may have increased adenylate levels (through enhanced levels of ribose- 5 -phosphate) ...|$|R

Gluconeogenesis is a biosynthetic pathway wherein glucose is created from noncarbohydrate precursors; the pathway is essential because many tissues can only derive energy from glucose.

30|$|To this end, we have {{exploited}} {{an alternative}} sugar transporter, the bacterial universal hexose phosphate transporter (UHPT) [30]. The UHPT is expressed by many different Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial species including S. aureus and is induced by extracellular glucose- 6 -phosphate. It {{is the sole}} mechanism by which <b>sugar</b> <b>phosphates</b> are internalised into the staphylococcal cell. Consequently, this defined route for staphylococcal transport of glucose- 6 -phosphate makes UHPT an ideal candidate for the delivery of targeted bacteria-specific probes. [18 F]FDG and [18 F]FDG- 6 -P are analogues of glucose, and {{it is reasonable to}} assume that [18 F]FDG- 6 -P would be selectively transported into bacterial cells, which, in contrast to mammalian cells, can internalise <b>sugar</b> <b>phosphates</b> from their surrounding environment.

40|$|The {{biological}} and chemical basis of vanadium action in fungi is relatively poorly understood. In the present study, we investigate the influence of vanadate (V 5 +) on phosphate metabolism of Phycomyces blakesleeanus. Addition of V 5 + caused increase of <b>sugar</b> <b>phosphates</b> signal intensities in 31 P NMR spectra in vivo. HPLC analysis of mycelial phosphate extracts demonstrated increased concentrations of glucose 6 phosphate, fructose 6 phosphate, fructose 1, 6 phosphate and glucose 1 phosphate after V 5 + treatment. Influence of V 5 + on the levels of fructose 2, 6 phosphate, glucosamine 6 phosphate and glucose 1, 6 phosphate (HPLC), and polyphosphates, UDPG and ATP (31 P NMR) was also established. Increase of <b>sugar</b> <b>phosphates</b> content was not observed after addition of vanadyl (V 4 +), indicating that only vanadate influences its metabolism.

40|$|Metabolomics is a {{powerful}} tool for the study of biological systems. Besides analytical techniques, cell harvest and extraction are critical steps, especially when studying encapsulated streptococci. We have compared four different harvesting techniques for biomass from liquid culture of the hyaluronic acid (HA) -producing bacterium Streptococcus zooepidemicus. The best method for cell separation was quick (2 min) centrifugation, which allowed efficient medium removal and enabled quantification of the broadest range of sugar metabolites. Unlike observations for other microbes, changes in metabolite pools due to a delay of extraction by the centrifugation were not observed, so metabolite levels accurately reflected the metabolome at the point of cell harvest. A hypothesis is that the capsule itself isolates the cells from the surroundings and still supports it with nutrients during the harvest. Quantification of <b>sugar</b> <b>phosphates</b> and nucleotide <b>sugars</b> was performed using high-performance anion exchange chromatography combined with pulsed amperometric detection, achieving limits of quantification of 2. 5 pmol for <b>sugar</b> <b>phosphates</b> and 5 pmol on column for nucleotide sugars.
