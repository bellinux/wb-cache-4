500|$|The {{next stage}} is called oligarchic accretion. It is {{characterized}} by the dominance of several hundred of the largest bodies—oligarchs, which continue to slowly accrete planetesimals. No body other than the oligarchs can grow. At this stage the rate of accretion is proportional to R2, which is derived from the geometrical cross-section of an oligarch. The specific accretion rate is proportional to and it declines with the mass of the body. This allows smaller oligarchs to catch up to larger ones. The oligarchs are kept at the distance of about [...] (= is the Hill radius, where a is the semimajor axis, e is the orbital eccentricity, and Ms is the mass of the central star) from each other by the influence of the remaining planetesimals. Their orbital eccentricities and inclinations remain small. The oligarchs continue to accrete until planetesimals are exhausted in the disk around them. Sometimes nearby oligarchs merge. The final mass of an oligarch depends on the distance from the star and <b>surface</b> <b>density</b> of planetesimals and is called the isolation mass. For the rocky planets it is up to , or one Mars mass. The final result of the oligarchic stage is the formation of about 100 Moon- to Mars-sized planetary embryos uniformly spaced at about [...] They are thought to reside inside gaps in the disk and to be separated by rings of remaining planetesimals. This stage is thought to last a few hundred thousand years.|$|E

The injection of an excess of ANP, together with [125 I]ANP, significantly inhibited the uptake of radioactive ANP in the lung tissue. Following autoradiography, silver grains of [125 I]ANP labelled Type II cells, endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells of vessels, bronchi and bronchioles. As for morphometric changes in subcellular structures of Type II cells after the injection of ANP, the volume and <b>surface</b> <b>densities</b> of the rough endoplasmic reticulum increased at 15 minutes, while those of the Golgi complex increased from 5 minutes, peaking at 30 minutes.

2500|$|At {{the same}} time that Rubin and Ford were {{exploring}} optical rotation curves, radio astronomers were making use of new radio telescopes to map the 21cm line of atomic hydrogen in nearby galaxies. The radial distribution of interstellar atomic hydrogen often extends to much larger galactic radii than those accessible by optical studies, allowing the sampling of rotation curves – and thus of the total mass distribution – to a new dynamical regime. Early mapping of Andromeda with the 300-foot telescope at Green Bank [...] and the 250-foot dish at Jodrell Bank [...] already showed that the HI rotation curve did not trace the expected Keplerian decline. As more sensitive receivers became available, Morton Roberts and Robert Whitehurst [...] were able to trace the rotational velocity of Andromeda to 30 kpc, much beyond the optical measurements. Illustrating the advantage of tracing the gas disk at large radii, Figure 16 of that paper [...] combines the optical data [...] (the cluster of points at radii of less than 15 kpc with a single point further out) with the HI data between 20 and 30 kpc, exhibiting the flatness of the outer galaxy rotation curve; the solid curve peaking at the center is the optical <b>surface</b> <b>density,</b> while the other curve shows the cumulative mass, still rising linearly at the outermost measurement. In parallel, the use of interferometric arrays for extragalactic HI spectroscopy was being developed. In 1972, David Rogstad and Seth Shostak [...] published HI rotation curves of five spirals mapped with the Owens Valley interferometer; the rotation curves of all five were very flat, suggesting very large values of mass-to-light ratio in the outer parts of their extended HI disks.|$|E

VOx domains on Al 2 O 3 modified by an equivalent MoOx monolayer led to dispersed binary structures at all <b>surface</b> <b>densities.</b> MoOx layers led to higher reactivity for VOx domains present at low VOx <b>surface</b> <b>densities</b> by replacing V-O-Al structures with more reactive V-O-Mo species. At higher <b>surface</b> <b>densities,</b> V-O-V structures in prevalent polyvanadates were replaced with less reactive V-O-Mo, leading to lower reducibility and oxidative dehydrogenation rates. Raman, reduction, and UV-visible data indicate that polyvanadates predominant on Al 2 O 3 convert to dispersed binary oxide structures when MoOx is deposited before or after VOx deposition; these structures are less reducible and show higher UV-visible absorption energies than polyvanadate structures on Al 2 O 3. The deposition sequence in binary Mo-V catalysts {{did not lead to}} significant differences in structure or catalytic rates, suggesting that the two active oxide components become intimately mixed.

40|$|Using star {{formation}} histories derived from optically resolved stellar populations in nineteen nearby starburst dwarf galaxies observed with the Hubble Space Telescope, we measure the stellar mass <b>surface</b> <b>densities</b> of stars newly {{formed in the}} bursts. By assuming a {{star formation}} efficiency (SFE), we then calculate the inferred gas <b>surface</b> <b>densities</b> present {{at the onset of}} the starbursts. Assuming a SFE of 1 %, as is often assumed in normal star-forming galaxies, and assuming that the gas was purely atomic, translates to very high HI <b>surface</b> <b>densities</b> (~ 10 ^ 2 - 10 ^ 3 Msun pc^- 2), which are much higher than have been observed in dwarf galaxies. This implies either higher values of SFE in these dwarf starburst galaxies or the presence of significant amounts of H_ 2 in dwarfs (or both). Raising the assumed SFEs to 10 % or greater (in line with observations of more massive starbursts associated with merging galaxies), still results in HI <b>surface</b> <b>densities</b> higher than observed in 10 galaxies. Thus, these observations appear to require that a significant fraction of the gas in these dwarf starbursts galaxies was in the molecular form {{at the onset of the}} bursts. Our results imply molecular gas column densities in the range 10 ^ 19 - 10 ^ 21 cm^- 2 for the sample.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{relationship}} between maximum cluster mass, and <b>surface</b> <b>densities</b> of total gas (Sigma_gas), molecular gas (Sigma_H_ 2), neutral gas (Sigma_HI) and star formation rate (Sigma_SFR) in the grand design galaxy M 51, using published gas data and a catalog of masses, ages, and reddenings of more than 1800 star clusters in its disk, of which 223 are above the cluster mass distribution function completeness limit. We find for clusters older than 25 Myr that M_ 3 rd, the median of the 5 most massive clusters, is proportional to Sigma_HI^ 0. 4. There is no correlation with Sigma_gas, Sigma_H 2, or Sigma_SFR. For clusters younger than 10 Myr, M_ 3 rd is proportional to Sigma_HI^ 0. 6, M_ 3 rd is proportional to Sigma_gas^ 0. 5; there is no correlation with either Sigma_H_ 2 or Sigma_SFR. The results could hardly be more different than those found for clusters younger than 25 Myr in M 33. For the flocculent galaxy M 33, there is no correlation between maximum cluster mass and neutral gas, but M_ 3 rd is proportional to Sigma_gas^ 3. 8; M_ 3 rd is proportional to Sigma_H_ 2 ^ 1. 2; M_ 3 rd proportional to Sigma_SFR^ 0. 9. For the older sample in M 51, the lack of tight correlations is {{probably due to the}} combination of the strong azimuthal variations in the <b>surface</b> <b>densities</b> of gas and star formation rate, and the cluster ages. These two facts mean that neither the azimuthal average of the <b>surface</b> <b>densities</b> at a given radius, nor the <b>surface</b> <b>densities</b> at the present-day location of a stellar cluster represent the true <b>surface</b> <b>densities</b> at the place and time of cluster formation. In the case of the younger sample, even if the clusters have not yet traveled too far from their birthsites, the poor resolution of the radio data compared to the physical sizes of the clusters results in measured Sigmas that are likely quite diluted compared to the actual densities relevant for the formation of the clusters.
