40|$|The three {{categories}} of agents involved in {{the largest number of}} agricultural fatalities in Iowa are tractors, other farm machinery, and motor vehicles. All are involved during harvest as grain is transported on public roadways. Forty-eight percent of all motor vehicle collisions involving farm equipment in Iowa occur from October through December. Tractors and wagons delivering grain to six elevators during fall harvest were evaluated. Vocational agriculture student teams inspected for compliance with Iowa code and ASAE standards for lighting, marking, hitch, and ROPS safety equipment. A majority of tractors complied with safety standards for: headlights, front amber flashing lights, slow moving vehicle (SMV) emblem, and roll over protection structure (ROPS). Tractors less than eight years old met Iowa code and ASAE safety standards for rear amber flashing lights and rear taillight. Tractors less than 15 years old {{were more likely to be}} equipped with ROPS (98 %) than were tractors more than 15 years old (67 %). Compliance with <b>safety</b> <b>items</b> other than ROPS did not significantly differ among tractor age groups.

40|$|The primary {{function}} of delineation {{is to provide}} the visual information needed by a driver to operate a vehicle {{in a variety of}} situations. Delineation includes the marking of highways with painted or more durable pavement marking lines and symbols, guideposts, and other devices such as curbs (see Chapter 1140). These devices use retroreflectance, which is the reflecting of light from a vehicle’s headlights back to the driver, to enhance an object’s visibility at nighttime. It is important to maintain an adequate level of retroreflectivity for both traffic signs and traffic markings for motorists during hours of darkness and during adverse weather conditions. Delineation is a required <b>safety</b> <b>item</b> of work and is addressed on all projects. A decision to omit delineation work can only be justified if the existing delineation is unaffected by construction and an evaluation of accident rates clearly shows that delineation is not a contributing factor. The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) uses the latest edition of the MUTCD as a guide for the design, location, and application of delineation. Consult with the region Traffic Office early in the design process to ensure the proposed delineation is compatible with WSDOT policy and region preference. These policies and preferences address both the type of markings and the material selection...|$|E
40|$|Accident {{rate and}} {{severity}} reduction at roadwork sites requires an integrated and systematic approach aimed at identifying and solving the safety problems. An effective approach, which is quickly spreading at international level, is the workzone safety audit. Road safety audit is a formal examination {{of a future}} road or traffic project, an existing road, or any project which interacts with road users, where an independent, qualified team reports on the project’s potential accident and safety performance, by trying to investigate how the road environment is perceived, and ultimately utilised by different road users. The paper presents a road safety audit procedure specifically suited for workzones. It is based on detailed checklists and on risk assessment. New risk indicators, that involve the prediction of the number and severity of potential accidents associated with each <b>safety</b> <b>item,</b> have been defined: the Total Weighted Score of the main safety aspects, which relates to the risk factors {{that may be improved}} by engineering measures, and the Global Safety Index, which allows the evaluation of the global safety of the workzone and the ranking of workzones in the road network. The proposed safety evaluation procedure is strongly related to the safety consequences of the identified problems, rather than on the standard non-compliance or on the number of deficiencies. Pilot safety audits, which have been carried out both in urban and rural areas, have identified many safety issues, whose removal or mitigation requires low cost safety measures...|$|E

40|$|Background: Patient {{feedback}} {{surveys are}} increasingly {{seen as a}} key component of 2 healthcare quality monitoring and improvement. Objective: To describe the 3 development and initial psychometric evaluation of a fixed-length questionnaire of 4 Patients’ Experiences undergoing physical therapy treatment in a Post-Acute 5 Outpatients settings (PEPAP-Q). Design: An instrument development study with 6 validity and reliability testing. Methods: A total of 465 patients from three 7 rehabilitation centres for musculoskeletal conditions completed the questionnaire. A 8 cognitive pretest was applied to the draft version (n= 94), and a revised version was 9 tested for test-retest reliability (n= 90). Analyses to evaluate variance and non-response 10 rates to items, the factor structure of the questionnaire and the metric properties of 11 multi-item scales were conducted. Results: Exploratory factor analyses yielded 12 evidence for a seven-factor structure to the PEPAP-Q, with three factors that may be 13 conceptually viewed as professionals’ attitudes and behaviour (providing information 14 and education, sensitive manners to patients’ changes and emotional support) and four 15 factors conceptually reflecting organizational environment (attendance duration, 16 interruptions during care delivery, waiting times and patient <b>safety).</b> <b>Item</b> scale 17 correlations ranged from 0. 70 to 0. 93. The percentage of scaling success was 100 % for 18 all the scales. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient ranged from 0. 70 to 0. 87. Intraclass 19 correlation coefficients ranged from 0. 57 to 0. 80 (median= 0. 68). Limitations: 20 Generalization to other patients is not known. Conclusion: The PEPAP-Q is a reliable 21 test-retest and the scales have internal consistency and convergent and discriminant 22 validity. All the scales are distinct and unidimensional.

40|$|Safety climate {{researchers}} {{include both}} general and contextualized {{items in the}}ir safety climate measures. However, the relative value of including contextualized items in the prediction of safety outcomes is an empirical question {{that has not been}} rigorously tested. Theories about language comprehension and ambiguity indicate that context facilitates meaning. Additionally, memory theories and corresponding empirical research indicates that context facilitates recall. By excluding contextual information, general safety climate measures might provide a comparatively deficient assessment of the underlying construct as indicated by weaker relationships with various safety-related constructs (e. g., safety knowledge, injuries, etc.). In the current study, 757 university laboratory personnel completed a contextualized safety climate measure (i. e., chemical, biological, animal, or human subjects/office research laboratory), a general safety climate measure, and measures of a number of other safety-related constructs. In addition, because some safety climate dimensions appear more conducive to specificity (e. g., safety equipment & housekeeping, co-worker safety practices, and safety training) than others (e. g., management commitment to <b>safety),</b> <b>item</b> level analyses were also conducted. Hypotheses were tested by contrasting the contextualized vs. the general safety climate correlations with various safety outcomes. Only the contextualized human subjects/office laboratory measure was consistently more strongly related to the predictors than the general safety climate measure. The results suggest that contextualized information might facilitate comprehension and recall for individuals who work in less (rather than more) safety-salient contexts. Item-level analyses indicate that contextualization for the rewards safety climate dimension is particularly helpful. The results of this study provide a rigorous test of contextualized measure effectiveness; however, further research is warranted to explicitly test the underlying theory and boundary conditions under which contextual information is beneficial...|$|E
