40|$|Government {{contracts}} for services typically include terms requiring contractors {{to comply with}} minimum labour <b>standards</b> laws. Procurement <b>contract</b> <b>clauses</b> specify reporting procedures and sanctions for non-compliance, implying that government contracting agencies will monitor and enforce minimum labour <b>standards</b> within <b>contract</b> performance management. In this article, the case of school cleaners employed under New South Wales government contracts between 2010 and 2011 is the vehicle for exploring {{the effectiveness of these}} protective clauses. We find that the inclusion of these protective <b>clauses</b> in procurement <b>contracts</b> is unnecessary in the Australian context, and any expectations that government contracting agencies will monitor and enforce labour standards are misleading. At best, the clauses are rhetoric, and at worst, they are a distraction for parties with enforcement powers. 17 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – There {{is a lack}} of {{empirical}} research on risk mitigation strategies for those construction projects procured by guaranteed maximum price contracts (GMP) and target cost contracts (TCC). The paper aims to identify and analyse the risk mitigation strategies for GMP/TCC construction projects from the Hong Kong perspective. Design/methodology/approach – A total of 94 industrial practitioners with both sound knowledge and abundant hands-on experience of the GMP/TCC methodology participated in an industry-wide empirical questionnaire survey to indicate their levels of agreement on those 18 risk mitigation strategies identified from reported literature and in-depth interviews which were later analysed by factor analysis. Findings – The results of factor analysis revealed that the 18 individual risk mitigation strategies can be consolidated into seven underlying grouped factors: relational contracting and mutual trust; clear contract provisions and well-defined scope of works; involvement of contractor in decision making process; right selection of project team; third party review of project design at tender stage; <b>standard</b> <b>contract</b> <b>clauses</b> for GMP/TCC schemes; and fair treatment of contractor. Research limitations/implications – Although both GMP/TCC contracts have been increasingly popular in the construction market of Hong Kong, not all of these projects have been equally successful and some of them have been exposed to very high risks or uneven allocation of risks. A detailed analysis and an implementation of recommended effective risk mitigation strategies are essential to the success of GMP/TCC schemes. Originality/value – The research findings of this study are expected to help the decision makers to generate useful insights into risk mitigation strategies when administering GMP/TCC contracts at an early stage of project delivery and lay a solid foundation for further research on GMP/TCC in both local and international contexts.

50|$|The <b>Standard</b> Form <b>Contract</b> Act 1982 {{defines a}} set of depriving {{conditions}} that may be canceled by a court of law, including unreasonable exclusion or limitation of liability, unreasonable privileges to unilaterally cancel, suspend or postpone {{the execution of the}} contract and to change any fundamental charges or pricing, transfer of liability for the execution of the contract to a third party, unreasonable obligation to use the services of a third party or to limit, in any way, the choice of contracting third parties, denial of legal remedy, unreasonable limitations on contractual remedies or setting unreasonable conditions for the consummation of the remedy, denying or limiting the right for legal procedures, exclusive rights to decide on the location of the trial or arbitration, obligatory arbitration with unilaterally control over the arbitrators or the location of the arbitration and setting the holder of the burden of proof contrary to common law. The act also establishes a <b>Standard</b> Form <b>Contract</b> Court, chaired by a district judge and consists of a maximum of 12 members, appointed by the justice minister, including an acting chairman (also a district judge), civil servants (no more than a third) and, at least, 2 consumer organization representatives.

25|$|The {{ruling was}} based around seven issues. The panel {{declared}} that Keegan had been misled {{to believe he}} had the final decision on player transfers, and was never explicitly told in writing, his contract, or word of mouth {{that he did not}} or that his role would see him essentially report to others. Given the generally understood role of a Premiership manager, the panel agreed he could reasonably expect {{that this was not a}} factor. The club's signing of González meant that they had violated his employment contract, which amounted to constructive dismissal. While González was the main issue in the panel final decision, the club's alleged mistreatment of Keegan, claiming they were in a position to sack him should he have not agreed to the terms they offered him, as well as his decision to remain at the club till the 4 September instead of resigning on 1 September, allowing the club to reach a compromise, led to the panel ruling in Keegan's favour. Keegan was awarded £2million (plus interest accrued) according to severance <b>clauses</b> in his <b>contract,</b> which the club never paid him after his departure. Claims for more were turned down on the basis that the <b>standard</b> <b>contract</b> severance <b>clauses</b> covered constructive dismissal, however he happily stated afterwards that the purpose of his claim had been to restore his reputation, and was delighted with the outcome, allowing him to move forward.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the application of}} the doctrine of frustration under the English private law of contracts to situations of capture of merchant ships for ransom by pirates operating according to the model which has developed in recent years off the coast of Somalia. The examination is centred on the question whether and how contracts of affreightment (or carriage of goods by sea) (including time and voyage charters as well as bills of lading) which may have been concluded by a captured ship would be terminated in the event of capture pursuant to the doctrine. The thesis analyses the wording of <b>standard</b> carriage <b>contract</b> forms and <b>clauses,</b> as well as the provisions of relevant international conventions and statutes, which could deal with the standing of contracts following a capture. The outcome of the research is that <b>standard</b> <b>contract</b> and <b>clauses</b> often leave the question of the fate of the contract in the event of capture untouched with the result that the doctrine of frustration may apply by default. The contract will only be terminated, however, if an elaborately long detention of the vessel is anticipated, or the prospects of recovery, either against payment of a ransom or through forceful repossession, are very weak. The thesis equally considers {{the application of the}} concept of self-induced frustration by taking several examples of actions or default by one of the parties to the contract of carriage which may have led to or exacerbated the capture scenario. The main findings are that it will usually be difficult to establish self-induced frustration in the event of capture. An analysis is also made of the application of the concepts of actual and constructive total loss under English marine insurance law to a ship that has been captured by pirates according to the same model of operation. The consequences of termination of the contract are not discussed in this thesis. <br/...|$|R

40|$|The <b>standard</b> form of <b>contract</b> plays a {{significant}} role in a construction project as it communicates the procedures to be adopted in executing the project including the determination of the rights and obligations of contracting parties. Hence, an acceptable degree of commonality in interpretation of this document by different contracting parties is a prerequisite for the smooth functioning of a construction project. The aim of this research is to ascertain whether there is a relationship between readability of <b>contract</b> <b>clauses</b> and their interpretation. Readability is concerned with the complexity of words and sentences of text and it is commonly assessed by readability formulas. The survey undertaken for this research measured the ability of construction <b>contract</b> <b>clauses</b> having different readability values to convey a common understanding to all categories of respondents in terms {{of the degree to which}} risk was apportioned between the client and the contractor. The study reveals that there is a relationship between readability and contract interpretation. When the readability of the contract document is high, there found to be a high degree of commonality in interpretation of the document by different readers. <b>Standard</b> form of <b>contract,</b> <b>contract</b> <b>clauses,</b> readability, risk, interpretation,...|$|R
