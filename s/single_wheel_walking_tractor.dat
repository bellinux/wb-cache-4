50|$|The {{first patent}} (D146,947) {{was applied for}} by Herbert C. Roths on August 24, 1945 {{for the design of}} an {{ornamental}} tractor. This patent was awarded on June 17, 1947. At the time of the second patent (D157,432), Herbert C. Roths was an assignor to Roths Industries Inc., Alma, Michigan. The patent was applied for on December 19, 1946 and awarded on February 21, 1950. The second patent was a garden tractor design which would later become the Roths Garden King <b>walking</b> <b>tractor.</b> The first production Garden King <b>walking</b> <b>tractors</b> were sold in late 1945. Over the next few years variations built from the Garden King's parts would become available. The Roths Model-G and BesRo would borrow many production parts from the Garden King, one of which being the transmission. The company was still producing the Terrier Tractor, Country Boy and Little Jeff riding tractors as late as 1960.|$|R
40|$|A <b>wheeled</b> <b>walking</b> aid with an {{embedded}} controlled {{braking system}} is described. The {{frame of the}} prototype is based on combining features of standard available <b>wheeled</b> <b>walking</b> aids. A braking scheme has been designed using hydraulic disc brakes to facilitate accurate and sensitive controlled stopping of the walker by the user, and if called upon, by automatic action. Braking force is modulated via a linear actuating stepping motor. A microcontroller is used for control of both stepper movement and for supervisory control. An encoder is used to supervise walker movement in terms of time, distance and speed...|$|R

50|$|In 1955, Wijewardene {{designed}} a two-wheeled, <b>walking</b> <b>tractor</b> to help small {{farmers in the}} tropics to mechanise their work. An early attempt to mechanize farm labour during the Green Revolution, it was manufactured and marketed worldwide by the Landmaster company in Nottingham, UK. Having promoted the tractor with farmers in Africa, Asia and Latin America for a decade, Wijewardene later questioned its value addition to poor farmers cultivating small holdings in the developing world.|$|R

A cheaper, less conflated alternative could be to incorporate <b>single</b> <b>wheel</b> testing.

With this prediction algorithm, skid steering can be easily enhanced by iterating on the design of a <b>single</b> <b>wheel</b> without the cost of vehicle testing. To validate this algorithm and explore skid steering enhancement several <b>single</b> <b>wheel</b> skid steering experiments were done and the results were compared to a full vehicle's turning performance...|$|R

These disadvantages can be avoided if each <b>single</b> <b>wheel</b> has its own rating. To guide the <b>single</b> <b>wheels</b> by an adjusting device an appropriate sensor system had to be chosen, it had to be adapted for this special application and it had to be tested on a test vehicle.

40|$|Brazilian {{family farming}} has at its {{disposal}} planters whose furrowing mechanisms, whether disc or shank, require a large vertical force. In smaller planters, this is reflected in low efficiency when opening the furrow or in a high demand for mass (weight). Rotary furrowers require less vertical force for the same operation. This study aimed to evaluate the technical feasibility and performance of rotary furrowers mounted on the powertrain of a <b>walking</b> <b>tractor</b> working under direct seeding, and compare them with shank-type furrowers using bibliographic data. The parameters used in the comparison were the depth and width of the furrow, the area of disturbed soil and the cross-sectional area of the furrow with no soil after the operation. The experiment was carried out on wheat stubble that had lain fallow for six months. Twelve treatments were employed in a factorial design: three models of rotary furrowers, two values for revolutions per unit of linear displacement, and two forward speeds. The variable, cross-sectional area of the furrow with no soil, was statistically affected only by the factor, furrower. However there was significant interaction between the factors, furrower, revolutions per metre and speed, for the variables of depth, furrow width and area of disturbed soil. The values obtained for the variables of width, depth and disturbed area in the cross-section of the furrows, with {{the three types of}} rotary furrowers driven by the powertrain of a <b>walking</b> <b>tractor,</b> were similar to those generated by shank-type furrowers...|$|R
50|$|In Europe, {{super singles}} became popular when the allowed weight of {{semitrailer}} rigs was increased from 38 to 40 tonnes. In this reform the trailer industry replaced two 10 t axles with dual wheels, with three 8 t axles on wide-base <b>single</b> <b>wheels.</b> The significantly lower axle weight on super singles {{must be considered}} when comparing road wear from <b>single</b> versus dual <b>wheels.</b> The majority of super singles sold in Europe have a width of 385 mm. The standard 385 tires have a legal load limit of 4500 kg. (Note that expensive, specially reinforced 385 tires approved for 5000 kg do exist. Their market share is tiny, except for mounting on the steer axle.) A high share of research on road wear from heavy vehicles have failed to consider relevant axle load on super singles, as they compare road wear from 10-tonne axle load both dual <b>wheels</b> and on <b>single</b> <b>wheels,</b> instead of the relevant 8 - 9 t axle load on <b>single</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R

A complete model for power tiller is developed considering kinematics, dynamics and engine dynamics for autonomous operation. Inputs to the simulation model are left clutch control signal and right clutch control signal. Data from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) attached to the power tiller enables validation of the model using analogue matching and integral least squares. The result of the validation is that the model is a suitable representation of the power tiller. Developed model is intended to use for development of a controller for the remote and autonomous operation at agricultural fields...|$|R
