5|$|Produced by Sara Lee's Douwe Egberts brand, BK Joe was Burger King's coffee {{line that}} was first {{introduced}} in 2001 in North America and later in parts of Europe. Advertised as being made from Arabica coffee, the product was made using Douwe's Cafitesse system, a platform that eschews coffee brewed from ground beans {{in favor of a}} beverage made from a coffee concentrate with hot water added. <b>Sara</b> <b>Lee</b> claims the advantage of the system is that each cup of coffee is made at the time of order with minimal waste and labor. The product was not designed to compete with products from companies such as Starbucks, but was intended to appeal to customers who seek a consistent cup of coffee.|$|E
5|$|The post-patent {{negotiations}} {{were led by}} Moe Nadler. D'Amour no longer had leverage with a patent, but still demanded that Canadian Lady stop using the designs, and return the pattern templates.

This allowed the company to move forward into the 1960s with the brand intact. By the mid-1960s Canadian Lady was exporting and licensing the Wonderbra line to Western Europe, Australia, South Africa, Israel and the West Indies. In the 1970s, Canadelle acquired the remaining worldwide rights to the trademark, and licensed Giltex (a Canadian pantyhose manufacturer acquired by <b>Sara</b> <b>Lee</b> in the 1980s) to use the Wonderbra brand on hosiery in Canada.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the case of}} sustainable coffee as faced by <b>Sara</b> <b>Lee's</b> International Coffee and Tea Division (SL), asking which strategic direction the company should take considering its regulatory, competitive, and societal contexts. More than a decade after sustainable coffee became a strategic issue for SL, emerging public purchasing guidelines seem to exclude the ‘mainstream-market’ policy {{of the company and}} instead favour the Fairtrade standard that embodies a niche approach. The case presents the strategic, organisational, and marketing dimensions, in their international supply-chain and industry dynamics. It raises the question what it means for a large, mainstream, multinational company to move to sustainability when the issues at hand are very complex, when consumer awareness is limited, and when the market for sustainable coffee is not yet mature. Several strategic options are presented, each with their pros and cons, as input for further discussion and research on the paradoxes related to sustainability and international business...|$|R
