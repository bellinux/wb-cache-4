40|$|The {{conventional}} {{approach in}} the theory and econometrics of investment is the partition of gross capital investment in two components: expansion (or net) investment and replacement investment. This thesis examines the latter component. A critical assessment of the literature and the empirical evidence reveal that the prevailing view of replacement known as the "proportional replacement hypothesis" is incorrectly specified and unsatisfactory. This thesis examines a variety of data brought together under the same focus {{for the first time}} and comes up with two important findings. First, firms maintain the operating capacity of their equipment not by replacing the whole of the machine but by replacing worn out or defective parts. The cost of new parts along with that of labour and materials incurred in restoring the operating efficiency of machines are known as "repair expenditures". Data on these expenditures have been collected by Statistics Canada in its investment survey since 1947. Although in effect replacement expenditures, these data are not capitalized by firms and hence do not appear in our conventional investment statistics. Although they account for a significant proportion of capital expenditures they are completely ignored in the theory and econometrics of replacement. Second, expansion and maintenance of production capacity are not the only purposes for which firms invest funds. They also invest for a variety of other purposes, such as modernization, upgrading, retooling, revamping and pollution abatement, for example. These activities lower unit costs of production and enhance the profitability of the firm by initiating or responding to changes in the structure of demand, technology, the prices of factor inputs or the market structure. Such capital expenditures entail changes in capital-output and capital-input specificity. As the real world is characterized by capital and output heterogeneity, structural change therefore implies <b>structural</b> <b>investment.</b> Important policy implications arise from the above findings. Tax incentives may be more effectively utilized when targeted toward firms undertaking <b>structural</b> <b>investment</b> rather than either expansion or replacement. Since repair expenditures are not included in standard investment statistics, the level of investment spending is significantly higher than conventionally thought. Also our capital stock data, particularly net capital figures, may be more deficient than previously presumed...|$|E

The country has abundant natural resources ranging from fertile soils for agriculture, oil and gas, minerals such as gold, bauxite, and tin, to timber and other non-timber forest products. Since the 1990 s, due to the extraction of oil off the coast of Limbe in the Gulf of Guinea, the country’s economic emphasis to some extent has shifted from agriculture to the extraction of oil and gas but revenues from the exploitation of these resources, and from oil in particular, have not been sufficiently channelled into <b>structural</b> <b>investments</b> in infrastructure and the productive sectors (African Development Bank 2013).|$|R
40|$|This paper explores {{contemporary}} {{contradictions and}} tensions in Australian social policy principles and governmental {{practices that are}} being used to drive behavioural change, such as compulsory income management. By means of compulsory income management the Australian Government determines how certain categories of income support recipients can spend their payments through the practice of quarantining a proportion of that payment. In this process some groups in the community, particularly young unemployed people and Indigenous Australians, are being portrayed as requiring a paternalistic push in order to make responsible choices. The poverty experienced by some groups of income support recipients appears {{to be seen as a}} consequence of poor spending patterns rather than economic and social inequalities. By contrast, Australia 2 ̆ 7 s National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) has been constructed as a person centred system of support that recognises the importance of both human agency and <b>structural</b> <b>investment</b> to expand personal choices and control. Here we look at the rationale guiding these developments to explore the tensions and contradictions in social policy more broadly, identifying what would be required if governments sought to promote greater autonomy, dignity and respect for people receiving income support payments in Australia...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{belongs to}} the recent {{investment}} literature focused on the modelling of microeconomic investment decisions. The increasing concern about this topic {{is related to the}} growing availability of microeconomic datasets which show the investment behavior taking place at the firm level. This behavior is far from the smooth capital adjustment pattern derived from the traditional investment models. Rather it is characterized by infrequent and lumpy adjustment. New investment models must be considered to capture this behavior. In this paper we formulate a dynamic <b>structural</b> <b>investment</b> model with irreversibility and nonconvex adjustment costs and try to stress the importance of these costs in the firms' investment decisions. From the methodological point of view, we set the investment decision on the dynamic programming framework. More specifically, we consider a discrete choice dynamic programming problem in which firms decide to invest or not to invest. The estimation strategy we adopt is the Nested Pseudo-Likelihood (NPL) algorithm recently proposed by Aguirregabiria and Mira (2002). It is an estimation method which has clear advantages over previous techniques proposed in this context. Up to our knowledge, this paper constitutes the first empirical application of this estimation method. ...|$|E

The composite index is formed from a suite of economic, demographic, sociological, and environmental variables.

The variables proposed are: future economic growth; future population growth; future population youthfulness; super-normal infrastructure investment; future mortgage growth; latent demand; future climate; supply inelasticity; and cyclical undervaluation. These variables are represented in the composite index by datasets from, respectively: The Atlas of Economic Complexity; United Nations World Population Prospects; Eurostat Europop; European Commission <b>Structural</b> <b>Investment</b> Funding allocation; European Mortgage Federation Hypostat (outstanding loans to disposable income); Eurostat SILC (adults living with parents), and World Bank annual remittance data; Meldelsohn et al.
