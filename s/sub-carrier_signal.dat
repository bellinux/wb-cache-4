The electronic operation of detection effectively shifts the carrier down to 0 Hz, folding the signals with frequencies below the Carrier, on top of the frequencies above the carrier. Thus the upper and lower sidebands are summed. If there is a phase shift between these two, then the combination will have a relative amplitude of (1 + cos φ).

Frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) lidar is a well-known type of lidar used for solid-target detection and ranging with high spatial resolution. The extension of this lidar technique to the probing of distributed media (aerosols, smoke or exhaust fumes) has recently been proposed by the authors. The main drawback in measuring extended or distributed targets with a conventional FMCW signal is the loss of information that occurs in the retrieved signal, as it suffers a bandpass filtering in the detection process. This implies the practical impossibility of recovering the complete information about the target spatial distribution. A shift of the <b>sub-carrier</b> FM modulating <b>signal</b> to baseband can avoid these effects and the desired information can be satisfactorily retrieved if the emitted signal is adequately chosen to avoid sum-frequency components distortion.

The medium is probed with both the classical <b>sub-carrier</b> FM bandpass <b>signal</b> and with the baseband one previously proposed.

HLO-PAL is a conventionally constructed composite signal (Y+C, like NTSC and PAL). It uses a Phase Alternating by Line with Half-Line Offset carrier encoding of the wideband/narrowband chroma components. Only the very lowest part of the wideband chroma component overlapped the high-frequency chroma. The narrowband chroma was completely separated from luminance. PAF, or Phase Alternating by Field (like the first NTSC color system trial) was also experimented with, and gave much better decoding results, but NHK abandoned all composite encoding systems. Because of the use of satellite transmission, Frequency modulation(FM) should be used with power-limitation problem. FM incurs triangular noise, so if a <b>sub-carrierred</b> composite <b>signal</b> is used with FM, demodulated chroma signal has more noise than luminance.

40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} frequency-selective channel conditions, for example fading caused by {{multipath}} propagation, {{can be considered}} as constant (flat) over an OFDM sub-channel if the sub-channel is sufficiently narrow-banded (i. e., if the number of sub-channels is sufficiently large). This makes frequency domain equalization possible at the receiver, which is far simpler than the time-domain equalization used in conventional single-carrier modulation. In OFDM, the equalizer only has to multiply each detected sub-carrier (each Fourier coefficient) in each OFDM symbol by a constant complex number, or a rarely changed value.

Moreover, future wireless systems are expected to support a wide range of services which includes video, data and voice. OFDM is a promising candidate for achieving high data rates in mobile environment because of its multicarrier modulation technique and ability to convert a frequency selective fading channel into several nearly flat fading channels. Now OFDM is being widely used in wireless communications standards, such as IEEE 802. 11 a, the multimedia mobile access communication (MMAC), and the HIPERLAN/ 2. However, one of the main disadvantages of OFDM is its sensitivity against carrier frequency offset which causes inter carrier interference (ICI). A well-known problem of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), however, is its sensitivity to frequency offset between the transmitted and received signals, which may be caused by Doppler shift in the channel, or by the difference between the transmitter and receiver local oscillator frequencies. This carrier frequency offset causes loss of orthogonality between <b>sub-carriers</b> and the <b>signals</b> transmitted on each carrier are not independent of each other.

40|$|OFDM is a {{multicarrier}} {{modulation technique}} {{in which a}} high rate bit stream is split into N parallel bit-streams of lower rate and each of these are modulated using one of N orthogonal sub-carriers. In a basic communication system, the date is modulated onto a single carrier frequency. The available bandwidth is then totally occupied by each symbol. This kind of system can lead to inter-symbol-interference (ISI) in case of frequency selective channel. The basic idea of OFDM is to divide the available spectrum into several orthogonal sub channels so that each narrowband sub channels experiences almost flat fading.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the peak-to-average-power-ratio (PAPR) issue, which {{typically}} affects the digital transmission on power line communication (PLC) systems. In these systems, the power line is exploited as a communication multicarriers channel, where the sub-channels are made mutually independent by using orthogonal frequencies (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing or OFDM). Each component carries a string of bits associated with both amplitude and phase, which then represents the routed information. On the other hand, depending on the phases of the <b>sub-carriers,</b> the OFDM <b>signal</b> which has to be transmitted could present high instantaneous peaks.

This method consists in shifting the phases of the components in order to minimize the amplitude of the peaks. The determination of the optimal set of phase shifts is a very complex problem, so that the SLM approaches proposed in the literature all resort to iterative algorithms to solve it.

It {{is still in its}} design phase, and while the signals have to be finalized, the main specifications have already been confirmed. The Binary Offset Carrier (BOC) modulation is part of the current GALILEO signal plan. A BOC modulation multiplies a spreading code with a square wave sub-carrier that has a frequency multiple of the code rate. It creates a split spectrum with two main lobes shifted from the center frequency by the frequency of the <b>sub-carrier.</b> This modulated <b>signal</b> induces better tracking in white noise and better inherent multipath mitigation compared to the spreading code alone. However, it also makes acquisition more challenging and tracking potentially ambiguous due to its multiple peak autocorrelation function. As a result, an evaluation of its performance under different conditions and research on advanced tracking techniques are necessary to assess its robustness and advantages before final selection. This paper focuses on a specific BOC signal: the BOC(1, 1). Working on a given signal, instead of trying to find a generic solution, offers the possibility to fully exploit this signal's characteristics to find a more relevant way to improve its performance and cancel its bias threat. A new innovative tracking technique dedicated to BOC(n,n) signals has therefore been developed using a synthesized local correlation function. It completely removes the sidepeak threat and allows clean acquisition and tracking of any BOC(n,n) signal while keeping the same sharp correlation main peak. Consequently, it does not need to check if tracking is done on the main peak. It also offers a good resistance to long-delay multipath. The particular case of BOC(1, 1) is taken as an example throughout the paper due to the strong probability that it will be used by the L 1 GALILEO civil signal. Both acquisition and tracking are studied and compared with the standard tracking algorithm, first theoretically and then using simulations...|$|R
