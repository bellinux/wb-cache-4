5|$|La Praz {{received}} its first <b>ski</b> <b>jumping</b> hill in 1944. Ahead of the 1992 Winter Olympics, {{the large and}} normal hills were built along with a cross-country stadium to host <b>ski</b> <b>jumping</b> and Nordic combined events. Since 1997, the hill has hosted an annual summer FIS <b>Ski</b> <b>Jumping</b> Grand Prix event. It has also been used for one FIS <b>Ski</b> <b>Jumping</b> World Cup and two FIS Nordic Combined World Cup rounds, in addition to four events of the FIS <b>Ski</b> <b>Jumping</b> Continental Cup. The medium hill opened in 2004 and the small hill in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The only FIS-sanctioned {{event to}} take place at Igman was <b>ski</b> <b>jumping</b> and Nordic {{combined}} at the 1984 Winter Olympics. The <b>ski</b> <b>jumping</b> competitions doubled {{as a part of}} the FIS <b>Ski</b> <b>Jumping</b> World Cup. The normal hill event was won by East Germany's Jens Weißflog ahead of Nykänen. The two reversed top places in the large hill event. The Nordic combined event was won by Norway's Tom Sandberg ahead of Finland's Jouko Karjalainen and Jukka Ylipulli.|$|E
5|$|Big Thunder <b>Ski</b> <b>Jumping</b> Centre was a twin <b>ski</b> <b>jumping</b> hill {{located in}} Thunder Bay in Northwestern Ontario, Canada. It {{constitutes}} part of Big Thunder National Training Centre. The first hills were built by Knute and Thor Hansen and opened in 1963. They were originally known as Lille Norway Ski Area, then Mt. Norway Ski Area, and Sundance Northwest Resort {{before taking the}} current name. The large and normal hills were built in 1974 and the venue {{was taken over by}} the provincial government in 1985. The hills hosted 29 FIS <b>Ski</b> <b>Jumping</b> World Cup and 50 Canadian <b>Ski</b> <b>Jumping</b> Championships tournaments between 1975 and 1995, climaxing with the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1995. Funding was then cut and the venue has since been closed and unmaintained.|$|E

50|$|Nansen <b>Ski</b> <b>Jump,</b> {{also known}} as The Big Nansen and The Sleeping Giant, is a <b>ski</b> <b>jump</b> located along Route 16 in Milan, New Hampshire. Built in 1936, {{it was the largest}} <b>ski</b> <b>jump</b> of its time. It is now within Nansen <b>Ski</b> <b>Jump</b> State Historic Site, a New Hampshire state park, which also {{features}} a picnic area and boat launch on the Androscoggin River.|$|R

5|$|During the 1994 Winter Olympics, {{the venue}} hosted three <b>ski</b> <b>jumping</b> and two Nordic {{combined}} events, {{in addition to}} the opening and closing ceremonies. Competition evens consisted of individual normal hill, individual large hill, and team large hill in <b>ski</b> <b>jumping,</b> and individual and team small hill for Nordic combined.|$|E
5|$|Events {{under the}} Ski Flying World Cup have several {{differences}} to the Ski Flying World Championships. The latter is an isolated tournament, or one-off event, {{in the same}} vein as the <b>Ski</b> <b>Jumping</b> World Championships and Winter Olympics, whereas the Ski Flying World Cup is part of the overall <b>Ski</b> <b>Jumping</b> World Cup season, and uses the same points system. These points contribute towards both Ski Flying and <b>Ski</b> <b>Jumping</b> World Cup standings; the former being effectively a 'mini season' within the latter. However, a feature shared with the Ski Flying World Championships is that the starting order switches over from the <b>Ski</b> <b>Jumping</b> World Cup standings to the Ski Flying World Cup standings after the first competition of the latter, and remains that way for all subsequent events.|$|E
5|$|The {{rules and}} scoring in ski flying are mostly {{the same as}} they are in <b>ski</b> <b>jumping,</b> and events under the {{discipline}} are usually contested as part of the <b>Ski</b> <b>Jumping</b> World Cup season, but the hills (of which there are only five remaining, all in Europe) are constructed to a different standard in order to enable jumps of up to 66% longer in distance. There is also a stronger emphasis on aerodynamics and harnessing the wind, as well as an increased element of danger due to athletes flying much higher and faster than in <b>ski</b> <b>jumping.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Excluding {{ski flying}} hills, the Pine Mountain <b>Ski</b> <b>Jump</b> {{is the largest}} <b>ski</b> <b>jump</b> in the United States and it is between the 3rd and 8th tallest {{man-made}} <b>ski</b> <b>jump</b> in the world (depending on how height is measured). There are two other <b>ski</b> <b>jumps</b> in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan: Copper Peak is the only Ski flying venue in the western hemisphere, located near Ironwood, Michigan (and has been called [...] "Suicide hill"), {{as well as the}} pre-existing Suicide Hill <b>Ski</b> <b>Jump</b> located at Ishpeming, Michigan, which is near the National Ski Hall of Fame.|$|R

The objective was to verify the model with results from a piloted simulation of a mixed flow, remote lift STOVL aircraft. The prediction model is discussed. The predicted results are compared with the piloted simulation results. The <b>ski</b> <b>jump</b> model can be utilized for basic research of other thrust vectoring STOVL aircraft performing a <b>ski</b> <b>jump</b> takeoff...|$|R
5|$|Lysgårdsbakken is {{a regular}} site for FIS <b>Ski</b> <b>Jumping</b> World Cup and FIS Nordic Combined World Cup tournaments. FIS <b>Ski</b> <b>Jumping</b> World Cup has been hosted nearly every year since 1993. Since 2004, with the {{exception}} of 2007 and 2010, Lysgårdsbakken is a co-host of the Nordic Tournament. The FIS Nordic Combined World Cup has been hosted nine times, in 1993, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2009, and 2010. All tournaments have been held in December; nine of the ten have had the cross-country skiing part held at nearby Birkebeineren Ski Stadium, while in 2001 the cross-country skiing was held at Beitostølen. Lillehammer is scheduled to host the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics, where Lysgårdsbakken would be used for <b>ski</b> <b>jumping</b> and Nordic combined.|$|E
5|$|Papoose Peak Jumps was a <b>ski</b> <b>jumping</b> hill {{located at}} Squaw Valley Ski Resort in the US state of California. The hill {{consisted}} of three jumps, with K-points of 80, 60 and 40 meters, respectively. Constructed upon the hill-side of Little Papoose Peak, it was built for the 1960 Winter Olympics; the 80-meter hill hosted the <b>ski</b> <b>jumping</b> event and the 60-meter hill the Nordic combined event. The jump was designed by Heini Klopfer and opened in 1958. After the Olympics the venue saw little use; it was renovated for the 1976 US National <b>Ski</b> <b>Jumping</b> Championships, but has since fallen into disrepair and demolished {{to make room for}} a ski lift.|$|E
5|$|Ski flying events {{outside of}} the World Championships are a regular feature on the <b>Ski</b> <b>Jumping</b> World Cup calendar, usually {{occurring}} on two or three hills only. Because athletes almost always participate in both disciplines, points scored in ski flying also count towards the <b>Ski</b> <b>Jumping</b> World Cup standings. From 1991 to 2001, and from 2009 onwards, an additional title and trophy – the Ski Flying World Cup – has been awarded {{at the end of}} each season to the overall points winner of solely ski flying competitions, even if only one took place. In contrast to the Ski Flying World Championships, the Ski Flying World Cup is contested as a season. The former can be considered equivalent to the <b>Ski</b> <b>Jumping</b> World Championships, in that both are tournaments staged during the <b>Ski</b> <b>Jumping</b> World Cup season, but are isolated from it; therefore, points from neither are included as part of the World Cup standings.|$|E
50|$|The Wurmberg <b>ski</b> <b>jumps</b> were a {{group of}} <b>ski</b> <b>jumps</b> in the Harz, {{near the town of}} Braunlage in Lower Saxony, central Germany.|$|R
50|$|Suicide Hill <b>Ski</b> <b>Jump</b> is a 90-meter <b>ski</b> <b>jump</b> {{located in}} Negaunee, Michigan, and {{is part of}} the Ishpeming Ski Club. It is one of three major <b>ski</b> <b>jumps</b> located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan (the others being Copper Peak and Pine Mountain <b>Ski</b> <b>Jump).</b> Suicide Hill has been in {{existence}} since 1925. Suicide Hill <b>Ski</b> <b>Jump</b> is located in a small valley known as Suicide Bowl. Suicide Bowl contains a total of five jumps, a 13-meter, 25 meter, 40 meter, 60 meter, and Suicide Hill at 90 meters. The 13 meter and 40 meter jumps are fitted with plastic for summer jumping. All five jumps are used during winter. Suicide Bowl also contains cross-country ski runs.|$|R
40|$|The {{geometry}} of the Planica <b>ski</b> <b>jump</b> was established {{on the basis of}} geodetic measurements. The results of precise measurement were used for the reconstruction of the <b>ski</b> <b>jump</b> during 2003 and 2004. The comparison of results of geodetic measurements with FIS regulations and data of the constructing engineers is represented. On the basis of comparison of theoretical requirements and actual {{geometry of}} the <b>ski</b> <b>jump</b> with and without snow, one can identify the disadvantages of the construction and improve the {{geometry of the}} <b>ski</b> <b>jump...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{hill was}} {{scheduled}} to host two FIS <b>Ski</b> <b>Jumping</b> World Cup events in January 1991, {{but they had to}} be cancelled due to lack of snow. In 1993, the hills hosted a single large hill World Cup event. Since 1997, Tremplin du Praz has been used annually for the FIS <b>Ski</b> <b>Jumping</b> Grand Prix, the premier international summer <b>ski</b> <b>jumping</b> tournament. Originally it consisted of a single competition in the large hill, but from 2010, a qualification run was introduced the day before the main event. The venue has hosted the FIS <b>Ski</b> <b>Jumping</b> Continental Cup four times, in 2000, 2002, 2010 and 2011. In February 2006, the venue hosted two FIS Cup competitions in the normal hill. In January 2007, Courchevel hosted two rounds of a FIS-organized junior ski jump in the normal hill. In Nordic combined, the venue has hosted the FIS Nordic Combined World Cup twice, in 1991 and 1992. It also held a World Cup B event in 1997. The venue has been a popular training venue for national teams, and Germany often holds summer training in Courchevel.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the debut}} of women's <b>ski</b> <b>jumping</b> at these championships, the big winner in the jumping events was Austria with three medals and two each for Wolfgang Loitzl and Gregor Schlierenzauer. Adding the 10km mass start, the Nordic {{combined}} format was changed from 7.5km sprint and 15km individual Gundersen to 10km individual large hill (aka Large hill Gundersen) and 10km individual normal hill (aka Normal hill Gundersen), respectively. Estonia's Andrus Veerpalu became the oldest gold medalist at 38 when he won gold in the men's 15km event. Despite concern over the lack of snowfall that plagued event preparation prior to the championships, the championships themselves had an abundance of snowfall and wind that caused the <b>ski</b> <b>jumping</b> part of the Nordic combined mass start to be postponed {{for a day and}} the <b>ski</b> <b>jumping</b> individual large hill competition to be limited to one jump.|$|E
5|$|In Lillehammer, Lysgårdsbakkene <b>Ski</b> <b>Jumping</b> Arena {{features}} twin <b>ski</b> <b>jumping</b> hills. The large hill has a hill size of 138 and a K-point of 120, {{while the}} normal hill has a hill size of 100 and {{a critical point}} of 90. The hill has capacity for 35,000 spectators and hosted, {{in addition to the}} <b>ski</b> <b>jumping</b> events, the opening and closing ceremonies. Birkebeineren Ski Stadium featured cross-country skiing and biathlon, with the stadium itself having a capacity for 31,000 spectators during cross-country skiing and 13,500 during biathlon. In addition, spectators could watch from along the tracks. For the cross-country men's 4 × 10 km relay, over 203,000 people applied for the 31,000 seats. Kanthaugen Freestyle Arena featured a capacity for 15,000 spectators. All the outdoor skiing arenas had free areas, which saw up to 25,000 extra spectators at the team jump and 75,000 extra spectators at the 50km.|$|E

[...] The Minneapolis Ski Club will be hosting the 2013 Junior National competition.|$|R
50|$|The area {{formerly}} had a 50-60 meter Nordic <b>ski</b> <b>jump</b> on {{its lower}} north slope, near the {{bend in the}} highway. The aging jump was destroyed by a microburst wind in the 1990s. A 25-30 meter Nordic <b>ski</b> <b>jump</b> is still in use.|$|R
5|$|In {{this event}} {{there is a}} {{qualification}} round on the opening day, in which 40 to 70 athletes each jump once to ensure their place {{for the rest of}} the event's two individual competitions. 40 of these places are available in the first competition (compared to 50 in the similar <b>Ski</b> <b>Jumping</b> World Championships), which is narrowed down to 30 for the second competition. The order of jumps – or 'starting order' – in the qualification round is based on the athletes' current rank within the <b>Ski</b> <b>Jumping</b> World Cup standings in ascending order of points, with the leader (who is assigned a distinctive yellow bib) going last. A unique feature of the World Cup, which applies to all ski flying and <b>ski</b> <b>jumping</b> events, is that the top ten ranked athletes are in a 'pre-qualified' bracket: their place in the event is already secure, so their qualification jump is entirely optional.|$|E
5|$|The <b>ski</b> <b>jumping</b> venue {{took place}} at Ještěd which has two hills that were already to FIS specifications. The normal hill size (HS) was 100m (HS100) while the large hill size was 134m (HS134). Both hills were used for FIS <b>ski</b> <b>jumping</b> World Cup venues with Finnish ski jumper Janne Ahonen holding the record jump of 139m on the HS134 hill in 2004. Modifications were done to the outrun and data was {{gathered}} on the wind flow within the <b>ski</b> <b>jumping</b> area from January to March for 2006 to 2009. At the fall 2007 meeting in Zurich {{during the week of}} 24 September 2007, it was announced by the Organizing Committee that construction was proceeding according to schedule, with completion in mid-December 2007. The test event for Jested took place on 8–9 February 2008. A grandstand of 10,000 spectators was constructed in order to have night time <b>ski</b> <b>jumping</b> the weekend of 9–10 February 2008. The hill suffered a landslide caused by continuous rainfall around the hill during the week of 28 January 2008, but the outrun was not affected by the event, according to Liberec mayor Jiri Kittner. On 1 February, Neumannová stated that the <b>ski</b> <b>jumping</b> events took place as scheduled. The lift to the ski jump that was not working during the FIS World Cup B Nordic combined event in January was fixed. The winners of the <b>ski</b> <b>jumping</b> test event at the HS134 hill were Thomas Morgenstern of Austria on 8 February and Anders Jacobsen of Norway on 9 February. An Alpen Cup competition took place on the weekend of 20–21 December 2008 to have final test procedures and infrastructure for the championships. As of 14 January 2009, the main grandstand was complete while the teams worked on proper shaping of the hills for use. The large hill was closed while the normal hill was designated for ski jumper and Nordic combined athlete training. Further construction during the week of 19 January 2009 included spectator stairs {{on the side of the}} hill, mobile containers for the athletes and their service teams; and a spectator catering tent was set up.|$|E
5|$|Unlike <b>ski</b> <b>jumping,</b> {{which can}} be contested in the summer on {{specially}} equipped hills, ski flying is strictly a winter sport and {{not part of the}} Winter Olympics; no world records have therefore been set at the games. Also in contrast to <b>ski</b> <b>jumping,</b> athletes are not able to practice on ski flying hills out-of-season, as they are used only for competition events. Among the Alpine countries there is an unwritten gentlemen's agreement forbidding athletes under the age of 18 to participate in ski flying events, although an exception was made for 17-year-old Domen Prevc in 2017.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>ski</b> <b>jump,</b> called Kastellbakken, {{was viewed}} as {{gigantic}} for its time, with length around 20 meters readily achieved. At the first recognized competition held in Husebybakken in 1879, Olaf Haugann of Norway set the first world record for the longest <b>ski</b> <b>jump</b> at 20 meters.|$|R
5000|$|In 1931, the Okurayama <b>Ski</b> <b>Jump</b> Stadium was {{constructed}} by Kishichiro Okura with an advice {{and financial aid}} of Prince Chichibu, a brother of Hirohito, and was donated to Sapporo after the completion. Another name [...] "Ōkurayama-Schanze" [...] originated with the inauguration ceremony in 1931, when the mayor of Sapporo at that time, Masaharu Hashimoto, named the <b>ski</b> <b>jump</b> as [...] "Ōkura Schanze" [...] after its founder. The term schanze means <b>ski</b> <b>jump</b> in German. The construction of the stadium {{was supported by a}} director of the Norwegian team in 1928 Winter Olympics.|$|R
5|$|In Lillehammer's {{bids for}} the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics, Balbergbakken was the {{proposed}} site of <b>ski</b> <b>jumping.</b> Lillehammer {{was awarded the}} 1994 Olympics in 1988, but a year later the plans to use Balbergbanen were abandoned. The venue was regarded as unsuitable; for instance NOK30 million {{would have to be}} spent on building a new access road. In addition, a new water and sewer system, new stands, participant facilities and a normal hill would have to be built. The available space at Balbergbakken was limited, and the organizers saw it as advantageous to have the ski stadium close to the <b>ski</b> <b>jumping</b> hills.|$|E
5|$|Skiing in Revelstoke {{started in}} 1890 with {{the influx of}} Norwegian {{immigrants}} who brought with them their tradition of home-made skies. By the early 1910s, <b>ski</b> <b>jumping</b> was a major pastime during winter, with small ski jumps being built all around the town. Revelstoke Ski Club was founded in 1914 and reached 102 members within a year. Starting in 1915, the club's annual high point was the Winter Carnival Tournament. The first tournament was held in 1915, and featured competitions in cross-country skiing and <b>ski</b> <b>jumping</b> for boys under 16, and awarded the title of Champion of British Columbia. The inaugurate tournament was won by Nels Nelson.|$|E
