40|$|Abstract: Glacial hazards such as ice avalanches, glacial lake {{outburst}} floods, {{and debris}} flows have caused severe damage in populated mountain regions {{such as the}} Swiss Alps. Assessment of such hazards must consider basic glaciological, geomorphological, and hydraulic principles together with experience gained from previous events. An ap-proach is presented here to assess the maximum event magnitude and probability of occurrence of glacial hazards. Analysis of magnitude is based on empirical relationships derived from published case histories from the Swiss Alps and other mountain regions. Probability of occurrence is difficult to estimate because of rapid changes {{in the nature of}} glacial systems, the low frequency of events, and the high complexity of the involved processes. Here, the probability is specified in qualitative and <b>systematic</b> <b>terms</b> based on indicators such as dam type, geometry, and freeboard height (for glacial lakes) and tendency of avalanche repetition, precursor events, and increased water supply to the glacier bed (for ice avalanche events). The assessment procedures are applied to a recent lake outburst with subsequent debris flow and to an ice avalanche in the Swiss Alps. The results yield reasonable event maxima that were not exceeded by actual events. The methods provide first-order assessments and may be applied in dynamic mountain environments where population and infrastructure growth require continuous evaluation of hazards.

Popularly, the “internetês” is known as “portuguese language as written on the internet”, characterized by word simplifications that would consider, in the formation process, the spoken genre (the non-standard and stigmatized varieties) of language, rather than the written genre (the standard and prestigious varieties).

CRISTA-NF operated aboard the high-altitude research aircraft M- 55 Geophysica. Mid-infrared spectra (4 - 15 mu m) were measured in the limb sounding geometry with high spatial resolution (250 m vertical sampling, 5 - 15 km along track sampling). Measurements were carried out during transfer flights between Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany, and Darwin, Australia, as well as during several local flights near Darwin. Water vapor volume mixing ratios in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere were derived from the CRISTA-NF radiance measurements by utilizing a rapid radiative transfer forward model and the optimal estimation retrieval approach. CRISTA-NF water vapor measurements below the hygropause have a total retrieval error of 15 - 40 % (i. e. root mean square of accuracy and precision). The <b>systematic</b> <b>terms</b> are dominating in the retrieval error budget. The contributions of a priori information to the retrieval results are less than 5 - 10 %. The vertical resolution of the observations is about 250 - 500 in when permitted by instrument sampling. In this paper we present first results for three transfer flights of the campaign. Being generally in good agreement with corresponding ECMWF operational analyzes, the CRISTA-NF measurements show significantly higher variability and local structures in the upper tropospheric water vapor distributions.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{challenge}} the tradition of theories of law to be theories of legal system. It argues that the frequently criticized individual failings of these theories are due to their common mistake in attempting to understand law in systematic forms at all. "Positivist" systems are composed of rules, norms or reasons (Hart, Harris and Raz respectively). These are linked into structured wholes by their sources. Dworkin's "Content" system links the content of "principles" into a whole which provides the "best justification" law. It is argued that {{from the point of}} view of legal actors, let al social observers, neither kind of legal system adequately encompasses describes law. Sociological theories of legal system are usually systems of individual roles and institutional functions that jointly perform the social function of law. These are rejected because legal institutions rarely fulfil their allotted function, yet do so much else besides. A non-systematic theory of society is then proposed. This helps explain why law, as a key part of that society, is unlikely to be understood in <b>systematic</b> <b>terms.</b> It also provides a model for a nonsystematic theory of law. Both law and society are seen to comprise three kinds of social relations, power (including authority), unintended effect, and value-effect (including norms). Unpatterned sets of relations found between persons in more frequent or intense interaction with each other than outsiders form institutions. These social relations are such that they generate disordered conflict within and between institutions, the former muting the latter. Law is seen as a set of institutions that are part of, and subject to, that conflict. It holds a special place within society because much of the conflict is channelled through the social relations within law. </p...|$|E

40|$|Sur la base d'une revue sélective de la littérature, les auteurs présentent un modèle conceptuel des déterminants de la validité ou de l’exactitude des évaluations du rendement. Trois {{variables}} majeures sont identifiées: (1) la motivation de l'évaluateur; (2) son habileté; ainsi que (3) la possession de normes ou standards d'évaluation. D'autres variables sont présentées à titre d'antécédents et viennent compléter le modèle conceptuel. In this article, a literature-based {{model of}} the determinants of the validity or accuracy of performance ratings is presented. In this model, the dependent variable {{is a set of}} ratings on a performance appraisal instrument, the accuracy of which is shown to be affected by several independent variables. The purposes of the article are to (1) organize the relevant literature in terms of existing theory ; (2) provide a set of propositions bearing on appraisal problems ; and finally, (3) increase our understanding and control of this important process in organizations. MAJOR COMPONENTS OF THE CONCEPTUAL MODELBased on Taft's theory of interpersonal judgment, the model indicates that the major determinants of accuracy are: (a) rater motivation; (b) rater ability; and (c) availability of the appropriate judgmental norms. Then, a first proposition follows:Accurate performance ratings are most likely to occur when the rater is motivated to rate accurately, uses the appropriate rating standards, and has the ability to correctly interpret ratee job behavior in terms of these standards. The respective determinants of each of the three major variables are then presented, and propositional implications are discussed, always with a focus on the dependent variable: performance appraisal accuracy. RATER MOTIVATIONSix possible determinants of rater motivation are considered. Without regard to the order of their importance, they are: (1) the perceived consequences of accurate ratings for both the rater and the ratee ; (2) rater perceptions of the adequacy of the performance appraisal instrument used; (3) the relevant organizational policies and practices; (4) the rating format itself; (5) the availability of appropriate standards of performance; and (6) the purpose of appraisal. A conclusion derived from the ensuing discussion {{is that most of the}} consequences for the rater of assigning accurate performance ratings appear to be negative. It should not be surprising, therefore, that many raters approach the performance appraisal event with reluctance and assign inaccurate ratings. Another conclusion is that if the content of a performance appraisal instrument is based on job analysis, it will have the potential of being both face and content valid and thereby of having a positive impact on rater perceptions of its adequacy for the purpose at hand. RATER ABILITYFour determinants of rater ability are discussed. They are (1) the rater's opportunity to observe ratee job behavior; (2) some of the rater's characteristics ; (3) rater training, and (4) the availability of the appropriate rating standards. Among other things, it is concluded that the more opportunities to observe ratee job behavior the rater takes advantage of, the higher his or her ability to assign accurate performance ratings. Also, the closer the rater's organizational level is to the rater's organizational level, the higher the rater's ability to assign accurate performance ratings. Finally, raters trained in the principles and problems of performance appraisal are presented as having higher ability to assign accurate ratings than untrained raters. AVAILABILITY OF APPROPRIATE RATING STANDARDSIn the model, the availability of appropriate rating standards is viewed as a function of: (1) ratee job characteristics; (2) ratee personal characteristics; (3) appraisal format used; and (4) organizational policies and procedures with respect to performance appraisal. It is suggested that organizational policies and procedures could be used to tip the balance of consequences in favor of accurate ratings if the rater perceives that he or she will be held accountable for the ratings assigned. CONCLUSIONPerformance appraisal literature and research have had a strong tendency to focus on instrumentation at the expense of other, perhaps more important variables. Current research on topics such as rater training, rating simulation, rater motivation, however, indicate that researchers are pursuing other promising avenues for future research. The model presented is an initial attempt to view performance appraisal in <b>systematic</b> <b>terms.</b> As such, its purpose is to stimulate further research and thought on performance appraisal as a process of interpersonal judgment...|$|E

40|$|Calanus finmarchicus {{sensu lato}} {{belongs in the}} order Copepoda of the class Crustacea. It is {{probably}} the most widespread marine copepod, being found throughout the world in all but the tropical seas. Over much of its distribution it is the dominant member of the zooplankton and {{is an essential part of}} the food web on which many economically important fish depend. An understanding of its ecology will play a fundamental part in the scientific management of fisheries. The aim of the thesis is to attempt an understanding of certain aspects of this vast subject. The scope of the thesis has been broadened, paradoxically perhaps, by previous work which has produced various opinions on the systematic status of populations in different water masses. It has been necessary, therefore, to define the main populations in <b>systematic</b> <b>terms</b> and then to use these definitions in a number of ecological studies. The scientific history of Galanus finmarchicus s. l, began two hundred years ago with its discovery and description, as Monoculus finmarchicus, by Gunnerus. Today it has been suggested that it should be regarded as a complex of seven species, each characteristic of different water masses. Three of these, C, finmarchicus, sensu stricto, C. glacialis and G. helgolandicus are known from the North Atlantic and they form the subject of the present investigations. Morphological separation of these species is based mainly on the structure of the fifth (last) pair of limbs; in adult females and stage V copepodids the shape of the inner border of the coxopodite and the size of the teeth on this border are the main characters. In C. finmarchicus the teeth are small and the border approximately straight; C. glacialis, which is larger than the other two, also has small teeth on a concave border; and C. helgolandicus has larger teeth on a strongly concave border. Adult males are distinguished mainly by different proportional lengths of the rami of this pair of limbs. The material for the investigations has come for the most part from samples obtained by the Continuous Plankton Recorder in the course of the Survey of the North Atlantic and North Sea conducted from the Oceanographic Laboratory, Edinburgh; these samples have all been taken at a depth of 10 m. Some experimental work was carried out at the Marine Station, Millport, in the Firth of Clyde, and net samples obtained during the International NORWESTLANT Surveys of 1963 have formed the basis for two ecological studies. Mixed samples formed the basis for the comparisons of G. finmarchicus with C. glacialis and C. helgolandicus. The routine analysis conducted by the staff of the Oceanographic Laboratory provided the information on occurrence necessary for the selection of samples. Measurements were taken of metasome length and of all features of the fifth limbs mentioned in previous descriptions; the most important of these was the curvature of the toothed border, but the number and size of teeth and the presence or absence of an extra seta on the endopodite were included as well. These characters were all considered in relation to metasome length and, in the case of curvature of the toothed border, an angular measure was devised which also took account of size. The results showed that there was little difference in length between G. finmarchicus and C. helgolandicus, the mean for the latter being slightly greater; values for tooth size also overlapped but there was complete separation between the two on the basis of curvature. This separation held good when measurements were made of over a thousand specimens from a wide range of different positions in the North Atlantic and North Sea. The mixed sample of C. finmarchicus and C. glacialis showed a bimodal length frequency but continuity of all morphological characters, including curvature, in relation to length. The experimental investigations demonstrated inverse relationships between length and temperature and between concavity and temperature. The individuals in the experiment thus tended at low temperatures towards features characteristic of C. glacialis. These results are considered, on the one hand, to support the specific separation of C. finmarchicus from C. helgolandicus, as is now widely accepted, but, on the other, to indicate that the apparent differences between G. finmarchicus and G. glacialis are the result of scarcity of specimens of intermediate size and that the characters are affected by temperature. The scarcity of individuals of intermediate size is considered to be explicable in terms of the comparatively small quantities of stable sub-Arctic water compared with the North Atlantic and the Arctic. Since recent authors have shown G. glacialis to be zoogeographically distinct from C. finmarchi cus, it is proposed to retain the former as a subspecies of G. finmarchicus. In introducing the ecological studies, results are presented which were obtained from a series of plankton samples taken during the NORWESTLANT Surveys. These demonstrate above all the dominance of GaJLanus fÂ« finmarchicus among the herbivorous copepods in the region south-west of Greenland. In addition to C. f. finmarchicus and G. f. glacialis, ten species of larger copepods (greater than 3 mm in body length) were obtained and the distribution and abundance of each is recorded. The occurrence of each species is analysed further in relation to sea temperature and depth in a way which enabled them to be classified as warm, intermediate or cold water and as slope, intermediate or oceanic species. It is suggested that the temperature characteristics of C. f. finmarchicus indicate that the sampled population is relatively stenothermic. The primary aim of the Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey is zoogeographical and the abundance of Galanus finmarchicus s. l. makes it an ideal subject for distributional studies even in the areas to have come most recently within the Survey. Charts of distribution show that C. f. glacialis occurs only in those areas influenced by an outflow from the Arctic,i. e. the Labrador and Greenland coastal currents; that G. f. finmarchicus is found throughout the Survey area except for the extreme south-east and is most abundant in the colder oceanic regions of the North Atlantic; and that C. helgolandicus is a more southerly form which is most common in the south-east of the Survey area and in the waters of the Gulf Stream System. Low numbers of each form are generally found during the winter months. In spring, C. f, glacialis is the first to increase in numbers near the surface, starting in the regions most strongly affected by the Labrador Current and later in the more mixed waters south of the Newfoundland Grand Banks, G, f. finmarchicus is next to increase, first in the southern coastal areas and later further north and out into the open ocean, G, helgolandicus is last to increase in numbers, starting in the south and becoming progressively later towards the north. Where they overlap, C. f, finmarchicus is the spring-summer form, G. helgolandicus the summer-autumn one. Annual fluctuations in numbers are, with a few exceptions, closely similar throughout the Survey area. The most notable exception concerns C. f. finmarchicus on the Grand Banks where the cycle is a complete inversion of the typical pattern. The Continuous Plankton Recorder provides samples which can also be used in a detailed investigation of the ecology of abundant epiplanktonic species in a part of the Survey area. In the present study the annual cycle of C. f. finmarchicus on the continental shelf between Newfoundland and the Gulf of Maine has been investigated, as well as some aspects of the relationships with temperature and phytoplankton. There are two main generations in the year, in spring and summer, and a suggestion of a third one in the autumn. Timing was a little earlier in the vicinity of the Gulf of Maine than further to the north-east. Copepodids showed clearer relationships with environmental conditions than did adults, presumably because they had had less time to encounter and be affected by different conditions. An inverse relationship was apparent between metasome length of stage V and sea surface temperature two months previously. Fluctuations in the estimated biomass of younger copepodids (stages I - IV) closely followed those of estimates of the total phytoplankton at all times of year except the spring; in the four months from March to June the increase in phytoplankton was at first greatly in excess of that of young Calanus, to be followed two months later by signs of overgrazing before the balance was achieved again in July. It is suggested that the total biomass of Galanus did not fluctuate greatly through the year; stocks increased steadily during spring and summer and became depleted just as steadily during late autumn and winter. Hensen net samples taken in April, June and July, 1963 Â» during the NORWESTLAMT Surveys, formed the basis for an investigation of the speed and geographical pattern of development of C. f> finmarchicus in the waters around Greenland. The spring generation, the only important one in the year, began almost simultaneously throughout the area. It is suggested that light, rather than temperature, was associated with maturation of the population. Thereafter the speed of development varied from region to region, so that in July the generation was most advanced in the open Atlantic and southern Labrador Sea, less advanced further north and in shallower water. A temperature effect was apparent in this pattern. It was possible to define three regions within the Survey area, namely the Labrador Sea and Baffin Bay, the Irminger Sea south to the Reykjanes Ridge, and the open Atlantic south-east of the Ridge, The relationships between sea temperature and the speed of development of Galanus in each region differed in such a way that, for a given temperature, development was fastest in the Labrador Sea and slowest in the open Atlantic, This is taken to indicate acclimatisation of the populations in each of the three regions. It is suggested that in this way populations of Galanus f. finmarchicus can complete a generation during the summer months, both in the cold water of the Labrador Sea and in water, some 8 - 11 C warmer, in the open Atlantic. In conclusion, the importance of the population as the basic unit in ecological investigations is emphasised. A high degree of ecotypic adaptation of populations is suggested as the means whereby Calanus finmarchicus s. l. has become widely distributed and reached high levels of abundance. Prominence must be given, therefore, to the identification of such populations in future studies. The vitality and adaptability of this copepod remain to be explained in terms of a wide range of biological disciplines. </p...|$|E
