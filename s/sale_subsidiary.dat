Data were collected by in-depth interviews with machine tool importers, interpreted qualitatively and related to conventional theoretical approaches.

40|$|This article explores {{differences}} between three entry modes [...] <b>sales</b> <b>subsidiaries,</b> agents and distributors [...] along four dimensions [...] trust, commitment, marketing control and performance. It is posited that trust, commitment, marketing control and performance are highest in integrated modes (like <b>sales</b> <b>subsidiaries)</b> and lowest in distributor relationships, the agency solution being situated somewhere in between. These hypotheses are {{tested in a}} sample of 260 exporter intermediary relations of 120 Norwegian exporters. Concerning marketing control the hypotheses are confirmed. On the other hand [...] there is virtually no difference between agents and distributors on two other dimensions: trust and commitment. Here the dividing line goes between integrated and independent channels. Concerning financial performance, there is {{no significant difference between the}} three modes of entry. However, integrated modes of entry seem to meet exporter expectations better than independent solutions regarding the more general performance measure, 'goal achievement'. Implications for research and management are discussed. Exports Integrated channels Independent channels Agents Distributors <b>Sales</b> <b>subsidiaries</b> Relationships Performance Control...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} a recent revival of {{interest}} in the geographic component of firm strategy. Recent research suggests that two opposing forces [...] competition costs and agglomeration benefits [...] determine whether firms collocate in a given geographic market. Unexplored is (1) whether these forces have different impacts on R& D, production, and <b>sales</b> <b>subsidiaries,</b> leading to diverse collocation levels, and (2) how firm capabilities impact collocation by increasing or decreasing competition costs and agglomeration benefits. I explore these questions using the worldwide location decisions of firms in the cellular handset industry. I find that production and <b>sales</b> <b>subsidiaries</b> are more geographically dispersed, and R& D subsidiaries are more concentrated, than a random distribution would predict. When distinguishing firms by their capabilities, I find that more-capable firms collocate less than less-capable firms, regardless of the activity performed.
