It operated as a self-sufficient settlement, and even exported some of its produce to the mainland, including bricks for many of Brisbane's buildings, clothes to be sold in Brisbane, and white rope for ships, which was made from imported <b>Sisal</b> <b>Hemp</b> plants. In the island workshops the prisoners were taught such trades as carpentry, boot making, tailoring, tinsmith, saddle making, bread baking and butchery. The island boasted a prize dairy herd which won many awards at the Brisbane Exhibitions. The island was extensively farmed, particularly in the later years as a prison. Maize, potatoes, lucerne and other vegetables thrived in the rich volcanic soil and the sugar mill crushed over 75 tons of locally grown sugar annually by 1880. In many ways, St Helena was regarded as a model prison for the times, and held in high regard by visiting interstate and overseas penologists.|$|E
50|$|Hair {{is used in}} plaster as {{a binding}} medium, and gives {{tenacity}} to the material. Traditionally horsehair was {{the most commonly used}} binder, as it was easily available before the development of the motor-car. Hair functions {{in much the same way}} as the strands in fiberglass resin, by controlling and containing any small cracks within the mortar while it dries or when it is subject to flexing. Ox-hair, which is sold in three qualities, is now the kind usually specified; but horsehair, which is shorter, is sometimes substituted or mixed with the ox-hair in the lower qualities. Good hair should be long (In the UK cow and horse hair of short and long lengths is used), and left greasey (lanolin grease) because this protects against some degradation when introduced into the very high alkaline plaster1. Before use it must be well beaten, or teased, to separate the lumps. In America, goats' hair is frequently used, though it is not so strong as ox-hair. The quantity used in good work is one pound of hair to two or three cubic feet of coarse stuff (in the UK up to 12 kg per metric cube). Hair reinforcement in lime plaster is common, and many types of hair and other organic fibres can be found in historic plasters 4. However, organic material in lime will degrade in damp environments, particularly on damp external renders.5 This problem has given rise to the use of polyprolene fibres in new lime renders 6. Research presented at the UK Building Limes Forum 2012 looked at the potential for hair degradation in lime plasters. Manila hemp fiber has been used as a substitute for hair. Plaster for hair slabs made with manila hemp fiber broke at 195 lb (88 kg), plaster mixed with <b>sisal</b> <b>hemp</b> at 150 lb (68 kg), jute at 145 lb (66 kg), and goats' hair at 144 lb (65 kg).

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades the use of natural fibre-reinforced polymer {{composites}} (NFCs) has received increased attention and found application in many engineering fields: automotive, trains, marine and aeronautics. In fact, natural fibres, such as flax, cotton, <b>sisal,</b> <b>hemp,</b> etc., have many advantages compared to glass fibres, such as low density, recyclability and cost. Additionally they are renewable raw materials and have high specific strength and stiffness. Their low-density values allow producing composites that combine good mechanical properties with a low specific mass. The present thesis is focussed on characterisation of bio-based structures made of flax fibres reinforced polyethylene resin. The main aim of this dissertation is to evaluate the performance, in terms of vibroacoustic properties, of these structures in order to replace the conventional ones in engineering applications where high load levels are not expected. Several panels were manufactured and tested. Firstly the mechanical properties were carried out {{by means of the}} static tests.

This increased the use of natural fibres in composite materials. Natural fibers have recently become more attractive to researchers, engineers and scientists as an alternative reinforcement for fiber reinforced polymer composites. Due to their low cost, low density, stiffness, fairly good mechanical properties, high specific strength, non-abrasive, eco-friendly and biodegradable characteristics, they are exploited as a replacement for the conventional fiber, such as glass, aramid and carbon. The tensile properties of natural fiber reinforced polymers (both thermoplastics and thermosets) are mainly influenced by the interfacial adhesion between the matrix and the fibers.

40|$|Recently, {{many studies}} have been {{conducted}} on exploitation of natural materials for modern product development and bioengineering applications. Apart from plant-based materials (such as <b>sisal,</b> <b>hemp,</b> jute, bamboo and palm fibre), animal-based fibre is a kind of sustainable natural materials for making novel composites. Silkworm silk fibre extracted from cocoon has been well recognized as a promising material for bio-medical engineering applications because of its superior mechanical and bioresorbable properties. However, when producing silk fibre reinforced biodegradable/bioresorbable polymer composites, hydrophilic sericin has been found to cause poor interfacial bonding with most polymers and thus, it results in affecting the resultant properties of the composites. Besides, sericin layers on fibroin surface may also cause an adverse effect towards biocompatibility and hypersensitivity to silk for implant applications. Therefore, a proper pre-treatment should be done for sericin removal. Degumming is a surface modification process which allows a wide control of the silk fibre's properties, making the silk fibre possible to be used for the development and production of novel bio-composites with unique/specific mechanical and biodegradable properties. In this paper, a cleaner and environmentally friendly surface modification technique for tussah silk in polymer based composites is proposed. The effectiveness of different degumming parameters including degumming time and temperature on tussah silk is discussed through the analyses of their mechanical and morphological properties. Based on results obtained, {{it was found that the}} mechanical properties of tussah silk are affected by the degumming time due to the change of the fibre structure and fibroin alignment. ...|$|E

Especially confusing is the phrase “Indian hemp, ” which has been used both for narcotic Asian land races of C. sativa (so-called C. indica Lamarck of India) and Apocynum cannabinum L., which was used by North American Indians as a fiber plant. Cannabis sativa is a multi-purpose plant that has been domesticated for bast (phloem) fiber in the stem, a multi-purpose fixed oil in the “seeds ” (achenes), and an intoxicating resin secreted by epidermal glands. The common names hemp and marijuana (much less frequently spelled marihuana) have been applied loosely to all three forms, although historically hemp has been used primarily for the fiber cultigen and its fiber preparations, and marijuana for the drug cultigen and its drug preparations. The current hemp industry is making great efforts to point out that “hemp is not marijuana. ” Italicized, Cannabis refers to the biological name of the plant (only one species of this genus is commonly recognized, C. sativa L.). Non-italicized, “cannabis ” is a generic abstraction, widely used as a noun and adjective, and commonly (often loosely) used both for cannabis plants and/or any or all of the intoxicant preparations made from them.
