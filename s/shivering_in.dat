25|$|Ondine bears a {{resemblance}} to The Little Mermaid. The story derives from Fouqué's novella Undine, {{the tale of}} a water-nymph who marries a mortal. Similar to other 19th century fairy tales, the plot is based on man (Palemon) encountering the supernatural (the water nymph Ondine), but the outcome is rather different from many of the 19th century classics: here, it is the man that dies, and the female character survives. Ondine makes her first entrance from a fountain, <b>shivering</b> <b>in</b> the cold air as we would in water. She meets the hero, Palemon, and is astonished when she feels his heartbeat as she doesn't possess a heart. Palemon deserts Berta, whom he has been courting, and decides to marry Ondine. During a particularly strong storm while at sea, Ondine is lost overboard. Palemon survives the shipwreck created by the angry Ondines and believing Ondine is lost ends up marrying Berta. Ondine returns and is heartbroken when she discovers Palemon's unfaithfulness. When she kisses him, he dies and she brings his body back into the sea with her forever.|$|E

[...] Past He Dog’s Village; past one-room log cabins with broken and rusted farm implements strewn about, mostly with a tepee on the outside, ground uncultivated and dead; nothing green. [...] Past a little church once painted white, cross on a low steeple, and set {{in a field of}} little white crosses, reminder of sad ending of babies and youth unable to survive in the environment denominated “reservation” by a “charitable” government. [...] Even jack rabbits and birds were absent in this long desolation. [...] But it was good enough for Indians by the white man’s laws. [...] Miles and miles, and finally a little creek bed was crossed to a service pump, and tiny store, it was Brennan, P.O., and just at the rear was the little monument {{at the head of the}} trench where the soldiers who murdered them, buried the frozen bodies of men, women and children to the number of two hundred and ninety, shot down with machine guns to let lie for two days in sub-zero storms (90 men 200 women and children). In one pile of bodies were two mothers whose babes were clasped close to the breast and within their heavy blanket shawls. [...] When tearing the heap of frozen dead apart to be loaded into army wagons for transport to the big ditch, the two babes were found to be alive.” [...] “This was the ‘revenge’ of the troops for the wiping out of Custer’s army at the Little Big Horn fourteen years before, but it was a discreditable show for the great United States Army to thus turn Hotchkiss machine guns on a crowd of starving and helpless and wholly harmless women and children! [...] History has not, even to this late day, justified it. [...] Many of the former acquaintances and friends of the writer were present, and some of them were killed.” [...] “It was a depressing sight for the writer who could in memory review the surrounded band in rags, <b>shivering</b> <b>in</b> cold and weak from irrepressible hunger over months of fruitless search for game to supply them what was denied them by crooked agents and grafting politicians, and had been trailed like wild animals by the relentless army, and finally driven, like cattle to the slaughter, at the unattractive fields we gazed upon.” ...|$|E
