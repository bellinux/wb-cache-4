5|$|A four-part series {{published}} between August and November 1996, Venom: The Hunger {{introduces the}} Venom symbiote's reliance on phenethylamine for survival (which requires it to eat human brains after depleting Brock's {{supply of the}} chemical) and reveals that chocolate {{is a source of}} the chemical. Brock refuses to eat human brains; the <b>symbiote</b> abandons him, and he is locked in an asylum under the care of the deranged Dr. Paine. Brock escapes to hunt the <b>symbiote,</b> which has gone on a killing spree to obtain brains. He reunites with the <b>symbiote</b> (after finding an alternative source of the chemical), but Paine steals the <b>symbiote</b> for himself. Brock frees the <b>symbiote,</b> and again becomes Venom.|$|E
5|$|In Philadelphia, Thompson gains {{employment}} {{as a high}} school gym coach, while as Venom he comes into conflict with the U-Foes, who kidnap and experiment on victims with alien technology. When the U-Foes knock Venom, the demon takes control of his body and uses the alien technology to teleport the villains to their apparent death in space. Kiernan and Thompson's lover Valkyrie later return home, leaving Venom alone. Brock returns as Toxin in Venom #30, to pursue Thompson while he himself is hunting the result of one of the U-Foes experiments: an alien-lifeform infested human turned into a cannibal. Thompson and Brock's fight liberates the aliens who begin infecting and transforming other humans to target their new enemies: Venom and Toxin. Together, Thompson and Brock defeat the aliens, and afterwards Brock calls a truce with Thompson, promising that the Venom <b>symbiote</b> will inevitably take over Thompson, and that he will return to kill him when that happens. Venom #39 sees the return of Jack, and the introduction of the new <b>symbiote</b> character Mania—Thompson's teenage student Andi who bonds with a spawn of the Venom <b>symbiote</b> when Thompson uses it to protect her from Jack. Jack kills Mania's father, and is revealed to be merely a man who was brainwashed by some of Jack's technology into believing he is the real Jack. According to Bunn, when he envisioned a new <b>symbiote</b> character Andi was not intended to be the host, but as the series progressed his plans changed. It is revealed that Mania's <b>symbiote</b> is the cloned <b>symbiote</b> from Way's 2003 Venom series. The <b>symbiote</b> expelled the clone, and the demonic brand along with it, passing it to Mania. When a team led by Crossbones starts killing the brand bearers and taking the brands for themselves, Venom and Mania manage to fight them off with assistance from Mephisto. Mephisto then departs after telling Thompson that the deal he made in exchange for the brand was with the <b>symbiote,</b> not Thompson. The series ends with Thompson admitting that despite his issues with his father, he had {{always wanted to be a}} dad, and that he will now take responsibility for Mania.|$|E
5|$|Under the symbiote's influence, Peter exposes rival {{photographer}} Eddie Brock, whose fake photos depicted Spider-Man as a criminal. Soon afterward, to make Mary Jane jealous, Peter brings Gwen to {{the nightclub}} where Mary Jane now works, but Gwen catches on and leaves. Peter brawls with the bouncers and, after accidentally hurting Mary Jane, {{he realizes that}} the <b>symbiote</b> is corrupting him. Retreating to a church bell tower, he discovers that he cannot remove the suit, but that the <b>symbiote</b> weakens when the bell rings. Peter is able to remove the <b>symbiote,</b> and it falls to the lower tower, landing on Brock, who had been praying for Peter's death. The <b>symbiote</b> bonds to Brock, transforming him into Venom. Brock locates Marko and convinces him to join forces to defeat Peter. Brock hijacks a taxi with Mary Jane on board, and hangs it as bait from a web above a construction site, while Marko keeps the police at bay. Peter seeks Harry's help, but is rejected. While Peter battles Brock and Marko, Harry learns the truth about his father's death from his butler, and goes to help Peter as he is being overpowered, resulting in a battle between the four. Harry subdues the Sandman before assisting Peter against Brock. In the ensuing battle, Brock attempts to impale Peter on Harry's glider, but Harry intervenes and is impaled himself. Remembering the symbiote's weakness, Peter assembles a perimeter of metal pipes to create a sonic attack, weakening Venom, and allowing Peter to separate Brock and the <b>symbiote.</b> Peter activates a pumpkin bomb from Harry's glider to destroy the <b>symbiote,</b> but Brock dives in, and the bomb kills them both.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Symbiotes</b> (originally {{known as}} the Klyntar) are a fictional race of {{amorphous}} extraterrestrial <b>symbiotes</b> appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The <b>Symbiotes</b> bond with their hosts, creating a symbiotic bond through which creates a single entity.|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} {{dependent}} on immune lysis is described for {{the isolation of}} intracellular <b>symbiotes</b> from two species of flagellate protozoa Blastocrithidia culicis and Crithidia oncopeiti. The symbiote-containing flagellates are exposed to complement and antisera prepared in rabbits against symbiote-free organisms. The immune lysis seems to weaken the plasma membranes of the flagellates so that subsequent application of gentle shearing force liberates the intraceUular entities in an undamaged condition. The <b>symbiotes</b> are then separated from other cellular components by DNAse digestion and differential centrifugation. The average recovery of <b>symbiotes</b> isolated by this method is 20 %. Light and electron microscopy establishes the structural integrity and numerical abundance of isolated <b>symbiotes</b> in the final fractions. Integrity of <b>symbiotes</b> is further indicated by the high activity of a marker enzyme, uroporphyrinogen I synthetase. The DNA's of symbiote-containing and symbiote-free flagellates, and of isolated <b>symbiotes</b> were purified and compared after isopycnic centrifugation. Th...|$|R
50|$|The Xenophages, {{a race of}} {{extraterrestrial}} shapeshifters which prey on <b>symbiotes,</b> {{possess the}} ability to spew an unknown incendiary chemical that can paralyze <b>symbiotes,</b> and enhance their taste.|$|R
5|$|A four-part series {{published}} between January and April 1996, {{the story}} begins with the New York Police Department using Brock's wife, Ann, to trap him. Brock sends the <b>symbiote</b> to Ann, turning her into She-Venom again and letting her escape. In issue #3, Ann is afraid of the symbiote's influence and refuses {{to have anything to}} do with Brock while he wears it. This plotline is resolved in The Amazing Spider-Man Vol.2 #19 (2000), in which Ann's experience with the <b>symbiote</b> triggers her suicide. The story includes contemporary Spider-Man Ben Reilly trying to bring Venom to justice.|$|E
5|$|Columbia Pictures gave Spider-Man 3 a US {{release on}} May 4, 2007. The film begins with Peter Parker basking in his success as Spider-Man before an {{extraterrestrial}} <b>symbiote</b> takes control of him. Peter must then battle a rival photographer that the <b>symbiote</b> then takes control of (Topher Grace) and the Sandman (Thomas Haden Church). The general consensus among critics {{was that the}} final installment was not as refined as the first two entries, with it being criticized for its excessive use of villains, romantic conflicts and weak plot points. Nonetheless, Spider-Man 3 surpassed the previous two films' openings, making $151 million at over 4,250 locations.|$|E
5|$|Venom is {{the title}} of several American comic book series {{published}} by Marvel Comics focusing on the various heroic and villainous incarnations of the character Venom, which have usually consisting of a human host and amorphous alien being called a <b>symbiote.</b> The first incarnation of the character was the one created by the first human host to the <b>symbiote,</b> Eddie Brock, and—since 2011—its current host, Flash Thompson). Beginning with , eighteen limited series following Brock's adventures were published monthly between February 1993 and January 1998. A monthly Venom series began publication in 2003, following a new character, Patricia Robertson, and a clone of the original <b>symbiote.</b> The series concluded in 2004 after 18 issues. In 2011 another monthly series, following the adventures of Flash Thompson, was launched. The series concluded in October 2013 with its forty-second issue.|$|E
5000|$|After Carnage {{goes on a}} {{yet another}} murder spree, he ambushes the Mercury Team {{in their own home}} base and dismembers them, {{although}} the <b>symbiotes</b> survive. He does the same to Deadpool, who is hunting him. The hostless <b>symbiotes</b> revive Deadpool and turn him into the new Hybrid. After using the <b>symbiotes</b> to defeat Carnage and Shriek, Deadpool gives them to the dog owned by the Mercury Team, and instructs it to bring the <b>symbiotes</b> to [...] "the governmental bigwigs who know {{how to take care of}} 'em".|$|R
40|$|Mycetomes in Helochara communis are paired syncytia each {{enclosed}} by an epithelium. Adjacent are loose aggregates of mycetocytes. Mycetomes harboured 3 kinds of inclusions: companion, a- and J-symbiotes according to Buchner's classification of homopteran <b>symbiotes.</b> In the mycetocytes, a fourth kind of inclusion was found and named g-symbiotes. All inclusions were Feulgen and Gram negative. Nucleoids were revealed in companion <b>symbiotes</b> by osmium-HCl-Giemsa; and, in some g- and t-, {{but not in}} a-, <b>symbiotes</b> by RNase-papain-Giemsa. DNase digestion caused loss of basophilia in g- and t-, but not in a-, <b>symbiotes.</b> By electron microscopy, using Kellenberger's fixative, companion, g- and t- <b>symbiotes</b> had lucid areas with reticular strands 4 nm thick; a-symbiotes were in general, homogeneously densely granular. Companion <b>symbiotes</b> had Gram-negative profiles with additional surface material; a- and i-symbiotes had 3, g-symbiotes 2, peripheral, trilaminar membranes. Parallel striations and regularly arranged granules occurred in companion symbiotes; crystalline inclusions in g-and i-symbiotes; and fibrillar elements and dense bodies in a-symbiotes. Companion <b>symbiotes</b> may be Gram-negative bacteria or rickettsiae; g- and i-symbiotes, L-phase bacteria; but a-symbiotes are anomalous, apparently lacking DNA, and probably being derivatives of J-symbiotes, thus requiring that Muller's hypothesis of homopteran evolutionary pathways be rephrased...|$|R

5|$|During {{a festival}} honoring Spider-Man, Peter kisses Gwen Stacy, infuriating Mary Jane. The superpowered Marko robs an armored car, and Peter confronts him. Marko easily subdues Peter, and escapes. NYPD Captain George Stacy informs Peter and Aunt May that Marko was Uncle Ben's true killer; the {{deceased}} Dennis Carradine was Marko's accomplice. While a vengeance-obsessed Peter sleeps in his Spider-Man suit, the <b>symbiote</b> assimilates his suit. Peter later awakens and discovers his costume changed and his powers enhanced; however, the <b>symbiote</b> brings out Peter's dark side. Wearing the new suit, Peter locates Marko and battles {{him in a}} subway tunnel. Discovering that water is Marko's weakness, Peter breaks a water pipe, causing water to reduce Marko into mud, washing him away and believing him to be dead.|$|E

The story follows former reporter Eddie Brock, first introduced in The Amazing Spider-Man #300 (May 1988), as a villain and {{enemy of the}} superhero Spider-Man. In his appearances in The Amazing Spider-Man, Brock blames Spider-Man for ending his career by debunking one of his stories. He bonds with the Venom <b>symbiote,</b> a sentient alien that had previously bonded with (and been rejected by) Spider-Man. Together, Brock and the <b>symbiote</b> become Venom. In The Amazing Spider-Man #375, Brock makes peace with Spider-Man after he saves Brock's wife (Ann Weying) from death. Brock then moves {{back to his home}} city of San Francisco for a fresh start, starting the events of Venom: Lethal Protector.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} for Spider-Man 3 {{began on}} January 16, 2006 and wrapped in July 2006 after over 100 days of filming. The team filmed in Los Angeles until May 19, 2006. In spring 2006, film location manager Peter Martorano brought camera crews to Cleveland {{due to the}} Greater Cleveland Film Commission offering production space at the city's convention center at no cost. In Cleveland, they shot the battle between Spider-Man and Sandman in the armored car. Afterwards, the team moved to Manhattan, where filming took place at various locations, including One Chase Manhattan Plaza, from May 26, 2006 until July 1, 2006. Shooting placed a strain on Raimi, who often had to move between several units to complete the picture. Shooting was also difficult for cinematographer Bill Pope, as the <b>symbiote</b> Spider-Man, Venom, and the New Goblin were costumed in black during fight scenes taking place at night.|$|E
