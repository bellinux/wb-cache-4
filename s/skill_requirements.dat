25|$|Grandia {{features}} a rotational party roster. The statistics of each party member increase {{each time they}} gain a new level by defeating enemies and earning experience points. Characters learn new abilities through the repeated use of weapons and spells. Once a particular weapon/magic spell is used {{a number of times}} in battle, its Skill Level is raised. Weapons are divided into different classes, including swords, maces, axes, whips and knives. Each party member's potential abilities are listed on a Skill screen within the game's main menu, as well as the <b>Skill</b> <b>requirements</b> that must be met in order to learn them. The game encourages players to periodically switch between weapons. When a weapon or magic element levels up, permanent stat points are added to that character as well. For example, when a character's water skill levels up, they also receive +1 HP as well as +2 MP.|$|E

Some of the requirements to prove this situation include: proof of advertising for the specific position; <b>skill</b> <b>requirements</b> particular to the job; verification of the prevailing wage for a position; and the employer's ability to pay. This is currently done through an electronic system known as PERM. [...] The date when the labor certification application is filed becomes the applicant's priority date. In some cases, for highly skilled foreign nationals (EB1 and EB2 National Interest Waiver, e.g. researchers, athletes, artists or business executives) and [...] "Schedule A" [...] labor (nurses and physical therapists), this step is waived. This step is processed by the United States Department of Labor (DOL). [...] The labor certification is valid for 6 months from the time it is approved.|$|E

40|$|Senate Bill SB 1209 (Chap. 517, Stats. 2006) {{was signed}} by the Governor on September 28, 2006. One of the changes made by SB 1209 was to add five new options to meet the basic <b>skills</b> <b>requirement,</b> in {{addition}} to passage of the California Basic Educational Skills Test (CBEST). This correspondence is an update on three of the new options. Key Provisions: SB 1209 allows six options for meeting the basic <b>skills</b> <b>requirement.</b> However, three of the options will not be available at this time as passing scores have not been established by the Superintendent of Public Instruction. These three options are: � Passage of the ACT Plus Writing examination; � Passage of the GRE (Graduate Record) examination; and � Passage of the SAT Reasoning examination. The current options to meet the basic <b>skills</b> <b>requirement</b> are: � Passage of the CBEST; � Passage of a basic skills examination from another state; and � Passage of the revised CSET: Multiple Subjects examination (CSET: Multiple Subjects Plus Writing Skills) which includes an assessment of writing skills. Background: Since 1983, CBEST {{has been the only}} option for meeting the state <b>requirement</b> for basic <b>skills</b> proficiency. The current three options to meet the basic <b>skills</b> <b>requirement</b> may be used to satisfy the basic <b>skills</b> <b>requirement</b> for all types of documents requiring that basic skills be met.

In the past, the floor exercise event was executed on the bare floor or mats such as wrestling mats. The floor event now occurs on a carpeted 12m × 12m square, usually consisting of hard foam over a layer of plywood, which is supported by springs generally called a [...] "spring" [...] floor. This provides a firm surface that provides extra bounce or spring when compressed, allowing gymnasts to achieve greater height and a softer landing after the composed skill. Gymnasts perform a choreographed routine up to 90 seconds in the floor exercise event; Depending on the level, they may choose their own, or, if known as a [...] "," [...] default music must be played. Levels three to six the music {{is the same for}} each levels along with the skills within the routine. However, recently, the levels have switched. Now, levels 6-10 are optional levels and they get to have custom routines made. In the optional levels (levels six to ten) there are <b>skill</b> <b>requirements</b> for the routine but the athlete is able to pick her own music without any words. The routine should consist of tumbling passes, series of jumps, leaps, dance elements, acrobatic skills, and turns, or pivots, on one foot. A gymnast can perform up to four tumbling passes that usually includes at least one flight element without hand support. Each level of gymnastics requires the athlete to perform a different number of tumbling passes. In level 7 in the United States, a gymnast is required to do 2–3, and in levels 8–10, at least 3–4 tumbling passes are required.|$|E

To enable the developmental aspect of the BELLCURVE research project, a design science approach is used as the overall research methodology. An initial framework was developed based on a literature analysis incorporating three major elements namely skill capture (demand), education (supply) and HEI governance reform, having the concept of lifelong learning embedded in each element. Furthermore, when refining the framework, BELLCURVE is primarily concerned with four types of entities namely Educational; Industrial; Professional; and Learning, and focuses on two distinct concepts namely “Skill mismatches between requirements and supply” and “lifelong learning via through-life studentship”.
