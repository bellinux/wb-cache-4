Even {{though they are}} a sizable cricket for North America they are preyed upon by everything from hawks to hornets.|$|E
50|$|Digitaria ischaemum is {{a species}} of {{crabgrass}} known by the common names <b>smooth</b> <b>crabgrass</b> and small crabgrass. It is native to Europe and Asia, but it is known {{throughout much of the}} warm temperate world as an introduced species and often a common roadside and garden weed. It is an annual grass producing an inflorescence with two or more narrow branches lined with tiny spikelets.|$|E
5000|$|The {{prevalent}} {{species of}} Digitaria in North America are large crabgrass (D. sanguinalis), sometimes known as hairy crabgrass; and <b>smooth</b> <b>crabgrass</b> (D. ischaemum). These species often become problem weeds in lawns and gardens, growing especially well in thin lawns that are watered lightly, underfertilized, and poorly drained. They are annual plants, and one plant {{is capable of}} producing 150,000 seeds per season. The seeds germinate in the late {{spring and early summer}} and outcompete the domesticated lawn grasses, expanding outward in a circle up to 30 cm in diameter. In the autumn when the plants die, they leave large voids in the lawn. The voids then become prime areas for the crabgrass seeds to germinate the following season.|$|E
