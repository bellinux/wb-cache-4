Alfonso XIII of Spain had approached the British Foreign Office via his ambassador in London, and {{they agreed to}} allow Zita and her seven (soon to be eight) children to relocate to Spain.

Alfonso XIII offered his exiled Habsburg relatives the use of Palacio Uribarren at Lekeitio in the Bay of Biscay. This appealed to Zita, {{who did not want to}} be a heavy burden to the state that harboured her. For the next six years Zita settled in Lekeitio, where <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> with the job of raising and educating her children. They lived with straitened finances, mainly living on income from private property in Austria, income from a vineyard in Johannisberg, and voluntary collections. Other members of the exiled Habsburg dynasty, however, claimed much of this money, and there were regular petitions for help from former Imperial officials.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the UDA women {{having found}} Ogilby guilty, the two UDA men {{present at the}} [...] "trial" [...] couldn't reach a verdict and gave orders that she be released. The women drove her to the Glengall Street bus station where <b>she</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> a bus headed for the YWCA hostel she had moved to on the Malone Road. The women then [...] "rearrested" [...] her. It was alleged that this {{decision}} came about after she sarcastically remarked in reference to Douglas, [...] "Who does she think she is? The Queen?" [...] which had freshly infuriated Douglas and the others. Blocking the bus as it {{pulled out of the}} station into the street, Douglas and her [...] "Heavy Squad" [...] then boarded the bus and dragged her off into the waiting car for a further grilling. Minutes later, after being alerted by the bus station staff, the car was stopped by the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). Although Douglas claimed {{they were on their way}} to a party, the querying policeman told the women about the report of one of them having been forced off the bus. In an attempt to mollify Douglas, Ogilby then spoke up admitting that she was the person who had been removed from the bus but that [...] "It was nothing. Just a couple of us fooling around". The police however remained unconvinced of their claims and the eight women and Ogilby were taken into the RUC Queen Street station for questioning. All of the women were asked for their names and addresses; the majority lived in the Sandy Row area. [...] Fearing the grisly fate that typically befell informers, Ogilby did not say anything to the RUC about the UDA kangaroo court or threats against her. Therefore, she and the eight other women were released without being charged the following morning at 2.00 a.m. Ogilby returned to the police station a few hours later, visibly frightened, but was sent home in a taxi after refusing to give the reason for her distress. That same day inside a Sandy Row pub, Douglas told the other women that Ogilby was a troublemaker who had to die, and she speedily made arrangements to facilitate the murder.|$|E
