40|$|The {{past decade}} has seen a {{significant}} amount of academic and industrial research into interconnect topologies that employ optical channels for next generation high speed communication systems. Integrated optical interconnects have taken center stage in tackling channel loss limitations of traditional electrical links and bandwidth requirements for inter-chip and intra-chip signal processing for multi-core processors. Wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) optical interconnect architectures based on microring resonator devices offer a low-area and energy-efficient approach to realize both high-speed modulation and WDM with high-speed transmit-side ring modulators and high-Q receive-side drop filters. At the heart of silicon photonics is the silicon microring resonator. These high-Q refractive devices can achieve high contrast ratios with their small footprint and enable distance independent communication. A major challenge to the use of microring resonators is the sensitivity of their resonance wavelength to process and fabrication imperfections and temperature perturbations. To curtail the effects of resonance wavelength drifts, stabilization schemes are implemented to properly align the resonance wavelength of the microring device with the input laser wavelength. This thesis work focuses on three main issues. Firstly, the sources and effects of mismatch in silicon microring resonators are identified. Secondly, a review of literature is done to examine existing resonance wavelength stabilization techniques. Based on the reference search tuning algorithm, a new dual-loop tuning method which combines the benefits of bias-based and thermal-based tuning schemes is proposed. Furthermore, we evaluate the tuning efficiency of some existing and the proposed tuning schemes using a statistical model to determine optimal power and speed efficiency. Modeling results of carrier injection ring resonator devices with common thermal tuning and the new dual-bias/thermal scheme reveals that the latter scheme offers ~ 50 % improvement in power with small variations and close to 16 X speed improvement. Finally, the tuning control loop is fabricated in GP 65 nm CMOS process. Transmit-side and receive-side are independently implemented for a 5 -channel WDM system. Measurement results are presented in both cases. The transmitter IC achieved both static and dynamic tuning, <b>stabilizing</b> <b>ring</b> resonance wavelength in the midst of temperature fluctuations from an adjacent ring.

40|$|ZipA and FtsA are {{recruited}} independently to the FtsZ cytokinetic ring (Z ring) and {{are essential}} for cell division of Escherichia coli. The molecular role of FtsA in cell division is unknown; however, ZipA is thought to <b>stabilize</b> the Z <b>ring,</b> anchor it to the membrane, and recruit downstream cell division proteins. Here we demonstrate that the requirement for ZipA can be bypassed completely by a single alteration in a conserved residue of FtsA (FtsA*). Cells with ftsA* in single copy in place of WT ftsA or with ftsA* alone on a multicopy plasmid divide mostly normally, whether they are zipA+ or zipA−. Experiments with ftsQAZ and ftsQA*Z on multicopy plasmids indicate that ftsQAZ/zipA+ and ftsQA*Z/zipA− cells divide fairly normally, whereas ftsQAZ/zipA− cells divide poorly and ftsQA*Z/zipA+ cells display a phenotype that suggests their septa are unusually stable. In support {{of the idea that}} ftsA* <b>stabilizes</b> Z <b>rings,</b> single-copy ftsA* confers resistance to excess MinC, which destabilizes Z rings. The inhibitory effect of excess ZipA on division is also suppressed by ftsA*.

40|$|In the cyanobacterial {{circadian}} oscillator, KaiA and KaiB alternately stimulate autophosphorylation and autodephosphorylation of KaiC with a periodicity {{of approximately}} 24  h. KaiA activates autophosphorylation by selectively capturing the A loops of KaiC in their exposed positions. The A loops and sites of phosphorylation, residues S 431 and T 432, {{are located in}} the CII ring of KaiC. We find that the flexibility of the CII ring governs the rhythm of KaiC autophosphorylation and autodephosphorylation and is an example of dynamics-driven protein allostery. KaiA-induced autophosphorylation requires flexibility of the CII ring. In contrast, rigidity is required for KaiC-KaiB binding, which induces a conformational change in KaiB that enables it to sequester KaiA by binding to KaiA’s linker. Autophosphorylation of the S 431 residues around the CII <b>ring</b> <b>stabilizes</b> the CII <b>ring,</b> making it rigid. In contrast, autophosphorylation of the T 432 residues offsets phospho-S 431 -induced rigidity to some extent. In the presence of KaiA and KaiB, the dynamic states of the CII ring of KaiC executes the following circadian rhythm:. Apparently, these dynamic states govern the pattern of phosphorylation, ST → SpT → pSpT → pST → ST. CII-CI ring-on-ring stacking is observed when the CII ring is rigid, suggesting a mechanism through which the ATPase activity of the CI ring is rhythmically controlled.

In certain situations [...] especially when associated with abdominal trauma {{and the need to}} perform laparotomies [...] both techniques may put the patient at risk of either pintract or deep plate infections. We describe an operative approach to percutaneously close and <b>stabilize</b> the pelvic <b>ring</b> using spinal implants as an internal fixator and report the results in a small series of patients treated with this technique during the resuscitation phase.

Non-covalent Ub binding to {{the backside of}} certain E 2 s promotes processive polyUb formation, but the mechanism remains elusive. Here, we show that backside bound Ub (UbB) enhances both RING-independent and RING-dependent UbcH 5 B-catalyzed donor Ub (UbD) transfer, but with a more prominent effect in RING-dependent transfer. UbB enhances RING E 3 s’ affinities for UbcH 5 B–Ub, and RING E 3 -UbcH 5 B–Ub complex improves UbB’s affinity for UbcH 5 B. A comparison of the crystal structures of a RING E 3, RNF 38, bound to UbcH 5 B–Ub in the absence and presence of UbB, together with molecular dynamics simulation and biochemical analyses, suggests UbB restricts the flexibility of UbcH 5 B’s α 1 and α 1 β 1 loop.

To promote the formation of small clusters, a BMW injector valve is modified to permit its use as a pulsed nozzle at very cold temperatures. This results in a substantial enhancement in the concentration of small aggregates and permits an analysis of relative spectral intensities {{as a function of}} initial temperature, pressure and composition. CARS probing of CO₂ in jets reveals several new peaks in the region of the Fermi doublet, v₁ and 2 v₂, which appear only in the cold, highly condensing conditions of the expansion. This study focuses upon several peaks which are red shifted from the 1285. 5 cm⁻¹, vi monomer peak. The dependence of the relative peak intensities upon initial temperature and CO₂ concentration along with the relative shift from the monomer has enabled assignment of peaks at 1281. 3 cm⁻¹, 1278. 7 cm⁻¹ and 1275. 3 cm⁻¹ to the dimer, trimer and higher polymers respectively. The dimer structure {{has been the subject of}} much controversy and the present results are enlightening in this regard. The CARS dimer peak is shifted - 4. 1 cm⁻¹ from the monomer resonance and comparison with a published infrared spectrum, showing a dimer band with a - 0. 7 cm⁻¹ shift, shows that the dimer adheres to the rule of mutual exclusion and must therefore, have a structure with a center of symmetry. Earlier experimental and theoretical studies gave conflicting evidence for one of two structures, a T-shaped configuration with C 2 v symmetry and an offset parallel structure with C₂h symmetry. Since only the C₂h form has a center of symmetry, it is concluded that the most stable arrangement for the dimer of CO₂ is the nonpolar, offset parallel structure.
