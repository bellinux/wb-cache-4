An approach is described for developing reusable parts for the applications of missile guidance, navigation and control which meet the following criteria: (1) Reusable; (2) Tailorable; (3) Efficient; (4) Simple to use; and (5) Protected against misuse.

40|$|Variants of {{general-purpose}} programming languages, like SystemC, {{are increasingly}} used to specify system designs that have both hardware and <b>software</b> <b>parts.</b> The system-level languages allow a flexible partitioning {{in the design}} of the hardware and software. Moreover, many properties depend on the combination of hardware and software and cannot be verified on either part alone. Existing tools either apply non-formal approaches or handle only the low-level parts of the language. This papers presents a new technique that handles both hardware and <b>software</b> <b>parts</b> of a system description. This is done by automatically partitioning the uniform system description into synchronous (hardware) and asynchronous (<b>software)</b> <b>parts.</b> This technique has been implemented and applied to system level descriptions of several industrial examples. The hardware/software partitioning improves the performance of the verification compared to the monolithic approach. ...|$|R

40|$|Software {{development}} is a serious bottleneck {{in the construction of}} complex automated systems. An increase of the reuse of software designs and components has been viewed as a way to relieve this bottleneck. One approach to achieving software reusability is through the development and use of <b>software</b> <b>parts</b> composition systems. A <b>software</b> <b>parts</b> composition system is a software development environment comprised of a parts description language for modeling parts and their interfaces, a catalog of existing parts, a composition editor that aids a user in the specification of a new application from existing parts, and a code generator that takes a specification and generates an implementation of a new application in a target language. The Automated Software Development Workstation (ASDW) is an expert system shell that provides the capabilities required to develop and manipulate these <b>software</b> <b>parts</b> composition systems. The ASDW is now in Beta testing at the Johnson Space Center. Future work centers on responding to user feedback for capability and usability enhancement, expanding the scope of the software lifecycle that is covered, and in providing solutions to handling very large libraries of reusable components...|$|R

50|$|In {{hardware}} software co-design, {{the designer}} specifies {{the structure and}} behavior of the system using finite state machines which communicate among themselves. Then a series of testing, simulation and formal verification are done on these state machines before deciding which components go into the hardware and which of these into the software. The hardware is usually done in field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) or application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), whereas the <b>software</b> <b>part</b> is translated into low-level programming language.

40|$|Abstract: The idea of {{building}} a device out of separate parts is gaining more common practice in the <b>software</b> industry. <b>Software</b> <b>parts</b> are designed {{with the potential for}} reuse. The reuse of the <b>software</b> <b>parts</b> promises to reduce development cost and time. This process triggers some new usability issues, especially when the user interface (UI) is also designed as a complex of several parts. A study is carried out to find out whether and how the usability of a UI part can be tested, and thirdly how the usability of an individual UI part can be affected by other UI parts. Analysis of log files that captured the basic user-system interaction components seems a promising evaluation method. Preliminary experimental results show that this evaluation method is more sensitive than traditional method as number of keystrokes or task time analysis...|$|R

The component graphs serve {{as a basis for}} further software product line work. In this paper, we concentrate on the analysis part of the method and the graph clustering. We apply the graph clustering method to a real application in the context of automation / robot configuration software tools. Comment: In Proceedings FMSPLE 2015, arXiv: 1504. 0301...|$|R
