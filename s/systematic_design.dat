25|$|Instructional design, the <b>systematic</b> <b>design</b> of materials, {{activities}} and interactive environments for learning, is broadly informed by educational psychology theories and research. For example, in defining learning goals or objectives, instructional designers often use a taxonomy of educational objectives created by Benjamin Bloom and colleagues. Bloom also researched mastery learning, an instructional strategy in which learners only advance {{to a new}} learning objective after they have mastered its prerequisite objectives. Bloom discovered {{that a combination of}} mastery learning with one-to-one tutoring is highly effective, producing learning outcomes far exceeding those normally achieved in classroom instruction. Gagné, another psychologist, had earlier developed an influential method of task analysis in which a terminal learning goal is expanded into a hierarchy of learning objectives connected by prerequisite relationships.|$|E
2500|$|Domestic (or residential) kitchen {{design is}} a {{relatively}} recent discipline. The first ideas to optimize {{the work in the}} kitchen go back to Catharine Beecher's A Treatise on Domestic Economy (1843, revised and republished together with her sister Harriet Beecher Stowe as The American Woman's Home in 1869). Beecher's [...] "model kitchen" [...] propagated {{for the first time a}} <b>systematic</b> <b>design</b> based on early ergonomics. The design included regular shelves on the walls, ample work space, and dedicated storage areas for various food items. Beecher even separated the functions of preparing food and cooking it altogether by moving the stove into a compartment adjacent to the kitchen.|$|E
2500|$|Diocletian's avowed {{conservatism}} {{almost certainly}} precludes a <b>systematic</b> <b>design</b> toward personal elevation as a [...] "divine monarch". Rather, he formally elaborated imperial ceremony as {{a manifestation of}} the divine order of empire and elevated emperorship as the supreme instrument of the divine will. The idea was [...] Augustan, or earlier, expressed most clearly in Stoic philosophy and the solar cult, especially under Aurelian. At the very beginning of his reign, before his Tetrarchy, Diocletian had adopted the [...] of Jovius; his co-Augustus adopted the title Herculius. During the Tetrarchy, the titles were multiplied, but with no clear reflection of implicit divine seniority: in one case, the divine signum of the Augustus is inferior to that of his Caesar. These divine associations may have followed a military precedent of emperors as comes to divinities (or divinities as comes to emperors). Moreover, the divine signum appears in the fairly narrow context of court panegyric and civil etiquette. It makes no appearance on the general coinage of the Tetrarchy: coin images and group statuary of the Tetrarchs themselves show each as an impersonal, near-homogenous abstraction of imperial might and unity.|$|E

40|$|Biologically-Inspired Design is a {{specific}} type of between domain Design-by-Analogy (DbA) where inspiration is taken from the natural world to solve technical problems or challenges. Although Biologically-Inspired Design has been around for centuries (e. g. the flying machines of Leonardo da Vinci), nowadays, there is an increased interest for nature as a source of design inspiration. Three main motivations are often associated with Biologically-Inspired Design: (1) the proven performance of nature's solutions holds potential for avoiding a lengthy learning curve for solving technical problems, (2) bio-inspired design is frequently associated with identifying out-of-the-box solutions which is an appealing characteristic in an industrial context where continuous innovation is an important competitive weapon and (3) the potential for sustainable bio-inspired products addresses a general increase in environmental consciousness. Because the individuals tasked with developing novel concepts typically lack extensive biological knowledge, Biologically-Inspired Design requires overcoming a knowledge gap between the biological and technological domain. As there were (and are) no widespread tools or methodologies for bio-ideation in industry, it is generally assumed that spontaneous or accidental inspiration {{played an important role in}} triggering bio-inspired concepts. However, in an industrial context, a more pro-active approach is advisable. Therefore, in the last two decades, a new research domain emerged that aims at developing tools and methodologies to support <b>Systematic</b> Biologically-Inspired <b>Design.</b> At the onset of this doctoral study, a literature study exposed that the state-of-the-art in <b>Systematic</b> Biologically-Inspired <b>Design</b> struggles with scalability, meaning that only a fraction of human's knowledge about nature could be leveraged. The need for interactive work for each biological strategy during database expansion was the main cause. The identification of this common bottleneck led to the formulation of the first research goal, introducing scalability into the search phase of the <b>Systematic</b> Biologically-Inspired <b>Design</b> process. To meet this goal, this dissertation presents two approaches for Scalable <b>Systematic</b> Biologically-Inspired <b>Design.</b> First, an algorithm is proposed to scale one of the existing approaches for <b>Systematic</b> Biologically-Inspired <b>Design</b> (AskNature) by eliminating interactive classification into AskNature's Biomimicry Taxonomy. Second, a new scalable approach is proposed - named Scalable sEarch for <b>systemAtic</b> Biologically-InspiRed <b>Design</b> (SEABIRD) - that leverages both a patent and biological paper database to link products and patents (problems) to organisms and biological strategies (solutions). In order to meet the first research goal, a number of components, called supporting algorithms, are required that have applications which are not limited to the envisaged contributions. Hence, the second research goal is formulated as the development and dissemination of algorithms that enable the creation of tools to support Scalable <b>Systematic</b> Biologically-Inspired <b>Design.</b> The developed supporting algorithms are: webcrawling for biological strategy documents, mention and focus organism detection in biological strategy documents and multi-word product identification in patents. The value of these three supporting algorithms is demonstrated by their uptake in the two proposed approaches for Scalable <b>Systematic</b> Biologically-Inspired <b>Design.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

Usually the new lines are unreplicated at a site. The efficiency of different types of <b>systematic</b> unreplicated EGVT <b>designs</b> compared to optimal or efficient designs is investigated. Two design optimality criteria are used, and are compared for their association with the probability of selecting the highest yielding varieties.
