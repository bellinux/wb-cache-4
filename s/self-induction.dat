500|$|In 1807, Robert Fulton {{initiated}} a steamboat line from New York to Albany, {{the first successful}} enterprise of its kind. By 1810, with 10,763 people, Albany was the 10th-largest urban place in the nation. The town and village were known as [...] "the Colonie" [...] {{to the north of}} Albany was annexed in 1815. In 1825 the Erie Canal was completed, forming a continuous water route from the Great Lakes to New York City. Unlike the current Barge Canal, which ends at nearby Waterford, the original Erie Canal ended at Albany; Lock 1 was north of Colonie Street. The Canal emptied into a [...] man-made lagoon called the Albany Basin, which was Albany's main port from 1825 until the Port of Albany-Rensselaer opened in 1932. In 1829, while working as a professor at the Albany Academy, Joseph Henry, widely regarded as [...] "the foremost American scientist of the 19th century", built the first electric motor. Three years later, he discovered electromagnetic <b>self-induction</b> (the SI unit for which is now the henry). He went on to be the first Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. In the 1830 and 1840 censuses, Albany was ranked as the 9th-largest urban place in the nation, then back to 10th in 1850.

50|$|The {{discovery}} of electromagnetic induction was made almost simultaneously, although independently, by Michael Faraday, who {{was first to}} make the discovery in 1831, and Joseph Henry in 1832.

5000|$|The word dynamo (from the Greek word dynamis(δύναμις), meaning {{force or}} power) was {{originally}} {{another name for}} an electrical generator, and still has some regional usage {{as a replacement for}} the word generator. The word [...] "dynamo" [...] was coined by Werner von Siemens in 1882. The original [...] "dynamo principle" [...] of W. Siemens meant only the direct current generators which use exclusively the self-excitation (<b>self-induction)</b> principle to generate DC power. The earlier DC generators which used permanent magnets were not considered [...] "dynamo electric machines". The invention of the Dynamo principle (<b>self-induction)</b> was a huge technological leap over the old traditional permanent magnet based DC generators. The discovery of the dynamo principle made industrial scale electric power generation technically and economically feasible.After the invention of the alternator and that alternating current {{can be used as a}} power supply, the word dynamo became associated exclusively with the commutated direct current electric generator, while an AC electrical generator using either slip rings or rotor magnets would become known as an alternator.|$|E

5000|$|The thermo-galvanometer is an {{instrument}} for measuring small electric currents. It was invented by William Duddell about 1900. The following is {{a description of the}} instrument taken from a trade catalog of Cambridge Scientific Instrument Company dated 1905: For a long time the need of {{an instrument}} capable of accurately measuring small alternating currents has been keenly felt. The high resistance and <b>self-induction</b> of the coils of instruments of the electro-magnetic type frequently prevent their use. Electro-static instruments as at present constructed are not altogether suitable for measuring very small currents, unless a sufficient potential difference is available.The thermo-galvanometer designed by Mr W. Duddell can be used for the measurement of extremely small currents to a high degree of accuracy. It has practically no <b>self-induction</b> or capacity and can therefore be used on a circuit of any frequency (even up to 120,000~ per sec.) and currents as small as twenty micro-amperes can be readily measured by it [...] It is equally correct on continuous and alternating currents. It can therefore be accurately standardized by continuous current and used without error on circuits of any frequency or wave-form.The principle of the thermo-galvanometer is simple. The instrument consists of a resistance which is heated by the current to be measured, the heat from the resistance falling on the thermo-junction of a Boys radio-micrometer. The rise in temperature of the lower junction of the thermo-couple produces a current in the loop which is deflected by the magnetic field against the torsion of the quartz fibre.|$|E
50|$|A simpler device, the {{low tension}} coil, {{was already in}} use for {{stationary}} engines and spark-ignition gas engines. This was a simple iron-core inductor, used with a battery and a switch called a contact breaker. It had a single winding and so was not a transformer like the trembler coil. When the piston was at the right point, the contact breaker opened, breaking the battery current. <b>Self-induction</b> due to the collapsing magnetic field generated a high voltage pulse in the coil, which {{was applied to the}} spark plug. The drawback of the low tension coil was that the high ignition voltage was generated in the same circuit as the low voltage battery current flowed in.|$|E
50|$|It {{works because}} the loading coils used on {{balanced}} lines have two windings, {{one for each}} leg of the circuit. They are both wound on a common core and the windings are so arranged that the magnetic flux induced by both of them {{is in the same}} direction. Both windings induce an emf in each other as well as their own <b>self-induction.</b> This effect greatly increases the inductance of the coil and hence its loading effectiveness. By contrast, when the circuit is in the phantom configuration the currents in the two wires of each pair are in the same direction and the magnetic flux is being cancelled. This has precisely the opposite effect and the inductance is greatly reduced.|$|E

The purpose of this review is to explore the effect of <b>self-induction</b> of Rifampicin. The results of this review showed that Rifampicin was metabolized by the CYP 3 A 4 enzyme.

40|$|A novel {{technically}} compliant {{expression system}} {{was developed for}} heterologous protein production in Bacillus subtilis {{with the aim of}} increasing product yields {{at the same time as}} decreasing production costs. Standard systems involve the positively regulated manP promoter of the mannose operon, which led to relatively high product yields of 5. 3 % (5. 3 g enhanced green fluorescent protein [eGFP] per 100 g cell dry weight [CDW]) but required large quantities of mannose to induce the reactions, thus rendering the system's technical application rather expensive. To improve this situation, mutant B. subtilis strains were used: the ΔmanA (mannose metabolism) strain TQ 281 and the ΔmanP (mannose uptake) strain TQ 356. The total amount of inducer could be reduced with TQ 281, which, however, displayed sensitivity to mannose. An inducer-independent <b>self-induction</b> system was developed with TQ 356 to further improve the cost efficiency and product yield of the system, in which glucose prevents induction by carbon catabolite repression. To create optimal <b>self-induction</b> conditions, a glucose-limited process strategy, namely, a fed-batch process, was utilized as follows. The initiation of <b>self-induction</b> at the beginning of the glucose-restricted transition phase between the batch and fed-batch phase of fermentation and its maintenance throughout the glucose-limiting fed-batch phase led to a nearly 3 -fold increase of product yield, to 14. 6 %. The novel B. subtilis <b>self-induction</b> system thus makes a considerable contribution to improving product yield and reducing the costs associated with its technical application...|$|E
40|$|Like MTL-heterozygous (a/α) cells, white MTL-homozygous (a/a or α/α) {{cells of}} Candida albicans, {{to which a}} {{minority}} of opaque cells of opposite mating type have been added, form thick, robust biofilms. The latter biofilms are uniquely stimulated by the pheromone released by opaque cells and are regulated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathway. However, white MTL-homozygous cells, to which opaque cells of opposite mating type have not been added, form thinner biofilms. Mutant analyses reveal that these latter biofilms are self-induced. <b>Self-induction</b> of a/a biofilms requires expression of the α-receptor gene STE 2 and the α-pheromone gene MFα, and <b>self-induction</b> of α/α biofilms requires expression of the a-receptor gene STE 3 and the a-pheromone gene MFa. In both cases, deletion of WOR 1, the master switch gene, blocks cells in the white phenotype and biofilm formation, indicating that <b>self-induction</b> depends upon low frequency switching from the white to opaque phenotype. These results suggest a <b>self-induction</b> scenario in which minority opaque a/a cells formed by switching secrete, in a mating-type-nonspecific fashion, α-pheromone, which stimulates biofilm formation through activation of the α-pheromone receptor of majority white a/a cells. A similar scenario is suggested for a white α/α cell population, in which minority opaque α/α cells secrete a-pheromone. This represents a paracrine system in which one cell type (opaque) signals a second highly related cell type (white) to undergo a complex response, {{in this case the}} formation of a unisexual white cell biofilm...|$|E
40|$|In {{secondary}} hyperparathyroidism, enhanced {{expression of}} TGF-α in the parathyroid leads {{to its own}} upregulation, generating a feed-forward loop for TGF-α activation of its receptor, EGFR receptor (EGFR), which promotes parathyroid hyperplasia. These studies examined the role of activator protein 2 α (AP 2), an inducer of TGF-α gene transcription, in the upregulation of parathyroid TGF-α in secondary hyperparathyroidism. In rat and human secondary hyperparathyroidism, parathyroid AP 2 expression strongly correlated with TGF-α levels and with the rate of parathyroid growth, as expected. Furthermore, the increases in rat parathyroid content of AP 2 and its binding to a consensus AP 2 DNA sequence preceded the increase in TGF-α induced by high dietary phosphate. More significant, in A 431 cells, which provide a model of enhanced TGF-α and TGF-α <b>self-induction,</b> mutating the core AP 2 site of the human TGF-α promoter markedly impaired promoter activity induced by endogenous or exogenous TGF-α. Important for therapy, in five-sixths nephrectomized rats fed high-phosphate diets, inhibition of parathyroid TGF-α <b>self-induction</b> using erlotinib, a highly specific inhibitor of TGF-α/EGFR-driven signals, reduced AP 2 expression dosage dependently. This suggests that the increases in parathyroid AP 2 occur downstream of EGFR activation by TGF-α and are required for TGF-α <b>self-induction.</b> Indeed, in A 431 cells, erlotinib inhibition of TGF-α <b>self-induction</b> caused parallel reductions in AP 2 expression and nuclear localization, as well as TGF-α mRNA and protein levels. In summary, increased AP 2 expression and transcriptional activity at the TGF-α promoter determine {{the severity of the}} hyperplasia driven by parathyroid TGF-α self-upregulation in secondary hyperparathyroidism...|$|E

Evolution of a finite-thickness vortex sheet under <b>self-induction</b> is also investigated using the Navier-Stokes equations. The layer evolves into a hairpin vortex which in turn produces a vortex ring of high Reynolds stress content.
