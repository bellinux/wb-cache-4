50|$|Whenever {{a player}} engages in battle, the game changes from the {{adventure}} map display to a combat screen, {{which is based}} on either a hexagonal or square grid. In this mode, the game mimics the turn-based tactics genre, as the engaged armies must carry through the battle without the opportunity to reinforce or gracefully retreat. With few exceptions, combat must end with the losing army deserting, being destroyed, or paying a heavy price in gold to <b>surrender.</b> <b>Surrendering</b> allows the player to keep the remaining units intact.|$|R

50|$|When enemy troops {{encounter}} each other, they cannot {{fire and}} must engage in melee. Each side rolls a six-sided die, multiplies the result {{by the number}} of units in action, and then adds modifiers to account for the quality and morale of the troops. The ratio of the higher and the lower number is then computed, and this ratio determines whether the side with the lower number stands fast, retires, is routed, or <b>surrenders.</b> <b>Surrendering</b> is the best result {{from the point of view}} of the victor, and occurs when the ratio is 2.5 to 1 or higher.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores how <b>surrender</b> {{has been}} written about in psychoanalytic psychotherapy. A thematic analysis of text was carried out, which in this case was of literature, and once a dataset was established through a process of literature review, the articles were subsequently coded and an initial model of <b>surrender</b> was produced. The subsequent thematic analysis revealed themes that collectively described the nature of the phenomenon and which were represented diagrammatically in a revised model of <b>surrender.</b> <b>Surrender</b> is concluded to be a transformative process that occurs within a tension of Trust and Need. Numerous suggestions are offered for future research as well as a critique of the method of study...|$|R

We must change, not because we want to, but because we desperately have to. We can not take life in its current suffocating state, even to admit such desperation shows that we are feeling deserted, wandering the barren desert, a shell of our former selves. It is only up from here, it is impossible to sink any lower into ourselves or our circumstances. But we can be salvaged, a deliverance. No vice can stand, no fix can take. The thorn in the side can be removed, {{but you have to be}} willing to admit and <b>surrender.</b> <b>Surrender</b> your habits, your lifestyle, your past, your present, and your future. This is your new <b>surrender.</b> The new <b>surrender.</b> New Surrender." [...] —Stephen Christian, Anberlin lyricist and vocalist, on the title New <b>Surrender</b> ...|$|R

5000|$|Some historians see ancient Japanese warrior traditions as a {{major factor}} in the {{resistance}} in the Japanese military to the idea of <b>surrender.</b> According to one Air Force account, The Japanese code of bushido—'the way of the warrior'—was deeply ingrained. The concept of Yamato-damashii equipped each soldier with a strict code: never be captured, never break down, and never <b>surrender.</b> <b>Surrender</b> was dishonorable. Each soldier was trained to fight to the death and was expected to die before suffering dishonor. Defeated Japanese leaders preferred to take their own lives in the painful samurai ritual of seppuku (called hara kiri in the West). Warriors who <b>surrendered</b> were not deemed worthy of regard or respect.|$|R

60|$|Hasdrubal's determination, however, {{to resist}} the Romans to the last, soon after this gave way, and he {{determined}} to <b>surrender.</b> He is accused of the most atrocious treachery in attempting thus to save himself, after excluding {{his wife and children}} from all possibility of escaping destruction. But the confusion and din of such a scene, the suddenness and violence with which the events succeed each other, and the tumultuous and uncontrollable mental agitation to which they give rise, deprive a man who is called to act in it of all sense and reason, and exonerate him, almost as much, from moral responsibility for what he does, as if he were insane. At any rate, Hasdrubal, after shutting up his wife and children with a furious gang of desperadoes who could not possibly <b>surrender,</b> <b>surrendered</b> himself, perhaps hoping that he might save them after all.|$|R
