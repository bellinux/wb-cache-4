50|$|In {{deep hole}} machining, a roller {{burnishing}} tool is often combined with <b>skiving</b> knives {{on the same}} tool. The <b>skiving</b> knives pass first, scraping the inside layer of metal, followed by the burnishing rollers, which cold work the tube to create a mirror surface finish. Skive-burnishing is often used in hydraulic cylinder applications. This process can happen on a deep hole drilling machine or a dedicated <b>skiving</b> machine.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>skiving</b> process, meaning [...] "to slice", can {{be applied}} to a variety of {{applications}} and materials. In leather, <b>skiving</b> knives trim the thickness of the leather, often around the edges, to thin the material and make it easier to work with. In metal working, <b>skiving</b> can be used to remove a thin dimension of material or to create thin slices in an existing material, such as heat sinks where a large amount of surface area is required relative to the volume of the piece of metal.|$|E

50|$|Another metal <b>skiving</b> {{application}} is for hydraulic cylinders, where a round and smooth cylinder inside {{is required for}} proper actuation. Several <b>skiving</b> knives on a round tool pass through a bore to create a perfectly round hole. Often, a second operation of roller burnishing follows to cold-work the surface for mirror-finish. This process is common among manufacturers of hydraulic and pneumatic cylinders.|$|E

50|$|<b>Skiving</b> is {{also used}} for the {{manufacturing}} of heat sinks for PC cooling products. A PC cooler created {{with the use of}} <b>skiving</b> has the benefit that the heat sink base and the heat sink fins are created from one piece of material (copper or aluminum). This provides optimal dissipation and transfer of the heat from the base to the fins. Additionally, the <b>skiving</b> process also increases the roughness of the heat-sink's fins. Unlike the underside of a heat-sink which needs to be smooth for maximum surface area contact with the heat-source that it cools, the fins benefit from this roughness because it increases the fins' surface area which serves to provide more area on which to release heat into the ambient environment.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Foot orthoses {{are often}} used to treat lower limb {{injuries}} associated with excessive pronation. There are many orthotic modifications available for this purpose, with one being the medial heel <b>skive.</b> However, empirical evidence for the mechanical effects of the medial heel <b>skive</b> modification is limited. This study aimed to evaluate the effect that different depths of medial heel <b>skive</b> have on plantar pressures. Methods Thirty healthy adults (mean age 24 years, range 18 – 46) with a flat-arched or pronated foot posture and no current foot pain or deformity participated in this study. Using the in-shoe pedar-X® system, plantar pressure data were collected for the rearfoot, midfoot and forefoot while participants walked along an 8 metre walkway wearing a standardised shoe. Experimental conditions included a customised foot orthosis with the following 4 orthotic modifications: (i) no medial heel <b>skive,</b> (ii) a 2 mm medial heel <b>skive,</b> (iii) a 4 mm medial heel <b>skive</b> and (iv) a 6 mm medial heel <b>skive.</b> Results Compared to the foot orthosis with no medial heel <b>skive,</b> statistically significant increases in peak pressure were observed at the medial rearfoot – there was a 15 % increase (p[*]=[*] 0. 001) with the 4 mm <b>skive</b> and a 29 % increase (p[*] Conclusions This study found that a medial heel <b>skive</b> of 4 mm or 6 mm increases peak pressure under the medial rearfoot in asymptomatic adults with a flat-arched or pronated foot posture. Plantar pressures at the midfoot and forefoot were not altered by a medial heel <b>skive</b> of 2, 4 or 6 mm. These findings provide some evidence {{for the effects of}} the medial heel <b>skive</b> orthotic modification. </p...|$|R
