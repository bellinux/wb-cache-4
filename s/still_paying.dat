As late as 1798 the parish was <b>still</b> <b>paying</b> its traditional castle-guard rent to Dover Castle and retained a court baron; this fee was a substitute for a feudal obligation requiring the provision of knights to defend the castle.|$|E
5|$|Nichols and Cooper {{came to an}} {{agreement}} about the Solway Bridge. Although it was in Knox County, Anderson County had contributed $27,000 towards its construction. It was <b>still</b> <b>paying</b> off the bonds, but now the bridge was usable only by CEW workers. Nichols negotiated a deal in which Knox County was paid $25,000 annually for the bridge, of which $6,000 was {{to be used to}} maintain the access road. Judge Thomas L. Seeber then threatened to close the Edgemoor Bridge unless Anderson County was similarly compensated. An agreement was reached under which Anderson County received $10,000 for the bridge and $200 per month. Knox County did not keep its side of the bargain to maintain the road, which was damaged by heavy traffic and became impassable after torrential rains in 1944. The Army was forced to spend $5,000 per month on road works in Knox County.|$|E
5|$|In 1929 {{the company}} asked HM Treasury for an {{extension}} of the period in which government loans to the company could be paid. The Treasury first demanded an audit of the company accounts, and sent Sir William McClintock to write a report on the financial state of the company. McClintock's report revealed that the company had not earned any trading profits since 1925, but was <b>still</b> <b>paying</b> dividends by taking money from the reserves. The company had reported £439,000 profits for 1926, but had drawn £750,000 out of the reserves and falsified accounts to make it appear that the money came from trading. In 1927 the company made a trading loss of £507,000, but money was again drawn from the reserves to make it appear that the company had made a profit of £478,000. As a result of this, and a report that in 1928 the company had issued a fraudulent prospectus inviting customers to buy shares in the company and saying that it had earned an average £500,000 a year in the last decade, arrest warrants were issued for Lord Kylsant and John Moreland, the company auditor. At the time the ruse was discovered the company had a trading deficit of £300,000 a year, the reserves were completely exhausted, and the company owed £10 million.|$|E

25|$|Sparks and WFAA's sports director, Dale Hansen, {{decided to}} follow up on the tip and asked Stanley to speak with them {{regarding}} this newest set of allegations of impropriety by SMU. Stanley claimed that SMU athletic officials paid him $25,000 to sign with SMU in 1983 and continued to pay him monthly while he played for the Mustangs. His mother, Dawn, and his father, Harley, were also given money according to Stanley's claims.

2500|$|Tradition {{had it that}} in {{more than}} three centuries, [...] "a Mackintosh and a Cameron had never even spoken together", which of course ignored alliances such as that at the Battle of Inverlochy (1431). The Camerons {{considered}} it something of a Pyrrhic victory, as the pursuit of their claim to Arkaig and Glen Loy over the years had cost them lands worth four times as much. Cameron had problems raising the money, and was offered a loan by the Earl of Atholl in an attempt to curb the power of Argyll, but Argyll offered a similar loan at lower interest. However, there were strings attached, Cameron had to pay £100 Scots in feu-duty and to acknowledge Argyll as superior of the lands.

2500|$|The {{following}} labor clash in April 1903 {{known as}} the Pacific Electric Railway Strike of 1903 {{was caused by the}} unrest of racial divides in labor practices. The Amalgamated Association of Street Railway Employees decided to assist the Mexican laborers working in the Huntington construction gangs to organize their own union. Mexican laborers were hired to lay track in the southwest because their low wage rate, $1.00 to $1.25 for a ten-hour day, was significantly less than other minorities, such as the Chinese, who collected up to $1.75 per day for the same work. [...] The Mexican Federal Union was formed in 1903 and raised great support in the community. Work on the Main Street line was stopped and demands were made to Pacific Electric for increased wages. Huntington refused to meet these demands and replaced them with black, Japanese, and white laborers while <b>still</b> <b>paying</b> them higher wages than had been paid towards the Mexicans.|$|E

2500|$|Finally, the {{plantations}} {{and their}} related agricultural development radically altered Ireland's ecology and physical appearance. [...] In 1600, most of Ireland was heavily wooded, {{apart from the}} bogs. Most of the population lived in small townlands, many migrating seasonally to fresh pastures for their cattle. By 1700, Ireland's native woodland had been decimated; it was intensively exploited by the new settlers for commercial ventures such as shipbuilding, {{as much of the}} English forests had been destroyed and the navy was becoming a great power. Several native species, such as the wolf, were hunted to extinction during this period. Most of the settler population was urbanized, living in permanent towns or villages. Some of the Irish peasantry continued their traditional practices. By the end of the plantation period, almost all of Ireland had become integrated into a market economy. But many of the poorer classes had no access to money, <b>still</b> <b>paying</b> their rents in kind or in service.|$|E
2500|$|From Aztec times, the Centro Histórico used to {{be where}} the wealthy and elite lived. [...] However, in the early 20thcentury, these classes began to move to areas west and {{southwest}} of the Centro, to neighbourhoods such as Colonia Juárez, Colonia Cuauhtémoc, Colonia Roma and Colonia Condesa. The Centro remained the commercial, political and intellectual center through the mid 20thcentury, although it was around this time that UNAM moved most of its facilities to the new Ciudad Universitaria. [...] The reason for {{the decline of the}} city center was partly man-made and partly natural. [...] In the 1940s, the city government froze rents so that until 1998, when the government repealed the law, tenants were <b>still</b> <b>paying</b> what they were in the 1950s. With no financial incentive to keep up their properties, landlords let their buildings disintegrate. The 1985 earthquake took its toll on a number of these structures, which were never fixed or rebuilt, leading to slums with and garbage-strewn vacant lots. The result was the loss of about 100,000residents of the [...] "Colonia Centro", leaving the area almost deserted at night.|$|E
2500|$|Contrary to Truman's expectations, however, Martin {{guarded the}} Fed's independence, not just through Truman's {{administration}} but also through the four administrations that would follow.

He was able to pursue independent monetary policies while <b>still</b> <b>paying</b> heed to the desires of various administrations. Although the objectives of Martin's monetary policy were low inflation and economic stability, he rejected {{the idea that the}} Fed could pursue its policies through the targeting of a single indicator and instead made policy decisions by examining a wide array of economic information. As Chairman, he institutionalized this approach within the proceedings of the FOMC, gathering the opinions of all governors and presidents within the System before making decisions. As a result, his decisions were often supported by unanimous votes on the FOMC. The job of the Federal Reserve, he famously said, is [...] "to take away the punch bowl just as the party gets going," [...] that is, raise interest rates just when economy reaches peak activity after a recession.|$|E

2500|$|The Dubois Brothers {{were known}} to terrorize the owners of nightclubs and bars in order to force the owners into paying {{protection}} taxes and then would begin to take over their business. They {{were known to}} use these tactics similarly with drug dealers, prostitutes, pimps, loan sharks, strippers, thieves and fences. The Brothers would start by frequenting a bar or nightclub either themselves or through sending an associate or cronies, they would begin by seeming friendly {{and then move on}} to picking fights with patrons, vandalizing the premises, commence harassing staff and assaulting the owner in a hostile take over. It would continue to get progressively worse until the owner could not take anymore of the attacks and agreed to what they Dubois Brothers were wanting. Majority of the time {{there seemed to be no}} option for the owners once the Brothers became interested, they would do what it took in order to get what they wanted. [...] The Dubois Brothers would often settle for $100 a week in protection tax or payments, which at the time would have been equivalent to around $1000 a week today, with the Brothers collecting individually from dozens of bars or clubs. One witness, Charles Houle, who owned a bar on Notre Dame street west in Montreal claimed to police that the Dubois Brothers, specifically Raymond, in 1965 had paid a quick visit to his bar shortly they had opened and demanded he pay the weekly fee for the protection tax. It turned out that even at his testimony many years later he was <b>still</b> <b>paying</b> the tax and at this time it was believed to have totalled $50,000. Once there was control over the bar by Dubois Brother they would force integration of other criminal activities such as: control hiring so they could hire criminals, loansharking, drugs, gambling, etc. The owners would have no say in the matter and the criminal activities and the Dubois Brothers would gain a business or home base for their transactions and other criminal business.|$|E
