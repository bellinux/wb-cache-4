2500|$|It was {{the era of}} Emperor Shirakawa. A warrior who was a vassal to Minamoto no Yoriyoshi {{received}} a request from Yoriyoshi to sneak into the enemy territory of Mutsu, and he took along his wife named Iwa while entrusted his young daughter to a nurse as he headed towards Mutsu, but he was slain by the enemy and lost his life. Iwa couldn't bear leaving her husband behind in another land {{to return to her}} homeland, so she decided to <b>stay</b> <b>right</b> <b>there</b> in Mutsu. Several decades later, a traveling young couple requested lodging at the hermitage where Iwa was living. The woman was pregnant. As someone who wanted to return to her homeland but couldn't, Iwa, upon seeing how happy a couple they were and how they were about to be blessed with a child, awakened to feeling of murderous intent against them, and finally took the woman's life with a knife. However, after that Iwa found out that woman was none other than her own daughter, and after crying for all of 7 days and 7 nights, she became mentally unhinged, and became an onibaba that would assault travelers.|$|E

60|$|Morricetown was {{a superb}} spot, and Burton was much {{inclined}} to <b>stay</b> <b>right</b> <b>there</b> and prospect the near-by mountains. So {{far as a}} mere casual observer could determine, this country offers every inducement to prospectors. It is possible to grow potatoes, hay, and oats, together with various small fruits, in this valley, and if gold should ever be discovered in the rushing mountain streams, {{it would be easy}} to sustain a camp and feed it well.|$|E

6000|$|... "Stuck {{it out as}} best we could: <b>stayed</b> <b>right</b> <b>there</b> in the hotel. Poor old Jones {{was pretty}} well collapsed! Couldn't do {{anything}} but sleep and eat, {{and sit on the}} piazza of the hotel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I bought her," [...] said Jeff, [...] "at thirty-two, and she <b>stayed</b> <b>right</b> <b>there</b> tight, {{like she}} was stuck. Then a bunch of these fellers in the city started to drive her down and they got her pushed down to twenty-four, and I held on to her and they shoved her down to twenty-one. This morning they've got her down to sixteen, but I don't mean to let go. No, sir." ...|$|R
5000|$|As his {{mistress}} carries him, they pass Claude who is watching and he sticks out his tongue at Frisky. Frisky escapes and {{his mistress}} yells, [...] "Frisky, {{you come back}} here this minute!" [...] Frisky hides under the couch, and Claude {{goes over to the}} couch skirt and lifts it up with his hind leg as the mistress asks herself, [...] "Where is that dog? Oh there you are, you naughty thing!" [...] and carries him back to the wash tub. We see her pouring hot water into the wash tub when the phone rings. She says, [...] "Oh dear, that phone again! Now you <b>stay</b> <b>right</b> <b>there</b> till I get back!" [...] Frisky is backed into a corner and cannot escape. As Claude tests the water to see how hot it is, Frisky sneaks up behind him and lets out a loud bark. This scares Claude and again he is seen leaping upward out of the scene. Claude causes a splash of hot water from the tub on the way down.|$|E
5000|$|The two-minute fatal {{encounter}} {{started from}} a routine traffic stop, in which Bridgeton officers Braheme Days and Roger Worley pulled over {{a vehicle for}} running through a stop sign. While questioning {{the two men in}} the car, Leroy Tutt and Jerame Reid, the video shows Days suddenly shouting to his partner, [...] "We've got a gun in his glove compartment!" [...] followed by [...] "Show me your fucking hands." [...] Days, who appears to recognize Reid, as he is heard calling him by his first name, retrieves a large silver handgun from the glove compartment. Days continues to warn Reid to not move, as Reid continues to move his hands around inside the vehicle. Several times, Days exclaims, [...] "He's reaching for something!" [...] As the situation intensifies, someone in the vehicle can be heard telling the officers, [...] "I'm not reaching for nothing. I ain't got no reason to reach for nothing." [...] Reid then tells Days, [...] "I'm getting out and getting on the ground." [...] The officer responds, [...] "No you're not, <b>stay</b> <b>right</b> <b>there,</b> don't move." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Alton smiling, [...] "I didn't mean it that way. Work was {{scarce in}} the province, and I'd lost my cattle when Jimmy went {{up with me}} into the ranges to look for silver. He brought his wife along, {{because he had no}} dollars or {{anywhere}} to leave her, and it was a mighty tough place for a woman where we camped under the big glacier. We <b>stayed</b> <b>right</b> <b>there</b> most of the winter. There was only frost and snow, and the wind that whirled it about the pines, and, until it froze up, we lived a good deal on salmon from the river. They were dead when we got them, and some of them rotten." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll {{bring you}} good men in legions; we'll take out your {{high-grade}} ore, but you'll {{remember that the}} building of this railroad wasn't all luxury. Some of those who laid the ties sleep soundly beside them, some lost their money, and now when you have thanked the leaders in Ottawa, Montreal, and Victoria, there are others to whom your thanks are due--the men who <b>stayed</b> <b>right</b> <b>there</b> with their contracts in spite of fire and snow, staking dollar after dollar on a terribly risky game. There were considerable of them, but most of you know this one--I'm sharing my laurels with him--" [...] and as a thunder of applause which followed the halt he made died away he turned toward me. [...] "Stand right up, Contractor Lorimer--they're shouting for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No you don't. You'll <b>stay</b> <b>right</b> here. <b>There</b> ain't goin' {{to be any}} runnin' out an' makin' {{a poison}} play on the street--not with all them jools reposin' under the pillow. Savve? Even if you didn't die, you'd {{be in the hands}} of the police with a lot of {{explanations}} comin'. Emetics is the stuff for poison. I'm just as bad bit as you, an' I'm goin' to take a emetic. That's all they'd give you at a drug store, anyway." ...|$|R
