40|$|The role of state-sponsored <b>sickness</b> {{insurance}} <b>schemes</b> of {{the late}} 19 th and early 20 th centuries on infant health outcomes has largely been ignored even through these schemes provided confinement benefits that diffused proper infant care practices and lengthened the time mothers were able to breastfeed. This paper analyzes the role of <b>sickness</b> insurance <b>schemes</b> on the crude death rate, infant death rate, and non-infant death rates using a fixed-effect effect dynamic panel data model. Although the majority improvements in the death rates due to expansion of coverage were among non-infants, a ten percentage point increase {{in the proportion of}} the adult population covered by sickness insurance reduced the number of infant deaths by 3. 7 to 5. 3 % each year. This reduction among infants is non-trivial and accounts for twenty-five to thirty-five percent of entire reduction in the crude death rate attributed to sickness insurance...|$|R

30|$|The OECD {{countries}} {{spend on}} average around 0.8 % of GDP on sickness benefits alone (OECD 2010, 58). In Norway, where the <b>sickness</b> benefit <b>scheme</b> is particularly generous, around 1.6 – 1.7 % of GDP is allocated to sickness benefits annually (Bjørnstad 2013, 22).

30|$|While the {{necessity}} for short-term sick leave is often based on the employee’s own assessment, long-term sick leave is usually certified by a general practitioner. But whether an employee actually seeks medical help is usually dependent on the employee’s own initiative. This means that the employee’s sick leave might be influenced by own health assessment and the employee’s opinion of when sick leave is needed. Additionally, this implies that the <b>sickness</b> benefit <b>schemes</b> depend on trust in the employees and their assessments.|$|R

50|$|Early {{industrial}} {{sickness insurance}} purchased through employers was one influential economic {{origin of the}} current American health care system. These late-19th-century and early-20th-century <b>sickness</b> insurance <b>schemes</b> were generally inexpensive for workers: their small scale and local administration kept overhead low, and {{because the people who}} purchased insurance were all employees of the same company, that prevented people who were already ill from buying in. The presence of employer-based sickness funds may have contributed to why the idea of government-based insurance did not take hold in the United States {{at the same time that}} the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe was moving toward socialized schemes like the UK National Insurance Act of 1911. Thus, at the beginning of the 20th century, Americans were used to associating insurance with employers, which paved the way for the beginning of third-party health insurance in the 1930s.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To obtain {{information}} on the incidence of rheumatoid arthritis and on its recent trends in Finland. METHODS: The study covered those subjects entitled to receive specially reimbursed medication for rheumatoid arthritis under the nationwide <b>sickness</b> insurance <b>scheme</b> in five out of 21 central hospital districts in Finland (population basis about one million adults) during three years: 1980, 1985, and 1990. RESULTS: The annual incidence of rheumatoid arthritis in 1980 and 1985, satisfying the American Rheumatism Association 1987 classification criteria, was 39 / 100, 000 of the population > or = 16 years of age. The combined incidence of rheumatoid factor (RF) positive arthritis and RF negative polyarthritis was 46 / 100, 000. A decline of approximately 40 % occurred {{in the number of}} RF negative rheumatoid arthritis cases in 1990 compared with the earlier years.

40|$|The {{incidence}} {{and duration of}} work-absence spells for a sample of Swedish blue-collar workers in 1990 and 1991 are analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier non-parametric estimator, discrete-time hazard regression as well as stratified Cox regression. We focus {{on the effect of}} economic incentives, i. e., costs associated with absence from work and individual income, as well as gender differences in work absence behavior. In this context we analyze the effect of a reform of the compulsory <b>sickness</b> insurance <b>scheme,</b> i. e., a decrease in the replacement level, that took place in Sweden in March 1991. Special attention is devoted to gender differences in work-absence behavior. We find {{that it is important to}} consider unobserved heterogeneity and state dependence in the estimations. The results also show that economic incentives seem to matter for the incidence of work-absence. Gender differences in the way economic incentives affect work-absence behavior, rather than differences in the measured variables, appear to be the predominant factor in explaining the higher work-absence rate of females.

50|$|Mrs Geraets-Smits {{claimed the}} refusal of {{reimbursement}} for treatment for Parkinson’s disease in Kassel, which she believed was better than that available in the Netherlands by focusing on individual symptoms, was contrary to TFEU article 56. Mr Peerbooms received neurostimulation treatment in Innsbruck, which likewise {{would not have been}} covered in the Netherlands. Experts testified in both cases that it was unjustified or experimental. Dutch social insurance covered medical costs of low income people, but only if it was approved. Funding came from individual premiums, from the state, and some from other private insurance funds. Geraets-Smits and Peerbooms had paid up front in Germany and Austria. Dutch law said authorisation had required that (1) treatment had to be regarded as ‘normal in the professional circles concerned’, and (2) ‘necessary’ so that adequate care could not be provided without undue delay by a care provider in the home state. The prior authorisation requirement was challenged as being contrary to TFEU article 56. Governments submitted that hospital services were not an economic activity if it was provided free of charge under a <b>sickness</b> insurance <b>scheme.</b>|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, growing {{attention}} has been given to the mental health of workers. One way to examine the mental health of workers {{is to look at the}} incidence rates of mental illness-related sickness absence. There is a scarcity of literature in which the incidence rates of mental illness-related sickness absence among different countries have been considered together. The purpose of this systematic literature review is to address the question: Are there similarities and differences in the incidence rates of mental disorder-related sickness absence among and within OECD identified Social Democratic, Liberal and Latin American country categories? In this paper, we seek to identify differences and similarities in the literature rather than to explain them. With this review, we lay the groundwork for and point to areas for future research as well as to raise questions regarding reasons for the differences and similarities. A systematic literature search of the following databases were performed: Medline Current, Medline In-process, PsycINFO, Econlit and Web of Science. The search period covered 2002 - 2013. The systematic literature search focused on working adults between 18 - 65 years old who had not retired and who had mental and/or substance abuse disorders. Intervention studies were excluded. The search focused on medically certified sickness absences. A total of 3, 818 unique citations were identified. Of these, 10 studies met the inclusion/exclusion criteria; six were from Social Democratic countries. Their quality ranged from good to excellent. There was variation in the incidence rates reported by the studies from the Social Democratic, Liberal and Latin American countries in this review. The results of this systematic review suggest that this is an emerging area of inquiry that needs to continue to grow. Priority areas to support growth include cross jurisdictional collaboration and development of a typology characterizing the benefit generosity and work integration policies of <b>sickness</b> absence <b>schemes.</b> Finally, the literature should be updated to reflect changes in <b>sickness</b> absence benefit <b>schemes</b> over tim...|$|R
40|$|Objectives To {{outline the}} {{principles}} underlying changes overtime in entitlement to sickness absence benefit in Denmark. Methods The Danish <b>sickness</b> benefit <b>scheme</b> {{during the past}} 30 years has been studied based on {{a comprehensive review of}} the Sickness Benefit Act from 1973, and all later amendments to the act. Results Entitlement to sickness benefit in Denmark has undergone considerable changes during the past 30 years. The guiding principles of the reforms have been financial savings in combination with an assumption that human behaviour can be controlled through bureaucratic administration with focus on monitoring and evaluation. Conclusions The Sickness Benefit Act was initially based on a broad concept of disease but the implementation underwent major changes. In the 1970 s and 1980 s entitlement to benefit depended very much on medical diagnosis. This practice changed and today's policy is to some extent a return to the biopsychosocial approach {{in the sense that the}} citizen is not regarded a passive victim of disease but an active player in influencing own working capacity. Added to this is, however, a new element of much tighter control leaving less room for autonomy. ...|$|R
40|$|Subjects with {{ankylosing}} spondylitis (AS) {{have an increased}} incidence of deaths from accidents and violence, which is due in part, but perhaps not entirely, to {{the vulnerability of the}} affected spine to fractures. The present study covered all the 71 subjects (58 men and 13 women) who had died in Finland in 1989 and who were entitled under the nationwide <b>sickness</b> insurance <b>scheme</b> to receive specially reimbursed medication for AS. The death certificates of an earlier cohort study dealing with mortality in AS were also re-examined. Sixteen subjects (14 men and two women) in the 1989 mortality series had died of accidents and violence. Nine of the deaths (three accidents, two suicides and four alcohol poisonings) were alcohol related. The relative risk of such deaths in subjects with AS compared to the Finnish population as a whole was 2. 64 (95 % confidence interval 1. 44 – 4. 84). In the cohort study, 16 deaths had been due to accidents and violence, the expected number being 11. 4. Eight of the 16 deaths had been alcohol related. Uncontrolled use of alcohol is an important determinant in the surplus of deaths from accidents and violence in Finnish patients with AS...|$|R
50|$|Outside the Benevolent Irish Society (BIS), {{there were}} two fraternal {{organizations}} to which Irish Catholics in Newfoundland belonged. The earliest to be established in Newfoundland was the Irish Mechanics' Society, organized in March 1827. The Mechanics' Society was established as a self-help and educational society by four skilled tradesmen, Patrick Kelly, Edmond Power, Louis Martin, and William Walsh. The Society provided a meeting place and educational opportunities for its members, a <b>sickness</b> insurance <b>scheme,</b> and a program of benefits for injured members or the families of deceased members. Many of the early members of the Mechanics' Society were Irish Catholics from St. John's, but intra-Irish county origins, and membership in Irish provincial factions the Tipperary Clear Airs, the Wexford Yellowbellies, the Waterford Wheybellies, the Kilkenny Doones, and the Cork Dadyeens may also have {{played a part in}} determining its membership. Like the Benevolent Irish Society, the rules of the Mechanics' Society prohibited members from formally discussing political or religious questions, but the Society occasionally took a public political stand. In 1829 it participated in a large parade through St. John's to celebrate the Catholic emancipation. Many of its early leaders became prominent in political life.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} firms' participation in an insurance scheme on the long-term sickness absence of their employees, using administrative records. In Denmark and several other European countries, firms are obliged to cover {{the first two weeks}} of <b>sickness.</b> The insurance <b>scheme</b> is provided by government authority and is designed to help small firms with the financial burden related to sickness absence of their workers. We use an exogenously-set threshold for the eligibility as a policy experiment. Using regression discontinuity in the fuzzy form, we show that sickness absence in insured firms is much more prevalent than in uninsured firms. Sickness spells in insured firms are shorter and the conditional probability to return back to work from sickness is much higher in insured firms. These results suggest that employees in insured firms are less monitored during the first two weeks and that their sickness is less serious. We demonstrate in the paper that the minimum cost of the present insurance scheme is similar to about 1100 man-years. On top of that comes a substantial cost to more short time sickness...|$|R
40|$|The {{assessment}} of sickness absence {{is a challenge}} in spite of accessible numbers of spells, persons, and days of absence in public and employer registers. Concepts and their definitions are still to a small extent standardized, and clear and explicit definitions need to be provided. In epidemiological studies, {{the definition of the}} study base is important, and in sickness absence research a prerequisite is that an individual belongs to a <b>sickness</b> absence insurance <b>scheme.</b> Population at risk can be identified at three levels: the general population, the sickness insured population, and the sickness absent population. Cases in sickness absence studies can be quantified in terms of spell-, person-, or time based measurements. Each of these ways reflects different contents of sickness absence as a phenomenon, and the choice of measurement should be guided by {{the purpose of the study}} as well as the target area. Five different measurements (frequency, length, cumulative incidence, incidence rate, and duration) are suggested and their application is discussed. These five measurements can be seen as a summary of measurements used in different studies and an application of epidemiologic methods into sickness absence research. There are opportunities to increase the quality of sickness absence research, with an increased awareness of the importance of the measurements used. </span...|$|R
40|$|Norway's {{economy has}} gone through {{unprecedented}} growth in the past decade. The strong growth in GDP, employment, labor productivity, real wage, and labor immigration combines with increasing outflows from the labor force, such as early retirement <b>scheme,</b> <b>sickness</b> and disability, and old age retirement implies that Norway's labor market is tight. We hypothesize demographic changes and skilled and unskilled job composition affects tertiary education participation through wage premium and job opportunities. Motivation to pursue tertiary education is determined by perceived wage premium, expected foregone earnings, expected relative lifetime earnings, and ease of finding jobs. Among the four elements, expected foregone earnings have the most weight when individuals decide whether to pursue tertiary education or not. Thus, we propose policies to minimize individuals' expected foregone earnings, such as voluntary-base internship to tertiary students and online tertiary education for the mature students in age group 30 - 35. On the other hand, we propose the government to establish agencies in countries that have high skilled labor reserve with lower living stand than Norway. These agencies will disseminate information labor market and regulatory issues of Norway and to market the attractiveness of Norway as a migration destination. Lastly, we propose the government to further entice foreign students {{to come to the}} country. These students can be a potential skilled labor supply after they graduate...|$|R
40|$|Sickness and {{disability}} {{is a key}} economic policy concern for many OECD countries. Medical conditions, or problems labelled as such by societies and policy systems, are proving an increasing obstacle to raising labour force participation and keeping public expenditure under control. More and more people of working age rely on sickness {{and disability}} benefits as their main source of income, and the employment rates of those reporting disabling conditions are low. There is now an urgent need to address this “medicalisation ” of labour market problems. In the current economic downturn, {{there is a risk}} that countries may be tempted to revert to using <b>sickness</b> and disability <b>schemes</b> to massage politically sensitive unemployment figures. The current context makes the reforms in Sweden especially important, but potentially more challenging to manage politically. The OECD’s Thematic Review on Sickness, Disability and Work examines national policies to control the inflow into sickness and disability benefit programmes, and to assist those beneficiaries who are able to work to reintegrate the labour market. It attempts to discover what leads a person with a health problem to withdraw from the labour market or remain outside of it, and to identify areas for further policy improvement. The main concern of the review is with people who could work but do not work. Many people with health problems can work and want to work, so any policy based on th...|$|R
40|$|Sickness absence has varied {{considerably}} in Sweden {{over time and}} increased substantially between 1997 and 2002, especially among women. The composition of such absence has also changed in {{that there have been}} increases in sick leave due to mental illness, prolongation of sickness absence periods, and a larger proportion of women than men on long-term sick leave. The general aim of the research presented in this thesis was to identify societal and work- and health-related factors underlying the fluctuations in long-term sickness absence (LTSA) in Sweden over the last two decades. Another objective was to identify important risk factors for LTSA among women and men in the working population, considering characteristics of work, family, and individual. In Paper I, aggregated monthly data (December 1992 September 2008) were used to assess structural factors associated with variations in the number of ongoing spells of LTSA (> 59 days). Although specific changes in the <b>sickness</b> insurance <b>scheme</b> may have had an impact, no consistent pattern of associations was found. Furthermore, in contrast to previous studies, the present findings indicated that the composition of the labour force was less relevant for explaining variations in LTSA over the last decades. Instead, it emerged that LTSA was associated with public health indicators such as alcohol sales and factors connected with working conditions and worker health. Paper II employed two similar cross-sectional case-control studies covering 1986 − 1989 and 2002. The aim was to investigate changes over time in risk factors for LTSA and changes in the fraction of LTSA attributable to these risk factors. Both studies were based on samples of longterm sick listed (> 59 days) and samples of employed in ages 20 to 64 as a comparison group. The results indicate an association between female sex and LTSA in 2002. Also, different aspects of the psychosocial work environment and the job situation were more pertinent risk factors for LTSA in 2002 than in the late 1980 s. Still, the relevance of an adverse physical work environment is evident for both male and female employees. An increased population at risk over time contributed substantially to LTSA, and the most evident examples were an ageing workforce, adverse psychosocial work environments, and overweight or obesity. The specific aim of the research reported in Paper III was to investigate the relevance of the demand-control model and social support in predicting LTSA, and to identify gender- and employment-sector-specific patterns. The data from 2002 used in Paper II were analysed. Associations with LTSA were found for weak social support and high-strain jobs among both sexes, and for active jobs among women. The relevance of the demand-control model for LTSA was more evident in the private sector than in the public sector. Paper IV presents a longitudinal cohort study of employees aged 25 50, which was performed to elucidate the association between work-to-family and family-to-work interference and LTSA (> 14 days). The overall association between work-family interference in 2004, and subsequent LTSA during follow-up in 2005 was weak. However, among men with higher socioeconomic status, and to some extent also among women taking the main responsibility for housework and family, interference from work-to-family was associated with LTSA. In conclusion, the major finding of the current research is that the deterioration in psychosocial work environments during the 1990 s was an important factor leading to increased LTSA between 1997 and 2002. Moreover, the rise in LTSA was reinforced by other changes, such as an ageing workforce and changes in lifestyle factors. The adverse psychosocial work environments are significant not only because they are pertinent risk factors for LTSA, but also because they have become more common within the working population. With dual-earner families as the dominant norm in Sweden, balance between work and family also represents a factor that affects worker health and LTSA...|$|R
