40|$|Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) {{have been}} {{conceived}} {{to increase the}} transmissibility of electric power without the necessity of building new transmission lines. An important family of controllers proposed for FACTS are based on high power <b>solid-state</b> <b>switches,</b> such as the gate-turn-off thyristor (GTO), which is presently rated at 6 kV, 6 kA. The FACTS controller operates at the transmission voltage, {{in the order of}} 500 kV, and it must be rated at hundreds of MVA. The research of this thesis contributes in developing the methodologies necessary for the integration of the <b>solid-state</b> <b>switches</b> so that the FACTS controllers have the voltage withstand and the current carrying capacity. The methodologies followed in the thesis are based on organizing the <b>solid-state</b> <b>switches</b> firstly in the forms of: (a) 2 -level, voltage-source converter modules or (b) multilevel, voltage-source, converter modules. Thereafter, the modules are connected in series and/or in parallel.
