40|$|This paper {{presents}} an optimization procedure for high-efficiency {{design of a}} mixed-flow pump. Optimization techniques based on a weighted-average surrogate model are used to optimize a vane diffuser of a mixed-flow pump. Validation of the numerical results is performed through experimental data for head, power and efficiency. Three-level full factorial design is used to generate nine design points within the design space. Three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations with the shear stress transport turbulence model are discretized by using finite volume approximation and solved on hexahedral grids to evaluate the efficiency as the objective function. In order to reduce pressure loss in the vane diffuser, two variables defining the <b>straight</b> <b>vane</b> length ratio and the diffusion area ratio are selected as design variables in the present optimization. As {{the results of the}} design optimization, the efficiency at the design flow coefficient is improved by 7. 05 % and the off-design efficiencies are also improved in comparison with the reference design...|$|E

40|$|Design of {{the brake}} disc {{geometry}} {{for a given}} brake disc material {{provides an opportunity for}} improvement in the fatigue life of the brake disc. High thermomechanical loads at braking lead to substantial local plastification and also induce tensile residual stresses in certain areas of the brake disc. This contributes to shortening of the fatigue life of the brake disc by possible initiation and growth of cracks. In the present paper, a simulation approach for evaluation of brake disc designs with respect to thermomechanical performance is developed and applied. Brake disc performance is analysed using commercial finite element software by employing a constitutive model for grey cast iron implemented in a Fortran subroutine. The thermal loading consists of consecutive severe braking cycles at a constant brake power and a constant speed, with cooling between the brake cycles. Based on a previous experimental study, three different assumptions are made regarding the spatial distribution of the thermal load at braking. A standard commercial brake disc made from grey cast iron having <b>straight</b> <b>vanes</b> is used as the reference case. Geometrical modifications are introduced in the ventilation arrangement using a design-of-experiments approach, studying both <b>straight</b> cooling <b>vanes</b> and different pillar layouts. A preliminary assessment of the fatigue life of the brake discs is carried out. The results indicate that the introduction of different pillar arrangements instead of <b>straight</b> <b>vanes</b> make it possible to decrease the mass of the brake disc by up to 13 % or to increase the fatigue life of the brake disc by about 50 %...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{numerical}} simulations {{are conducted}} {{to investigate the}} effects of bowed outlet guide vanes (OGVs) on endwall heat transfer and aerodynamic performance. Both on- and off-design conditions are studied. For bowed vanes, the bowed angle varies from 10 degrees to 40 degrees and the normalized bowed height ranges from 0. 1 to 0. 3. Results are included for Nusselt number distributions on the endwall, the energy losses, the yaw angles, and near-wall flow structures. For the convenience of comparison, the <b>straight</b> <b>vane</b> is also studied as a baseline. It is found that the bowed vanes can effectively reduce the endwall heat transfer. Among the tested parameters, a bowed angle of 40 degrees and a normalized bowed height of 0. 3 provide the best-controlled heat transfer for both the on- and off-design conditions. However, the bowed vanes have different effects on the energy losses and the yaw angles depending on the operating conditions. For the on-design condition with the inlet angle of 30 degrees (the incidence angle is 0 degrees) and the off-design condition with the inlet angle of 0 degrees, the bowed vanes do not significantly increase the energy losses and yaw angles, whereas for the off-design condition with the inlet angle of - 30 degrees, significant changes are observed...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates a {{variable}} geometry (VG) mixed flow turbine with a novel, purposely designed pivoting nozzle vane ring. The nozzle vane ring was matched to the 3 -dimensional {{aspect of the}} mixed flow rotor leading edge with lean stacking. It was found that for a nozzle vane ring in a volute, the vane surface pressure is highly affected by the flow in the volute rather than the adjacent vane surface interactions, especially at closer nozzle positions. The performance of the VG mixed flow turbine has been evaluated experimentally in steady and unsteady flow conditions. The VG mixed flow turbine shows higher peak efficiency and swallowing capacity at various vane angle settings compared to an equivalent nozzleless turbine. Comparison with an equivalent <b>straight</b> <b>vane</b> arrangement shows a higher swallowing capacity but similar efficiencies. The VG turbine unsteady performance was found to deviate substantially from the quasi-steady assumption compared to a nozzleless turbine. This is more evident in the higher vane angle settings (smaller nozzle passage), where there are high possibility of choking during a pulse cycle.

Velocity measurements performed on the UCC test rig at the Air Force Institute of Technology revealed flow patterns and time-averaged turbulence statistics for data taken burning hydrogen fuel in a straight and a curved cavity vane configuration. Over an equivalence ratio from 0. 7 to 1. 5, the <b>straight</b> <b>vane</b> configuration showed spanwise velocity decreased linearly with distance from the cavity vane over {{the width of the}} main channel. Increasing the flow rates and holding the equivalence ratio and ratio of cavity to main airflow rates constant, flow velocities in the main channel showed an increase with the curved circumferential configuration but a decrease with the straight circumferential configuration. Turbulence intensity {{is expected to be a}} major contributing factor, specifically since measured at 15 % and 21 % in the main channel for the straight and curved configurations, respectively. The results also show how the radial vane cavity (RVC) created strong vorticity throughout the main flow supporting a recirculation zone for mixing. Peak vorticity occurred farthest from the cavity vane suggesting the angle of the radial vane cavity is effective in generating increasing flow rotation...|$|E

This means that for the design of an accurate production process the deformation of the tools has to be accounted for. The shape rolling of symmetrical <b>straight</b> <b>vanes</b> has been investigated. Because these vanes have a constant cross-section over the length, this rolling process can be considered as a stationary process.

40|$|Utilizing {{raised floor}} system to {{facilitate}} cable management becomes {{a trend in}} modern intelligent buildings. Underfloor ventilation systems, which {{make use of the}} sub-floor plenum below the raised floor for conditioned air distribution, are also gaining popularity. The ductless operating principle of the underfloor ventilation system enhances space flexibility. Supplying conditioned air from the floor level also inherents advantages in improving indoor air quality and energy saving. Two types of the underfloor ventilation systems are commonly found including the top-level return type (TR) and the floor-level return type (FR). Thermal comfort and indoor air quality aspects of both the TR and the FR. underfloor systems were experimentally investigated in the present study. The most commonly used <b>straight</b> <b>vane</b> type floor supply diffusers were used in the experiments. The performance of traditional ceiling-based system with widely adopted 4 -way spread type supply diffusers was also determined under the same conditions for comparison purpose. A controlled experimental room was developed to facilitate the experiments. High risk of draught was observed near the supply outlet of the underfloor ventilation systems. However, draught discomfort can be reduced by the underfloor system compared to the ceiling based system. Similar to the traditional ceiling based system, vertical temperature differences in the occupied region were lower than 3 °C under all the tested conditions for the TR system. Temperature variations higher than the international comfort standards were observed with the FR system when Archimedes number (Ar) was higher than 0. 03. Lower Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) values were resulted with both types of underfloor ventilation systems compared to the ceiling-based one. Lower cooling effect should be provided when using the underfloor systems to avoid overcooling to the occupants. The age of air experiments showed that the ceiling-based system maintained a uniform distribution of ventilation in the space. Compared to the ceiling-based system, improvements in ventilation were achieved with the use of TR or FR system in regions near the floor supply outlet. In spaces that were far away from the floor supply outlet, the ventilation performance of the FR system deteriorated. The performance of the TR system was found similar to the ceiling based system at far distance. The TR system was the most efficient one in removing smoke particles inside the whole room. The FR system removed particles in {{the lower part of the}} room better than the ceiling-based system. Improvements in particle concentration in the sitting person breathing level were achieved by the FR system...|$|E
40|$|Gas turbine {{combustion}} chambers were traditionally designed through {{trial and error}} which was unfortunately a time-consuming and expensive process. The development of computers, however, contributed a great deal to the development of {{combustion chambers}}, enabling one to model such systems more accurately in less time. Traditionally, preliminary combustor designs were conducted with the use of one-dimensional codes to assist in the prediction of flow distributions and pressure losses across the combustion chamber mainly due to their rapid execution times and ease of use. The results are generally used as boundary conditions in three- dimensional models to predict the internal flow field of the combustor. More recent studies solve the entire flow field from prediffuser to combustor exit. This approach is, however, a computationally expensive procedure and can only be used if adequate computer resources are available. The {{purpose of this study is}} two-fold; (1) to develop a one-dimensional incompressible code, incorporating an empirical-based combustion model, to assist a one-dimensional network solver in predicting flow- and temperature distributions, as well as pressure losses. This is done due to the lack of a combustion model in the network solver that was used. An incompressible solution of flow splits, pressure losses, and temperature distributions is also obtained and compared with the compressible solution obtained by the network solver; (2) to utilise the data, obtained from the network solver, as boundary conditions to a three-dimensional numerical model to investigate possible modifications to the dome wall of a standard T 56 combustion chamber. A numerical base case model is validated against experimental exit temperature data, and based upon that comparison, the remaining numerical models are compared with the numerical base case. The effect of the modification on the dome wall temperature is therefore apparent when the modified numerical model is compared with the numerical base case. A second empirical code was developed to design the geometry of axial <b>straight</b> <b>vane</b> swirlers with different swirl angles. To maintain overall engine efficiency, the pressure loss that was determined from the network analysis, of the base case model, is used during the design of the different swirlers. The pressure loss across the modified combustion chamber will therefore remain similar to that of the original design. Hence, to maintain a constant pressure loss across the modified combustion chambers, the network solver is used to determine how many existing hole features should be closed for the pressure loss to remain similar. The hole features are closed, virtually, in such a manner as not to influence the equivalence ratio in each zone significantly, therefore maintaining combustion performance similar to that of the original design. Although the equivalence ratios in each combustion zone will be more or less unaffected, the addition of a swirler will influence the emission levels obtained from the system due to enhanced air-fuel mixing. A purely numerical parametric analysis was conducted to investigate the influence of different swirler geometries on the dome wall temperature while maintaining an acceptable exit temperature distribution. The data is compared against the data obtained from an experimentally validated base case model. The investigation concerns the replacement of the existing splash-cooling devices on the dome wall with that of a single swirler. A number of swirler parameters such as blade angle, mass flow rate, and number of blades were varied during the study, investigating its influence on the dome wall temperature distribution. Results showed that the swirlers with approximately the same mass flow as the existing splash-cooling devices had almost no impact on the dome wall temperatures but maintained the exit temperature profile. An investigation of swirlers with an increased mass flow rate was also done and results showed that these swirlers had a better impact on the dome wall temperatures. However, due to the increased mass flow rate, stable combustion is not guaranteed since the air/fuel ratio in the primary combustion zone was altered. The conclusion that was drawn from the study, was that by simply adding an axial air swirler might reduce high-temperature gradients on the dome but will not guarantee stable combustion during off-design operating conditions. Therefore, a complete new hole layout design might be necessary to ensure good combustion performance across a wide operating range.

VGT has proven to provide air boost for wide engine speed range as well as reduce turbo-lag. This thesis presents the design and experimental evaluation of a variable geometry mixed flow turbocharger turbine. The mixed flow rotor {{used in this study}} consists of 12 blades with a constant inlet blade angle of + 20 °, a cone angle of 50 ° and a tip diameter of 95. 2 mm. A variable geometry stator has been designed within this work, consists of 15 vanes fitted into a ring mechanism with a pivoting range between 40 ° and 80 °. A novel nozzle vane was designed to have 40 ° lean stacking (from the axial direction). This geometrically achieves 3 -dimensional match with the mixed flow rotor and aims to improve the turbine stage performance. A conventional <b>straight</b> nozzle <b>vane</b> was also constructed {{in order to have a}} comparative design to assess the benefits of the new lean vane. The steady flow performance results are presented for vane angle settings of 40 °, 50 °, 60 °, 65 ° and 70 ° over a non-dimensional speed range of 0. 833 - 1. 667. The tests have been carried out with a permanent magnet eddy current dynamometer within a velocity ratio range of 0. 47 to 1. 09. The optimum efficiency of the variable geometry turbine was found to be approximately 5 percentage points higher than the baseline nozzleless unit. The peak efficiency of the variable geometry turbine corresponds to vane angle settings between 60 ° and 65 °, for both the lean and <b>straight</b> <b>vanes.</b> The maximum total-to-static efficiency of the turbine with lean vanes configuration was measured to be 79. 8 % at a velocity ratio of 0. 675. The equivalent value with <b>straight</b> <b>vanes</b> configuration is 80. 4 % at a velocity ratio of 0. 673. The swallowing capacity of the turbine was shown to increase with the lean vanes, as much as 17 % at 70 ° vane angle and pressure ratio of 1. 7. The turbine pulsating flow performance is presented for 50 % and 80 % equivalent speed conditions and a pulse frequency range of 20 - 80 Hz, these frequencies correspond to an engine speed range of 800 - 3200 RPM respectively. The turbine was observed to go through a period of choking within a pulse for vane angle settings between 60 ° - 70 °. The unsteady efficiency of a nozzled turbine was found to exhibit larger deviation from the quasi-steady curve compared to a nozzlesless turbine, by as much as - 19. 4 percentage points. This behaviour was found to be more pronounced towards the close nozzle settings, where the blockage effect is dominant. The nozzle ring was also shown to act as a “restrictor” which shields the turbine rotor from being completely exposed to the unsteadiness of the flow. This coupled with the phase shifting ambiguity was shown to result in the inaccuracy of the point-by-point instantaneous efficiency; where as much as 25 % of a cycle exhibits instantaneous efficiency above unity. Finally the turbine was tested by adapting to the pulsating flow (20 - 60 Hz) by cyclic variation in the opening and closing of the nozzle vanes, called Active Control Turbocharger (A. C. T.). The nozzle vane operating schedules for each pulse period were evaluated experimentally in two general modes; natural oscillating opening/closing of the nozzle vanes due to the pulsating flow and the forced sinusoidal oscillation of the vanes to match the incoming pulsating flow. The spring stiffness was found to be a dominant factor in the effectiveness of the natural oscillation mode. In the best setting, the turbine energy extraction was shown to improve by 6. 1 % over a cycle for the 20 Hz flow condition. In overall it was demonstrated an optimum A. C. T. operating condition could be achieved by allowing the nozzle ring to oscillate naturally in pulsating flow, against an external spring pre-load, which eliminates the use of complex mechanism and external drive. However, the current result suggest the benefits of A. C. T. are best realised in large low speed engines. Open Acces...|$|R

Depending on the application, {{a wide variety of}} brake discs have been developed, with a multitude of designs, geometries and materials. The brake disc materials used for heavy-duty vehicles are still mostly based on traditional grey cast iron, due to its favourable performance and low cost. Gradual improvements of the thermal and mechanical properties of grey cast iron for production of brake discs have been introduced over the years through fine-tuning of the alloying elements. Nevertheless, because of a material behaviour that comprises non-linear elasticity and non-symmetric yield stress in tension and compression, the mechanical properties of grey cast iron are not as well established as those of steel or aluminium alloys. The subject of the present work is {{a better understanding of the}} mechanisms that control the life of cast iron brake discs. In the end, the aim is an enhanced vehicle performance and reduced maintenance costs of heavy-duty vehicles. First, a state of the art survey has been carried out with a review of brake disc technology and mechanisms related to brake disc life. Second, full-scale brake dynamometer experiments have been carried out and analysed, with brake discs made from eight different grey cast iron alloys, at controlled torque, speed and cooling conditions. Crack propagation and disc temperatures have been studied. Disc temperatures were recorded by use of a thermocamera and embedded thermocouples. Detailed analyses were performed on temperature data to clarify characteristics of the tested brake discs. The main phenomena influencing the life of brake discs were identified, and the spatial fixation of bands and/or hot spots was found to have a major impact on disc life.

The model was calibrated for temperatures relevant for braking applications using dedicated isothermal tests and, finally, validated against monotonic tensile tests, isothermal fatigue tests and thermomechanical fatigue tests.

This paper recalls some important achievements in R&D of artificial heart in past 25 years and shares author’s experiences with the readers. PULSATILE OR NONPULSATILE FLOW In the early 1980 s, people did not know whether a nonpulsatile pump could support the circulation partly or totally. Most medical doctors preferred to use pulsatile flow pumps, but the serious problems resulted in the application of diaphragm pumps forced the researchers to change the pumping principle. It followed thereafter two tendencies that some one tried to maintain the animal circulation with nonpulsatile flow as long as possible and others made efforts to develop a pulsatile rotary pump. The conflict of nonpulsatile or pulsatile perfusion lasted to the end of 1990 s. As the author published a pulsatile impeller pump with low hemolysis (Artificial Organs, 1989 / 13 / 02 P 162 - 169), the nonpulsatile pump could make the animal experimental survival only few weeks. Then the author received over 20 international invitations for giving lectures, sending reprints or writing new papers. In the following 10 years, however, nonpulsatile pump achieved long-term survival in animal experiments worldwide [1], and now a patient has lived by a nonpulsatile pump for about 7 years [2]. Thereby, nobody concerns pulsatile rotary pump any more. Fig. (1). Pulsatile impeller pump changes its rotating speed periodically to produce flow waves and thereby its rotor reciprocates axially under action of hydraulic force and magnetic force in motor. *Address correspondence to this author at the Jiangsu University, Biomedica...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} part of automobile safety is the braking system. Disc brakes {{have been widely used}} in automobiles for sped retardation for over 30 years. During that time, they have developed from a simple disc to a complex disc with channels, vanes, holes and grooves. The stopping capability of disc brakes is affected by the rate at which heat is dissipated by forced convection and the thermal capacity of the rotor. Catastrophic failure of brake rotors can occur during rapid increases or decreases in rotor temperature where regions of high temperature gradients result in high thermal strains. There is little information in the public domain regarding the relative merits of different disc brake rotor geometries, particularly in terms of airflow patterns, heat transfer rates, and internal thermal gradients. The aim of this research project was to investigate how geometrical variations affect the thermal performance of bi-directional disc brake rotors, particularly for high performance applications. Dynamometer testing showed that respectable increases in braking performance are achievable with relatively simple machining modifications. Tuft and smoke visualization techniques provided a preliminary understanding of the airflow in the passages of three distinct bi-directional rotor designs. Particle Image Velocimetry was used for detailed flow measurements which supported the numerical simulations. Computational Fluid Dynamics was used to predict the airflow and heat transfer associated with eight bi-directional brake rotor designs. The results show that 'pillared' passage designs can achieve higher heat transfer rates than traditional <b>straight</b> radial <b>vane</b> designs and that the heat loss from pillared rotors is generally more uniform than from vaned rotors. Subsequent conjugate heat transfer simulations found that temperature gradients inside pillared rotors are typically lower than inside vaned rotors. Thus failure rates due to excessive thermal strain are expected to be lower for pillared rotors. It was shown that rotor selection based solely on heat transfer rates is inappropriate and different passage designs are suited to different applications. The findings of this research will directly benefit local disc brake manufacturers, who do not have resources to conduct thorough studies comparing the thermal characteristics of different brake rotor designs...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{new trend}} to convert the {{workplaces}} from individual office rooms to open offices for motivating money saving and better communication. With such a shift the ability of existing ventilation systems in meeting the new requirements is a challenging question for researchers. The available options could {{have an impact on}} workers' health in terms of providing acceptable levels of thermal comfort and indoor air quality. Thus, this experimental investigation focuses on the performances of three different air distribution systems in an open-plan office space. The investigated systems were: mixing ventilation with ceiling-mounted inlets, confluent jets ventilation and underfloor air distribution with <b>straight</b> and curved <b>vanes.</b> Although this represents a small part of our more extensive experimental investigation, the results show that all the purposed stratified ventilation systems (CJV and UFAD) were more or less behaving as mixing systems with some tendency for displacement effects. Nevertheless, it is known that the mixing systems have a stable flow pattern but has the disadvantage of mixing contaminated air with the fresh supplied air which may produce lower performance and in worst cases occupants' illness. For the open-plan office we studied here, it will be shown that the new systems are capable of performing better than the conventional mixing systems. As expected, the higher air exchange efficiency in combination with lower local mean age of air for corner-mounted CJV and floor-mounted UFAD grills systems indicates that these systems are suitable for open-plan offices and are to be favored over conventional mixing systems...|$|R
40|$|A {{test program}} has been {{conducted}} in which the use of pilot-scale centrifugal solvent extraction contactors for cesium removal from an alkaline waste stream has been successfully demonstrated. The program was designed specifically {{to evaluate the use}} of centrifugal contactors having 5 -cm-diam rotors for the removal of cesium from alkaline high-level waste (HLW) that was generated and is being stored at the U. S. Department of Energy's Savannah River Site (SRS). The removal of cesium from this waste is highly desirable because it will reduce the volume of waste that must be treated and disposed of as HLW. The parameters applied in the test effort are those that have been established for the Caustic-Side Solvent Extraction (CSSX) process, a multistage extraction operation that has been designed by researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). In the CSSX process, cesium is extracted by calix(4) arene-bis-(fert-octylbenzo-crown- 6), commonly referred to as BOBCalixC 6. The extract is scrubbed with dilute (0. 05 M) nitric acid, both to remove coextracted elements (primarily potassium and sodium) and to adjust the pH of the extract to facilitate recovery of the cesium. The scrubbed solvent is contacted with 0. 001 M HNO{sub 3 }, which results in the stripping of the cesium from the solvent into the aqueous acid. The CSSX process flow rates have been established so to produce a cesium concentration in the strip effluent that is 12 to 15 times the concentration in the waste stream that enters the extraction section of the cascade. Results from initial hydraulic testing of a commercially available 5 -cm contactor under CSSX conditions indicated that the mixing of feed solutions within the unit (which is critical to efficient solute transfer) was limited by a feature of the contactor that was designed to increase throughput and improve separation performance. In the design, phase separation is improved by reducing turbulence within the contactor. Subsequent to the initial hydraulic test: cesium transfer tests were performed using contactors arranged in both single-stage and multistage arrangements. Results of these tests confirmed that phase mixing within the contactor was inadequate. In an effort to improve mixing within the contactor and thereby increase mass transfer efficiency, two minor modifications were made to a single contactor unit. One modification was the replacement of the bottom plate from the vendor-supplied contactor housing, which was equipped with curved (impeller-type) vanes, with a bottom assembly that had <b>straight</b> radial <b>vanes.</b> The latter configuration is the standard used in all existing ANL, ORNL, and SRS contactor designs. The second modification involved enlargement of the opening {{in the bottom of the}} rotor through which dispersion from the contactor mixing zone enters the rotor for separation. By increasing the rotor opening sufficiently, the rotor loses pumping efficiency to such an extent that accumulation of a hydrostatic head in the annular mixing zone is required for solution to be pumped through the contactor to the organic and aqueous discharge ports. By causing a volume of liquid to accumulate in the mixing zone, it is expected that phase mixing will be improved. Following modification of a contactor, hydraulic testing was repeated to determine flow parameters to be applied in mass transfer testing using the modified device. As expected, test results indicated that the maximum throughputs that could be achieved using the modified contactor under extraction and stripping conditions were lower than those obtained using the ''as-received'' unit. However, phase separation performance within the reduced operating envelope was excellent. Most importantly, cesium transfer stage efficiencies were significantly improved over those obtained using the unmodified device and resulted in attainment of the target CSSX process decontamination factor of 40, 000 when extrapolated to the baseline CSSX contactor cascade...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} a shroud bleed slot system of a compressor stage from a turbocharger unit used in heavy duty diesel engines of approximately 300 kW. The {{first part of the}} work presented in this thesis deals with a detailed analysis of a compressor stage with and without a shroud bleed slot, and various slot geometries which include three different widths and three different positions of the slot. The second stage of this study is an investigation of an addition of a set of vanes in the annular cavity of the shroud bleed slot system. This investigation was performed using both CFD modelling and experimental measurements. The CFD model used a full stage steady state approach. Very good agreement was achieved between the experimental measurements of efficiency, pressure ratio and mass flow rate and those values predicted by the CFD model over the entire performance map, providing confidence in the CFD model as a tool to help understand the flow features of the bleed slot, its various geometries and an addition of annular cavity vanes. The first stage of the study emphasises the significance of the inclusion of a shroud bleed slot into the conventional turbocharger compressor stage and the appropriate choice of the slot geometry in order to achieve as the widest map possible. In comparison with the non-bleed slot compressor stage, the bleed slot significantly extended the map width at the higher speeds, by reducing the surge mass flow rate. However, no or very little improvement was found at lower speeds. The analysis of changes to design parameters revealed that it is vital to obtain an optimised geometry of the bleed slot system for a compressor stage to achieve a wider map without compromising other performance characteristics of the compressor. This study also discloses the importance of an optimised shape of the shroud bleed slot system to increase the compressor performance by avoiding the recirculation losses within the slot and cavity passages at both choke and surge flow conditions. In the second stage of the work presented in this thesis, three different types of the annular cavity <b>vane</b> (<b>straight,</b> positive curved and negative curved vanes) have been designed and investigated. The purpose of the annular cavity vane technique is to remove some of the positive swirl that can be carried through the bleed slot system, which would influence the pressure ratio. In addition to this, the series of cavity vanes provides better guidance to the slot recirculating flow before it mixes with the impeller main inlet flow. Better guidance of the flow improves the mixing at the inducer inlet in the circumferential direction. As a consequence, the stability of the compressor is improved at lower flow rates and a wider map can be achieved. The impact of these three cavity vane designs on the map width and performance of the compressor has been highlighted through a detailed analysis of the impeller and cavity vane bleed slot flow field. Interestingly, all three types of cavity vane showed an improvement in map width by moving the surge point to a lower mass flow rate with no significant efficiency penalty over the entire operating range. This improvement was most evident at the highest running speed. In particular, the negative curved vane showed a significant increase in map width which re{{presents an}} extra 67 % improvement in map width that was achieved between the baseline bleed slot and non-bleed slot configurations.
