40|$|Summary. The {{purpose of}} the paper {{was an attempt to}} {{evaluate}} a stochastic character of gas <b>scavenge</b> measure-ments to a crankcase. It was noticed in laboratory and workshop measurements that test results of <b>scavenge</b> are random and often ambiguous. In the paper the author tried to explain a reason of test result variations. Statistical analysis of gas <b>scavenge</b> measurements was performed on the SB- 3. 1 testing one-cylinder engine at selected rotational speeds of an engine’s crankshaft. Selection of specifi ed speeds was based on a course of <b>scavenge</b> characteristics in a rotational speed function of the engine’s crankshaft...|$|R
5|$|Amanita ceciliae is {{considered}} an edible mushroom and used as food, although many field guides recommend to avoid eating it. Others recommend it as a good edible species. A study of 16 edible mushrooms was done to learn about their chemical compositions and antioxidant activities. Among these species, A.ceciliae and Pleurotus ostreatus were the two mushrooms that showed most powerful radical <b>scavenging</b> activities.|$|E
5|$|Common ravens are {{omnivorous}} {{and highly}} opportunistic: their diet may vary widely with location, season and serendipity. For example, those foraging on tundra on the Arctic North Slope of Alaska obtained about half their energy needs from predation, mainly of microtine rodents, and half by <b>scavenging,</b> mainly of caribou and ptarmigan carcasses.|$|E

40|$|Chain {{breaking}} antioxidants <b>scavenge</b> {{the chain}} carrying oxygen radicals and suppress the peroxidation of liposomal and biological membranes in aqueous dispersions. Vitamin E <b>scavenges</b> peroxyl radicals rapidly and its lateral diffusion is suggested to be fast, but its antioxidant efficiency in the liposomal and bio-membranes {{appears to be}} considerably smaller than in homogeneous solution. Water soluble chain breaking antioxidants, such as uric acid, cysteine, glutathione, and vitamin C, <b>scavenge</b> radicals in the aqueous region and suppress the peroxidation. However, they cannot <b>scavenge</b> the peroxyl radicals within the lipid region of the membranes. Nevertheless, vitamin C can interact with vitamin E radical, probably at membrane-water interface, and regenerate vitamin E...|$|R
5|$|Pack-hunting of langurs is {{recorded}} in India. Packs of between 5 and 18 jackals <b>scavenging</b> on the carcasses of large ungulates {{is recorded}} in India and Israel. Packs of 8–12 jackals consisting {{of more than}} one family have been observed in the summer periods in Transcaucasia. In India, the Montagu's harrier and the Pallid harrier roost in their hundreds in grasslands during their winter migration. Jackals stalk close to these roosting harriers and then rush at them, attempting to catch one before the harriers can take off or gain sufficient height to escape. In some regions of Bangladesh and India, jackals subsist by <b>scavenging</b> on carrion and garbage, and will cache extra food by burying it. Golden jackals cause damage to melon, peanut, grape, coffee, maize, and sugarcane crops. They sometimes prey on lambs, weak sheep, kids, goats, and poultry. The jackal will scavenge off the kills made by the lion, tiger, leopard, dhole, and gray wolf.|$|E
5|$|Segregation by sex {{and size}} {{does not seem}} to occur. Whitetips follow schools of tuna or squid, and trail groups of {{cetaceans}} such as dolphins and pilot whales, <b>scavenging</b> their prey. Their instinct is to follow baitfish migrations that accompany ocean-going ships. When whaling took place in warm waters, oceanic whitetips were often responsible for much of the damage to floating carcasses.|$|E
5|$|Some Cryolophosaurus bones have pathologies {{that show}} {{evidence}} of <b>scavenging.</b> Broken teeth {{from at least}} two different theropods have also been found nearby. Another possible pathology {{is found in the}} astragalus (ankle bone) of Cryolophosaurus. This bone was preserved with a small splint from the fibula located just above the ankle. The splint, however, may also be just a unique morphological feature of Cryolophosaurus.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the ability of}} ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) to <b>scavenge</b> superoxide anion (O 2 –). METHODS: We assessed the ability of UDCA to <b>scavenge</b> (O 2 –) generated by xanthine-xanthine oxidase (X-XO) in a cell-free system {{and its effect on}} the rate of O 2 –-induced ascorbic acid (AA) oxidation in hepatic post-mitochondrial supernatants. RESULTS: UDCA at a concentration as high as 1 mmol/L did not impair the ability of the X-XO system to generate O 2 –, but could <b>scavenge</b> O 2 – at concentrations of 0. 5 and 1 mmol/L, and decrease the rate of AA oxidation at a concentration of 100 µmol/L. CONCLUSION: UDCA can <b>scavenge</b> O 2 –, an action that may be beneficial to patients with primary biliary cirrhosis...|$|R

5|$|Various {{species are}} known to feed on dead {{arthropods}} (<b>scavenging),</b> web silk, and their own shed exoskeletons. Pollen caught in webs may also be eaten, and {{studies have shown that}} young spiders {{have a better chance of}} survival if they have the opportunity to eat pollen. In captivity, several spider species are also known to feed on bananas, marmalade, milk, egg yolk and sausages.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} isotope data of La Brea dire wolf fossils dated 10,000YBP {{provides}} {{evidence that the}} horse was an important prey species at the time, and that sloth, mastodon, bison, and camel were less common in the dire wolf diet. This indicates that the dire wolf was not a prey specialist, and {{at the close of}} the late Pleistocene before its extinction it was hunting or <b>scavenging</b> the most available herbivores.|$|E

5|$|Compared to {{many smaller}} Corvus species (such as American crow), ravens prefer {{undisturbed}} montane or forest habitat or rural areas over urban areas. In other areas, their numbers have increased dramatically {{and they have}} become agricultural pests. Common ravens can cause damage to crops, such as nuts and grain, or can harm livestock, particularly by killing young goat kids, lambs and calves. Ravens generally attack the faces of young livestock, but the more common raven behaviour of <b>scavenging</b> may be misidentified as predation by ranchers.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to other}} deep-sea sharks, the Izak {{catshark}} {{has a large}} heart suggestive of a relatively active lifestyle. It is a generalist that feeds {{on a wide variety}} of bony fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods; larger sharks consume proportionately more crustaceans and fewer fishes. At least some part of its recorded diet probably represents <b>scavenging</b> from fishery discards, given the presence of fast-moving, pelagic species that the shark is unlikely to have captured live. Polychaete worms, hydrozoans, gastropods, and hagfish eggs may also be occasionally ingested. This species often has nematode and flatworm parasites in its stomach.|$|E
5|$|In another {{stable isotope}} {{analysis}}, {{half of the}} Beringian wolves {{were found to be}} muskox and caribou specialists, and the other half were either horse and bison specialists or generalists. Two wolves from the full-glacial period (23,000–18,000 YBP) were found to be mammoth specialists, {{but it is not clear}} if this was due to <b>scavenging</b> or predation. The analysis of other carnivore fossils from the Fairbanks region of Alaska found that mammoth was rare in the diets of the other Beringian carnivores.|$|E

Players can avoid consuming all the valuable currency by using lower quality bullets made within the Metros. Due to the scarcity of ammunition, a crucial aspect of gameplay is <b>scavenging.</b> The player can loot corpses and the environment for spare ammunition, as well as weapons and other items. The military-grade ammunition {{can be used to}} purchase other ammunition, weapons, and items within most of the Metro stations. Weapon attachments, such as scopes and silencers, which improve weapon efficiency, can be purchased with these bullets.|$|E
5|$|Killer whales {{have also}} been {{observed}} preying on terrestrial mammals, such as deer swimming between islands off the northwest coast of North America.
