40|$|Development {{of inside}} {{diameter}} slicing technology to significantly {{increase the number}} of useable slices per inch of crystal over industry practice is discussed. The required reduction of both blade and slice thickness is to be accomplished by a combination of three key elements of slicing technology: (1) ingot rotation with minimum exposed blade area; (2) dynamic cutting edge control; and (3) the use of prefabricated insert blades. Design modifications on a <b>slicing</b> <b>saw</b> with microprocessor controls and hardware fabrication to complete this conversion were initiated. Several runs were conducted on the engineering saw incorporating the method of ingot rotation. Ingots with diameters up to six inches were sliced successfully on a production saw...|$|E
40|$|A {{large amount}} of silicon debris {{particles}} are generated during the slicing of silicon ingots into thin wafers for the fabrication of integrated-circuit chips and solar cells. This results in a significant loss of valuable materials at about 40 % {{of the mass of}} ingots. In addition, a hazardous silicon sludge waste is produced containing largely debris of silicon, and silicon carbide, which is a common cutting material on the <b>slicing</b> <b>saw.</b> Efforts in material recovery from the sludge and recycling have been largely directed towards converting silicon or silicon carbide into other chemicals. Here, we report an aerosol-assisted method to extract silicon nanoparticles from such sludge wastes and their use in lithium ion battery applications. Using an ultrasonic spray-drying method, silicon nanoparticles can be directly recovered from the mixture with high efficiency and high purity for making lithium ion battery anode. The work here demonstrated a relatively low cost approach to turn wafer slicing wastes into much higher value-added materials for energy applications, which also helps to increase the sustainability of semiconductor material and device manufacturing.

And the surface gets rougher when workpiece feed speed changes from 0. 5 m/s to 1 m/s. The machining efficiency gets higher when diamond wire <b>saw</b> <b>slicing</b> speed and workpiece feed speed increase. These results provide guidance for selecting reasonable parameters in future research...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Temperature {{variation}} of KDP crystal {{is an important}} reason for its cracking. A finite element model was constructed to analyze temperature and thermal stress distribution of KDP crystal during wire <b>saw</b> <b>slicing.</b> The {{results showed that the}} highest temperature of the crystal which was located on the sawing kerf remained stable during slicing. The temperature inside the crystal rose slowly {{at the start of the}} slicing, and then tended steady with the continued increase of sawing depth. Because of the good cooling condition during the sawing process, the overall rise in temperature was small, and the maximum thermal stress on the sawing kerf was less than the tensile strength of KDP crystal, so temperature variation during slicing had little effect on crystal cracking...|$|R

Wafer parameters such as bow, taper, and roughness {{which may not}} be important factors for solar cell fabrication, were considerably better for ID saw than those of the MBS and MWS saw. Analysis of add-on slicing cost indicated that machine productivity seems to be a major limiting factor for ID saw, while expendible material costs are a major factor for both MBS and MWS <b>saw.</b> <b>Slicing</b> experience indicated that the most important factors controling final wafer cost are: (1) silicon cost (wafer thickness + kerf loss); (2) add-on slicing cost, and (3) mechanical yield.

40|$|Silicon wafers are <b>sliced</b> using wire <b>saw</b> in micro {{electronics}} and photo voltaic industries. Wire saw process occupies a great portion of silicon wafer production cost which affects the market directly. The process {{is also used}} to cut ceramics, concrete and rocks in civil engineering. The high cost of the process motivates researchers to develop models that will relate the process efficiency and quality with process parameters. In this study, an experimental parametric study was conducted to investigate the effect of process parameters on the wire bow angle, distributed wire load and surface roughness in wire saw cutting of alumina ceramic. The material removal and surface damage formation mechanisms are identified. Process design recommendations for increasing efficiency of the process while keeping the surface roughness constant, are presented. The surface roughness increases with increasing feed rate, decreases with wire speed and is independent of wire tension. The material is removed by trans-granular failure of the grains while inter-granular fractures of the grains affect the surface quality...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{properties}} of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) in mice expressing the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) {{under the control of}} the tyrosine hydroxylase promoter (TH-GFP). By using a practical map of cell positioning in distinct SNpc and VTA subregions in horizontal midbrain <b>slices</b> we <b>saw</b> that the spontaneous firing, membrane properties, cell body size and magnitude of the hyperpolarization-activated current (Ih) in TH-GFP-positive neurons (TH-GFP+) vary significantly among subregions, following a mediolateral gradient. Block of Ih with Zd 7288 inhibited firing in the most lateral subregions, but had little effect in the intermediate/medial VTA. In addition, TH-GFP+ cells were excited by Met 5 -Enkephalin. Extracellular recordings from a large neuron number showed that all TH-GFP+ cells were inhibited by dopamine, suggesting that this is a reliable approach for identifying dopaminergic neurons in vitro. Simultaneous recordings from dopamine-sensitive and dopamine-insensitive neurons showed that dopamine-insensitive cells (putative non-dopaminergic neurons) are unaffected by Zd 7288 but inhibited by Met 5 -Enkephalin. Under patch-clamp, dopamine generated a quantitatively similar outward current in most TH-GFP+ neurons, although medial VTA cells showed reduced dopamine sensitivity. Pargyline prolonged the dopamine current, whereas cocaine enhanced dopamine-mediated responses in both the SNpc and the VTA. Our work provides new insights into the variability in mouse midbrain dopaminergic neurons along the medial-lateral axis and points to the necessity of a combination of different electrophysiological and pharmacological approaches for reliably identifying these cells to distinguish them from non-dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Astronium graveolens Jacq., also {{commonly}} known as "Gateado" or "Gateado Gal√°n," is a timber tree often used for making fine furniture, decorative <b>sliced</b> veneer, <b>sawn,</b> keels and long structures such as beams and trusses posts (1 - 2). The species are used in Brazilian folk medicine to treat allergies, inflammation, diarrhea and ulcers. Previous phytochemical studies report the presence of gallotannins as galloylglucose compounds, trans-ocimene (3) and flavonoids. In this work, we reported the isolation of known compounds as chlorogenic acid, quercitrin, quercetin 3 -O-glucoside (4) and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 -Pentagalloyl glucose (5). Studies report an interesting anti-angiogenic activity for 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 -Pentagalloyl glucose (6), we evaluated its ability to bind and inhibit the Human Placental Growth Factor (hPlGF), a key mediator of pathological angiogenesis. Materials and Methods. The leaves of Astronium graveolens collected (July 2010) at the Experimental Station "Caparo,‚Äï Barinas State, Venezuela were defatted with n-hexane and successively extracted for 48 h with chloroform and and methanol, to give 8. 5, 8. 0 and 8. 3 g of the respective residues. A portion of methanol extract (2. 5 g), was chromatographed on Sephadex LH- 20 using MeOH as eluent. A total of 106 fractions were collected (8 ml each) and combined by TLC results on silica 60 F 254 gel-coated glass sheets with n-BuOH‚ÄìAcOH‚ÄìH 2 O (60 : 15 : 25) and CHCl 3 ‚ÄìMeOH‚ÄìH 2 O (40 : 9 : 1), to give 11 pooled fractions (A‚ÄìK). The fractions more interesting were purified by RP-HPLC. The structures of isolated compounds were elucidated by 1 D- and 2 D-NMR Spectroscopy (1 H, 13 C, 13 C DEPT, DQF-COSY, HSQC, HMBC, ROESY) and confirmed by mass spectrometry studies. Competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) was used to study the interaction of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 -Pentagalloyl glucose and the h-PlGF binding to its receptor (h-VEGF-R 1 or h-Flt- 1); the concentrations are: 0, 5 mg for h-Flt- 1, 10 ng for h-PlGF, 0, 5 mg for the biotinylated antibody and 200, 100, 50, 25, 12, 5, 6, 25, 3, 12 ŒºM for the natural compound. Finally, we measured the binding affinity between 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 -Pentagalloyl glucose and h-PlGF with surface plasmon resonance assays, using Biacore technology. Results and Discussion. The phytochemical study of methanol extract led to isolation of phenolic compounds as chlorogenic acid, quercitrin, quercetin 3 -O-glucoside (4) and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 -Pentagalloyl glucose (5).

40|$|Flake tool {{is one of}} {{the stone}} tools used by Paleolithic society which used stone as their technology. It is {{produced}} by flaking the core to get the flake. The flake that been used is known as flake tools. Flake tools found in Southeast Asia is said to be amorphous, which does not have a specific shape that can describe its function. So, this made it difficult for the typology classification of flake tool. However, many Paleolithic open sites have been classified based on flake tool morphology and technology, but {{the extent to which it}} represents the function has an issue. Therefore, usewear analysis was made using a flake tool from Bukit Bunuh‚Äôs site, which is Bukit Bunuh 2010. Bukit Bunuh was a meteorite impact area then it has been the source rocks suitable to be used as a tool by the Paleolithic society. In advance, the study was conducted by classifying flake tool typology according to morphological and technological. The results of this classification showed that there are four typologies identified as serrated, notched, pointed and retouched. Serrated can be divided into concave, convex and straight. While the notched been divided according to the number of notches. Retouched typology can be divided based on their edge trimming that is, alternate, alternating, direct, bifacial and inverse. Only pointed typology does not have subdivision. After the classification, the observation of the usewear of the flake tools had been done. As a result of these observations, there are several functions of the flake tools such as <b>sawing,</b> <b>slicing,</b> whittling, drilling, scratch and multiple functions.

This work {{deals with the}} development of a methodology allowing to globally and consistently consider wood valorisation from a given forest resource. The methodology has been developed for the mostly encountered case in the Congo basin, where forest harvesting and wood processing activities are most often performed by the same company. This approach enables the integration of technical and economic specificity peculiar to each wood species and to logs quality, as weil as their consequences on productivity. Base on a well known of wood market, the competitiveness estimation of each kind of wood process by species and by production type, {{as well as in the}} specifie conditions of each project constitute a tool for decision making. This tool allows to structure the approach and simulate sorne of the strategie choices that have to be made. The proposed methodology is developing in five steps, with one or more possible feedback : The first step consists in analysing the technical consistence between the available resource and the products which can be produced : from the resource inventory (species, log quality [...] .) and from the corresponding wood properties, the type of wood products to be manufactured is deterrnined (technical requirements to be met related to intrinsic wood characteristics). The second step consists in performing a rough evaluation of the profitability of the targeted productions for each wood species. The aim is to eliminate non competitive productions and to deterrnine the processing costs of the remaining productions. The third step is a detailed estimation of the profitability by wood species and by production type. This enables the elimination of those of the species which should stay non competitive even after process optimisation. The fourth step corresponds to the use of methods for process optimisation. It is mainly based on the functional analysis concepts applied to wood processes. The fifth step allows the selection of the productions to be kept (<b>slicing,</b> peeling, softwoods <b>sawing,</b> hardwoods sawing [...] .), referring to economic and financial analysis of each type of them, completed by strategie aspects. In case of surrender of any type of production, a feedback allow to make a new evaluation ofthe allocation of the resource. The methodology is further applied to the concrete case of a 80 000 ha forest unit in eastern Cameroon. This work led to assess its operational character as a tool for decision making. Finally, the main limits and proposaIs for future research orientations are presented : absolute necessary increase in the accuracy ofresource evaluation (quantity and quality), development of a software for assistance and capitalisation, integration of recently developed methods and concepts from innovation management, from strategie decision making on marketed products, adaptation of the methodology to other types of forest sector organisation...|$|R
