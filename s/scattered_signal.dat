50|$|This {{means that}} when the emitted signal hits waves with {{wavelength}} equal to one-half of the transmitted signal, the signal that is scattered back to the antenna will be in phase.

40|$|Scatter {{contamination}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} sources of decreasing the image quality in cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). The moving blocker method is economic and effective for scatter correction (SC), which can simultaneously estimate scatter and reconstruct the complete volume within the field of view (FOV) from a single CBCT scan. However, at the regions with large intensity transition in the projection images along the axial blocker moving direction, the estimation of <b>scatter</b> <b>signal</b> from blocked regions in a single projection view can produce large error and cause significant artifacts in reconstructed images and null the usability of these regions. Furthermore, blocker edge detection error can significantly deteriorate both primary <b>signal</b> and <b>scatter</b> <b>signal</b> estimation and lead to unacceptable reconstruction results. In this study, we propose to use the adjacent multi-view projection images to jointly estimate <b>scatter</b> <b>signal</b> more accurately. In return, the more accurately estimated <b>scatter</b> <b>signal</b> can be utilized to detect blocker edges more accurately for greatly improved robustness of moving-blocker based SC. The experimental results using a Catphan phantom and an anthropomorphic pelvis phantom CBCT data show that the new method can effectively suppress the estimation errors of <b>scatter</b> <b>signal</b> in the fast signal transition regions and is able to correct the blocker detection errors. This development will expand the utility of moving-blocker based SC for the target with sharp intensity changes in the projection images and provide the needed robustness for its clinical translation...|$|R

These effects may give {{an explanation for the}} frequently observed phenomenon that polystyrene spheres reveal a relatively large CV in the perpendicular light <b>scattering</b> <b>signals,</b> whereas the CV of the forward light <b>scattering</b> <b>signal</b> is small.

30|$|In some {{applications}} of ranging and velocity detection traditional correlation {{is used to}} increase signal-to-noise ratio [3]. Some factors such as multiple scattering points and dispersion make echo waveforms seriously distorted in ultra-short pulse radars; hence, the backscattered signal from a target upon impingement of an ultra-short pulse signal has a complex shape in time domain and is completely different from the transmitted waveform [5]. In addition, the radar cross section (RCS) in UWB target detection becomes time-dependent, so the concept of instantaneous target RCS has been introduced [6]. In such cases, the target <b>scattered</b> <b>signal</b> is non-stationary in time. These phenomena cause the traditional correlation detection method, which selects the transmitted signal as the reference waveform in the correlator, to degrade in detecting targets. The parameters such as duration, location, and amplitude of the <b>scattered</b> <b>signal</b> are strongly dependent on the target geometry. Since the <b>scattered</b> <b>signal</b> from a target is represented as a stochastic time series, hence, generally speaking, its mathematical description is unknown. Therefore, blind detection has {{attracted the attention of}} advanced ultra-short pulse radar designers.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{a method}} of obtaining {{the relation between the}} singly <b>scattered</b> <b>signal</b> and the Fourier-spectrum of medium dielectric permititvity fluctuations, with due regard {{for the fact that the}} scattering volume is determined by antenna patterns and is not small.

Also, a statistical radar equation is obtained, which relates the mean statistical power of the <b>scattered</b> <b>signal</b> to the spectral density of the dielectric permitivity fluctuations without a classical approximation of the smallness of the irregularities spatial correlation radius. The work deals with the bistatic sounding case, when the exact forward and exact backward scattering are absent, and sounding signal have sufficiently norrow spectral band for scattered volume to change slowly on ranges of Fresnel radius order. The statistical radar equations obtained differs from the classical ones in the presence the coherent structures with big correlation radii, and so the received signal spectrum can differ from intrinsic spectrum of irregularities.
