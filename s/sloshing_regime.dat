40|$|We {{consider}} equivalent mechanical {{model of}} liquid sloshing in partially-filled cylindrical vessel; the model treats both {{the regime of}} linear sloshing, and strongly nonlinear <b>sloshing</b> <b>regime.</b> The latter is related to hydraulic impacts applied to the vessel walls. These hydraulic impacts are commonly simulated {{with the help of}} high-power potential and dissipation functions. For the sake of analytic exploration, we substitute this traditional approach by treatment of an idealized vibro-impact system with velocity-dependent restitution coefficient. The obtained reduced model is similar to recently explored system of linear primary oscillator with attached vibro-impact energy sink. The ratio of modal mass of the first sloshing mode to the total mass of the liquid and the tank serves as a natural small parameter for multiple-scale analysis. In the case of external ground forcing, steady-state responses and chaotic strongly modulated responses are revealed. All analytical predictions of the reduced vibro-impact model are validated against direct numerical simulations of initial equivalent model with high-power smooth potential and dissipation functions, and good agreement is observed...|$|E
40|$|In the merging-compression {{method of}} plasma start-up, two flux-ropes with {{parallel}} toroidal current are formed around in-vessel poloidal field coils, before merging {{to form a}} spherical tokamak plasma. This start-up method, used in the Mega-Ampere Spherical Tokamak (MAST), is studied as a high Lundquist number and low plasma-beta magnetic reconnection experiment. In this paper, 2 D fluid simulations are presented of this merging process {{in order to understand}} the underlying physics, and better interpret the experimental data. These simulations examine the individual and combined effects of tight-aspect ratio geometry and two-fluid physics on the merging. The ideal self-driven flux-rope dynamics are coupled to the diffusion layer physics, resulting in a large range of phenomena. For resistive MHD simulations, the flux-ropes enter the <b>sloshing</b> <b>regime</b> for normalised resistivity eta < 1 E- 5. In Hall-MHD three regimes are found for the qualitative behaviour of the current sheet, depending on the ratio of the current sheet width to the ion-sound radius. These are a stable collisional regime, an open X-point regime, and an intermediate regime that is highly unstable to tearing-type instabilities. In toroidal axisymmetric geometry, the final state after merging is a MAST-like spherical tokamak with nested flux-surfaces. It is also shown that the evolution of simulated 1 D radial density profiles closely resembles the Thomson scattering electron density measurements in MAST. An intuitive explanation for the origin of the measured density structures is proposed, based upon the results of the toroidal Hall-MHD simulations. Comment: 12 pages, 12 figures.

40|$|In this paper, {{we apply}} {{computational}} fluid dynamics (CFD) to study the thermodynamic response enhanced by sloshing inside liquefied natural gas (LNG) fuel tanks. An existing numerical solver provided by OpenFOAM is used to simulate sloshing in a model scaled tank of similar form to an LNG fuel tank. The interface area has been estimated for different <b>sloshing</b> <b>regimes</b> on three different numerical grids representing the tank in 3 D. Estimating the interface area is done by performing a grid-independence study. In the most severe sloshing conditions, convergence is not achieved. By combining the results from experiments and CFD, {{it is found that}} the interface area and the condensation mass flow rate are in phase for the most severe sloshing condition. The existing CFD solver is modified to determine the pressure drop. The simulation results are compared to the experimental data, and the results are acceptable and thereby show a potential in applying CFD to predict the thermodynamic response due to sloshing. By plotting the temperature contours, indications are found that the exchange of cold bulk and saturated liquid due to sloshing has a significant influence on the thermodynamic response...|$|R
40|$|Liquid {{propellant}} slosh {{is often}} {{a concern for the}} controllability of flight vehicles. Anti-slosh devices are traditionally included in propellant tank designs to limit the amount of sloshing allowed during flight. These devices and any necessary supports can be quite heavy to meet various structural requirements. Some of the burden on anti-slosh devices can be relieved by exploiting the nonlinear behavior of slosh waves in bare smooth wall tanks. A nonlinear <b>regime</b> <b>slosh</b> model for bare spherical tanks was developed through a joint analytical and experimental effort by NASA/MSFC. The developed slosh model accounts for the large damping inherent in nonlinear slosh waves which is more accurate and drives conservatism from vehicle stability analyses that use traditional bare tank slosh models. A more accurate slosh model will result in more realistic predicted slosh forces during flight reducing or removing the need for active controls during a maneuver or baffles in the tank design. Lower control gains and smaller or fewer tank baffles can reduce cost and system complexity while increasing vehicle performance. Both Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation and slosh testing of three different spherical tank geometries were performed to develop the proposed slosh model. Several important findings were made during this effort in addition to determining the parameters to the nonlinear <b>regime</b> <b>slosh</b> model. The linear <b>regime</b> <b>slosh</b> damping trend for spherical tanks reported in NASA SP- 106 was shown to be inaccurate for certain regions of a tank. Additionally, transition to the nonlinear regime for spherical tanks was only found to occur at very large wave amplitudes in the lower hemisphere and was a strong function of the propellant fill level in the upper hemisphere. The nonlinear regime damping trend was also found to be a function of the propellant fill level...|$|R
