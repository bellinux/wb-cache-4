50|$|From 1937 to 1942, Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) Company 1823(CV), an {{experienced}} company of African American World War I veterans, made initial {{improvements to the}} site, including construction of the combination building, the boat house, and the dam and spillway creating Lake Raven. The company also had to clear the future lake bed of standing timber before filling the lake. Other CCC projects in the park included a <b>swimming</b> <b>platform,</b> stone culverts, picnic areas, Lakeshore Road, a bridge, stone road-curbing, a well, water intake structure, and frame pump house. The spillway gave way after a 1940 flood and Lake Raven drained. This scuttled {{plans to build a}} bath house and cabins.|$|R
50|$|Its ecology has {{suffered}} recent hurricane damage. The <b>swim</b> <b>platform</b> at Camp Sawyer which was rebuilt after a 2004 storm became, in turn, scrap lumber in 2005.

As a result of the long options list, no two boats outside the charter fleets were built in the same configuration.|$|E
5000|$|Le Grand Bleu {{is one of}} {{the largest}} private yachts in the world at 113 m in length. She was built at the Bremer Vulkan yard in Bremen, Germany, and was {{launched}} in 2000. She was designed by Stefano Pastrovich and constructed by Kusch Yachts. She was previously owned by John McCaw, Jr., an American businessman, who sold her to Russian businessman Roman Abramovich in 2002. Abramovich had her refitted to his own preferences by HDW in Kiel, Germany. This included an internal refit and the addition of a 5 m <b>swim</b> <b>platform.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 2012, Ron Huibers joined Volvo Penta {{after twenty}} years {{of working with the}} Volvo Group in trucks, {{construction}} and finance. In his role at Volvo Penta, he also has global responsibility for the marine gas segment. Based on his analysis of industry trends and his boating experience, he proposed the idea of a sterndrive with forward-facing propellers, a similar technical solution to the one pioneered by Volvo Penta with the IPS that was introduced ten years ago. With forward-facing propellers tucked under the boat away from the <b>swimming</b> <b>platform,</b> the drive would allow Volvo Penta’s customers to build boats for the growing watersports market.|$|R

50|$|For a few decades, Ryde had {{a second}} pier, the Victoria, {{a few hundred yards}} to the east. It was {{promoted}} by the Stokes Bay Pier and Railway Company to provide a landing for a rival ferry service from Gosport. It opened in 1864 as the main pier was getting its tramway. Being somewhat shorter than Ryde Pier, it could not be used at all points of the tide, and so offered little competition to the main Ryde to Portsmouth ferry services. When the Stokes Bay company was acquired by the London & South Western Railway in 1875, the ferry service ceased, and Victoria Pier became a pleasure pier only, with public baths at the head and a <b>swimming</b> <b>platform</b> at the dry end.|$|R

40|$|Under an interagency {{agreement}} with the United States Coast Guard, working in collaboration with an industry consultant, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) researchers evaluated carbon monoxide (CO) exposures on ten express cruiser boats from several manufacturers. The evaluated boats were new and included several different models. These boats had gasoline-powered propulsion engines and used gasoline-powered generators to provide electricity for onboard appliances. This study was performed for the U. S. Coast Guard to better understand how CO poisonings may occur on express cruisers, identify the most hazardous conditions, and {{begin the process of}} identify controls to prevent/reduce CO exposures. Boats were evaluated while stationary and at multiple speeds, ranging from 5 to 25 miles per hour. CO concentrations were measured by multiple real-time instruments, which were placed at different locations on the boats with overhead, enclosing canopies set at various configurations. Many of the evaluated boats generated hazardous CO concentrations: peak CO concentrations often exceeded 1, 100 parts per million (ppm), while average CO concentrations were well over 100 ppm at the stern (rear). Two boats with a combined exhaust system (exhausting at the sides and underwater) had dramatically lower CO concentrations {{than any of the other}} evaluated boats (about 40 % lower). Based on the results and observations made in this report, the following major findings are summarized below: 1. When the canvas is deployed and boat is underway, CO concentrations exceeded the immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) level near the <b>swim</b> <b>platform</b> for many of the evaluated boats. 2. The combination of travel at low speeds into the wind with the canvas fully deployed and no forward hatches, windows or front panels opened maximized the station wagon effect, pulling significant amounts of CO into the cockpit. 3. Different exhaust configurations have a major impact on how CO concentrations are entrained into the cockpit and other occupied areas. Accordingly, boats equipped with underwater exhaust exhibited significantly lower CO concentrations than vessels equipped with other exhaust designs. 4. CO concentrations are typically higher at the stern of the boat and become gradually lower toward the front of the boat. 5. Stationary smoke tests in the engine compartment showed satisfactory sealing of the bulkhead between the engine and adjacent compartments on all boats. Based on the preceding findings, the following recommendations are made to reduce CO concentrations on express cruisers: 1. Boat manufacturers should consider underwater exhaust that will significantly reduce CO concentrations inside the cockpit and other occupied areas compared to surface exhaust. 2. Because of the station wagon effect, some canvas configurations should not be used while boat is moving or propulsion and/or generator engines are running. 3. The possibility of adding force draft blowers into the cabin, creating a positive pressure to minimize potential CO intrusions, should be studied. Auxiliary blowers can be fitted and routed to ventilate the cockpit and <b>swim</b> <b>platform</b> areas in order to minimize negative pressure areas throughout the vessel. 4. Since properly sealed cabin doors directly influenced the CO concentration in the cabin area, door suppliers should be encouraged to develop better sealing methods and designs. 5. Windshield manufacturers should be encouraged to study the possibility of maximizing ventilation of occupied areas by improving the design of the center and side wings of the windshield. 7. Due care should be exercised when designing the powered ventilation system on the engine compartment, locating the air intake on the opposite side of the generator exhaust. Also, potentially moving the intake much farther forward on the vessel would help minimize the intake of CO exhaust into the engine compartment. 8. The development of cleaner burning engines (propulsion and generators) with catalytic converters should continue since they have the potential to greatly reduce CO concentrations to safer levels. 9. The American Boat and Yacht Council (ABYC) should examine their standards and emphasize ventilation problems that can lead to CO intrusions, taking a strong position against surface exhaust designs for propulsion engines.
