40|$|Jean Sgard : The <b>salary</b> <b>scale.</b> The <b>salary</b> <b>scale</b> in France between 1726 and 1789 {{differs from}} 1 to 1000, if princely {{fortunes}} are excluded.

The aim is to identify the perception of employees concerning OC that they have perceived at their workplace and, how gender, education level and range of salary affect them. The data have been collected through sets of questionnare answered by 624 respondents who are hotel employees in Malaysia. The dimensions of OC which are affective, continuance and normative have been analysed using exploratory factor analysis (EFA). The data then been analysed using t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) to find the significance differences between gender, level of education and <b>salary</b> <b>scale</b> with the three dimensions of OC. The result of this study reveals that there is no significant diffrences between three dimensions of OC and gender. Findings also show that there are significant differences between education level and three dimensions of OC. Similarly, the results also display significant differences between <b>salary</b> <b>scale</b> and, affective and continuance commitment but not with normative comitment. Managerial implications, limitations and future research directions are also discussed.    ...|$|R

50|$|In the MENA region, {{teachers}} are not selected for their competence, creativity, and teaching performance. Rather, they are identified {{by virtue of their}} educational attainment. However, <b>salary</b> <b>scales</b> do not differ between teachers at different levels of experience. This very fact has discouraged proactive improvement of teaching and subsequently has reduced the quality of teaching in general.An effective solution to such a challenge would be to introduce continuing evaluations and examinations in order to assess teachers' performance in the classroom. Instructors who succeed in these evaluative examinations may move to a higher salary scale. This process would not only motivate teachers to perform but would positively influence the quality of education in general.|$|E
50|$|Numerous {{measures}} were introduced which extended pre-school services and supported local voluntary organisations.

The subsidy for building play-centres and kindergartens was doubled and provision was made for helping in the purchase of sites. New <b>salary</b> <b>scales</b> for kindergarten teachers were approved, and assistance was extended to day-care centres, with the government providing a grant of $4.50 per week for each child cared for in an approved centre, which also qualified for a two-thirds subsidy on construction costs. In 1972, 1 in 3 children received pre-school education, while in 1975, the equivalent figure was 2 in 3.|$|E

[...] This initiative developed through a partnership and grant with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. [...] The early phases of this new initiative rolled out in 2010 when teachers observation evaluation form was radically redeveloped into a complex rubric with four overall areas of focus—Planning and Preparation, Classroom Environment, Instruction, and Professional Responsibilities—each with multiple, specific sub points. Each point has four possible categories—Requires Action, Progressing, Accomplished, and Exemplary—in which the teacher can fall.|$|E
