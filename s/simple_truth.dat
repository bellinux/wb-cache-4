25|$|When Saddam Hussein {{suppressed}} Kurdish uprisings in 1991, Archer, {{with the}} Red Cross, {{set up the}} charity <b>Simple</b> <b>Truth,</b> a fundraising campaign {{on behalf of the}} Kurds. In May 1991, Archer organised a charity pop concert, starring Rod Stewart, Paul Simon, Sting and Gloria Estefan, who all performed for free. Archer claimed that his charity had raised £57,042,000, though it was later revealed that only £3 million came from the <b>Simple</b> <b>Truth</b> concert and appeal, the rest from aid projects sponsored by the British and other governments, with significant amounts pledged before the concert. The charity would later result in further controversy. Having been previously rejected, Archer was made a life peer on 27 July 1992 as Baron Archer of Weston-super-Mare, of Mark in the County of Somerset. Prime Minister John Major recommended him largely because of Archer's role in aid to the Kurds. Archer and Major had been friends for a number of years.|$|E
25|$|Given {{the same}} level playing field one {{group of people who}} treat each other well will create a {{pleasant}} environment. Whereas another group of people, given exactly the same tools to work with, can create unpleasant conditions simply by how they treat each other. Writer Dawn Eden suggests that this is a <b>simple</b> <b>truth</b> which can be easily forgotten by lonely people unable to see their situation clearly. She argues that such situations can be improved by reaching out to others.|$|E
25|$|It was {{traditionally}} thought (especially by the Aristotelians) {{that the}} air did not have lateral weight: that is, that the kilometers of air above the surface did not exert any weight on the bodies below it. Even Galileo had accepted the weightlessness of air as a <b>simple</b> <b>truth.</b> Torricelli questioned that assumption, and instead proposed that air had weight {{and that it was}} the latter (not the attracting force of the vacuum) which held (or rather, pushed) up the column of water. He thought that the level the water stayed at (c. 10.3m) was reflective of the force of the air's weight pushing on it (specifically, pushing on the water in the basin and thus limiting how much water can fall from the tube into it). In other words, he viewed the barometer as a balance, an instrument for measurement (as opposed to merely being an instrument to create a vacuum), and because {{he was the first to}} view it this way, he is traditionally considered the inventor of the barometer (in the sense in which we now use the term).|$|E

500|$|Keynes had {{completed}} his A Treatise on Probability before the war, but published it in 1921. The work was a notable {{contribution to the}} philosophical and mathematical underpinnings of probability theory, championing the important view that probabilities were no {{more or less than}} truth values intermediate between <b>simple</b> <b>truth</b> and falsity. Keynes developed the first upper-lower probabilistic interval approach to probability in chapters 15 and 17 of this book, as well as having developed the first decision weight approach with his conventional coefficient of risk and weight, c, in chapter 26. In addition to his academic work, the 1920s saw Keynes active as a journalist selling his work internationally and working in London as a financial consultant. In 1924 Keynes wrote an obituary for his former tutor ...|$|E
500|$|For Santopietro, Sinatra was the {{personification}} of America in the 1950s: [...] "cocky, eye on the main chance, optimistic, and full {{of the sense of}} possibility". Barbara Sinatra wrote that [...] "A big part of Frank's thrill was the sense of danger that he exuded, an underlying, ever-present tension only those closest to him knew could be defused with humor". [...] Cary Grant, a good friend of Sinatra's, stated that Sinatra was the [...] "most honest person he'd ever met", who spoke [...] "a <b>simple</b> <b>truth,</b> without artifice which scared people", and was often moved to tears by his performances. [...] Jo-Caroll Dennison commented that he possessed [...] "great inner strength", and that his energy and drive was [...] "enormous". A workaholic, he reportedly only slept for four hours a night on average. Throughout his life, Sinatra had mood swings and bouts of mild to severe depression, admitting to an interviewer in the 1950s that [...] "I have an over-acute capacity for sadness as well as elation". Barbara Sinatra stated that he would [...] "snap at anyone for the slightest misdemeanor", while Van Heusen said that when Sinatra got drunk it was [...] "best to disappear".|$|E

2500|$|Every Heyting algebra whose set of non-greatest {{elements}} has a greatest element (and forms another Heyting algebra) is subdirectly irreducible, whence every Heyting algebra {{can be made}} an SI by adjoining a new greatest element. [...] It {{follows that}} even among the finite Heyting algebras there exist infinitely many that are subdirectly irreducible, no two of which have the same equational theory. [...] Hence no finite set of finite Heyting algebras can supply all the counterexamples to non-laws of Heyting algebra. [...] This is {{in sharp contrast to}} Boolean algebras, whose only SI is the two-element one, which on its own therefore suffices for all counterexamples to non-laws of Boolean algebra, the basis for the <b>simple</b> <b>truth</b> table decision method. [...] Nevertheless, it is decidable whether an equation holds of all Heyting algebras.|$|E
2500|$|As the 1970s wore on, Nicholson became {{increasingly}} disillusioned with football, {{in particular the}} increased player wages and the endemic hooliganism. He was appalled by the hooliganism he witnessed at the UEFA Cup final that Spurs lost to Feyenoord. Nicholson decided to resigned after a poor start to the 197475 season and losing 4–0 to Middlesbrough in the League Cup in September 1974. Nicholson later said of his resignation: [...] "The <b>simple</b> <b>truth</b> was that I was burned out, I had no more to offer." [...] His tenure ended in acrimony as Nicholson wished to select for his replacement Danny Blanchflower as manager and Johnny Giles as player-coach, but Spurs chairman Sidney Wale was angered that Nicholson had contacted Giles and Blanchflower without his knowledge. Although Nicholson had intended {{to stay at the}} club as an advisor, the club chose to severe all ties with a £10,000 payoff and refused Nicholson a testimonial.|$|E

He narrated and was co-executive {{producer}} of the 2007 documentary Sand and Sorrow. Clooney also appeared in the documentary film Darfur Now, a call-to-action film released in November 2007 for {{people all over the world}} to help stop the Darfur crisis. In December 2007, Clooney and fellow actor Don Cheadle received the Summit Peace Award from the Nobel Peace Prize Laureates in Rome. In his acceptance speech, Clooney said that [...] "Don and I … stand here before you as failures. The <b>simple</b> <b>truth</b> is that when it comes to the atrocities in Darfur … those people are not better off now than they were years ago." [...] On January 18, 2008, the United Nations announced Clooney's appointment as a UN messenger of peace, effective January 31.|$|E
2500|$|Addams damned {{war as a}} cataclysm that {{undermined}} human kindness, solidarity, civic friendship, {{and caused}} families across the world to struggle. In turn her views were denounced by patriotic groups and newspapers during World War I (1917–18). Oswald Garrison Villard came to her defense when she suggested that armies gave liquor to soldiers just before major ground attacks. [...] "Take the case of Jane Addams for one. With what abuse did not the [...] Times cover her, one of the noblest of our women, because she told the <b>simple</b> <b>truth</b> that the Allied troops were often given liquor or drugs before charging across No Man's Land. Yet when the facts came out {{at the hands of}} Sir Philip Gibbs and others not one word of apology was ever forthcoming." [...] Even after the war the WILPF's program of peace and disarmament was characterized by opponents as radical, Communist-influenced, unpatriotic, and unfeminine. Young veterans in the American Legion, supported by some members of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) and the League of Women Voters, were ill-prepared to confront the older, better-educated, more financially secure and nationally famous women of the WILPF. Nevertheless, the DAR could and did expel Addams from membership in their organization. The Legion's efforts to portray the WILPF members as dangerously naive females resonated with working class audiences, but President Calvin Coolidge and the middle classes supported Addams and her WILPF efforts in the 1920s to prohibit poison gas and outlaw war. After 1920, however, she was widely regarded as the greatest woman of the Progressive Era. In 1931 the award of the Nobel Peace prize earned her near-unanimous acclaim.|$|E
