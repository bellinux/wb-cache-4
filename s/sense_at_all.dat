40|$|Between {{sensing the}} world after every action (as in a {{reactive}} plan) and not <b>sensing</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> (as in an openloop plan), lies a continuum of strategies for sensing during plan execution. If sensing incurs a cost (in time or resources), the most cost-effective strategy is likely to fall somewhere between these two extremes. Yet most work on plan execution assumes one or the other. In this paper, an efficient, anytime planner is described that controls the rate of sensing during plan execution. The sensing interval {{is determined by the}} state during plan execution, {{as well as by the}} cost of sensing, so that an agent can sense more often when necessary.

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we explore the use of {{stochastic}} approaches for opportunistic access based on models of primary user activity. We focus in particular on a scenario where the secondary user does not perform traditional <b>sensing</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> but relies only on statistical information of primary transmissions. Using techniques from the theory of alternating renewal processes we show that, for different primary user constraints, simple sta-tistical transmission schemes exist based on selecting sufficiently low transmission probability for the secondary user. We describe the general framework for deriving the required results, and give a detailed case study assuming that the primary transmitter activity patterns follow exponential distributions. The results for the exponential case show that limited but stable capacity {{can be achieved by}} the secondary user for any primary activity level. We also discuss the possible usage scenarios for such statistical approaches, focusing on situations in which traditional sensing is challenging due to high level of dynamics in the environment.

40|$|Abstract Context:  Compressive {{spectral}} imaging systems (CSI) use a {{focal plane}} array (FPA) to measure two-dimensional (2 D) coded projections of a three-dimensional (3 D) spatiospectral scene. A reconstruction algorithm based on compressive sensing theory exploits the projections to retrieve the underlying 3 D scene. Compressive sensing relies on two principles: Sparsity and incoherence. Higher incoherence drives to better-reconstructed image quality. In CSI systems, a random design of the coded apertures elements guarantees a high incoherence between the sensing matrix and the representation basis. However, when a coded aperture is designed completely random, {{it is possible that}} some voxels not be <b>sensed</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> or they be sensed more than once. Method: This paper presents a random algorithm for a colored coded apertures design by homogenizing defined parameters of the colored coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging system (C-CASSI) representative matrix. Homogenization parameters guarantee that <b>all</b> voxels are <b>sensed</b> <b>at</b> least once. The homogenization is achieved by weighting the selected parameters of the matrix, in this case, the average of unblocking elements per column and the average of unblocking elements per row. Results/Conclusions: Simulations show a higher performance in the PSNR of the reconstructed images by using the proposed approach, as compared to traditional random coded apertures...|$|R
40|$|Rapid and {{accurate}} detection and identification of biological agents is an objective of various national security programs. Detection {{in general is}} difficult owing to natural clutter and anticipated low concentrations of subject material. Typical detection architectures comprise a nonspecific trigger, a rapid identifier, and a confirming step, often in a laboratory. High-confidence identification must be made prior to taking action, though this must be traded against regrets stemming from delay. Sensing requirements are best established by positing plausible scenarios, {{two of which are}} suggested herein. Modern technologies include the use of elastic scatter and ultraviolet laser-induced fluorescence for triggering and standoff detection. Optical and nonoptical techniques are used routinely in analyzing clinical samples used to confirm infection and illness resulting from a biological attack.

2500|$|Frequently, what {{is called}} [...] "wood collage art" [...] uses only natural wood - such as driftwood, or parts of found and {{unaltered}} logs, branches, sticks, or bark. This {{raises the question of}} whether such artwork is collage (in the original <b>sense)</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> (see Collage and modernism). This is because the early, paper collages were generally made from bits of text or pictures - things originally made by people, and functioning or signifying in some cultural context. The collage brings these still-recognizable [...] "signifiers" [...] (or fragments of signifiers) together, in a kind of semiotic collision. A truncated wooden chair or staircase newel used in a Nevelson work can also be considered a potential element of collage in the same sense: it had some original, culturally determined context. Unaltered, natural wood, such as one might find on a forest floor, arguably has no such context; therefore, the characteristic contextual disruptions associated with the collage idea, as it originated with Braque and Picasso, cannot really take place. (Driftwood is of course sometimes ambiguous: while a piece of driftwood may once have been a piece of worked wood - for example, part of a ship - it may be so weathered by salt and sea that its past functional identity is nearly or completely obscured.) ...|$|E
