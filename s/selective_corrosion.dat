50|$|Selective leaching, {{also called}} dealloying, demetalification, parting and <b>selective</b> <b>{{corrosion}},</b> is a corrosion type in some solid solution alloys, when in suitable conditions {{a component of}} the alloys is preferentially leached from the material. The less noble metal is removed from the alloy by a microscopic-scale galvanic corrosion mechanism. The most susceptible alloys are the ones containing metals with high distance between each other in the galvanic series, e.g. copper and zinc in brass. The elements most typically undergoing selective removal are zinc, aluminium, iron, cobalt, chromium, and others.|$|E
40|$|The Ag-AgCl micro-reference {{electrodes}} were fabricated {{and used}} to determine the potentials of ferrite and austenite in duplex stainless steel in NaCl solutions separately. The result shows that ferrite has lower corrosion potential than that of austenite. To determine the corrosion behavior for the single phases accurately and obtain more information about the <b>selective</b> <b>corrosion,</b> a capillary-based micro electrochemical system was established. The electrochemical determinations of ferrite and austenite were performed respectively in solutions containing nitric acid and FeCl 3. According to the results, ferrite has more noble corrosion potential and low current density in 1. 5 mol/L HNO 3 and 1. 5 mol/L HNO 3 + 0. 5 mol/L FeCl 3 solutions, thus <b>selective</b> <b>corrosion</b> occurred in austenite phase, while, in 1. 5 mol/L HNO 3 + 0. 1 mol/L FeCl 3 solutions, the potential differences between two phases are not obvious, which result in little <b>selective</b> <b>corrosion...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{deterioration}} of metallic materials by {{the activities of}} various microorganisms (microbes), {{hereinafter referred to as}} microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC), is a ubiquitous problem that occurs in freshwater, brackish water, and seawater environments. MIC can have a wide range of short-term to long-term, deleterious effects on water wells; these include, but are not limited to, dramatically reducing the useful life of water well casing and screen, and causing a marked increase in the cost to operate a well due to its effects (e. g., lowered specific capacity, reduced well efficiency, and higher power consumption). MIC can result in pitting, crevice <b>corrosion,</b> <b>selective</b> dealloying, stress <b>corrosion</b> cracking, and under-deposit corrosion. MIC is an interesting and complex topic that {{has been the subject of}} many studies regarding its occurrence, treatment, and effects.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper the {{relationship}} between stress corrosion cracking (SCC) and corrosion behaviors of Al-Zn-Mg 7 NO 1 alloy in NaCl solutions was investigated metallurgically and electro chemically. For lower temperature (below 60 ℃) -and shorter time-aged (ie. cold aged) alloys, the susceptibilities to SCC and intergranular corrosion were in a good correlation, and {{the values of the}} observed activation energy of SCC and dissolution were equal approximately. The SCC is essentially caused by active-path corrosion of pre-existed anodic zone along grain boundaries. For higher temperature-and longer time-aged (ie. warm aged) alloys, the contribution of corrosion actions to SCC process was relatively small. The crack growth involved a mechanical rupture process. For high temperature (above 85 ℃) -and shorter time-aged alloys, the SCC was assisted by easy crack initiation due to highly <b>selective</b> exfoliation <b>corrosion...</b>|$|R

The micro-chemical results obtained from these areas have revealed that the mirror surface was tin enriched via inverse-segregation phenomenon by tailoring the cooling parameters.

40|$|Speleogenesis {{of narrow}} and {{relatively}} deep karst shafts (avens) was {{studied in the}} Slovak part of the Dolný Vrch Plateau (the Slovak Karst Biosphere Reserve, SE Slovakia). Most of the 211 shafts and shaft-related depressions located on the plateau have similar characteristics and no shaft has a known accessible connection to an active horizontal cave system. Dominant tectonic fractures are sub-vertical (sloping 70 - 90 °) {{in most of the}} shafts. Several microforms, e. g. scallop-like forms, wall troughs or networks of protruding veins, evidence the main speleogenetic processes.

40|$|Many basic {{aspects of}} surface {{treatment}} with Excimer laser radiation {{have been investigated}} {{and it has been}} shown that the processing results are affected by variations of the processing variables as well as by irregularities of the workpiece. Therefore the development of on-line process control systems is of great importance for an increase in reproducibility and further acceptance of Excimer laser processing in production line. To ensure high machining quality and short machining time the processing result and all significant processing parameters has to be analyzed and controlled in realtime. One promising technique of surface treatment is scale removal to improve the corrosion resistance of austenitic steel. For this application the varying thickness and composition of the scale layer require an adaption of the processing parameters (fluence and number of laser pulses per site) to the local surface conditions. A process diagnosis based on Plasma Emission Spectroscopy (PES) is build up for this application. Another application of interest is <b>selective</b> removal of <b>corrosion</b> layers on historical glass paintings to increase light transmission.

40|$|Inspection of {{non-ferrous}} {{cast material}} is routinely carried {{out looking for}} casting defects inherent for the manufacturing process. The NDT methods employed are Radiography and Ultrasonics, primarily for sub-surface or internal defects and Penetrants fo r surface breaking defects. Electromagnetic techniques have not been used on cast material except maybe for conductivity determination. This limitation resulting fi 7 om the surface roughness normally associated with cast surfaces and the fact the other techniques mention above have been very successful in finding and evaluating the discontinuities sought. The possible application of Electromagnetic techniques on surfaces in the as-cast condition of non-ferromagnetic material came about because of specific problems experienced by industry. Two major investigations were offered namely; 1) Investigation of CNC material - CuNiCr [1. 6 %Cr] castings exhibiting oxide entrapment {{in the form of}} networks. 2) Investigation of NAB - Nickel Aluminium Bronze exhibiting selective phase corrosion on immersion in seawater. The detection and measurement of both oxide entrapment and phase <b>selective</b> <b>corrosion</b> was difficult and in cases impossible with conventional NDT methods employed for quality control of these material/component types. Time of Flight DiMaction Ultrasonics did give some 50 % detectability of phase <b>selective</b> <b>corrosion,</b> but the method was found to be expensive and very time consuming. The metallurgical properties of the material and morphology of the defects have been studied for both Cupro Nickel Chromium and Nickel Aluminium Bronze cast alloys. An investigation was then conducted to study the effects of eddy current signals and their potential in detecting, both linear and cluster type defects which were predominantly interdendritic with some reported as intergranular in nature. For inspecting Cupro Nickel Chromium castings two successful eddy current methods have been developed. Detection of surface flaws was achieved by high frequency [2 MHzj examination and subsurface flaws by using low frequencies [1 [...] 'IKHz] but using specifically developed sensors that provided good penetration but maintained sensitivity to the fine defects. In the case of Nickel Aluminium Bronze material, the investigation was to look at electromagnetic techniques, which best utilizes the inherent feature of permeability/conductivity associated with this non- ferromagnetic material and any changes that phase <b>selective</b> <b>corrosion</b> may produce. Some meaningful results were obtained using a combination of edd'y current excitation with detection via magneto -re s istive sensors. Testing through 30 - 40 mm of material to detect small magnetic variation produced by only 1 - 2 mm of corrosion penetration was difficult to quantify. Detection and assessment however appeared hopeful when examination was carried out from the corroded surface.
