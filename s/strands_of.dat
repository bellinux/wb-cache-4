5|$|DNA stores {{biological}} information. The DNA backbone is {{resistant to}} cleavage, and both <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> the double-stranded structure store the same biological information. This information is replicated as {{and when the}} two strands separate. A large part of DNA (more than 98% for humans) is non-coding, meaning that these sections do not serve as patterns for protein sequences.|$|E

50|$|Prior to cell division, the DNA {{material}} in the original cell must be duplicated so that after cell division, each new cell contains the full amount of DNA material. The process of DNA duplication is usually called replication. The replication is termed semiconservative since each new cell contains one <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> original DNA and one newly synthesized <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> DNA. The original polynucleotide <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> DNA serves as a template to guide the synthesis of the new complementary polynucleotide of DNA. The DNA single strand template serves to guide the synthesis <b>of</b> a complementary <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> DNA.|$|R

50|$|A {{nicking enzyme}} (or nicking endonuclease) is an enzyme that cuts one <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> a {{double-stranded}} DNA {{at a specific}} recognition nucleotide sequences known as a restriction site.

5|$|A few insects, such {{as members}} of the {{families}} Poduridae and Onychiuridae (Collembola), Mycetophilidae (Diptera) and the beetle families Lampyridae, Phengodidae, Elateridae and Staphylinidae are bioluminescent. The most familiar group are the fireflies, beetles of the family Lampyridae. Some species are able to control this light generation to produce flashes. The function varies with some species using them to attract mates, while others use them to lure prey. Cave dwelling larvae of Arachnocampa (Mycetophilidae, fungus gnats) glow to lure small flying insects into sticky <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> silk.|$|E
5|$|Among animals, {{there exists}} a single known example of an {{apparently}} freely-rotating structure, though it is used for digestion rather than propulsion: the crystalline style of certain bivalves and gastropods. The style consists of a transparent glycoprotein rod which is continuously formed in a cilia-lined sac and extends into the stomach. The cilia rotate the rod, so that it becomes wrapped in <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> mucus. As the rod slowly dissolves in the stomach, it releases digestive enzymes. Estimates {{of the speed of}} rotation of the style in vivo vary significantly, and it is unclear if the style is rotated continuously or intermittently.|$|E
5|$|As a result, it is {{both the}} {{percentage}} of GC base pairs and the overall length of a DNA double helix that determines {{the strength of the}} association between the two <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> DNA. Long DNA helices with a high GC-content have stronger-interacting strands, while short helices with high AT content have weaker-interacting strands. In biology, parts of the DNA double helix that need to separate easily, such as the TATAAT Pribnow box in some promoters, tend to have a high AT content, making the strands easier to pull apart.|$|E
40|$|The {{program of}} {{transcription}} in phage gh- 1 -infected Pseudomonas putida was examined. It {{was found that}} the host P. putida RNA polymerase transcribes early RNA from the L <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> gh- 1 DNA during the initial stages of infection. The host RNA polymerase is also undoubtedly responsible for transcription of complementary RNA late in the infectious cycle because complementary RNA was not transcribed when rifampin was added to the infected cell culture. The gh- 1 -induced RNA polymerase transcribes late RNA from the L <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> gh- 1 DNA late in the infectious cycle. The P. putida RNA polymerase transcribed only early RNA from primarily the L <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> gh- 1 DNA in vitro when the molar ratio of enzyme to gh- 1 DNA was 0. 5. When the molar ratio was 50 the P. putida RNA polymerase transcribed RNA from the H <b>strand</b> <b>of</b> gh- 1 DNA as well as complementary RNA.

5|$|Drugs {{also are}} used to inhibit enzymes needed for the {{survival}} of pathogens. For example, bacteria are surrounded by a thick cell wall made of a net-like polymer called peptidoglycan. Many antibiotics such as penicillin and vancomycin inhibit the enzymes that produce and then cross-link the <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> this polymer together. This causes the cell wall to lose strength and the bacteria to burst. In the figure, a molecule of penicillin (shown in a ball-and-stick form) is shown bound to its target, the transpeptidase from the bacteria Streptomyces R61 (the protein is shown as a ribbon-diagram).|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} pentose residues of the bases, DNA strands have directionality. One end of a DNA polymer contains an exposed hydroxyl group on the deoxyribose; {{this is known as}} the 3'end of the molecule. The other end contains an exposed phosphate group; this is the 5'end. The two <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> a double-helix run in opposite directions. Nucleic acid synthesis, including DNA replication and transcription occurs in the 5'→3'direction, because new nucleotides are added via a dehydration reaction that uses the exposed 3'hydroxyl as a nucleophile.|$|E

5|$|In DNA, fraying {{occurs when}} non-complementary regions exist {{at the end}} of an {{otherwise}} complementary double-strand of DNA. However, branched DNA can occur if a third strand of DNA is introduced and contains adjoining regions able to hybridize with the frayed regions of the pre-existing double-strand. Although the simplest example of branched DNA involves only three <b>strands</b> <b>of</b> DNA, complexes involving additional strands and multiple branches are also possible. Branched DNA can be used in nanotechnology to construct geometric shapes, see the section on uses in technology below.|$|E
