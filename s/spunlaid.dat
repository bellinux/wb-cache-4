5000|$|Spunbond {{has been}} {{combined}} with melt-blown nonwovens, conforming {{them into a}} layered product called SMS (spun-melt-spun). Melt-blown nonwovens have extremely fine fiber diameters but are not strong fabrics. SMS fabrics, made completely from PP are water-repellent and fine enough to serve as disposable fabrics. Melt-blown is often used as filter media, being able to capture very fine particles. <b>Spunlaid</b> is bonded by either resin or thermally. Regarding the bonding of <b>Spunlaid,</b> Rieter [...] has launched {{a new generation of}} nonwovens called Spunjet. In fact, Spunjet is the bonding of the <b>Spunlaid</b> filaments thanks to the hydroentanglement.|$|E
5000|$|Both staple and <b>spunlaid</b> {{nonwovens}} {{would have}} no mechanical resistance in and of themselves, without the bonding step. Several methods can be used: ...|$|E
5000|$|... {{calendering}} through heated rollers (called spunbond {{when combined}} with <b>spunlaid</b> webs), calenders can be smooth faced for an overall bond or patterned for a softer, more tear resistant bond ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Spunlaid,</b> {{also called}} spunbond, {{nonwovens}} {{are made in}} one continuous process. Fibers are spun and then directly dispersed into a web by deflectors or can be directed with air streams. This technique leads to faster belt speeds, and cheaper costs. Several variants of this concept are available, such as the REICOFIL machinery. PP spunbonds run faster and at lower temperatures than PET spunbonds, mostly due to the difference in melting points ...|$|E
