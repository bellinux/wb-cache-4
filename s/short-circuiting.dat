5|$|Along {{with the}} wire electrode, a {{shielding}} gas feeds through the welding gun, which shields the process from contaminants in the air. The {{process can be}} semi-automatic or automatic. A constant voltage, direct current power source is most commonly used with GMAW, but constant current systems, as well as alternating current, can be used. There are four primary methods of metal transfer in GMAW, called globular, <b>short-circuiting,</b> spray, and pulsed-spray, {{each of which has}} distinct properties and corresponding advantages and limitations.|$|E
5|$|When invading another's house, {{the player}} can attempt to deter these {{defenses}} in such ways as smashing windows, dismantling walls, <b>short-circuiting</b> machines, and even drugging guard dogs with tainted meat, {{in addition to}} killing any residents that are armed. Reaching a vault is always possible with enough skill; the game forces players to escape their own traps before other players can access them. Being caught in one's own traps has the same consequence as any other trap in the game: permadeath.|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} <b>short-circuit</b> oscillations {{in power}} lines. <b>Short-circuit</b> currents generate electromagnetic {{forces on the}} conductors, exciting <b>short-circuit</b> oscillations. Since the <b>short-circuit</b> periods are very short, the <b>short-circuit</b> forces in single conductor overhead lines are usually low {{because of the large}} phase spacing. However these forces may have considerable impact on distribution lines due to the change in phase spacing during <b>short-circuit</b> occurrences. For bundle conductor lines, the <b>short-circuit</b> forces between subconductors are significantly higher due to the small distance between them. Methods for estimating the compressive forces on bundle conductor spacers or spacer dampers are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This work {{consists}} of two major parts - theoretical and practical. The theoretical part describes the course of <b>short-circuit</b> current in time, its components, characteristic values, and various types of <b>short-circuits</b> that may occur in electrification network. The theoretical part also describes the method of symmetrical components, its principles, fundamental relations and its use for handling the <b>short-circuit</b> current in electrification network, especially the asymmetrical <b>short-circuits.</b> The last theoretical section following the method of symmetrical components shows a summary of formulas used to calculate substitute <b>short-circuit</b> impedances in various elements of electrification network. The practical part then tries to answer how to handle <b>short-circuit</b> currents in a given network using the method of symmetrical components. Calculation is made {{for each type of}} <b>short-circuit</b> that may occur in the network, and voltage and current ratios are given for the point of <b>short-circuit</b> {{as well as for the}} point of a distance protection; main evaluated parameter of calculation is a <b>short-circuit</b> impedance measured by the distance protection. The conclusion of the practical part specifies why a compensation of distance protection is needed in ground <b>short-circuits...</b>|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{transient}} phenomena in the electricity grid - especially with <b>short-circuits.</b> First part describes <b>short-circuit</b> types, {{reasons for their}} commencement and also consequences of their functioning. The thesis further shows waveforms of <b>short-circuit</b> currents and its components. A method of calculating <b>short-circuits</b> currents, using the constituent systems and the basic equations for calculating <b>short-circuit</b> impedances are also mentioned here. Relations and methods are based on valid standards of IEC 60909 – 0. The second part indicates the calculation of two-phase and three-phase <b>short-circuit</b> currents for specific network of industrial building. This calculation aims to verify the dimensioning of substations for <b>short-circuit</b> currents after connecting a synchronous generator with given power to the main substation...|$|R
5|$|On April 19, 1998, a fire {{broke out}} in the main {{building}} of the monastery complex, which contained valuable paintings, artifacts and statues. The fire {{is believed to have been}} caused by electrical <b>short-circuiting</b> or flickering butter lamps lighting the hanging tapestries. A monk also died during the fire. The restoration works were undertaken at an estimated cost of 135 million ngultrum. The Government of Bhutan and the then King of Bhutan, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, oversaw the restoration of the damaged monastery and its contents in 2005.|$|E
5|$|A {{variation}} of the spray transfer mode, pulse-spray {{is based on the}} principles of spray transfer but uses a pulsing current to melt the filler wire and allow one small molten droplet to fall with each pulse. The pulses allow the average current to be lower, decreasing the overall heat input and thereby decreasing the size of the weld pool and heat-affected zone while making it possible to weld thin workpieces. The pulse provides a stable arc and no spatter, since no <b>short-circuiting</b> takes place. This also makes the process suitable for nearly all metals, and thicker electrode wire can be used as well. The smaller weld pool gives the variation greater versatility, making it possible to weld in all positions. In comparison with short arc GMAW, this method has a somewhat slower maximum speed (85mm/s or 200in/min) and the process also requires that the shielding gas be primarily argon with a low carbon dioxide concentration. Additionally, it requires a special power source capable of providing current pulses with a frequency between 30 and 400 pulses per second. However, the method has gained popularity, since it requires lower heat input and can be used to weld thin workpieces, as well as nonferrous materials.|$|E

25|$|The coils {{which produce}} the {{magnetic}} field are located within the lens yoke. The coils can contain a variable current, but typically use high voltages, and therefore require significant insulation {{in order to prevent}} <b>short-circuiting</b> the lens components. Thermal distributors are placed to ensure the extraction of the heat generated by the energy lost to resistance of the coil windings. The windings may be water-cooled, using a chilled water supply in order to facilitate the removal of the high thermal duty.|$|E

25|$|Interrelationships among {{nutrient}} cycling, regeneration, {{and subsequent}} forest development on floodplains in interior Alaska were addressed by Van Cleve et al. (1980), who {{pointed out that}} the various stages in primary succession reflect physical, chemical, and biological controls of ecosystem structure and function. Thus, each successional stage has a species combination in harmony with site quality. <b>Short-circuiting</b> succession by planting a late successional species such as white spruce on an early successional surface may result in markedly reduced growth rates because of nitrogen insufficiency. Without application of substantial amounts of fertilizer, use would have to be made of early successional alder and its site-ameliorating additions of nitrogen.|$|E
25|$|The eternal {{problem with}} {{compounds}} is starting: for all cylinders {{to take their}} weight, it is advisable to have some way of <b>short-circuiting</b> the HP cylinders and getting steam at a reduced pressure directly to the LP cylinder(s); hence many of the patented compound systems are associated with particular starting arrangements. The de Glehn 4-cylinder system is probably still the most sophisticated of all with independent HP & LP cut-off and a rotary valve, called a lanterne allowing independent working or combinations of HP and LP groups. Most other systems employ starting valves of various kinds. Another criterion is whether the valve gears {{of the two groups}} are wholly independent or linked together in some way.|$|E
25|$|The {{result was}} the Antiquities Act of 1906, a towering piece of American {{legislation}} by any standards. As {{a result of the}} Antiquities Act, it was now no longer necessary for Congress to authorize permanent withdrawal of land for the purpose of preservation of cultural or other resources; a presidential proclamation would now suffice. This apparent <b>short-circuiting</b> of separation of powers was controversial at the time, and has remained so for the 100 years since its passage, but Lacey's experienced hand guided the bill through Congress, meeting the objections of its critics and propelling it toward passage and presidential signature. President Theodore Roosevelt signed the Antiquities Act into law on June 8, 1906, and Hewett's place {{in the history of the}} conservation movement was secured. Ironically, Roosevelt's first use of the Antiquities Act was not to protect one of the ruins that Hewett had made his life's passion, but rather to establish Devil's Tower National Monument in Wyoming, a site of more geological and scenic interest than archaeological significance. However, the Act would soon be put, repeatedly and vigorously, to its (or at least Hewett's) intended purpose.|$|E
3000|$|To {{improve the}} {{accuracy}} of fault location system, several <b>short-circuit</b> tests need [...] to be conducted before being brought into service in autotransformer (AT) feeding systems for high-speed railways in China. However, no systematic algorithm yet exists to evaluate {{the consistency of the}} current distribution of <b>short-circuit</b> tests. A methodology is proposed in this paper to address this problem. Based on Kirchhoff’s current law and the generalized method of symmetrical components, the current deviations of the AT feeding systems are analysed and then normalized with the <b>short-circuit</b> current as they vary greatly with systems and <b>short-circuit</b> sites. It is also found that the <b>short-circuit</b> current varies with the calculation methods, and its unbiased standard deviation also reflects the consistency of the <b>short-circuit</b> test. The mean and maximum of the current deviations, as well as the unbiased standard deviation of the <b>short-circuit</b> current, show the consistency of the <b>short-circuit</b> test from different aspects, although the last two items are highly relevant. Therefore, a unified evaluation index is defined as the sum of the three items, and then applied in two case studies to test its performance. The results show that, the proposed index can clearly distinguish the consistency of the <b>short-circuit</b> tests and may be used to sort the <b>short-circuit</b> tests for fault location systems. Besides, some <b>short-circuit</b> tests may have very poor consistency indices, and thus are not applicable to the tuning of fault location systems. In the authors’ opinion, the determination of the threshold of the proposed index needs further investigation.|$|R
30|$|The {{structure}} of the two-level VSC-HVDC system is shown in Fig.  2. The DC side faults in the system can be categorized as two-pole <b>short-circuit</b> fault, single-pole <b>short-circuit</b> fault and disconnection fault, among which the two-pole <b>short-circuit</b> fault is the most harmful. Therefore, this paper analyzes the energy exchange process of the DC side {{in the case of}} a two-pole <b>short-circuit</b> fault. On this basis, the current-limiting performance of the SI-FCL is studied.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{investigated}} the <b>short-circuit</b> capabilities of 1. 2 kV normally-off SiC buried gate static induction transistors (SiC-BGSITs). The maximum <b>short-circuit</b> energy {{was found to}} be 35. 6 J/cm 2 which is twice that of normally-on SiC-BGSITs and 3. 3 – 5. 6 times higher than that of the Si-IGBTs. The maximum <b>short-circuit</b> time was 590 µs. It is concluded that these high <b>short-circuit</b> capabilities result from saturation characteristics of the normally-off SiC-BGSITs...|$|R
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{efficiency}} often improves if the recursion is stopped at relatively large base cases, {{and these are}} solved non-recursively, resulting in a hybrid algorithm. This strategy avoids the overhead of recursive calls that do little or no work, and may also allow the use of specialized non-recursive algorithms that, for those base cases, are more efficient than explicit recursion. A general procedure for a simple hybrid recursive algorithm is <b>short-circuiting</b> the base case, also known as arm's-length recursion. In this case whether the next step {{will result in the}} base case is checked before the function call, avoiding an unnecessary function call. For example, in a tree, rather than recursing to a child node and then checking if it is null, checking null before recursing; this avoids half the function calls in some algorithms on binary trees. Since a D algorithm eventually reduces each problem or sub-problem instance to a large number of base instances, these often dominate the overall cost of the algorithm, especially when the splitting/joining overhead is low. Note that these considerations do not depend on whether recursion is implemented by the compiler or by an explicit stack.|$|E
25|$|Instead of her psychic knife, Psylocke {{began to}} {{manifest}} a telekinetic katana composed of raw psionic energy. At its lowest intensity her katana functions much like her psychic knife once did, <b>short-circuiting</b> the victim's nervous system on impact. At its highest level, the katana can slice through almost any physical matter. Psylocke's {{control over the}} katana is such that she can slice an armored opponent and cut through the armor, but only leave her opponent stunned or unconscious. Psylocke's telekinetic manifestations produce visible radiance in the physical world, and so she can use her psychic katana as a makeshift light source in areas of darkness. The katana can also affect beings that are more powerful than Psylocke herself. She can also use her sword to shatter telepathic power-inhibitors imposed on others, despite her own lack of telepathy. With no telepathy to guide her when performing this task, she must rely on her instincts to give the blade the sufficient strength necessary to break the inhibitors, without doing permanent damage to the subject in question. During the timeline shift known as House of M, Psylocke showed the ability to summon two telekinetic katanas at the same time. It is unknown if she is capable of this under normal circumstances.|$|E

500|$|Electrode {{selection}} is {{based primarily on}} {{the composition of the}} metal being welded, the process variation being used, joint design and the material surface conditions. Electrode selection greatly influences the mechanical properties of the weld and is a key factor of weld quality. In general the finished weld metal should have mechanical properties {{similar to those of the}} base material with no defects such as discontinuities, entrained contaminants or porosity within the weld. To achieve these goals a wide variety of electrodes exist. [...] All commercially available electrodes contain deoxidizing metals such as silicon, manganese, titanium and aluminum in small percentages to help prevent oxygen porosity. Some contain denitriding metals such as titanium and zirconium to avoid nitrogen porosity. Depending on the process variation and base material being welded the diameters of the electrodes used in GMAW typically range from 0.7 to 2.4mm (0.028 – 0.095in) but can be as large as 4mm (0.16in). The smallest electrodes, generally up to 1.14mm (0.045in) are associated with the <b>short-circuiting</b> metal transfer process, while the most common spray-transfer process mode electrodes are usually at least 0.9mm (0.035in).|$|E
