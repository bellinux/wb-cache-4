50|$|Although {{the belt}} course has its origins as a {{structural}} {{component of a}} building, by the 18th century it was almost purely a decorative element and had no functional purpose. In brick or stone buildings taller than three stories, however, a <b>shelf</b> <b>angle</b> is usually used to transfer the load of the wall to a hidden, interior steel wall. Flashing is used to cover the space exposed by the <b>shelf</b> <b>angle</b> to help limit the intrusion of water. Where flashing is considered aesthetically unpleasing, a belt course is often used.|$|E
5000|$|The {{invention}} of skeleton frame buildings {{made it possible}} to reduce the thickness of the walls and have wide openings such as ribbon windows extending across most or all of the building facade. In these buildings, brick, stone, or other masonry cladding is often just a single wythe of material called a veneer since it is non-loadbearing. The only way to support the weight of this veneer across a wide opening is by providing a <b>shelf</b> <b>angle</b> on which the masonry bears. The <b>shelf</b> <b>angle,</b> in turn, is attached to major elements of the building structure such as floor beams or structural columns. Shelf angles are in reality a horizontal expansion joint which allows growth of the brick below the <b>shelf</b> <b>angle</b> and to allow movement or shrinkage of the frame without putting stresses on the brick veneer. [...] In the United States, common sizes for steel shelf angles include L 3" [...] x 3" [...] x 1/4" [...] and L 4" [...] x 4" [...] x 1/4".In the UK and Europe shelf angles / masonry support are predominantly manufactured in stainless steel to prevent corrosion and failure. These are bespoke to the building's frame and engineered to take the loads required.|$|E
50|$|In masonry veneer {{building}} construction, a <b>shelf</b> <b>angle</b> or masonry {{support is}} a steel angle which supports {{the weight of}} brick or stone veneer and transfers that weight onto the main structure of the building so that a gap or space can be created beneath to allow building movements to occur.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively, stone {{cladding}} {{can be a}} natural stone that has been quarried and then cut into thin pieces to reduce weight. Being heavier, natural {{stone cladding}} often needs mechanical fixing to be adhered to substrates. Mechanical fixing could be using <b>shelf</b> <b>angles,</b> or perhaps a product called stone clip.|$|R
40|$|Spalling, {{cracking}} and bulging of {{the brick}} and stone veneers of tall concrete buildings occur {{because of the}} shortening, due to shrinkage and creep, of the concrete structure, to which the veneer is rigidly attached, thus causing high stress. The stress may be avoided by providing a movement joint below the <b>shelf</b> <b>angles</b> of brick veneer construction. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
50|$|Because the masonry veneer is non-structural, {{it must be}} {{tied back}} to the {{building}} structure to prevent movement under wind and earthquake loads. This is usually accomplished by a means that does not interrupt the drainage plane and does not compromise cavity insulation. Brick ties are used for this purpose, and may {{take the form of}} corrugated metal straps nailed or screwed to the structural framing, or as wire extensions to horizontal joint reinforcement in a fully masonry veneer system. Although the veneer is vertically self-supporting, <b>shelf</b> <b>angles</b> are often used in multi-story buildings, typically at floor edges, to provide a horizontal expansion joint that allows expansion of the brick and potential shrinkage of the frame. In multi-story buildings, such a system may be called a curtain wall.|$|R
50|$|Interior and {{exterior}} finishes and facades are affixed {{directly to the}} ICF surface or tie ends, {{depending on the type}} of ICF. Brick and masonry facades require an extended ledge or <b>shelf</b> <b>angle</b> at the main floor level, but otherwise no modifications are necessary. Interior ICF polystyrene wall surfaces must be covered with drywall panels or other wall coatings. During the first months immediately after construction, minor problems with interior humidity may be evident as the concrete cures, which can damage the drywall. Dehumidification can be accomplished with small residential dehumidifiers or using the building's air conditioning system.|$|E
40|$|Smart {{materials}} are predicted to ‘revolutionise ’ the A/E/C industry. They {{are supposed to}} enable a building to change colour, shape, size and opacity. However, past research shows that smart {{materials are}} still not used very often in engineering applications to their full potential. In this publication we advocate that materials should not be only chosen for simple properties such as visual, physical and insulating characteristics, but for capabilities such as being able to save/generate energy, store information, and to react to stimuli from their local environment. Therefore, this paper will research into the addition of SolaVeil to a window, its physical configuration and the possibility to model and analyse it through Building Performance simulation (BPS). This material is primarily designed to eliminate glare and redirect light. As a result it can reduce energy use caused by air conditioning and artificial lighting systems. This paper researches into the behaviour of SolaVeil in a computer simulation using two different case studies. The first will compare how changing the width but maintaining the reflective area affects illuminance distribution, and the second will determine which physical properties of SolaVeil are most effective. Finally, conclusions are drawn based on the case studies and it is shown that smaller width light shelves are the most suitable for an anti glare product. It is also determined that for SolaVeil to minimise glare in a room without compromising illuminance levels, it should have a light <b>shelf</b> <b>angle</b> of 40 degrees, cover between 40 - 60 % of a window and its strips should be spaced 5 mm...|$|E
50|$|The Shelving: The contestants, {{after being}} {{taught how to}} use a router to cut a dado in their wood, have to {{replicate}} a prototype shelf using pine boards. Casey fails after mismeasuring, while Charmaine's, Tex's, and Joe's shelves fail due to the <b>shelves</b> being <b>angled</b> downwards. Dez has a weak shelf, but after some issues with how to assemble his parts, he passes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{superstructure}} of {{the building}} featured unusually heavy columns and floor slabs designed to permit [...] on the floors {{of the first and}} second basement and the first and second floor, and [...] on floors three and higher. In order to accommodate the weight of the boiler, coal bin, ash bin, and associated equipment {{at the rear of the}} second basement, a portion of this floor was designed to withstand [...] The octagonal, steel core-and-concrete columns in this area were 59 ft tall, extending from the foundation up to the second floor. Four of the exterior wall columns as well as all interior columns in the three basements and first floor were also steel core-and-concrete, to support the stresses on the structure below-ground. Above the second floor, all columns were reinforced concrete. The bases of all the columns consisted of cast iron-and-two-way reinforced concrete. All column caps were reinforced with <b>shelf</b> <b>angles</b> attached to the flanges and core reinforcement plates, and all columns were topped with octagonal plates reinforced with stiffeners. Above the second floor, all column tops were flared to help support the floor slab above. Due to complications created by the William Edwards building next to it, there were fewer exterior and interior columns in the structure's southwest corner. Instead, 7 ft cantilevers supported the exterior walls above the third floor.|$|R
60|$|On {{the table}} {{were a few}} books, a large, square, crystal bottle of some novel perfume, a plain ground--glass astral (not solar) lamp with an Italian shade, and a large vase of resplendently-blooming flowers. Flowers, indeed, of {{gorgeous}} colours and delicate odour formed the sole mere decoration of the apartment. The fire-place was nearly filled with a vase of brilliant geranium. On a triangular <b>shelf</b> in each <b>angle</b> of the room stood also a similar vase, varied only as to its lovely contents. One or two smaller bouquets adorned the mantel, and late violets clustered about the open windows.|$|R
40|$|Daylight can be {{considered}} {{as one of the most}} important principles of sustainable architecture. It is unfortunate that this is neglected by designers in Tehran, a city that benefits from a significant amount of daylight and many clear sunny days during the year. Using a daylight controller system increases space natural light quality and decreases building lighting consumption by 60 %. It also affects building thermal behavior, because most of them operate as shading. The light shelf is one of the passive systems for controlling daylight, mostly used with shading and installed in the upper half of the windows above eye level. The influence of light shelf parameters, such as its dimensions, <b>shelf</b> rotation <b>angle</b> and orientation on daylight efficiency and visual comfort in educational spaces is investigated in this article. Daylight simulation software and annual analysis based on climate information during space occupation hours were used. The results show that light shelf dimensions, as well as different orientations, especially in southern part, are influential in the distribution of natural light and visual comfort. At the southern orientation, increased light shelf dimensions result in an increase of the area of the work plane with suitable daylight levels by 2 %– 40 % and a significant decrease in disturbing and intolerable glare hours...|$|R
40|$|A {{description}} is given of a high-bay warehousing system with an order picker and placer {{consisting of a}} vertical mast construction which can be moved longitudinally along the aisle and load-bearing devices which can be aligned with the shelves for placing or picking orders and which can be moved towards the <b>shelves</b> at right <b>angles</b> to the aisle. At least one load suspension device is mounted on the mast construction for each level of shelves. Each of these load suspension devices bears a crossover conveyor mounted on the rigid platform or a rigid frame (16); each crossover conveyor can be adjusted over the entire length and beyond {{the end of the}} platform or frame. This crossover conveyor is designed as a carriage (23) which runs in guides (24 a, 24 b) of the platform or frame. A linear drive arranged on the platform of the frame (16) acts on the carriage. On both ends of the carriage (23) there are locks (32) for the storage unit which can be raised and lowered transversely in relation to the direction of movement. These locks can also be coupled with an actuator which is located partly on the carriage (23) and partly on the platform or frame (16) ...|$|R
