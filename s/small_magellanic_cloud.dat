5|$|Located at the {{southern}} end of Tucana, the <b>Small</b> <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Cloud</b> is a dwarf galaxy that is one of the nearest neighbors to the Milky Way galaxy at a distance of 210,000 light-years. Though it probably formed as a disk shape, tidal forces from the Milky Way have distorted it. Along with the Large Magellanic Cloud, it lies within the Magellanic Stream, a cloud of gas that connects the two galaxies. NGC 346 is a star-forming region located in the <b>Small</b> <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Cloud.</b> It has an apparent magnitude of 10.3. Within it lies the triple star system HD 5980, each of its members among the most luminous stars known.|$|E
5|$|Tucana {{is not a}} {{prominent}} constellation as all of its stars are third magnitude or fainter; the brightest is Alpha Tucanae with an apparent visual magnitude of 2.87. Beta Tucanae is a star system with six member stars, while Kappa is a quadruple system. Five star systems {{have been found to}} have exoplanets to date. The constellation contains 47 Tucanae, one of the brightest globular clusters in the sky, and most of the <b>Small</b> <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Cloud.</b>|$|E
5|$|Located {{mostly in}} Dorado, the Large Magellanic Cloud extends into Hydrus. The {{globular}} cluster NGC 1466 is an outlying {{component of the}} galaxy, and contains many RR Lyrae-type variable stars. It has a magnitude of 11.59 and {{is thought to be}} over 12 billion years old. Two stars, HD 24188 of magnitude 6.3 and HD 24115 of magnitude 9.0, lie nearby in its foreground. NGC 602 is composed of an emission nebula and a young, bright open cluster of stars that is an outlying component on {{the eastern edge of the}} <b>Small</b> <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Cloud,</b> a satellite galaxy to the Milky Way. Most of the cloud is located in the neighbouring constellation Tucana.|$|E

5|$|The second-brightest {{globular}} cluster {{in the sky}} after Omega Centauri, 47 Tucanae (NGC 104) lies {{just west of the}} <b>Small</b> <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Cloud.</b> Only 14,700 light-years distant from Earth, it is thought to be around 12 billion years old. Mostly composed of old, yellow stars, it does possess a contingent of blue stragglers, hot stars that are hypothesized to form from binary star mergers. 47 Tucanae has an apparent magnitude of 3.9, meaning that it is visible to the naked eye; it is a Shapley class III cluster, which means that it has a clearly defined nucleus. Near to 47 Tucana on the sky, and often seen in wide-field photographs showing it, are two much more distant {{globular cluster}}s associated with the SMC: NGC 121, 10 arcminutes away from the bigger cluster's edge, and Lindsay 8.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war Woolley {{redirected}} the Commonwealth Observatory from solar research {{towards the}} study of stars and galaxies. It took time to get the old and unused telescopes back up to working condition: they had to be overhauled and refurbished, and in one case rebuilt from scrap. Woolley got funding approval from the Prime Minister for construction of a 74-inch telescope, but it would not be finished for years. Gascoigne began to work in the nascent field of photoelectric photometry, using electrical devices to measure the brightness of stars more accurately than had been possible using photographic techniques. In 1951, with equipment brought by visiting astronomer Gerald Kron from California's Lick Observatory, he observed Cepheid variable stars, which are used to measure astronomical distances. Granted nine months of observing time on the Observatory's Reynolds 30-inch reflector telescope – an extraordinary opportunity – Gascoigne, Kron and others surveyed Cepheid stars in both the <b>Small</b> <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Cloud</b> and, later, the Large Magellanic Cloud. They also examined the colours of star clusters in the Small Cloud.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present the}} first {{results of our}} study of stellar populations in the Large and <b>Small</b> <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Clouds</b> based on {{multiband}} WFPC 2 observations of “random ” fields taken {{as part of the}} “pure parallel ” program carried out by the Space Telescope Science Institute as a service to the community. We have started a study of the stellar populations in the Large and <b>Small</b> <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Clouds</b> using data (U, B, V, I and Hα imaging) collected as part of the WFPC 2 Pure Parallel Program (Wadadekar et al. 2006). We have considered a number of fields in both <b>Magellanic</b> <b>Clouds</b> which comprise stellar populations with ages ranging from a few Myr to a few Gyr and in which pre-main-sequence objects are clearly identified. In addition to the properties of these populations, we have studied the characteristics of the dust present in these regions. Using the properties of the red giants of the so-called “red clump ” (RC) in the various colour-magnitude diagrams, we have determined the extinction law in each field (Panagia & De Marchi 2005). We find that not only the amount of extinction but also its wavelength dependence varies considerably from site t...|$|R
