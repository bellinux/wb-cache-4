40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to find out the best {{variation}} of extraction method and sappan wood concentration for herbal jelly candy based on physical (hardness, springiness and gumminess), chemical (moisture content, aw and pH), functional (total phenols and antioxidant activity) and sensory (color, aroma, taste, texture and overall) characteristics. This study used the Completely Randomized Factorial Design (CRFD) with two factors, they were, variation of extraction method (boiling and steeping) and variation of sappan wood concentration (3 : 36 (b/v); 4 : 36 (b/v); dan 6 : 36 (b/v)). The result showed that variations of extraction method affected springiness (1, 607 - 2, 398 mm) and gumminess (42, 803 - 52, 957 gf) but not hardness (2. 427 - 2. 503 gf), they affected moisture content (31, 802 - 33, 648 %wb) but not aw (0, 838 - 0, 846) and pH (6, 235 - 6, 318), they also affected total phenols (1, 319 - 1, 742 %db) and antioxidant activity (13, 946 - 52, 803 %db). The variations of sappan wood concentration had effects on hardness (1. 779 - 3. 559 gf) but not on springiness (1, 587 - 2, 631 mm) and gumminess (3, 042 - 6. 455 gf), they had effects on moisture content (29, 60 - 35, 23 %wb) but not on aw (0, 828 - 0, 850) and pH (6, 148 - 6, 409), and they also had effects on total phenols (0, 878 - 2, 296 %db) and antioxidant activity (2, 324 - 4, 429 %db) of the herbal jelly candy. Based on sensory characteristics, the most preferred was the <b>steeping</b> <b>treatment</b> jelly candy with sappan wood concentration of 4 : 36, while physically the best jelly candy was the one with <b>steeping</b> <b>treatment</b> and the sappan wood concentration of 3 : 36. Based on chemical and functional characteristics, the jelly candy with boiling treatment and sappan wood concentration of 6 : 36 was the best.

40|$|Chemical {{treatments}} in {{wet milling}} could improve the physico-chemical properties of starch isolated from high-tannin sorghums. Sorghums Chirimaugute (medium-tannin), DC- 75 (high-tannin), and SV 2 (tannin-free) were steeped in water, dilute HCl (0. 9 %, v/v), formaldehyde (0. 05 %, v/v), and NaOH (0. 3 %, w/v) solutions before wet milling and starch separation. Pasting, textural, and thermal properties of starch were determined. Steeping in NaOH resulted in starches with higher peak viscosity (PV), cool paste viscosity (CPV), and setback than when water, HCl, and formaldehyde were used. The time to PV (Ptime) and PV temperature (Ptemp) were markedly reduced by treatment with NaOH. NaOH {{could have caused}} a degree of pregelatinization. HCl treatment gave starches with higher Ptemp and Ptime, presumably due to delayed granule swelling. Gel hardness was largely determined by the starch amylose content. The low hardness of DC- 75 starch gels was slightly improved in NaOH-treated grains. Gelatinization temperatures of sorghum starches were generally low, regardless of <b>steeping</b> <b>treatment.</b> Starch from NaOH-treated grain generally had slightly higher gelatinization temperatures than when water, HCl, or HCHO was used. Chemical treatments during steeping of sorghum grains greatly affected starch properties.

40|$|In {{previous}} studies, Bacillus subtilis {{has been}} used to control mould growth during red sorghum malting. The use of this biocontrol in steeping liquor has been optimized with some success and the combined use of a 0. 2 % NaOH steep, followed by a resteep in a Bacillus subtilis-based biocontrol, has been proposed. The sharpness and variability of the β-amylase peak and the higher levels of β-glucanase obtained in the presence of B. subtilis cells were highlighted. In this work, the suitability of the Weibull 4 Parameters Model to predict sorghum malt α-amylase activity during the enzyme induction stage of red sorghum germination has been compared with those of a 2 nd Order Polynomial Model and a General Linear Model. Results obtained showed that the Weibull 4 Parameters Model could be used to predict α-amylase activity, with significant goodness of fit when compared to the 2 nd Order Polynomial Model and to the General Linear Model. The effects of <b>steeping</b> <b>treatment</b> (combined use of 0. 2 % NaOH and Bacillus subtilis S 499 starters) and the germination temperature are presented. When the Bacillus subtilis culture used as a starter was diluted, the treatment efficacy to develop α-amylase activity was lost.

40|$|Previous work having {{shown that}} Bacillus-subtilis-S 499 -based {{biocontrol}} treatments applied without aeration at the steeping stage of red sorghum malting offered good mould reduction but yielded malts with {{low levels of}} key hydrolytic enzymes, we attempted to raise these levels by aerating the steeping liquor, varying the steeping time (from 8 to 40 h) and temperature (from 25 to 35 °C), and combining a biocontrol <b>treatment</b> with prior <b>steeping</b> in 0. 2 % NaOH. Aeration proved particularly important whenever B. subtilis cells were present in the steep liquor. The optimal temperatures for α- and β-amylase were 30 and 25 °C, respectively. By increasing the steeping time it was possible to improve the α-amylase activity, but the -amylase activity peaked sharply between 16 and 20 h, depending on the steeping medium. A good compromise was steeping in biocontrol medium for 14 to 16 h at 30 °C. Combination <b>steeping</b> <b>treatments</b> (0. 2 % NaOH for 8 h followed by biocontrol for 8 h) yielded malts of a quality approaching that afforded by dilute alkaline treatment.

40|$|An {{investigation}} is presented {{of the utility}} of semiclassical approximations for solving the quantum-impurity problems arising in the dynamical-mean-field approach to the correlated-electron models. The method is based on performing a exact numerical integral over the zero-Matsubara-frequency component of the spin part of a continuous Hubbard-Stratonovich field, along with a spin-field-dependent <b>steepest</b> descents <b>treatment</b> of the charge part. We test this method by applying it {{to one or two}} site approximations to the single band Hubbard model with different band structures, and comparing the results to quantum Monte-Carlo and simplified exact diagonalization calculations. The resulting electron self-energies, densities of states and magnetic transition temperatures show reasonable agreement with the quantum Monte-Carlo simulation over wide parameter ranges, suggesting that the semiclassical method is useful for obtaining a reasonable picture of the physics in situations where other techniques are too expensive.

40|$|Malting is {{the ideal}} stage to deal with β-glucans. Their {{hydrolysis}} is very important as the diffusion of both hormones and hydrolytic enzymes in the endosperm of germinated grain depend on it. A high malt β-glucanase activity is not a guarantee of an extensive hydrolysis of β-glucans. When Bacillus subtilis is used to control mould growth, red sorghum malt β-glucanase activity (measured using carboxymethylcellulose as the substrate) was improved without significantly affecting the hydrolysis of malt β-glucans. Thus, {{in order to reduce}} the residual β-glucans content, soaking in 0. 2 % NaOH was combined with a biocontrol. Soaking in 0. 2 % NaOH is recognized as capable of improving grain hydration by opening-up the endosperm cell walls. The combined use of 0. 2 % NaOH with Bacillus subtilis-based biocontrol treatments during red sorghum malting, leads to malt with increased β-glucanase activity and a significant reduction of residual β-glucans when compared with the 16 h biocontrol steeping without prior steeping in 0. 2 % NaOH. β-glucanase activity increases with increased germination temperature and time while, conversely, the residual β-glucans content of the malts decreases. Indeed, while the level of β-glucanase was not vastly different between the malts obtained after steeping in distilled water and those obtained after 8 h steeping in 0. 2 % NaOH followed by 8 h resteeping in distilled water (NaOH+H 2 O treatment), their residual β-glucans levels differ significantly. Bacillus subtilis-based treatment leads to malt with improved β-(1 - 3) - and β-(1 - 4) -glucanase activities without significantly improved malt β-(1 - 3),(1 - 4) -glucanase activity. While malts obtained after 84 h germination weren’t significantly different in terms of malt β-(1 - 3),(1 - 4) -glucanase activities for all <b>steeping</b> <b>treatments,</b> the use of 0. 2 % NaOH steeping prior to resteeping led to malts with improved β-glucans content. Combining the steeping in dilute alkaline and biocontrol enables taking advantage of the dilute alkaline effect on residual β-glucans content, due probably to the opening-up the cell walls and the improvement of water uptake, and that of the biocontrol (improvement of β-glucanase synthesis).

40|$|Steeping milled sorghum {{in up to}} 0. 4 % NaOH was {{investigated}} {{as a method of}} tannin inactivation. NaOH steeping substantially reduced assayable total phenols and tannins in both Type III and Type II sorghums and with Type III sorghum caused a 60 – 80 % reduction in a-amylase inhibition compared to a 20 % reduction by water <b>steeping.</b> NaOH <b>treatment</b> also reduced starch liquefaction time and increased free amino nitrogen. Type II tannin sorghum did not inhibit a-amylase and consequently the NaOH treatment had no effect. HPLC and LC–MS of the tannin extracts indicated a general trend of increasing proanthocyanidin/ procyanidin size with increasing NaOH concentration and steeping time, coupled with a reduction in total area of peaks resolved. These show that the NaOH treatment forms highly polymerised tannin compounds, too large to assay and to interact with the a-amylase. NaOH pre-treatment of Type III sorghums could enable their utilisation in bioethanol production. Howard G. Buffet Foundation through the Norman Borlaug Institute of Texas A&M University. [URL]...|$|R

There were no differences (P> 0, 05) between the roasted and raw soybeans diets related either to dry matter or crude protein intakes, milk yield and composition and plasma urea nitrogen (PUN) and milk urea nitrogen (MUN) concentrations, but roasted soybeans yielded significantly (P< 0, 05) more milk per kg of dry matter or crude protein intake than raw soybeans...|$|R
50|$|Fire {{is often}} {{considered}} a low cost method of improving rangeland condition. It {{has been given}} attention in the control of medusahead {{because many of the}} areas infested with it are too rocky or <b>steep</b> for other <b>treatments.</b> Control of medusahead with fire had differing results in California. In some areas, more desirable plant communities came back after a fire, while in other areas medusahead continued to dominate after fire. There are a few guidelines that should be followed when burning medusahead. The burn should be conducted when the seed is in the soft dough stage (when the seeds exude a milky substance when squeezed) in the late spring. The initial fire should be one that is slow burning, something that is easily achieved by burning into the wind. This prevents the fire from advancing too rapidly and ensures that the current year's herbage is burned and periods of maximum temperature are long enough to kill medusahead caryopses. Viable medusahead caryopses are found almost entirely in the litter and on the soil surface.|$|R
40|$|Excimer laser {{photorefractive keratectomy}} (PRK) has evolved to a widely {{performed}} procedure. The excimer laser corrects refractive ametropias by removing a calculated amount of anterior corneal stroma with great precision and with minimal {{damage to the}} adjacent tissues. The correction of myopia up to - 5. 00 diopters (D) with excimer laser ablation yields good results with 99 % of the final refractions within ± 1. 00 D of that intended. In some patients, however, the clinical practice faces problems like insufficient predictability in refractive outcome, haze and myopic regression in the postoperative course. Hyaluronan (HA) has been detected in the wound area after excimer laser surgery in the rabbit cornea {{as well as in}} a few human corneal specimens. In paper I we apply histochemical methods to confirm its presence in human corneas after excimer laser ablation. Hyaluronan in wound scrapings of corneas that had to be reoperated because of unsatisfactory outcome has been associated with aggressive myopic regression and with severe haze. Hyaluronan is capable of binding considerable amounts of water. In paper II we apply quantitative microradiography and histochemical HA staining to demonstrate its subepithelial colocalization with water in rabbit corneas postoperatively. The final result of excimer laser surgery depends on the ablation quality and on the individual corneal healing response to the treatment quality. Ablation depth, -diameter and -slope are variables that might affect reepithelialization and stromal healing after surgery. In paper III we utilize a modified planimetry to evaluate the healing reaction by measuring the subepithelial water accumulation. Our results suggest that a shallow slope causes less activity during the subsequent healing, when compared to a <b>steep</b> curve refractive <b>treatment.</b> Any departure from a smooth surface might degrade the optical qualities of the ablated cornea and thereby impair the clinical results. Paper IV provides information about the time course of stromal irregularities and their impact on wound healing as compared to a rather smooth postablational surface. Corticosteroids are still the primary therapeutical agent proposed to modulate the corneal healing response. Corticosteroids may influence the refractive result after PRK at least by two ways, one by reducing the postoperative epithelial thickness, the other by suppressing the subepithelial remodeling. Paper V addresses these issues and concludes that corticosteroids reduce subepithelial HA accumulation and prevent epithelial hyperplasia. By these means corticosteroids are likely to affect the refractive status of the cornea. In conclusion, we show that subepithelial HA is formed in human corneas after excimer laser surgery. In rabbits HA is demonstrated to colocalize with water in the subepithelial area. The planimetric evaluation of subepithelial water accumulation shows that a <b>steep</b> curve refractive <b>treatment</b> causes more healing reaction when compared to an ablation with shallow slope, this independently to treatment depth. The inflammatory response is more pronounced after a laser treatment leaving postablational surface irregularities, when compared to a laser treatment leaving a smooth postablational surface. Corticosteroids are shown to reduce subepithelial HA accumulation and prevent epithelial hyperplasia...|$|R

This study investigated MWI effects on vermicasts potency, plant growth and biochemical activity in Chinese cabbage ‘Bilko’ seedlings. Fresh, moist vermicasts were microwaved at power output levels: 0, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 800 Watts (W). Water loss, nutrients and total aerobic plate content were assessed. A complete randomized design greenhouse experiment {{was used to evaluate}} seedlings growth performance and tissue bioactivity. Water loss increased from 5  mg/g (0  W) to 215  mg/g (800  W). Total dissolved solids and electrical conductivity of the vermicasts gradually increased with an increase in MWI power output level from 0 to 200  W. This was followed by a <b>steep</b> rise through <b>treatment</b> 300  W and a peak at 400  W. Total nitrogen and nitrate decreased, while ammonia-nitrogen and nitrite-nitrogen increased at higher power levels. Similarly, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, calcium, manganese, barium and molybdenum contents increased while sodium and barium remained fairly constant. However, MWI irradiation reduced total aerobic plate count by ≥ 50 %. Plant growth and biomass were increased by the 400  W and 800  W MWI treatments. Antioxidant activity was highest in 200, 400 and 800  W treated plants. Collectively the finding indicated that the 400  W treatment increased the bioavailability of nutrients, and represents the best option for plant growth enhancement and improved antioxidant activity...|$|R
40|$|Pressure {{natriuresis}} (PN), i. e., {{a rise in}} renal sodium excretion {{in response}} to a higher BP, is involved in long-term BP regulation. PN is blunted in essential hypertension, but the mechanism is unknown. This study assessed the role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in PN in eight essential hypertensive men from the individual correlations between spontaneous fluctuations in BP and time corresponding changes in sodium excretion (collected at 2 - and 4 -h intervals for 48 h), during strict sodium balance, without treatment, and during renin inhibition (remikiren, 600 mg oral compound). Without treatment, daily values for mean arterial pressure were 109. 5 +/- 1. 9 and 107 +/- 1. 9 mmHg, for urinary sodium excretion were 37. 2 +/- 2. 8 and 42. 0 +/- 2. 8 mmol/ 24 h, and for plasma renin activity were 2. 34 +/- 0. 48 and 2. 23 +/- 0. 44 nmol/L per h, respectively, for two consecutive days. During remikiren treatment, mean arterial pressure was 101. 9 +/- 1. 7 and 100. 8 +/- 1. 7 mmHg (P < 0. 05, versus baseline). Urinary sodium excretion was 39. 3 +/- 3. 7 and 45. 2 +/- 5. 3 mmol/ 24 h (not significant versus baseline), and plasma renin activity was 0. 79 +/- 0. 11 and 0. 82 +/- 0. 13 nmol/L per h (P < 0. 05 versus baseline). During remikiren treatment, BP correlated positively with sodium excretion in all patients but in only three of eight patients without treatment. The slope of the regression equation was <b>steeper</b> during remikiren <b>treatment</b> in seven of eight patients. Thus, the relationship between BP and natriuresis was more readily apparent during RAAS blockade, suggesting that RAAS activity blunts PN in hypertensive patients. Improved PN may contribute to the hypotensive effect of RAAS blockade and to maintenance of sodium balance at a lower BP level without volume expansion...|$|R
40|$|Background & {{objective}} : Three {{categories of}} prognostic markers are best documented as having significance {{in relation to}} prognosis of HIV infection. These include HIV viral load, CD 4 T-cell levels and plasma levels of soluble markers of immune activation. The plasma activation markers, like neopterin, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukins etc., are products of cytokine activity and represent immunologic changes throughout the body. There is not much information available on serum neopterin estimation in patients infected with both HIV and tuberculosis (TB), though neopterin levels {{are known to be}} elevated in pulmonary TB patients. In this study we attempted to correlate neopterin levels with the presence of tuberculosis in HIV infected and uninfected individuals and studied the changes after antituberculosis treatment. Methods : Serum neopterin concentrations were measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in 25 HIV-seropositive (HIV-TB) and 10 -seronegative (TB) patients with tuberculosis before, during {{and at the end of}} antituberculosis therapy (ATT). S-neo was also measured in 10 HIV-seropositive asymptomatic individuals and 10 healthy controls. The results were correlated with clinical, bacteriological and immunological status. Results : All TB patients regardless of HIV status had elevated s-neo concentrations at diagnosis, which declined gradually during treatment. Patients with HIV/TB with CD 4 counts < 200 /mm 3 had the highest levels at baseline with a <b>steep</b> fall during <b>treatment.</b> The median level at the end of treatment was significantly higher in HIV/TB than in TB patients, despite clinical improvement and bacteriological clearance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. HIV infected asymptomatic individuals had neopterin levels that were higher than healthy controls but lower than HIV-TB patients. Interpretation & conclusion : Serum neopterin levels are elevated in HIV-positive patients, with the highest levels in those with tuberculosis and CD 4 counts < 200 /mm 3. Though the levels decrease with anti tuberculosis therapy, persistently elevated levels indicate progressive HIV disease and a poor prognosis...|$|R
40|$|Diversification {{in the use}} of cassava and sorghum through {{commercial}} processing into value-added food and beverage products is an important means of developing the economies of African countries. However, potential applications of cassava and sorghum are limited by their unique structural properties and chemical composition attributes. With cassava tuber, its high fibrous material content constitutes a problem after starch hydrolysis in brewing. These cell wall materials (CWM) have high water holding capacity (85 - 90 %), which results in poor wort filtration. Cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzyme treatment of cassava cake resulted in a reduction in total solids volume and in the amount of insoluble solids. The amount of free starch granules also increased with increase in enzyme concentration. Combination of different enzyme preparations showed a synergistic effect by significantly reducing the viscosity of the cassava cake (milled cassava tuber). These effects appear to be due to complementary enzyme activities that hydrolyse the parenchyma polymer cell walls, except for the lignified materials. As determined by GC, the residual CWM monosaccharide units consisted of arabinose, rhamnose, xylose, galactose and glucose, with glucose being the most sugar units followed by xylose. This suggests that cellulosic type material is the main components of cassava CWM. The application of tannin sorghum in beverage production is limited due to the condensed tannins interacting with other grain components, which negatively affects the processing functionality and nutritional properties of the beverages. Type II and III tannin sorghums were selected for investigation of tannin inactivation through steeping the flours in 0. 1, 0. 2 and 0. 4 % alkaline (NaOH) solution. Tannin inactivation was also investigated by admixing with soy protein isolate. Sodium hydroxide steeping of the flour resulted in a substantial reduction in assayable total phenols and tannins. The effect of NaOH on the tannins in the Type III sorghum also resulted in 60 - 80 % reduction in α-amylase enzyme inhibition by the tannins. SPI treatment of Type III resulted in 76 % reduction in α-amylase inhibition by tannins. Fermentability of the Type III sorghum by lactic acid bacteria improved with NaOH <b>steeping.</b> Applying this <b>treatment</b> in a mashing process resulted in a considerable reduction in starch liquefaction time with the Type III sorghum. The normal phase HPLC profile of the tannin molecules based on the degree of polymerisation showed an increase in the polymeric tannins with the NaOH treatment. LC/MS identified procyanidins ranging from dimer to hexamer in the NaOH treated Type II flour. These procyanidins were not identified in the Type III, which indicates tannin polymerisation in both Type II and III tannin sorghums to higher polymeric proanthocyanidins. The polymerisation mechanism is proposed to be by cross-linking of the tannin molecules resulting in the formation of higher proanthocyanidin polymers. These polymerised tannins are less reactive with amylases resulting in too large tannin polymers, which can be attributed to reduction in the availaible phenolic group reactive site. Enzymatic hydrolysis of cassava CWM will improve processing application of cassava in brewing. Sodium hydroxide pre-treatment of Type III sorghum flour will improve its processing functionality for increase utilisation in beverage production. The creation of new markets for these crops should help ensure sustainable food security through economic empowerment of the small-holder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa.
