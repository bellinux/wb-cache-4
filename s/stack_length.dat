In the range of concentrations studied this precursor forms direct micelles in water.

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is {{the design of}} a {{toroidal}} prime mover. The primary design tool is a MATLAB program based on a standing wave analysis of thermoacoustics. A conventional prime mover that has been well studied, was used for validating the program. DeltaE, a program developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory for designing thermoacoustic engines, was also used as an auxiliary tool for validation test purposes. The validation suggested that the MATLAB program models the onset conditions of a conventional prime mover with fair accuracy. The program was then applied to a toroidal prime mover. A series of analyses were conducted on a toroidal prime mover to determine the influence of prime mover circumference, <b>stack</b> <b>length,</b> and duct radius.

40|$|We {{increase}} the power density of a reverse electrodialysis (RED) stack by blending the low salinity feed {{with a higher}} salinity stream before the stack entrance. This lowers the capital cost {{of the system and}} the resulting levelized cost of electricity, enhancing the viability of RED renewable energy generation. Blending increases the power density by decreasing the dominating electrical resistance in the diluate channel as well as the effective resistance caused by concentration polarization, but not without sacrificing some driving potential. To quantify this trade-off and to evaluate the power density improvement blending can provide, a one-dimensional RED stack model is employed and validated with experimental results from the literature. For a typical stack configured with a feed velocity of 1 cm/s, power density improvements of over 20 % and levelized cost of energy reductions of over 40 % are achievable, provided the salinity of the available river water is below 200 ppm. Additional cost reductions are realized through back-end blending, whereby the diluate exit stream is used as the higher salinity blend stream. Also, improvements from blending increase for higher feed velocities, shorter <b>stack</b> <b>lengths,</b> and larger channel heights.

The station KORH (Figure  3 a), which is located 19.5  km from the source site, shows a clear spectral peak at 10.01  Hz, with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of about 100 in all the components, with a <b>stacking</b> <b>length</b> of 88  days. The signal of the source in FM operation is also seen in the spectrum from 10 to 15  Hz. The station KURN (Figure  3 b), which is located 7.5  km from the source site {{on the other side}} of the summit, shows clear spectral peaks. The SNRs are larger than those at KORH, even though the stacking period is 71  days. The signal at HAR (Figure  3 c), which is located 1.1  km from the source site, has a very good SNR not only because of the distance, but also because of the low-noise environment in the deep borehole. The SNR for a single sinusoid at 10.01  Hz is about 1, 000 for most of the components, and the SNR for the FM signal is about 100. Other spectral peaks, which are typically seen at KORH, are caused by the data telemetry system at the station. Small noise that is synchronized to the GPS clock is generated in the data telemetry system, resulting in spectral peaks with multiples of exactly 1.0  Hz.|$|R

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the effect of an inorganic electrolyte (sodium chloride) on the aggregation behaviour and liquid crystals of Edicol Sunset Yellow. Edicol self-aggregates in aqueous solution to form single molecule stacks, which then become ordered to form nematic and hexagonal (columnar) mesophases at high concentrations. We have employed changes in the 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts to monitor the aggregate formation in solution. A single spectrum is observed at all concentrations because the exchange between Edicol monomers in solution and those in stacks is fast on the NMR time scale. The results show that at low Edicol concentrations (1 wt%) the concentration of aggregates is small, but at high concentrations (20 wt%) the fraction of monomers is tiny. At low Edicol concentrations, low levels of salinity appear to alter aggregate shape and size, resulting in a disaggregation/aggregation effect occurring over four orders of magnitude of added electrolyte. However, little alteration {{is seen in the}} fraction of aggregates. At high electrolyte levels, when the Debye length is comparable to the <b>stack</b> <b>lengths</b> (a few nanometres), the fraction of aggregates increases, presumably because of the reduced intra-stack electrostatic repulsion. Importantly, we have also shown that the isodesmic theory of aggregation (equal K) is too simple to describe accurately the aggregation process from the monomer to the pre-nematic phase concentrations. NMR quadrupole splittings indicate that there is no specific Na+ ion binding to the stacks. At the very highest concentrations of Edicol and sodium chloride the aggregates and mesophases are destabilised. The reason for this has yet to be elucidated...|$|R

Single crystal piezoelectrics such as PMN-PT exhibit very high piezoelectric coefficients (d 33 ~ 1800 to> 2000 pC/N) and electromechanical coupling factors (k 33 > 0. 9), respectively, which may be exploited for improving the performance of broad bandwidth and high frequency sonar. Apart from basic performance, much {{research has been done}} on reducing the size and increasing the output power of tonpilz transducers for sonar applications. Results are presented from two different studies. “ 33 ” mode single crystal tonpilz transducers have reduced <b>stack</b> <b>lengths</b> due to their low elastic stiffness relative to PZTs, however, this produces non-ideal aspect ratios due to large lateral dimensions. Alternative “ 31 ” resonance mode tonpilz elements are proposed to improve performance over these “ 33 ” designs. d 32 values as high as- 1600 pC/N have been observed, and since prestress is applied perpendicular to the poling direction, “ 31 ” mode Tonpilz elements exhibit lower loss and higher reliability than “ 33 ” mode designs. Planar high power tonpilz arrays are the optimum way to obtain the required acoustic pressure and bandwidth for small footprint, high power sensors. An important issue for these sensors is temperature and prestress stability, since fluctuations in tonpilz properties affects power delivery and sensing electronic design.
