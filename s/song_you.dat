25|$|Oh, I'm now {{fully aware}} of the mark Led Zeppelin made on the musical landscape. My {{awareness}} was re-heightened when we were remastering the material to do that CD box set in 1990. When you hear it all, song after <b>song,</b> <b>you</b> realise what a textbook it is for musicians who are coming along, and that's so great. The whole thing is about passing it on, because that's how it was done for me when I was learning from all those old blues and rockabilly records. It's all part of how this cultural phenomenon keeps moving on. I think everyone carries the flame on.|$|E

500|$|According to Biography.com, Good Girl Gone Bad {{inspired}} Rihanna {{to transform}} her image from a [...] "teen pop princess" [...] persona into a [...] "fully fledged superstar and sex symbol". People magazine noted that Rihanna follows {{the likes of}} recording artists Janet Jackson and Christina Aguilera [...] "when she sheds her innocent image for an edgier look and sound". Jay-Z also spoke about [...] "Umbrella" [...] and stated that the song represents an artistic grow for Rihanna, [...] "If {{you listen to the}} lyrics to that <b>song,</b> <b>you</b> know the depth and how far she's come." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{with the}} soundtrack for Watchmen, {{director}} Zack Snyder {{decided to go}} with covers instead of original songs, saying [...] "If you go with the original <b>song,</b> <b>you</b> just get the moment. But if you go with covers you also {{get all of the}} baggage you bring to it, [...] I like the baggage. It kind of resonates and rings across time, it's not just of the moment." [...] The soundtrack was produced by composer Tyler Bates and musical producer Marius de Vries. While Bates' job was initially only writing a musical score and helping the song transitions, the composer ended working closely with de Vries as [...] "the songs and the score just began bleeding into one another" [...] - the only track in which de Vries worked alone was the remix of [...] "Army of Me".|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of the single, in an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Allen said, [...] "It took a while, but it’s done really incredible. It exceeded all my expectations anyway. To be honest, I was a little worried when it first came out and it wasn’t doing great. But I think it’s just about working hard and getting people to hear the song, and then everyone started believing in it a little bit more. I remember getting a text from Keith Urban saying 'I’m not gonna lie: The first time I heard that song I wasn’t crazy about it. But after a couple listens, I really, really like it.' And I mean, I think that’s how everybody felt about the song. And I think that’s a testament to a good <b>song.</b> <b>You</b> don’t have to love ‘em the first time you hear ‘em.

500|$|... "Ghost on the Dance Floor" [...] {{opens the}} album, and is {{specifically}} about [...] "hearing a <b>song</b> <b>you</b> shared with someone that's passed." [...] The track resonated with Barker, who called DeLonge one night because the song affected him {{while listening to}} it, because {{of the death of}} DJ AM. [...] "Natives" [...] first arose from a tribal beat Barker created in the studio, and the song's title changed multiple times before settling on simplicity. [...] "Up All Night" [...] is the album's oldest song, and dates to just after the band's 2009 reunion, when they grouped together and produced demos. The band returned to it multiple times over the recording process, each time making it heavier than before. [...] "After Midnight" [...] was one of four new songs birthed from a last-minute writing session after the band canceled their European tour. Barker's favorite track (and originally titled [...] "Travis Beat") was written in separate studios but composed and recorded together.|$|E
500|$|During Howard's solo concerts from 1983to 1999, [...] "Shivers" [...] was {{the song}} most {{requested}} by audience members. However, {{by the time}} of his final tour in 2009—the year he died—he had stopped receiving requests for it. In an October 2009 interview, Howard commented on his relationship with the song, and its position in his setlists, stating: [...] "I have just tried, perhaps finally successfully, to divorce myself from the song. It's impossible for me to recreate what I was trying to do when I wrote that song so whilst I can see that people have an attachment to it, I don't. I feel like, when I did use to do it in shows, I was doing a cover of some song that had been around forever. That's how it felt. And I guess that is a strange way to feel about a <b>song</b> <b>you</b> wrote, so yeah, I am happy to not have to do it these days".|$|E
500|$|The {{rehearsal}} {{process is}} really understated. It's funny because it's not really needed. It's not needed for us anyway. Because {{we know how}} to play the songs, and the [...] charts don't change the songs structurally at all. But the symphony charts are something that you're not used to hearing. And then the symphony doesn't need the rehearsal because they sight-read. They sight-read better than we could even imagine. So when we get there, they already know how to play our songs better than we do... The purpose of the rehearsal is really, honestly to prepare the band for exactly how powerful the concert is going to be. When the symphony jumps in during those moments where all of a sudden you're singing a <b>song</b> <b>you</b> sing every night and then 30 more musicians start playing, it's so powerful that it causes you to take pause, and you can't take pause. And that's what the rehearsal really is for.|$|E

500|$|McCartney {{said about}} the line [...] "I'd love to turn you on", which concludes both verse sections: [...] "This was the time of Tim Leary's 'Turn on, tune in, drop out' and we wrote, 'I'd love to turn you on.' John and I gave each other a knowing look: 'Uh-huh, it's a drug <b>song.</b> <b>You</b> know that, don't you?'" [...] George Martin commented that he had always {{suspected}} that the line [...] "found my way upstairs and had a smoke" [...] was a drug reference, recalling how the Beatles would [...] "disappear and have a little puff", presumably of marijuana, but {{not in front of}} him. [...] "When [...] was doing his TV programme on Pepper", McCartney recalled later, [...] "he asked me, 'Do you know what caused Pepper?' I said, 'In one word, George, drugs. Pot.' And George said, 'No, no. But you weren't on it all the time.' 'Yes, we were.' Sgt. Pepper was a drug album." ...|$|E
500|$|... "New Guy" [...] {{received}} a mixed response from music critics. Jimmy King from tooXclusive claimed that Sarkodie [...] "killed {{it with his}} trademark fast rap" [...] and concluded with: [...] "'New Guy' is a <b>song</b> <b>you</b> should have on your playlist." [...] Ovie O. from NotJustOk claimed that the track proves that Sarkodie is [...] "better than your best African rapper". KC Roberts from Hip Hop Honesty furthered the praise for the singer having his [...] "own style and sense of deliverability"; he also predicted it {{to be successful in}} the United States and compared it to several songs on American rapper DJ Khaled's second studio album, We the Best (2007). David Mawuli from Pulse awarded the single four out of five stars and declared [...] "New Guy" [...] to be extremely impressive. Multi Media Outfit Luv FM, a radio station in Ghana, reported that [...] "New Guy" [...] was too loud: [...] "It’s either I’m not good at appreciating rap music or Sarkodie’s new song [...] is just noise." [...] She concluded by saying that she does not qualify that as music.|$|E
500|$|Cooder's displeasure {{with the}} Republican Party and its {{financial}} supporters, particularly the Koch Brothers, also inspired his songwriting. He found {{the party to}} be [...] "insanely dangerous" [...] to Barack Obama's presidency and the US, and said of them in an interview for The Guardian, [...] "in case anybody thinks Michele Bachmann or Sarah Palin are clowns because they misspeak or don't know their history or they say silly things: that's just an act, and it's a useful act. Everything is a distraction from the core truths which are, first of all, that corporations have taken over the country." [...] He viewed that his songs for the album provide a more convenient alternative for citizens who do not research politicians, saying that [...] "I don't write books and give speeches but with a four-minute <b>song</b> <b>you</b> can use allegory and other means to suggest {{a different point of}} view. It's like looking around the corner, and that's what songs are good at sometimes. They hit you with a new thought – assuming that people will listen." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Blown Away" [...] {{was directed by}} Randee St. Nicholas and produced by Brandon Bonfiglo for Randee St. Nicholas Photography. Underwood said that when she heard first the song, she already had ideas of a possible video for it, and {{wanted it to be}} a dark Wizard of Oz in 2012. The singer deemed it [...] "a visual <b>song.</b> <b>You</b> listen to it and you can see everything that is happening. It's so dramatic. I'm not a drama person, but when you can make a movie in song form in three-and-a-half minutes, it's surreal." [...] A sneak peek of the video was released on June 11, 2012. The music video premiered worldwide on July 30, during a 24-hour exclusive window domestically and internationally on E! News at 7 and 11:30p.m. ET/PT and on the homepage of E! Online. Prior to the E! premiere, Underwood held a private screening of the video with country radio station KJ97 for over 200 of their listeners in San Antonio, Texas.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Promiscuous" [...] {{describe}} {{the two sides}} of the relationship that the song's protagonist deals with. It was one of the first songs Furtado wrote with labelmate Timothy [...] "Attitude" [...] Clayton. Furtado called their teamwork something she [...] "had never done before" [...] because she saw the writing process as [...] "extremely freeing" [...] because of his different approach and style. Clayton helped Furtado experiment with interpreting the [...] "promiscuous girl" [...] character and the two-sided relationship she is in. Furtado also described that in the process of writing lyrics [...] "we were actually flirting, which is why the song is so playful" [...] and that she and Clayton nicknamed the song 'The BlackBerry Song', because everything we say in the <b>song</b> <b>you</b> could text-message to somebody". Because of the preponderant musical influence of artists such as Talking Heads, Blondie, Madonna, The Police and Eurythmics, whom producers Timbaland and Danja listened to during the writing of the album, [...] "Promiscuous" [...] takes inspiration from pop music of the 1980s. The sexuality was based on the [...] "strong women in control" [...] of the 1990s, such as Queen Latifah, MC Lyte, Yo-Yo, Salt-n-Pepa and TLC.|$|E
500|$|... "Night of Your Life" [...] {{was written}} by Cristyle Johnson, Anthony Preston, David Guetta and Giorgio Tuinfort, whilst {{production}} of the song was helmed by Guetta and Tuinfort. In an interview with Akshay Bhansali of MTV News, Guetta revealed {{that he did not}} know Hudson before collaborating on the song, saying, [...] "I had heard her voice [...] and I fell in love with it. It's a difficult <b>song.</b> <b>You</b> need a really big voice to be able to perform that song. I was like, 'Whoa!' She obviously has an amazing voice, and I think it was a really interesting exercise for her and for me." [...] Guetta further explained that when he collaborates with artists, he likes to [...] "take them out of their boxes", and creating a dance record with Hudson was [...] "really exciting" [...] for him. On working with Hudson, he said, [...] "She is beautiful in every way: as a person, as a singer, as a human being. She delivered [...] like crazy." [...] "Night of Your Life" [...] was released for digital download on August 22, 2011, as the third and final promotional single from the album, as part of the iTunes Store's countdown to the album's release.|$|E

500|$|As they {{completed}} the song's demo, Tommy Mottola, CEO of Sony Music Entertainment and Carey's fiancé, {{walked into the}} studio. After hearing the rough version of the song, on which they were still working on, he became interested in it, asking what project the song belonged to. Carey explained to him the concept and how the song {{would be used for}} the film Hero. Mottola immediately took an intense liking to the song, responding, [...] "Are you kidding me? You can't give this song to this movie. This is too good. Mariah, you have to take this <b>song.</b> <b>You</b> have to do it." [...] Initially, Carey was guided by the subject of the film, but Afanasieff acknowledged that she made it a very personal song after deciding to keep it, altering some of the lyrics, key and instrumentation.

500|$|Following the album's release, Charles quickly {{earned an}} influx of white {{listeners}} and audiences at concert venues, without experiencing any fall-out from his predominantly black audience. Writer Daniel Cooper later said of the album's effect, [...] "It's an idea as corny as any country <b>song</b> <b>you</b> can think of, and one that Charles knew to be true; music unites people. It just really does." [...] Throughout the years following its initial reception, Modern Sounds gained further acknowledgment of {{its impact on the}} music industry and society. Through conceiving and recording the album, Charles {{became one of the first}} African-American musicians to receive and practice artistic control bestowed upon by a mainstream record company. In a 1998 interview, country musician Raul Malo acknowledged the album's influence, calling it [...] "one of the most important records of our time, not only because of its content, but also due to its social and political ramifications." [...] In a July 8, 2004 article for Rolling Stone magazine, music journalist Robert Christgau praised the impact and influence that the Modern Sounds recordings had on music, stating [...] "In the world it created, not only could a black person sing the American songbook Ella Fitzgerald owned by then, but a country black person could take it over. Soon Charles's down-home diction, cotton-field grit, corn-pone humor and overstated shows of emotion were standard operating procedure in American music, black and white." ...|$|E
