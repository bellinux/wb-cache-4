40|$|Introduction With digital {{radiography}} (DR), radiographers receive immediate feedback on detector exposure {{in the form}} of the exposure index (EI). Purpose To identify whether radiographers were meeting the manufacturer-recommended EI (MREI) value ranges for routine chest, abdomen and pelvis X-ray examinations under a variety of conditions and to examine factors that impacted upon EI levels. Methods Data on 5000 adult X-ray examinations were collected, including: EI values, examination parameters, patients’ gender, dates of birth, dates and times of examinations, grid usages and the presence of metallic implants or prostheses. Descriptive statistics were used to summarise data sets and Mann–Whitney U testing was performed to establish causal agents for EI value variations. Results EI values were often outside the MREI ranges. EI value variations were identified, with significantly higher EI values recorded for female compared with male patients for all manufacturers (P ≤ 0. 04), indicating higher detector exposures except for Philips direct {{digital radiography}} (DDR), where increased EI values indicated lower exposures (P= 0. 01). Higher EI values were also noted for the following variables: out of hours radiography (P ≤ 0. 02), the absence of <b>secondary</b> <b>radiation</b> <b>grids</b> with Philips DDR chest X-rays (P = 0. 03), younger patients with Siemens DDR chest X-rays (P < 0. 0001) and higher kVp for Carestream computed radiography (CR) chest X-rays (P = 0. 02). Significantly lower median EI values were demonstrated for Carestream CR chest X-rays when a metallic implant or prosthesis was present (P = 0. 02). Discussion Non adherence to MREIs has been demonstrated. EI value discrepancies have been identified as being dependent on patient gender, time/day of exposure, grid usage, the presence of a metallic implants or prostheses, patient age and use of ≥ 100 kVp. The value of careful retrospective evaluation of EI databases has been highlighted. Access is restricted to staff and students of the University of Sydney. UniKey credentials are required.

40|$|NASA's {{exploration}} {{goals are}} focused on deep space travel and Mars surface operations. To accomplish these goals, large structures {{will be necessary to}} transport crew and logistics in the initial stages, and NASA will need to keep the crew and the vehicle safe during transport and any surface activities. One of the major challenges of deep space travel is the space radiation environment and its impacts on the crew, the electronics, and the vehicle materials. The primary radiation from the sun (solar particle events) and from outside the solar system (galactic cosmic rays) interact with materials of the vehicle. These interactions lead to some of the primary radiation being absorbed, being modified, or producing <b>secondary</b> <b>radiation</b> (primarily neutrons). With all vehicles, the high energy primary radiation is of most concern. However, with larger vehicles that have large shielding masses, there is more opportunity for <b>secondary</b> <b>radiation</b> production, and this <b>secondary</b> <b>radiation</b> can be significant enough to cause concern. When considering surface operations, there is also a <b>secondary</b> <b>radiation</b> source {{from the surface of the}} planet, known as albedo, with neutrons being one of the most significant species. Given new vehicle designs for deep space and Mars missions, the <b>secondary</b> <b>radiation</b> environment and the implications of that environment is currently not well understood. Thus, several studies are necessary to fill the knowledge gaps of this <b>secondary</b> <b>radiation</b> environment. In this paper, we put forth the initial steps to increasing our understanding of neutron production from large vehicles by comparing the neutron production resulting from our radiation transport codes and providing a preliminary validation of our results against flight data. This paper will review the details of these results and discuss the finer points of the analysis...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{work is a}} {{feasibility}} study of a radiation treatment unit with laser-driven protons based on a state-of-the-art energy selection system employing four dipole magnets in a compact shielded beamline. The <b>secondary</b> <b>radiation</b> emitted from the beamline and its energy selection system and the resulting effective dose to the patient are assessed. Further, it is evaluated whether or not such a compact system could be operated in a conventional treatment vault for clinical linear accelerators under the constraint of not exceeding the effective dose limit of 1 mSv per year {{to the general public}} outside the treatment room. The Monte Carlo code Geant 4 is employed to simulate the <b>secondary</b> <b>radiation</b> generated while irradiating a hypothetical tumor. The <b>secondary</b> <b>radiation</b> inevitably generated inside the patient is taken into account as well, serving as a lower limit. The results show that the <b>secondary</b> <b>radiation</b> emanating from the shielded compact therapy system would pose a serious secondary dose contamination to the patient. This is due to the broad energy spectrum and in particular the angular distribution of the laser-driven protons, which make the investigated beamline together with the employed energy selection system quite inefficient. The <b>secondary</b> <b>radiation</b> also cannot be sufficiently absorbed in a conventional linear accelerator treatment vault to enable a clinical operation. A promising result, however, {{is the fact that the}} <b>secondary</b> <b>radiation</b> generated in the patient alone could be very well shielded by a regular treatment vault, allowing the application of more than 100 fractions of 2 Gy per day with protons. It is thus theoretically possible to treat patients with protons in such treatment vaults. Nevertheless, the results show that there is a clear need for alternative more efficient energy selection solutions for laser-driven protons...|$|R

50|$|Material {{shielding}} {{can be effective}} against galactic cosmic rays, but thin shielding may actually make the problem worse {{for some of the}} higher energy rays, because more shielding causes an increased amount of <b>secondary</b> <b>radiation,</b> although thick shielding could counter such too. The aluminium walls of the ISS, for example, are believed to produce a net reduction in radiation exposure. In interplanetary space, however, it is believed that thin aluminium shielding would give a net increase in radiation exposure but would gradually decrease as more shielding is added to capture generated <b>secondary</b> <b>radiation.</b>|$|R

40|$|Electromagnetic waves {{can be used}} to {{transmit}} information over long distances and are therefore often employed for communication purposes. The electromagnetic waves are reflected off material objects on their paths and interact with the medium through which they propagate. For instance, the plasma in the ionosphere can refract and even reflect radio waves propagating through it. By increasing the power of radio waves injected into the ionosphere, the waves start to modify the plasma, resulting in the generation {{of a wide range of}} nonlinear processes, including turbulence, in particular near the reflection region. By systematically varying the injected radio waves in terms of frequency, power, polarisation, duty cycle, inclination, etc. the ionosphere can be used as an outdoor laboratory for investigating fundamental properties of the near-Earth space environment as well as of plasma turbulence. In such ionospheric modification experiments, it has been discovered that the irradiation of the ionosphere by powerful radio waves leads to the formation of plasma density structures and to the emission of <b>secondary</b> electromagnetic <b>radiation,</b> a phenomenon known as stimulated electromagnetic emission. These processes are highly repeatable and have enabled systematic investigations of the nonlinear properties of the ionospheric plasma. In this thesis we investigate features of the plasma density structures and the <b>secondary</b> electromagnetic <b>radiation.</b> In a theoretical study we analyse a certain aspect of the formation of the plasma structures. The transient dynamics of the <b>secondary</b> <b>radiation</b> is investigated experimentally in a series of papers, focussing on the initial stage as well as on the decay. In one of the papers we use the transient dynamics of the <b>secondary</b> <b>radiation</b> to reveal the intimate relation between certain features of the radiation and structures of certain scales.

Sacrifices were performed after 4, 7, 14, 21, 56 and 84 postoperative days and both tibiae were removed for histological processing. RESULTS: The left tibiae that received the dose of 7 Gy has shown more bone neoformation from 14 th postoperative days, giving evidences of less damage to cellular population responsible by bone neoformation. On the other hand, the dose of 30 Gyon right tibiae did not exhibit significant differences among the periods, suggesting damage of long-lasting or even permanent duration.

40|$|National audienceOne of the {{advantages}} of hadrontherapy with respect to conventional radiotherapy {{is the fact that the}} ions deposit a large quantity of their dose at the end of their path in the Bragg peak, which allows a maximization of the dose applied to the tumor and a minimization of the dose in healthy tissues. The lateral dose distribution is also quite narrow. Another advantage is the higher relative biological effectiveness. Due to the sharp falloff, one of the major issues for quality control during the treatment with ion beams is the control of the Bragg peak position and its conformation to the tumor volume. A mispositioning would either lead to an over-dosage of healthy tissue and/or an under-dosage in the target volume. Since no primary radiation is emerging from the patient during treatment, <b>secondary</b> <b>radiation</b> is used for in vivo monitoring purposes. The <b>secondary</b> <b>radiation</b> needs to have a weak interaction probability inside the patient to reach external detectors and it needs to be correlated to the primary beam dose distribution. This information on electromagnetic energy distribution (the LET) can be extracted from nuclear interactions. Several types of <b>secondary</b> <b>radiations</b> are being investigated in the LabEx PRIMES: (i) the detection of the two 511 keV gammas following a beta+ decay via a PET scanner, (ii) prompt <b>secondary</b> <b>radiation</b> following inelastic nuclear interactions, either prompt gamma rays via a collimated gamma or Compton camera, or light charged particles via second proton vertex imaging. Another quality assurance issue prior to the irradiation is under investigation in the LabEx: proton radiography and computed tomography (CT). This could improve proton therapy compared to current clinical practice since it could reduce the uncertainty of the proton therapy planning due to the lack of accuracy in the proton stopping power of tissues computed from photon CT images.
