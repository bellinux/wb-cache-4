The function to be integrated may be a scalar field or a vector field. The value of the <b>surface</b> <b>integral</b> is the sum of the field at all points on the surface.

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} with analytical integration of trivariate polynomials over linear polyhedra in Euclidean three-dimensional space. The volume integration of trivariate polynomials over linear polyhedra is computed as sum of <b>surface</b> <b>integrals</b> in â 3 on {{application of the}} well known Gauss's divergence theorem and by using triangulation of the linear polyhedral boundary. The <b>surface</b> <b>integrals</b> in â 3 over an arbitrary triangle are connected to <b>surface</b> <b>integrals</b> of bivariate polynomials in â 2. The <b>surface</b> <b>integrals</b> in â 2 over a simple polygon or over an arbitrary triangle are computed by two different approaches. The first algorithm is obtained by transforming the <b>surface</b> <b>integrals</b> in â 2 into a sum of line integrals in a one-parameter space, while the second algorithm is obtained by transforming the <b>surface</b> <b>integrals</b> in â 2 over an arbitrary triangle into a parametric double integral over a unit triangle. It is shown that the volume integration of trivariate polynomials over linear polyhedra can be obtained as a sum of <b>surface</b> <b>integrals</b> of bivariate polynomials in â 2. The computation of <b>surface</b> <b>integrals</b> is proposed {{in the beginning of}} this paper and these are contained in Lemmas 1 - 6. These algorithms (Lemmas 1 - 6) and the theorem on volume integration are then followed by an example for which the detailed computational scheme has been explained. The symbolic integration formulas presented in this paper may lead to an easy and systematic incorporation of global properties of solid objects, for example, the volume, centre of mass, moments of inertia etc., required in engineering design processes.

25|$|The <b>surface</b> <b>integral</b> of the Gaussian {{curvature}} {{over some}} region of a surface {{is called the}} total curvature. The total curvature of a geodesic triangle equals the deviation of {{the sum of its}} angles from π. The sum of the angles of a triangle on a surface of positive curvature will exceed π, while the sum of the angles of a triangle on a surface of negative curvature will be less than π. On a surface of zero curvature, such as the Euclidean plane, the angles will sum to precisely π radians.|$|E
25|$|The {{direction}} of the curl is the axis of rotation, {{as determined by the}} right-hand rule, and the magnitude of the curl is the magnitude of rotation. If the vector field represents the flow velocity of a moving fluid, then the curl is the circulation density of the fluid. A vector field whose curl is zero is called irrotational. The curl is a form of differentiation for vector fields. The corresponding form of the fundamental theorem of calculus is Stokes' theorem, which relates the <b>surface</b> <b>integral</b> of the curl of a vector field to the line integral of the vector field around the boundary curve.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{systematic}} {{treatment of}} the three-dimensional Poisson equation via singular and hypersingular boundary integral equation techniques is investigated {{in the context of}} a Galerkin approximation. Developed to conveniently deal with domain integrals without a volume-fitted mesh, the proposed method initially converts domain integrals featuring the Newton potential and its gradient into equivalent <b>surface</b> <b>integrals.</b> Then, the resulting boundary integrals are evaluated by means of well-established cubature methods. In this transformation, weakly-singular domain integrals, defined over simply- or multiply-connected domains with Lipschitz boundaries, are rigorously converted into weakly-singular <b>surface</b> <b>integrals.</b> Combined with the semi-analytic integration approach developed for potential problems to accurately calculate singular and hypersingular Galerkin <b>surface</b> <b>integrals,</b> this technique can be employed to effectively deal with mixed boundary-value problems without the need to partition the underlying domain into volume cells.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with explicit integration formulas and algorithms for computing volume integrals of trivariate polynomials over an arbitrary linear hexahedron in Euclidean three-dimensional space. Three different approaches are discussed. The first algorithm is obtained by transforming a volume integral into a sum of <b>surface</b> <b>integrals</b> and then into convenient and computationally efficient line integrals. The second algorithm is obtained by transforming a volume integral into a sum of <b>surface</b> <b>integrals</b> over the boundary quadrilaterals. The third algorithm is obtained by transforming a volume integral into a sum of <b>surface</b> <b>integrals</b> over the triangulation of boundary. These algorithms and finite integration formulas are then followed by an application example, for which we have explained the detailed computational scheme. The symbolic finite integration formulas {{presented in this paper}} may lead to efficient and easy incorporation of integral properties of arbitrary linear polyhedra required in the engineering design process.
