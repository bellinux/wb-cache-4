He does not say much more, because he is not <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> the particles are related to the wave.

5|$|Elves {{appear in}} some place-names, {{though it is}} hard to be <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> many as a variety of other words, {{including}} personal names, can appear similar to elf. The clearest English example is Elveden ("elves' hill", Suffolk); other examples may be Eldon Hill ("Elves' hill", Derbyshire); and Alden Valley ("elves' valley", Lancashire). These seem to associate elves fairly consistently with woods and valleys.|$|E
5|$|The State Bank was not <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> much it {{actually}} lost from the robbery, {{but the best}} estimates were around 341,000 rubles, worth around 3.4million US dollars as of 2008. About 91,000 rubles were in small untraceable bills, with the rest in large 500-ruble notes that were difficult to exchange because their serial numbers were known to the police.|$|E

5|$|An inquest into Lynott's {{death was}} held at Birmingham Coroner's Court in January 2003. The hearing was told that marks found {{on her back and}} an arm may have been bruising, but the {{pathologist}} who conducted the original post mortem could not be <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> she had died, because her body had lain undiscovered for up to seven days. It was also said that, despite her connection with Smith, police and four pathologists had failed to establish that Lynott had been murdered. The inquest jury returned an open verdict.|$|E
5|$|Beagle was {{not allowed}} to land at Tenerife through fears that those aboard would bring cholera, but the ship {{proceeded}} to Cape Verde, Fernando de Noronha and Rio de Janeiro. She then spent some time surveying the coast of South America south from Rio de Janeiro, around Tierra del Fuego, the coast of Chile and as far north as Peru. Fitz-Roy finally detached Beagle from South America in August 1835. The Admiralty had not precisely specified his itinerary across the Pacific since they could not be <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> far north {{he would be able to}} survey in the time available, and hence precisely where he would be leaving from. But they did specify that he should stop at Tahiti, a point of previously well-determined longitude. The Admiralty also required that, like the journey across the Atlantic, it should be done in small stages to frequently rate the chronometers. Fitz-Roy chose to go via the Galápagos Islands. Subsequently Beagle visited Tahiti, New Zealand, Australia and Mauritius.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of release}} schedules—especially {{in the case}} of films {{released}} {{towards the end of the}} year—and different release patterns across the world, many films can do business in two or more calendar years; therefore the grosses documented here are not confined to just the year of release. Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained. At least one film every year has generated $100 million in gross revenue at the box office since 1967, and from 2008 each year has succeeded in producing a billion dollar grossing film.|$|E

Joneses isn't a downer, though, and director Sam Gold and his excellent cast ensure that its humor and poignance are equally served.

5|$|Henry Henniger, the {{president}} of Kennywood Entertainment Company, wanted a large steel coaster in the late 1980s. The park had only built wooden roller coasters in the past. The park also had a very tight layout {{and they were not}} <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> to fit it into the park. On July 27, 1990, Kennywood announced the name of their new roller coaster would be Steel Phantom and it would use the same station as Laser Loop, which it replaced. The ride opened on May 10, 1991 as the fastest and steepest steel roller coaster in the world. The inversions were a vertical loop, a Boomerang, and a corkscrew. As a result of the inversions, riders experienced more-than-usual head banging. Shortly after its debut, a trim brake was added because the coaster was going faster than it should through the inversions and riders were experiencing pain in their necks.|$|E
5|$|In mid-2014, {{having just}} {{finished}} their previous collaboration, Fatale, Brubaker and artist Sean Phillips were deliberating whether their next project {{would be a}} noir period piece or a science fiction tale. Brubaker did not think a noir set in 1940s Hollywood was commercial enough to be accepted through normal channels, but the timing aligned with their five-year exclusive contract with Image Comics. This contract guaranteed that the creators could publish any comic without having to pitch it to the publisher first. The pair announced The Fade Out and their new contract on January 9, 2014, at Image Expo. At the time, no length was given for the series {{because they were not}} <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> many issues were needed to tell the story. Since Fatale had taken twice as long as originally planned, {{they did not want to}} mislead fans or feel pressure to conclude before they were ready. They did know it would be a minimum of 12 issues.|$|E
5|$|Mike Walsh {{was worried}} about filming the moment when a beam breaks inside the Luthor mansion, from the wind {{generated}} by the storm, and lands on top of Lionel. His crew already knew which beam was going to fall, {{but they did not}} know where to cut the beam because they were not <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> Beeman intended to shoot the scene. When the day of shooting came around everything worked out well. They used a stunt double for the initial impact of the beam, and then John Glover stepped back into the scene and fell down with the beam on top of him. The wind effects also created potential danger for the cast and crew. As Eric Johnson recalls, even the smallest piece of debris flying around at such high speeds can cause damage. Annette O’Toole had a similar experience for her scenes in the storm cellar. When Jonathan races into the storm after Nixon, the special effects crew used one of their jet fans and some dry leaves to simulate the winds that were coming from outside; the dry leaves were smacking O’Toole in the face, smothering her.|$|E

25|$|The State Bank was not <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> much it {{actually}} lost from the robbery, {{but the best}} estimates were that around 341,000 rubles were stolen, worth approximately $3.4million in 2008 United States Dollars. Of the 341,000 in rubles taken, about 91,000 were in small untraceable bills, but around 250,000 rubles were in large 500-ruble notes with serial numbers known to the police.

25|$|Concurrent {{with the}} sonar readings, the {{floodlit}} camera obtained {{a pair of}} underwater photographs. Both depicted {{what appeared to be}} a rhomboid flipper, although sceptics have dismissed the images as the bottom of the loch, air bubbles, a rock, or a fish fin. The apparent flipper was photographed in different positions, indicating movement. The first flipper photo is better-known than the second, and both were enhanced and retouched from the original negatives. According to team member Charles Wyckoff, the photos were retouched to superimpose the flipper; the original enhancement showed a considerably less-distinct object. No one is <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> the originals were altered.|$|E

25|$|Landlords were {{responsible}} for paying the rates of every tenant whose yearly rent was £4 or less. Landlords whose land was crowded with poorer tenants were now faced with large bills. Many began clearing the poor tenants from their small plots, and letting the land in larger plots for over £4 which then reduced their debts. In 1846, {{there had been some}} clearances, but the great mass of evictions came in 1847. According to James S. Donnelly, Jr., it is impossible to be <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> many people were evicted during the years of the famine and its immediate aftermath. It was only in 1849 that the police began to keep a count, and they recorded a total of almost 250,000 persons as officially evicted between 1849 and 1854.|$|E

25|$|Several {{desirable}} control methods are currently ineffective for various reasons. Zinc phosphide {{is the only}} rodenticide currently registered to control nutria, but it is expensive, remains toxic for months, detoxifies in high humidity and rain, and requires construction of (expensive) floating rafts for placement of the chemical. It is not yet <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> many nontarget species are susceptible to zinc phosphide, but birds and rabbits {{have been known to}} die from ingestion. Therefore, this chemical is rarely used, especially not in large-scale projects. Other potential chemical pesticides would be required by the US Environmental Protection Agency to undergo vigorous testing before they could be acceptable to use on nutria. The LDWF has estimated costs for new chemicals to be $300,000 for laboratory, chemistry, and field studies, and $500,000 for a mandatory Environmental Impact Statement.|$|E
25|$|Yuma is {{the main}} protagonist of the story, and is in her second {{year of high school}} along with her best friend Hotaru. When she finds her first boyfriend (Takeda) she is not <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> to react so she asks Hotaru for advice. Yuma is {{surprised}} though when it appears as if her friend is flirting with her. She cannot explain the good feeling she gets when she French kisses Hotaru or when she gets fondled, and worries that Takeda will catch her in the act. In the second volume he decides that the two should take some space apart, and Yuma comes to terms that she is in fact cheating with Hotaru. Her feelings still remain conflicted though as she does not want to hurt him so she remains as a friend. Yuma finally confesses to Hotaru in the fifth manga volume that she has feelings towards her but is rejected. She then turns to Takeda after feeling like she had been used the entire time by her.|$|E
25|$|Bette {{was now a}} very driven and {{somewhat}} spoiled Los Angeles debutante and tennis prodigy. After seeing Robin on the news, Bette vowed that she would gain his attention and favor by becoming a masked adventurer herself. Training to Olympic-levels in gymnastics and martial arts, she created the identity of Flamebird (and a costume that resembled her pre-Crisis Bat-Girl identity) and joined Titans West in hopes of catching Robin's eye. While flattered, the driven young hero was not <b>sure</b> <b>how</b> {{to deal with her}} obsession and avoided her, much to her dismay. After briefly giving up her heroic persona, Bette found that neither winning tennis tournaments nor achieving perfect grades in school matched the rooftop thrills of the hero biz. She attempted several times to reunite the Titans West team, most notably after a journey into the afterlife with Hawk and Dove, but was unsuccessful. Dove noted that Bette was essentially a very lonely person, basically desperate for company and contact with others. Bette again gave up her obsession with the Titans until malfunctioning former Titan Victor Stone collected her, along with all former Titans everywhere, in an attempt to protect his soul from the Justice League. Hoping this would lead to a formal invitation to rejoin the team, Bette was crushed to learn they did not need (or want) her assistance.|$|E

40|$|A new {{framework}} {{referred to}} as the mean impact curve (MIC), is used to model and test for nonlinear mean reversion in stock returns. The MIC mea- <b>sures</b> <b>how</b> news is incorporated into the conditional mean of asset returns, thereby providing an extension of the news impact curve of Engle and Ng (1993) which measures the relationship between news and conditional volatility. An explicit parametric specification of the MIC is derived from a model where investors follow heterogeneous trading strategies. The empirical results show strong evidence of significant nonlinearities in the Finnish stock index and some of its components. The shape of the MIC for these stocks shows that there is mean aversion in the conditional mean for small shocks, but mean reversion for large shocks...|$|R
