60|$|The {{stranger}} {{did look}} very shy. She {{was a slight}} creature, not yet seventeen, with an abundant mass of long golden <b>silk</b> <b>hair</b> tied loosely, and a very lovely face and complexion, so small {{that she was a}} miniature edition of Lady Ivinghoe.|$|E
60|$|The burglar softly {{opened the}} door of the lighted room. The gas was turned low. A man lay in the bed asleep. On the dresser lay many things in confusion--a {{crumpled}} roll of bills, a watch, keys, three poker chips, crushed cigars, a pink <b>silk</b> <b>hair</b> bow, and an unopened bottle of bromo-seltzer for a bulwark in the morning.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{look as if}} {{you were}} meant to be put under a glass case!" [...] said Ethel, {{surveying}} the little elegant figure, whose great characteristic was a look of exquisite finish, not only in the features and colouring, the turn of the head, and the shape of the small rosy-tipped fingers, but in everything she wore, from the braids of black <b>silk</b> <b>hair,</b> to the little shoe on her foot, and even in the very lightness and gaiety of her movements.|$|E

50|$|Animal fibers consist {{largely of}} {{particular}} proteins. Instances are silkworm silk, spider silk, sinew, catgut, wool, sea <b>silk</b> and <b>hair</b> such as cashmere wool, mohair and angora, fur such as sheepskin, rabbit, mink, fox, beaver, etc.|$|R
50|$|Of {{industrial}} value {{are four}} animal fibers, wool, <b>silk,</b> camel <b>hair,</b> and angora {{as well as}} four plant fibers, cotton, flax, hemp, and jute. Dominant in terms of scale of production and use is cotton for textiles.|$|R
60|$|He was silent. His {{silence was}} {{positively}} noisy. He {{wanted her to}} hear it. But {{it is difficult to}} be sulky with a bland, plump woman of thirty who remembers your childhood trick of biting your nails, and glances up at you from her embroidery, occasionally patting her brown <b>silk</b> <b>hair</b> or smoothing her brown silk waist in a way which implies a good digestion, a perfect memory of the morning's lesson of her Sunday-school class, and a mild disbelief in men as anything except relatives, providers, card-players, and nurslings. Carl gave up the silence-cure.|$|E

50|$|The Khamti tie {{their hair}} into a large knot, which is {{supported}} by a white turban (Fa-ho). The chiefs wear a long coat made of <b>silk.</b> The <b>hair</b> is drawn up from the back and sides in one massive roll, measuring four to five inches in length. An embroidered band, the fringed and tasseled ends of which hang down behind, encircles the roll.|$|R
5000|$|Hina dolls are {{the dolls}} for Hinamatsuri, the doll festival on March 3. They {{can be made}} of many {{materials}} but the classic hina doll has a pyramidal body of elaborate, many-layered textiles stuffed with straw and/or wood blocks, carved wood hands (and in some cases feet) covered with gofun, and a head of carved wood or molded wood compo covered with gofun, with set-in glass eyes (though before about 1850 the eyes were carved into the gofun and painted) and human or <b>silk</b> <b>hair.</b> A full set comprises at least 15 dolls, representing specific characters, with many accessories (dogu), though the basic set is a male-female pair, {{often referred to as}} the Emperor and Empress.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on {{the leaves}} of Pistia stratiotes, Salvinia rotundifolia, Azolla caroliniana, and {{occasionally}} Eichhornia crassipes and Lemna species. They often feed inside a shelter formed of <b>silk</b> and <b>hairs,</b> although {{this is not always}} present. Young larvae are dirty-white to pale yellow. They become yellow-green when full-grown. Pupation takes place within a silk cocoon in the inflated leaf petioles.|$|R

5000|$|... "Rockseer elves are {{the rarest}} of all elvenkind. They are far taller {{than most of}} their kin, with a few {{reaching}} almost to eight feet in height. An average weight for a Rockseer is between 120 and 140 pounds, with little gender difference. Rockseers are very pale skinned, {{and they have no}} body hair. Head hair is extraordinarily fine, always worn long, with the appearance and texture of exquisitely fine <b>silk.</b> The <b>hair</b> is silver, and eye color is a pale, almost ice-blue. They are androgynous in appearance, making it difficult for outsiders to tell males and females apart.|$|R
50|$|Biological fibers {{also known}} as fibrous {{proteins}} or protein filaments consist largely of biologically relevant and biologically very important proteins, mutations or other genetic defects can lead to severe diseases. Instances are collagen family of proteins, tendon, muscle proteins like actin, cell proteins like microtubules and many others, spider <b>silk,</b> sinew and <b>hair</b> etc.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on lichens. They are {{grey and}} black, with orange {{spots on the}} sides and yellow {{speckles}} {{on the back and}} underside. There are two pale yellow lines running along the back. Pupation takes place in a sparse cocoon made of <b>silk</b> and larval <b>hairs</b> which is attached to a tree or wall.|$|R
40|$|This paper reports {{research}} {{undertaken to}} investigate thread types used in textile conservation by quantitatively evaluating tensile strength and damage to conserved samples. A literature review and questionnaire sent to textile conservators {{were used to}} establish {{the most commonly used}} threads for laid-thread couching treatments and the rationale behind thread choice. Most common threads found were two-ply <b>hair</b> <b>silk</b> and polyester Tetex as well as other fine polyester, silk and cotton varieties. Three natural fibre plain-weave artefact samples conserved by laid-thread couching with five different thread types (lace cotton, <b>hair</b> <b>silk,</b> organsin, Skala and Tetex) were subjected to either tensile strength testing or a fixed-load experiment for two weeks. The tensile strength tests determined that the conservation treatment provided effective support and different thread types did not give statistically different results. The fixed-load experiment determined that longer time periods created more damage, even with lighter loads...|$|R
50|$|Loose, braided, tied lovingly in <b>silk</b> ribbons, <b>hair</b> was memorialized {{especially}} by the Victorians. Often, hair would be encased within a glass or woven with metallic threads, {{paired with a}} metal setting to be worn as mourning jewelry, a memento of a friend or loved one. Hairwork, an art still practiced today by the Victorian Hairwork Society, was a popular needlework method, often resulting in 2-dimensional mourning wreaths and graveyard scenes, worked in hair on a fabric ground. Wool, because {{of its ability to}} wick moisture and resist flame, was commonly used in Western textiles throughout history, and might present itself in the form of bedlinens, clothing, and needlework.|$|R
50|$|Nests {{are small}} and cup-shaped, 5-6 cm {{diameter}} and similar depth. These are skilfully woven from grasses, bound with spiderâ€™s <b>silk,</b> animal <b>hair</b> or wool; and can include feathers and plant material. The female appears {{to be responsible for}} construction but both sexes maintain and make repairs. Nests are usually located among the foliage in crowns of trees or shrubs, and only rarely seen in mistletoe. Sometimes nests are constructed in forks or on branches, and rarely in dead foliage. There is some evidence of site fidelity, and nest trees may be shared with active nests maintained by several other species including wagtails, magpie-lark, woodswallows and other honeyeater species.|$|R
50|$|The females deposit {{eggs into}} the opened thistle flowerheads. The young larvae start feeding on the achenes of thistles (mainly Cirsium and Carduus species), {{but they do}} not induce gall-forming. They develop in the flower-heads (capitulum) of thistles in a cocoon of <b>silk</b> and plant <b>hairs</b> (pappus). This {{univoltine}} species overwinters in the larval stage. Adults are on the wing from July to September.|$|R

40|$|Keynote lectureThe micro/nano-structural {{evolution}} {{before and}} after tensile/compressive loading, fatigue and ultimately, failure has been studied by Raman (and IR) microspectroscopy for PBO, PET, PA 66, PP, <b>silk</b> and <b>hair</b> using three probes: low wavenumber collective modes at < 150 cm- 1 as representative of the crystalline/ordered and amorphous chains, stretching and bending modes, as representative of the C-C/ C-N polymeric backbone, and localized vibrations (OH, NH) to probe the inter-macromolecule segment distance. Wavenumber and bandwidth distribution across fibre diameters reveal different types of skin/core heterogeneity. The in situ analysis at different strain/pressure levels shows that amorphous chains in the fibre accommodate the stress differently. The post mortem analysis shows that amorphous domains can be higly stressed during the failure and remnant stress can be measured...|$|R

50|$|Protein yarns (i.e., <b>hair,</b> <b>silk,</b> feathers) {{may also}} be irritating to some people, causing contact dermatitis, hives, wheezing, or other reactions. Plant fibers tend to be better tolerated by people with sensitivities to the protein yarns, and allergists may suggest using them or {{synthetics}} instead to prevent symptoms. Some people find that they can tolerate organically grown and processed versions of protein fibers, possibly because organic processing standards preclude the use of chemicals that may irritate the skin.|$|R

5000|$|Textile {{conservation}} {{is limited to}} the following types of textiles: the natural fibers of animal and plants. Textile can be made of wool, <b>hair,</b> <b>silk,</b> cotton, flax, jute, hemp, nettle, among others. Textiles that are made with the fibers of animals are primarily composed of protein, making it more resistant to decompose, compared to plant fibers that are primarily composed with cellulose. Light, insects, micro-organisms and pollution can cause textiles to deteriorate; making it lose strength and pliability. The normal exposure of the atmospheric conditions can cause textiles to weaken and disintegrate ...|$|R
60|$|She {{was still}} in her dinner-gown of black satin, but it was soaked through with the rain and hung about her like a black shroud.

50|$|Common {{natural fibres}} for rope are manila hemp, hemp, feathers, linen, cotton, coir, jute, straw, and sisal. Synthetic fibres in use for rope-making include polypropylene, nylon, polyesters (e.g. PET, LCP, Vectran), {{polyethylene}} (e.g. Dyneema and Spectra), Aramids (e.g. Twaron, Technora and Kevlar) and acrylics (e.g. Dralon). Some ropes are constructed of mixtures of several fibres or use co-polymer fibres. Wire rope {{is made of}} steel or other metal alloys. Ropes have been constructed of other fibrous materials such as <b>silk,</b> wool, and <b>hair,</b> but such ropes are not generally available. Rayon is a regenerated fibre used to make decorative rope.|$|R
