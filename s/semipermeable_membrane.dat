First {{synthesized}} in 1963 from simple minerals and basic organics while exposed to sunlight, it is still reported to have some metabolic capabilities, the presence of <b>semipermeable</b> <b>membrane,</b> amino acids, phospholipids, carbohydrates and RNA-like molecules.

25|$|As {{support for}} the lipid bilayer {{membrane}} theory grew, this alternative concept was developed which denied {{the importance of the}} lipid bilayer membrane. Procter & Wilson (1916) demonstrated that gels, which do not have a <b>semipermeable</b> <b>membrane,</b> would swell in dilute solutions. Loeb (1920) also studied gelatin extensively, with and without a membrane, showing that more of the properties attributed to the plasma membrane could be duplicated in gels without a membrane. In particular, he found that an electrical potential difference between the gelatin and the outside medium could be developed, based on the H+ concentration.|$|E
25|$|The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is {{a highly}} {{selective}} <b>semipermeable</b> <b>membrane</b> barrier that separates the circulating blood from the brain and extracellular fluid in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). The blood–brain barrier is formed by brain endothelial cells and it allows the passage of water, some gases, and lipid-soluble molecules by passive diffusion, as well as the selective transport of molecules such as glucose and amino acids that are crucial to neural function. Furthermore, it prevents the entry of lipophilic potential neurotoxins by way of an active transport mechanism mediated by P-glycoprotein. Astrocytes have been claimed to be necessary to create the blood–brain barrier. A few regions in the brain, including the circumventricular organs, do not have a blood–brain barrier.|$|E

30|$|There are {{two main}} {{approaches}} to prevent oxidation of interfering substances on the electrode surface—a decrease of working potential by introduction of additional substances into the bioselective membrane or deposition of additional <b>semipermeable</b> <b>membranes,</b> which allows selective access of the target substance to the electrode surface [4].

40|$|Ultrafiltration is a {{standard}} method for separating free T 3 and free T 4 from serum proteins and protein-bound hormone (1, 2). It is expected that free T 3 and free T 4 in aqueous solutions will accompany water as water moves across <b>semipermeable</b> <b>membranes,</b> a process that results in equal concentrations of free T 3 and free T 4 in the aqueous solutions {{on opposite sides of}} <b>semipermeable</b> <b>membranes</b> after ultrafiltration.

25|$|The {{idea of a}} <b>semi{{permeable}}</b> <b>membrane,</b> {{a barrier}} that is permeable to solvent but impermeable to solute molecules was developed {{at about the same}} time. The term osmosis originated in 1827 and its importance to physiological phenomena realized, {{but it was not until}} 1877 when the botanist Pfeffer proposed the membrane theory of cell physiology. In this view, the cell was seen to be enclosed by a thin surface, the plasma membrane, and cell water and solutes such as a potassium ion existed in a physical state like that of a dilute solution. In 1889, Hamburger used hemolysis of erythrocytes to determine the permeability of various solutes. By measuring the time required for the cells to swell past their elastic limit, the rate at which solutes entered the cells could be estimated by the accompanying change in cell volume. He also found that there was an apparent nonsolvent volume of about 50% in red blood cells and later showed that this includes water of hydration in addition to the protein and other nonsolvent components of the cells.|$|E
25|$|The lipid {{nature of}} the cell {{membrane}} was first correctly intuited by Quincke, who noted that a cell generally forms a spherical shape in water and, when broken in half, forms two smaller spheres. The only other known material to exhibit this behavior was oil. He also noted that a thin film of oil behaves as a <b>semipermeable</b> <b>membrane,</b> precisely as predicted. Based on these observations, Quincke asserted that the cell membrane comprised a fluid layer of fat less than 100nm thick. This theory was further extended by evidence {{from the study of}} anesthetics. Hans Meyer and Ernest Overton independently noticed that the chemicals which act as general anesthetics are also those soluble in both water and oil. They interpreted this as meaning that to pass the cell membrane a molecule must be at least sparingly soluble in oil, their “lipoid theory of narcosis.” Based on this evidence and further experiments, they concluded that the cell membrane might be made of lecithin (phosphatidylcholine) and cholesterol. Interestingly, one of the early criticisms of this theory was that it included no mechanism for energy-dependent selective transport. This “flaw” would remain unanswered for nearly half a century until the discovery that specialized molecules called integral membrane proteins can act as ion transportation pumps.|$|E
5000|$|Note that a <b>semipermeable</b> <b>membrane</b> is not {{the same}} as a {{selectively}} permeable membrane. <b>Semipermeable</b> <b>membrane</b> describes a membrane that allows some particles to pass through (by size), whereas the selectively permeable membrane [...] "chooses" [...] what passes through (size is not a factor).|$|E

40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that the {{application}} of <b>semipermeable</b> <b>membranes</b> to the skin of premature newborns (NBs) can aid in protecting the skin, reduce disturbances in fluid and electrolyte levels, and decrease neonatal mortality. The aim {{of this study was to}} verify the effect of using <b>semipermeable</b> <b>membranes</b> in low-birth-weight preterm newborns (PTNBs). A randomized con-trolled trial was carried out in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) with 42 NBs split evenly into an intervention group (IG), in which <b>semipermeable</b> <b>membranes</b> were used to cover large areas of the skin for the first 7 days of life, and a control group (CG), which received normal care. The variables investigated for the study were weight, hydration status, urinary density, glycemic control, sodium concentration, and daily hydration quota. The following variables displayed significant daily variation: weight, hydration quota, and sodium concentration. Statistically significant individual effects by day and by group were found only for sodium concentration. In the overall analysis of the intersubject effects, sodium concentration, alone, proved to be significant (p. 055). Significant effects by group in relation to the sodium concentration were found, with the IG showing a lower average sodium concentration than the CG. Thus, the use of <b>semipermeable</b> <b>membranes</b> reduced fluid loss in premature NBs in the cur-rent study, confirming the findings of previous studies.

40|$|A new {{membrane}} fractionation process {{based on}} the combination of hybrid membrane cells and differential diffusion of two solutes was studied by numerical methods. The hybrid <b>membrane</b> cell comprises <b>semipermeable</b> and fully-permeable <b>membrane</b> sub-sections. While the semi-permeable membranes are permeable to the solvent and impermeable to both solutes, the fully-permeable membranes are permeable to all components of the solution, including the solvent. This cell is used to separate the solute with the lower diffusivity from the solute with the higher diffusivity since the former preferentially accumulates {{over the surface of}} the <b>semipermeable</b> <b>membranes</b> and it is preferentially removed in the fully-permeable sub-sections. The separation is demonstrated by numerical results.
