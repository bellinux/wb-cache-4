25|$|On August 1, Greenlee asks David {{for help}} about her leg numbness. She tells David {{that she saw}} someone else besides herself, him and Gale, in the {{hospital}} room. He admits that there is someone {{in the room and}} that he will help her. However, she has to go with him to a clinic that is in Brazil. On August 2, Ryan tells Greenlee that he wants her to go to Brazil. On August 4, it was revealed that Greenlee lied about her leg numbness. The only reason she went with David was so that she could see Leo. David injects her with <b>something</b> <b>before</b> leaving. When Greenlee wakes up, she sees Leo, laying on the hospital bed. On August 5, when Greenlee and Leo share a kiss, it turns out that Greenlee was dreaming; it is revealed that the person who was next to her was Zach. She is soon brought back from The Orpheus Project that David created.|$|E
25|$|On {{the first}} night of the quest, the entire company is {{captured}} by three trolls, who plan to eat them. However, Gandalf arrives, imitating the trolls' voices and causing them to fight amongst themselves until the sun rises, which turns them to stone. As Bilbo searches for supplies in their cave, he meets an injured elf, Lianna (Jennifer Hale), who he assists by finding her healing potion. He also finds a dagger, which he calls Sting. The party then move on to the Elven city of Rivendell, where Elrond tells them of a secret entrance into the Lonely Mountain. They then head to the Misty Mountains. During the night, they are attacked by goblins, and Bilbo is knocked unconscious. He awakens alone and lost. As he wanders through the underground passages, he finds a ring, and encounters a creature named Gollum (Daran Norris). Gollum makes a deal with Bilbo; they will play a game of riddles. If Gollum wins, he will eat Bilbo, but if Bilbo wins, Gollum will show him the way out. Bilbo wins the game, and Gollum says he must get <b>something</b> <b>before</b> he can lead Bilbo out. He then realizes his ring is gone. Bilbo puts the ring on and discovers it makes its wearer invisible. An infuriated Gollum runs to the exit to try to stop Bilbo leaving, unwittingly leading the invisible Bilbo out. He reunites with the dwarves and Gandalf, but the party are then attacked by a groups of goblins and wargs. They climb to the tops of the trees, and are rescued by a band of eagles, who drop them off near Mirkwood Forest.|$|E

500|$|Before Outliers, Gladwell, who {{typically}} writes from a contrarian viewpoint, wrote two best-selling books: The Tipping Point (2000) and Blink (2005). Both {{books have been}} described as [...] "pop economics". The Tipping Point focuses on how ideas and behaviors reach critical mass, such as how Hush Puppies rapidly grew popular in the 1990s. Blink explains [...] "what happens during the first two seconds we encounter <b>something,</b> <b>before</b> we actually start to think". All Gladwell's books focus on singularities: singular events in The Tipping Point, singular moments in Blink, and singular people in Outliers. Gladwell was drawn to writing about singular things after he discovered that [...] "they always made the best stories". Convinced that the most unusual stories had the best chance of reaching the front page of a newspaper, he was [...] "quickly weaned off the notion that [...] should be interested in the mundane".|$|E
500|$|In {{the weeks}} before the release of their third album, Say Anything {{released}} several songs from the album on MySpace.

In Defense of the Genre was released on October 23, 2007. It was released in a dual-disc format complete with 27 songs and contained many guest vocals. When asked about {{the name of the}} record, Bemis said, [...] "Whatever 'genre' (or music) one loves needs a defense, because half the world is too ignorant to really understand <b>something</b> <b>before</b> they dismiss it." [...] Before recording the record, Bemis stated, [...] "I hope that [...] will be more inspiring and uplifting. I want [...] to be The Joshua Tree with balls on laughing gas." ...|$|E

After the awards show, West stated {{in an interview that he}} was not joking and that [...] "Beck needs to respect artistry, he should have given his award to Beyoncé". On February 26, 2015, he publicly apologized to Beck on Twitter. On August 30, 2015, West was presented with the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the MTV Video Music Awards. In his acceptance speech, he stated, [...] "Y'all might be thinking right now, 'I wonder did he smoke <b>something</b> <b>before</b> he came out here?' And the answer is: 'Yes, I rolled up a little something. I knocked the edge off.'" [...] At the end of his speech, he announced, [...] "I have decided in 2020 to run for president." [...] At the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards West was given four minutes to do [...] "whatever he wanted". He chose to debut his new music video for Fade, but first, delivered a speech in which he discussed recent shootings in Chicago, why he included Ray J and Donald Trump in his Famous video, the Taylor Swift situation, his love of Beyoncé and Steve Jobs amongst others.|$|E

2500|$|By {{at least}} 1975 Genie clearly {{understood}} and incorporated {{the concept of}} temporality into her speech, and unusually for people acquiring a first language she understood the words before and after before learning past or future tense markers. She could also use sentences to indicate causation, albeit without saying the words if and then. Despite this, by 1975 Genie remained largely unable to respond to sentences where the nouns {{were not in the}} same sequence as the events, such as [...] "Touch your ear after you touch your nose", although she improved more with sentences asking her to do something after instead of doing <b>something</b> <b>before.</b> In a 1981 paper Curtiss interpreted Genie's temporal utterances as an expansion of Genie's vocabulary, but an outside analysis of Curtiss' writings concluded that Genie had to have acquired some degree of grammar to have formed these sentences.|$|E
