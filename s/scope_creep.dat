50|$|Another very {{important}} concept within {{this method is}} scope management. The scope needs to be managed throughout the project to prevent <b>scope</b> <b>creeping</b> which results in delays. The scope will be determined early and changes to the scope (like adding additional features which were at first considered {{beyond the scope of}} the project) will be evaluated and either accepted or rejected. Changes in the scope can be made but this will always be affected by trade offs between features, resources and time.|$|R

40|$|Every year {{software}} {{project failure}} costs huge sums of money, {{primarily due to}} the lack of appropriate project scope management (PSM). One of the major failure factors is the result of uncertain expansion or change in project scope, also known as <b>scope</b> <b>creeping</b> (SC). Furthermore, SC directly affects the project s budget, schedule, and finally the project quality. Studies have shown that the main causes of SC are ambiguous project scope, vague and incomplete requirements, and a lack of change control management. In addition to these, there are several other causes resulting in SC. As the causes change and emerge differently in different projects, not all of these could be determined in a single project. The main objectives of this thesis is to make an in-depth study on existing causes; explore several academic projects for any new causes; and establish the degree of impact by these causes in development process. Furthermore, it suggests software measurement metrics that support to minimize SC. To fulfill the aim of this thesis, a quantitative research methodology was chosen. A group of students who worked as project managers in various student projects, in a course conducted by the University of Tampere were, requested to fill in a set questionnaire. The collected data from this case study were then coherently analyzed and statistically compared with the data from past research to determine additional causes of SC. This thesis work identified additional causes such as insufficient resource allocation, lack of end-user involvement, ineffective communication, a change in customer needs, platform changes, and the addition of extra features as the major causes of SC. On the other hand, it suggested three metrics: balanced scorecard (BS), earned value management (EVM) and requirement metrics that support the minimization of SC. These metrics can minimize SC by improving the resources allocation, user involvement, and communication. These metrics can also handle the requirements and platform change request from the stakeholders...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{research}} {{study investigated the}} impact of the Project Implementation Profile (PIP) tool on Interface Management (IM) in Public sector facilities projects focusing on KZN Department of Health as a case study. The study identified the interface management challenges encountered by the department and also the advantages that can be realised in using the PIP tool. Lastly the study outlined the impact the PIP tool can bring in improving interface management between stakeholders. Design and Findings: From the existing literature the interface challenges were categorized as financial, contract and specification, environmental and lastly other common problems. The research determined their relevance through a survey. Respondents listed additional challenges and highlighted the advantages and impact of the PIP tool in mitigating interface challenges during project implementation. Practical Implications: The findings outlined the interface management challenges, the advantages of using the PIP tool to mitigate the challenges and the impact the tool has in improving project success rate. However constraints were encountered as some stakeholders were skeptical in answering all the questions. Subjectivity of the information couldn't be avoided as respondents were giving their opinions. It is suggested that this research be expanded in scope to verify that the findings can be generalized. Background: KwaZulu Natal Department of Health (KZNDOH) experience Interface Management challenges in implementation of its infrastructure projects. This has lead <b>scope</b> <b>creeps,</b> time and cost overruns thereby reducing the project success rate. The PIP tool could be the answer in resolving challenges faced. Aim: The research intention is to establish {{the impact of the}} PIP tool when applied to the IM with the purpose of improving the probability of project success in KZNDOH. Methods: A Likert Scale questionnaire was used to establish the current IM challenges. This was coupled with an Action Research method establish additional challenges, the impact of the PIP tool and its advantages. Results: The research delineated IM challenges which reduce the project success rate. It also outlined the impact of the PIP tool which includes improved planning, monitoring and execution of projects. Conclusions: The PIP has a positive impact to the IM challenges as established by the research. Risks are mitigated early during planning, teamwork, efficiency is improved and scope is managed. There is reduction in time and cost overruns resulting in improved project success rate...|$|R
40|$|Where {{construction}} {{research and}} practice are ripe with examples of cost overrun, it rests predominantly with practical accounts {{when it comes to}} systematic reductions in functionality and other aspects of building design to avoid <b>scope</b> and cost <b>creep.</b> Research on such systematic reductions are rare. An emerging research literature on reverse innovation propose ways to understand such efforts. The rise of developing countries as emerging markets triggered a geographically oriented notion of reverse innovation denoting a product or service with limited functionality and a low price developed in a developing country, and later introduced in an advanced country. However, second generation conceptualizations include reverse innovation reducing cost and pricing, but also adding new values of the product or service addressing potential clients in a new way. As most reverse innovation examples communicated are simple consumer products, there is a potential in addressing more complex built products to commence conceptualizing processes and practices of reverse innovation in building, promising access to markets where high end complex build products otherwise cannot enter. The aim is to explore a possible conceptualization of reverse innovation of complex built products and gather insights of reverse innovation processes from praxis cases. The cases of reverse innovation exhibit different features and processes, Where the precedent reverse innovation literature tend to dismiss reduction strategies with departure at a high end product, this practice appear to be recurrent in construction. Once faced with a potential, estimated cost overrun some building designers would follow an ad hoc strategy of reduction in functionality until the cost target is reached. This can lead to a “cut evenly across functional areas – cut one functional area out” dilemma. But also to more proactive strategies, such as offshoring of design work, shift of suppliers, global sourcing, and international expansion. Implications for the building sector are presented...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Scope</b> <b>creep</b> (also called {{requirement}} creep, function creep, or {{kitchen sink}} syndrome) in project management refers to changes, continuous or uncontrolled growth in a project’s scope, {{at any point}} after the project begins.

50|$|The {{deliverable}} {{from the}} Investigation stage is a requirements document {{that has been}} approved by {{all members of the}} team. Later, in the thick of development, this document will be critical in preventing <b>scope</b> <b>creep</b> or unnecessary changes. As the system develops, each new feature opens a world of new possibilities, so the requirements specification anchors the team to the original vision and permits a controlled discussion of scope change.|$|E
50|$|<b>Scope</b> <b>creep</b> {{may occur}} from {{requirements}} moving over time. In Requirements management the alteration of requirements is allowed {{but if not}} adequately tracked or preceding steps (business goals then user requirements) are not throttled by additional oversight or handled as a cost and potential program failure, then requirements changes are easy and likely to happen. It is easy for requirement changes to occur faster than developers are able to produce work, and the effort to go backwards as a result.|$|E
