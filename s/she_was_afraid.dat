5|$|Mary {{wished to}} retire to Castile {{and live with}} her {{recently}} widowed sister Eleanor, near Charles, who had retired. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> of moving to Castile because, although her mentally unstable mother Joanna (who died aged 77 in April 1555) had been sovereign there, Mary had never lived in Castile. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> that Eleanor's death would leave her alone in a country whose customs she did not know. In the end, she {{decided to move to}} Castile, while retaining the possibility of moving back to the Netherlands in case she could not adjust to the Castilian customs. Charles, Eleanor, and Mary sailed from Ghent on 15 September 1556.|$|E

After delivering the manuscript to Bloomsbury on schedule, she took it back for six weeks of revision.|$|E

5|$|Opening {{arguments}} by both {{prosecution and}} defense set up cases based on purported times of death. Basing their assertion on pathologist-given testimony that Jones had died {{about six hours}} after she ate lunch on May 26, the prosecution claimed that Jones had died more than 24 hours before Kinne and Boldizs found her body; defense attorneys argued that death had more likely occurred six to eight hours prior. Prosecutor J. Arnott Hill cited testimony by Chief of Detectives Lieutenant Harry Nesbitt and by Patricia Jones's husband, Walter, as evidence of Kinne's motive for the crime: the detective recalled statements by Kinne that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> Jones was drifting away from her despite the financial support she offered him, and Jones testified that Kinne had {{told him she was}} pregnant by him and he had thereafter attempted to end the relationship.|$|E
5|$|Van Dijk was {{selected}} to represent her country at the Olympic Games in London, and she competed in the road race and the individual time trial {{on the road and}} in the team pursuit on the track. In the road race, Van Dijk was a domestique for Marianne Vos, who won the gold medal. Van Dijk attacked five times but finished outside the time limit. Because the victory of Marianne Vos was seen as a team performance, Van Dijk, Loes Gunnewijk and Annemiek van Vleuten were all subsequently honoured in both the Holland Heineken House and the Ridderzaal. In the time trial, Van Dijk finished eighth. She said afterwards that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> to start too fast and subsequently lost {{a lot of time in}} the first part of the race. In the team pursuit, Van Dijk finished sixth together with Kirsten Wild, Amy Pieters and Vera Koedooder. In the qualification heats, the team had held the Olympic record for a short period and they rode a new Dutch national record in round one. According to Van Dijk, sixth place was the highest attainable place the team could have hoped to achieve.|$|E
25|$|A women's shelter, Sojourn, {{received}} a call from Brown four days prior to the murders; she said that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> of her ex-husband, whom she believed was stalking her. The prosecution did not present this information in court because they thought that Judge Ito would rule the evidence to be hearsay. In addition, friends and family indicated that Brown had consistently said that Simpson had been stalking her. She claimed that everywhere she went, she noticed Simpson would be there, watching her. Her friends Faye Resnick and Cynthia Shahian said <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> because Simpson had told her he would kill her if he ever found her with another man.|$|E

In the hotel room, Lynch raped and beat Piper, threatened to cut her with a razor and hang her, and stabbed her {{several times in the}} arms. After eight hours at the hotel, they drove back to Piper's Golders Green flat. Piper was treated for her wounds at Royal Free Hospital, but withheld the nature of the incident from the doctors and police, because <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> of Lynch.|$|E

They had no children of their own. She corroborated some of Terence's testimony about her husband's treatment of Dennis, and said <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> of her husband and that she believed that had she originally told the truth to the police she would also be dead. Her husband had told her that Dennis was dead and instructed her to lie to the doctor.|$|E
500|$|Giffords and {{her husband}} had spoken dozens of times about how risky her job was. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> that someone would come up to her at a public event with a gun.

Gabrielle Giffords is too tough to let this beat her." ...|$|E
500|$|Katherine Murray Millett {{was born}} on September 14, 1934 to James Albert and Helen Feely Millett in Saint Paul, Minnesota. According to Millett, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> of her father, an engineer, who beat her. He was an {{alcoholic}} who abandoned the family when she was 14, [...] "consigning them {{to a life of}} [...] poverty". Her mother was a teacher and insurance saleswoman.

500|$|A 16-minute tape {{recording}} of Lesley Anne Downey, {{on which the}} voices of Brady and Hindley were audible, was played in open court. Hindley admitted that her attitude towards the child was [...] "brusque and cruel", but claimed that was only because <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> that someone might hear Downey screaming. Hindley claimed that when Downey was being undressed she herself was [...] "downstairs"; when the pornographic photographs were taken she was [...] "looking out the window"; and that when the child was being strangled she [...] "was running a bath".|$|E
500|$|In {{the third}} and final act, in 1994, Kathy is still working as a carer, and has watched many clones {{gradually}} die as their organs are harvested. Kathy, who has not seen Ruth or Tommy since the farm, discovers Ruth, frail after two donations. They find Tommy, who is also weakened by his donations, and drive to the sea. There, Ruth admits that she did not love Tommy, and only seduced him because <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> to be alone. She is consumed with guilt and has been searching for a way to help Tommy and Kathy. She believes that the rumours of [...] "deferral" [...] are true, and has found the address of the gallery owner, Madame, who she thinks may grant deferrals to couples in love. Ruth dies on the operating table shortly afterward.|$|E
500|$|Hoshino {{has named}} Takeshi Obata and Osamu Akimoto as inspiring her work. Her most notable work D.Gray-man is greatly {{influenced}} by her previous titles. Characters are often carried over from unpublished manga Hoshino worked on early in her career. D.Gray-man and its predecessor Zone share many major concepts, such as the creation of demons known as akuma, the Exorcists' role to eliminate these demons, and the overall plot of both works. The main antagonist of Zone, known simply as the Millennium Earl, retains his appearance and name in D.Gray-man while {{the features of the}} female protagonist were changed to create the more masculine appearance of D.Gray-mans male protagonist Allen Walker. The characters Lavi and Yu Kanda were carried over from two unpublished titles. In making the demons known as [...] "Akuma" [...] from D.Gray-man, Hoshino was inspired by the 1973 film, The Exorcist, even though <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> of the movie.|$|E

500|$|Although Caged Bird was {{refreshing}} in its honesty, something {{its readers}} and reviewers value, Angelou's honesty in Gather Together had become, as reviewer John McWhorter perceives it, [...] "more and more formulaic". McWhorter {{asserts that the}} events that Angelou describes in Gather Together and in her subsequent autobiographies require more explanation, which she does not provide, although she expects her readers to accept them on face value. In Gather Together, for example, Angelou insists {{that she is not}} religious, but she refuses welfare, and even though <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> of becoming a lesbian in Caged Bird and presents herself as shy, awkward, and bookish, she pimps for a lesbian couple and becomes a prostitute herself. McWhorter criticizes Angelou for her decisions in Gather Together, and for not explaining them fully, and states, [...] "The people in these flamboyant tales—the narrator included—have a pulp-novel incoherence".|$|E
500|$|Parsons {{agreed to}} move his {{daughter}} to Aldrich's house for further testing on 22January, but when that morning Penn and a man of [...] "veracity and fortune" [...] called on Parsons and asked for Elizabeth, the clerk told them she was not there and refused to reveal her whereabouts. [...] Parsons had spoken with friends and was apparently worried that Kent had been busy with his own investigations. [...] Instead, he allowed Elizabeth to be moved that night to St Bartholomew's Hospital, where another séance was held. [...] Nothing was reported until about 6am, when three scratches were heard, apparently while the girl was asleep. [...] The approximately 20-strong audience complained that the affair was a deception. [...] Once Elizabeth woke she began to cry, and once reassured that she was safe admitted that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> for her father, [...] "who must needs be ruined and undone, if their matter should be {{supposed to be an}} imposture." [...] She also admitted that although she had appeared to be asleep, she was in fact fully aware of the conversation going on around her.|$|E
500|$|Aiello {{was also}} {{believed}} to have masterminded the murder of Pasqualino [...] "Patsy" [...] Lolordo, Lombardo's successor {{as head of the}} Unione, who was killed in his home on January 8, 1929. Police alleged that Aiello suggested a truce with Lolordo, and when Lolordo invited Aiello into his home for a toast of friendship, Aiello and two others shot him to death. When police later questioned Lolordo's widow, she screamed when she was shown a photo of Aiello, but refused to explain why <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> and would not answer questions about him. Capone focused his retaliation against Moran by organizing the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, a hit that wiped out the Gusenberg brothers, decimated Moran's forces and resulted in the loss of a significant amount of Aiello's support. Shortly afterward Aiello persuaded Capone killers Albert Anselmi and John Scalise to betray their employer and convinced Joseph [...] "Hop Toad" [...] Giunta, the new head of the Unione Siciliana, to support Aiello in eliminating Capone and taking control of the North Side of Chicago following the departure of Bugs Moran. However, Capone learned of Aiello's plot in April 1929 and killed all three men.|$|E
