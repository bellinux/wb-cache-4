It analyzes sites, {{examining the}} website's URL, title, form, page layout, visible text and links, {{and uses a}} blacklist to detect phishing sites. Users are blocked access from suspected phishing sites, however are presented an option to continue. In PC Magazine testing, the feature blocked 22 of 24 phishing sites, while Internet Explorer 7 recognized 17 of the 24 sites. In PC Pro testing, the feature successfully blocked access to every phishing site it was tested against. Spam filtering no longer includes a language feature, Symantec claims it is less useful with current spam and created false positives. Tested against 1,500 messages by PC Magazine, Norton let {{over half of the}} <b>spam</b> <b>to</b> the inbox. Five percent of valid mail were marked as spam. This version utilizes Symantec's Veritas VxMS technology to better identify rootkits. VxMS allows Norton to find inconsistencies among files within directories and files at the volume level. A startup application manager allows users to prevent applications from launching at login.

5000|$|There is {{frequent}} confusion {{between the}} terms [...] "splog" [...] and [...] "spam in blogs". Splogs are blogs where the articles are fake, and are only created for search engine <b>spamming.</b> <b>To</b> <b>spam</b> in blogs, conversely, is to include random {{comments on the}} blogs of innocent bystanders, in which spammers {{take advantage of a}} site's ability to allow visitors to post comments that may include links. In fact, one of the earliest uses of the term [...] "splog" [...] referred to the latter.|$|R

25|$|In the infancy of {{affiliate}} marketing, many Internet users held negative opinions due to {{the tendency}} of affiliates to use <b>spam</b> <b>to</b> promote the programs {{in which they were}} enrolled. As affiliate marketing matured, many affiliate merchants have refined their terms and conditions to prohibit affiliates from spamming.|$|E
25|$|E-mail {{and other}} forms of {{spamming}} have been used for purposes other than advertisements. Many early Usenet spams were religious or political. Serdar Argic, for instance, spammed Usenet with historical revisionist screeds. A number of evangelists have spammed Usenet and e-mail media with preaching messages. A growing number of criminals are also using <b>spam</b> <b>to</b> perpetrate various sorts of fraud.|$|E
25|$|As {{search engines}} {{have become more}} prominent, some {{affiliate}} marketers have shifted from sending e-mail <b>spam</b> <b>to</b> creating automatically generated webpages that often contain product data feeds provided by merchants. The goal of such webpages is to manipulate the relevancy or prominence of resources indexed by a search engine, also known as spamdexing. Each page can be targeted to a different niche market {{through the use of}} specific keywords, with the result being a skewed form of search engine optimization.|$|E

After receiving widespread backlash from digital media companies and executives including the likes of Mashable CEO Pete Cashmore, in December 2015 Facebook lifted the prohibition.|$|R
50|$|This is {{typically}} used to add words <b>to</b> <b>spam</b> e-mails, <b>to</b> bypass hash filters. As the e-mail's hash sum {{is different from}} the sum of e-mails previously defined as spam, the e-mail is not considered spam and therefore delivered {{as if it were a}} normal message.|$|R
25|$|In the Philippines, Spam is {{a popular}} food item and seen as a {{cultural}} symbol. It is prepared and used {{in a variety of}} ways, including being fried, served alongside condiments, or used in sandwiches. The canned meat's popularity transcends economic class, and Spam gift sets are even used as homecoming gifts. There are more than 9 different varieties of Spam currently available in the country and an estimated 1.25million kilos of the meat is sold every year in the Philippines. During the rescue efforts after Typhoon Ondoy (Ketsana) in 2009, Hormel Foods donated over 30,000pounds of <b>Spam</b> <b>to</b> the Philippine National Red Cross.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Marvin Johnson, a {{legislative}} {{counsel for the}} ACLU, stated that proposed anti-spam legislation infringed on free speech by denying anonymity and by forcing <b>spam</b> <b>to</b> be labeled as such, [...] "Standardized labeling is compelled speech." [...] He also stated, [...] "It's relatively simple to click and delete." [...] The debate found the ACLU joining with the Direct Marketing Association and the Center for Democracy and Technology in 2000 in criticizing a bipartisan bill in the House of Representatives. As early as 1997, the ACLU had taken a strong position that nearly all spam legislation was improper, although it has supported [...] "opt-out" [...] requirements in some cases. The ACLU opposed the 2003 CAN-SPAM act suggesting {{that it could have}} a chilling effect on speech in cyberspace. It has been criticized for this position.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the album's release, Idol {{was asked}} if he feared his new {{interest}} in technology would be seen as an attempt to co-opt cyberculture. Idol denied this, stating that his belief in the relevancy of cyberpunk culture was genuine, and that he didn't care what others thought of him. However, the reaction by the majority of the online community was openly hostile and suspicious of Idol's motives. It was reported that his e-mail account on the WELL received mail from angry computer users, and was occasionally flooded with e-mail <b>spam</b> <b>to</b> antagonise him. Idol was also cast by many as a naive, tech-illiterate poseur. The charge of illiteracy was not entirely false, as {{at the time of the}} album's release, Idol was still typing using the [...] "hunt and peck" [...] system, and needed notes to log onto the internet.|$|E

50|$|With the internationalism of the Internet, {{jurisdiction}} is a {{much more}} tricky area than before, and courts in different countries have taken various views on whether they have jurisdiction over items published on the Internet, or business agreements entered into over the Internet.

50|$|Because of {{the large}} amount of <b>spam</b> posted <b>to</b> user-editable webpages, Google {{proposed}} a nofollow tag that could be embedded with links. A link-based search engine, such as Google's PageRank system, will not use the link to increase the score of the linked website if the link carries a nofollow tag. This ensures that <b>spamming</b> links <b>to</b> user-editable websites will not raise the sites ranking with search engines. Nofollow is used by several major websites, including Wordpress, Blogger and Wikipedia.|$|R
50|$|The recipient's SMTP server sees {{only the}} {{forwarding}} system's IP address.

Therefore, recipients cannot reliably distinguish <b>spam</b> <b>to</b> the alias address from spam generated on the forwarding system. When a recipient reports a message to his ISP as spam, the ISP credits that <b>spam</b> <b>to</b> the forwarding system.
