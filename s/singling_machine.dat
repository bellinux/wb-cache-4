40|$|The {{majority}} of <b>single</b> <b>machine</b> sequencing research has assumed {{that only one}} objective is to be minimized. The research involving multiple objectives has been limited. Recent studies have shown, however, that production managers often consider multiple objectives when making scheduling decisions. The primary reason {{for the lack of}} literature on multiple objective scheduling is the additional complexity encountered when determining the 'best' solution. Although a host of general multiple objective optimization procedures exists, the vast majority cannot be efficiently applied to the multiple objective <b>single</b> <b>machine</b> sequencing problem. Most procedures assume continuous decision variables, whereas the <b>single</b> <b>machine</b> sequencing problem requires integer variables. While some of these procedures could be altered to directly address integer models, the overall combinatorial nature of most sequencing problems limits the applicability to sequencing. A comprehensive review of the published literature on the multiple objective <b>single</b> <b>machine</b> sequencing problem is presented in this paper.

40|$|With {{the growth}} of data and {{necessity}} for distributed optimization methods, solvers that work well on a <b>single</b> <b>machine</b> must be re-designed to leverage distributed computation. Recent {{work in this area}} has been limited by focusing heavily on developing highly specific methods for the distributed environment.

Further, they are unable to easily integrate improvements that continue to be made to <b>single</b> <b>machine</b> methods. To this end, we present a framework for distributed optimization that both allows the flexibility of arbitrary solvers to be used on each (<b>single)</b> <b>machine</b> locally, and yet maintains competitive performance against other state-of-the-art special-purpose distributed methods.

40|$|Abstract. The {{current state}} of the art {{regarding}} scalable reasoning consists of programs that run on a <b>single</b> <b>machine.</b> When the amount of data is too large, or the logic is too complex, the computational resources of a <b>single</b> <b>machine</b> are not enough.

40|$|This paper {{proposed}} some corollaries {{to obtain}} some performance measures of multipurpose <b>machine</b> from its <b>single</b> <b>machine</b> units. It {{is well known}} that multipurpose scheduling problems are NP-Hard. Similarly, increases in the number of machine in scheduling problem induce additional computational complexity and new problems, thus the larger the number of machines in a scheduling problem, the higher the degree of computational complexity involved. Therefore, any attempt to obtain the performance objectives of multiple machine environment scheduling problems from its <b>single</b> <b>machine</b> component will make the problems more amenable to solution and increase the efficiency of any proposed algorithm. This paper proposed some rules {{that can be used to}} obtain some performance objectives of multipurpose machine environment from its <b>single</b> <b>machine</b> units.

40|$|Abstract. Electromagnetism-like {{algorithm}} (EM) is a population-based meta-heuristic {{which has}} been proposed to solve continuous problems effectively. In this paper, we present a new meta-heuristic that uses the EM methodology to solve the <b>single</b> <b>machine</b> scheduling problem. <b>Single</b> <b>machine</b> scheduling is a combinatorial optimization problem. Schedule representation for our problem is based on random keys. Because there is little research in solving the combinatorial optimization problem (COP) by EM, the paper attempts to employ the random-key concept enabling EM to solve COP in <b>single</b> <b>machine</b> scheduling problem. We present a hybrid algorithm that combines the EM methodology and genetic operators to obtain the best/optimal schedule for this <b>single</b> <b>machine</b> scheduling problem, which attempts to achieve convergence and diversity effect when they iteratively solve the problem. The objective in our problem is minimization of the sum of earliness and tardiness. This hybrid algorithm was tested {{on a set of}} standard test problems available in the literature.
