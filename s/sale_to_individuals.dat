50|$|The {{body of the}} car was {{designed}} and marketed by Pininfarina with styling by Tom Tjaarda, The AS cars had a torque tube transmitting power to the rear wheels; this crack-prone design {{was replaced by a}} trailing arm rear axle with the second series (BS) during 1969.

In July 1970 the 1.6-liter BS1 appeared; this model is recognizable by its twin humps on the bonnet and bumper overriders. The CS series Spider arrived during 1972. Also in 1972, a sports version of the Spider debuted. This was required for a type-approval of its rally version, which earned some remarkable success. The models sold in showrooms were marked as 124 CSA (C-Spider-Abarth). The vehicle has a capacity of 128 hp.

5000|$|The {{reality of}} static trench warfare in World War I created {{a need for}} short, handy close-combat weapons {{that could be used}} in the {{confines}} of a trench. With pistols in short supply, a variety of knives and other stabbing weapons were created or issued to troops serving in the trenches. Originally most of these weapons were fabricated in the field from readily available materials such as metal stakes, but soon factory-made examples of knuckle knives and push daggers appeared at the front, and were used by both sides in the conflict. In Britain the Robbins-Dudley Co. of Dudley, Worcestershire, a metalworking concern, was one of the first commercial producers of specialised wartime knuckle-knives and push daggers for private <b>sale</b> <b>to</b> <b>individual</b> soldiers and officers. [...] The typical Robbins-Dudley push dagger - referred to as a 'punch knife' by its maker - utilised an aluminium 'knuckle'-type handle cast onto a 3.625-in.
