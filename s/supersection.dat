In 1986, mycologist Thom Kuyper placed the species in the <b>supersection</b> Marginatae (subgenus Inocybe), along with species including I.abietis, I.calospora and I.praetervisa. Rolf Singer considers Marginatae a section in subgenus Inocybe, but he placed I.godeyi in the section Geophyllinae (in the subgenus Inocibium) along with species including I.agglutinata and I.pudica. A 2002 phylogenetic study found that Singer's Geophyllinae is probably monophyletic (that is, the taxa all come from a common, recent ancestor) and suggested that I.godeyi forms a clade with species including I.abietis, I.corydalina, I.agglutinata and I.pudica.

40|$|Passiflora {{subgenus}} Decaloba <b>supersection</b> Cieca is a monophyletic {{group of}} herbaceous to woody climbers found in subtropical and tropical {{regions of the}} world. The 19 species recognized here are primarily distributed in the southern United States, Mexico, Central America, South America, and the Caribbean. Two species, P. suberosa and P. pallida, are also naturalized in various regions of the Old World. The species of the <b>supersection</b> are recognized by their small, apetalous, usually greenish flowers with the filaments of the corona mostly in two series. The plants commonly lack c-glycosylflavones but possess flavonol 3 -O-glycosides. The <b>supersection</b> contains two problematic species complexes, P. suberosa and P. coriacea. Phylogenetic relationships within <b>supersection</b> Cieca are investigated by means of phenetic and cladistic analyses of morphological and molecular (ITS 1 & 2) characters. The morphological and molecular data sets were analyzed separately because of incongruity due to taxon sampling and the complicated evolutionary history of entities within the P. suberosa complex. All analyses confirm the monophyly of the <b>supersection.</b> They also show that the P. suberosa complex is a non-monophyletic group of cryptic species, and inter-taxic hybridization and polyploidy {{have contributed to the}} confusing and complex pattern of variation evident within the group. Four taxa that were formerly included in this complex are recognized: P. pallida, P. suberosa subsp. suberosa, P. suberosa subsp. litoralis, and P. tridactylites. On the basis of molecular and morphological data, three species from the P. coriacea complex are recognized: P. coriacea, P. sexocellata, and P. megacoriacea. A key, detailed descriptions, distribution maps, and illustrations are included in the revision. Pollination, dispersal, and herbivory of the group are reviewed. The distribution and ecology of the species within the <b>supersection</b> are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Morphological {{variation}} was {{studied in}} 124 accessions from 61 Passiflora L. species. Twenty-four quantitative descriptors selected for their high variation among subgenera were {{submitted to a}} principal component analysis. The first principal component (32 % of total variance) was associated with flower length and secondarily with floral cup constriction, the second (27 %) with flower width and bract shape, and the third (14 %) with peduncle branching, stem width, and leaf length, which relates it to the differentiation of subgenera Astrophea and Deidamioides. The projection of accessions in the resulting tridimensional space consistently separates the four subgenera, as well as <b>supersection</b> Tacsonia of subgenus Passiflora. A neighbor joining analysis, on a selection of 32 qualitative traits and four categorized quantitative variables, clustered species according to their chromosome number and, within subgenus Passiflora, separated supersections Tacsonia (pollinated by the sword-billed hummingbird) and Distephana (pollinated by shorter-billed hummingbirds) from all other, bee-pollinated, species. Thus, the morphological study allows separating the effects of genome evolution from those of more recent and independent coevolutions concerning the pollination syndromes of supersections Tacsonia and Distephana. Within subgenus Decaloba, diverging subclusters are consistent with supersections and particular sections, with the partial exception of <b>supersection</b> Decaloba. Within <b>supersection</b> Tacsonia, subclusters correspond {{to one or two}} sections, pointing to overclassification in the current taxonomy. Among the bee-pollinated species of subgenus Passiflora, only <b>supersection</b> Laurifolia is clearly validated. Most of these results are consistent with molecular phylogenetic studies, except for interspecific relations among bee-pollinated species of subgenus Passiflora, which appear particularly difficult to classify.

40|$|Poa L., {{is known}} as a highly diverse {{cosmopolitan}} genus with taxonomic difficulties that includes unknown species and species with uncertain affinities mainly in West Asia and North Africa. Poa also exhibits a close relationship with two West Asian genera, Eremopoa Roshev. and Oreopoa H. Scholz & Parolly. This study was conducted to: 1) fill the gap of information on the affinities between Poa species with an emphasis on West Asian Poa; 2) revise and evaluate the accuracy of traditional infrageneric classification of West Asian Poa; and 3) clarify the relationship between Poa and two allied genera of Poaceae Barnhart, Eremopoa and Oreopoa. DNA molecular evidence from present phylogenetic analyses of West Asian species of Poa, Eremopoa and Oreopoa, resulted in some great findings as follow: I) Poa caucasica Trin., which is currently assigned to subsection Nivicolae of section Poa from subgenus Poa resolved as a unique new distinct lineage within Poa. II), New treatments are suggested for Poa densa Troitsky, Poa masenderana Freyn & Sint., Poa cenisia All., Poa psychrophila Boiss. & Heldr. and Poa lipskyi.
