25|$|The oxide {{forms on}} the surface of the tantalum, but it also grows into the material. For each unit {{thickness}} of oxide growth, one third grows out and two thirds grows in.

25|$|The {{resulting}} acoustic {{structure of}} concrete speech productions {{depends on the}} physical and psychological properties of individual speakers. Men, women, and children generally produce voices having different pitch. Because speakers have vocal tracts of different sizes (due to sex and age especially) the resonant frequencies (formants), which are important for recognition of speech sounds, will vary in their absolute values across individuals (<b>see</b> <b>Figure</b> <b>3</b> for an illustration of this). Research shows that infants {{at the age of}} 7.5 months cannot recognize information presented by speakers of different genders; however by the age of 10.5 months, they can detect the similarities. Dialect and foreign accent can also cause variation, as can the social characteristics of the speaker and listener.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the great}} variety of {{different}} speakers and different conditions, listeners perceive vowels and consonants as constant categories. It has been proposed that this is achieved {{by means of the}} perceptual normalization process in which listeners filter out the noise (i.e. variation) to arrive at the underlying category. Vocal-tract-size differences result in formant-frequency variation across speakers; therefore a listener has to adjust his/her perceptual system to the acoustic characteristics of a particular speaker. This may be accomplished by considering the ratios of formants rather than their absolute values. This process has been called vocal tract normalization (<b>see</b> <b>Figure</b> <b>3</b> for an example). Similarly, listeners are believed to adjust the perception of duration to the current tempo of the speech they are listening to – this has been referred to as speech rate normalization.|$|E

Our signature is an implementation of the multiscale curve representation first introduced in [2].

We also introduce a global descriptor which captures the distributions of these coefficients in order to perform pruning and speed up the whole search process (<b>see</b> <b>Figures</b> <b>3</b> and 12).|$|R
2500|$|Typically, the STM is used {{to develop}} “surface water profiles,” or {{longitudinal}} representations of channel depth, for channels experiencing gradually varied flow. [...] These transitions can be classified based on reach condition (mild or steep), and also the type of transition being made. [...] Mild reaches occur where normal depth is subcritical (yn > yc) while steep reaches occur where normal depth is supercritical (yn). [...] The transitions are classified by zone.

2500|$|The slurry is {{introduced}} {{at the top}} of the downcomer as a jet that draws in air through a second pipe to form a stable two-phase mixture (<b>see</b> <b>Figure</b> <b>3).</b> The plunging slurry jet shears and then entrains the air. The target minerals, with their collector-coated surfaces, attach to the bubbles and this mixture travels down the downcomer, driven by hydrostatic forces, before it is discharged into the tank portion of the Jameson Cell (see Figure 4). The downcomer is designed to provide high-intensity mixing of the air and the slurry to generate a dense foam of fine bubbles and maximise the contact between the target mineral particles and the bubbles. The probability of particle–bubble contact is [...] "virtually 100%" [...] with a slurry residence time in the downcomer of 5–10 seconds.|$|E
2500|$|Cyproterone acetate was {{developed}} to overcome this problem. It is formed by adding an acetate group to cyproterone, <b>see</b> <b>figure</b> <b>3.</b> Cyproterone acetate has a dual mode of action as it competes directly with DHT for binding to AR, but also inhibits gonadotropin secretion. It thereby reduces androgen, estrogen and LH levels. Cyproterone acetate acts both directly as an antiandrogen in prostate cancer cells and also functions to indirectly decrease serum testosterone levels. The latter causes the limitations of cyproterone acetate, which are central effects on androgen secretion, with subsequent loss of libido and sexual potency. Several reports also state that cyproterone acetate causes liver hyperplasia. These side effects gave pharmaceutical companies the incentive to search for alternative, [...] "pure" [...] NSAAs {{that would not have}} these side effects. [...] Pure antiandrogens block the androgen receptor without exerting any agonistic or any other hormonal activity.|$|E

60|$|I will here give {{a sketch}} of the general form and {{structure}} of the many atolls and atoll-formed reefs which occur in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, comparing them with Keeling atoll. The Maldiva atolls and the Great Chagos Bank differ in so many respects, that I shall devote to them, besides occasional references, a third section of this chapter. Keeling atoll may be considered as of moderate dimensions and of regular form. Of the thirty-two islands surveyed by Captain Beechey in the Low Archipelago, the longest was found to be thirty miles, and the shortest less than a mile; but Vliegen atoll, situated {{in another part of the}} same group, appears to be sixty miles long and twenty broad. Most of the atolls in this group are of an elongated form; thus Bow Island is thirty miles in length, and on an average only six in width (See Figure 4, Plate I.), and Clermont Tonnere has nearly the same proportions. In the Marshall Archipelago (the Ralick and Radack group of Kotzebue) several of the atolls are more than thirty miles in length, and Rimsky Korsacoff is fifty-four long, and twenty wide, at the broadest part of its irregular outline. Most of the atolls in the Maldiva Archipelago are of great size, one of them (which, however, bears a double name) measured in a medial and slightly curved line, is no less than eighty-eight geographical miles long, its greatest width being under twenty, and its least only nine and a half miles. Some atolls have spurs projecting from them; and in the Marshall group there are atolls united together by linear reefs, for instance Menchikoff Island (<b>See</b> <b>Figure</b> <b>3,</b> Plate II.), which is sixty miles in length, and consists of three loops tied together. In far the greater number of cases an atoll consists of a simple elongated ring, with its outline moderately regular.|$|E
