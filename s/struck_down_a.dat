5|$|Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association, 564 U.S. 786 (2011), is a {{landmark}} case by the Supreme Court of the United States that <b>struck</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> 2005 California law banning {{the sale of}} certain violent video games to children without parental supervision. In a 7–2 decision, the Court upheld the lower court decisions and nullified the law, ruling that video games were protected speech under the First Amendment as other forms of media.|$|E
5|$|The {{courts have}} rarely treated {{content-based}} regulation of journalism with any sympathy. In Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo (1974), the Court unanimously <b>struck</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> state law requiring newspapers criticizing political candidates to publish their responses. The state {{claimed that the}} law had been passed to ensure journalistic responsibility. The Supreme Court found that freedom, but not responsibility, is mandated by the First Amendment and so it ruled that the government may not force newspapers to publish that which they do not desire to publish.|$|E
5|$|Afroyim v. Rusk, , {{is a major}} United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court ruled that {{citizens}} of the United States may not be deprived of their citizenship involuntarily. The U.S. government had attempted to revoke the citizenship of Beys Afroyim, a man born in Poland, because he had cast a vote in an Israeli election after becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen. The Supreme Court decided that Afroyim's right to retain his citizenship was guaranteed by the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. In so doing, the Court <b>struck</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> federal law mandating loss of U.S. citizenship for voting in a foreign election—thereby overruling one of its own precedents, Perez v. Brownell (1958), in which it had upheld loss of citizenship under similar circumstances less than a decade earlier.|$|E

50|$|As a {{judge of}} the High Court, McTiernan oversaw several of the most {{significant}} cases in Australian legal history, including Bank of New South Wales v Commonwealth, which <b>struck</b> <b>down</b> <b>an</b> attempt to nationalise the banks, Australian Communist Party v The Commonwealth, which <b>struck</b> <b>down</b> <b>an</b> attempt to ban the Communist Party of Australia and R v Kirby; ex parte Boilermakers' Society of Australia, which reinforced the doctrine of the separation of powers. He served under five Chief Justices - Sir Isaac Isaacs, Sir Frank Gavan Duffy, Sir John Latham, Sir Owen Dixon and Sir Garfield Barwick, and was knighted himself in 1951.|$|R
50|$|In 1997 Libman won a {{unanimous}} Supreme Court of Canada judgement in Libman v Quebec (AG). Certain {{sections of the}} Quebec Referendum Law, concerning restrictions on third party spending, were <b>struck</b> <b>down.</b> <b>As</b> {{a result of this}} decision, the charges against federalist groups who participated in the large Pro-Canada Rally during the 1995 referendum campaign were cancelled.|$|R
5|$|In some states, {{there are}} Son of Sam laws prohibiting convicted criminals from {{publishing}} memoirs for profit. These laws were {{a response to}} offers to David Berkowitz to write memoirs about the murders he committed. The Supreme Court <b>struck</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> law of this type in New York {{as a violation of}} the First Amendment in the case Simon & Schuster v. Crime Victims Board (1991). That statute did not prohibit publication of a memoir by a convicted criminal. Instead, it provided that all profits from the book were to be put in escrow for a time. The interest from the escrow account was used to fund the New York State Crime Victims Board – an organization that pays the medical and related bills of victims of crime. Similar laws in other states remain unchallenged.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{accepted}} {{an appointment to}} the circuit court of Bourbon and Clark counties in 1817. It was in this capacity that the most defining event of his career occurred. In 1822, he <b>struck</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> debt relief law {{in the case of}} Williams v. Blair on the basis that it impeded the obligation of contracts. His decision was unpopular with the legislature, who condemned the ruling and summoned Clark to appear before them and defend it. An attempt by the legislature to remove him from office fell short of the needed two-thirds majority. The following year, the Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld Clark's ruling. In retaliation, the legislature attempted to abolish the court and create a new one more sympathetic to their views. This event and its aftermath became known as the Old Court-New Court controversy.|$|E
5|$|Scalia {{maintained}} that every element of {{an offense that}} helps determine the sentence must be either admitted by the defendant or found by a jury under the Sixth Amendment's jury guarantee. In the 2000 case of Apprendi v. New Jersey, Scalia wrote the Court's majority opinion that <b>struck</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> state statute that allowed the trial judge to increase the sentence if the judge found the offense was a hate crime. Scalia found the procedure impermissible because {{whether it was a}} hate crime had not been decided by the jury. In 2004, he wrote for the Court in Blakely v. Washington, striking down Washington state's sentencing guidelines on similar grounds. The dissenters in Blakely foresaw that Scalia would use the case to attack the federal sentencing guidelines (which he had failed to strike down in Mistretta), and they proved correct, as Scalia led a five-member majority in United States v. Booker, which made those guidelines no longer mandatory for federal judges to follow (they remained advisory).|$|E

5|$|The Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Regents of the University of California v. Bakke (1978) {{that affirmative action}} {{in the form of}} racial quotas in public {{university}} admissions was a violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; however, race could be used as one of several factors without violating of the Equal Protection Clause or Title VI. In Gratz v. Bollinger (2003) and Grutter v. Bollinger (2003), the Court considered two race-conscious admissions systems at the University of Michigan. The university claimed that its goal in its admissions systems was to achieve racial diversity. In Gratz, the Court <b>struck</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> points-based undergraduate admissions system that added points for minority status, finding that its rigidity violated the Equal Protection Clause; in Grutter, the Court upheld a race-conscious admissions process for the university's law school that used race as one of many factors to determine admission. In Fisher v. University of Texas (2013), the Court ruled that before race {{can be used in a}} public university's admission policy, there must be no workable race-neutral alternative. In Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action (2014), the Court upheld the constitutionality of a state constitutional prohibition on the state or local use of affirmative action.|$|E
25|$|Royall v. Virginia (1886) <b>struck</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> {{misdemeanor}} {{conviction for}} unauthorized practice under the Contract Clause. Royall's case repeatedly reached the Waite Court through various jurisdictional means, and ultimately Royall was denied relief.|$|E

25|$|The {{protection}} of commercial expression was first established in Ford v. Quebec (1988) where the Court <b>struck</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> Quebec law requiring all signs to be exclusively in French. This was soon followed by Irwin Toy v. Quebec where the Court found that Quebec law prohibiting advertising to children to violate section 2(b) but was saved under section 1.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Equality Mississippi {{submitted}} an amicus brief to the United States Supreme Court in Lawrence v. Texas. In the case, the Court <b>struck</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> Texas {{state law}} banning private consensual sex between adults {{of the same}} sex in a decision gay rights groups hailed as historic. The ruling invalidated anti-sodomy laws in 12 other states, including Mississippi.|$|E
25|$|Although anti-miscegenation {{amendments}} were {{proposed in}} United States Congress in 1871, 1912–1913 and 1928, a nationwide law against racially mixed marriages was never enacted. Prior to the California Supreme Court's ruling in Perez v. Sharp (1948), no {{court in the}} United States had ever <b>struck</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> ban on interracial marriage. In 1967, the United States Supreme Court unanimously ruled in Loving v. Virginia that anti-miscegenation laws are unconstitutional.|$|E

The court's decision in this case continues to provide precedent today in many cases involving judicial impartiality.|$|R
25|$|The High Court of Australia, after {{paving the}} way by {{striking}} down a State statute under the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, overruled Milirrpum in Mabo v Queensland (No 2) (1992). Mabo, rejecting terra nullius, held that native title exists (6–1) and is extinguishable by the sovereign (7–0), without compensation (4–3). In {{the wake of the}} decision, the Australian Parliament passed the Native Title Act 1993 (NTA), codifying the doctrine and establishing the National Native Title Tribunal (NNTT). Western Australia v Commonwealth (1995) upheld the NTA and <b>struck</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> conflicting Western Australia statute.|$|E
25|$|Others {{involved}} the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Strauder v. West Virginia (1880) and Bush v. Kentucky (1883) reversed convictions because of racial exclusion {{in the jury}} system. In Pace v. Alabama (1883), the Court upheld an adultery prohibition that punished inter-racial fornication more than same-race fornication. Pace was overruled by McLaughlin v. Florida (1964). Yick Wo v. Hopkins (1886) <b>struck</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> discretionary laundry permitting system that disadvantaged Asians. Hayes v. Missouri (1887) rejected an equal protection challenge to a statute authorizing the prosecution more peremptory challenges in large cities.|$|E
25|$|In Lawrence v. Texas (2003), the Court <b>struck</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> Texas statute prohibiting {{homosexual}} sodomy on substantive {{due process}} grounds. In Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's opinion concurring in the judgment, however, she argued that by prohibiting only homosexual sodomy, and not heterosexual sodomy as well, Texas's statute {{did not meet}} rational-basis review under the Equal Protection Clause; her opinion prominently cited City of Cleburne, and also relied in part on Romer. Notably, O'Connor's opinion did not claim to apply {{a higher level of}} scrutiny than mere rational basis, and the Court has not extended suspect-class status to sexual orientation.|$|E

25|$|New England is {{the first}} {{region of the country}} where all states within it have granted {{marriage}} rights to same-sex couples. The rapid makeover of its legal landscape made New England a notable standout within the United States. In other parts of the country, while support for same-sex marriage had been gaining steadily, it was still a minority view. Only two states and one district outside the region, Iowa, neighboring New York and the District of Columbia, had allowed same-sex marriage before the 2012 election; voters in California <b>struck</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> law supporting such marriages during the fall of 2008.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{explanations}} {{on the origin}} of the Ljubljana Dragon. According to a Slavic myth, the slaying of a dragon releases the waters and ensures the fertility of the earth, and it is thought that the myth is tied to the Ljubljana Marshes, the expansive marshy area that periodically threatens Ljubljana with flooding. According to the celebrated Greek legend, the Argonauts on their return home after having taken the Golden Fleece found a large lake surrounded by a marsh between the present-day towns of Vrhnika and Ljubljana. It was there that Jason <b>struck</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> monster. This monster has evolved into the dragon that today is present in the city coat of arms and flag.|$|E
25|$|He {{was also}} brave in admitting his {{mistakes}} and displayed fervent determination in his actions. In his earlier years, Ling Tong <b>struck</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> superior officer called Chen Qin, who earlier insulted {{him and his}} late father. The incident caused Chen Qin to die of severe wounds several days later. Ling Tong then fought recklessly {{in the battle against}} the bandits after exclaiming that only through death could he cleanse his deep guilt. Thus, his attack {{turned out to be a}} huge success, yet he bound himself and surrendered to the discipline officer after the victorious battle to await his punishment. However, Sun Quan pardoned him on account of his achievements and promoted him to a higher military rank.|$|E
