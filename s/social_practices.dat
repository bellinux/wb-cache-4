5|$|According to Kuhn, {{science is}} an {{inherently}} communal activity {{which can only}} be done as part of a community. For him, the fundamental difference between science and other disciplines {{is the way in which}} the communities function. Others, especially Feyerabend and some post-modernist thinkers, have argued that there is insufficient difference between <b>social</b> <b>practices</b> in science and other disciplines to maintain this distinction. For them, social factors play an important and direct role in scientific method, but they do not serve to differentiate science from other disciplines. On this account, science is socially constructed, though this does not necessarily imply the more radical notion that reality itself is a social construct.|$|E

As such, Bahá'ís regard the major religions as fundamentally unified in purpose, though varied in <b>social</b> <b>practices</b> and interpretations. There is a similar emphasis on the unity of all people, openly rejecting notions of racism and nationalism.

The research is concerned with grassroots arts-led interventions in the urban realm, participated in by citizens with an aim to improve the urban lived experience and to form and cultivate connections between people, place and community. This {{has come to be}} termed {{in the course of the}} research ‘social <b>practice</b> placemaking’ (<b>social</b> <b>practice</b> placemaking 3), a practice observed in the placemaking sector as an approach that is informed by <b>social</b> <b>practice</b> arts and an attention on these arts as a means of urban revitalization. Operating at the intersection of arts, placemaking and urban theory, and place attachment thinking, the research has used a comparative approach based on participant observation and interviews at three case study sites: Art Tunnel Smithfield, Dublin, an outdoor art gallery and garden space; The Drawing Shed, London, a <b>social</b> arts <b>practice</b> predominantly operating in housing estates in Walthamstow and Wandsworth; and Big Car, Indianapolis, an arts organisation operating across the whole of this Midwest USA city. Findings are along three themes. Firstly, of the art practice and process of <b>social</b> <b>practice</b> placemaking, revealing the collaborative <b>social</b> <b>practice</b> placemaking art experience. Secondly, of urban space and place and <b>social</b> <b>practice</b> placemaking as a means of reinterpreting both spatial and cultural activities of the city. Thirdly, of place attachment and <b>social</b> <b>practice</b> placemaking and its role in and citizenship conscientisation and the politics of <b>social</b> <b>practice</b> placemaking activity in the urban public realm. The research presents an original typology of practice for the placemaking sector and examines the practice, process and role of arts in the placemaking sector and positions <b>social</b> <b>practice</b> placemaking in the <b>social</b> <b>practice</b> arts field. Significantly, the presentation of data includes the voice of the artist and non-artist protagonists. The research has various implications for the sector. Firstly, for creative and urban professionals and communities, by revealing how <b>social</b> <b>practice</b> placemaking can deepen an understanding of the relative agencies of the various modes of arts in place. Secondly, how this practice may advance placemaking practice as a whole by its use to better understand differences and similarities between placemakings within the placemaking sector, and from this, better communicate its practices to constituent stakeholders in the creative, urban design and community sectors. Thirdly, how this practice can inform the understanding of collective progressive citizenship in the urban realm and inform generative planning practices...|$|R

40|$|Examining work as <b>social</b> <b>practice</b> {{offers a}} means of {{understanding}} relations between behaviour and the social world; or the mind in activity. Recent views have proposed that cognition is distributed (Hutchins 1991, Resnick, et al 1997) or stretched (Lave 1991) across the social partners and artefacts that comprise the <b>social</b> <b>practice</b> in which they act. Therefore, more than proposing <b>social</b> <b>practice</b> as a context for cognition, it seems necessary to understand the reciprocal, co-constructive nature of knowledge construction, its application and how judgements about its efficacy might arise. Emanating from these concerns, are important factors associated relations between individuals' thinking, acting and knowing and how they act (Cobb 1998) (or are permitted to act) in <b>social</b> <b>practice</b> such as work (Darrah 1997, Hull 1997). The study of work as <b>social</b> <b>practice</b> may permit these relationships to be understood more clearly. From an investigation of emerging work practice, a basis for understanding work, the requirements for performance and the means for learning these requirements are presented.

Several pieces of research investigate the positive contribution of the arts in children’s literacy development in the early years settings.

To progress incorporating social theory into health, researchers have used Giddens&# 039; and Bourdieu&# 039;s conceptualisations of <b>social</b> <b>practice</b> to understand relationships between agency, structure and health. However, <b>social</b> <b>practice</b> theories have more to offer than has currently been capitalised upon. This article delves into contemporary theories of <b>social</b> <b>practice</b> as used in consumption and sustainability research to provide an alternative, and more contextualised means, of understanding and explaining human action in relation to health and wellbeing. Two key observations are made. Firstly, the latest formulations of <b>social</b> <b>practice</b> theory distinguish moments of practice performance from practices as persistent entities across time and space, allowing empirical application to explain practice histories and future trajectories. Secondly, they emphasise the materiality of everyday life, foregrounding things, technologies and other non-humans that cannot be ignored in a technologically dependent social world. In concluding, I argue the value of using contemporary <b>social</b> <b>practice</b> theories in health research is that they reframe {{the way in which}} health outcomes can be understood and could inform more effective interventions that move beyond attitudes, behaviour and choices...|$|R
