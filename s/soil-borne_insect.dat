40|$|Natural entomopathogenic {{nematodes}} (EPNs) {{are considered}} as potential biological control agents against <b>soil-borne</b> <b>insect</b> pests. This {{study was conducted}} to determine the impact of land use on the distribution, occurrence and diversity of entomopathogenic nematode community. Isolation of EPNs was done using the baiting technique and application of morphological identification methods revealed presence of the genus Steinernema. Land use intensification negatively affected the occurrence and recovery frequency in soils of Embu and Taita districts. The occurrence of EPNs was high in soils from coffee than maize and beans which had more nematodes than planted forest and napier grass followed by natural forest and tea respectively. PCR-RFLP of the internal transcribed spacer region on the ribosomal(r) DNA of the EPN isolates and digestion of the products by Alu I enzyme showed molecular variations among the isolates. The study has demonstrated that the frequency of occurrence and species variation of EPNs is different in various land uses. Peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} three organophosphorus {{insecticides}} on soil urease was examined. Inhibition of urea hydrolysis, some 60 days after application of 1000 parts/ 106 of insecticide to a sandy clay loam, approached 40 % (accothion) and exceeded 50 % {{in the case}} of malathion and thimet. Similar inhibitory effects were recorded using a silt loam soil with which 200 parts/ 106 application also produced inhibition ranging from 14 % (accothion) to 23 % (thimet) after 10 days. With lower concentrations of insecticide (50 parts/ 106) inhibition, though again significant, was of a more ephemeral nature. All three insecticides, at a concentration of 1000 parts/ 10 + 6, prevented almost any hydrolysis of urea by jack bean urease. Ureolytic microorganisms, isolated from the soils under investigation, were inhibited by the organophosphates {{to a greater or lesser}} extent but the development of tolerance was common. It is suggested that the application of insecticides to control <b>soil-borne</b> <b>insect</b> pests may be a factor in determining the efficiency of urea fertilizer mineralization. © 1976...|$|E
40|$|Upland rice {{is mostly}} {{at risk from}} <b>soil-borne</b> <b>insect</b> pests, {{including}} termites, which cause significant crop yield losses. Studies were conducted in 2005 and 2006 at Ikenne, southwest Nigeria to assess the effectiveness of two traditional practices (cow dung and red palm oil mixed with pawpaw), two plant extracts (neem seed oil and neem powder) and Furadan coated with garri (cassava flour) against termite attacks on nine rice varieties—NERICAs 1 – 7, LAC 23 and OS 6. In 2005, {{the results showed that}} neem seed oil was more effective than neem powder and cow dung in the control of termites. Of the five treatments in 2006 (Furadan coated with garri, neem seed oil, neem powder, cow dung and red palm oil mixed with pawpaw), two treatments—neem seed oil and Furadan coated with garri—gave the best protection against termite attack. Among the rice varieties, termite attack was significantly lower on NERICA 5 than on the other NERICA varieties in both years. NERICA 5 was apparently the least attacked by termites when unprotected, indicating that it {{could be used as a}} resistant check variety for termites. Yield losses were lower in the treated than in the control plots. These findings indicate that botanicals, such as neem seed oil, can provide effective control against termites on rice fields and can also be used as alternatives to persistent chemical pesticides. This study has far-reaching implications because neem seed oil is environmentally safe, easy to prepare, readily available and affordable by resource-poor farmers in Nigeria. Peer Revie...|$|E

40|$|Keine Zusammenfassung in deutscher Sprache vorhanden.) 	 (No {{summary in}} German language.) Nematodes (Heterorhabditis bacteriophora) are {{successfully}} used in pest control of <b>soil-borne</b> <b>insects.</b> A substantial cost {{reduction in the}} production of nematodes is a prerequisite for vast application. The industrial production process starts with a pre-culture of their symbiotic bacterium (Photorhabdus luminescens). The conditions in that pre-culture are very decisive {{for the development of the}} nematodes. Model-based control strategies for cultivation of the bacteria are presented, which guarantee reproducible growth conditions. Based upon a system of non-linear differential equations, the dynamics of bacterial growth were described. One application shown is the implementation of a non-linear estimation method. This allows an online estimation of all relevant process variables. Using concepts and ideas from the theory of differentially flat systems, one can calculate substrate feed rates and design closed loop trajectory controllers. As concrete example, fed batch cultivations at lab-scale are presented. These show, that the application of model-based control leads to a reproducible bacterial growth with high cell densities...|$|R
40|$|Minnesota ranked fourth {{nationally in}} the {{production}} of dry edible beans during the 2000 growing season, with 150, 000 acres harvested. Dry edible beans (mostly navy and pinto) provide a relatively consistent source of income, and an excellent fit within the crop rotation systems of this area, typically small grains and corn. In 2000, total value of production was estimated at $ 42. 7 million. In addition to the direct value of this crop to growers in the central and northwest regions of our state, the crop provides to the processing industry, snap bean contracts between processors and growers assist in adding economic diversification for traditional corn and soybean growers in southern and west-central Minnesota. The high value of this crop, along with the potential for economic losses from insect, disease and weed pests, continue to create demand for effective integrated pest management (IPM) programs. In response to new IPM information needs generated by the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA), this profile was developed to a) summarize current IPM practices for insect, disease and weed pests, b) highlight pesticides under review by US-EPA, c) estimate the impact of the loss of selected pesticides, and d) assess alternatives for such losses. Insect Pests: Insect pests are usually the most damaging and difficult pests to control in dry edible beans, affecting either bean quality or yield. The most important insect pests include seed corn maggot and the potato leafhopper. Seed corn maggot (SCM), and other <b>soil-borne</b> <b>insect</b> pests such as white grubs and wireworms, can do considerable damage, resulting in uneven plant stands, and/or by causing delayed maturity. Potato leafhopper (PLH), if left unchecked will also caus...|$|E
40|$|Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is an {{organophosphate}} insecticide {{used primarily}} to control foliage and <b>soil-borne</b> <b>insect</b> pests {{on a variety}} of food and feed crops. In mammals, maternal exposure to CPF has been reported to induce dose-related abnormalities such as slower brain growth and cerebral cortex thinning. In lower vertebrates, for example, fish and amphibians, teratogenic activity of this compound is correlated with several anatomical alterations. Little is known about the effects of CPF on mRNA expression of genes involved in early development of the anatomical structures appearing abnormal in embryos. This study investigated the effects of exposure to different CPF concentrations (10, 15 and 20 mg/L) on Xenopus laevis embryos from stage 4 / 8 to stage 46. Some of the morphological changes we detected in CPF-exposed embryos included cranial neural crest cell (NCC) -derived structures. For this reason, we analyzed the expression of select genes involved in hindbrain patterning (egr 2), cranial neural crest chondrogenesis, and craniofacial development (fgf 8, bmp 4, sox 9, hoxa 2 and hoxb 2). We found that CPF exposure induced a reduction in transcription of all the genes involved in NCC-dependent chondrogenesis, with largest reductions in fgf 8 and sox 9; whereas, in hindbrain, we did not find any alterations in egr 2 expression. Changes in the expression of fgf 8, bmp 4, and sox 9, which are master regulators of several developmental pathways, have important implications. If these changes are confirmed to belong to a general pattern of alterations in vertebrates prenatally exposed to OP, they might be useful to assess damage during vertebrate embryo development.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} batch and fed-batch mass {{production}} of Steinernema carpocapsae. S. carpocapsae is an entomoparasitic nematode that {{is used as a}} biological control agent of <b>soil-borne</b> crop <b>insect</b> pests. The ability and efficiency of fed-batch culture process was successful through the utilization of the nematode’s bacterial symbiont Xenorhabdus nematophila. Results from the fed-batch process were compared to those obtain from the standard batch process. The fed-batch process successively improved the mass production process of S. carpocapsae employing liquid medium technology. Within {{the first week of the}} fed-batch process (day six), the nematode density obtained was 202, 000 nematodes mL − 1; whereas on day six, batch culture mode resulted in a nematode density of 23, 000 nematodes mL − 1. The fed-batch process was superior to that of batch production with a yield approximately 8. 8 -fold higher. In fed-batch process, the nematode yield was improved 88. 6 % higher within a short amount of time compared to the batch process. Fed-batch seems to make the process more efficient and possibly economically viable. </p...|$|R
5000|$|Two or more crops simultaneously: Non-competing crops, {{often with}} {{different}} maturity dates, are planted together in various patterns. Intercropping is one pattern approach; companion planting is a related, complementary practice. This method {{is also known}} as Interplanting: The practice of growing two types of plants in the same space. [...] Interplanting requires a certain amount of preplanning and knowledge of the maturity dates of different types of vegetables. It has been noted that successful interplanting and intensive gardening is done in raised beds within the planting areas. Planting two or more non-competing crops may raise issues with <b>soil-borne</b> diseases and <b>insects</b> that only affect one type of plant. Depending on how close the interplanting varieties are, crop failure is a possibility.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} were conducted to determine the potential of a new method of steam treatment for the control of <b>soil-borne</b> diseases, <b>insects</b> and weeds in sustainable crop production.   The new method involved rapidly heating a bed of prepared soil on a porous base by passing an upward flow of steam through it.   The aim {{was to determine whether}} the new method would be suitable for use in a field machine, making large-scale field steaming practically and economically viable. In the first experiments, the feasibility of the new method was tested.   It was shown that it was an effective and rapid way in which a soil bed could be steamed.   However, for some soils at, or near, permanent wilting point, the entrainment of aggregates in the steam flow was shown to be a problem.   The second {{series of experiments}} showed that the key factor determining the flow rate at which aggregate entrainment occurred was the mean aggregate diameter of the soil being treated.   The third series of experiments examined the rate at which heated soil would cool when placed in the field.   It was shown that where there was contact with unheated field soil, cooling was very rapid.   The final series of experiments investigated the effects of the new steaming method on the soil.   A three minute steaming time was used to account for the short time it had been shown some of the heated soil would remain at steam temperature when replaced in the field.   The effects of the new method, including the effectiveness of disinfection, were shown to be similar to those of a conventional steam treatment. It was concluded that the new steaming method was an effective way to steam treat soil and should be suitable for use in a field machine.

30|$|Currently, soil {{treatment}} with soil-borne pathogen-effective methyl bromide, which {{can result in}} several fold increase in strawberry yields over that of nonchemical methods in USA (Noling 2016), is still applied by some small-scale growers in Egypt. Instead of its legal utilization against wood borer pests, MB is sometimes illegally, though effectively, used against nematodes, <b>soil-borne</b> pathogens, and <b>insect</b> pests in strawberry nurseries/fields. On the contrary, a significant re-direction in the types and choice of applicable pesticides is being adopted by medium and large companies in Egypt due to environmental issues obstructing {{the use of such}} hazardous chemicals. In this vein, 1, 3 -dichloropropene, or its commercial synonyms such as Telone II or Dorlone II, is widely applied in nurseries/fields for its high PPN control efficacy. Moreover, since chloropicrin has proved to be very effective against diseases but seldom nematodes or weeds, 1, 3 -dichloropropene is also formulated with chloropicrin (Telone C 17 or Telone C 35), making it a multi-purpose soil fumigant (Abd-Elgawad 2008). The product contains either 17 % or 35 % chloropicrin. Telone C 35, applied in combination with a separately applied herbicide or fumigant product for weed control, has been identified as the best chemical alternative replacing MB for achieving effective PPN control and superior strawberry production (Noling 2016). Application rates of fumigant nematicides for strawberries are 27 – 35 [*]gal/acre (or 127.4 – 165.2 [*]l/Feddan) for Telone II and 39 – 50 [*]gal/acre (or 184 – 236 [*]l/Feddan) for Telone C 35 (Feddan[*]=[*] 4200 [*]m 2). Appropriate soil preparation and conditions prior to plant fumigation, new fumigant product and applicator training certifications, personal protective equipment, buffer zones, mandatory good application practices, and other restrictions and requirements were recently highlighted (Noling 2016).|$|R
