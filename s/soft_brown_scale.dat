50|$|In South Africa, {{the most}} {{troublesome}} diseases are powdery mildew and <b>soft</b> <b>brown</b> <b>scale.</b> The plants {{are prone to}} root rots and viruses if on poorly drained soil or if carried over to a second year. Therefore, farmers favor biennial plantings. Bacterial leaf spot (Xanthomonas spp.) occurs in Queensland. A strain of tobacco mosaic virus may affect plants in India. In New Zealand, plants can be infected by Candidatus liberibacter subsp. solanacearum.|$|E
40|$|The {{commercial}} {{planting of}} boronia (Boroniu inegastigma Nees), which {{is native to}} Western Australia, was established as an essential oil crop in Tasmania in 1985. In general, intensive cultural or monocultural practices are vulnerable to pest problems {{due to lack of}} species diversity. While psyllid pests have now been controlled, scale insects have become a serious pest in some boronia growers fields. Two soft scale insects (Hemiptera: Coccidae) attack boronia and have been identified as the black scale, Saissetiu oleae Oliver, and <b>soft</b> <b>brown</b> <b>scale</b> Coccus hesperidum L. At this time, black scale is considered the most serious pest in commercial plantations despite the occurrence of many natural enemies. Similarly, black scale on citrus in California USA, has remained a problem despite a complex of parasitoids and the repeated importation of new natural enemies (Daane and Caltagirone, 1990; Lampson and Morse, 1992). Saissetia oleue is an occasional pest insect and its distribution is mainly in temperate and sub-tropical regions. Daane and Caltagirone (1990) noted that it is common for orchards to have repeated outbreaks while neighbouring orchards do not. Black scale occurs throughout Australia with South Australia, New South Wales, and Victoria more affected due to their large citrus growing areas (Wilson, 1960). <b>Soft</b> <b>brown</b> <b>scale</b> is of European origin (McLeod and Coppel, 1966). It is now common in all tropical and subtropical regions of the world and in greenhouses in cooler regions (Ebeling, 1959; McLeod et al, 1966). Again, South Australia, Western Australia and New South Wales are more affected because of their large citrus growing areas (Wilson, 1960). Both scale species, S. oleue and C. hesperidum, are known to have a wide range of host plants. When heavily infested parts of the plant, such as foliage, shoots and fruit, are covered with sooty mould that develops on honeydew excreted by scale insects. Damage to the plant can be either direct, i. e. by sucking sap from the plant or indirect, i. e. by covering parts of the plant with sooty mould that interferes with the efficiency of photosynthesis. Heavy infestation can result in defoliation, fruit drop, twig dieback and in extreme cases, death of the plants (Ebeling, 1959). The application of insecticides to control scale insects without accurate knowledge of pest population control mechanisms could disrupt any potential regulation by natural enemies (Denach and Rosen, 1991; Paraskakis et al 1980). Hely et al. (1982) and Beattie (1991) suggested that application of insecticides against scale insects must be applied at an appropriate time and place in order to get effective results. Boronia growers in Tasmania have relied on materials such as petroleum spray oils and a mixture of these petroleum spray oils with maldison to control black scale and <b>soft</b> <b>brown</b> <b>scale</b> without any sound knowledge of their biology and ecology. This has led to unsuccessful results even though multiple applications have been employed annually. The aim {{of this study was to}} gain an understanding of the population dynamics and the life-cycle of both scale species, to understand their biology and to assess a range of insecticides for possible incorporation into an integrated program to control these species...|$|E
40|$|Several ant {{species may}} be {{associated}} with the same honeydew producing insect in citrus orchards. Recently antagonism and competition between two such ants were reported from Letaba. This report stimulated the present study, the purpose of which is to ascertain which ant species are most numerous in citrus orchards ln the Eastern Cape Province; the reasons for these ants being able to occupy orchards; and, finally, their relationships. A survey of the Sundays River Valley and the Fish River Valley revealed that three species - Anoplolepis custodiens Smith, Anoplolepis steingroeveri Forel, and Pheidole megacephala Fabricius - were commonly found in citrus orchards in association with <b>Soft</b> <b>Brown</b> <b>Scale</b> insects. The territorial relationships of these ants were determined by plotting their distribution at intervals for over a year. It was found that this distribution could be correlated with seasonal climatic conditions, the effects of farming practices, brood rearing requirements and behavioural differences between the three species. The ant, A. steingroeveri, had not been previously studied, and since foraging {{is an integral part of}} territorial behaviour, some aspects of its biology, and more especially its foraging activity, were investigated to compare it with the known biology of the other two species. Observations on the foraging activity of A. steingroeveri were made at monthly lntervals for almost a year, and correlated with climatic conditions prevailing at the time. Some seasonal and dally variations in foraging behaviour could not be readily explained in terms of the effects of temperature and humidity on the ants. Other factors, includ 1 ng trophallactic stimulation and overcast skies, were found to influence ant activity. Owing to the apparent lack of information in the literature and possibility of periodic honeydew production by <b>Soft</b> <b>Brown</b> <b>Scale</b> insects controlling ant activity was investigated in the laboratory. The results of this study showed that it was not likely that honeydew excretion restricted the activity of the ants. Several investigators have also found that many interrelated climatic factors correlated with ant foraging behaviour, but have expressed dissatisfaction at not being able to reach the crux of the matter. To clarify the issue a constant temperature chamber was constructed in which a colony of Crematogaster ants was housed and the ants were subjected to a series of temperatures at different humidities, all other factors were eliminated or kept constant. The effects of these two factors on the thermokinetics and foraging activity of the ants were registered. This thesis contains several sections and at the end of each the results are discussed in the light of the available literature and comparisons are drawn between the species under investigation. The main results are given in the summary. After the summary two appendices are included. One is an attempt to compare the effect on ant size of the honeydew diet of orchard colonies with the proteinaceoue diet of veld ants. The other appendix is an experiment to control citrus ants with an insecticide...|$|E
50|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> is polyphagous, {{meaning it}} feeds on {{many species of}} plants. It attacks {{a wide variety of}} crops, {{ornamental}} and greenhouse plants. In Hawaii, host plants include citrus, loquat, papaya, rubber trees and orchids.|$|R

40|$|Metaphycus sp. nr. flavus (Encyrtidae: Hymenoptera) is a {{parasitoid}} species {{collected from}} the Mediterranean region which lays its eggs in the immature stages of several economically important soft scale insects (Hemiptera: Coccidae), including <b>brown</b> <b>soft</b> <b>scale,</b> Coccus hesperidum L. (= host insect). Preliminary tests suggested that the parasitoid is most successful in producing offspring when it oviposits in the younger stages of <b>brown</b> <b>soft</b> <b>scale.</b> In Y-olfactometer bioassays measuring wasp choices and residence times, na√Øve parasitoids were significantly more attracted to yucca leaves infested with 26, 27, or 28 d-old scale than to uninfested leaves, whereas leaves with older (29 - 30 d-old) scale were no more attractive than uninfested leaves. Parasitoids also spent significantly {{more time in the}} arm with yucca leaves infested with 26 d-old scale than in the arm with uninfested leaves. These results are consistent with observations of the parasitoid's reproductive success on scale of different ages, whereby older scale are more likely to encapsulate the developing eggs of M. sp. nr. flavus females than are younger scale. Further bioassays determined that yucca leaves that had been infested with 26 d-old scale but from which the scale had been removed were as attractive as infested leaves. In contrast, infested yucca leaves from which scale had been removed and the leaves subsequently washed with distilled water were less attractive than infested leaves. Furthermore, the wash water containing scale residues was attractive to female wasps. In total, these results suggest that Metaphycus sp. nr. flavus females utilize volatile, water soluble compounds produced by <b>brown</b> <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> as cues to locate suitable hosts...|$|R
50|$|The adult female {{scale insect}} is oval and dome-shaped, about 3 to 5 mm long. It retains its legs and {{antennae}} throughout its life. Its cuticle {{is made of}} chitin {{but it does not}} produce the copious quantities of wax that armoured scales do. It is a pale yellowish-brown or greenish-brown colour with brown irregular speckles, and darkens with age. Male <b>brown</b> <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> insects are rarely found.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} obtain all the {{nutrients}} they need, the scale insects ingest large quantities of sap. They then secrete the excess sugary fluid as honeydew. This is attractive to ants which often tend the scale insects, driving away predators. The <b>brown</b> <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> does not normally kill the host plant, but the loss of sap probably causes it to grow more slowly and crop less heavily. The main disadvantage to the host is the sooty mould which grows on the honeydew. This reduces the area of leaf available for photosynthesis, and spoils {{the appearance of the}} plant, its flowers and fruits.|$|R
40|$|Changes {{in the red}} tonal {{response}} of Kodak Ektrachrome Infrared Aero 8443 film (EIR) are often incorrectly attributed solely to variations in infrared light reflectance of plant leaves, when the primary influence is a difference in visible light reflectance induced by varying chlorophyll contents. Comparisons are made among aerial photographic images of high- and low-chlorophyll foliage. New growth, foot rot, and boron and chloride nutrient toxicites produce low-chlorophyll foliage, and EIR transparency images of light red or white compared with dark-red images of high-chlorophyll foliage. Deposits of the sooty mold fungus that subsists on the honeydew produced by <b>brown</b> <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> insects, obscure the citrus leaves' green color. Infected trees appear as black images on EIR film transparencies compared with red images of healthy trees...|$|R
50|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> is {{ovoviviparous}} {{and produces}} young by parthenogenesis. Over {{the course of}} her life, the female may produce up to 250 eggs, a few being laid each day. The eggs are retained inside the insect until they hatch, at which time small nymphs emerge and are brooded for a few hours before dispersing. These first-stage nymphs are known as crawlers and move a short distance from the mother before settling and starting to feed. They have piercing and sucking mouthparts and feed on the host plant's sap. They are largely sedentary {{for the rest of their}} lives and pass through two more nymphal stages before becoming adults. A generation takes about two months, and there may be three to seven generations in a year, depending on temperature. Males are occasionally produced and these pass through four nymphal stages before becoming winged adults.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, <b>brown</b> <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> {{has been}} {{controlled}} {{by the use of}} pesticides, but these have the disadvantage that other insects, friends and foes alike, are also killed. Another approach in citrus is to eliminate ants from the trees, either by preventing the ants from climbing the trunks or by destroying their nests. This allows natural predators to flourish and keep the scale insects under control, although this may lead to an increase in the production of sooty mould. Fungicides can be used to prevent the sooty mould from taking hold. Alternatively, the use of such entomopathogenic fungi, such as Verticillium lecanii, has been successfully used under glass. An alternative approach is integrated pest management in which the natural enemies of the scale insects are encouraged. A further possibility is the use of growth regulators such as the hormone hydroprene which disrupts the moulting of juvenile scale insects.|$|R
40|$|A {{computer}} software system is described that uses digitized color information from aerial color infrared transparencies {{to detect the}} a presence of citrus mealybug (Pseudococcus citri Risso), <b>brown</b> <b>soft</b> <b>scale</b> (Coccus hesperidum L.), and Rio Grande gummosis in individual citrus trees. The color coordinates at each spatial point, and color differences at adjacent points are used to locate the trees and to detect the infestations; and compensation is made for the variation in color characteristics between different transparencies. The system requires the input of four parameters: a flag denoting the presence of heavy shadows in the image, nominal tree size and spacing of the citrus trees, and a flag denoting the season {{of the year when}} the transparency was taken. An index of recognition, Iq, was defined and used as a measure of recognition effectiveness. For unknown data, Iq ranged from 43 % to 81 %, with nominal values of 60 % to 80 % for all three infestations...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a {{system designed to}} analyze aerial color infrared photographs of citrus orchards. The input to the system is a 35 mm transparency of the infrared aerial photograph mounted in a 3 -color film digitizer which is controlled by an XDS 930 computer. An algorithm locates the outline of each individual tree in the photograph and then cluster analysis is applied. For the trees of a transparency, centre of gravity (C. G.) of the set of these trees is determined and then the distance of each individual tree from C. G. is computed by using an empirical distance function which we have derived. Sorting, performed {{on the basis of}} the computed distances, clusters the trees. The cluster identifying algorithm separates out the individual clusters which are then grouped together into a smaller number of classes by applying the same algorithm. Fifteen transparencies having mealybugs, <b>brown</b> <b>soft</b> <b>scale,</b> gummosis and root rot infestations, were analyzed and experimental results show very satisfactory classification of the infestations...|$|R
