The flow is first stabilized and then gradually destabilized as the cylinder varies from square to circular geometry. The sensitivity analysis reveals that the variation of stability is attributed to the different spatial variation trends of the backflow velocity in the near- and far-wake regions for various cylinder geometries. The results from the stability analysis are also verified with those of the direct simulations and very good agreement is achieved...|$|E

40|$|Dedicated to Professor Zhong-ci Shi on the {{occasion}} of his 70 th birthday We propose a simple numerical method for calculating both unsteady and steady state solution of hyperbolic system with geometrical source terms having concentrations. Phys-ical problems under consideration include the shallow water equations with topography, and the quasi one-dimensional nozzle flows. We use the interface value, rather than the cell-averages, for the source terms, which results in a well-balanced scheme that can cap-ture the steady state solution with a remarkable accuracy. This method approximates the source terms via the numerical fluxes produced by an (approximate) Riemann solver for the homogeneous hyperbolic systems with slight additional computation complexity using Newton’s iterations and numerical integrations. This method solves well the sub-or <b>super-critical</b> <b>flows,</b> and with a transonic fix, also handles well the transonic flows over the concentration.

The analysis of the perturbation energy past the obstacle shows that the varicose mode of instability is always dominant in the close proximity of the obstacle, and it promotes transition in <b>super-critical</b> <b>flow</b> cases.

Vertical acceleration plays a dominant role in the spillway flows. This paper describes the formulation and development of a numerical model for flow over the spillway. The computer model is developed using the finite volume method based on weakly compressible flow equations and large Eddy simulation (LES) -based turbulence model. The model is applied to a real world case study of partial gate operation of sluice spillway to investigate the hydraulic characteristics by simulating the velocity distribution, pressure distribution and discharge characteristics. Numerical modelling of sluice spillway is complicated because both moving free surface region and fixed conduit pressure flow in the sluice barrel are present.

40|$|Ploughed upland drains are {{straight}} prismatic channels of low aspect ratio. The drains are either uniformly or compositely roughened. In compositely roughened drains {{the bed and}} side-walls are differentially roughened although each roughness type is homogeneous. Upland catchments, containing extensive ploughed drainage networks, are particularly prone to flash flooding and increased sediment yield. However, the basic hydraulic data necessary to route flow through the drainage network and improve the engineering design of stable drainage channels are currently unavailable. A logarithmic flow resistance equation is developed for low aspect ratio channels, where the effective Nikuradse equivalent grain size is known. Testing against field data indicates that the relationship successfully predicts the resistance to uniform flow through upland drains. The performance of eight composite roughness formulae to predict the mean velocity in differentially roughened channels is compared. The composite roughness equations involve dividing the cross-sectional flow area {{into a number of}} sub-areas. The different methods of cross-sectional area division are considered and their effect on mean velocity prediction examined. Preferences are indicated concerning composite roughness equations which predict the mean velocity in channels of simple cross-sectional shape. Empirical equations are derived to determine the mean bed and side-wall shear stresses in straight symmetrical trapezoidal and rectangular open channels, with uniform or composite roughness. The model proposed is appropriate for stable sub-critical and <b>super-critical</b> <b>flows.</b> The equations are based on data collected from laboratory channels and should be cautiously applied to larger scale channels.

40|$|One of {{the most}} useful methods to {{estimate}} the black hole mass in X-ray binaries (XBs), when the dynamical method is unavailable, is by X-ray spectral fitting. The most well-known fitting model for black hole binaries (BHBs) is the disk blackbody (DBB) model, in which the effective temperature profile {{is assumed to be}} Teff ∝ r − 3 / 4, where r is the disk radius. It has two fitting parameters: the innermost disk temperature, Tin, and the innermost radius, rin. For a non-rotating black hole, its mass can be estimated by assuming that the innermost radius coincides with rin = 3 rg(∝M), where rg is the Schwarzschild radius. However, this conventional method does not give an accurate mass for <b>super-critical</b> accretion <b>flow,</b> in which both of the innermost radius and temperature profile are modified from those of the sub-critical flow. We, here, propose a methodology to derive a black hole mass for the <b>super-critical</b> accretion <b>flow.</b> In this method, we use, as a spectral fitting model, the extended DBB model, in which an effective temperature profile obeys the relation, Teff ∝r −p, with the temperature gradient, p, being treated as a fitting parameter (in addition to two others; Tin and rin). We first calculate theoretical flow structure and its spectra for given black hole mass and accretion rate, M and ˙ M.

This model computes water depth and velocity components in horizontal plane using shallow water continuity and equations motion in horizontal plane. This model evaluates two-dimensional velocity patterns and shockwaves. The governing equations are discretized utilizing over lapping cell vertex finite volume method on triangular unstructured meshes. The numerical oscillations of explicit solution procedure are damped out using either artificial viscosity scheme or upwind averaging fluxes at control volume boundary edges. The algorithm of evaluation of the fluxes at edges and artificial dissipation terms at nodes is adopted for unstructured meshes. Using both techniques, no additional dissipation is introduced to the computed flow and shockwaves are simulated accurately. The efficiency of the model is improved using edge base data structure for addressing unstructured mesh details.

40|$|The present {{experimental}} work {{is concerned with}} the study of amplitude dependent acoustic response of an isothermal coaxial swirling jet. The excitation amplitude is increased in five distinct steps at the burner's Helmholtz resonator mode (i. e., 100 Hz). Two flow states are compared, namely, sub-critical and super-critical vortex breakdown (VB) that occur before and after the critical conical sheet breakdown, respectively. The geometric swirl number is varied in the range 2. 14 - 4. 03. Under the influence of external pulsing, global response characteristics are studied based on the topological changes observed in time-averaged 2 D flow field. These are obtained from high resolution 2 D PIV (particle image velocimetry) in the longitudinal-mid plane. PIV results also illustrate the changes in the normalized vortex core coordinates (r(vcc) /(r(vcc)) (0) (Hz), y(vcc) /(y(vcc)) (0) (Hz)) of internal recirculation zone (IRZ). A strong forced response is observed at 100 Hz (excitation frequency) in the convectively unstable region which get amplified based on the magnitude of external forcing. The radial extent of this forced response region at a given excitation amplitude is represented by the acoustic response region (b). The topological placement of the responsive convectively unstable region is a function of both the intensity of imparted swirl (characterized by swirl number) and forcing amplitude. It is observed that for sub-critical VB mode, an increase in the excitation amplitude till a critical value shifts the vortex core centre (particularly, the vortex core moves downstream and radially outwards) leading to drastic fanning-out/widening of the IRZ. This is accompanied by similar to 30 % reduction in the recirculation velocity of the IRZ. It is also observed that b = R. In contrast, the vortex core of super-critical breakdown mode consistently spreads radially outwards and is displaced further downstream. Finally, the IRZ fans-out at the threshold excitation amplitude. However, the acoustic response region b is still less than R. This is explained based on the characteristic geometric swirl number (S-G) of the flow regimes. The <b>super-critical</b> <b>flow</b> mode with higher S-G (hence, higher radial pressure drop due to rotational effect which scales as Delta P similar to rho u theta(2) and acts inwards towards the center line) compared to sub-critical state imposes a greater resistance to the radial outward spread of b. As a result, the acoustic energy supplied to the <b>super-critical</b> <b>flow</b> mode increases the degree of acoustic response at the pulsing frequency and energizes its harmonics (evident from power spectra). As a disturbance amplifier, the stronger convective instability mode within the flow structure of super-critical VB causes the topology to widen/fan-out severely at threshold excitation amplitude.

30|$|A new reduced order model (ROM) is {{proposed}} here for reconstructing <b>super-critical</b> <b>flow</b> past circular cylinder and lid driven cavity using time-scaling of vorticity data directly.

In the present method, we propose a novel ROM that uses relation between Strouhal number (St) and Reynolds number (Re). We provide a step by step approach for this new ROM for any Re and is a general procedure with vorticity data requiring very limited storage {{as well as being}} extremely fast. We emphasize on the scientific aspects of developing ROM by taking data from close proximity of the target Re to produce DNS-quality reconstruction, while the applied aspect is also shown. All the donor points need not be immediate neighbors and the reconstructed solution has equivalent relaxed accuracy. However, one would restrain the range where the flow behavior is coherent between donors. The reported work is a proof of concept utilizing the external and internal flow examples, and this can be extended for other flows characterized by appropriate Re–St data.|$|E
40|$|Critical depth is {{the depth}} {{at which the}} flow in an open conduit {{undergoes}} a transition between supercritical and subcritical regimes. While the prediction of critical depth in a prismatic channel can be achieved to a high accuracy, the same cannot be said for two stage channels (main channel with flanking floodplain), also commonly known as compound channels. Traditionally, critical depth in a compound channel is predicted based on minimum specific energy. This investigation has shown that flow in compound channels does not undergo a sharp critical flow transition as in prismatic channels. Instead, the change between fully subcritical and fully super-critical occurs over a depth range, whereby different regions in the cross-section maybe either sub or <b>super-critical</b> <b>flow.</b> This has been termed a "mixed-flow" region.

40|$|The quasi-steady {{structure}} of super-critical accretion flows around {{a black hole}} is studied based on the two-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamical (2 D-RHD) simulations. The <b>super-critical</b> <b>flow</b> is composed of two parts: the disk region and the outflow regions {{above and below the}} disk. Within the disk region the circular motion as well as the patchy density structure are observed, which is caused by Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and probably by convection. The mass-accretion rate decreases inward, roughly in proportion to the radius, and the remaining part of the disk material leaves the disk to form outflow because of strong radiation pressure force. We confirm that photon trapping plays an important role within the disk. Thus, matter can fall onto the black hole at a rate exceeding the Eddington rate. The emission is highly anisotropic and moderately collimated so that the apparent luminosity can exceed the Eddington luminosity by a factor of a few in the face-on view. The mass-accretion rate onto the black hole increases with increase of the absorption opacity (metalicity) of the accreting matter. This implies that the black hole tends to grow up faster in the metal rich regions as in starburst galaxies or star-forming regions.

It is shown that in many cases knowledge of the Froude number of the undisturbed approaching flow and of a geometric character-istic of the obstacle allows for a reliable prediction of the flow state.

Three different obstacles in a rectangular channel are considered, namely a sill, a vertical sluice gate, and a circular cylinder, and the theoretical boundaries of the hysteresis region are specified for each obstacle. The experimental results show that the theoretical predictions are consistent with experiments in the case of obstacles that do not affect channel width (i. e. sills and gates). On the contrary, in the case of channel contraction, a further parameter, which the presented theory does not account for, was found to affect the behavior of the flow, namely the ratio of undisturbed flow depth to contraction width.

40|$|By {{performing}} two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations {{with a large}} computational {{domain of}} 5000 times the Schwarzschild radius, we revealed that wide-angle outflow is launched via the radiation force from the <b>super-critical</b> accretion <b>flows</b> around black holes. The angular size of the outflow, where the radial velocity (v(r)) exceeds the escape velocity (v(esc)), increases with an increase of {{the distance from the}} black hole. As a result, the mass is blown away with speed of v(r) > v(esc) in all directions except for {{in the vicinity of the}} equatorial plane, theta = 0 degrees- 85 degrees, where theta is the polar angle. The mass ejected from the outer boundary per unit time by the outflow is larger than the mass accretion rate onto the black hole, similar to 150 L-Edd/c(2), where L-Edd and c are the Eddington luminosity and the speed of light. The kinetic power of such wide-angle high-velocity outflow is comparable to the photon luminosity and is a few times larger than the Eddington luminosity. This corresponds to similar to 10 (39) - 10 (40) erg s(- 1) for the stellar mass black holes.

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} large-eddy simulation (LES) {{model was}} used to examine how stratified flow interacts with bottom obstacles in the coastal ocean. Bottom terrain representing a 2 D ridge was modeled using a finite-volume approach with ridge height (4. 5 m) and width (; 30 m) and water depth (; 45 m) appropriate for coastal regions. Temperature and salinity profiles representative of coastal conditions giving constant buoyancy frequency were applied with flow velocities between 0. 16 and 0. 4 m s 21. Simulations using a free-slip lower boundary yielded flow responses ranging from transition flows with relatively high internal wave pressure drag to <b>super-critical</b> <b>flow</b> with relatively small internal wave drag. Cases with high wave drag exhibited strong lee-wave systems with wavelength of; 100 m and regions of turbulent overturning. Application of bottom drag caused a 5 – 10 -m-thick bottom boundary layer to form, which greatly reduced the strength of lee-wave systems in the transition cases. A final simulation with bottom drag, but with a much larger obstacle height (16 m) and width (; 400 m), produced a stronger lee-wave response, indicating that large obstacle flow is not influenced as much by bottom roughness. Flow characteristics for the larger obstacle were more similar to hydraulic flow, with lee waves that are relatively short in comparison with the obstacle width. The relatively strong effect of bottom roughness on the small obstacle wave drag suggests that small-scale bottom variations may be ignored in internal wave drag parameterizations. However, the more significant wave drag from larger-scale obstacles must still be considered and may be responsible for mixing and momentum transfer at distances far from the obstacle source. 1...|$|E
40|$|Impressed by a {{widespread}} {{misunderstanding of the}} issue, {{we return to the}} old question concerning the location of the inner edge of the accretion disk around a black hole. We recall the fundamental results obtained in the 1970 ’s and 1980 ’s by Warsaw and Kyoto research groups that proved, in particular, that the inner edge does not coincide with the location of the innermost stable Keplerian circular orbit. We give some novel illustrations of this particular point and of some other fundamental results obtained before. To investigate the flow dynamics of the inner edge of an accretion disk, we carefully solved the structure of the transonic flow and plotted the effective potential profile based on the angular-momentum distribution calculated numerically. We showed that the flow does not have a potential minimum for accretion rates, M ̇ 10 LE/c 2 (with LE being the Eddington luminosity and c being the speed of light). This property is realized even for relatively small viscosity parameters (i. e., α ∼ 0. 01), because of the effect of the pressure gradient. In conclusion, an argument based on the last circular orbit of a test particle cannot give a correct inner boundary of the <b>super-critical</b> <b>flow,</b> and the inner edge should be determined in connection with radiation efficiency. The same argument can apply to optically thin ADAF. The interpretation of the observed QPO frequencies should be re-considered, since the assumption of a Keplerian rotation velocity can grossly over- or underestimate the disk rotation velocity, depending on the magnitude of the viscosity.

40|$|Within (food) industry, {{blending}} {{is often}} used to obtain the desired product properties. Besides the material properties of the phases, the rheology of the final product largely depends on the micro-structure formed during processing. This micro-structure is the result of coalescence and break-up of the dispersed phase during processing. The latter has been studied extensively for Newtonian two-phase systems in quasi-steady, linear 2 D flows, resulting in a 'Grace'-curve [1]. Given the interfacial tension and the viscosities, this curve defines for quasi-steady flows the critical shear rate at which a stable drop shape ceases to exist, leading to break-up. However, the flow conditions encountered by the blends, both during the initial mixing and in the subsequent processing equipment, are usually not quasi-steady, and the phases are often visco-elastic. Thorough investigation of a time-dependent break-up process has been performed by Stone, Bentley and Leal [2 - 3], who subjected Newtonian drops to step-wise changes in flow conditions. In the present study, the break-up behavior in a more realistic, although still simplified flow is analyzed. To this end, a single droplet is subjected to a Newtonian, hyperbolic flow, applying a triangular strain rate - time profile, comparable to the profile applied by de Bruijn in simple shear [4]; the strain rate is increased monotonically at a certain finite rate from zero to a <b>super-critical</b> <b>flow,</b> after which the flow rate is decreased at the same rate to zero. The deformation of the droplet and the occurrence of break-up depend on the time interval during which the critical capillary number is exceeded, as well as the magnitude of this excess. In addition, preliminary results will be presented on deformation and break-up of visco-elastic drops in hyperbolic Newtonian flow, showing a separate influence of the characteristic time of the flow and the elongation rate...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 A {{wind tunnel}} {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} compare the flight path characteristics and drag of current models of volleyballs. An open circuit low speed wind tunnel was primarily used to gather lift and drag data on multiple models of volleyballs in <b>super-critical</b> Reynolds number <b>flows.</b> The models tested were the Baden VX 5 E- 01, Baden VX 450 C- 230, Baden VX 450 - 02, Mikasa MVA 200, and Molten V 5 M 5000. Analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between cavity dimensions on the balls and the lift and drag characteristics of the balls. Conditions were based on indoor volleyball conditions set by the International Federation of Volleyball (FIVB) with Reynolds numbers ranging from 2 x 105 to 4. 3 x 105. Recommendations were provided for future designs of volleyballs to improve aerodynamic performance...|$|R
40|$|A {{practical}} {{design tool}} {{for the analysis of}} flowfields near the injector face has been developed and used to analyze the Fastrac engine. The objective was to produce a computational design tool which was detailed enough to predict the interactive effects of injector element impingement angles and points and the momenta of the individual orifice flows. To obtain a model which could be used to simulate a significant number of individual orifices, a homogeneous computational fluid dynamics model was developed. To describe liquid and vapor sub- and <b>super-critical</b> <b>flows,</b> the model included thermal and caloric equations of state which were valid over a wide range of pressures and temperatures. A homogeneous model was constructed such that the local state of the flow was determined directly, i. e. the quality of the flow was calculated. Such a model does not identify drops or their distribution, but it does allow the flow along the injector face and into the acoustic cavity to be predicted. It also allows the film coolant flow to be accurately described. The initial evaluation of the injector code was made by simulating cold flow from an unlike injector element and from a like-on-like overlapping fan (LOL) injector element. The predicted mass flux distributions of these injector elements compared well to cold flow test results. These are the same cold flow tests which serve as the data base for the JANNAF performance prediction codes. The flux distributions 1 inch downstream of the injector face are very similar; the differences were somewhat larger at further distances from the faceplate. Since the cold flow testing did not achieve good mass balances when integrations across the entire fan were made, the CFD simulation appears to be reasonable alternative to future cold flow testing. To simulate the Fastrac, an RP- 1 /LOX combustion model must be chosen. This submodel must be relatively simple to accomplish three-dimensional, multiphase flow simulations. Single RP- 1 pyrolysis and partial oxidation steps were chosen and the combustion was completed with the wet CO mechanism. Soot was also formed with a single global reaction. To validate the combustion submodel, global data from gas generator tests and from subscale motor test were used to predict qualitatively correct mean molecular weights, temperature, and soot levels. Because such tests do not provide general kinetics rates, the methodology is not necessarily appropriate for other than rocket type flows conditions. Soot predictions were made so that radiation heating to the motor walls can be made. These initial studies of the Fastrac were for a small region close to the injector face and chamber wall which included a segment of the acoustic cavity. The region analyzed includes 11 individual orifice holes to represent the LOL elements and the H 2 film coolant holes. Typical results of this simulation are shown in Figure 1. At this point the only available test data to verify the predictions are temperatures measured in the acoustic cavity. These temperatures are in reasonable agreement at about 2000 R (1111 K). Future work is expected to include improving the computational efficiency or the CFD model and/or using more computer capacity than the single Pentium PC with which these simulations were made...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{methodology}} to derive a black-hole mass for <b>super-critical</b> accretion <b>flow.</b> Here, {{we use the}} extended disk blackbody (extended DBB) model, a fitting model in which the effective temperature profile obeys the relation T_ eff∝ r^-p, with r being the disk radius and p being treated as a fitting parameter. We first numerically calculate the theoretical flow structure and its spectra for a given black-hole mass, M, and accretion rate, Ṁ. Through fitting to the theoretical spectra by the extended DBB model, we can estimate the black-hole mass, M_ x, assuming that the innermost disk radius is r_ in= 3 r_ g (∝ M_ x), where r_ g is the Schwarzschild radius. We find, however, that the estimated mass deviates from that adopted in the spectral calculations, M, even for low-Ṁ cases. We also find that the deviations can be eliminated by introducing a new correction for the innermost radius. Using this correction, we calculate mass correction factors, M/M_ x, in the super-critical regimes for some sets of M and Ṁ, finding that a mass correction factor ranges between M/M_ x∼ 1. 2 [...] 1. 6. The higher is Ṁ, the larger does the mass correction factor tend to be. Since the correction is relatively small, we can safely conclude that the black holes in ULXs which Vierdayanti et al. (2006, PASJ, 58, 915) analyzed are stellar-mass black holes with the mass being < 100 M_. Comment: 14 pages, 9 figures, 6 tables (accepted, PASJ, Vol. 60 No. 3).
