5000|$|Box <b>sealing</b> <b>tape,</b> pressure-sensitive-taps are {{available}} in various widths i.e. 36, 48, and 72 mm widths and several thicknesses. BOPP and PET are used as a backings. Taping is done either manually or by semi automatic machine.|$|R
50|$|During World War II, Revolite (then a {{division}} of Johnson & Johnson) developed an adhesive tape made from a rubber-based adhesive applied to a durable duck cloth backing. This tape resisted water and was used as <b>sealing</b> <b>tape</b> on some ammunition cases during that period.|$|R
50|$|Effects on {{recyclability}} {{are particularly}} important when tape is applied to paper surfaces, such as corrugated fiberboard and other packaging. When taped corrugated boxes are recycled, film-backed box <b>sealing</b> <b>tapes</b> do not hinder box recycling: the PSA adhesive stays with the backing and is easily removed.|$|R
50|$|Threaded pipe joints {{are sealed}} with thread <b>seal</b> <b>tape</b> or pipe dope. Many {{plumbing}} fixtures are sealed to their mounting surfaces with plumber's putty.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "plumber's tape" [...] {{has been}} applied to thread <b>seal</b> <b>tape</b> in recent years. In the {{plumbing}} trade, plumber's tape is the name given to a strap of material with holes in it used for supporting pipes and fixtures.|$|E
5000|$|In a bind, master {{plumbers}} {{have been}} known to replicate the sealing action of a ferrule by using an artfully [...] "woven" [...] piece of thread <b>seal</b> <b>tape.</b> This is attempted as a temporary solution to prevent a leak until a proper ferrule can be procured.|$|E
5000|$|A {{case sealer}} or box sealer {{is a piece}} of {{equipment}} used for closing or sealing corrugated boxes. It is most commonly used for regular slotted containers (RSC) and can involve adhesive (cold water-borne or hot melt adhesive), box <b>sealing</b> <b>tape,</b> or [...] Gummed (water activated) tape.|$|R
5000|$|Box <b>sealing</b> <b>tape</b> (also [...] "Packing Tape"; [...] "Parcel tape", UK) {{is a type}} of {{packaging}} tape which is clear or opaque, and used for closing packages for shipment. It is usually two inch (48 mm) or three inch (72 mm) wide and is made of a polypropylene or polyester backing.|$|R
5000|$|If a tape {{remains on}} {{corrugated}} box during recycling, a tape should be chosen {{which does not}} hinder box recyclability. [...] For example, when taped corrugated boxes are recycled, film backed box <b>sealing</b> <b>tapes</b> do not hinder box recycling: the PSA adhesive stays with the backing and is easily removed.|$|R
5000|$|Thread <b>seal</b> <b>tape</b> (also {{known as}} PTFE tape or plumber's tape) is a {{polytetrafluoroethylene}} (PTFE) film {{for use in}} sealing pipe threads. The tape is sold cut to specific widths and wound on a spool, {{making it easy to}} wind around pipe threads. It is also known by the genericised trade-name Teflon tape; while Teflon is in fact identical to PTFE, Chemours (the trade-mark holders) consider this usage incorrect, especially as they no longer manufacture Teflon in tape form. Thread <b>seal</b> <b>tape</b> lubricates allowing for a deeper seating of the threads, and it helps prevent the threads from seizing when being unscrewed. The tape also works as a deformable filler and thread lubricant, helping to seal the joint without hardening or making it more difficult to tighten, and instead making it easier to tighten.|$|E
5000|$|The taper on NPT threads {{allows them}} to form a seal when torqued as the flanks of the threads {{compress}} against each other, as opposed to parallel/straight thread fittings or compression fittings in which the threads merely hold the pieces together and do not provide the seal. The various types of pipe threads are designed for use both with or without thread sealants, as particular applications demand. The sealants, where used, are typically thread <b>seal</b> <b>tape</b> or pipe dope (sometimes plumber's putty). As the thread body is tapered (...) , a larger diameter keeps compressing into a smaller diameter and finally forms a seal (no clearance remains between the crests and roots of the threads because of the taper). This means that NPT fittings should be burr-free and lubricated using a lubricant like lubricating paste or thread <b>seal</b> <b>tape.</b> The use of tape also helps to limit corrosion on the threads, which otherwise can make future disassembly nearly impossible.|$|E
50|$|A {{threaded}} pipe has a screw thread at {{one or both}} ends for assembly. Steel pipe is often joined with threaded connections; tapered threads are cut into {{the end of the}} pipe, sealant is applied in the form of thread-sealing compound or thread <b>seal</b> <b>tape</b> (also known as PTFE or Teflon tape) and the pipe is threaded into a threaded fitting with a pipe wrench.|$|E

40|$|The {{first part}} of this work deals with the {{characterization}} of 12 commercially available <b>sealing</b> <b>tapes</b> for microtiter plates with regard to their oxygen and water vapor permeability. Special attention was given to the influence of the evaporation on the liquid temperature in the well. The results of the experimental analysis showed that three of the investigated <b>sealing</b> <b>tapes</b> do not permit oxygen transport and are therefore unsuitable for aerobic cultivation. With respect to water vapor permeability, the remaining <b>sealing</b> <b>tapes</b> exhibit vast differences. On average, the water loss was 40 % of the initial volume after 24 hours at 37 °C and 45 % humidity. This immense liquid loss led to differences of up to 3. 8 °C from to the desired temperature due to evaporative cooling. Accordingly, none of the 12 <b>sealing</b> <b>tapes</b> met the requirements of the user. To address this optimization potential, a mathematical model was developed. With the help of the model, it was shown that, contrary to oxygen supply, the evaporation rate is linearly dependent {{on the size of the}} diffusion area. A reduction of the diffusion area can therefore reduce evaporation without affecting oxygen transport. The second part focused on the development of a measurement technique for the quantitative, non-invasive detection of viscosity in shake flasks. The measurement technique is based on detecting the position of the rotating bulk liquid as it changes with respect to the direction of centrifugal acceleration dependent on the viscosity. It is possible to correlate this offset in the liquid motion with the viscosity. For non-invasive detection of the liquid position, a fluorescence as well as a transmission measurement were developed. To convert the information about the liquid’s position in the shake flask into a viscosity signal, a calibration was established using model fluids of known viscosity. The developed 8 -flask-device was validated by the cultivation of the bacteria Paenibacillus polymyxa and Xanthomonas campestris. The comparison of the online measurement technique with a conventional measurement on a rheometer showed that the viscosity can be measured with an accuracy of 3. 11 mPa·s ± 0. 6 mPa·s up to 120 mPa·s...|$|R
50|$|Petroleum-based {{pipe dope}} is not {{intended}} for use on threaded PVC, CPVC or ABS pipe and fittings since it will deteriorate the plastic. Builders in the US are expected to use thread compounds that meet ASTM F2331 - Standard Test Method for Determining Chemical Compatibility of Thread Sealants with Thermoplastic Threaded Pipe and Fittings Materials or thread <b>seal</b> <b>tape</b> on PVC, CPVC and ABS threads.|$|E
50|$|Thread {{sealants}} such as {{joint compound}} (pipe dope or thread <b>seal</b> <b>tape</b> such as PTFE tape) are unnecessary on compression fitting threads, {{as it is}} not the thread that seals the joint but rather the compression of the ferrule between the nut and pipe. However, a small amount of plumber's grease or light oil applied to the threads will provide lubrication to help ensure a smooth, consistent tightening of the compression nut.|$|E
50|$|Thread <b>seal</b> <b>tape</b> used in {{plumbing}} applications is {{most commonly}} white, {{but it is}} also available in various colors. It is often used to correspond to color coded pipelines (US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand: yellow for natural gas, green for oxygen, etc.). These color-codes for thread sealing tape were introduced by Bill Bentley of Unasco Pty Ltd in the 1970s. In the UK, tape is used from coloured reels, e.g. yellow reels for gas, green for potable water.|$|E
50|$|Reuse or {{recycling}} {{are sometimes}} {{aided by a}} tape being removable from a surface. If a tape remains on an item during recycling, a tape should be chosen which does not hinder the recyclability of the item. For example, when taped corrugated boxes are recycled, film backed box <b>sealing</b> <b>tapes</b> do not hinder box recycling: the PSA adhesive stays with the backing and is easily removed.|$|R
50|$|ASTM International has {{dozens of}} {{standards}} related to pressure-sensitive tape. Some {{of them are}} for general types of PSA tape: Others are for specific types. For example, ASTM D1000 has test methods for electrical tapes. There are ASTM specifications for many tapes including: D2301 for vinyl electrical tape, D5486 for box <b>sealing</b> <b>tape,</b> etc. Several of the ASTM test methods are coordinated with PSTC, other trade associations, and other international organizations.|$|R
5000|$|With semi {{automated}} equipment, {{the operator}} typically fills and loads a {{box at the}} entrance to the case sealer; the box may or may not have the bottom flaps previously closed. The operator closes the top flaps and feeds the box in or through a machine which automatically applies the closure. This helps save time and controls the application of the closure materials such as box <b>sealing</b> <b>tape</b> ...|$|R
50|$|The {{threaded}} pipes {{used in some}} plumbing installations for {{the delivery}} of fluids under pressure have a threaded section that is slightly conical. Examples are the NPT and BSP series. The seal provided by a threaded pipe joint is created when a tapered externally threaded end is tightened into an end with internal threads. Normally a good seal requires {{the application of a}} separate sealant in the joint, such as thread <b>seal</b> <b>tape,</b> or a liquid or paste pipe sealant such as pipe dope, however some threaded pipe joints do not require a separate sealant.|$|E
50|$|The {{threaded}} pipes {{used in some}} plumbing installations for {{the delivery}} of gases or liquids under pressure have a tapered thread that is slightly conical (in contrast to the parallel sided cylindrical section commonly found on bolts and leadscrews). The seal provided by a threaded pipe joint depends upon multiple factors: the labyrinth seal created by the threads; a positive seal between the threads created by thread deformation when they are tightened to the proper torque; and sometimes {{on the presence of}} a sealing coating, such as thread <b>seal</b> <b>tape</b> or a liquid or paste pipe sealant such as pipe dope. Tapered thread joints typically do not include a gasket.|$|E
50|$|Steel pipe is {{sometimes}} joined using threaded connections, where tapered threads (see National Pipe Thread) are {{cut into the}} end of the tubing segment, sealant is applied in the form of thread sealing compound or thread <b>seal</b> <b>tape</b> (also known as PTFE or Teflon tape), and it is then threaded into a corresponding threaded fitting using two pipe wrenches. Beyond domestic or light commercial settings, steel pipe is often joined by welding, or by use of mechanical couplings made by companies such as Victaulic or Anvil International (formerly Grinnell) that hold the pipe joint together via a groove pressed or cut (a rarely used older practice), into the ends of the pipes.|$|E
50|$|In March 2011, Canadian Public Safety Minister Vic Toews {{wrote to}} U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, asserting that Canada {{would need to}} review the <b>sealed</b> <b>tape</b> of Welner’s {{interview}} in order to consider repatriating Khadr. After reviewing the interviews, Canada repatriated Khadr on September 29, 2012 under heavy pressure from the United States government. However, Canada echoed Welner’s previously stated concerns {{about the nature of}} Khadr’s dangerousness and placed him in a maximum security facility. In October 2013, Khadr’s prison transfer application, considered independently of Welner’s involvement, was denied.|$|R
5000|$|Lesser {{protection}} (level C in the US) suits may be coveralls of treated material, or multi-piece combinations, <b>sealed</b> with <b>tape.</b> This kind {{of protection}} is still [...] "proof" [...] against many non-invasive substances, such as anthrax.|$|R
40|$|All samples {{should be}} {{considered}} potentially infectious. All specimens should be collected in a primary container that is watertight and leak-proof and must be securely <b>sealed</b> (<b>tape</b> around the cap will ensure that the containers do not open during transit). If immediate transport is not possible, samples should be stored frozen at- 20 o C or below. The primary container should {{be put in a}} secondary container such as zip-lock plastic bag with an insulating material between primary and secondary containers. The secondary container should be put into a rigid outer packaging box during transport. Please ensure maintenance of cold chain (2 - 8 °C) while the sample is being transported...|$|R
