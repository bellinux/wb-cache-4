5|$|A cricothyrotomy is an {{incision}} {{made through}} the skin and cricothyroid membrane to establish a patent airway during certain life-threatening situations, such as airway obstruction by a foreign body, angioedema, or massive facial trauma. A cricothyrotomy is nearly always performed {{as a last resort}} in cases where orotracheal and nasotracheal intubation are impossible or contraindicated. Cricothyrotomy is easier and quicker to perform than tracheotomy, does not require manipulation of the cervical <b>spine</b> <b>and</b> is associated with fewer complications.|$|E
5|$|As the {{structure}} of the back is complex and the reporting of pain is subjective and affected by social factors, the diagnosis of low back pain is not straightforward. While most low back pain is caused by muscle and joint problems, this cause must be separated from neurological problems, spinal tumors, fracture of the <b>spine,</b> <b>and</b> infections, among others.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} thorns <b>and</b> <b>spines</b> on the feeding of 5 herbivore species in arid Australia. The herbivores were the rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), euro kangaroo (Macropus robustus), red kangaroo (Macropus rufus), sheep (Ovis aries), and cattle (Bos taurus). Five woody plants without <b>spines</b> or thorns <b>and</b> 6 woody plants with thorns {{were included in the}} study. The <b>spines</b> <b>and</b> thorns were not found to affect the herbivores' rates of feeding (items ingested/min), but they did reduce the herbivores' rates of biomass ingestion (g-dry/item). The reduction in biomass ingested occurred in two ways: at a given diameter, twigs with <b>spines</b> <b>and</b> thorns had less mass than undefended plants, and the herbivores consumed twigs with smaller diameters on plants with <b>spines</b> <b>and</b> thorns. The relative importance of the two ways that twigs with <b>spines</b> <b>and</b> thorns provided less biomass varied with herbivore body mass. Reduced twig mass was more important for small herbivores, while large herbivores selected smaller diameters. The effectiveness of <b>spines</b> <b>and</b> thorns as anti-herbivore defenses did not vary with the evolutionary history of the herbivores (i. e. native vs. introduced). <b>Spines</b> <b>and</b> thorns mainly affected the herbivores' selection of maximum twig sizes (reducing diameter and mass), but the minimum twig sizes selected were also reduced...|$|R
5|$|Fish steaks are cut {{perpendicular}} to the <b>spine</b> <b>and</b> include bones. Although their delicate flesh requires quicker cooking than beef, steaks from swordfish, halibut, tuna, salmon and mahi-mahi can be grilled. They are frequently cooked whole or as fillets. Fish steaks may also be poached or baked using a court bouillon, wine or sauce or cooked en papillote.|$|E
5|$|On 12 September, the University of Leicester team {{announced}} that the human remains were a possible candidate for Richard's body, but emphasised the need for caution. The positive indicators were that the body was of an adult male; it was buried beneath the choir of the church; it had severe scoliosis of the spine possibly making one shoulder higher than the other. An object {{that appeared to be}} an arrowhead was found under the <b>spine</b> <b>and</b> the skull had severe injuries.|$|E
5|$|The {{publisher}} was Galaxy Publishing Corporation, New York. The {{magazine was}} initially titled Beyond Fantasy Fiction, and this remained the title on the masthead throughout the ten-issue run. However, issue 9 changed the title to simply Beyond Fiction {{on the cover}}, <b>spine,</b> <b>and</b> table of contents. Issue 10 used the new, shorter title on the cover and spine, but reverted to Beyond Fantasy Fiction for the table of contents. As a result, the magazine is often listed as having changed its name {{for the last two}} issues.|$|E
50|$|The {{dorsal fin}} has twelve <b>spines</b> <b>and</b> 13-15 soft rays. The anal fin has two <b>spines</b> <b>and</b> 15-17 soft rays. The {{pectoral}} fin usually has 13 soft rays but can occasionally have 14. The tail (caudal) fin possesses 14 rays.|$|R
50|$|Acromyrmex can be {{identified}} from the closely related Atta genus of leafcutter ants by their having four pairs of <b>spines</b> <b>and</b> a rough exoskeleton on the upper surface of the thorax compared to three pairs of <b>spines</b> <b>and</b> a smooth exoskeleton in Atta.|$|R
50|$|The palometa is best {{recognized}} by its elongated dorsal and anal fins with dark anterior lobes. The dorsal fin usually has {{seven or eight}} <b>spines</b> <b>and</b> 19-20 soft rays, while the anal fin has two or three <b>spines</b> <b>and</b> 16-18 soft rays.|$|R

5|$|White tigers {{are more}} {{frequently}} bred in captivity, where the comparatively small gene pool {{can lead to}} inbreeding. This has given white tigers a greater likelihood of being born with physical defects, such as cleft palate, scoliosis (curvature of the <b>spine),</b> <b>and</b> strabismus (squint). Even apparently healthy white tigers generally do not live {{as long as their}} orange counterparts. Attempts have been made to cross white and orange tigers to remedy this, often mixing with other subspecies in the process.|$|E
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid envelops {{the brain}} and the <b>spine,</b> <b>and</b> lumbar {{puncture}} or spinal tap is the removal of {{a small amount of}} fluid using a needle inserted between the lumbar vertebrae. Characteristic findings in Guillain–Barré syndrome are an elevated protein level, usually greater than 0.55g/L, and fewer than 10 white blood cells per cubic millimeter of fluid ("albuminocytological dissociation"). This combination distinguishes Guillain–Barré syndrome from other conditions (such as lymphoma and poliomyelitis) in which both the protein and the cell count are elevated. Elevated CSF protein levels are found in approximately 50% of patients in the first 3 days after onset of weakness, which increases to 80% after the first week.|$|E
50|$|Penetrating {{injuries}} {{can introduce}} pathogenic microorganisms into the wound. Examples include Clostridium tetani and Staphylococcus aureus (from <b>spines</b> <b>and</b> thorns), Sporothrix schenckii (from rose thorns, grasses, and sphagnum moss), Mycobacterium kansasii (from blackberries), Mycobacterium marinum (from cactus <b>spines),</b> <b>and</b> Mycobacterium ulcerans (from spiky tropical vegetation).|$|R
50|$|Adults of {{this species}} can grow up to 6 cm TL. This fish is white in {{colouration}} with a yellow caudal fin. Its dorsal fin has 12 <b>spines</b> <b>and</b> 14 to 15 soft rays. Its anal fin has 2 <b>spines</b> <b>and</b> 11 to 12 soft rays.|$|R
50|$|The {{caudal fin}} is {{typically}} rounded or {{square in the}} mud darter. Its dorsal fin has two lobes, the first with 10-12 <b>spines</b> <b>and</b> the second with 10-14 rays.

5|$|Generally nocturnal, {{the round}} ribbontail ray can be solitary or gregarious, {{and is an}} active {{predator}} of small, benthic molluscs, crustaceans, and bony fishes. It is aplacental viviparous, with the embryos sustained by yolk, and later histotroph ("uterine milk") secreted by the mother; up to seven pups are born at a time. Although not aggressive, if provoked the round ribbontail ray will defend itself with its venomous tail <b>spine,</b> <b>and</b> it {{has been responsible for}} at least one fatality. It is valued by ecotourist divers and recreational anglers. This slow-reproducing species is threatened by commercial fishing, both targeted and as bycatch, and habitat degradation across much of its range. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|In graph theory, a book {{embedding}} is a {{generalization of}} planar embedding of a graph to embeddings into a book, {{a collection of}} half-planes all having the same line as their boundary. Usually, the vertices of the graph are required to lie on this boundary line, called the <b>spine,</b> <b>and</b> the edges are required to stay within a single half-plane. The book thickness of a graph is the smallest possible number of half-planes for any book embedding of the graph. Book thickness is also called pagenumber, stacknumber or fixed outerthickness. Book embeddings have also been used to define several other graph invariants including the pagewidth and book crossing number.|$|E
5|$|The medical {{problems}} of the ancient Egyptians stemmed directly from their environment. Living and working close to the Nile brought hazards from malaria and debilitating schistosomiasis parasites, which caused liver and intestinal damage. Dangerous wildlife such as crocodiles and hippos were also a common threat. The lifelong labors of farming and building put stress on the <b>spine</b> <b>and</b> joints, and traumatic injuries from construction and warfare all took a significant toll on the body. The grit and sand from stone-ground flour abraded teeth, leaving them susceptible to abscesses (though caries were rare).|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} believed {{that only the}} actin cytoskeleton resides in dendritic <b>spines</b> <b>and</b> controls <b>spine</b> morphology <b>and</b> plasticity. Here, we report that microtubules (MTs) are present in <b>spines</b> <b>and</b> that shRNA knockdown of the MT plus-end-binding protein EB 3 significantly reduces spine formation. Furthermore, stabilization and inhibition of MTs by low doses of taxol and nocodazole enhance <b>and</b> impair <b>spine</b> formation elicited by BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), respectively. Therefore, MTs {{play an important role}} in the control and regulation of dendritic <b>spine</b> development <b>and</b> plasticity.

5|$|The multifidus muscles run up {{and down}} along the back of the <b>spine,</b> <b>and</b> are {{important}} for keeping the spine straight and stable during many common movements such as sitting, walking and lifting. A problem with these muscles is often found in someone with chronic low back pain, because the back pain causes the person to use the back muscles improperly in trying to avoid the pain. The problem with the multifidus muscles continues even after the pain goes away, and is probably an important reason why the pain comes back. Teaching people with chronic low back pain how to use these muscles is recommended as part of a recovery program.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} and biological mechanism of LTP {{is still not}} understood, but some successful models have been developed. Studies of dendritic spines, protruding structures on dendrites that physically grow and retract {{over the course of}} minutes or hours, have suggested a relationship between the electrical resistance of the <b>spine</b> <b>and</b> the effective synapse strength, due to their relationship with intracellular calcium transients. Mathematical models such as BCM Theory, which depends also on intracellular calcium in relation to NMDA receptor voltage gates, have been developed since the 1980s and modify the traditional a priori Hebbian learning model with both biological and experimental justification. Still others have proposed re-arranging or synchronizing the relationship between receptor regulation, LTP, and synaptic strength.|$|E
5|$|The {{skin of a}} larva is mottled with black, brown, {{and yellow}} pigmentation. Skin color changes as the larvae develop and pigment cells migrate and {{concentrate}} in {{different regions of the}} body. The pigment cells, called chromatophores, are derived from the neural crest. The three types of pigment chromatophores in salamanders include yellow xanthophores, black melanophores, and silvery iridiophores (or guanophores). As the larvae mature, the melanophores concentrate along the body and provide the darker background. The yellow xanthophores arrange along the <b>spine</b> <b>and</b> on top of the limbs. The rest of the body is flecked with reflective iridiophores along the sides and underneath.|$|E

5|$|Two major {{innovations}} that revolutionised {{the effectiveness of}} mounted warriors in battle were the saddle and the stirrup. Riders quickly learned to pad their horse's backs {{to protect themselves from}} the horse's <b>spine</b> <b>and</b> withers, and fought on horseback for centuries with little more than a blanket or pad on the horse's back and a rudimentary bridle. To help distribute the rider's weight and protect the horse's back, some cultures created stuffed padding that resembles the panels of today's English saddle. Both the Scythians and Assyrians used pads with added felt attached with a surcingle or girth around the horse's barrel for increased security and comfort. Xenophon mentioned the use of a padded cloth on cavalry mounts as early as the 4th century BC.|$|E
5|$|Among sharks, the porbeagle's {{capacity}} for elevating body temperature {{is second only}} to the salmon shark's. Its red muscles are located deep within the body, adjacent to the <b>spine,</b> <b>and</b> its lateral rete is composed of over 4,000 small arteries arranged in bands. It {{has one of the highest}} core temperatures within its family, 8–10°C (14–18°F) warmer than that of the surrounding water. Being warm-bodied may allow this shark to maintain higher cruising speeds, hunt in deep water for extended periods of time, and/or enter higher latitudes during winter to exploit food resources not available to other sharks. The orbital retia of the porbeagle can raise the temperature of its brain and eyes by 3–6°C (5–11°F), and likely serve to buffer those sensitive organs against the large temperature shifts that accompany changes in depth; potential benefits of this include increased visual acuity and reduced response times.|$|E
5|$|Enaliarctos, {{a fossil}} species of late Oligocene/early Miocene (24–22 mya) California, closely resembled modern pinnipeds; it was adapted to an aquatic {{life with a}} {{flexible}} <b>spine,</b> <b>and</b> limbs modified into flippers. Its teeth were adapted for shearing (like terrestrial carnivorans), {{and it may have}} stayed near shore more often than its extant relatives. Enaliarctos was capable of swimming with both the fore-flippers and hind-flippers, but it may have been more specialized as a fore-flipper swimmer. One species, Enaliarctos emlongi, exhibited notable sexual dimorphism, suggesting that this physical characteristic may have been an important driver of pinniped evolution. A closer relative of extant pinnipeds was Pteronarctos, which lived in Oregon 19–15 mya. As in modern seals, Pteroarctos had an orbital wall that was not limited by certain facial bones (like the jugal or lacrimal bone), but was mostly shaped by the maxilla.|$|E
