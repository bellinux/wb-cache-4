40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} resource allocation in a multiple access channel. Our objective is to obtain rate and power allocation policies that maximize a general concave utility function of average transmission rates over the information theoretic capacity region of the multiple-access channel. We consider several different scenarios. First, we address the utility maximization problem in a non-fading channel and present an iterative gradient projection algorithm that uses approximate projection. By exploiting the polymatroid structure of the capacity region, we show that the approximate projection can be implemented in time polynomial {{in the number of}} users. Second, we consider resource allocation in a fading channel. Optimal rate and power allocation policies are presented for the case that power control is possible and channel statistics are available. For the case where transmission power is fixed and channel statistics are unknown, we propose a greedy rate allocation policy and provide bounds on the performance difference of this policy and the optimal policy in terms of channel variations and structure of the utility function. This policy does not require queue-length information. Moreover, we present numerical results that demonstrate superior convergence rate performance for the greedy policy compared to queue-length based policies. In order to reduce the computational complexity of the greedy policy, we present approximate rate allocation policies which track the greedy policy within a certain neighborhood that is characterized in terms of the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>fading.</b> by Ali ParandehGheibi.

40|$|Abstract: The {{prediction}} <b>of</b> rain <b>fade</b> slope on {{satellite link}} is currently an essential parameter used by system designers {{for the development}} of communication power control and error-correction schemes, which mini-mize effects of the link outages for their systems. It is also useful for the implementation of computer generated received signal for primary experiments. Due to its time variation and dependence on the rain type and characteristics, it will be useful to develop an efficient model that fits the fade slope evaluated from the link. Fade slope indicates the rate of change of rain attenuation. The knowledge <b>of</b> <b>fade</b> slope <b>of</b> attenuation caused by rain or other meteorological events are very important for fade mitigation techniques. Knowledge of this parameter is important for determining the required tracking <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>fade</b> mitigation techniques. The fade slope depends on attenuation level, on sampling time and on climatic parameters (drop size distribution and therefore on the type of rain). I...|$|R

Such a system considers both the amplitude and the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fading</b> envelope which jointly represent the Markov state.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{performance}} of hybrid-ARQ (automatic repeat request) in Rayleigh blockfading channels in a setting where rate is increased with the average SNR such that a constant outage probability is maintained. H-ARQ allows for early termination of transmission once the receiver is able to successfully decode, and thus provides an advantage over systems without H-ARQ. It is shown that H-ARQ allows the average transmission rate to very quickly approach the ergodic capacity <b>of</b> the <b>fading</b> channel as the maximum number <b>of</b> <b>fading</b> blocks per codeword (which {{is proportional to the}} <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> temporal <b>fading)</b> increases, whereas this convergence is much slower without H-ARQ. Furthermore, although H-ARQ does not provide an advantage in terms of well-known high-SNR metrics (multiplexing gain and high-SNR offset), it is seen to provide a significant advantage throughout the range of practically relevant SNR’s. In addition, incremental redundancy is shown to outperform lower-complexity Chase combining, particularly at moderate and high SNR’s. I...|$|R

In the following, level crossing rates of received signal amplitude, combined with recent on-line change detection techniques [3] are used to estimate fading bandwidth.

40|$|In {{wireless}} transmissions {{the communication}} is often degraded by random fades, noise and other performance reducing phenomena. One way {{of improving the}} stability and reducing the error rates is to use relaying techniques where several nodes cooperate in a transmission between two of them. This thesis analyzes some of the available Decode-and-Forward relaying schemes for wireless transmission. The investigated schemes are conventional repetition coding, partial repetition coding and non-collaborative direct transmission. I have developed a three-node communication system using an audio channel to test the performance of repetition coding and direct transmission. This audio communication system {{can also be used}} to demonstrate some basic phenomena in wireless transmissions and how different scenarios change the performance of the communication. A theoretical performance analysis and computer simulations of the schemes performance over a Rayleigh fading channel are done as a basis for comparison. As a result we see that in the audio communication system repetition coding actually degrades the performance, compared to direct transmission, when using a relatively slow data rate in comparison to the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fading</b> in the audio channel...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a two-hop wireless network where a transmitter communicates with a receiver via $M$ relays with an amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol. Recent works {{have shown that}} sophisticated linear processing such as beamforming and distributed space-time coding (DSTC) at relays enables to improve the AF performance. However, the relative utility of these strategies depend on the available channel state information at transmitter (CSIT), which in turn depends on system parameters such as the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> the underlying <b>fading</b> channel and that of training and feedback procedures. Moreover, it is of practical interest to have a single transmit scheme that handles different CSIT scenarios. This motivates us to {{consider a}} unified approach based on DSTC that potentially provides diversity gain with statistical CSIT and exploits some additional side information if available. Under individual power constraints at the relays, we optimize the amplifier power allocation such that pairwise error probability conditioned on the available CSIT is minimized. Under perfect CSIT we propose an on-off gradient algorithm that efficiently finds a set of relays to switch on. Under partial and statistical CSIT, we propose a simple waterfilling algorithm that yields a non-trivial solution between maximum power allocation and a generalized STC that equalizes the averaged amplified noise for all relays. Moreover, we derive closed-form solutions for M= 2 and in certain asymptotic regimes that enable an easy interpretation of the proposed algorithms. It is found that an appropriate amplifier power allocation is mandatory for DSTC to offer sufficient diversity and power gain in a general network topology.
