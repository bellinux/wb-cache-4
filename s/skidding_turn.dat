5000|$|Unlike a <b>skidding</b> <b>turn,</b> which {{primarily}} {{uses the}} skidding effect {{to reduce speed}} (hence the [...] "Z"-path), a (perfect) carve turn does not lose any speed {{because there is no}} braking action in the turns. Rather, the reduction of the average path slope angle resulting from the carve skier's S-shaped path down the slope, as opposed to a path straight down, reduces the skier's speed. The carve skier wishing to go slower must wait a little longer before initiating the next C-turn, making the [...] "C" [...] longer. This will lead the skier to ski more across the slope (in extremes uphill), reducing the average path slope angle.|$|E
40|$|Generating {{skilled and}} well-planned {{behaviours}} for autonomous agents is a chal-lenging problem common to both computer animation and robotics. This thesis presents {{a system that}} uses motion graphs for online motion planning, result-ing in skilled driving behaviours for a dynamic model of a car in a constrained environment. The result reproduces skilled driving behaviors. It is a partic-ular challenge to get the cars to produce skidding-into-turn behaviors when approaching sharp corners, which can achieve the fastest speeds around a track. The techniques explored in this thesis are potentially generalizable to other dynamic vehicle behaviours, in computer games or simulations. We demonstrate that a well-formed move tree or motion graph, created from the output of a physics-based simulation {{can be used to}} produce realistic steering behaviours on a variety of tracks. We show that a finite-horizon A* search algorithm is well suited to this task. We have produced a number of smooth animations that demonstrate considerable anticipation and agility, be it through acceleration/deceleration around tricky obstacles, or a hard <b>skidding</b> <b>turn</b> into a corner after approaching at high speed. Finally, we offer a number of ways that we could speed up the algorithms for future work in this area. i...|$|E

Aeromech Engineering’s NXT UAV is a high speed target drone that is intended to simulate a small aircraft threat. However, {{in the interest of}} increasing functionality, enabling NXT to accomplish wings level <b>skidding</b> <b>turns</b> provides the basis for a UAV that can simulate a threat from a missile.

The model was further improved by developing a six degree of freedom simulation. A controller using four loop closures and utilizing both rudder and aileron for control was developed. Any outside guidance system that navigates using a heading command can easily be integrated into this controller design. Simulations show this controller enables the NXT UAV to accomplish up to 3 G wings level <b>skidding</b> <b>turns.</b> Further testing, showed that the controller was able to tolerate significant turbulence, sensor noise, loop failures and changes within the plant dynamics.

The orientation measurement system {{that consists of}} inertial and magnetic field sensor measures angular velocity, acceleration and magnetic field, {{on the other hand}} the gliding trajectory measurement system that consists of the GPS receiver measures latitude, longitude and altitude. The 3 D orientation of skier's body segments and the 3 D gliding trajectory on skiing turn are estimated using sensor fusion and the information measured by the orientation measurement systems and the gliding trajectory measurement system attached to skier. The 3 D gliding velocity on skiing turn is estimated with the 3 D gliding trajectory. The measurement experiment has been conducted by the skier attached the measurement systems on an actual snow field. The joint angle has indicated the gliding form in skidding and carving turn, the gliding trajectory has visualized clearly the difference in moving distance between <b>skidding</b> <b>turn</b> and carving turn. Furthermore, the gliding velocity relative to skier's coordinate has perceived the different period and the effect of side skidding on these two turns. The experimental results have indicated quantitatively the ever-changing state of skier. The major features of skiing turn can be analyzed by the proposed method, which can use as an effective method for suggesting more ideal turning form, the skill rating, the prevention of disorder and injury from skiing...|$|E
40|$|Increasing productivity, {{reducing}} cost, reducing soil damage, {{reducing the}} impact of harvesting on standing tree and regeneration are all very important objectives in ground skidding system {{in the management of}} the Hyrcanian forest. The research carried out to obtain these objectives included four logging methods, tree length method (TLM), long length method (LLM), short length method (SLM), and wood extraction by mule (mule) in northern Iran. In order to determine the cost per unit, time study techniques were used for each harvesting method, time study data are shifted to logarithmic data based on 10. On the basis of the developed models simulated, 11 skidding turns are simulated and the unit cost are estimated depending on the diameter of the log (DL), skidding distance (SD), and the winching distance (WD) for 11 different cycles with TLM, LLM and SLM. The results showed that on average, the net costs per extraction of one cubic meter of wood were 3. 06, 5. 69, 6. 81 and 34. 36 €/m 3 in TLM, LLM, SLM and mule. The costs depending on diameter of log (DL), skidding distance (SD) and winching distance (WD) showed that the most economical alternative for Northern Iran is TLM. In the cut-to-length system, the costs of both alternatives LLM, SLM were significantly dependent on DL., thus the result of this study suggests {{that as long as the}} diameter of the felled trees is less than 40 cm, the cut-to-length system is not an economical alternative, whilst the cut-to-length method can be applied for trees with a diameter more than 40 cm. Where diameters are more than 40 cm TLM it is more economical than SLM, however it was not significantly different. Depending on SD in short skidding distance SLM is preferable to LLM but in cases of long skidding distance LLM is more economical than SLM. The winching distance affect was not a factor on cost. To assess the damage on seedlings and standing trees a 100 % inventory method was employed in pre-hauling and post-hauling, alongside of skidding trails, winching strips and mule hauling with a 12 m width. To chose the best alternative depending on standing damage the Analysis of multiple criterial approval (MA) was applied. The amount of trees damaged by winching operation were 11. 89 % in TLM, 14. 44 % in LLM 27. 59 %, SLM and 0 stem and by skidding operation were 16. 73 %, 3. 13 % and 8. 78 % of total trees in TLM, LLM and SLM. In the winching area about 14 %, 20 %, 21 % and 6 % of the total regeneration was damaged by TLM, LLM, SLM and mule and the skidding operation damaged 7. 5 % in TLM, 7. 4 % LLM and 9. 4 % in SLM. The friendliest alternative to residual standing was mule but in manual method (where the wood extraction is done by skidder) MA showed that the best alternative depending on residual damage is LLM. To determine the degree of soil compaction a core sampling technique of bulk density was used. Soil samples collected from the horizontal face of a soil pit at 10 cm depth soil core, at 50 m intervals on skid trials, in winching strips and control are (no vehicles pass) a soil sample was taken at 10 m intervals in the hauling direction of the mule. In order to determine the post-harvesting extent of disturbance on skidding trails by skidding operations, the disturbed widths were measured at 50 m intervals along the skid trails. In the winching area, where the winched logs created a streak of displaced soil, the width of the displaced streak was measured at 5 m interval along the winching strip. In mule hauling operations the width of a streak created by a mule foot track was measured at 10 m intervals. To compare increased average bulk density between alternatives one way The ANOVA, Duncan test and Dunnett t-test with a 95 % confidence level were used. A General linear model was applied to relate the increasing bulk density and the slope gradient. To realize the correlation between the increment of soil bulk density and the slope gradient and the correlation between the soil compaction and soil moisture content (%) The Pearson correlation test was applied. To choose the best alternative (in manual method) a MA test was applied again. The bulk density on the skidding trail increased 51 % for 30 <b>skidding</b> <b>turn,</b> 35 % for 31 <b>skidding</b> <b>turn</b> (one unloaded and one loaded pass) and 46 % for 41 <b>skidding</b> <b>turn.</b> Results of ANOVA (p < 0. 05) show significant differences of bulk density between alternatives. Duncan test and the Dunnett t-test indicated that the increasing soil bulk density was not significant between control samples and winching strip of TLM and extraction by mule samples. The general linear modeling and Pearson correlation test results indicated that the slope gradient had an insignificant effect on soil compaction, whilst the Pearson test indicates a medium negative correlation between soil compaction and percentage of soil moisture. By ground-based winching operation 0. 07 %, 0. 03 %, 0. 05 % and 0. 002 % of the total area and by ground based skidding operation 1. 21 %, 1. 67 %, 0. 81 % and 0. 00 % of total area was disturbed and compacted in TLM, LLM, SLM and mule. The Pearson correlation results show that the width of disturbed area was significantly influenced by the diameter of logs and length of logs (p ˂ 0. 05), but there is no significant correlation between soil disturbance width and slope. The results of analysis of MA showed that soil compaction was not related to logging method but sensitivity analysis of MA shows that LLM and TLM are both preferable to SLM...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} the motion {{analysis}} of skier gliding on the actual snow field using inertial sensors. It is difficult to measure the motion of skier gliding on the actual snow field since the gliding velocity is fast and the measurement area is large. Therefore, few studies have analyzed ski turns in gliding on the actual snow field. It is necessary to analyze the skier gliding on the actual snow field in resolving the mechanism of ski turns. In our previous study, we developed the motion measurement method of skier using inertial and magnetic field sensors. The 3 D posture is estimated by applying the sensor fusion method, and the method can estimate the 3 D posture compensating the drift error of gyro sensor and reducing the effect of dynamic acceleration of accelerometer. Furthermore, we developed the sensor fusion method estimating the 3 D posture in local coordinate by the information of inertial sensors attaching the body segments. The joint angle of skier in gliding on the actual snow field can be estimated by this method and inverse kinematics. We conducted the measurement experiment by skier gliding on the actual snow field. The inertial sensors and the GPS receiver were attached to the body segments {{and the top of}} skier, respectively. Skier conducted carving and <b>skidding</b> <b>turns</b> in this experiment. We calculated the joint angles of skier by the information of inertial sensors, and the switchovers of turns are estimated by the GPS receiver output.

50|$|One common {{scenario}} {{that can lead}} to an unintentional spin is a <b>skidding</b> uncoordinated <b>turn</b> toward the runway during the landing sequence. A pilot who is overshooting the turn to final approach may be tempted to apply more rudder to increase the rate of turn. The result is twofold: the nose of the airplane drops below the horizon and the bank angle increases due to rudder roll. Reacting to these unintended changes, the pilot then begins to pull the elevator control aft (thus increasing the angle of attack and load factor) while applying opposite aileron to decrease bank angle. Taken to its extreme, this can result in an uncoordinated turn with sufficient angle of attack to cause the aircraft to stall. This is called a cross-control stall, and is very dangerous if it happens at low altitude where the pilot has little time to recover. In order to avoid this scenario, pilots are taught the importance of always making coordinated turns. They may simply choose to make the final turn earlier and shallower to prevent an overshoot of the runway center line and provide a larger margin of safety. Certificated, light, single-engine airplanes must meet specific criteria regarding stall and spin behavior. Spins are often entered intentionally for training, flight testing, or aerobatics.|$|R
