40|$|Bachelor {{thesis is}} focused on current issues in the pension and <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> of the self-employed, where {{fundamental}} changes occurred from 2009 onwards regarding not only collection of premiums but also the benefits provided by these systems. The system of insurance for self-employed persons underwent a long development period, every stage {{from the very beginning}} of insurance through interdependence of pension and <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> to their complete separation affected the current behaviour of the self-employed in this field. Premiums should be understood also in terms of coverage of social incidents, which is an illness, injury, disability or old age. The amount of benefits provided from the system depends on the amount of premiums paid and the period of insurance. For this reason, attention in the thesis was paid to the issue of present statutory regulation of premiums, focusing on special-purpose <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums</b> for the self-employed and the subsequent payment of benefits. Also in the field of pension insurance it is necessary to consider whether the premium payers are sufficiently aware of the link between premiums paid and the amount of such benefits, and can responsibly decide on the choice of assessment base, which has an impact on future security in retirement. The objective of this thesis is, based on an analysis of main problems which consist of complexity and comprehensibility of the existing legislation in force for self-employed persons, to suggest changes aimed at simplifying it. The given topic was studied using qualitative research through semi-structured interviews in a relatively narrow circle of self-employed persons with the aim to investigate the status quo, to get a detailed understanding and practical application of the provisions of the Act. Based on the knowledge and experience from practice, questions were prepared, which were answered not only by clients but also by District Social Security Administration Office staff in Strakonice who deal with administration of premiums. Based on evaluation of individual respondents' replies and with regard to the current problems during practical implementation of pension and <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> administration, an opinion was obtained that the existing legislation is complex and confusing for the self-employed. Therefore, measures were suggested, which could be used as tips for possible amendments to legislation in the field of self-employed persons´ <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums...</b>|$|R

We estimate {{the effects of this}} policy change on the duration of sickness absence for employees in the municipal sector. After the change in policy, this group received 10 percentage points additional compensation during day 91 to 360 in a sick leave. The results indicate that durations of at least 91 days increased by 4. 7 days on average. As a consequence, the cost for the national <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> increased by 3. 0 percent.

40|$|The German {{system of}} <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> is a {{reliable}} system {{which has been}} functioning efficiently {{for a number of}} years. For that reason, the main elements of that system have been presented in the paper. The paper is divided into three chapters. In the first one a general characteristics of the social benefits system in Germany is presented. That system has been divided into three sub-systems: social protection (prudence), social compensations and social support. Each of those has been discussed and their main objectives identified. The second chapter is devoted to statutoiy, or state <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> in Germany. That system covers {{the majority of the population}} and therefore it has been given the most attention in the paper. Groups of insured parties covered by that system are presented, different types of patients insurance offices and their financing is discussed, and their relations with other elements of the social security system identified. Types of benefits payable to the insured parties within the scheme of statutory <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> have also been described. The third chapter is devoted to private <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> which covers a significantly smaller proportion of the more wealthy German population. In that chapter the conditions in which a change from statutory insurance schemes to private insurance systems took place are described. Methods by which <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> is calculated and types of benefits payable under private insurance are also presented. The last, fourth chapter, identifies the main issues related to the <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> system in Germany.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the implementation of the waiting period into the <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> in the Czech Republic in the years from 2008 to 2014. The theoretical part explains the fundamental concepts related to the <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance,</b> the health insurance allowance and the waiting period. The practical part consists of a legal analysis and the current happening around the waiting period in the Czech Republic or in the EU and EFTA member states. The income and expenditure analysis of the <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> helps to reveal that the costs of <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> have decreased, which was also due to the implementation of the waiting period. This work evaluates data, which indicate that the short-term morbidity has decreased as well as the work incapacity. There are detailed calculations in the conclusion which show how adjustments in the <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> changed the amount of wage compensation and the sick benefits.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the analysis and evaluation {{of the impact of}} changes that occurred in the system of <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> in the Czech Republic between 2010 and 2017. During this period there were several legislative adjustments to the <b>Sickness</b> <b>Insurance</b> Act, especially the austerity measures adopted in 2010 and the adjustments in 2011 and 2014. The theoretical part of the thesis {{deals with the}} history and the present system, as well as the legislative changes in individual years. The end of the theoretical part characterizes <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> and its benefits. The beginning of the practical part is devoted to the model example of the calculation of <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> benefits, where we can observe the influence of adopted austerity measures. The second part analyzes the impact of changes to income and expenditures of <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance.</b> Expenditures have risen in recent years and are reaching the level of income, which may lead to the system´s financial incompetence. Furthermore, there is an analysis of the indicators of <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance,</b> mainly temporary incapacity for work, which shows that despite the reduction of the average length of one case, the average percentage of incapacity for work is increasing. Finally thesis analyzes the impact of changes on the circles of insured people and evaluates the impact of changes.

25|$|Pupils, {{students}} {{and children in}} kindergartens were incorporated into the accident insurance scheme, which benefited 11 million children. Free medical checkups were introduced that same year, while the Farmers' <b>Sickness</b> <b>Insurance</b> Law (1972) introduced compulsory <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> for independent farmers, family workers in agriculture, and pensioners under the farmers' pension scheme, medical benefits for all covered groups, and cash benefits for family workers under compulsory coverage for pension insurance. Participation in employer's health insurance was extended to four million employees. A Development Law of December 1970 {{made it possible for}} all employees voluntarily to become members of the statutory <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance.</b> The level of income for compulsory <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> was indexed to 75% of the respective assessment level for pension insurance, while voluntarily insured employees were granted a claim to an allowance towards their <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> from their employer. This law also introduced a new type of <b>sickness</b> <b>insurance</b> benefit, namely facilities for the early diagnosis of disease. Apart from the discretionary service of disease prevention which had existed since 1923, insured persons now had a right in certain circumstances to medical examinations aimed at the early diagnosis of disease. According to one study, this marked a change in the concept of sickness insurance: it now aimed at securing good health.|$|R

40|$|The {{paper is}} {{motivated}} by a problem concerning the monotonicity of <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums</b> {{with respect to their}} loading parameter: the larger the parameter, the larger the <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> is expected to be. This property, usually called loading monotonicity, is satisfied by premiums that appear in the literature. The increased interest in constructing new <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums</b> has raised a question as to what weight functions would produce loading-monotonic premiums. In this paper we demonstrate a decisive role of log-supermodularity in answering this question. As a consequence, we establish - at a stroke - the loading monotonicity of a number of well-known <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums</b> and offer a host of further weight functions, and consequently of premiums, thus illustrating the power of the herein suggested methodology for constructing loading-monotonic <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This article {{considers}} {{the impact of}} risk management and monitoring costs on insurer’s monitoring activities and investigates the relationship between risk management and monitoring activities and setting {{the level of the}} <b>insurance</b> <b>premium.</b> The main results of this article are as follows. First, a firm always undertakes risk management when the risk management cost is low. Second, when the insurer can spontaneously choose the level of the <b>insurance</b> <b>premium,</b> the insurer’s incentive to monitor the firm decreases, and risk management activities will not be promoted, because the cost of the accident can be directly reflected in the level of the <b>insurance</b> <b>premium.</b> In contrast, when the level of the <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> is exogenously decided, the insurer’s incentive to monitor the firm increases and risk management activities will be promoted, because the cost of accidents cannot be directly reflected in the level of the <b>insurance</b> <b>premium.</b> These results have the following implications for policy making. First, the results imply that policy should be designed to lower risk management costs by offering a platform for firms to exchange useful information with each other and/or reduce taxes for investments that lower risk management costs. Second, the results imply that both heavy <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> regulation and the <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> deregulation to realize a fierce competitive insurance market are desirable for promoting risk management activities...|$|R
