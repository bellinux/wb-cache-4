In the same year Podravka signed an agreement with the Croatian <b>spirituous</b> <b>beverages</b> producer Badel 1862 for exclusive distribution of Badel products in Slovenia.|$|E
50|$|The {{international}} trade of grapes, wine and <b>spirituous</b> <b>beverages</b> continues to grow. The share of export volumes of wine has developed significantly {{over the past}} decade: at over 100 million hectolitres, it is equivalent to 43% of world consumption, compared with 25% 10 years ago. Every two bottles out of five consumed {{in the world are}} imported.|$|E
50|$|Aside {{from the}} above, the Bureau also {{performs}} brand registration of all alcoholic beverages, the registration of all salesman for <b>spirituous</b> <b>beverages</b> and wines, and {{the issuance of}} cooperative pool buying approvals, wholesale alcoholic beverage licenses, wholesale cigarette and other tobacco products permits, retail cigarette and other tobacco products permits, common carrier licenses for airplanes, trains, boats and other vehicle permits.|$|E
40|$|Classification of Venezuelan <b>spirituous</b> <b>beverages</b> {{by means}} of {{discriminant}} analysis and artificial neural networks based on their Zn, Cu and Fe concentrations (Hernández C., Edwin A.; Ávila G., Rita M.; Capote, Tarcisio; Rivas E., Francklin I.; Pérez M., Anna G.) Abstract Copper, zinc and iron concentrations were determined in ''aguardiente de Cocuy de Penca'' (Cocuy de Penca firewater), a spirituous beverage very popular in the North-Western region of Venezuela, by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). These elements were selected for their presence {{can be traced to}} the (illegal) manufacturing process of the aforementioned beverages. Linear and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), and artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained with the backpropagation algorithm were employed for estimating if such beverages can be distinguished based on the concentrations of these elements in the final product, and whether it is possible to assess the geographic location of the manufacturers (Lara or Falco´n states) and the presence or absence of sugar in the end product. A linear discriminant analysis (LDA) performed poorly, overall estimation and prediction rates being 51. 7 % and 50. 0 %, respectively. A QDA showed a slightly better overall performance, yet unsatisfactory (estimation: 79. 2 %, prediction: 72. 5 %). Various ANNs, comprising a linear function (L) in the input layer, a sigmoid function (S) in the hidden layer(s) and a hyperbolic tangent function (T) in the output layer, were evaluated. Of the networks studied, the (3 L: 5 S: 7 S: 4 T) gave the highest estimation (overall: 96. 5 %) and prediction rates (overall: 97. 0 %), demonstrating the superb performance of ANNs for classification purposes.
