2500|$|One {{afternoon}} at sunset I was <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> golden hilltop, rejoicing that British women {{had just been}} enfranchised and American women would soon be politically free ... when suddenly, as in a vision, I saw {{that out of the}} hideous world war might come as a glorious aftermath international industrial justice and international peace...I also saw as part of my vision that the coming of equal opportunity for the manual workers of the world might be hastened by utilizing the deep sex sympathy that women now feel for each other before it has had time to grow less.|$|E

6000|$|I was {{wishing for}} a cheerful friend one night, {{when all of}} a sudden I found one; for, <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> hand, I saw a plump, jolly-looking fly. He sat quietly staring at me, with a mild little hum, as if to say,-- ...|$|E
60|$|How long I {{lay there}} enraptured with {{the beauty of}} light and mystery of shade, thrilling at the lonesome lament of the owl, I have no means to tell; but I was awakened from my trance by the touch of {{something}} crawling over me. Promptly I raised my head. The cave was as light as day. There, <b>sitting</b> sociably <b>on</b> <b>my</b> sleeping-bag was a great black tarantula, as large as my hand.|$|R
60|$|While fever {{producing}} torpor, heavy pains, <b>sitting</b> like lead <b>on</b> <b>my</b> limbs, {{and making}} my breast heave, were upon me; I continued insensible to every thing but pain, {{and at last}} even to that. I awoke on the fourth morning as from a dreamless sleep. An irritating sense of thirst, and, when I strove to speak or move, an entire dereliction of power, was all I felt.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My friends,' said I, <b>sitting</b> up <b>on</b> <b>my</b> bed, 'I do not {{understand}} very much of what you say, but when you speak like that it is foolishness. We {{know so much about}} fighting in France, that we have paid our little visit to nearly every capital in Europe, and very soon we are coming to London. But we fight like soldiers, you understand, and not like gamins in the gutter. You strike me on the head. I kick you on the knee. It is child's play. But if you will give me a sword, and take another one, I will show you how we fight over the water.' ...|$|R
6000|$|My {{companion}} did not stir. Only {{the flames}} waved silently along the logs. The beam of sunlight drew across the floor. The crisp {{air of the}} pasture flowed through the window. What wonder, then, that, <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> stool, I fell asleep! ...|$|E

30|$|Firefighters {{reported}} discomfort from ill-fitting {{face masks}} {{when they were}} worn with the helmet as such: “When I have <b>my</b> mask <b>on,</b> I can’t push my helmet down where its comfortable so I feel like it’s <b>sitting</b> up higher <b>on</b> <b>my</b> head and I have to crank my chin strap down {{to keep it from}} falling off and it just doesn’t marry up well <b>on</b> <b>my</b> face, and it’s probably because my face is smaller (Site # 2).” Some firefighters also reported the itchiness of the hood, especially when it is wet.|$|R
5000|$|Regarding his 1980 work on The Empire Strikes Back, Jung recalled: [...] "I used various {{martial arts}} attitudes in my working studies, {{trying to come}} up with the perfect look. I was searching for the image 'bi-coastal' (as they used to say) of Darth Vader, which could be the {{centerpiece}} for The Empire Strikes Back. I made the presentation to Sid Ganis at Lucasfilm's new offices in North Hollywood, near Universal Studios. In the large airy reception area <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> couches, with <b>my</b> presentation spread <b>on</b> a coffee table, we attracted a small crowd of onlookers. Steven Spielberg peered in and chimed, 'I like that' and strolled away. It was the drawing of Darth Vader in profile, a powerful outstretched arm holding his saber." ...|$|R
60|$|Now it is {{just here}} that the chief {{difficulty}} occurs. It arises from the very rarity and rectitude of those minds which commonly inaugurate such crusades. I have the warmest respect for Dr. Horton's thirst after righteousness; but it has always {{seemed to me that}} his righteousness would be more effective without his refinement. The curse of the Nonconformists is their universal refinement. They dimly connect being good with being delicate, and even dapper; with not being grotesque or loud or violent; with not <b>sitting</b> down <b>on</b> one's hat. Now it is always a pleasure to be loud and violent, and sometimes it is a duty. Certainly {{it has nothing to do}} with sin; a man can be loudly and violently virtuous--nay, he can be loudly and violently saintly, though that is not the type of saintliness that we recognise in Dr. Horton. And as for <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> one's hat, if it is done for any sublime object (as, for instance, to amuse the children), it is obviously an act of very beautiful self-sacrifice, the destruction and surrender of the symbol of personal dignity upon the shrine of public festivity. Now it will not do to attack the modern editor merely for being unrefined, like the great mass of mankind. We must be able to say that he is immoral, not that he is undignified or ridiculous. I do not mind the Yellow Press editor <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> his hat. <b>My</b> only objection to him begins to dawn when he attempts to sit <b>on</b> <b>my</b> hat; or, indeed (as is at present the case), when he proceeds to sit <b>on</b> <b>my</b> head.|$|R

60|$|DEARTH. It's gone. (He looks ruefully at her.) I'll {{tell you}} how it went. We were fishing in a stream--that is to say, I was wading and you were <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> {{shoulders}} holding the rod. We didn't catch anything.

60|$|I {{came home}} to quiet tea and a black kitten called Sweep, who lapped half my cream jugful (and yet I had plenty) <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder,--and Life of Sir Walter Scott.

60|$|For {{the moment}} I did {{nothing more than}} wink at the fat old thing, but the next morning I had my arm round her waist--a metre and a quarter, Sir, where it was tied in the middle--and had {{imprinted}} a kiss upon her glossy cheek. What that love-making cost me I cannot attempt to describe. Once Estelle {{came into the kitchen}} when I was staggering under a load of a hundred kilos <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> knee.

[...] "Must I be all the time cleaning after you fellows? Blast ye! I spent an hour on that 'ere gun-carriage this very mornin'. But it all comes of White-Jacket there.

40|$|At Yale for {{the last}} two years, I 2 ̆ 7 ve been working with Professor Gayl Westerman, <b>sitting</b> here <b>on</b> <b>my</b> right, who is a {{professor}} at Pace University School of Law and holds a doctorate from Yale on maritime boundaries. In {{the course of the last}} year, we have become more and more concerned with the complete deterioration of any disciplined regime with regard to baselines, and it has become quite apparent that the consequences are very deleterious for any effective public order of the oceans. We have been doing some work on this, and it seemed that it would be appropriate to present it to a group of experts in international law in general and specialists in international maritime law in particular, to see what the reactions might be. I know that many of you here are concerned with this problem in a professional or scholarly fashion, and I know that some of you share the concerns that Gayl Westerman and I have. The seminar might proceed best if I were given 25 or 30 minutes to set out the basic thesis of our concern, and perhaps a brief bibliographical review for those of you who are working on this, and then try to move our discussion on to an inquiry into a variety of problems that we think, as yet, are unresolved...|$|R
6000|$|... "So, I {{goes to a}} livery {{stable and}} hires a buggy <b>on</b> <b>my</b> looks. I drove out to the Plunkett farm and hitched.

If {{we had not}} promised my {{daughter}} and her husband that we would stay away for a month, I should go directly home and superintend my jelly-making and fruit-preserving; but as I cannot do that, I have determined to act out my own self here.

60|$|One day, as I was <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> rock, {{there came}} by that way a {{somewhat}} gaunt peasant {{wrapped in a}} mantle. He was a stranger, and plainly did not know me even by repute; for, instead of keeping the other side, he drew near and sat down beside me, and we had soon fallen in talk. Among other things {{he told me he}} had been a muleteer, and in former years had much frequented these mountains; later on, he had followed the army with his mules, had realised a competence, and was now living retired with his family.|$|E

"When poor young Bond {{first came}} to London," [...] said the massive gentleman who was <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> left, [...] "I {{remember}} his telling me he applied to Lord Barrymore's 'tiger,' Alexander Lee, I mean, of course, who was then running the Strand Theatre, for {{a place in the}} chorus. Lee heard him sing two lines, and then jumped up. 'Thanks, that'll do; good morning,' says Lee. Bond knew he had got a good voice, so he asked Lee what was wrong. 'What's wrong?' shouts Lee. 'Do you think I hire a chorus to show up my principals?'" ...|$|E

40|$|Well Jake {{is officially}} 48 hours young. I still haven't slept. Jake is calm, placid and resting, yet inside me I can feel panic raging. The ward’s call bells sound {{all through the}} night. I’m so tired. I wander around the ward hoping someone will engage with me. The nights are so lonely. The {{hospital}} is so lonely, everyone drawing their curtains. I ended up <b>sitting</b> back <b>on</b> <b>my</b> bed twisting a handful of tissue into a tightly wound band and sniffing back the tears. A young nurse noticed me. She sat talking with me, sharing her stories of motherhood. Other nurses took respite as they indulged in fresh-baked teacake I had given them earlier in the day. I couldn’t eat it. I couldn’t eat at all. They all chatted about their families. I wonder how they survived becoming mothers and actually returned to the real world. I went to visit Jake today, if I didn’t have to work I’d be there all the time. I guess it’s a good thing as they can rest while I’m away. Margie seemed down. A lady from work was telling me about baby blues. She gave me a site to look up. The Black Dog Institute site was sharing information about many forms of depression. Apparently mood swings and teariness is common in new mums, affecting 50 to 80 per cent of women. So I guess there’s nothing to be concerned about. Things should settle down within a week...|$|R
40|$|Title: EMG Analysis of Back Muscles during various Types of Sitting Position Purposes: The {{purpose of}} the thesis is the {{assessment}} of EMG activity of back muscles while <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> a chair without any back support, and while <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> a gymball. Methods: Surface electromyography - recording EMG activity of back muscles (20 minutes <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> a chair and 20 minutes <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> a gymball). Results: The mean muscle activity of all probands while <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> a chair is higher than while <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> a gymball. Muscle fatigue of back muscles occurs faster when <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> a gymball than when <b>sitting</b> <b>on</b> a chair.
