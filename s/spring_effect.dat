40|$|A simple {{model of}} {{non-linear}} and chaotic dynamic behaviour of buckled plates is presented. Special procedures are described {{for setting up}} the tests of flat and buckled plates with vibrations of large amplitude. The dificulties of measuring chaotic motion include the problems in designing the clampingfixtures, controlling the excitation and analysing the results. Case studies of tests with shaker direct attachment, base excitation, and acoustic excitation are used to illustrate the procedures and ways to solve the various problems. The important non-linear dynamic characteristics of curved plates {{are found to be}} the transition from softening <b>spring</b> <b>effects</b> to hardening <b>spring</b> <b>effects</b> through the intermediate region of chaotic motion. The chaotic motion is a large amplitude dynamic snap-through motion between the two static buckled positions of the plate.

50|$|Sockets and {{extensions}} for impact wrenches {{are made}} of high tensile metal, as any <b>spring</b> <b>effect</b> will greatly reduce the torque available at the fastener. Even so, {{the use of multiple}} extensions, universal joints, and so forth will weaken the impacts, and the operator needs to minimize their use. Using non-impact sockets or accessories with an impact wrench will often result in bending, fracturing, or otherwise damaging the accessory, as most are not capable of withstanding the sudden high torque of an impact tool, and can result in stripping the head on the fastener. Non-impact sockets and accessories {{are made of}} a harder more brittle metal. Safety glasses should always be worn when working with impact tools, as the strong impacts can generate high-speed shrapnel if a socket, accessory, or fastener fails.|$|E

5000|$|In a {{hydropneumatic}} suspension system, each wheel is connected, {{not to a}} spring, but to a hydraulic suspension unit consisting of a hydraulic accumulator sphere of about 12 cm in diameter containing pressurised nitrogen, a cylinder containing hydraulic fluid screwed to the suspension sphere, a piston inside the cylinder connected by levers to the suspension itself, and a damper valve between the piston and the sphere. A membrane in the sphere prevented the nitrogen from escaping. The motion of the wheels translated to a motion of the piston, which acted on the oil in the nitrogen cushion and provided the <b>spring</b> <b>effect.</b> The damper valve took place of the shock absorber in conventional suspensions. The hydraulic cylinder was fed with hydraulic fluid from the main pressure reservoir via a height corrector, a valve controlled by the mid-position of the anti-roll bar connected to the axle. If the suspension was too low, the height corrector introduced high-pressure fluid; if it was too high, it released fluid back to the fluid reservoir. In this manner, a constant ride height was maintained. A control in the cabin allowed the driver to select one of five heights: normal riding height, two slightly higher riding heights for poor terrain, and two extreme positions for changing wheels. (The correct term, oleopneumatic (oil-air), has never gained widespread use. Hydropneumatic (water-air) continues to be preferred overwhelmingly.) ...|$|E
5000|$|It was an American named Isaac Cole {{who first}} {{took out a}} patent for {{the process of the}} {{production}} of molded wood in 1874. He designed a chair made of glue-laminated wooden strips.However, in 1830 the famous furniture designer Michael Thonet had already begun to experiment with the gluing of veneer layers. He only managed to produce two-dimensional deformations though. He stopped these experiments and developed the bentwood process to produce three-dimensional molded wood components made of solid wood. With the model S43, the company [...] "Gebrüder Thonet" [...] launched the first cantilever chair in 1931. To make the chair very comfortable without padding and to give it a light appearance, designer Mart Stam used three-dimensionally shaped plywood parts for its seat and back. The Finn Alvar Aalto was the first to deliberately implement the natural <b>spring</b> <b>effect</b> of the material when he created his model [...] "Piamio" [...] in the 1930s. Marcel Breuer created the Long Chair in 1935-1936 (see image). Five years later, the architects and designers Charles Eames and Eero Saarinen won a furniture design competition in New York with a three-dimensionally shaped shell. After that, Charles Eames and his wife Ray developed the spectacular plywood furniture collection for the company Herman Miller (USA). In Europe, Arne Jacobsen presented a chair with the unusual name [...] "Ant (chair)" [...] in 1952 that should later become a great success. Seat and back are self-supporting and connected by a narrow waist. These million-selling classics are still in production today.|$|E
30|$|Frequency tuning of an AVC-driven microscanner was {{demonstrated}} by utilizing the electromechanical <b>spring</b> <b>effect.</b> The resonant frequency was tuned by applying a dc tuning voltage up to 30  V to the tuning comb electrode with four different driving voltages. A maximum frequency shift of 3.2 % was achieved, as the resonant frequency of 3167  Hz {{was reduced to}} 3066  Hz when a tuning voltage of 30  V {{was applied to the}} tuning comb electrode. Further, the frequency shift of the microscanner was unidirectional. The application of a tuning voltage reduced the resonant frequency because of the spring-softening characteristics of the electromechanical <b>spring</b> <b>effect</b> for the given AVC-driven geometries. By utilizing the electromechanical <b>spring</b> <b>effect</b> of the AVC drive, frequency tuning of the microscanner was achieved without adding any permanent modification to the device structures.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this project, it {{is planned}} {{to carry out}} a {{complete}} microstructural characterization of advanced high strength steels (AHSS) currently used in the automotive industry. These steels have an elastic <b>effect,</b> called <b>spring</b> back <b>effect,</b> during the sheet metal forming of parts. This spring back is the main problem of this family of steels during the production process of the structural components of the automotive industry: especially for dimensional problems in automotive structural components. It is therefore necessary to evaluate changes in microstructure during the stages of sheet metal forming in order to know precisely the microstructural and mechanical behavior of material after being subjected to this effect. Steels studied in this research work are currently used by all major automobile industries, which are dual-phase (DP) 600 and 780. The <b>spring</b> back <b>effect</b> mechanical characterization was performed by means of a mechanical bending test, called as Air Bending. The results indicate that the <b>spring</b> back <b>effect</b> in the DP 780 has the highest spring back rate due to its high mechanical strength due to Hall-Petchphenomenom. The comparison of analyses EBSD before and after bending tests showed a relation between the misorientation of grains and the <b>spring</b> back <b>effect.</b> The results obtained by microstructure analysis of EBSD confirmed the tendency of DP 780 absorb a greater amount of energy during the deformation, thus resulting in greater springback effect...|$|R

The introduction of the balance <b>spring</b> <b>effected</b> an enormous increase in the accuracy of pocketwatches, from perhaps several hours per day to 10 minutes per day, making them useful timekeepers for the first time.

40|$|An optical <b>spring</b> <b>effect</b> {{has been}} {{observed}} in the motion of a Fabry-Perot cavity suspended in the Low-Frequency Facility, R&D experiment of the VIRGO Collaboration. The experimental setup consists of a 1 -cm-long cavity hanging from a mechanical isolation system, conceived to suppress seismic noise transmission to the optical components of the interferometer. The observed radiation pressure effect corresponds to an optical stiffness k(opt) ranging between 2. 5 x 10 (4) and 6. 5 x 10 (4) N/m. This paper reports several measurements of the mirror relative displacement carried out in different working conditions. The measured error signal spectra show broad resonances at frequencies compatible with the optomechanical system. In other runs cavity detuning oscillations have been observed at subhertz frequencies. In these cases the power spectrum of the control loop error signal exhibited a broad resonance with superimposed uniformly spaced peaks.

30|$|The {{non-linear}} {{free vibration}} of moderately thick FGMs clamped isosceles triangular plates was analyzed by a triangular p-element. The material {{properties of the}} functionally graded triangular plate assumed to be graded only in the thickness direction according to a simple power law distribution {{in terms of the}} volume fraction of the constituents. The shape functions of triangular finite p-element are obtained by the shifted orthogonal polynomials of Legendre. The components of stiffness and mass matrices were calculated using numerical integration of Gauss-Legendre. The equations of motion are obtained from Lagrange's equation in combination with the harmonic balance method (HBM). Results for linear and non-linear frequency for the lowest three modes of FGMs clamped isosceles triangular plates were obtained. The parametric studies show that the boundary conditions have a great influence on the shape of the backbone curves, the hardening <b>spring</b> <b>effect</b> decreases for clamped FG plate. For simply supported FG plate and by increasing thickness ratio and sector angle of FG plates the hardening <b>spring</b> <b>effect</b> increases. A increase in the volume fraction exponent produces a variation in the hardening <b>spring</b> <b>effect</b> with an increasing part and another decreasing part, the peak in the curves of the nonlinear-to-linear fundamental frequency ratio FG triangular plate is obtained around of n[*]=[*] 1 at which the hardening behavior is maximum, and is obtained for AL/AL 2 O 3 FG plate. This value of volume fraction exponent corresponds to equal mixtures of metal and ceramic in the composition of the FG plate. Not only the hardening behavior is influenced by this mixture but the non-linear mode shape of FG isosceles triangular plate is also influenced.|$|E

40|$|Structural health {{monitoring}} techniques based on vibration data have received increasing attention in recent years. Since the measured modal characteristics and the transient motion of a beam exhibit low sensitivity to damage, numerical techniques for accurately computing vibration characteristics are needed.

The trial and the test functions are constructed using the Generalized Moving Least Squares (GMLS) approximation.

40|$|International audienceWe {{report on}} the first dynamic study of {{acoustical}} <b>spring</b> <b>effect</b> in a compliant cavity formed between a spherical ultrasonic transducer immersed in water and the free liquid surface located at its focus.

We use surface waves to investigate the acoustical <b>spring</b> <b>effect.</b> The amplitude of surface waves above the cavity is observed to vary with the slope of variation of the L-dependent acoustic radiation pressure exerted on the liquid surface, i. e. with the acoustic spring stiffness. The observed simultaneous back-scattering of these surface waves demonstrates that the surface response to the cavity length variations results mainly in an added stiffness, i. e., in an increase of the real part of the surface impedance above the cavity. Finally, when the liquid surface is located out of the focal plane, spontaneous surface oscillations are reproducibly observed, which may be due to a parametric instability...|$|E
40|$|The {{preparation}} of a mechanical oscillator driven by quantum back-action {{is a fundamental}} requirement to reach the standard quantum limit (SQL) for force measurement, in optomechanical systems. However, thermal fluctuating force generally dominates a disturbance on the oscillator. In the macroscopic scale, an optical linear cavity including a suspended mirror {{has been used for}} the weak force measurement, such as gravitational-wave detectors. This configuration has the advantages of reducing the dissipation of the pendulum (i. e., suspension thermal noise) due to a gravitational dilution by using a thin wire, and of increasing the circulating laser power. However, the use of the thin wire is weak for an optical torsional anti-spring effect in the cavity, due to the low mechanical restoring force of the wire. Thus, there is the trade-off between the stability of the system and the sensitivity. Here, we describe using a triangular optical cavity to overcome this limitation for reaching the SQL. The triangular cavity can provide a sensitive and stable system, because it can optically trap the mirror's motion of the yaw, through an optical positive torsional <b>spring</b> <b>effect.</b> To show this, we demonstrate a measurement of the torsional <b>spring</b> <b>effect</b> caused by radiation pressure forces.

Soils from lower elevation plots, which accumulated less snow and experienced more soil temperature variability during the winter (and likely more freeze/thaw events), had less extractable inorganic nitrogen (N), lower rates of microbial N production via potential net N mineralization and nitrification, and higher potential microbial respiration during the growing season.
