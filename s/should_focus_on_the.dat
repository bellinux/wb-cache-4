5|$|During the 2011 Canadian federal election, Harper {{promised to}} {{establish}} the NAP-CHT by 2012 and to invest $20 million into it. The annual budget of British Columbia's Office to Combat Trafficking in Persons (OCTIP) was reduced by $200,000 a few months later. OCTIP was Canada's only provincial government agency responsible for coordinating efforts to address human trafficking. The federal government held a round table to determine {{the contents of the}} NAP-CHT. Carleen McGuinty, child protection specialist for the Christian NGO World Vision Canada, said at the discussion that the NAP-CHT <b>should</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> needs of children and that the plan should not emphasize child sexual abuse to the exclusion of addressing child labour. Smith said that she was confident that Harper would have her review the plan before it was established. The government consulted ACT Alberta, The Salvation Army, and the AAMS {{in the development of the}} plan.|$|E

25|$|The {{financial}} problems were cause {{by a lack}} of focus on single market segments. ND had bought several software and hardware companies without a defined strategy, and often without adding new segments to the portfolio, as they often had overlapping products. The purchases were made in the hope that new software would bring new clients to choose ND hardware, which was the only product ND made profits from. Rolf Skår stated in 1988 that the company <b>should</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> banking industry, but this was never carried out. Sales had continued to fall during 1989, as customers were concerned that the Sintran-based product line would be discontinued.|$|E

25|$|In this {{therapeutic}} setting, {{the family}} is urged not to condone or reward the FD individual's behavior. This form of treatment can be unsuccessful if {{the family is}} uncooperative or displays signs of denial and/or antisocial disorder. Psychotherapy is another method used to treat the disorder. These sessions <b>should</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> psychiatrist's establishing and maintaining {{a relationship with the}} patient. Such a relationship may help to contain symptoms of FD. Monitoring is also a form that may be indicated for the FD patient's own good; FD (especially proxy) can be detrimental to an individual's health—if they are, in fact, causing true physiological illnesses. Even faked illnesses/injuries can be dangerous, and might be monitored for fear that unnecessary surgery may subsequently be performed.|$|E
25|$|According to the National Alliance to End Homelessness, {{outreach}} {{services to}} help sexually exploited youth <b>should</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> locations where they congregate and are approached by pimps for exploitation, including public spaces such as malls and schools, and the internet. Outreach {{workers need to}} develop a close professional relationship with law enforcement to learn about trends and locations, but should carefully avoid compromising their independence or the confidentiality of their clients. Local law enforcement should target pimps and customers (janes or johns) and not the victims (youth and young adult prostitutes) for prosecution to be effective. Partnerships between nonprofit programs and law enforcement can help offer survival sex worker victims community-based services and housing when they are picked up by police officers.|$|E
25|$|Many parents {{opposed to}} {{providing}} the HPV vaccine to their pre-teens agree the vaccine {{is safe and}} effective, but find talking to their children about sex uncomfortable. Dr. Elizabeth Lange, of Waterman Pediatrics in Providence, RI, addresses this concern by emphasizing what the vaccine is doing for the child. Dr. Lange suggests parents <b>should</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cancer prevention aspect without being distracted by words like 'sexually transmitted'. Everyone wants cancer prevention, yet here parents are denying their children a form of protection {{due to the nature}} of the cancer—Lagne suggests that this much controversy would not surround a breast cancer or colon cancer vaccine. The HPV vaccine is suggested for 11-year-olds because it should be administered before possible exposure to HPV, yes, but also because the immune system has the highest response for creating antibodies around this age. Dr. Lange also emphasized the studies showing that the HPV vaccine does not cause children to be more promiscuous than they would be without the vaccine.|$|E

25|$|There {{originally}} {{was a brief}} shot in the scene where Bambi's mother dies of her jumping over a log and getting shot by man. Larry Morey, however, felt the scene was too dramatic, {{and that it was}} emotional enough to justify having her death occurring off screen. Walt Disney was also eager to show man burned to death by his fire that he inadvertently started, but this was discarded when it was decided not to show man at all. There was also a scene involving two autumn leaves conversing like an old married couple before parting ways and falling to the ground, but Disney found that talking flora did not work {{in the context of the}} film, and instead a visual metaphor of two realistic leaves falling to the ground was used instead. Disney and his story team also developed the characters consisting of a squirrel and a chipmunk that were to be a comic duo reminiscent of Laurel and Hardy. However, after years of experimentation, Walt felt that the story <b>should</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> three principal characters: Bambi, Thumper and Flower. The squirrel and chipmunk make only brief appearances in the final film.|$|E
500|$|In 1988, Francisco J. Ayala defined {{progress}} as [...] "systematic {{change in a}} feature belonging to {{all the members of}} a sequence {{in such a way that}} posterior members of the sequence exhibit an improvement of that feature". He argued that there are two elements in this definition, directional change and improvement according to some standard. Whether a directional change constitutes an improvement is not a scientific question; therefore Ayala suggested that science <b>should</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> question of whether there is directional change, without regard to whether the change is [...] "improvement". This may be compared to Stephen Jay Gould's suggestion of [...] "replacing the idea of progress with an operational notion of directionality".|$|E
500|$|In mid-June Arnold visited LeMay's {{headquarters}} at Saipan. During this visit he approved {{a proposal for}} XXIBomber Command to attack 25 relatively small cities with populations ranging from 62,280 to 323,000 while also continuing precision raids on major targets. This decision was made despite a recommendation from the United States Strategic Bombing Survey (USSBS) team, which was assessing the effectiveness of air attacks on Germany, that operations against Japan <b>should</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> country's transportation network and other targets {{with the goal of}} crippling the movement of goods and destroying food supplies. LeMay's plan called for precision attacks on important industrial targets on days when the weather over Japan was clear and incendiary attacks guided by radar on overcast days. As both the cities and industrial facilities targeted were relatively small, the B-29 force would be sent against multiple locations on days in which attacks were conducted. This targeting policy, which was labeled the [...] "Empire Plan", remained in force until {{the last days of the}} war.|$|E

500|$|... "Margaritaville" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by series co-founder Trey Parker. It first aired on March 25, 2009 in the United States on Comedy Central. Parker and fellow co-creator Matt Stone said they had long planned to do an episode about the global recession, and they argued over whether to start the season with an episode about the economy, or [...] "The Ring," [...] an episode mocking the Jonas Brothers, a boy band which had recently grown in popularity. Stone argued the season premiere <b>should</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> economy because it was the biggest news item at the time, but Parker felt they needed more time to craft the script, and that the Jonas Brothers would be a funny season opener. Stone ultimately agreed, and later admitted it was the right decision. During an interview {{a few weeks before the}} episode aired, Stone said, [...] "That's one of those big things we want to get right. We'll be talking about what kind of social commentary we want to make and do it right." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Ring" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by series co-founder Trey Parker. It was first broadcast on March 11, 2009 in the United States on Comedy Central, and then aired two days later on satellite Paramount Comedy in the United Kingdom. It was the first episode of South Parks thirteenth season and the first episode to be broadcast in high-definition (HD). Parker and Stone argued over whether to start the season with a Jonas Brothers episode or a show about the economic recession, which they had been planning to do for some time. Stone argued they <b>should</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> economy because it was the biggest news item at the time, but Parker felt they needed more time to craft the script, and that the Jonas Brothers would be a funny season opener. Stone ultimately agreed, and later admitted it was the right decision. An episode about the economy entitled [...] "Margaritaville" [...] was shown later in the season. By March 8, three days before the episode premiered, the script was only half-finished and the animation was not yet complete, in keeping with the practice of show creators Parker and Matt Stone to finish episodes upon last-minute deadlines; Stone said of the practice, [...] "We don't do a live show, but we kind of harness some of that energy. We kind of need that to work. We're, like, 'We have to do something right now. It's going on the air in just a few minutes.'" ...|$|E

Others, such as Tadjbakhsh and Chenoy, argue that human development and human security are inextricably linked since progress in one enhances the chances of progress in another while failure in one increases risk of failure of another.|$|E
