40|$|A {{numerical}} {{technique is}} {{developed for the}} analysis of dissipative silencers of arbitrary, but axially uniform, cross section. Mean gas flow is included in a central airway which is separated from a bulk reacting porous material by a concentric perforate screen. The analysis begins by employing the finite element method to extract the eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors for a silencer of infinite length. Point collocation is then used to match the expanded acoustic pressure and velocity fields in the <b>silencer</b> <b>chamber</b> to those in the inlet and outlet pipes. Transmission loss predictions are compared with experimental measurements taken for two automotive dissipative silencers with elliptical cross sections. Good agreement between prediction and experiment is observed both without mean flow and for a mean flow Mach number of 0. 15. It is demonstrated also that the technique presented offers a considerable reduction in computational expenditure when compared to a three dimensional finite element analysis. 2 I...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} a mathematical approach {{based on the}} point collocation technique to compute the transmission loss of perforated dissipative silencers with transversal temperature gradients and mean flow. Three-dimensional wave propagation is considered in silencer geometries with arbitrary, but axially uniform, cross section. To reduce the computational requirements of a full multidimensional finite element calculation, a method is developed combining axial and transversal solutions of the wave equation. First, the finite element method is employed in a two-dimensional problem to extract the eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors for the silencer cross section. Mean flow as well as transversal temperature gradients and the corresponding thermal-induced material heterogeneities {{are included in the}} model. In addition, an axially uniform temperature field is taken into account, its value being the inlet/outlet average. A point collocation technique is then used to match the acoustic fields (pressure and axial acoustic velocity) at the geometric discontinuities between the <b>silencer</b> <b>chamber</b> and the inlet and outlet pipes. Transmission loss predictions are compared favorably with a general three-dimensional finite element approach, offering a reduction in the computational effort...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. An array which possess more {{array element}} number and whose {{frequency}} of the drive signal can be as large as possible in a range, directivity will be more preferable. On the other hand, when {{the structure of the}} sound radiating surface of the transducer or array layout is symmetrical, the corresponding directivity pattern will be symmetrical. In order to test transducer ’ directivity, two methods are designed. The one is to measure the ultrasonic sound pressure level by instruments. The sound pressure level is measured at multiple points to deduce the directivity angle of the acoustic transducer array. The beam width of the 3 × 3 array is about 203 ≤Θ − dB at 23 kHz, and the directivity acute angle is about 10 °; higher frequencies will lead to the side lobes, but it can be negligible when compared to the main lobe. The other method is using the frequency analyzer to test transducer directivity in a <b>silencer</b> <b>chamber.</b> The sound pressure level can be read out from frequency response diagrams. The angle between the sound pressure value that decreasing 3 db from the max value 111. 7 db and the max value is about 11 °. So the directivity acute angle is about 11 °. It should be noticed that, as the directivity diagram can not be directly attributed, there is some deviation in the conclusion...|$|E

40|$|The {{boundary}} element method (BEM) {{is frequently}} employed {{to predict the}} transmission loss (TL) of an expansion <b>chamber</b> <b>silencer</b> with a rigid walled boundary, while {{the effect of the}} vibration of the end plates of the expansion <b>chamber</b> <b>silencer</b> is usually ignored. However, when the airflow or acoustic pressure in a duct is large and the end plate of the expansion <b>chamber</b> <b>silencer</b> is not thick enough, the effect of the vibration of the end plate should not be ignored. In this paper, based on a coupling of the BEM and the finite element method (FEM), the numerical results illustrate the existence of the effect on the TL of the vibrating end plates. Furthermore, numerical experiments also show that for an expansion chamber of constant size, the thicker the end plate, the less influence the vibration of the end plate has on the TL. And this may be helpful for the design of silencer. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|The {{broadband}} {{sound attenuation}} characteristics of expansion <b>chamber</b> <b>silencers</b> {{can be altered}} by their internal configuration. Three-dimensional modeling of such systems, especially {{in the presence of}} complex internal partitions, remains a challenging task. In order to tackle the system complexity, this paper presents a systematic approach based on the sub-structuring modeling principle, to investigate the effects of several typical silencer configurations and provide guidelines for possible system optimization. Through numerical examples, the effects of various internal arrangements, including the side-branch partitions, multi-chamber partitions, non-symmetric inlet/outlet, and their combined effects are investigated. Numerical predictions show good agreements with both finite element method (FEM) and experiments. Investigations suggest some critical issues and possible solutions for better silencer design.

40|$|A sub-structuring approach, {{along with}} a unit cell treatment, is {{proposed}} to model expansion <b>chamber</b> <b>silencers</b> with internal partitions and micro-perforated panels (MPPs) {{in the absence of}} internal flow. The side-branch of the silencer is treated as a combination of unit cells connected in series. It is shown that, by connecting multiple unit cells with varying parameters, the noise attenuation bandwidth can be enlarged. With MPPs, the hybrid noise attenuation mechanism of the silencer is revealed. Depending {{on the size of the}} perforation hole, noise attenuation can be dominated by dissipative, reactive, or combined effects together. For a broadband sound absorption, the hole size, together with the perforation ratio and other parameters, can be optimized to strike a balance between the dissipative and reactive effect, for ultimately achieving the desired noise attenuation performance within a prescribed frequency region. The modular nature of the proposed formulation allows doing this in a flexible, accurate, and cost effective manner. The accuracy of the proposed approach is validated through comparisons with finite element method and experiments. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Transmission loss (TL) {{is often}} used to {{evaluate}} the acoustic attenuation performance of a silencer. In this work, a three-dimensional (3 D) finite element method (FEM) is employed to calculate the TL of some representative silencers, namely, circular expansion <b>chamber</b> <b>silencer</b> and straight-through perforated pipe silencer. In order to account for the effect of mean flow that exists inside the silencer, the 3 D FEM is used in conjunction with the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation of the flow field. More concretely, the 3 D mean flow field is computed by firstly using CFD, and then the obtained mean flow data are imported to an acoustic solution undertaken using FEM. The data transfer between the two steps is accomplished by mesh mapping. The results presented demonstrate good agreement between present TL predictions and previously published experimental and numerical works. Also, the details of the flow inside the silencers may be studied. Furthermore, the effect of mean flow velocity on acoustic attenuation performance of the silencers is investigated. It is concluded that for the studied silencers, in general, increasing flow velocity increases the TL and decreases the resonance peaks...|$|R
