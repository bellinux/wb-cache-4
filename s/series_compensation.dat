Meanwhile, with the rapid development of the power electronics, flexible AC transmission system (FACTS) devices are widely used in the power system [6, 7, 8, 9]. With the ability of controlling multi electrical parameters, e.g. the bus voltage and the active/reactive power of the transmission line, unified power flow controller (UPFC) is the most versatile FACTS so far [7].
