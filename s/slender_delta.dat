Forebody and wing vortex flow mechanisms were identified through off-body flow visualizations to explain the trends in the longitudinal and lateral-directional characteristics at extreme attitudes (angles of attack and sideslip). The interactins of the vortical motions with centerline and wing-mounted vertical tail surfaces were studied and the flow phenomena were correlated with the configuration forces and moments. Single degree-of-freedom, free-to-roll tests were used to study the wing rock susceptibility of the generic fighter model.

40|$|This {{report is}} divided into three parts. The first two of these {{describe}} the A- 60, Mach 2. 2 airliner and the A- 62, Mach 3. 0 airliner design studies respectively. Apart from the different cruise speeds these two aircraft were designed to meet the same basic requirements and the third part of the report is a comparison of them. The Mach 2. 2 design was based upon the use of a <b>slender,</b> integrated, <b>delta</b> layout with six turbojet engines buried in the rear fuselage. It was intended to carry up to 120 passengers over transatlantic ranges. Although the chosen engine installation enabled a compact aircraft to be designed it did introduce severe structural and installation difficulties. A canard delta arrangement was proposed for the Mach 3. 0 aircraft. Drooping of the wing tips for supersonic flight was found to confer important stability advantages without introducing an unacceptable weight penalty. The steel structure was designed around the use of both corrugated reinforced and honeycomb sandwich skins, the former being preferable. An interesting feature was the choice of a sealed, cryogenic, environmental control system. This was found to be very attractive but as it proved to be somewhat heavier than anticipated it is suggested that a good compromise could be obtained by using a more conventional system for subsonic flight phases. The major conclusion from the comparison between the two study aircraft was that in many respects there is very little to choose between them. However the Mach 2. 2 aircraft represents a more logical step from existing airliner designs and presents fewer materials problems. As it is comparable economically it represents a better choice for a first generation supersonic design...|$|R
40|$|The {{hazardous}} {{consequences of}} a following aircraft encountering the wake turbulence of a large lead aircraft {{has been well documented}} and current practice of mandatory separation is less than ideal. The motivation of this project is to develop improved passive add-on devices that are both practical and efficient in alleviating this problem. Particle Image Velocimetry was used in a closed loop low speed wind tunnel to investigate the vortex structures of a half-span wing model with a <b>slender</b> reverse <b>delta</b> type add-on device in the landing configuration. The experimental setup is repeated for various angles of attack and roll angles, and different dimensions of the reverse delta type add-on device. This work investigates the characteristics of the resultant vortices produced by the reverse delta type add-on device, and the wingtip/flap-tip of the half-span wing model by analyzing the flow field in downstream planes perpendicular to the free stream direction. The vortex characteristics dependence on angle of attack and roll, at mean chord based Reynolds number is also analyzed. The peak tangential velocity, peak vorticity and the circulation magnitude of the resultant vortices produced downstream of the half-span wing model are explored. The results are analyzed thoroughly in order to determine if there is any significant decay in the resultant vortex structures. It was found that the reverse delta type add-on device reduces significantly the tangential velocity, vorticity and circulation magnitude by up to 82. 9 %, 92. 6 % and 42. 8 %, respectively and increases the resultant vortex core radius by a factor of 6. 57. As it is desirable that add-on devices have a minimal impact on the overall wing, a six component force balance was used to obtain the aerodynamic performance of the half-span wing model. It was found that the reverse delta type add-on device causes a maximum lift reduction of 4. 9 % and a maximum drag increment of 15. 2 %...|$|R

Higher speeds up to Mach 3 had been considered and found to be possible, but it appeared that a practical upper limit was Mach 2.2; above this speed the duralumin used for most aircraft construction would start to soften due to the heat of friction, and some new material would have to be used instead.|$|E
5000|$|Generally {{one wants}} to have the wing's centre of {{pressure}} (CP, or [...] "lift point") close to the aircraft's centre of gravity (CG, or [...] "balance point") {{to reduce the amount}} of control force required to pitch the aircraft.

With a normal wing design this can be addressed by moving the wing slightly fore or aft to account for this. With a delta wing running most of the length of the fuselage, this was no longer easy; moving the wing would leave it in front of the nose or behind the tail. Studying the various layouts in terms of CG changes, both during design and changes due to fuel use during flight, the ogee planform immediately came to the fore.While the wing planform was evolving, so was the basic SST concept.
