5|$|By January 2017, Long War Studios {{announced}} they {{have changed their}} name to Pavonis Interactive, and among other projects, are working with Firaxis to bring a new mod, Long War 2, in the <b>same</b> <b>vein</b> as the original Long War, to XCOM 2. The Long War 2 mod was released on January 19, 2017.|$|E

The ground colour of the forewings is white, with the basal {{half of a}} number of veins, the fold and the middle of the cell dashed with dark greyish fuscous. The underside is white, with the <b>same</b> <b>veins</b> marked with fuscous. The hindwings has the veins and dorsal half of the cell fuscous.|$|R

He quickly returned to punk rock and formed several bands, in much the <b>same</b> <b>vein</b> as the Ramones, for whom he also continued to write songs.|$|E
5|$|Narihira {{was not a}} {{profound}} poet. His surviving poems are mainly occasional, and even when the expression suggests deeply felt emotion, its worldly manner keeps his poetry from attaining {{the grandeur of the}} best Man'yōshū poems in the <b>same</b> <b>vein.</b> He is nevertheless of historical importance as one who maintained the traditions of the waka during the long night of the dominance of poetry in Chinese.|$|E
5|$|The {{mobile phone}} {{version of the}} game is {{primarily}} a beat 'em up with role-playing elements. Unlike the console versions the game plays as a side-scroller in the <b>same</b> <b>vein</b> as the 1992 X-Men arcade game. There are five selectable characters, and players upgrade each through experience points earned. Players control one character at a time, and can switch to another at the press of a button.|$|E

5000|$|As one {{journalist}} wrote, [...] "some {{have chosen}} a short, but sweet, route, while others have been incredibly elaborate in their surprise." [...] David D. of the blog Uproxx considered {{it to be the}} highest degree of rickrolling given how [...] "incredibly obnoxious" [...] the theme song is when it is played out of nowhere during a clip, but also called it a knock-off of the parts in WWE Slam City where John Cena and his theme song are also sometimes presented at an unexpected moment. The meme has also been labeled in the <b>same</b> <b>veins</b> as those of Dragon Ball Z, Shrek and Randy Orton's [...] "RKO from outta nowhere" [...] Vines.|$|R
50|$|Till fjälls ("To the Mountains") is {{the first}} {{full-length}} album by Swedish folk metal band Vintersorg. Stylistically this continued in the <b>same</b> musical <b>vein</b> as the previous album, Hedniskhjärtad, with black metal-style riffs, harsh vocals and blast beats interspersed with folk melodies, acoustics, and atmospherics.|$|R
5|$|A similar {{theory to}} Syme's {{has been put}} forward by François Paschoud, who claimed that Maximus was {{probably}} a satirical poet, in the <b>same</b> <b>vein</b> as Juvenal and not an imperial biographer at all. His argument rests on the point that, outside of the mentions in the History, the only extant referencing of Marius' work is always {{in the context of}} Juvenal, and that the History's description of him as a historian cannot be taken at face value, given how it invents or distorts so many other citations. This theory is rejected by historians such as Anthony Birley and David Rohrbacher.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} his {{supporting}} {{tour for}} Love Letter, Kelly underwent emergency throat surgery in July 2011 to drain an abscess on one of his tonsils. He recovered, and in August, announced that his next album will be called Black Panties, a sexually charged album in the <b>same</b> <b>vein</b> of his 1993 debut album, 12 Play. However, he deviated from that plan in January 2012 by announcing Write Me Back as his next album. He recorded the album at Sylvester Stone Studios and The Chocolate Factory in Chicago, and at MilkBoy The Studio in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Wily's Revenge is {{an action}} and {{platform}} game in <b>same</b> <b>vein</b> as the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) Mega Man games.

5000|$|The {{track was}} {{described}} by NME as,"a balls-out, low-down dirty rock song, and as fine a signature tune for the new Hole as you could imagine.

40|$|The {{reactivity}} of spiral strips and isolated {{segments of the}} lateral saphenal vein of the dog was investigated. In a first series of experiments the influence of progressively increasing distension on the isotonic or isometric reactions of both preparations to a constant electrical stimulation was examined. It appeared that in every case the reaction first increases with progressive distension. Whenever the venous wall becomes overstretched, the amplitude of the reaction diminishes gradually. In a second series of experiments, spiral strips and isolated segments were prepared from the <b>same</b> <b>veins</b> and their sensitivity to increasing stimulation frequencies tested at the optimal point of their distension-reaction relation, both in isotonic and isometric conditions. From these experiments {{it appeared that the}} isotonic preparations are more sensitive than the isometric, and that the sensitivity of the isolated segment is also greater than that of the spiral strip. © 1969 Springer-Verlag. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
5|$|In early 2009, McCann {{received}} a brief {{to create a}} new campaign for the latest entrant into the Halo series, a first-person shooter called Halo 3: ODST. It would be the first game in the franchise not to feature the series' protagonist, the Master Chief. McCann returned with a pitch for a campaign in the <b>same</b> <b>vein</b> as Believe, aiming to humanize the soldiers featured in the Halo universe. The project was greenlit, and McCann brought back several collaborators from Believe to handle this new campaign, now given the working title of The Life.|$|E
5|$|Stereotypical and {{historically}} inaccurate images of Indians in general interfere with learning about them by creating, supporting and maintaining oversimplified and inaccurate views {{of indigenous peoples}} and their cultures. When stereotypical representations are taken as factual information, they {{contribute to the development}} of cultural biases and prejudices, (clearly a contradiction to the educational mission of the University.) In the <b>same</b> <b>vein,</b> we believe that continuation of the use of Indians as symbols and mascots is incongruous with the philosophy espoused by many Americans as promoting inclusivity and diversity.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Jareth also underwent some significant developments {{during the early}} stages of pre-production. According to Henson he was originally meant to be another puppet creature in the <b>same</b> <b>vein</b> as his goblin subjects. Henson eventually decided he wanted a big, charismatic star to play the Goblin King, and decided to pursue a musician for the role. Sting, Prince, Mick Jagger, and Michael Jackson were considered for the part; however, it was ultimately decided that David Bowie would be the most suitable choice.|$|E
60|$|But, after all, the {{dominant}} current in those <b>same</b> <b>veins</b> {{was from the}} race of plain and prairie. The practiced eye detected it in the slender stateliness of carriage, in the graceful, yet voluptuous, curves of the lithe body, in the smallness and delicacy of hand and foot, in the purple sheen on straight-falling masses of blue-black hair, and, more than all else, in the long, dark eye, full and soft, yet alight with a slumbering fire. France, too, was responsible for somewhat in Tannis. It gave her a light step {{in place of the}} stealthy half-breed shuffle, it arched her red upper lip into a more tremulous bow, it lent a note of laughter to her voice and a sprightlier wit to her tongue. As for her red-headed Scotch grandfather, he had bequeathed her a somewhat whiter skin and ruddier bloom than is usually found in the breeds.|$|R
50|$|From 1565 until 1569 the {{architect}} Galeazzo Alessi played a decisive {{role in the}} renovation work, as did the Perugian architect Domenico Alfiano, and Valsesians Giovanni d’Enrico and Bartolomeo Ravelli. The sculptors, Tabacchetti, Giovanni D’Enrico, and painters like il Morazzone, Tanzio, Rocca, the Gherardini brothers, and the Gianoli brothers worked in the <b>same</b> artistic <b>vein</b> established by Gaudenzio Ferrari. However, Morazzone and the d’Enrico brothers, Giovanni and Tanzio, helped concretize the gran teatro montano.|$|R
50|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that Rex Ryan was a pseudonym used by Evelyn Bradley, a theatrical manager who was born in Waterloo, Lancashire, in December 1882, and who lived much of his adult life in Hove, Sussex. He is known to have written several plays in the <b>same</b> sensationalist <b>vein</b> as his novels. Ryan took his own life in October 1950. His daughter also wrote four thrillers in the 1940s under the name Kay Seaton.|$|R
5|$|The {{criticism}} {{against the}} artistic freedom of giving a personal {{interpretation of a}} distant historic event, could have been directed at many other historic paintings of the 19th century. The criticism against Midvinterblot {{would be in the}} <b>same</b> <b>vein</b> during the following years. Larsson retorted that he would happily delegate the task to a younger talent—but he made a second version in oil (№ 237) in which he made the temple wider and where he added an executioner in the centre. The sets of characters were more closely assembled and the frieze-like quality was enhanced.|$|E
5|$|The {{mission was}} part of a {{movement}} by Gregory to turn away from the East, and look to the Western parts of the old Roman Empire. After Gregory, a number of his successors as pope continued in the <b>same</b> <b>vein,</b> and maintained papal support for the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons. The missionary efforts of Augustine and his companions, along with those of the Hiberno-Scottish missionaries, were the model for the later Anglo-Saxon missionaries to Germany. The historian R. A. Markus suggests that the Gregorian mission was a turning point in papal missionary strategy, marking the beginnings of a policy of persuasion rather than coercion.|$|E
5|$|Although the Achaean League {{had been}} {{fighting}} Macedonia for decades, Aratus sent an embassy to Antigonus III in 226 BC seeking an unexpected alliance now that the reformist king Cleomenes III of Sparta was threatening the rest of Greece in the Cleomenean War (229–222 BC). In exchange for military aid, Antigonus III demanded the return of Corinth to Macedonian control, which Aratus finally agreed to in 225 BC. Antigonus III's first move against Sparta was to capture Arcadia {{in the spring of}} 224 BC. After reforming a Hellenic league in the <b>same</b> <b>vein</b> as Philip II's League of Corinth and hiring Illyrian mercenaries for additional support, Antigonus III managed to defeat Sparta at the Battle of Sellasia in 222 BC. For the first time in Sparta's history, their city was then occupied by a foreign power, restoring Macedonia's position as the leading power in Greece. Antigonus died a year later, perhaps from tuberculosis, leaving behind a strong Hellenistic kingdom for his successor Philip V.|$|E
5000|$|... "Paranormalized" [...] {{was a quick}} {{follow-up}} to [...] "Severe Exposure", and while it continued in the <b>same</b> sonic <b>vein,</b> the album was decidedly less guitar focused, with more emphasis on layered synthesizers. The touring for this record was much more effective as the band played with Shellac, The Jesus Lizard, and Trans Am {{and was on the}} road for most of that year. A few of the songs became live set staples ("Slave Traitor", [...] "The Greatest Hit").|$|R
50|$|Staines, a {{commuter}} {{town to the}} west of London, is completely different from the inner city ghetto that Ali G claims. In the <b>same</b> comic <b>vein,</b> he also makes reference to other similar stockbroker belt towns in the area, such as Egham, Langley and Englefield Green. Despite the incongruous nature of his hometown, he purports to exemplify inner city culture. Ali's full name is later revealed to be Alistair Leslie Graham (revealed in the eponymous film).|$|R

She decided that her next release should be an inspirational/contemporary Christian music record. The ensuing album, Atmosphere of Heaven, was released on March 7, 2006 on the independent label JoyfulChild, which was formed by Jerkins and Enriquez.|$|R

5|$|Events {{under the}} Ski Flying World Cup have several {{differences}} to the Ski Flying World Championships. The latter is an isolated tournament, or one-off event, in the <b>same</b> <b>vein</b> as the Ski Jumping World Championships and Winter Olympics, whereas the Ski Flying World Cup {{is part of}} the overall Ski Jumping World Cup season, and uses the same points system. These points contribute towards both Ski Flying and Ski Jumping World Cup standings; the former being effectively a 'mini season' within the latter. However, a feature shared with the Ski Flying World Championships is that the starting order switches over from the Ski Jumping World Cup standings to the Ski Flying World Cup standings after the first competition of the latter, and remains that way for all subsequent events.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, RedOctane, {{a company}} {{specializing in the}} {{manufacture}} of unique game controllers, was inspired to create Guitar Hero based on RedOctane's experience creating hardware for Konami's Guitar Freaks arcade game. They enlisted Harmonix, who previously developed several music video games, for development assistance. The first game in the series was made on a budget of $1 million. The series became extremely successful, leading to the acquisition of RedOctane by Activision in 2007. Harmonix was acquired by MTV Games and went on to create the Rock Band series of music games in the <b>same</b> <b>vein</b> as Guitar Hero. Activision brought Neversoft (primarily known for their Tony Hawk series of skateboarding games) on board for future development duties. Additional companies, such as Budcat Creations and Vicarious Visions have assisted in the adaptation of the games for other systems.|$|E
