5|$|In 1934, Bennetts {{teamed with}} state {{botanist}} Charles Gardner {{to study the}} toxic effect of native plants species on sheep. Gardner would collect the plants and supply them fresh to Bennetts who would then feed them to the sheep. They confirmed 24 species of plants as being poisonous, most which were from the native pea genera Gastrolobium and Oxylobium. Based on this and later research, Gardner and Bennetts published The Toxic Plants of Western Australia in 1956. During 1935, investigations into the effects of castrating male lambs with either mechanical pincers compared to using a knife, both of these methods have since been replaced with rubber elastrator rings.

25|$|A {{study from}} 2013 {{provided}} brain imaging evidence that human responses to fear chemosignals may be gender-specific. Researchers collected alarm-induced sweat and exercise-induced sweat from donors extracted it, pooled it and {{presented it to}} 16 unrelated people undergoing functional brain MRI. While stress-induced sweat from males produced a comparably strong emotional response in both females and males, stress-induced sweat from females produced a markedly stronger arousal in women than in men. Statistical tests pinpointed this gender-specificity to the right amygdala and strongest in the superficial nuclei. Since no <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> found in the olfactory bulb, the response to female fear-induced signals is likely based on processing the meaning, i.e. on the emotional level, rather than the strength of chemosensory cues from each gender, i.e. the perceptual level.|$|E
500|$|The {{correlation}} between social class and BMI varies globally. A review in 1989 {{found that in}} developed countries women of a high social class {{were less likely to}} be obese. No <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> seen among men of different social classes. In the developing world, women, men, and children from high social classes had greater rates of obesity. An update of this review carried out in 2007 found the same relationships, but they were weaker. The decrease in strength of correlation was felt to be due to the effects of globalization. Among developed countries, levels of adult obesity, and percentage of teenage children who are overweight, are correlated with income inequality. [...] A similar relationship is seen among US states: more adults, even in higher social classes, are obese in more unequal states.|$|E

2500|$|In content, early black minstrelsy {{differed}} {{little from}} its white counterpart. As the white troupes drifted from plantation {{subjects in the}} mid-1870s however, black troupes placed a new emphasis on it. The addition of jubilee singing gave black minstrelsy a popularity boost as the black troupes were rightly {{believed to be the}} most authentic performers of such material. Other <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> that the black minstrels added religious themes to their shows while whites shied from them, and that the black companies commonly ended the first act of the show with a military high-stepping, brass band burlesque, a practice adopted after Callender's Minstrels used it in 1875 or 1876. Although black minstrelsy lent credence to racist ideals of blackness, many African-American minstrels worked to subtly alter these stereotypes and to poke fun at white society. One jubilee described heaven as a place [...] "where de white folks must let the darkeys be" [...] and they could not be [...] "bought and sold". In plantation material, aged black characters were rarely reunited with long-lost masters like they were in white minstrelsy.|$|E

Participants were all sixteen superintendents (100 percent of the female population) and sixteen selected male superintendents. Techniques for matching the population included controlling for the following: number of students served by the district, number of schools in the district, being appointed or elected to the superintendency, school board selection process, number of school board members, and geographical location. A thirty-three item survey, developed by the researcher, was used to collect the data for the study.
