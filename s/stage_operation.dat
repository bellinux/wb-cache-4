50|$|Stamping (also {{known as}} pressing) {{is the process}} of placing flat sheet metal in either blank or coil form into a {{stamping}} press where a tool and die surface forms the metal into a net shape.

This could be a single <b>stage</b> <b>operation</b> where every stroke of the press produces the desired form on the sheet metal part, or could occur through a series of stages. The process is usually carried out on sheet metal, but can also be used on other materials, such as polystyrene.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} {{curative}} effects of two surgical treatment methods for open angle glaucoma and cataract patients. METHODS: Totally 69 patients with primary open angle glaucoma and cataract {{were divided into}} two groups: group A and group B. Thirty-four patients(34 eyes) in group A underwent small incision non-phacoemulsification cataract surgery combined with trabeculectomy, just combined operations, 35 patients(35 eyes) in group B underwent small incision non-phacoemulsification cataract surgery beyond 6 mo after trabeculectomy, just two <b>stage</b> <b>operations.</b> Postoperative intraocular pressure at 1 wk and 3 mo, postoperative corrected visual acuity and filtering bleb at 3 mo were observed, and intraoperative and postoperative complications were compared. All the patients were followed up for 3 - 6 mo. RESULTS: All the visual acuity were increased compared with that before surgery in two groups, the difference was not statistically significant. All the intraocular pressure was controlled in two groups, the difference was not statistically significant, and the difference about the filtering bleb was neither statistically significant(P > 0. 05). There were no serious intraoperative and postoperative complications in two groups. CONCLUSION: The two <b>stage</b> <b>operations</b> and the combined operations both can control theintraocular pressure and improved visual acuity of open angle glaucoma and cataract.

40|$|The recent {{downturn}} in world sugar prices has placed even greater demands upon the Australian sugar industry {{to reduce the}} costs of sugar manufacture and increase the consistency of producing high quality sugar. One of the proposed approaches in increasing the consistency of very high quality sugar production and leveraging further avenues for cost saving is {{in the development of}} a computer based advisory system. This system is able to provide expert knowledge in the area of pan stage management and best practices in the absence of human experts. This thesis explores the design, key features and outcomes of a knowledge based supervisory support system (KBSSS) framework proposed specifically for providing cooperative decision support in the area of pan <b>stage</b> <b>operations</b> within a sugar mill. To demonstrate the viability of the proposed KBSSS framework a prototype system was develop ed in accordance with the proposed framework. The KBSSS utilises three core innovative system technologies that form the core components of the proposed KBSSS framework. These technologies are: 1) Dynamic industrial pan stage process models for identifying the dynamic relationships between sections of pan <b>stage</b> <b>operations</b> to allow for future forecasting of pan stage operating conditions, 2) Integration techniques for the merging of the developed pan stage process models into the hybrid fuzzy logic expert system rule base to provide localisation adjustment to match with local real world factory operational conditions, and 3) Explanatory capabilities to provide justification and support of system advice and recommendations. As a result of research and development carried out in this thesis, the KBSSS&# 039;s test results demonstrated in the thesis indicate the viability of the proposed KBSSS framework and highlight the forecasting capabilities of the developed system resulting in favourable outcomes compared to data from pan <b>stage</b> <b>operations.</b> As a result of the research undertaken in the thesis a prototype KBSSS, for pan <b>stage</b> <b>operations,</b> based upon the three core supporting intelligent system technologies reported in the thesis has been developed...|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{determine}} the major {{risk factors and}} abnormal videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) findings associated with aspiration in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC). Method Risk factors associated with aspiration were investigated retrospectively in 241 patients with HNC using medical records and pre-recorded VFSS. Age, gender, lesion location and stage, treatment factors, and swallowing stage abnormalities were included. Results Aspiration occurred in 50. 2 % of patients. A univariate analysis revealed that advanced age, increased duration from disease onset to VFSS, higher tumor stage, increased lymph node stage, increased American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) <b>stage,</b> <b>operation</b> history, chemotherapy history, and radiotherapy history {{were significantly associated with}} aspiration (p< 0. 05). Among them, advanced age, increase AJCC <b>stage,</b> <b>operation</b> history, and chemotherapy history were significantly associated with aspiration in the multivariate analysis (p< 0. 05). Delayed swallowing reflex and reduced elevation of the larynx were significantly associated with aspiration in the multivariate analysis (p< 0. 05). Conclusion The major risk factors associated with aspiration in patients with HNC were advanced age, higher AJCC <b>stage,</b> <b>operation</b> history, and chemotherapy history. A VFSS to evaluate aspiration is needed in patients with NHC who have these risk factors. Delayed swallowing reflex and reduced elevation of the larynx were majo...|$|E
