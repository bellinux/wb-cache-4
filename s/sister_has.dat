5|$|In the South Indian {{kingdom of}} Cholapuram Paalayam {{in the year}} 1771, Raja Mokkaiyappar and his queen, Rajamatha Bhavani Ammaiyar are desperate for a child, as all their {{previous}} twenty-two children have died at birth. Unknown to them, Bhavani's brother, Sangilimayan, {{who is also the}} Rajaguru (High priest), is {{responsible for the death of}} their children. Sangilimayan is shocked to see that his <b>sister</b> <b>has</b> given birth to twins. Before informing the king about the birth, he calls the palace astrologer, Chinnavadayaan, who predicts that the elder twin will be incapable of making decisions on his own while the younger one will be smarter. Sangilimayan orders the palace doctor, Kailasakaruppan, to kill the younger one, but Chinnavadayaan tells Sangilimayan that his actions would not be good for the kingdom. Instead, Sangilimayan orders the palace doctor to abandon the child in a nearby river. The elder child is named Pulikecei XXIII. Maragathavalli, Kailasakaruppan's childless wife, rescues the abandoned child from the river, and the couple decides to raise him as their own, naming him Ukraputhan.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the Skanda Purana which {{talks about}} harmony between Devasena and Valli, the Paripatal – part of Tamil Sangam {{literature}} – speaks about conflict, {{resulting in a}} battle between Devayanai's royal soldiers and Valli's hunter clan, which the latter win. Folk ecal (a folk poem, presented as a dialogue of two persons) tradition also talks about the mistrust and quarrel between the co-wives. In one version - where Devayanai is the elder sister of Valli, Valli tries to woo Murugan, before Devayanai's marriage. As per tradition, the elder <b>sister</b> <b>has</b> to be married off first. Infuriated, Devayanai curses Valli to be born in the forest in her next life, and the curse is then fulfilled when Valli is born as a huntress. In the Jayantipura Mahatmya, the details of which correspond to most of {{those found in the}} Skanda Purana tale, Devasena and Valli are married to Kartikeya from primal times. However, in this version, the god condemns Valli to be born on earth as punishment for mocking her sister Devayanai. The Thirumurugatrupadai from Sangam literature describes Murugan being accompanied by his chaste wife Devayanai and honoured by a procession of gods and rishis (sages).|$|E

When her mother is {{apparently}} murdered by D'Haran assassins, she sets out with her new friend, Sebastian, to start her life over.

Above all else, he esteems Emperor Jagang. In equal measure, he despises Richard Rahl, who he claims has brought on war with an invasion of the Old World after bringing down the Barriers separating the sections of the known world.|$|E

25|$|The Bene Gesserit {{develop their}} {{physical}} abilities {{as well as}} their mental abilities. A trained <b>Sister</b> <b>has</b> full control over each muscle in her body through training known as prana-bindu. This allows her to bend the last joint in her little toe while remaining otherwise motionless, bend and contort her body in ways that most would consider impossible, or put a remarkable amount of force behind a physical blow. The mental part of prana-bindu, or prana-nervature (prana stands for breath, bindu stands for musculature) is the precise control of the totality of nerves in the human body. In Dune, Reverend Mother Mohiam tests Paul with a nerve induction device ("the box") that causes the sensation of intense pain. Paul learns that he {{is not the only one}} to have tried it, but is perhaps specially resistant; this conversation points to a widespread use of it as a tool among the Bene Gesserit to measure self control, nerve control, and as Mohiam puts it, crisis and observation.|$|E
25|$|Sharon's sister, Yehudit (Dita) married Dr. Shmuel Mandel. In the 1950s, {{the couple}} {{permanently}} left Israel and {{emigrated to the}} United States. This caused a permanent rift in the family. Shmuel and Vera Scheinerman were greatly hurt by their daughter's choice to leave Israel. As a result, Vera Scheinerman willed {{only a small part}} of her estate to Dita, an act which enraged her. At one point, Dita decided to return to Israel, but after Vera was informed by the Israel Lands Administration that it would not be legally possible to split the family property between Ariel and Dita, and informed her that she would not be able to build a home there, Dita, believing she was being lied to, permanently cut her family in Israel off, and refused to attend the funerals of her mother and sister-in-law. She reestablished contact after Sharon's stroke. Sharon's <b>sister</b> <b>has</b> rarely been mentioned in biographies of him: he himself rarely acknowledged her and only mentioned her twice in his autobiography.|$|E
25|$|As a Big Daddy, {{the player}} can attempt to defeat other Big Daddies who are {{themselves}} escorting Little Sisters. Should the player succeed, {{they can then}} choose to either harvest or adopt the Little Sister. While adopted, the Little Sister can lead the player to corpses from whom she can extract more ADAM. While she does this, the player must defend her from splicer attacks and other foes. Once the Little <b>Sister</b> <b>has</b> collected enough ADAM, the player can then return her to an escape vent, where the player must choose to either rescue or harvest the Little Sister. Rescuing her gives the player a modest amount of ADAM but also the possibility of beneficial gifts later; harvesting her yields a large ADAM boost. ADAM can then be spent at Gatherer's Garden machines throughout Rapture to buy new plasmids, gene tonics, slots, or health/eve upgrades. Once the player has either rescued or harvested each of the Little Sisters on the level, the player will be attacked by a Big Sister. The Big Sister's agility and resourcefulness will task the player with a difficult fight before the player can proceed further in the game.|$|E
