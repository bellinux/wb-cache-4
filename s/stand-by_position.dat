40|$|As {{part of the}} 'KombiMasch' project {{funded by}} the BMBF (contract number: 02 PW 2145), the Fraunhofer IPT has {{developed}} a hybrid machi ne tool with two modular mountable laser processing units for laser hardening and laser cladding. As with conventional turning, millin g and drilling tools, both laser units can be exchanged via the standard HSK 63 chucking interface of a milling spindle. The <b>stand-by</b> <b>position</b> of the laser units is located outside of the machine tool's workspace. Therefore, {{the integration of the}} laser units does not {{have a negative effect on}} the conventional machining processes. © TEMA</a...|$|E

About a month later, on December 6, 2006, two detectives and a drug-detection dog approached the residence, while other officers of the Miami-Dade Police Department established perimeter positions around the residence, with agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in <b>stand-by</b> <b>positions</b> as backup units.|$|R
40|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} principles to perform shedding motion which are; cam mechanism, dobby controlled mechanism and jacquard controlled mechanism. A dobby mechanism {{consists of three}} main parts; drive mechanism, selection mechanism and mechanism for transferring motion to the frames. Rotary dobby mechanisms are being used in shedding process of high-speed weaving machines. In this paper, design and synthesis of a novel drive mechanism had been explained. The drive mechanism, which is used in this research, is an eight component lever-gear mechanism. The most important innovation is in the motion transmission mechanism on the main shaft of rotational dobby. It is known that main shaft in rotary dobby has dwell period in only one direction. The novel drive mechanism is designed to make equally timed, double <b>stand-by</b> <b>positioned</b> oscilational motion. After designing of the rotary dobby, the mechanisms are produced and montaged. It was confirmed that dobby run well and durably with all mechanism and shedding process is precisely carried out. The experimental values of dwell angles at {{the right and left}} dead-center positions are similar to theoretical values. Experimental results show that; if the drive mechanism and dobby is generated with advanced technology, it is possible to use it in dobby industry...|$|R
40|$|Maritime {{operations}} in the far north are not only challenging due to harsh weather conditions, but when engaging in Arctic operations, the remoteness of the area can also be troublesome. In such remote areas, one can no longer {{take advantage of the}} area emergency preparedness, where cooperation between geographical areas allows different operating companies to share emergency preparedness resources, such as joint stand-by vessels and SAR helicopters. The demands to emergency preparedness are commonly solved by having a dedicated <b>stand-by</b> vessel <b>positioned</b> close to the platform. The drawback is that chartering such a vessel is costly, and it could be economically beneficial to eliminate the need for this extra vessel. Thus, we want to investigate what oil spill response time can be achieved by utilizing the vessels of the operational fleet for emergency response, in order to remove the supplementary standby-vessel. This leads to the objective of this master s thesis: The objective of this thesis is to develop a simulation model that can evaluate the expected emergency response time of a given fleet composition, and thus serve as a decision support tool for strategical fleet sizing and operational planning. In this thesis we limit the investigated emergencies to oil spills. However, the developed model is also applicable to other emergencies, but may require some minor adjustments depending on the incident investigated. Furthermore, the oil spill is assumed to originate from the offshore installation, and for simplicity, this is chosen as the location of the oil spill. Lastly, it is assumed that the operation takes place in an area where no ice is present. The simulation model is developed in MATLAB as a discrete-event simulation model, and its function is to determine the fastest feasible response time in case of an emergency. That is, the fastest time one of the vessels of our fleet can arrive at the scene of emergency in order to provide the necessary aid.   The model is tested through a case study, where we seek to determine how the fleet response time changes by the number of vessels carrying oil spill response equipment onboard. Through the case study, it was shown that the developed simulation model can be utilized to evaluate different fleet compositions with regards to response time, which can help aid in the decision making when determining the fleet specifications with regards to both emergency preparedness and logistics planning. For an external reader that wish to utilize this model, it is recommended to include some operational limitations given by weather conditions, such as wave height, and also extend upon the relation between weather conditions and their effect on sailing times...|$|R
40|$|The {{background}} for this master’s thesis {{is the focus}} on bioenergy and biofuels at NMBU. This has, among others, resulted in a prototype of a small-scale biorefinery, which uses methanol and waste cooking oil to produce biodiesel. The purpose of this thesis {{is to develop a}} reactor system that serves as a platform for reactors to operate on and a technological alternative for a periodically on-site clean of catalysts. The purpose of the catalysts wash is to extend their lifetime, {{in order to make the}} reactor system and thereby the biorefinery more sustainable. The project started with research and literature review in the field of study. Solutions and alternatives were reviewed in an initial design within the concept specifications. Integrated Product Development and SCAMPER is used as methods for the concept development and creating technical alternatives and features. Pugh method has been used for the evaluation and selection of concept. The structure is optimized in a simple FEM structure analysis. Sketches and CAD are used to present the design in 2 D and 3 D drawings, and an environmental analysis and cost estimate of prototype and series production is completed. The final solution consists of a reactor system with two mounted reactors. Initially, one of them connected to the process of turning the reactants, oil and alcohol, to biodiesel product. The other reactor having its catalyst washed, changed or in other maintenance. When done, the reactor is on <b>stand-by</b> to switch <b>position</b> with the operational one. The position switch happens periodically, by a rotating platform driven and controlled by a motorized rotary stage. Before the rotation, the couplings for the tubes disconnect and when rotated 180 degrees, connects again, this time with the other reactor. Four linear actuators at each inlet and outlet of the reactors, is proposed as a coupling system for disengage and engage motion of the couplings. For further work, it is emphasized to finalize the coupling system, for the reactor system to be completely automatic. As of now the reactor system is depending on manual labor for this job. The structure consists of hollow squared profiles and two decks as housing, mountable with the rest of a biorefinery arrangement. Two types of chemical reactors are presented. Both are continuous packed bed reactors designed for 3 D printing, using mainly Polypropylene (PP) as material. The principle is the same for both reactors, using capsules to pack the heterogeneous catalysts for easier reactor and catalyst handling...|$|R
