Riegel addressed specific reasons she made the return. [...] "It was the storyline that got me excited," [...] she said. [...] "I always want to come back. I love All My Children, and they’re my family. I barely need an excuse -- it’s usually just about timing." [...] Riegel added that [...] "this time {{it was the fact that}} they were going to have Bianca in a committed relationship". She stated, [...] "It was very, very important to me, and I was so glad to hear that.

At last she had found sense in fractions. There {{was to be a}} series of convenient and spacious rooms on the ground floor, a refectory, which might be cleared and used for meetings--"dances," [...] said Lady Harman. [...] "Hardly the sort of thing we want 'em to get up to," [...] said Sir Isaac--various offices, the matron's apartments--"We ought to begin thinking about matrons," [...] said Sir Isaac;--a bureau, a reading-room and a library--"We can pick good, <b>serious</b> <b>stuff</b> for them," [...] said Sir Isaac, [...] "instead of their filling their heads with trash"--one or two workrooms with tables for cutting out and sewing; this last was an idea of Susan Burnet's. Upstairs there was to be a beehive of bedrooms, floor above floor, and each floor as low as the building regulations permitted. There were to be long dormitories with cubicles at three-and-sixpence a week--make your own beds--and separate rooms at prices ranging from four-and-sixpence to seven-and-sixpence. Every three cubicles and every bedroom had lavatory basins with hot and cold water; there were pull-out drawers under the beds and a built-in chest of drawers, a hanging cupboard, a looking-glass and a radiator in each cubicle, and each floor had a box-room. It was ship-shape.|$|E

Producer Mira Lesmana recalls what she had in mind: [...] "we set out to make a film for Indonesian families.

60|$|My mind {{began to}} wander {{from the story}} and not very relevantly to employ itself with the {{question}} of how far our experiences really affect our characters. I remembered having once classed certain temperaments as the stuff of tragedy, and others as the stuff of comedy, and of having found a greater cruelty in the sorrows which light natures undergo, as unfit and disproportionate for them. Disaster, I tacitly decided, was the fit lot of serious natures; when it befell the frivolous it was more than they ought to have been made to bear; it was not of their quality. Then by the mental zigzagging which all thinking is I thought of myself and whether I was of this make or that. If it was more creditable to be of <b>serious</b> <b>stuff</b> than frivolous, though I had no agency in choosing, I asked myself how I should be affected by the sight of certain things, like the common calamities reported every day in the papers which I had hitherto escaped seeing. By another zigzag I thought that I had never known a day so close and stifling and humid. I then reflected upon the comparative poverty of the French language, which I was told had only that one word for the condition we could call by half a dozen different names, as humid, moist, damp, sticky, reeking, sweltering, and so on. I supposed that a book of synonyms would give even more English adjectives; I thought of looking, but my book of synonyms was {{at the back of my}} table, and I would have to rise for it. Then I questioned whether the French language was so destitute of adjectives, after all; I preferred to doubt it rather than rise.|$|E

40|$|It {{has become}} a truism in {{national}} public policy discourse that Indigenous affairs are a classic ‘wicked’ problem. The issues and interests in scope are without question all-encompassing and include every level of the Australian federation, social/economic/environmental policy, debates about rights, responsibilities and welfare conditionality, cultural diversity, historical injustices, and geographical disparities from urban to remote communities (see Head 2008). <b>Serious</b> Whitefella <b>Stuff</b> by Mark Moran confronts the conundrum and inevitable complexity of Indigenous policy and shines a very practical light on the mixed results in policy delivery and program implementation. Importantly, Moran proposes doing something about this unsatisfactory reality. Six case studies relating to remote communities in Queensland and the Northern Territory provide the narrative and evidence base for this book. The policy and delivery issues covered are diverse and complex including alcohol management, the outstations movement, rebuilding local community culture, home ownership and sustainable housing, and local impacts of a ‘shared responsibilities’ agenda...|$|R

It's sad—they've turned black music into a club thing." [...] In the liner notes for Voodoo, Saul Williams examined the album's concept and echoes D'Angelo's dissatisfaction with the mainstream direction of contemporary R/soul and hip hop, noting a lack of artistic integrity in the two music genres. In an interview for Ebony, D'Angelo said of his role and influences for Voodoo, [...] "I consider myself very respectful of the masters who came before. In some ways, I feel a responsibility to continue and take the cue from what they were doing musically and vibe on it. That's what I want to do. But I want to do it for this time and this generation". In the album's EPK, D'Angelo said that Voodoo is [...] "like a funk album. The natural progression of soul, the next step to soul is funk".|$|R

[...] "It was weird to be 25 and sitting in a neurological ward and I'm surrounded by people who actually had brain tumors. It was very scary and it was my first proper look at mortality.

She said: [...] "I never thought I would hear myself say as much, but I'm with Mrs Whitehouse on this one. The liberal mood back in the '60s was that sex was pleasurable and wholesome and shouldn't be seen as dirty and wicked. The Pill allowed women to make choices for themselves. Of course, that meant the risk of making the wrong choice. But we all hoped girls would grow to handle the new freedoms wisely. Then everything came to be about money: so now sex is about money, too. Why else sexualise the clothes of little girls, run TV channels of naked wives, have sex magazines edging out the <b>serious</b> <b>stuff</b> on newsagents' shelves? It's money that's corrupted us and women are being used and are even collaborating." ...|$|E

5000|$|Although many of Yankovic's {{songs are}} parodies of {{contemporary}} radio hits, {{it is rare}} that the song's primary topic lampoons the original artist as a person, or the song itself. Most Yankovic songs consist of the original song's music, with a separate, unrelated set of amusing lyrics. Yankovic's humor normally lies more in creating unexpected incongruity between an artist's image and {{the topic of the}} song, contrasting the style of the song with its content (such as the songs [...] "Amish Paradise", [...] "White & Nerdy", and [...] "You're Pitiful"), or in pointing out trends or works which have become pop culture clichés (such as [...] "eBay" [...] and [...] "Don't Download This Song"). Yankovic's parodies are often satirical of popular culture, including television (see The TV Album), movies ("The Saga Begins"), and food (see The Food Album).

While certain band members have left to pursue what was perceived to be a more lucrative rock music career, Donnie Walsh has a different perspective: [...] "Just around when I started here were all these guys in blues bands and of course they were impatient and they wanted to make some more money so they became rock bands. I played the blues then and I play the blues now. That's what I love. ... It's a living thing, it's living music.
