5|$|After {{operating}} {{only during}} peak hours {{for more than}} 30years, the closure announcement came on 4 January 1993. The original 1907 lifts at Aldwych required replacement {{at a cost of}} £3million. This was not justifiable as only 450 passengers used the station each day and it was losing London Regional Transport £150,000 per year. The Secretary of State for Transport granted permission on 1 September 1994 to close the <b>station</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> branch closed on 30 September.|$|E
5|$|All {{communication}} from mobile terminals {{to the base}} stations is encrypted with a key known only to the base <b>station</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> terminal. For group conversations, two keys are used, one from the terminal to the base station, and one from the base station to all users. In addition, there are 32 fixed keys used for terminal-to-terminal communication should the base station fall out. In addition, the police can use a user-to-user encryption where the communication is encrypted {{all the way through}} the network from the one user to the other.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{being set}} in Yorkshire, the {{majority}} of location filming was moved to Buckinghamshire, although Levisham railway <b>station</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> surrounding area in North Yorkshire were used. The location shooting of the film began on 18 August 1986, at St. Mary's church in Radnage. Filming was periodically hindered by inclement weather – the perfect summer in which the book was set was not forthcoming, and scenes were filmed during breaks in heavy rain. Interiors were shot at Bray Studios in Berkshire.|$|E

30|$|Centrality of stations: The {{centrality}} {{for each}} station {{can be determined}} through spatial network analysis. For this, the number of adjacent <b>stations</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mean network distance is calculated. With this approach, poorly connected stations, which do not efficiently contribute to the network can be easily identified. <b>The</b> centrality of <b>stations</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> connectivity of the network are crucially important factors for the future redistribution effort.|$|R
5|$|Disused {{parts of}} the <b>station</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> running tunnels were used during both world wars to shelter artworks from London's public {{galleries}} and museums from bombing.
