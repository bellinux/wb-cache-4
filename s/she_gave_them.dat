She found that, [...] "it isn't only human beings who have personality, who are capable of rational thought [...] emotions like joy and sorrow."

Goodall insists that these gestures are evidence of [...] "the close, supportive, affectionate bonds that develop between family members and other individuals within a community, which can persist throughout a life span of more than 50 years." [...] These findings suggest that similarities between humans and chimpanzees exist in more than genes alone, but can be seen in emotion, intelligence, and family and social relationships.|$|E
