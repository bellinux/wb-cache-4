60|$|I {{have said}} that the {{correspondence}} circulating in the United States is less than that of the United Kingdom. In making any comparison between them, I am obliged to arrive at facts, or rather at the probabilities of facts, in a somewhat circuitous mode, as the Americans have kept no account of the number of letters which pass through their post-offices in a year; we can, however, make an estimate, which, if incorrect, shall not at any rate be incorrect against them. The gross postal revenue of the United States for the year ended June 30th, 1861, was in round figures 1,700,000l. This was the amount actually cashed, exclusive of a sum of 140,000l. paid to the post-office by the government for the carriage of what is called in that country free mail matter; otherwise, books, letters, and parcels franked by members of Congress. The gross postal revenue of the United Kingdom was in the last year, in round figures, 3,358,000l., exclusive of a sum of 179,000l. claimed as earned for carrying official postage, and also exclusive of 127,866l., that being the amount of money order commissions, which in this country is considered a part of the post-office revenue. In the United States there is at present no money order office. In the United Kingdom the sum of 3,358,000l. was earned by the conveyance and delivery of 593,000,000 of letters, 73,000,000 of newspapers, 12,000,000 of books. What number of each was conveyed through the post in the United States we have no means of knowing; but presuming the average rate of postage on each letter in the States to be the same as it is in England, and presuming also that letters, newspapers, and books circulated in the same proportion there as they do with us, the sum above named of 1,700,000l. will have been earned by carrying about 300,000,000 of letters. But the average rate of postage in the States is in fact higher than it is in England. The ordinary <b>single</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>postage</b> there is three cents, or three half-pence, whereas with us it is a penny; and if three half-pence might be taken as the average rate in the United States, the number of letters would be reduced from 300,000,000 to 200,000,000 a year. There is, however, a class of letters which in the States are passed through the post-office at the rate of one half-penny a letter, whereas there is no rate of postage with us less than a penny. Taking these half-penny letters into consideration, I am disposed to regard the average rate of American postage at about five farthings, which would give the number of letters at 250,000,000. We shall at any rate be safe in saying that the number is considerably less than 300,000,000, and that it does not amount to half the number circulated with us. But the difference between our population and their population is not great. The population of the States during the year in question was about 27,000,000, exclusive of slaves, and that of the British Isles was about 29,000,000. No doubt in the year named the correspondence of the States had been somewhat disturbed by the rebellion; but that disturbance, up to the end of June, 1861, had been very trifling. The division of the Southern from the Northern States, as far as the post-office was concerned, did not take place till the end of May, l861; and therefore but one month in the year was affected by the actual secession of the South. The gross postal revenue of the States which have seceded was, for the year prior to secession, 1,200,500 dollars, and for that one month of June it would therefore have been a little over 100,000 dollars, or 20,000l. That sum may therefore be presumed to have been abstracted by secession from the gross annual revenue of the post-office. Trade, also, was no doubt injured by the disturbance in the country, and the circulation of letters was, as a matter of course, to some degree affected by this injury; but it seems that the gross revenue of 1861 was less than that of 1860 by only one thirty-sixth. I think, therefore, that we may say, making all allowance that can be fairly made, that the number of letters circulating in the United Kingdom is more than double that which circulates, or ever has circulated, in the United States.|$|E

30|$|We {{performed}} a decaying-source experiment {{to investigate the}} high count-rate performance of a PET-MR system (Siemens mMR) over the expected range of activities during a clinical study. We also performed imaging of a cardiac perfusion phantom, which provides an experimental simulation of clinical transit of a simultaneous radiotracer (phantom injected activities range 252 to 997  MBq) and gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA). Time-activity and time-intensity curves of the aorta and myocardium compartments from PET and MR images were determined, and quantification of perfusion was then performed using a standard cardiac kinetic model. The decaying-source experiment showed a maximum noise equivalent count <b>rate</b> (NECRmax) <b>of</b> 286  kcps at a <b>singles</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> 47.1  Mcps. NECR was maintained within 5 % (NECR 95 %) of the NECRmax with a <b>singles</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> 34.1  Mcps, corresponding to 310  MBq in the phantom. Count-rate performance was degraded above the <b>singles</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> 64.9  Mcps due {{to the number of}} detection events impacting the quantitative accuracy of reconstructed images. A 10 % bias in image activity concentration was observed between <b>singles</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> 78.2 and 82.9  Mcps.

30|$|In addition, {{in a power}} {{transmission}} network, the shed-load can be restored using a step-by-step restoration scheme that uses different restoration rates (MW/minute) or a continuous restoration scheme that uses a <b>single</b> restoration <b>rate.</b> Typically, most {{power transmission}} network loads are aggregated loads that represent distribution networks.

50|$|In the U.S., the use <b>of</b> <b>postage</b> stamps {{caught on}} quickly and became more {{widespread}} when on March 3, 1851, {{the last day}} of its legislative session, Congress passed the Act of March 3, 1851 (An Act to reduce and modify the <b>Rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>Postage</b> in the United States). Similarly introduced on {{the last day of}} the Congressional session four years later, the Act of March 3, 1855 required the prepayment <b>of</b> <b>postage</b> on all mailings. Thereafter, postage stamp use in the U.S. quickly doubled, and by 1861 had quadrupled. In 1856, under the direction of Postmaster General James Campbell, Toppan and Carpenter, (commissioned by the U.S. government to print U.S. postage stamps through the 1850s) purchased a rotary machine designed to separate stamps, patented in England in 1854 by William and Henry Bemrose, who were printers in Derby, England. The original machine cut slits into the paper rather than punching holes, but the machine was soon modified. The first stamp issue to be officially perforated, the 3-cent George Washington, was issued by the U.S. Post Office on February 24, 1857. Between 1857 and 1861 all stamps originally issued between 1851 and 1856 were reissued with perforations. Initial capacity was insufficient to perforate all stamps printed, thus perforated issues used between February and July 1857 are scarce and quite valuable.|$|R
30|$|This work {{describes}} the effect <b>of</b> high count <b>rates</b> on the quantification of cardiac perfusion using standardized experimental simulations in an mMR PET-MR system. We have shown with a decaying-source experiment that above a total <b>singles</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> approximately 64.9  Mcps (specific for our setup), data {{is subject to}} increasing levels of count loss. A distinct change is observed in the scanner response at 64.9  Mcps (Fig.  1). This point also corresponds {{to a change in}} recovered activity concentration, showing that at <b>singles</b> <b>rates</b> above 64.9  Mcps, quantification of images begin to be affected by count losses. For this phantom setup, a 5 % reduction in NECR (NECR 95 %) can be achieved with a <b>singles</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> 34.1  Mcps and a 10 % reduction in NECR with 24.7  Mcps. Figure  2 details that a 10 % bias in image activity concentration is reached in the reconstructed images between <b>singles</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> 78.2 and 82.9  Mcps; however, bias in the images can be avoided at <b>singles</b> <b>rates</b> lower than 60  Mcps. Response in the image activity concentration in PET-CT systems typically shows an exponential increase with decreasing activity rather than a sharp change at a single activity point as observed in this work, the cause of which {{may be related to the}} avalanche photo-diode detection system on the PET-MR system rather than photomultiplier tubes on traditional PET-CT systems. We opted to choose this water-filled torso phantom with cardiac insert in order to provide a more realistic geometrical setup for scatter and tracer distribution, rather than the standard NEMA phantom used during standardized performance testing of the system. Typical NEMA measurements do not include scanner performance as a result of a bolus of a high activity radiotracer.|$|R

40|$|The <b>single</b> <b>rate</b> codon model <b>of</b> non-synonymous {{substitution}} is {{ubiquitous in}} phylogenetic modeling.

Although the <b>single</b> <b>rate</b> model has achieved wide acceptance, we argue that the assumption <b>of</b> a <b>single</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> non-synonymous substitution is biologically unreasonable, given observed differences in substitution rates evident from empirical amino acid models. Some have attempted to incorporate amino acid substitution biases into models of codon evolution and have shown improved model performance versus the <b>single</b> <b>rate</b> model.

Rather, we should strive to both improve on the <b>single</b> <b>rate</b> model and to approximate the general time-reversible model of codon substitution, with as few parameters as possible, so as to reduce model over-fitting.
