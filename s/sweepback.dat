25|$|The three-spar wings {{were the}} most {{significant}} new feature on the Yak-1000. Small and rhomboid-shaped, they had an aspect ratio of only 1.46 with 60° leading-edge <b>sweepback</b> with 51°11' <b>sweepback</b> at quarter chord. The thickness/chord ratio was a remarkable 3.4% at the root and 4.5% at the tip. Skin was 1.5mm thick Duralumin. The trailing edge was swept forward 11° and consisted of a full-span flap with inset ailerons.|$|E

25|$|Like the Tupolev Tu-134, the Tu-154 has a wing {{swept back}} at 35° at the quarter-chord line. The British Hawker Siddeley Trident {{has the same}} <b>sweepback</b> angle, while the Boeing 727 has a {{slightly}} smaller <b>sweepback</b> angle of 32°. The wing also has anhedral (downward sweep) which is a distinguishing feature of Russian low-wing airliners designed during this era. Most Western low-wing airliners such as the contemporary Boeing 727 have dihedral (upward sweep). The anhedral means that Russian airliners have poor lateral stability compared to their Western counterparts, but also have weaker Dutch roll tendencies.|$|E
25|$|These changes did {{not solve}} the aircraft's {{handling}} problems, and the <b>sweepback</b> of the wings was reduced, which did resolve the handling problems. The Kestrel engines proved unreliable, and were replaced by more powerful Bristol Pegasus radial engines. In this form, the aircraft was designated the Vickers Type 195 Vanox, and was demonstrated {{to meet the requirements}} of specification.|$|E
25|$|The F/A-18 is a twin engine, mid wing, {{multi-mission}} tactical aircraft. It {{is highly}} maneuverable, owing to its good thrust to weight ratio, digital fly-by-wire control system, and leading-edge extensions (LEX). The LEX allow the Hornet to remain controllable at high angles of attack. The trapezoidal wing has a 20-degree <b>sweepback</b> {{on the leading}} edge and a straight trailing edge. The wing has full-span leading-edge flaps and the trailing edge has single-slotted flaps and ailerons over the entire span.|$|E
25|$|The F-15 has an {{all-metal}} semi-monocoque fuselage {{with a large}} cantilever shoulder-mounted wing. The wing planform of the F-15 {{suggests a}} modified cropped delta shape with a leading-edge <b>sweepback</b> angle of 45°. Ailerons and a simple high-lift flap are located on the trailing edge. No leading-edge maneuvering flaps are utilized. This complication was avoided by the combination of low wing loading and fixed leading-edge camber that varies with spanwise position along the wing. Airfoil thickness ratios vary from 6% at the root to 3% at the tip.|$|E
25|$|Design curiosities of the Tu-134 {{included}} a sharp wing <b>sweepback</b> of 35 degrees, compared to 25–28 degrees in its counterparts. The engines on early production Tu-134s lacked thrust reversers, {{which made the}} aircraft {{one of the few}} airliners to use a brake parachute for landing. The majority of onboard electronics operated on direct current. The lineage of early Soviet airliners could be traced directly to the Tupolev Tu-16 strategic bomber, and the Tu-134 carried over the glass nose for the navigator and the landing gear fitted with low-pressure tires to permit operation from unpaved airfields.|$|E
25|$|The Javelin was the RAF's first {{purpose-built}} all-weather interceptor aircraft. Aerodynamic {{features of}} the type included its adoption of the new delta wing and a large tailplane. Fuel and armaments were housed in the delta wing, while the engines and crew were contained within the fuselage. The delta wing and tailplane combination had been deemed necessary by Gloster for effective manoeuvrability at high speed and for the aircraft to be controllable at low landing speeds. In one instance during testing, when both elevators had been torn off by elevator flutter, the Javelin remained controllable {{in part due to}} the aerodynamic qualities of the large tailplane. Changes from the prototypes included alterations to the rear fuselage and lengthened engine jet exhausts, to eliminate buffeting of the rudder by the jet exhaust and increased <b>sweepback</b> of the wing's leading edge to improve high-speed handling.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, BAC Warton {{was working}} on the {{preliminary}} design of a two-seat Lightning development with a variable-geometry wing, based on the Lightning T.5. In addition to the variable-sweep wing, which was to <b>sweepback</b> between 25 degrees and 60 degrees, the proposed design featured an extended ventral pack for greater fuel capacity, an enlarged dorsal fin fairing, an arrestor hook, and a revised inward-retracting undercarriage. The aircraft was designed to be compatible with the Royal Navy's existing aircraft carriers carrier-based aircraft, the VG Lightning concept was revised into a land-based interceptor intended for the RAF the following year. Various alternative engines to the Avon were suggested, such as the newer Rolls-Royce Spey engine; it is also likely that the VG Lightning would have adopted a solid nose (by moving the air inlet to the sides or to upper fuselage) to install a larger, more capable radar.|$|E
25|$|Different sources {{claim the}} ARJ21 closely resembles either the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 or the MD-90 which were license-produced in China. Chinese {{factories}} producing parts for the MD-90 {{went on to}} produce the ARJ21 using tooling retained {{after the end of}} the MD-80/MD-90 licensed production program.. China claims that the ARJ21 is a completely indigenous design in spite of the fact that production drawings seen for the fuselage during development were simply McDonnell Douglas drawings with the identifying legend overlaid with a Chinese legend. The ARJ21's development did depend heavily on foreign suppliers, including engines and avionics from the United States. The ARJ21 features an all-new supercritical wing having a <b>sweepback</b> of 25degrees and designed by Ukraine’s Antonov Design Bureau. It is fitted with winglets to improve aerodynamic performance. Antonov also assisted the project with geometrical determination and integral analysis of the construction strength of ARJ21. Some of China's supercomputers have been used to design parts for ARJ21.|$|E
25|$|It wasn't until Dunne {{left the}} Balloon Factory and {{started his own}} company, the Blair Atholl Aeroplane Syndicate Ltd., that a {{monoplane}} could be built. The D.6 was finished in 1911, with a 60hp (45kW) Green in a pusher configuration. Three A-frames supported the wing engine, pilot and undercarriage. All Dunne's tailless aircraft had swept wings with marked washout (reduction of angle of incidence) at the tips. Since <b>sweepback</b> placed the tips well behind the centre of gravity, they provided longitudinal (pitch) stability in just {{the same way as}} a conventional tailplane, mounted at lower incidence than the wing. The wing camber increased outwards, causing the outer leading edge to droop further. The inherent design of the wing provided some directional (yaw) stability, which was augmented on the D.6 using down-turned wingtips. The wing had wingtip elevons for control, though because of the down-turned tips these also provided some rudder-like forces. The D.6 was tested at Larkhill on Salisbury Plain in January 1911 but failed to take off.|$|E

"At {{the time}} of the initial {{conception}} of the Short SB5 research aircraft (1949), it was recognised that the trend towards higher angles of <b>sweepback</b> was likely to continue, and this was emphasised by the existence of a design for an operational fighter aircraft, the English Electric P1 (Lightning), which was to have a <b>sweepback</b> of 60°. There was then no flight experience with wings of this amount of <b>sweepback.</b> The SB5 was designed to allow a gradual approach to this configuration, flying initially with 50° <b>sweepback</b> before conversion to 60° when it would resemble, aerodynamically, a seven-eighths scale model of the Lightning. To increase its usefulness as a research vehicle, the aircraft was capable of further modification to operate with 69° of wing sweepback." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Paresev 1A and 1B were unpowered; the [...] "fuselage" [...] {{was an open}} {{framework}} fabricated of welded SAE 4130 steel tubing, {{called a}} [...] "space frame". The keel and leading edges of the wing were constructed of [...] aluminium tubing. The leading edge <b>sweepback</b> angle was held at 50 degrees by a rigid spreader bar. Additional wing structure fabricated from steel tubing ensured structural integrity.|$|E
2500|$|The H.III {{series was}} an {{incremental}} {{development of the}} Horten H.II with reduced <b>sweepback</b> of 23°, span increased to 20 m (65ft 7 in) and modified lateral controls. [...] The wing trailing edges had three movable surfaces; the innermost was a landing flap, but the outer pair were geared differential elevons with the outer elevon having a large upward deflection and only slight downward movement, conversely, the inner elevon had large downward movement and slight upward movement.|$|E
2500|$|The Trident was a jet {{airliner}} of all-metal construction with a T-tail and a low-mounted wing with a quarter-chord <b>sweepback</b> of 35 degrees. It {{had three}} rear-mounted engines: two in side-fuselage pods, {{and the third}} in the fuselage tailcone, aspirating through an S-shaped duct. One version, the 3B, had a fourth [...] "boost" [...] engine aspirated through a separate intake duct above the main S-duct. All versions were powered by versions of the Rolls-Royce Spey, while the boost engine was also by Rolls-Royce: the RB.162, originally intended as a lift engine for VTOL applications.|$|E
2500|$|After World War I {{there were}} many surplus Airco DH.9 light bombers, {{designed}} by Geoffrey de Havilland, available for the emerging air transport business. [...] At first stripped DH.9s were used to carry one passenger behind the pilot in the gunner's position, but later versions, designated DH.9B, added a second passenger seat ahead of the pilot. [...] A second seat behind the pilot was added by extending the [...] rear cockpit in the early DH.9C. [...] Later DH.9Cs had this rear position converted to hold two passengers face to face, protected by a faired dorsal canopy or cabin. [...] Most of these later four-seat aircraft had slight <b>sweepback</b> to counter the rearward shift in the centre of gravity.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{experimental}} model, with a [...] antenna, {{was set up}} on {{the roof}} of the Radiation Lab. Although crude, it demonstrated that the basic idea was sound. A [...] version followed late in 1942, and then an [...] one with 108 dipoles in early 1943. It was pointed out that the dihedral and <b>sweepback</b> of most aircraft would make installation of an in-wing scanner difficult, and aeroelastic loads during flight, especially [...] "flapping", would be a serious concern. The team moved to a [...] long model with 252 dipoles, mounted in a separate streamlined wing-like enclosure. The width was limited to 16feet simply because that was the largest wood planer the team could access. Two dipoles were later removed at the request of an industrial partner who preferred to work with round numbers.|$|E
2500|$|The Sherwood Ranger is {{a single}} bay biplane, its wings having 3.83° of <b>sweepback,</b> 3° of {{dihedral}} on the lower wing alone but no stagger. They have constant chord and are of mixed construction, with single aluminium spars and drag struts, [...] plywood covered D-box leading edges, ply and spruce ribs and fabric covering. [...] There are externally interconnected Frise ailerons on both upper and lower wings. The latter are mounted on the lower fuselage longerons and single, faired, deep chord, I-shaped interplane struts position the upper wing well above the fuselage, assisted by central cabane struts. These latter struts, together with the wing centre section, {{are part of the}} tubular aluminium fuselage structure. [...] Additional bracing is provided by two flying wires and two landing wires on each side. The wings fold for transport.|$|E
2500|$|The HS.141 {{design was}} a jet {{airliner}} of all-metal construction with a T-tail and a low-mounted swept wing with a quarter-chord <b>sweepback</b> of 28degrees. The design featured two wing-mounted [...] "cruise" [...] engines and 16 lift fan engines mounted in sponsons {{either side of}} the fuselage (eight per side). The engines under main consideration were the Rolls-Royce RB.220 turbofan for forward propulsion and the Rolls-Royce RB.202, a high bypass ratio lift fan engine using technology developed for the Rolls-Royce RB.162 lift jet. Both engines were themselves design studies by Rolls-Royce and it was feared that there would be delays in their development due to the company's problems at the time. One new engine type also considered for main propulsion was the 'SNECMA M.56', which became the CFM International CFM56. Variations using fewer lift fan engines for STOL operations only were also studied as it was realised that the engines could account for 15% of the total weight of the aircraft and 35% of the final cost.|$|E
2500|$|The Orao II is a cantilever, {{shoulder}} wing monoplane chiefly built of wood with plywood and fabric covering {{but with a}} slightly forward swept light alloy spar. [...] It is a gull wing, with dihedral only on the inboard section where the leading edge {{is parallel to the}} spar and the trailing edge tapers towards it. [...] Over most of the wing the profile is Göttingen 549R, a revision of the much used Göttingen 549 airfoil, the R indicating a reflexed, camber reduced trailing edge. Outboard the leading edge also tapers towards the spar, giving it <b>sweepback,</b> ending in semi-elliptical tips. [...] The composite construction of the wing around the spar was completely new to sailplane construction; wooden extensions of the spar were bonded to it; wing ribs were riveted to the spa via metal brackets. According to Simons the wing and control surfaces were entirely plywood covered but Jane's All the World's Aircraft 1952-53 says that ply was only used ahead of the spar, with fabric covering aft.|$|E
2500|$|The TSR.38 was {{a fabric}} covered all metal machine with steel sparred wings with {{duralumin}} and steel ribs. It {{was a single}} bay biplane with staggered wings of almost equal span and sharp, 10° <b>sweepback.</b> [...] The airfoils were thick, the lower thicker and the upper wings carried leading edge automatic slots for low speed control. [...] The wings could be folded from the centre section for carrier stowage. The lower wing centre section had anhedral to allow a shorter undercarriage and also carried a pair of underwing radiators. [...] The undercarriage was of the fixed, split axle type required for torpedo launches, with torpedo crutches between the legs {{and there was a}} small, spatted tailwheel. [...] For carrier landing there was a hinged arrestor hook ending {{just in front of the}} tailwheel. The three crew sat in separate open cockpits, the pilot in front under a cut-out in the upper wing trailing edge, his navigator behind him and furthest aft the gunner with a Lewis gun on a Scarff ring. [...] The fin was large and rounded with a generous rudder, a little like that of the later Gladiator, with the tailplane braced from above to the fin.|$|E
2500|$|The {{immediate}} {{precursor of}} the Mistral-C Club Class glider was the Strauber Mistral high performance Standard Class aircraft designed by Manfred Strauber, Alois Fries, Hartmut Frommhold and Horst Gaber. [...] Design works began in January 1970 and the Mistral {{made its first}} flight in July 1975. [...] It {{was not intended to}} be serially produced. It was a 15.00m (49ft2.5in) span shoulder wing monoplane with a T-tail which made much use of glass reinforced plastic (GRP) in its structure. [...] The wings had an area of 9.40m² (101.2sqft), an aspect ratio of 23.9 and <b>sweepback</b> at one quarter chord of 0.4°. The dihedral was also 0.4°. The airfoil sections used were Wortmann FX-66-S-196 at the root and FX-66-S-161 at the tips. [...] The wings were constructed from GRP/balsa sandwich with ailerons of GRP and rigid, closed cell, polymethacrylimide (PMI) foam. [...] Aluminium Schempp-Hirth airbrakes extended from the upper wing surface only. The tail unit, with an all-moving tailplane, was also formed from PMI filled GRP. The fuselage of the Mistral was a pod and boom monocoque made from GRP/balsa sandwich, with the single seat cockpit under a single piece, framed canopy. [...] Its main, single landing wheel was manually retractable and assisted by a tailskid. The Mistral had a best glide angle of 39:1 and a minimum sink speed of 0.6m/s (118ft/mim).|$|E
2500|$|While its {{performance}} and design were exceptional and appreciated, {{it was never}} easy to fly. This {{was caused by the}} 60° leading edge <b>sweepback</b> of its wing and was inherent in these types of delta wing platforms. It required a much higher angle of attack than a conventional aircraft, up to 9.4° at Mach 0.5 at low altitudes. If the angle of attack was too high, in excess of 17°, the bomber could pitch up and enter a spin. Several factors could prevent a successful recovery: if the pilot applied elevon, if the center of gravity was not correctly positioned, or if the spin occurred below , recovery might not be possible. The B-58 also had stall characteristics that were not conventional. If the nose was elevated, the bomber maintained forward motion without pitching down. Unless large amounts of power were applied, the descent rate increased rapidly. Another problem pilots faced was called [...] "fuel stacking" [...] and took place when the B-58 accelerated or decelerated. It was due to fuel moving in the tanks and causing sudden changes in the center of gravity. This could cause the aircraft to pitch or bank and subsequently lose control. The B-58 was very difficult to safely recover from the loss of an engine at supersonic cruise due to differential thrust.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{designed}} to meet Air Ministry specification C.16/28, which required the ability to carry 30 troops and their equipment for 1,200 miles (1,930km) and was the same specification that produced the Handley Page H.P.43 and the Vickers Type 163. [...] The TC.33 was a large single bay biplane with no stagger and 7° <b>sweepback.</b> [...] Both wings had metal lattice spars and metal ribs with fabric covering. [...] The lower wing was unusual in that its centre section had marked anhedral so that the main spars met {{at the top of}} the fuselage, leaving the interior unobstructed. A similar arrangement, though with less anhedral was used by the slightly earlier Handley Page H.P.42 airliner. The outer end of this centre section was strut braced to the lower fuselage. The TC.33 was also unusual in having a lower wing of (slightly) greater span than the upper; most unequal span wings had a larger upper wing. The four evaporatively cooled Rolls-Royce Kestrel engines were mounted in two nacelles, each containing a tractor-pusher pair together with their steam condenser and mounted between the wings at the end of the centre section. They were each carried by two vertical struts above the nacelle, complicated strutting below and by further strutting to the lower wing roots. The wide (22ft 6 in (6.8 m)) split axle undercarriage had vertical legs from the front wing spar at the same point and bracing from the axles to the fuselage.|$|E
2500|$|The JetStar has {{a fairly}} typical {{business}} jet design layout, with a swept wing and a cruciform tail. The wing has a 30° <b>sweepback</b> and features large fuel tanks at about half-span, extending some distance {{in front and}} behind the wing. [...] The wings hold 10,000 pounds of fuel, and each slipper tank holds 4,000 pounds of fuel for a total fuel load of 18,000 pounds. [...] The wing also includes leading edge flaps (not slats) along {{the front of the}} wing outboard of the tanks (these leading edge flaps reduce the stalling speed by an additional three knots), while double-slotted trailing edge flaps span the entire rear surface inboard of the ailerons. [...] The wing incorporates inflatable rubber deicing boots for the removal of accumulated inflight ice. The horizontal stabilizer is mounted nearly halfway up the fin to keep it clear of the engines' jet blast. One feature is that the horizontal stabilizer is trimmable by pivoting the entire tail fin and stabilizer assembly, which has a distinctive unpainted area {{at the base of the}} fin that is noticeable in most pictures. The JetStar does not have any tail deicing capability, nor was it required for certification. [...] A speed brake is located on the underside of the fuselage to aid deceleration for landing. The original prototypes used a tricycle landing gear with one wheel per leg, but after an accident in 1962 the nose gear was modified with two tires.|$|E
2500|$|The F-111K was to {{be based}} around the {{airframe}} of the original F-111A version built for the U.S. Air Force, but was to feature a number of alterations and adaptations. Structurally, the aircraft {{would be similar to}} F-111A with the heavy duty undercarriage from the strategic bomber version. This allowed for a greater gross weight to be designed into the aircraft. The other major design change from the F-111A was in its avionics, with the design calling for the Mark II package developed for the F-111D version, which featured a new inertial navigation and attack system, incorporating the Rockwell International AN/APQ-130 attack radar, an IBM on-board computer, the Marconi AN/APN-189 doppler navigation radar and the Sperry Corporation AN/APQ-128 terrain following radar. The plan was then to pair this avionics package with British designed and developed mission systems, of which the main elements were the reconnaissance capability and weapon carriage. The F-111K was to feature a revised weapons bay, containing a new removable centreline weapons pylon, which was beneficial given the design of the underwing pylons – the F-111 had four stations under each wing, but only the inner pair were designed to pivot, meaning that the outer pair could not be used with the wings in full <b>sweepback</b> mode. All of the weapon pylons featured British designed ejector rack units. The aircraft was given provision for a pallet inside the weapons bay that would feature a British designed reconnaissance system, with three camera windows located next to the nosewheel undercarriage (which the US versions were not fitted with). The aircraft was designed with an aerial refuelling probe compatible with the [...] "probe and drogue" [...] system used by the RAF, similar to the one fitted to the F-111B, although mounted differently.|$|E
