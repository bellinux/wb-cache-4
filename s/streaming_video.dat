40|$|Abstract- In {{this paper}} we explore the {{possibilities}} of using existing IEEE 802. 11 b and 802. 11 g networks to <b>stream</b> <b>video</b> content. The objective is to evaluate WiFi network {{as a mean to}} transport video services. Experiment performed on a private network show some issues that manifest as breaks in transmission and unstable throughput and quality of a <b>streamed</b> <b>video.</b> Also, we discuss several other factors that can have effect on a quality of a <b>video</b> <b>stream.</b> We conclude that WiFi networks can be used to <b>stream</b> <b>video</b> content with recommendation to use point-to-point connections and avoid access points that serve more clients to achieve maximal transmission quality...|$|R
5|$|Unlike {{with most}} {{magazine}} launches, Viz decided to allow retailers {{to return the}} first two issues. This gave retailers {{a chance to see}} how well the magazine would sell in markets where manga anthologies were an unknown. Retailers were also given a quantity of free samples, distributed 100,000 free samples at Comic Con, and another 100,000 were made available to its partner Suncoast. Cartoon Network began providing sample chapters and <b>streaming</b> <b>video</b> content to its Adult Swim website, along with prominent links to Shonen Jump's official site.|$|E
5|$|Episodes of {{the show}} are also {{available}} online for download: Amazon Video on Demand, iTunes Store and the Zune Marketplace offer episodes from all of seasons 1 through 8. In 2007, NBCUniversal (the show's distributor) and Apple Inc. (iTunes' owner) had a disagreement that temporarily kept the fourth season off iTunes. In {{a statement to the}} press, Apple claimed that NBCUniversal wanted to drive up the per-episode price to $4.99. In September 2008, it was reported that the issue between Apple and NBC had been resolved. Episodes can now also be purchased in HD on iTunes for $2.99. Recent episodes are available in <b>streaming</b> <b>video</b> on Fox's official House webpage and all 8 seasons are now on Netflix DVD.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, however, it was {{reported}} that the series' ratings were declining. The average number of viewers aged 2 to 11 watching SpongeBob at any given time dropped 29% in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to Nielsen. Wall Street Journal business writer John Jannarone suggested that the age of the series and oversaturation of the series might be contributing to the decline of the series' ratings, and might also be directly responsible for the decline in Nickelodeon's overall ratings. Media analyst Todd Juenger directly attributes the decline in Nickelodeon's ratings to the availability of <b>streaming</b> <b>video</b> content on services like Netflix, a provider of on-demand Internet streaming media.|$|E

5|$|By April 2008, Ezarik {{had largely}} reduced her lifecasting {{productions}} {{to a less}} frequent basis. She had resumed pursuit of her web designer and video editor career and was living in Carnegie. Her new equipment by Nokia enabled her to lifecast and produce <b>streaming</b> <b>video</b> live without a computer connection. She continued to make weekly appearances on her own iJustine website at www.ijustine.tv. Still a Carnegie resident at the time, Ezarik planned to be vacationing in North Carolina when the iPhone 3G was released in July 2008 and hoped to find an AT wireless store to upgrade while on vacation. That June, Ezarik was named by Intel and its PR firm Ogilvy & Mather to a 10-member social media strategy advisory board. In late 2008, she relocated her base of operation from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to Los Angeles, California.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Learning {{activity}} models continuously from <b>streaming</b> <b>videos</b> is {{an immensely}} important problem in video surveillance, video index-ing, etc. Most {{of the research}} on human activity recognition has mainly focused on learning a static model considering that all the training in-stances are labeled and present in advance, while in <b>streaming</b> <b>videos</b> new instances continuously arrive and are not labeled. In this work, we propose a continuous human activity learning framework from <b>streaming</b> <b>videos</b> by intricately tying together deep networks and active learning. This allows us to automatically select the most suitable features and to take the advantage of incoming unlabeled instances to improve the exist-ing model incrementally. Given the segmented activities from <b>streaming</b> <b>videos,</b> we learn features in an unsupervised manner using deep net-works and use active learning {{to reduce the amount of}} manual labeling of classes. We conduct rigorous experiments on four challenging human activity datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for learning human activity models continuously...|$|R

Crunchyroll would stream English-subtitled episodes for free one week after they had aired in Japan. Paying subscribers can watch new episodes an hour after they air in Japan. On January 8, 2009, Crunchyroll uploaded their first episode (episode 129) to the service. Alongside new episodes each week, Crunchyroll also uploads episodes {{from the beginning of}} the series. The anime is licensed in North America by Sentai Filmworks, with distribution from Section23 Films. Section23 Films' Chris Oarr commented that only the first two seasons were licensed, with an option on the rest. The first collection containing thirteen English-subtitled episodes was released on DVD, April 27, 2010. Only 49 episodes were released before the releases stalled. However, shortly after licensing the Gin Tama film, Sentai Filmworks announced that based on the film's performance, they would consider releasing more of the series in North America, possibly with an English dub. An English subtitled version of the series began airing on Shorts HD on July 12, 2015.
