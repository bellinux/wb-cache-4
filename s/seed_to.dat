5|$|Once {{the player}} grows the Star Plant to 2000 metres and returns a <b>seed</b> <b>to</b> M.O.M., the main {{objective}} is completed, and the player {{is given the}} choice of collecting eight more seeds. Completing this final objective unlocks a special suit that allows the player to jump twice as high, and finishes the game. Players are free to explore the world after completion.|$|E
5|$|Because B.brownii {{releases}} its seed {{in response}} to bushfire, {{it is important that}} fires occur at intervals that allow the plants to generate plenty of viable seed. The optimum fire interval is around 18 years. If fire occurs too frequently, plants are burned before reaching maturity or before they have produced sufficient <b>seed</b> <b>to</b> ensure regeneration of the population. This may cause populations to decline, or even local extinction. Too-infrequent fire also causes population decline, as more plants die of natural attrition without releasing their seed, resulting in seed wastage.|$|E
5|$|In {{their first}} season without Johnson, the team won 43 games {{to earn the}} eight seed in the Western Conference playoffs. The Lakers became the first eighth <b>seed</b> <b>to</b> win the opening two games on the road against a number one seed when they took a 2–0 lead versus Phoenix. They lost the next two games at home however, then game five in Phoenix in overtime. Following the season head coach Mike Dunleavy was fired.|$|E
25|$|Poppy {{seeds are}} less than a {{millimeter}} in length, kidney-shaped, and have a pitted surface. It takes 3,300 poppy <b>seeds</b> <b>to</b> make up a gram, and between 1 and 2million <b>seeds</b> <b>to</b> make up a pound. The primary flavor compound is 2-Pentylfuran.|$|R

5|$|The border clearers' {{task was}} aided unofficially by German civilians {{from both sides}} of the former border, who {{scavenged}} the installations for fencing, wire and blocks of concrete to use in home improvements. Much of the fence was sold to a West German scrap-metal company. Environmental groups undertook a programme of re-greening the border, planting new trees and sowing grass <b>seed</b> <b>to</b> fill in the clear-cut area along the line.|$|E
5|$|The square {{was once}} famous for feral pigeons and feeding {{them was a}} popular activity. Pigeons began {{flocking}} to the square before construction was completed and feed sellers became {{well known in the}} Victorian era. The desirability of the birds' presence was contentious: their droppings disfigured the stonework and the flock, estimated at its peak to be 35,000, was considered a health hazard. A stall seller, Bernie Rayner, infamously sold bird <b>seed</b> <b>to</b> tourists at inflated prices.|$|E
5|$|Wanting to seek help, Dinah stabs {{herself with}} the cruifix piece, {{allowing}} her to temporarily ascend into the afterlife. There, she encounters her mother, who gives her another mausoleum seed that Dinah takes back to the living world. Dinah uses the <b>seed</b> <b>to</b> revive everyone killed in the incident and her armor melts into coins that flow out of the fountain. But in the end, Dinah opts to remove the crucifix piece, killing her.|$|E
50|$|The sesame <b>seeds</b> used <b>to</b> make gomashio may {{be either}} tan or black in color. They are toasted before being {{mixed with the}} salt. Occasionally the salt is also toasted. The ratio of sesame <b>seeds</b> <b>to</b> salt varies {{according}} to taste and diet, generally ranging between 5:1 (5 parts sesame <b>seeds</b> <b>to</b> 1 part salt) and 15:1. Gomashio is often homemade, though it is also commercially available in glass or plastic containers.|$|R

5|$|Banksia spinulosa var.spinulosa was {{introduced}} into cultivation in the United Kingdom in 1788 by Joseph Banks who supplied <b>seed</b> <b>to</b> Kew, Cambridge Botanic Gardens and Woburn Abbey among others; var.collina followed in 1800 and var.cunninghamii in 1822. It has proven a highly ornamental and bird-attracting plant in cultivation. Southern and montane provenance forms are frost hardy. In general, all forms prefer sandy, well-drained soils with sunny aspect, though some local forms hailing from Wianamatta shales may tolerate heavier soils. It is resistant to dieback, like most eastern banksias. As it grows naturally on acid soils, Banksia spinulosa is particularly sensitive to iron deficiency. Known as chlorosis, it manifests as yellowing of new leaves with preservation of green veins, and {{occurs when the}} plant is grown in soils of higher pH. This can also happen where soil contains quantities of cement, either as landfill or building foundations, and can be treated with iron chelate or sulfate.|$|E
5|$|Each {{contestant}} had {{the same}} decision facing them as before, which was whether to attempt {{to answer the question}} or walk away with their pre-tournament total intact. Attempting the question and answering incorrectly incurred the same penalty as in regular play, with a reduction of their pre-tournament winnings to $25,000. If the question was answered correctly, the player that did so became the tournament leader. If another player after him/her answered correctly, that player assumed the lead and the previous leader kept their pre-tournament winnings. The highest remaining <b>seed</b> <b>to</b> have attempted and correctly answered their question {{at the end of the}} tournament on November 20, 2009 would be declared the winner and become the syndicated series' third millionaire.|$|E
5|$|In the 2010–11 season, the {{aforementioned}} 2010 Seahawks won the NFC West with a 7–9 record, hosting and defeating the 11–5 New Orleans Saints. Failing {{to make the}} playoffs were the New York Giants and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, both with 10–6 records, due to losing tiebreakers for the sixth <b>seed</b> <b>to</b> the Green Bay Packers, who {{went on to become the}} first sixth-seeded team from the NFC to win the Super Bowl. The 2010 Seahawks were the first team in NFL history to win both a division championship and a playoff game with a losing regular season record. They currently have the lowest win percentage of any team to ever make the playoffs.|$|E

5|$|Leonardo's dissections and {{documentation}} of muscles, nerves, and vessels helped {{to describe the}} physiology and mechanics of movement. He attempted to identify the source of 'emotions' and their expression. He {{found it difficult to}} incorporate the prevailing system and theories of bodily humours, but eventually he abandoned these physiological explanations of bodily functions. He made the observations that humours were not located in cerebral spaces or ventricles. He documented that the humours were not contained in the heart or the liver, and that it was the heart that defined the circulatory system. He was the first to define atherosclerosis and liver cirrhosis. He created models of the cerebral ventricles with the use of melted wax and constructed a glass aorta to observe the circulation of blood through the aortic valve by using water and grass <b>seed</b> <b>to</b> watch flow patterns. Vesalius published his work on anatomy and physiology in De humani corporis fabrica in 1543.|$|E
5|$|Monsanto {{stated that}} he was {{infringing}} its patents because the soybeans he bought from the elevator were products that he purchased for use as seeds without a license from Monsanto; Bowman {{stated that he}} had not infringed due to patent exhaustion on the first sale of <b>seed</b> <b>to</b> whatever farmers had produced the crops that he bought from the elevator, on the grounds that for seed, all future generations are embodied in the first generation that was originally sold. Bowman had previously purchased and planted Monsanto seeds under a license agreement promising not to save seeds from the resulting crop, but that agreement was not relevant to his purchase of soybean seed from the grain elevator nor to the litigation. In 2007, Monsanto sued Bowman for patent infringement in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana.|$|E
5|$|The Big Ten entered seven {{teams in}} the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, ranging from Indiana making its 37th trip and earning a number one <b>seed</b> <b>to</b> Minnesota making its 8th {{appearance}} and earningn an eleven seed. The Big Ten became the first conference to send four teams to the Sweet Sixteen in back-to-back years since the 1997 and 1998 tournaments. Although it was the Big Ten's fifth time advancing four teams, {{it was the first}} time with consecutive occurrences. Entering Sweet Sixteen round with four strong contenders spread across four regions, there was talk of the conference matching or surpassing the 1985 Big East Conference performance with three final four entrants. Only Michigan advanced. Burke was named South Regional Tournament Most Outstanding Player. Michigan made its fourth appearance in the final four, giving the conference a total of 43 such appearances. Michigan was part of the highest attendance National Championship game to date with an attendance of 74,326.|$|E

5|$|The first {{exporter}} of palm seeds was Ned King, a mountain {{guide for the}} Fitzgerald surveys of 1869 and 1876, who sent <b>seed</b> <b>to</b> the Sydney Botanic Gardens. Overseas trade began in the 1880s when {{it was found that}} one of the four palms endemic to the island, kentia palm (Howea forsteriana), which grows naturally in the lowlands, was ideally suited to the fashionable conservatories of the well-to-do in Britain, Europe and the United States, but the assistance of mainland magistrate Frank Farnell was needed to put the business on a sound commercial footing when in 1906 he became Director of a company, the Lord Howe Island Kentia Palm Nursery, whose shareholders included 21 islanders and a Sydney-based seed company. However, the formation of the Lord Howe Island Board of Control was needed in 1913 to resolve outstanding issues.|$|E
5|$|Three months later, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) {{calls in}} Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and informs her that four African American {{men have been}} kidnapped in Philadelphia.
