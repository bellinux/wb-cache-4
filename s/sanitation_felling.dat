5000|$|Circa 1967, a new, {{far more}} virulent strain arrived in Britain on a {{shipment}} of rock elm U. thomasii logs from North America, and this strain proved both highly contagious and lethal to European elms; more than 25 million trees {{have died in the}} UK alone, while France has lost over 90% of its elms. The disease is still migrating northwards through Scotland, reaching Edinburgh in the late 1970s, and Inverness in 2006. By 1990, very few mature elms were left in Britain or much of continental Europe. One of the most distinctive English countryside trees (See John Constable's painting Salisbury Cathedral from the South-West), the English elm U. procera Salisb., is particularly susceptible. Thirty years after the outbreak of the epidemic, nearly all these trees, which often grew to more than 45 m high, are gone. The species still survives in hedgerows, as the roots are not killed and send up root sprouts ("suckers"). These suckers rarely reach more than 5 m tall before succumbing to a new attack of the fungus. However, established hedges kept low by clipping have remained apparently healthy throughout the nearly 40 years since the onset of the disease in the UK.The largest concentrations of mature elms in Europe are now in Amsterdam and The Hague. In 2005, Amsterdam was declared the [...] "Elm City of Europe": the city’s streets and canals are lined with at least 75,000 elms, including several generations of research-elms (see below: Resistant trees). Some 30,000 of the 100,000 mature trees in The Hague are elms, planted because of their tolerance of salty sea-winds. Since the 1990s, a programme of antifungal injections of the most prominent 10,000 elms, and of <b>sanitation</b> <b>felling,</b> has reduced annual elm losses in The Hague from 7% to less than 1% (see below: Preventive treatment). The losses are made up by the planting of disease-resistant cultivars. The largest concentration of mature elm trees remaining in England is in Brighton and Hove, East Sussex, where of the 30,000 elms in 1983 15,000 still stand (2005 figures), several of which are estimated to be over 400 years old. Their survival is owing to the isolation of the area, between the English Channel and the South Downs, and the assiduous efforts of local authorities to identify and remove infected sections of trees immediately when they show symptoms of the disease. Empowered by the Dutch Elm Disease (Local Authorities) (Amendment) Order 1988, local authorities may order the destruction of any infected trees or timber, although in practice they usually do it themselves, successfully reducing the numbers of elm bark beetle Scolytus spp., the vector of elm disease. Sanitary felling has also, to date, preserved most of the 250,000 elms on the Isle of Man, where average temperature and wind speed inhibit the activity of the beetles, which need a temperature of at least 20 degrees to fly and a wind speed of less than five metres per second. [...] The largest concentration of mature elms in Scotland is in Edinburgh, where over 5000 remained in 2009 from some 35,000 in 1976. The city council gives the overall number of elms as 15,000 (2016). Edinburgh's Leith Links and Meadows have some of the highest concentrations of mature elms among U.K. parks (2014). A policy of sanitary felling has kept losses in the city to an average of 1000 a year. Elm was the most common tree in Paris from the 17th century; before the 1970s there were some 30,000 ormes parisiens. Today, only 1000 mature elms survive in the city, including examples in the large avenues (Avenue d'Italie, Avenue de Choisy, Boulevard Lefebvre, Boulevard de Grenelle, Boulevard Garibaldi) and two very old specimens, one in the garden of the Tuileries in front of the l'Orangerie and another in the Place Saint-Gervais in front of l'hôtel de ville de Paris. Losses are now being made up with disease-resistant cultivars, especially the Dutch-French research elm 'Nanguen' (...) , named after the city.|$|E

Using a cross-correlation function between the time series, an increase in the abundance of I. typographus due to windfall was demonstrated with a delay of 1 – 3 years.

The stands belong to the most common types of hygrophile and mesophile pedunculate oak forests in the area of Flat Srem. The measurements of stem diameters, tree heights and the assessment of damage to trees were performed in 1994 and 2011. In 1994, the percentage of dead and severely damaged trees on the sample plots amounted to 28 % and 40 %, and in 2011 the share of se­verely damaged trees accounted for 19 % and 22 %. During the sanitation fellings in the period 1994 - 2011 the average annual harvested volume of damaged and dead trees was 1. 85 and 1. 59 times higher than the current increment of the remaining trees in that period. In 1994 the percentage of dead and severely damaged trees in the structure of sanitary felling ranged from 62 to 88 %.

40|$|In {{the last}} years, many Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) stands have been {{severely}} {{attacked by the}} bark beetle Ips acuminatus (Coleoptera Curculionidae Scolytinae). In the outbreak area of San Vito di Cadore (Eastern Dolomites), the number of attacked trees since 2005 and both the emergence of bark beetles and natural enemies have been assessed. The investigated forests showed dozens of easily recognizable infestation spots with size ranging from about 20 - 30 trees (small spots) up to 300 trees (large spots). These infested spots evolved quickly, while new ones appeared within a radius of few hundreds of meters. During the last 5 years (2006 - 2010) we sampled branches from small and large spots and lodged them into emergence cages: adults of I. acuminatus as well as natural enemies were collected weekly, identified and counted. At the same time, a monitoring program of the surveyed pine stands was carried out to check the enlargement of old spots {{and the appearance of}} new ones. Voltinism and phenology of I. acuminatus were investigated by pheromone traps baited with different lures (Austrian vs. Spanish lures). The effects of a <b>sanitation</b> <b>felling</b> of about 4500 infested trees, carried out by the Regional Forest Service in autumn 2007 on I. acuminatus population were also assessed. Throughout the whole sampling area I. acuminatus resulted bivoltine, with the highest density attained during the first generation. However, a part of the population still evidenced a monovoltine behaviour. The realized <b>sanitation</b> <b>felling</b> strongly reduced both breeding sites and the number of infested trees observed during the following year. Moreover the pheromone-baited traps gave useful information about changes in bark beetle population density; the trapping efficiency of Spanish lure resulted clearly higher than the Austrian one. Finally, the recorded parasitism may have a role in outbreak dynamics as it was significantly higher during the second host generation, in both small and large spots...|$|E
40|$|The major {{bark beetle}} threat to Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) in Eurasia is the {{spruce bark beetle}} Ips typographus. Beetles cause damage after {{population}} build-up in defenseless trees. To minimize attacks, timely removal of these trees is important. This is practiced by clearing of wind throws and <b>sanitation</b> <b>felling.</b> Thus, knowledge about the region-specific flight pattern and voltinism of I. typographus is necessary for efficient pest management. This thesis focuses on the flight initiation and the variation in flight pattern of I. typographus over the season, which we have studied using pheromone traps during a seven year period in Sweden.

40|$|Several adverse {{factors of}} abiotic and biotic nature affect the {{vitality}} and decline of spruce and fir {{in the region}} of NP "Durmitor" and NP "Biogradska Gora". The most significant adverse abiotic factor is air pollution. Among the adverse biotic factors, the most significant is by all means the parasitic fungus Heterobasidion annosum. The damage caused by this fungus is especially severe in spruce and fir stands {{in the region of}} the NP "Durmitor". The infection intensity is approximately the same in both species. The damage caused by H. annosum is greater in the forests of NP "Durmitor", than in the forests of NP "Biogradska Gora". This {{can be explained by the}} fact that spruce and fir stands on Durmitor were felled without maintaining the forest order. In the virgin forest reserve NP "Biogradska Gora" in the past there were no fellings, i. e. the impact of anthropogenic factors was excluded. Fungus H. annosum cannot be eliminated form spruce and fir stands on Durmitor, but the treatment of stumps (immediately after the <b>sanitation</b> <b>felling)</b> with "Penofil" or "Borax" can check the velocity of its spread. In this way, the forest is given an opportunity to form more resistant populations through a long period by natural selection...|$|E
40|$|The eight toothed spruce {{bark beetle}} (Ips typographus) plays an {{important}} role in spruce forests of Croatia, in the same way as it does in the rest of Europe wherever spruce grows. The size and intensity of its outbreaks is considerably lower though, and compared with the majority of countries scoring huge timber losses, Croatian forestry in general is much less affected, both economically and ecologically, by this bark beetle. Mixed tree species composition, natural origin and uneven age structure of spruce stands surely adds to the less pronounced and sporadic outbreaks in the Croatian territory. The recent rise of bark beetle populations in general, and above than average attacks of this bark beetle in the central parts of Dinaric mountain chain, initiated some new, targeted research projects. In the northern part of the Velebit Mountain, in the spring of 2008, a field trial was set up aimed at investigating the overwintering strategy of the eight toothed {{spruce bark beetle}} on two experimental plots in different elevation zones. The core idea was to test the already described phenomenon of different hibernation niche choice within the northern dwelling populations (predominantly choosing forest litter) and southern populations (staying within their growing niche, under the spruce bark). The general objective of the research and the expected outcomes fall within the area of <b>sanitation</b> <b>felling</b> and mechanical procedures in a wider concept of integrated bark beetle suppression tactics that could be used by Croatian foresters. Each experimental plot was characterized by the freshly attacked group of spruce trees (last summer – second generation of spruce bark beetle). The aerial distance between the lower »Štirovača« plot (1080 meters a. s. l.) and the higher »Zavižan» plot (1404 meters a. s. l.) was 17. 5 kilometers ensuring that the two were well separated in space. The altitudinal difference of 324 meters might not seem striking but climatic conditions in the area of experimental plots are quite different, notably in terms of temperature profile and height and duration of snow cover. On each experimental plot a set of forest floor eclectors was set up within the vicinity of standing spruces hit by the last summer bark beetle attack. Also, on each of the plots, one tree–mounted cylindrical eclector was wrapped around the lower tree trunk of a standing spruce, collecting beetles emerging from the bark (details in Table 1, Fig. 2). In the close vicinity of the plots a pheromone trap was installed (commonly used Theysohn® type trap baited with Pheroprax® aggregation lure). The total area under the eclectors varied on the plots and the results of the collected beetles were interpreted accordingly, per unit of covered area. Beetles emerging in the eclectors and those trapped in the pheromone traps were collected on a weekly basis and counted in the laboratory. The trial started on April 19 and ended on June 9 covering fully the flight of the first, spring generation of spruce bark beetle. This statement is backed up by the parallel pheromone monitoring network data, which clearly confirm the onset and decline of the beetles spring swarm. The obtained results confirmed that the eight toothed spruce bark beetle does overwinter in the forest litter. The ratio between adults staying in their developmental sites (spruce bark) and those that entered forest litter varied in the two plots. In the higher plot the ratio was 50 : 50. The lower plot revealed a ratio of 60 : 40 in favor of beetles using bark instead of litter as an overwintering niche (Fig. 4). Assuming the altitudinal to zonal conversion concept, at least on a trend level, the obtained results correspond with the described tendency of south-north preference shift towards the forest litter as an overwintering niche. More importantly, the mere fact that after their full development in late summer/early fall, tenure adults of eight toothed spruce bark beetle enter litter, as confirmed by this research in a typical Croatian forest where spruce grows naturally, sheds new light on the efficiency of <b>sanitation</b> <b>felling.</b> The guidance tactics derived by this research dictate early logging operations, before the end of summer and in the period when beetles are still under the bark. This is especially important when stands are at higher elevations or grow in very harsh winter conditions in terms of temperature. Lower elevations, on the other hand, leave more time to sanitation logging, provided that the operations (removal of attacked trees) are finished before the onset of the beetle spring swarming. The efficiency of sanitation logging, as a part of the integrated bark beetle management, therefore, strongly depends on the proportion of the beetles overwintering in the forest litter. This might help to better understand the various efficiency and uneven impact of <b>sanitation</b> <b>felling</b> on bark beetle outbreak foci in the past in the Croatian spruce forests. Phenological data derived from the temporal analysis of bark beetle appearances in eclectors and pheromone lures (Fig. 3) also give some interesting and useful biological and forestry data. The recorded time lag of roughly two weeks between the start of emergence and peak pheromone trapped beetles on the two plots fits within the concept of the known zonal/altitudinal phenological shift. The practical value lies in the fact that it has been firstly recorded in more detail in one of the Croatian most important spruce growing region. Also, the documented time lag between the first emergers (both bark and forest litter) and first pheromone trapped beetles illustrates the known phenomenon of the first flight phase of the spruce bark beetle – the dispersal flight. The reason why this time lag was longer in the lower plot and shorter in the higher plot is explained by the possible immigration of earlier emerged beetles in the lower elevations lured to the pheromone trap in the higher elevated plot. Also, the duration and dynamics of beetle emergence on both plots varies significantly and is related to climatic regime in the plot area, which was measured (temperature, dew point, absolute and relative humidity) but not presented in this paper. What is evident from the pheromone trap catches (Fig. 3) is the narrower curve of the flying period of the first generation beetles in the higher plot versus lengthier swarming period in the lower plot (two weeks versus two weeks). In our opinion the most important outcome of this research for the Croatian forestry practice is the confirmation that forest litter is an overwintering niche of the eight toothed spruce bark beetle. In spite of the geographical position, i. e. the south part of the common spruce and spruce bark beetle distribution, the Croatian forestry must take into account that a significant part of beetle population can be missed by early fall or spring during sanitation operations, consequently enabling the beetle outbreaks to continue at an unacceptable pace. From the entomological point of view, it would be interesting to continue the research deeper in terms of within–the–species variability of Croatian spruce bark beetle populations. Assuming the fact that these populations are genetically old and wide in ecological plasticity, it is reasonable to expect that they can easily adapt to changing climatic conditions, escaping the winter mortal subzero temperatures by shift in ratio of cohorts of beetles choosing bark or litter as their overwintering niche...|$|E

Na dvjema pokusnim plohama koje su postavljene u proljeće 2008. godine na sjevernom Velebitu, metodom je eklektora utvrđeno da dio imaga smrekova pisara, osim kore napadnutih dubećih smreka, za prezimljavanje se koristi i šumskom steljom. Udio zimujuće populacije imaga u stelji na objema lokacijama istraživanja značajan je i iznosi do 40 % u Štirovači (1080 m n. v.) i do 50 % u blizini Zavižana (1404 m n. v.). Istraživanjem su također utvrđena i neka fenološka obilježja populacija potkornjaka u vršnoj zoni Velebita i u Štirovači, poput duljega trajanja prvoga proljetnoga rojenja u Štirovači (četiri tjedna) u odnosu na Zavižan (dva tjedna), te vremenskoga pomaka od dva tjedna u početku i vrhunjenju rojenja između tih dviju lokacija istraživanja. Poredbenom raščlambom izlazaka i aktivacije imaga potkornjaka na postavljenim eklektorima i ulovima obližnjih feromonskih klopki utvrđeno je da se prvi ulovi u feromonskim klopkama pojavljuju tri tjedna nakon što su zabilježeni izlasci iz kore dubećih smreka i šumske stelje. Takav je odmak uočen u Štirovači, dok je u vršnoj zoni Zavižana iznosio oko dva tjedna. Rezultati provedenih bioloških i fenoloških istraživanja omogućuju racionalniji pristup u sanaciji žarišta napada smrekova pisara maksimiziranjem napora u razdoblju prije početka jeseni, u vrijeme dok se još nije rasula populacija potkornjaka na dio koji ostaje pod smrekovom korom i dio koji se zavlači u četinjak. U situacijama kada to nije provedivo, može se očekivati povoljniji učinak ranih proljetnih mjera sanacije na terenima nižih nadmorskih visina gdje je manji udio populacije imaga potkornjaka koji se za prezimljavanje koriste šumskom steljom.

40|$|The {{pathogen}} Gremmeniella abietina causes {{severe damage}} to native Pinus sylvestris and introduced Pinus contorta var. latifolia in Sweden. The recent G. abietina outbreak in 2001 – 2003, {{caused by the}} large tree type (LTT), affected at least 480, 000 ha of middle-aged P. sylvestris stands and forced Swedish forest owners to sanitary clear-cut large areas of valuable forests. There was, however, little knowledge of survival and growth loss of infected trees and risks involved in replanting P. sylvestris in the G. abietina-infected slash. In this thesis, G. abietina disease incidence on P. sylvestris seedlings planted after <b>sanitation</b> <b>felling</b> was studied, with and without removal of infected P. sylvestris slash. Furthermore, survival and vitality of G. abietina in the slash was studied by spore germination tests of pycnidia collected from infected slash at regular intervals. One year after planting, G. abietina pycnidia were found on 32 % of the control seedlings and total infection, including stem cankers, reached 44 %. Removal of infected slash {{reduced the number of}} infected seedlings by 50 % and seedling mortality by 27 %, one year after planting. The vitality of G. abietina in the slash was as high in pycnidia collected in 13 - to 18 -months-old slash as in pycnidia collected in fresh slash. It is recommended to wait at least two years after sanitary fellings before replanting with P. sylvestris. To improve the accuracy of predictions of mortality and growth losses in infected, pole-sized P. sylvestris stands, mortality, diameter growth and insect colonisation were monitored and related to crown defoliation in four 40 -year-old stands in 2001 – 2005. Of the killed trees, 84 % were at least 90 % defoliated the year before they died and trees with less than 90 % defoliation were only killed in the initial phase of the outbreak. A majority of the trees were killed directly by G. abietina whereas less than one third died after colonisation by pine shoot beetle (Tomicus piniperda), a pest that was mainly found on dead trees or trees with at least 95 % defoliation. A greater fraction of small trees died and generally did so more rapidly than larger trees. Regression analysis indicated that a mean defoliation of 2 / 3 of the crown resulted in an average loss of 50 % in diameter increment. Based on this study, a defoliation limit of 75 – 80 % is recommended for sanitary cutting of P. sylvestris trees in the initial phases of an outbreak, and a limit of ca. 90 % for trees that survive the initial phases of an outbreak. The interest in the productive P. contorta as an alternative to P. sylvestris is currently increasing in Sweden. To study the resistance of P. contorta to LTT G. abietina, seedlings of P. contorta and P. sylvestris were planted in gaps of an infected 40 -year-old P. sylvestris stand in 2005. After two years, 45 % of the P. contorta seedlings and 32 % of the P. sylvestris seedlings were infected. However, mortality was lower and the mean length of infected tissue on surviving seedlings significantly shorter in P. contorta (3. 9 cm) compared to P. sylvestris (10. 4 cm). Furthermore, 47 % of the P. contorta seedlings had developed new leader shoots in 2007, compared to 19 % of the P. sylvestris seedlings. Histopathological examinations of infected shoots showed that both P. contorta and P. sylvestris produce ligno-suberised boundaries that are involved in the active defence in the shoots, preventing major crown dieback. The results indicate that P. contorta is more resistant to LTT G. abietina than P. sylvestris...|$|E
