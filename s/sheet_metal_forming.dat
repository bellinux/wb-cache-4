50|$|Knowledge of the {{material}} formability {{is very important to}} the layout and design of any industrial forming process. Simulations using the finite-element method and use of formability criteria such as the forming limit curve (forming limit diagram) enhance and, in some cases, are indispensable to certain tool design processes (also see: <b>Sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>forming</b> simulation and <b>Sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>forming</b> analysis).|$|E
50|$|Another {{example of}} an {{orthotropic}} material is <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>formed</b> by squeezing thick sections of metal between heavy rollers. This flattens and stretches its grain structure. As a result, the material becomes anisotropicâ€”its properties differ between the direction it was rolled in {{and each of the}} two transverse directions.|$|R

5|$|Similar alloys {{with the}} {{addition}} of a small amount of lead can be cold-rolled into sheets. An alloy of 96% zinc and 4% aluminium is used to make stamping dies for low production run applications for which ferrous metal dies would be too expensive. For building facades, roofing, and other applications for <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>formed</b> by deep drawing, roll forming, or bending, zinc alloys with titanium and copper are used. Unalloyed zinc is too brittle for these manufacturing processes.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} determining forming limit curves based {{on a combination of}} experiments with finite element analysis. In the experiment a set of 6 samples with different geometries underwent plastic deformation in stretch forming till the appearance of fracture. The heights of the stamped parts at fracture moment were measured. The <b>sheet</b> - <b>metal</b> <b>forming</b> process for each sample was numerically simulated using Finite Element Analysis (FEA). The values of the calculated plastic strains at the moment when the simulated cup reaches the height of the real cup at fracture initiation were marked on the FLC. FLCs for stainless steel sheets: ASM 5504, 5596 and 5599 have been determined. The resultant FLCs are then used in the numerical simulations of <b>sheet</b> - <b>metal</b> <b>forming.</b> A comparison between the strains in the numerically simulated drawn - parts and limit strains gives the information if the <b>sheet</b> - <b>metal</b> <b>forming</b> process was designed properly...|$|R

50|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Hugo Junkers and his company's research institute, or Forschungsanstalt, began the engineering work to realize Junkers' idea of creating aircraft designs that dispensed with drag-producing exterior bracing. His work on Reissner's Ente design had convinced him of the necessity to use metal as the main structural material, but since the apparently ideal metal alloy for aircraft construction, duralumin, had been invented only some six years earlier in Germany, and was initially prone to flaking and other undesirable characteristics when worked in <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>form,</b> the Junkers firm's initial all-metal aircraft designs had to use sheets of heavier electrical steel, similar to the types of ferrous <b>sheet</b> <b>metals</b> used in laminated-core AC electrical transformers.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Nowadays {{feasibility}} studies using {{finite element analysis}} are performed in very early design phases of <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> parts <b>forming.</b> Further, simulation technology is used to optimize the first forming stage. Because of the ever intensifying international competition and {{the increased use of}} high-strength steels and aluminum alloys, the absorption of springback deviations is a great chal-lenge, especially in the automotive industry. The application of numerical computation to predict springback deviations and to create compensated die designs in early design phases of <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> parts <b>forming</b> becomes essential. At DaimlerChrysler the numerically based compensation of springback deviations during the die development process of complex car parts is achieved. How-ever, developments to optimize and compensate dies automatically or to predict form deviations on assemblies are still necessary...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Combining {{the loading}} {{conditions}} {{of two different}} classes of forming operations, in <b>sheet</b> bulk <b>metal</b> <b>forming</b> processes, contact pressures ranging from a few hundred MPa up to loads exceeding 2, 500 MPa are experienced. With the additional need for an enhanced control of the material flow, which is best implemented by locally adapted frictional properties of the contact tool/workpiece, <b>sheet</b> bulk <b>metal</b> <b>forming</b> represents a challenge to tribology. As a consequence, {{the evaluation of the}} friction and wear properties of different surface modifications and lubricants within a variety of loading conditions is required. The load-scanning test is a universal tribological model test. Its most distinctive feature is the ability to assess the friction and wear behaviour of a tribological pairing within a whole range of contact loads in a single test run. The simple and quick test method also allows the investigation of plastic contacts. Due to these features, the load-scanning test is of particular interest with regard to the quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the application potentials and limits of use of tribological measures intended for <b>sheet</b> bulk <b>metal</b> <b>forming.</b> Like any model test, the load-scanning test has also specific drawbacks. In some test setups, the stress distribution in the contact area may be non-uniform. Further, the maximum realizable contact pressure may be limited by low yield strengths of the tested materials in combination with the insufficient flow restriction of the contact geometry and/or the moderate machine force. By comparison to other test methods and by giving examples of its application in different scenarios, the present paper discusses the potentials and limitations of the load-scanning test against the background of <b>sheet</b> bulk <b>metal</b> <b>forming...</b>|$|R
50|$|Zastava Arms of Yugoslavia {{originally}} developed this rifle from its experience in making its M70 rifles (a {{variant of the}} AKM with some minor differences from the original), particularly the M76. All of the rifles in the M70 series share what is traditionally considered an RPK style receiver, that is the receiver is made with a thicker gauge of <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>formed</b> over a larger and heavier trunnion.
