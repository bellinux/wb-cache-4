5|$|When {{cooperation}} resumed in September 1943, Groves and Oppenheimer {{revealed the}} existence of the Los Alamos Laboratory to Chadwick, Peierls and Oliphant. Oppenheimer wanted all three to proceed to Los Alamos as soon as possible, but it was decided that Oliphant would go to Berkeley to work on the electromagnetic process and Peierls would go to New York to work on the gaseous diffusion process. The task then fell to Chadwick. The original idea, favoured by Groves, was that the British <b>scientists</b> <b>would</b> work as a group under Chadwick, who would farm out work to them. This was soon discarded in favour of having the British Mission fully integrated into the laboratory. They worked in most of its divisions, only being excluded from plutonium chemistry and metallurgy.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} 150years, other expeditions, explorers, and <b>scientists</b> <b>would</b> piece {{together}} what happened next. Franklin's men wintered in 1845–46 on Beechey Island, where three crew members died and were buried. Terror and Erebus became trapped in ice off King William Island in September 1846 and never sailed again. According to a note dated 25 April 1848, and {{left on the}} island by Fitzjames and Crozier, Franklin had died on 11 June 1847; the crew had wintered on King William Island in 1846–47 and 1847–48, and the remaining crew had planned to begin walking on 26 April 1848 toward the Back River on the Canadian mainland. Nine officers and fifteen men had already died; the rest would die along the way, most {{on the island and}} another 30 or 40 on the northern coast of the mainland, hundreds of miles from the nearest outpost of Western civilization.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} and most {{important}} naturalists to be convinced by Origin of the reality of evolution was the British anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley. Huxley recognized that unlike the earlier transmutational ideas of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, Darwin's theory provided a mechanism for evolution without supernatural involvement, even if Huxley himself was not completely convinced that natural selection was the key evolutionary mechanism. Huxley would make advocacy of evolution a cornerstone of the program of the X Club to reform and professionalise science by displacing natural theology with naturalism and to end the domination of British natural science by the clergy. By the early 1870s in English-speaking countries, thanks partly to these efforts, evolution had become the mainstream scientific explanation for the origin of species. In his campaign for public and scientific acceptance of Darwin's theory, Huxley made extensive use of new evidence for evolution from paleontology. This included evidence that birds had evolved from reptiles, including the discovery of Archaeopteryx in Europe, and a number of fossils of primitive birds with teeth found in North America. Another important line of evidence was the finding of fossils that helped trace the evolution of the horse from its small five-toed ancestors. However, acceptance of evolution among scientists in non-English speaking nations such as France, and the countries of southern Europe and Latin America was slower. An exception to this was Germany, where both August Weismann and Ernst Haeckel championed this idea: Haeckel used evolution to challenge the established tradition of metaphysical idealism in German biology, much as Huxley used it to challenge natural theology in Britain. Haeckel and other German <b>scientists</b> <b>would</b> take the lead in launching an ambitious programme to reconstruct the evolutionary history of life based on morphology and embryology.|$|E

5|$|The Los Alamos Laboratory was {{reinforced}} by a British Mission under James Chadwick. The first to arrive were Otto Frisch and Ernest Titterton; later arrivals included Niels Bohr and his son Aage Bohr, and Sir Geoffrey Taylor, an expert on hydrodynamics who made a major contribution {{to the understanding of}} the Rayleigh–Taylor instability. This instability at the interface between two fluids of different densities occurs when the lighter fluid is pushing the heavier, and was vital to the interpretation of experiments with explosives, predicting the effects of an explosion, the design of the neutron initiators, and the design of the atomic bomb itself. Chadwick remained only for a few months; he was succeeded as head of the British Mission by Rudolf Peierls. The original idea, favored by Groves, was that the British <b>scientists</b> <b>would</b> work as a group under Chadwick, who would farm out work to them. This was soon discarded in favor of having the British Mission fully integrated into the laboratory. They worked in most of its divisions, only being excluded from plutonium chemistry and metallurgy. With the passage of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, known as the McMahon Act, all British government employees had to leave. All had left by the end of 1946, except for Titterton, who was granted a special dispensation, and remained until 12 April 1947. The British Mission ended when he departed.|$|E

25|$|The Nature Index {{tracks the}} affiliations {{of high quality}} {{scientific}} articles published in 68 science journals independently chosen by the scientific community as the journals <b>scientists</b> <b>would</b> most like to publish their best research in. Updated monthly, the Nature Index presents research reports of approximately 9,000 parent institutions worldwide presenting a page of output statistics for each institution along with information on institutions collaborating with the institution in the publication of Index articles. Each of the approximately 60,000 articles in the Index has a dedicated article page with social and mainstream media coverage tracked by Altmetric. League tables of output of institutions can be generated on the fly on a global, regional or country basis and by broad subject area {{as well as by}} article count and fractional article count. Compare with other metrics of science (e.g., Impact Factor, h-index), Nature Index is the prominent scientific journal ranking with global reputation on original natural science and life science research. Tracing the flow of scientific knowledge into economic and social benefit is a growing priority for governments and research funding agencies. Nature Index Innovation examines the connection between high-quality research and the commercialization of new products and services. In particular, it highlights the use of references to academic literature in patents to show concrete links between discovery and its economic potential.|$|E
500|$|In August 2006, Steorn {{placed an}} {{advertisement}} in The Economist {{saying that they}} had developed a technology that produced [...] "free, clean and constant energy". Called Orbo, the technology was said to violate conservation of energy but had been validated by eight independent scientists.

500|$|Similar {{confusion}} {{is involved in}} objections that evolution is [...] "unproven," [...] since no theory in science {{is known to be}} absolutely true, only verified by empirical evidence. This distinction is an important one in philosophy of science, {{as it relates to the}} lack of absolute certainty in all empirical claims, not just evolution. Strict proof is possible only in formal sciences such as logic and mathematics, not natural sciences (where terms such as [...] "validated" [...] or [...] "corroborated" [...] are more appropriate). Thus, to say that evolution is not proven is trivially true, but no more an indictment of evolution than calling it a [...] "theory." [...] The confusion arises in that the colloquial meaning of proof is simply [...] "compelling evidence," [...] in which case <b>scientists</b> <b>would</b> indeed consider evolution [...] "proven." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} {{intention was}} that the <b>scientists</b> <b>would</b> stay on Campania, commuting to the islands each day, but the survey party had misjudged the tides; Campania could not enter the lagoon, and had to anchor in the Parting Pool. The pinnaces could not tie up alongside Campania at night, {{and had to be}} moored several miles away. Transferring to the boats in choppy waters was hazardous. One scientist fell in the sea and was rescued by Commander Douglas Bromley, Campanias executive officer. Rough seas prevented much work being done between 10 and 14 August. It took {{about an hour and a}} half to get from Campania to H2, and travelling between Plym and Campania took between two and three hours. Even when a boat was on call it could take 45 minutes to respond. Boat availability soon became a problem with only five LCMs, leaving personnel waiting for one to arrive. The twelve smaller LCAs were also employed; although they could operate when the tides made waters too shallow for the pinnaces, their wooden bottoms were easily holed by coral outcrops. On 15 August, some men were transferred from Campania by one of its three Dragonfly [...] helicopters, but the weather closed in and they could not be picked up again, having to find shelter on Tracker and Zeebrugge, which were moored in the lagoon. To get around these problems, tented camps were established for the scientists at H1 on Hermite Island and Cocoa Beach (also known as T2) on Trimouille Island.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{shortcoming}} {{stemmed from}} Kahn's belief that <b>scientists</b> <b>would</b> work better {{in an open}} studio setting if given the chance. [...] He designed each floor of the laboratory towers potentially as one large room and trusted that the <b>scientists</b> <b>would</b> see the desirability of keeping it that way to encourage the interchange of ideas. [...] Most scientists disliked that approach, however, preferring privacy and even secrecy, so partitions {{were put in place}} on almost all floors. [...] Kahn was so sure that his approach was the right one that he continued to speak of it afterwards as an important aspect of the design.|$|E

50|$|The role {{experimentation}} {{played in}} this process was twofold. The most laborious job of the <b>scientist</b> <b>would</b> be to gather the facts, or 'histories', required to create the tables of presence and absence.

2500|$|Micrographia also {{contains}} Hooke's, or perhaps Boyle and Hooke's, ideas on combustion.

2500|$|By contrast, {{neurologist}} Terence Hines of Pace University {{is strongly}} {{critical of the}} studies and has stated that they are flawed.

2500|$|There {{is always}} {{disagreement}} between fishermen and government scientists... Imagine an overfished {{area of the}} sea {{in the shape of}} a hockey field with nets at either end.
