5|$|From {{the time}} of the invasion, {{significant}} numbers of Belgian men had attempted to flee the occupied territories to join the Belgian army on the Yser front, via the Netherlands which were neutral. In order to <b>stop</b> <b>this,</b> the Germans began work on a barbed wire and electric fence across the length of the border. The fence, dubbed the Wire of Death (Dodendraad), was also guarded by German sentries. Between 2,000 and 3,000 civilians are believed to have been killed attempting to cross the border during the conflict.|$|E
5|$|In August 1992, Greyhound {{canceled}} its {{bus terminal}} license (BTL) agreements with other carriers at 200 terminals, and imposed {{the requirement that}} Greyhound be the sole-seller of the tenant's bus tickets within a 25-mile radius of such a Greyhound terminal. In 1995, The United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division brought suit to <b>stop</b> <b>this</b> practice, alleging {{that it was an}} illegal restraint of trade, bad for consumers, and reduced competition. In February 1996, the United States won its case, and Greyhound agreed to permit its tenants to sell tickets nearby and permit its tenants to honor interline tickets with competitors.|$|E
5|$|In December 2001, {{a single}} morning rush-hour round trip branded SLExpress was {{extended}} to Stamford, with a stop at Bridgeport plus eastbound-only stops at Stratford and Milford. An evening eastbound trip was also extended to Stamford with only the Bridgeport intermediate <b>stop.</b> <b>This</b> trip was intended to allow commuters to reach employment centers in Bridgeport and Stamford without having to make a transfer at New Haven. On June 24, 2002, additional Stamford trains were added, {{for a total of}} two westbound and three eastbound trains. When West Haven opened in August 2013, it was added to these trips as well.|$|E

5|$|On 7 April, {{elements}} of XLVI Motorised Corps crossed the Drava at Gyékényes and attacked towards Koprivnica. Available {{troops of the}} 27th Infantry Division Savska took up defensive positions to <b>stop</b> <b>this</b> German penetration and Petrović ordered Nedeljković to mount a counter-attack against the bridgehead. By nightfall the counter-attack had not materialised, the defenders had withdrawn to Koprivnica, and Petrović had ordered Nedeljković to counter-attack on the following morning. Also on 7 April, the few remaining reconnaissance aircraft of the 4th Army mounted attacks on a bridge over the Drava at Gyékényes. On 8 April, the XLVI Motorised Corps continued with its limited objective attacks to expand its bridgehead at Gyékényes.|$|E

If the bottle is knocked over and the die knocked onto the table, the player is awarded points equal to whatever side of the die lies facing upward when the die comes to a <b>stop.</b> <b>This</b> adds a random effect to hitting the bottle and in practice often results in players only striking the bottle in combination with other point-scoring shots.|$|E

5|$|Vandegrift {{ordered the}} {{withdrawal}} {{because of the}} receipt of intelligence from coastwatchers, aerial reconnaissance, and radio intercepts that a major Japanese reinforcement effort was imminent. Indeed, the Japanese {{were in the process}} of attempting to deliver the 10,000 remaining troops from the 38th Division to Guadalcanal in order to reattempt to capture Henderson Field. The resulting efforts by the Americans to <b>stop</b> <b>this</b> reinforcement attempt resulted in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, the decisive naval battle of the Guadalcanal campaign, in which the Japanese reinforcement effort was turned back.|$|E
5|$|Denise Mina had {{not written}} for comics {{when she took}} over the title in 2006, but had three {{acclaimed}} crime novels to her name, the Garnetthill trilogy, {{the first of which}} won the CWA award for best debut crime novel. Her run on the title took John to Scotland, to attempt to stop a plot to make everybody empathise with each other. However, John fails to <b>stop</b> <b>this,</b> and, overwhelmed by the grief and horror they're forced to empathically share, suicides abound through the people of Glasgow. With help from Gemma Constantine, Angie Spatchcock and Chas Chandler, a plan to reverse the problem is made, as tension builds among the soldiers now surrounding the city. The soldiers keenly listen to a World Cup match between England and Portugal on the radio. When England loses the match, it seems all is lost, but the expected psychic riot fails to materialize. The soldiers are Scottish, so England's loss is celebrated, saving the day, and proving there's no source of joy like Schadenfreude.|$|E
5|$|In mid-March 1890 Kruger met the new British High Commissioner and Governor Sir Henry Brougham Loch, Loch's {{legal adviser}} William Philip Schreiner, and Rhodes, who had by now {{attained}} a dominant {{position in the}} Transvaal's mining industry and a royal charter for his British South Africa Company to occupy and administer Matabeleland and Mashonaland. A group of Transvaalers planned to emigrate to Mashonaland—the so-called Bowler Trek—and Rhodes was keen to <b>stop</b> <b>this</b> lest it interfere with his own plans. He and Loch offered to support Kruger in his plan to acquire a port at Kosi Bay and link it to the Transvaal through Swaziland if in return the Transvaal would enter a South African customs union and pledge not to expand northwards. Kruger made no commitments, thinking this union might easily turn into the federation Britain had pursued years before, but on his return to Pretoria forbade any Boer trek to Mashonaland.|$|E

5|$|Kotarou becomes {{disillusioned with}} Guardian's tactics {{and returns to}} Kazamatsuri where he meets Kagari again. She tells him she must {{initiate}} re-evolution, but since this {{would lead to a}} dead world, Kagari must find good memories brought out through the betterment of life on Earth, as opposed to bad memories caused by war and conflict. Kotarou agrees to help her and he acts as a double agent, demolishing Gaia's and Guardian's infrastructure in Kazamatsuri and killing those on either side. Kazamatsuri is partly destroyed when Gaia attempts to force Kagari to initiate re-evolution, but Kotarou manages to <b>stop</b> <b>this</b> from occurring. As a result, Kagari praises Kotarou and shows gratitude for showing her satisfactory memories. Kotarou unwillingly stabs Kagari, and after a kiss, they evolve into an orb of light inside a tree.|$|E
5|$|On the 36th lap, Glock's right-rear {{suspension}} failed {{coming out}} of the final corner. He spun through 180 degrees before hitting the pit wall with a strong rearward impact, with debris flying across the track. The car, pointing the wrong way, rolled to a stop on the grass. A dazed Glock extracted himself before being treated at the medical centre. The safety car was deployed after the accident. When the pit lane opened on lap38, most drivers headed in, including all of the leaders except Hamilton. McLaren believed that Hamilton had enough fuel to stay out, the plan being for him to then rapidly pull away from his heavily-fuelled rivals, after the safety car went in. Hamilton needed to build up enough of a lead to rejoin still in first position, following his final pit <b>stop.</b> <b>This</b> would prove to be very risky, as Massa rejoined in fourth position, fuelled to the finish.|$|E
5|$|The Class 93 was {{put into}} service {{as part of the}} Agenda {{regional}} train concept. Along with the Class 70 InterCity Express trains in Eastern Norway, the Class 93 would serve the regional services of NSB. Trains were initially put into service in 2000 on the Nordland Line, followed by the Rauma and Røros Line. The trains had several operational problems, some related to humidity, creating situations where the both engines would <b>stop.</b> <b>This</b> caused NSB in 2002 to demand an interior and technical reconfiguration by Bombardier. One year after delivery, six of eleven trains were out of order. To solve the problem, NSB had to rent back used Di3 locomotives from Ofotbanen. NSB had chosen to sell the old locomotives for less than market price, but Ofotbanen demanded that NSB pay the entire purchase price for the short-term rental back. The brand name Agenda failed, since customers were dissatisfied with the new stock, and NSB chose to discontinue the branding, just calling all former Agenda and Signatur trains regional trains.|$|E

5|$|Walter (John Noble) has {{prepared}} himself to reveal to Peter (Joshua Jackson) the truththat {{he is from}} the parallel universewhen they are called to a case. Two teenagers were found dead, evidently killed by shapeshifter agents from the parallel universe. Exploring the nearby area, they find a third unformed shapeshifter which Walter takes to the lab to study. At the same time of the teenagers' death, they find a carrier signal in the local television. With biotechnology corporation Massive Dynamic's help, they determine that the signal emanated from the parallel universe during a brief moment that the two universes were in sync, and that the next point of synchronization would occur the next afternoon. Recalling Thomas Jerome Newton's (Sebastian Roché) previous attempt to bring a building from the parallel universe into the prime, the Fringe team believes they must <b>stop</b> <b>this</b> next attempt.|$|E
5|$|A third ship, the Manantico also {{crashed into}} shore {{due to a}} {{combination}} of the storm and human error in which the captain confused Cape Henry with Cape Charles after spotting another schooner. The Manantico was also where the two deaths associated with the storm occurred. The first was when a cook on the ship was crushed to death by the cargo of lumber being hauled by the ship. The ship was then pushed towards a sand bar. The captain, who had stayed high on the starboard side for safety, began climbing down to slip the ship cables, but the ship made a sudden <b>stop.</b> <b>This</b> flung the captain into the water, and he drowned. Both bodies were found after the storm and were very disfigured. The captain was sent to Middletown, Connecticut for interment while the body of the cook was buried on the beach. The final ship was the Harriet Thomas, which was the schooner spotted by the Manantico. After beaching, the crew managed to get a rope to shore where fishermen had tied the other end. The crew were able to climb ashore, although the captain had to be rescued via alternate means due to being too heavy for this method. The ship was written off as a $7000 (1887 USD) loss. Although all four ships were beached, due to the loss of communications, only one wreck – that of the Mary D. Cranmer – was reported in the Norfolk Virginian newspaper. As a result, news of the two deaths from the Manantico were initially unreported.|$|E
5|$|The {{air raids}} on Singapore raised {{the morale of}} the island's {{civilian}} population. They were seen as heralding Singapore's liberation from Japan's oppressive rule, though civilians were generally careful to hide this belief from Japanese occupation personnel. The B-29s were widely believed to be invulnerable, and civilians were cheered by their apparent ability to attack the Japanese at will. In an attempt to counter this view, the occupation authorities exhibited wreckage from downed B-29s and surviving crew members as well as film footage of a Superfortress being shot down. This propaganda campaign was not successful. The Japanese also failed in their attempts to rouse Singapore's Muslim population against the raids by highlighting damage suffered by a mosque on 11January and 24February, the latter a raid which coincided with the celebration of Muhammad's birthday. Another factor which contributed to public support for the raids was that the policy of targeting military installations meant that {{only a limited number of}} civilians became casualties, and the American bombing came to be seen as highly accurate. The expectation of further attacks caused the prices of food and other commodities to rise, however, as people stockpiled necessities; Japanese attempts to <b>stop</b> <b>this</b> hoarding and profiteering were not successful.|$|E
