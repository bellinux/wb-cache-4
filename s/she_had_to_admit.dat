2500|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Byrd had no history of drug {{addiction}} or abuse and no criminal record, {{she felt like she}} {{had no choice but to}} agree to drug court supervision or go to prison. Then came the catch-22; she was told <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> to drug use and addiction or she couldn't get into the program.|$|E
60|$|It was Cynthia's turn to laugh. She {{could not}} decide whether {{he were a}} man or a boy. Sometimes, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit,</b> he was very much of a man.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right," [...] replied Orcutt, {{and marched}} off. Janet felt rather sorry for him, though <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that his manner was exasperating. But Ditmar's anger, instead of cooling, increased: {{it all seemed}} {{directed}} against the unfortunate superintendent.|$|E
5000|$|Outraged when {{he finds}} out, Chris' main competitor, Atlas Newsreel's Bill Dennis (Walter Pidgeon) decides to do the same, having his aviator friend Alma Harding (Myrna Loy) fly in [...] "serum" [...] for an {{imaginary}} cholera outbreak. Chris finds out and swoops in to film her landing. José, however, drives {{too close to the}} aircraft, causing it to crash and burst into flames. Chris rescues Alma, but when he starts to go back for the serum, <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> the truth, telling him that it is a fake.|$|R
60|$|A {{decrepit}} {{old woman}} opened the door, and on Guy giving his name {{she said that}} <b>she</b> <b>had</b> orders <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> him if he called. The girl came out dressed in her female attire as he went upstairs.|$|R

6000|$|... "Of course I will {{mention it}} when I write him," [...] said Anne, a trifle distantly. Somehow, {{this was a}} thing she could not discuss with Miss Cornelia. And yet, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that the same thought had been lurking in her mind ever since she had heard of Leslie's freedom. But she would not desecrate it by free speech.|$|E
6000|$|If Mrs. Brook cast {{about it}} was but for a few seconds. [...] "If she had known you were coming she would {{certainly}} have been here. She wanted so to please you."

50|$|There seems <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been of no {{information}} about Constance's education or background but according <b>to</b> the visions <b>she</b> <b>had,</b> <b>she</b> <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> not knowing the Book of Revelation. Constance never indicated she did any particular reading and any literacy Constance <b>admits</b> seems <b>to</b> seems <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been of miraculous origin.

60|$|She {{had hoped}} before she voiced her sentiments {{that it would}} not be {{necessary}} for her to enter into the transaction at all, for she believed that Clayton was amply able to cope with every emergency, but <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that so far at least he had shown no greater promise of successfully handling the situation than any of the others, though he had at least refrained from adding in any way to the unpleasantness, even going so far as to give up the tin to the sailors when they objected to its being opened by him.|$|E
60|$|Nevertheless Mr. Brinsmade {{drove to}} the Arsenal with her that Saturday, in his own carriage. Forgetful of his own grief, long habit came to him to talk cheerily with her. He told her many little anecdotes of his travel, but {{not one of them}} did she hear. Again, at the moment when she thought her belief in Clarence and her love for him at last secure, she found herself drawing searching {{comparisons}} between him and the quieter young Bostonian. In spite of herself <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that Stephen's deed was splendid. Was this disloyal? She flushed at the thought. Clarence had been capable of the deed,--even to the rescue of an enemy. But--alas, that she should carry it out to a remorseless end--would Clarence have been equal to keeping silence when Mr. Brinsmade came to him? Stephen Brice had not even told his mother, so Mr. Brinsmade believed.|$|E
60|$|She had {{sat there}} for five minutes or so, and her {{thoughts}} had had time to grow dim, when there came a ring at her bell. Her eye brightened; she felt immediately convinced that Ralph had come to visit her. Accordingly, she waited a moment before opening the door; she wanted to feel her hands secure upon the reins of all the troublesome emotions which the sight of Ralph would certainly arouse. She composed herself unnecessarily, however, for <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit,</b> not Ralph, but Katharine and William Rodney. Her first impression {{was that they were}} both extremely well dressed. She felt herself shabby and slovenly beside them, and did not know how she should entertain them, nor could she guess why they had come. She had heard nothing of their engagement. But after the first disappointment, she was pleased, for she felt instantly that Katharine was a personality, and, moreover, she need not now exercise her self-control.|$|E
50|$|<b>She</b> may <b>have</b> {{made one}} new friend, but it doesn't {{take long for}} Emily {{to realize that the}} long-standing rivalry <b>she</b> <b>had</b> with Cassandra back in high school is only going to grow. Now, both Emily and Cassandra are {{competing}} to impress the brilliant but stern and intolerant Dr. Gina Bandari (Necar Zadegan), a world-famous cardiothoracic surgeon who has been an inspiration and role model to both of them for years. While Emily and Cassandra vie for Dr. Bandari's approval, they're also competing for Will's attention. Will and Emily were friends in med school, although his handsome face and charming personality left Emily hoping for more. Will has made it clear, however, that he likes their relationship the way it is. Emily struggles to convince herself that being friends with Will is enough, but <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> it bothers her just to see Will and Cassandra talking together.|$|R

50|$|Bowles, {{who was an}} alcoholic, {{suffered}} a stroke in 1957 at age 40. The stroke affected her sight and capacity to imagine, however, she pushed through her health issues and continued to write.

6000|$|... "Look here, Will," [...] he resumed, [...] "I {{have three}} men {{standing}} in my outer {{office at the}} present moment. Two of them have come back after having questioned the past servants of the Grosvenor Square household. There was the butler Parker, and an elderly housekeeper, {{both of whom are}} in service in the West End. The woman tried to screen Luke and to make light of the many quarrels which broke out between the cousins on all possible occasions; but she broke down under our fellows' sharp questions. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that the arrogance of the one man often drove the other to unguarded language, and that she had {{on more than one occasion}} heard the men servants of the house say that they would not be astonished if murder ensued one day. Well, we have these two witnesses, and can easily get hold of the two or three footmen who expressed those particular views. So much for the past six months. Now for last night. The third man who is out there waiting for me to see him is Frederick Power, hall porter at the Veterans' Club. The story which he told to our Mr. Travers is so important in its minutest detail, that I have decided to question him myself so that I may leave no possible loop-hole to doubt or to inaccuracy in the retelling. I am going to send for the man now. You come and sit round here, the other side of my desk; from this position you will be able to watch the man's face, as well as hear what he has got to say. Now, would you like that?" ...|$|E

Tim's mum had a private and probing conversation with Rochelle and thought Rochelle hadn't completely let her walls down.Next it was Anna's turn to be introduced to the family and they noticed how uplifting her energy was and how Tim couldn't stop smiling. Tim's sister commented that Tim was being 'himself {{when he was with}} Anna'.

50|$|In the meanwhile, the {{political}} situation had changed radically. The Duke of Burgundy, John the Fearless, was assassinated in September 1419, and the French Dauphin Charles, brother of Jacqueline's first husband, was considered an accomplice and was therefore disinherited in 1420 under the Treaty of Troyes. King Henry V of England then {{claimed to be the}} King of France. In February 1421 Jacqueline issued a statement where she stated that, because of the destructive behaviour of John IV of Brabant, she wanted the annulment of her marriage. The fight against John III, continued until the capture of the city of Leiden, the last city loyal to Jacqueline; after this, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> defeat.|$|E
5000|$|Grayson and Perdy’s {{marriage}} was always rocky {{but the final}} straw was when he had her sectioned. Grayson struggled to cope as Perdy was refusing to see him so Paul visited for him. In Perdy's absence, Rosemary ran Mill Cottage, looked after Grayson and helped Katie run the stables. Consequently, she and Rosemary became friends. Rosemary saw Katie had feelings for Grayson and encouraged her, hoping Grayson would move on and have a family. Katie, however, kept her distance as she refused to steal her best friend's husband.Only Matthew knew Perdy {{was telling the truth}} about Rosemary and her illness but made her realize that to be released, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> to her [...] "illness". Perdy told Grayson that Rosemary was responsible but he didn't believe her until the family doctor backed her up. Grayson confronted his mother and threw her out so she moved in with Paddy Kirk briefly but disappeared after arguments with Grayson, Matthew and Zak Dingle. Fearing Rosemary, Perdy stayed with Matthew but when Rosemary admitted poisoning Perdy, Grayson begged Perdy to give their marriage another chance. She agreed, much to Matthew's disappointment, and began contacting surrogacy agencies to discover if they could have a family.|$|E
50|$|Mary Ann Elizondo {{was found}} guilty of sexually assaulting Robert during a {{separate}} trial from Joe's in 1984, and she was sentenced to 20 yrs in prison. She pleaded no contest to a second charge and was sentenced to 35 years in prison, to be served concurrently with the 20-year term. After Joe and Mary Ann were convicted, Robert and Richard had no further contact with them. It wasn't until 1988, on Robert's 17th birthday, that he found a letter written by his mother, Mary Ann, and learned {{for the first time that}} Joe and Mary Ann were in prison. He then began writing to authorities, letting them know that he had lied when he accused his mother and step-father of sexual abuse. Mary Ann was released on parole in 1991. She then divorced Elizondo, and married someone else. While on parole, she was ordered into group therapy and told <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> to sexually abusing her two sons. When she refused, she was jailed for 6 months, before being released again on parole. A Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus was filed, and in August 1995, a hearing was finally held, concerning the recantations of both boys. Robert Bienvenue testified that his father threatened to spank him and his brother every day for the rest of their lives if they refused to testify against Elizondo and their mother. He said their father wanted to retaliate against his ex-wife for marrying Elizondo. Richard Bienvenue also testified. Though he denied that their father forced them to lie, he said the abuse never occurred.|$|E

50|$|Cleveland Jr. is {{building}} a model rocket for the school science fair which wins him first place. Roberta's new teacher, Ms. Eck (voiced by Jane Lynch) challenges Roberta to prove she can get by without her looks and has her alter her appearance by wearing a 'fat suit'. Her first day as 'Tyra' gets off in an inauspicious start when she is rejected by Federline and the teachers <b>she</b> previously <b>had</b> wrapped around her finger. Cleveland Jr. sees her alone in the cafeteria and warms up to her. When he shows her his model rocket, which is not only failing but is being outmatched by the geeks who are translating Klingon, she helps him with the design flaw. They win the science fair - probably because of the TIE fighters the rocket deployed to attack the geeks - and Ms. Eck gives Roberta an 'A' Grade for proving she more than just looks. However, Cleveland Jr. {{falls in love with}} Roberta and when he tricks her into meeting the family while disguised as Tyra <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> her actions. Cleveland tells her <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> figure a way out of her predicament. She invents a story about moving to Alaska to avoid breaking Cleveland Jr.'s heart.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of the Afro-American Novel is essentially a social and human document, which deals with humanity and its social milieu.

Toni Morrison told herself that she was writing the novel, The Bluest Eye which was an expansion of her earlier story about a little black girl who dreamed of blue eyes, only for herself.
