60|$|The {{old world}} is a wider, more varied stage than the new. By 6000 or 7000 B.C. there were already quasi-civilized {{communities}} almost at the Peruvian level, appearing in various fertile regions of Asia and in the Nile valley. At that time north Persia and western Turkestan and south Arabia were all more fertile than they are now, and there are traces of very early communities in these regions. It is in lower Mesopotamia however and in Egypt that there first appear cities, temples, <b>systematic</b> <b>irrigation,</b> and evidences of a social organization rising above {{the level of a}} mere barbaric village-town. In those days the Euphrates and Tigris flowed by separate mouths into the Persian Gulf, and it was in the country between them that the Sumerians built their first cities. About the same time, for chronology is still vague, the great history of Egypt was beginning.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{limitation of}} available water resources for agricul-ture raises {{the issue of}} an appropriate use of low quality water (partic-ularly brackish or saline water) for agricultural productivity without jeopardizing the quality of soil and its productive capacity. Referring to typical Mediterranean climate conditions and assuming a <b>systematic</b> <b>irrigation</b> use of brackish groundwater, this paper analyzes the capa-bility of yearly rainfall, particularly in fall-winter period, to leach the salts accumulated in the soil during the previous spring-summer irri-gation season. The leaching capability of water supplies exceeding the soil water holding capacity has undergone direct evaluation through a particular experimental arrangement: under a rain shelter, soil columns (inside special cylindrical containers), previously salinized and bare at the surface, were treated with repeated irrigations.

40|$|Comparison of genotypes in {{line source}} based drought {{screening}} {{has a number}} of statistical problems because of the <b>systematic</b> nature of <b>irrigation</b> treatments. A method of applying the joint regression approach has been developed and applied to evaluate sensitivity of 22 groundnut genotypes grown under 11 patterns of drought which were simulated in the field using a line-source sprinkler technique. The experimental errors in neighbouring environments are assumed correlated to account for the systematic nature of the environments. The estimation of parameters of the model and comparison of genotypes for their sensitivity to drought are presented for the pod yield. Stability in performance across the line-source environment was estimated for 22 genotypes. None of the genotypes tested was insensitive to drought across all patterns. Genotypes with stability and high mean yield could be identified in early and mid-season drought patterns but not in other patterns where genotypic sensitivity was strongly correlated with yield performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanics}} of soil erosion from irrigated and rainfed lands are similar. Soil particles are detached, transported and deposited. However, {{there are some}} <b>systematic</b> differences between <b>irrigation</b> and rainfall erosion. Electrolyte concentrations in irrigation water, for example, are almost always greater than in rain water. Differences between rainfall and irrigation are more prominent for surface irrigation than for sprinkler irrigation. For instance, rainfall wets the soil before runoff begins, but water initially flows onto dry soil in irrigation furrows. Furthermore, furrow flow rate decreases with distance and increases with time, while the opposite tends to occur with rainfall. For sprinkler systems, travel direction and slope aspect interact, so runoff can flow within the irrigated area or from the irrigated area onto dry or wet soil. Thus, a sprinkler-irrigation erosion model must consider both the rainfall-runoff situation and the furrow flow situation. These differences in soil and water interactions must be considered before computer models can accurately simulate irrigation-induced soil erosion...|$|R
5000|$|The {{settlers}} {{first made}} contact with the local Tehuelche people almost a year after their arrival. After some difficult early years of suspicion and some violence, the Tehuelche people established cordial relationships with the Welsh and helped the settlement survive the early food shortages. The settlers, led by Aaron Jenkins (whose wife Rachel {{was the first to}} bring up the idea of <b>systematic</b> use of <b>irrigation</b> canals), soon established Argentina's first irrigation system based on the Chubut River (in Welsh, Afon Camwy, [...] "winding river"), irrigating an area three or four miles (five or six km) to each side of the -long stretch of river and creating Argentina's most fertile wheatlands. Initially the settlers were largely self-governing, with all men and women of 18 years of age or over having the right to vote. By 1885 wheat production had reached 6000 tons, with wheat produced by the colony winning the gold medal at international expositions at Paris and Chicago.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{aimed to}} assess the {{reliability}} of a new approach that provides <b>systematic</b> <b>irrigation</b> management based on fixed water suction in the vadose zone. Trials were {{carried out in the}} experimental farm of IRA Gabès on subsurface drip irrigated (SDI) tomato plot. The SDI system was designed so that the soil water content is to be maintained within prescribed interval ascertaining the best plant growth. Irrigation management was systematically monitored by water suction evolution in the vadose zone. Recorded results showed that all-over irrigation season lateral pressure head ranged within 93. 3 ± 20. 0; 119. 95 ± 53. 35 and 106. 6 ± 40. 0 [*]mb, respectively, at the upstream, middle, and downstream. The correspondent lateral pressure head distribution uniformity ranged within 97. 1 % and 99. 6 %. Soil water content varied within 0. 2175 ± 0. 0165; 0. 206 ± 0. 0195 and 0. 284 ± 0. 100 beneath the inlet, the behalf, and the lateral end tip. The correspondent soil water distribution uniformity was higher than 80. 7 % all-over irrigation season. Based on the recorded results, the proposed approach could be a helpful tool for accurate SDI systems design and best water supplies management. Nevertheless, further trials are needed {{to assess the}} approach reliability in different cropping conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{technical}} efficiency of sprinkler irrigation of smallholder sugarcane scheme in the Lubovane area of Swaziland in terms of design parameters, frequency of water application, adequacy of irrigation and irrigation uniformity. The study was done in Imbali Yamadlenya, Nxutsamlo and Ziyanhle irrigation schemes. Data were collected from each scheme using both primary and secondary data sources between June and September 2013. Primary data included informal interviews and field measurements about operations of the schemes while secondary data included literature review and design documents. Data were analyzed using Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel. All the schemes were under-performing in terms of the frequency of irrigation, adequacy and irrigation uniformity. Both Imbali Yamadlenya Farmers Association (FA) and Nxutsamlo FA had their emitters discharging more water than the designed specifications while at Ziyanhle FA the discharge was below the design specification. The flow variations for Imbali Yamadlenya, Nxutsamlo FA and Ziyanhle FA were 9. 3 %, 18. 6 % and - 38. 4 % respectively. The operating pressure variations were found to be 10 %, 8. 6 % and - 40 % for Imbali Yamadlenya FA, Nxutsamlo FA and Ziyanhle FA respectively. The first two schemes were over-irrigated while Ziyanhle FA was under-irrigated. The farmers in all the schemes had no <b>systematic</b> <b>irrigation</b> scheduling. They used the â€œfeelâ€ method to determine soil moisture content with one irrigation pattern adopted for the entire season. The calculated CWRs were 4. 1 mm/day, 11. 1 mm/day and 1. 7 mm/day for Imbali Yamadlenya FA, Nxutsamlo FA and Ziyanhle FA respectively. The observed basic infiltration rates for Nxutsamlo, Ziyanhle and Imbali Yamadlenya irrigation schemes were 19. 8 mm/h, 31. 8 mm/hr and 10. 2 mm/hr respectively which meant the soil could absorb water from the sprinklers without experiencing surface runoff. The calculated CUs for Nxutsamlo FA, Ziyanhle FA and Imbali Yamadlenya FA were 55 %, 45 % and 70 % respectively while the DUs calculated were 33. 3 %, 50 % and 60 % for all the schemes respectively. The project management need to develop technical interventions for capacity building of the smallholder farmers to better manage their irrigation schemes in order to achieve the projectâ€™s goal of reducing poverty and improving their livelihoods and that of their communities.,WaterNe...|$|E
40|$|Estimating {{evaporation}} {{is important}} when managing water resources and cultivating crops. Evaporation {{can be estimated}} using land surface heat flux models and remotely sensed land surface temperatures (LST), which have recently become obtainable in very high resolution using lightweight thermal cameras and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). In this study a thermal camera was mounted on a UAV and applied into the field of heat fluxes and hydrology by concatenating thermal images into mosaics of LST and using these as input for the two-source energy balance (TSEB) modelling scheme. Thermal images are obtained with a fixed-wing UAV overflying a barley field in western Denmark {{during the growing season}} of 2014 and a spatial resolution of 0. 20  m is obtained in final LST mosaics. Two models are used: the original TSEB model (TSEB-PT) and a dual-temperature-difference (DTD) model. In contrast to the TSEB-PT model, the DTD model accounts for the bias that is likely present in remotely sensed LST. TSEB-PT and DTD have already been well tested, however only during sunny weather conditions and with satellite images serving as thermal input. The aim {{of this study is to}} assess whether a lightweight thermal camera mounted on a UAV is able to provide data of sufficient quality to constitute as model input and thus attain accurate and high spatial and temporal resolution surface energy heat fluxes, with special focus on latent heat flux (evaporation). Furthermore, this study evaluates the performance of the TSEB scheme during cloudy and overcast weather conditions, which is feasible due to the low data retrieval altitude (due to low UAV flying altitude) compared to satellite thermal data that are only available during clear-sky conditions. TSEB-PT and DTD fluxes are compared and validated against eddy covariance measurements and the comparison shows that both TSEB-PT and DTD simulations are in good agreement with eddy covariance measurements, with DTD obtaining the best results. The DTD model provides results comparable to studies estimating evaporation with similar experimental setups, but with LST retrieved from satellites instead of a UAV. Further, <b>systematic</b> <b>irrigation</b> patterns on the barley field provide confidence in the veracity of the spatially distributed evaporation revealed by model output maps. Lastly, this study outlines and discusses the thermal UAV image processing that results in mosaics suited for model input. This study shows that the UAV platform and the lightweight thermal camera provide high spatial and temporal resolution data valid for model input and for other potential applications requiring high-resolution and consistent LST...|$|E
30|$|Based on our data, {{prevention}} of MRONJ is optimal because its management is quite challenging. While some case reports have demonstrated surgical treatment with good outcomes, generally, aggressive surgery has been counterproductive, often exacerbating the bone exposure [24]. Hence, most publicized {{studies suggest that}} initial treatment (stage I, II) should be conservative, focusing on <b>systematic</b> antibiotic therapy, <b>irrigation</b> to optimize oral hygiene, and careful removal of sequesters [10, 17, 25]. However, only 23 – 53 % of all patients achieve resolution of mucosal discontinuities [26, 27]. Bamias et al. [7] demonstrated that antibiotic therapy resulted in temporary improvement, but only one patient showed sustained improvement of their osteonecrosis after multiple courses of antibiotics. The remaining 11 MM patients with MRONJ had persistent disability, mainly experiencing recurrence with purulent discharge and pain after discontinuing their antibiotics. These results coincide well with ours. In this present study, after conservative treatment as recommended by the AAOMS, the majority of stage II patients has been improved and was reclassified as stage I, but all patients remained with unhealed exposed bone at the follow-up appointment.|$|R
40|$|Contrary to Asian countries, the {{agricultural}} sector in Africa had not benefited from the green revolution success. After a long time of disinterest in the agriculture sector in Africa, several voices arise now in favour of greater efforts towards this sector. Several studies tend to show the crucial role of agriculture in African countries' growth and highlight the huge need of increasing the productivity in this sector. If increase in agriculture productivity requires both an expansion of irrigated areas and the adoption of high yield varieties, those innovations and their high development could {{be the source of}} negative health (and environmental) effects. Using a mega-analysis, this paper highlights first the links between health, disease and development and then agricultural productivity. The literature review shows that the negative effect of bad health was not systematically checked, and that the intensity of this effect depends of the disease, but also of the work productivity and the existence or not of a coping process. The second part of the paper focused on the development of high intensive agriculture as a risk factor for farmers' and rural inhabitants' health. This survey shows that whether irrigation and fertilizer and pest intensive use could be considered as highly health (and environmental) risk factors, appropriate control measures (such as for examples <b>systematic</b> maintenance of <b>irrigation</b> canals, alternate wetting and drying of irrigated fields or integrated pest management) considerably reduce this risk, while at the same time, increase the agriculture productivity. agriculture;productivity;endemic disease;health risk factor;Africa...|$|R

Referring to typical Mediterranean climate conditions and assuming a <b>systematic</b> <b>irrigation</b> use of brackish groundwater, this paper analyzes the capability of yearly rainfall, particularly in fall-winter period, to leach the salts accumulated in the soil during the previous spring-summer irrigation season. The leaching capability of water supplies exceeding the soil water holding capacity has undergone direct evaluation through a particular experimental arrangement: under a rain shelter, soil columns (inside special cylindrical containers), previously salinized and bare at the surface, were treated with repeated irrigations. Fresh water was used for this purpose, in order to simulate rainwater. The amounts and proportions of salt removed from the soil {{as well as the}} relative quantity of salt left in the soil were monitored. An appropriate statistical data analysis led to the interpretation of the observed process by developing a leaching curve able to predict the fraction of salts remaining along the soil profile according to the height of leaching water added to the soil, expressed as a fraction of the depth of the soil layer considered. According to the experimentally determined “leaching curve” (related to a silt-loam textured soil, basically unstructured and compacted {{as a result of a}} prolonged salinization), the following rule of thumb can be taken: the application of a defined height of leaching fresh water reduces by 70 % (i. e. reduces to 30 %) the salt content of a soil layer of equal depth. The elaboration of this conveniently parameterized “leaching curve” prompted an attempt to extend what had been experimentally observed to a larger time and spatial scale. Therefore, different scenarios were elaborated, regarding soil salinity in relation to particular hypotheses of irrigation management and crop rotation aimed, respectively, at promoting salt leaching and minimize salt load into the soil. This has been done on the basis of historical rain-gauge series reported by the Foggia weather observatory, with reference to the years 1951 - 2000. Very critical scenarios follow from the performed simulations. If only brackish groundwater is used for irrigation, the annual cultivation of a spring-summer irrigated crop without any additional leaching (apart from rain) leads to a saline buildup. This compromises agricultural soil quality. Therefore, a recommended technical choice is the cultivation of irrigated summer crops not more than once every two years. At the same time, a limited (100 - 200 mm) but influential fresh water applications for leaching purposes could be usefully associated...|$|E
