The analysis covers social, economic and financial pertinent indicators and uses the latest statistic database. Even that the Romanian government adopted the Updated Convergence Program 2009 - 2012, the forecasts are not too optimistic for the economy. The main conclusion of the paper is that to adopt radical measures, <b>staring</b> <b>by</b> the top of macroeconomic management and politicians, not by the bottom. global crisis, globalization, foreign financing...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} years, {{there has been}} a growing {{scientific}} and commercial interest in the area of fish welfare. The current EU legislation does not provide specific requirements in terms of the methods and procedures for stunning and killing fish. This is mainly due to the insufficient data clarifying the nervous activity of fish and their ability to experience pain and fear. Mechanism of stress in fish is very similar to that in mammals and birds, <b>staring</b> <b>by</b> a number of neuroendocrine and metabolic reactions. The changes occurring as a result of stress are highly dependent on the intensity and duration of the stress factor. In this line, {{it is important to note}} that some of the commonly used methods for stunning and killing fish may be followed by an extreme stress reaction and vigorous muscle activity shortly before death. As a result, stressed fish may exhibit altered postmortem muscle metabolism and impaired meat quality, manifested by changes similar to “pale, soft, exudative meat” (PSE), typical for pork and turkey meat. Furthermore, stress in fish often leads to alterations in growth, immunity and disease resistance. Some experiments demonstrate that even short-acting stress factors can affect the normal immunity and thus, may enable the proliferation of some typical fish pathogens. Nonetheless, there is still no data clarifying the potential effect of stress in fish contaminated with bacterial pathogens that cause foodborne infections in humans. In this line, we performed one of the first experiments, including experimental infections of fish with important foodborne pathogens, such as Salmonella Enteritidis and Listeria monocytogenes. Although they are not typical representatives of the fish microflora, these bacteria may present an enormous risk to the fish meat safety, especially if they are able to reach the “sterile” tissues of fish. In conclusion, fish welfare during stunning and slaughter is a scientific area that requires extensive and thorough studies. The present scientific opinion could be a step in clarifying the problem by focusing on three main topics – development of recommendations on fish welfare during slaughter, obtaining meat with high quality and investigating the influence of stress on the ability of some important foodborne pathogens to penetrate and persist in the tissues of live fish. Keywords: fish welfare, stunning, slaughter, fish meat quality and safet...|$|E
