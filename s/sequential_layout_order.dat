40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} during the rainy period in six semi-intensive production fish ponds in which water flowed from one pond to another without undergoing any treatment. Eight sampling sites were assigned at pond outlets during the rainy period (December-February). Lowest and highest physical and chemical parameters of water occurred in pond P 1 (a site near the springs) and in pond P 4 (a critical site that received allochthonous material from the other ponds and also from frog culture ponds), respectively. Pond <b>sequential</b> <b>layout</b> caused concentration of nutrients, chlorophyll-a and conductivity. Seasonal rains increased the water flow in the ponds and, consequently, silted more particles and other dissolved material from one fish pond to another. Silting increased limnological variables from P 3 to P 6. Although results suggest that during the period under analysis, rainfall affected positively the ponds' water quality and since the analyzed systems have been aligned in a <b>sequential</b> <b>layout</b> with constant water flow from fish ponds and parallel tanks without any previous treatment, care {{has to be taken}} so that an increase in rain-induced water flow does not have a contrary effect in the fish ponds investigated...|$|R

50|$|As {{an example}} of how XRATE is used, {{consider}} a protein-coding gene consisting of exons interspersed with introns. The exons contain triplets of nucleotides (codons) that are translated by ribosomes according to the genetic code, and consequently are under selection pressure (since any mutation may affect the translated amino acid sequence). In contrast, the introns are under fewer selective constraints and tend to evolve faster. These varying pressures show up clearly in multiple alignments.The <b>sequential</b> <b>layout</b> of introns and exons can be described using grammar theory (from linguistics) and each of their distinct evolutionary signatures modeled as a continuous-time Markov process.XRATE allows the user to specify such models in a configuration file and estimate their parameters (evolutionary rates, length distributions of exons and introns, etc.) directly from alignment data, using the Expectation-maximization algorithm.|$|R

In this paper, we explore alternate native strategies for storing semi-structured data that match its access characteristics to those of disk drives, using XML data as a concrete case study. In particular, we present algorithms that, given semi-structured data and a disk drive, decide how to store the data on the drive {{in a way that will}} later allow efficient navigation and retrieval. We evaluate our proposed methods using the DiskSim disk simulator and benchmark XPath queries.

Therefore, the investigation of various alternatives to improve the performance of VOD servers has become a major research focus. The reduction of disk access time through intelligent data placement strategies is one such avenue and is the theme of this paper. Movie rental patterns indicate that accesses to movies are highly localized, with only a small number of movies receiving most of the accesses. In this paper, we exploit the access patterns and propose an adaptive rearrangement of the blocks on each disk within the server. With this approach, the blocks of the movies with comparable access frequencies are kept closer to each other. We analyze two rearrangement schemes, called centered and sequential. In the centered layout, blocks are placed according to their access patterns starting with the most popular movie at the center. The <b>sequential</b> <b>layout</b> places movies in the order of their popularity starting at the edge of the disk. We compare and evaluate, through an intensive simulation study, the effectiveness of these layouts with respect to arbitrary layouts. The simulation results indicate that significant disk improvements could be attained by adopting the proposed schemes, and that the centered layout is the best performer. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract⎯In this paper, {{issues of}} storage <b>layout</b> and <b>order</b> picking {{operations}} problems for warehousing are addressed using optimization techniques. The {{aim of this}} study is to develop a dynamic planning system applied for storage layout and order-picking operations problems. The planning system considers dynamic nature of customer order demand, configuration of picking area, and interactive human-machine interface. Heuristic-based optimization technique is utilized to design the planning system. To analyze the dynamic nature of customer order demand, similarity measures among types of items are defined using the entry-order-quantity rule. Based on the characteristics of customer order demand and the configuration of picking area, a zero-one quadratic generalized assignment model is developed. A heuristic procedure is devised to find near-optimal solutions to this problem and coded using Borland C++ computer language. An industrial size application is performed to demonstrate this approach. Results indicate that the developed planning system can be promising for dealing with storage <b>layout</b> and <b>order</b> picking operations problems for warehousing.

40|$|Significant {{progress}} has been made toward all of the goals for {{the first phase of the}} project short of actual fabrication of a light path. Two alternative approaches to fabricating gold mirrors using the basic LIGA process were developed, one using electroplated solid gold mirrors and the second using gold plated over a nickel base. A new method of fabrication, the transfer mask process, was developed and demonstrated. Analysis of the projected surface roughness and beam divergence effects was completed. With gold surface with low surface roughness scattering losses are expected to be insignificant. Beam divergence due to diffraction will require a modification of the original design, but should be eliminated by fabricating mirrors 1000 mu m in height by 1000 mu m in width and using a source with an initial beam radius greater than 300 mu m. This may eliminate any need for focusing optics.
