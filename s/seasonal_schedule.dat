25|$|The renovated line {{encountered}} many problems, {{particularly in}} the Beit Shemesh–Jerusalem section, and was not considered economically viable. It also cost NIS 540 million to build, instead of the planned NIS 330 mln. The winding nature of the mountainous, 19th-century era route between Beit Shemesh and Jerusalem, while scenic, restricts trains' speed and type, and Malha station's location within Jerusalem is not considered ideal, being situated in the town's southern outskirts. In late 2006, a decision was passed down to split the service on the line into two—Tel Aviv – Beit Shemesh, and Beit Shemesh – Jerusalem (taking effect on December 30). This improved conditions and timetable reliability in the first section, which a variety of train types could now traverse, but significantly increased the time between Jerusalem and destinations other than Beit Shemesh, and the line was re-united in the following <b>seasonal</b> <b>schedule.</b> The rebuilding process itself was also criticized, because a number of historic structures were destroyed, including the original Beit Shemesh and Bittir stations, and a stone bridge.|$|E

For Caboose trips and at-the-throttle trips, the museum has leased engines from the Grambling Locomotive Works. The Virginia Museum of Transportation and Norfolk Southern previously allowed the museum to use the #611 during its two stays. Tickets can purchased to ride the roundhouse turntable.|$|E
