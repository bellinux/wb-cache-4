25|$|<b>Stylistics</b> {{arising from}} Internet usage has spread beyond {{the new media}} into other areas and platforms, {{including}} but not limited to, films, music and literary works. The infiltration of Internet <b>stylistics</b> is important as mass audiences {{are exposed to the}} works, reinforcing certain Internet specific language styles which may not be acceptable in standard or more formal forms of language.|$|E

25|$|<b>Stylistics</b> is {{the study}} and {{interpretation}} of texts for aspects of their linguistic and tonal style. Stylistic analysis entails the analysis of description of particular dialects and registers used by speech communities. Stylistic features include rhetoric, diction, stress, satire, irony, dialogue, {{and other forms of}} phonetic variations. Stylistic analysis can also include the study of language in canonical works of literature, popular fiction, news, advertisements, and other forms of communication in popular culture as well. It is usually seen as a variation in communication that changes from speaker to speaker and community to community. In short, <b>Stylistics</b> is the interpretation of text.|$|E
25|$|Stylistic {{diffusion}} – It {{involves the}} study of the spread of Internet jargons and related linguistic forms into common usage. As language changes, conversation discourse and stylistic diffusion overlap with the aspect of language <b>stylistics.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{dimensions}} {{covered in}} this section include looking at the Web as a corpus and issues of language identification and normalization. The impacts of internet linguistics on everyday life are examined under the spread and influence of Internet <b>stylistics,</b> trends of language change on the Internet and conversation discourse.|$|E
25|$|Based {{primarily}} in the Philadelphia International record label, Philadelphia soul (or Philly Soul) had a lush orchestral sound and doo-wop-inspired vocals. Thom Bell, and Kenneth Gamble & Leon Huff are considered the founders of Philadelphia soul, which produced hits for The O'Jays, The Intruders, The Delfonics, The <b>Stylistics,</b> Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes, and The Spinners.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} popular Internet-related {{technologies}} to be studied under this perspective is e-mail, which has expanded the <b>stylistics</b> of languages in many ways. A study done on the linguistic profile of e-mails has shown that there is a hybrid of speech and writing styles in terms of format, grammar and style. E-mail is rapidly replacing traditional letter-writing because of its convenience, speed and spontaneity. It is often related to informality as it feels temporary and can be deleted easily. However, as this medium of communication matures, e-mail is no longer confined to sending informal messages between friends and relatives. Instead, business correspondences are increasingly being carried out through e-mails. Job seekers are also using e-mails to send their resumes to potential employers. The result of a move towards more formal usages will be a medium representing a range of formal and informal <b>stylistics.</b>|$|E
25|$|Also, the {{interaction}} between English and other languages is predicted {{to be an important}} area of study. As global users interact with each other, possible references to different languages may continue to increase, resulting in formation of new Internet <b>stylistics</b> that spans across languages. Chinese and Korean languages have already experienced English language's infiltration leading to the formation of their multilingual Internet lingo.|$|E
25|$|Her {{mother would}} later remarry to Walt Kurczeski, whom Carlisle says was an alcoholic, {{and with whom}} she had a tumultuous relationship. The family moved {{frequently}} during her childhood, from Simi Valley to Reseda, before settling in Burbank when Carlisle was seven years old. At age ten, Carlisle began to express interest in music, and recalled The Beach Boys, Cat Stevens, The <b>Stylistics,</b> and The Animals as being early musical influences.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the use of}} the Internet {{resulted}} in <b>stylistics</b> that are not deemed appropriate in academic and formal language use, it is to be noted that Internet use may not hinder language education but instead aid it. The Internet has proven in different ways that it can provide potential benefits in enhancing language learning, especially in second or foreign language learning. Language education through the Internet in relation to Internet linguisitics is, most significantly, applied through the communication aspect (use of e-mails, discussion forums, chat messengers, blogs, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Mohammad Taghi Bahar's main {{contribution}} to this field is his book called Sabk Shenasi (<b>Stylistics).</b> It is a pioneering work on the practice of Persian literary historiography and the emergence and development of Persian literature as a distinct institution {{in the early part}} of the 20th century. It contends that the exemplary status of Sabk-shinasi rests on the recognition of its disciplinary or institutional achievements. It further contends that, rather than a text on Persian ‘stylistics’, Sabk-shinasi is a vast history of Persian literary prose, and, as such, is a significant intervention in Persian literary historiography.|$|E
25|$|In {{any case}} {{it would be}} an error to read the Satires as a literal account of normal Roman life and thought in the late first and early second centuries AD, just as {{it would be an}} error to give {{credence}} to every slander recorded in Tacitus or Suetonius against the members of prior imperial dynasties. Themes {{similar to those of the}} Satires are present in authors spanning the period of the late Roman Republic and early empire ranging from Cicero and Catullus to Martial and Tacitus; similarly, the <b>stylistics</b> of Juvenal’s text fall within the range of post-Augustan literature, as represented by Persius, Statius, and Petronius.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} arts venues. Foremost is the Fairfield Halls, opened in 1962, which {{consists}} of a large concert hall frequently used for BBC recordings, the Ashcroft Theatre and the Arnhem Gallery. Fairfield {{is the home of}} the London Mozart Players. Many famous faces have appeared at the Fairfield Halls, including The Beatles, Bucks Fizz, Omid Djalili, Robert Cray, JLS, Chuck Berry, BB King, Don McLean, The Monkees, Johnny Cash, Dionne Warwick, Gladys Knight, Morecambe and Wise, Tom Jones, The <b>Stylistics,</b> Status Quo, Level 42, A-HA, John Mayall, Jools Holland, Kenny Rogers, James Last, and Coolio. The main concert hall was used for the conference scene in the Ron Howard film The Da Vinci Code (2006).|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} Internet {{linguistics}} can be effectively done through four main perspectives: sociolinguistics, education, <b>stylistics</b> and applied. Further dimensions have {{developed as a}} result of further technological advancements which include the development of the Web as Corpus and the spread and influence of the stylistic variations brought forth by the spread of the Internet, through the Mass Media and Literary Works. In view of the increasing number of users connected to the Internet, the linguistics future of the Internet remains to be determined as new computer-mediated technologies continue to emerge and people adapt their languages to suit these new media. The Internet continues to {{play a significant role in}} both encouraging as well as diverting attention away from the usage of languages.|$|E
25|$|<b>Stylistics</b> also {{involves}} {{the study of}} written, signed, or spoken discourse through varying speech communities, genres, and editorial or narrative formats in the mass media. In the 1960s, Jacques Derrida, for instance, further distinguished between speech and writing, by proposing that written language be studied as a linguistic medium of communication in itself. Palaeography is therefore the discipline that studies the evolution of written scripts (as signs and symbols) in language. The formal study of language also led {{to the growth of}} fields like psycholinguistics, which explores the representation and function of language in the mind; neurolinguistics, which studies language processing in the brain; biolinguistics, which studies the biology and evolution of language; and language acquisition, which investigates how children and adults acquire the knowledge of one or more languages.|$|E
25|$|The {{educational}} {{perspective of}} internet linguistics examines the Internet's impact on formal language use, specifically on Standard English, {{which in turn}} affects language education. The rise and rapid spread of Internet use has brought about new linguistic features specific only to the Internet platform. These include, {{but are not limited}} to, an increase in the use of informal written language, inconsistency in written styles and <b>stylistics</b> and the use of new abbreviations in Internet chats and SMS text messaging, where constraints of technology on word count contributed to the rise of new abbreviations. Such acronyms exist primarily for practical reasons — to reduce the time and effort required to communicate through these mediums apart from technological limitations. Examples of common acronyms include lol (for laughing out loud; a general expression of laughter), omg (oh my god) and gtg (got to go).|$|E
25|$|Percussionist Evelyn Glennie has {{collaborated with}} Björk {{and can be}} heard playing the marimba on Post and Telegram, as well as Oxygen. Thompson Twins {{included}} marimba in their many 1980s works. Jack White played marimba on The Nurse, a song on The White Stripes' album Get Behind Me Satan. In 2003, Marina Calzado Linage recorded an album bridging the gap between academic and popular music, Marimba de Buenos Aires, featuring music by Ástor Piazzolla. In 2009, Canadian musician Spencer Krug, working under the moniker Moonface, released a 20-minute continuous piece called Dreamland EP: Marimba And Shit-Drums with Jagjaguwar. The recording consists entirely of marimba, drums and vocals and comprises many movements and recurring themes. Vincent Montana Jr. played the marimba {{on one of the}} great socially conscious soul songs of the early 1970s People Make the World Go Round by The <b>Stylistics.</b> The experimental band Coil (band) used the marimba in its later performances such as Selvaggina, Go Back into the Woods and studio albums The Ape of Naples and Black Antlers.|$|E
25|$|By 1881, {{having been}} {{exempted}} from his compulsory {{term in the}} Romanian Land Forces as the eldest son of a widow, the young man went on to study at the University of Bucharest's Faculty of Letters. Taught and regarded with admiration by academic Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, Șăineanu was primarily a student of etymology, <b>stylistics</b> and semantics (which {{formed the basis of}} his first three studies, published in 1882 and 1887). He published his first study, the 1883 Câteva specimene de etimologie populară română ("A Few Samples of Romanian Folk Etymology"), in Hasdeu's magazine Columna lui Traian. By then, Șăineanu had begun contributing to Anuar pentru Israeliți ("The Yearbook for Israelites"), the Hebraist magazine edited by his friends and fellow scholars Moses Gaster and Moses Schwartzfeld, which mainly published articles on Jewish history and espoused a moderate assimilationist agenda (Haskalah). Gaster also sent Șăineanu's various studies on folklore and linguistics also published in Revista pentru Istorie, Arheologie și Filologie, a review founded and led by Romanian historian Grigore Tocilescu. The direct contacts between the two scholars ended in 1885, when Gaster was expelled from Romania for protesting against the antisemitic measures condoned by the National Liberal Party cabinet of Ion Brătianu.|$|E
25|$|The only {{three-dimensional}} {{depiction of}} Khufu that has survived time nearly completely {{is a small}} and well restored ivory figurine known as Khufu Statuette. It shows the king with the Red Crown of Lower Egypt. The king is seated on a throne with a short backrest, at {{the left side of}} his knees the Horus-name Medjedu is preserved, and, at the right side, the very scarce rest of the lower part of the cartouche name Khnum-Khuf is visible. Khufu holds a flail in his left hand, and his right hand rests together with the lower arm on his right upper leg. The artifact was found in 1903 by Flinders Petrie at Kom el-Sultan near Abydos. The figurine was found headless; according to Petrie, it was caused by an accident while digging. When Petrie recognized the importance of the find, he stopped all other work and offered a reward to any workman who could find the head. Three weeks later the head was found after intense sifting in a deeper level of the room rubble. Today the little statue is restored and on display in the Egyptian Museum of Cairo in room 32 under its inventory number JE 36143. Most Egyptologists believe the statuette is contemporary, but some scholars, such as Zahi Hawass, think that it was an artistic reproduction of the 26th dynasty. He argues that no building that surely dates to the 4th dynasty was ever excavated at Kom el-Sultan or Abydos. Furthermore, he points out that the face of Khufu is unusually squat and chubby and shows no emotional expression. Hawass compared the facial <b>stylistics</b> with statues of contemporary kings, such as Sneferu, Khaefra and Menkaura. The faces of these three kings are of even beauty, slender and with a kindly expression – the clear result of idealistic motivations; they are not based on reality. The appearance of Khufu on the ivory statue instead looks like the artist did not care very much about professionalism or diligence. And Khufu himself would have never allowed the display of such a comparatively sloppy work. And finally, Hawass also argues that the sort of throne the figurine sits on does not match the artistic styles of any Old Kingdom artifact. Old Kingdom thrones had a backrest that reached up to the neck of a king. But the ultimate proof that convinces Hawass about the statue being a reproduction of much later time is the Nehenekh-flail in Khufu's left hand. Depictions of a king with such a flail as a ceremonial insignia appear no earlier than during the Middle Kingdom. Zahi Hawass therefore concludes that the figurine was possibly made as an amulet or lucky charm to sell to pious citizens.|$|E

500|$|Like {{many of its}} yakuza film contemporaries, Branded to Kill {{shows the}} {{influence}} of the James Bond films and film noir, though the film's conventional genre basis was combined with satire, kabuki <b>stylistics</b> and a pop art aesthetic. It was further set apart from its peers, and Seijun Suzuki's previous films, through its gothic sensibilities, unusual atonal score and what artist and academic Philip Brophy called a [...] "heightened otherness". The result has been alternately ascribed as a work of surrealism, absurdism, the avant garde and included in the Japanese New Wave movement, though not through any stated intention of its director. Suzuki employed a wide variety of techniques and claimed his singular focus was to make the film as entertaining as possible.|$|E
