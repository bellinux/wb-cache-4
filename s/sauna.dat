5|$|In many countries, being {{identified}} {{in such a}} <b>sauna</b> was still viewed by the press as scandalous. In Ireland in November 1994, the Incognito <b>sauna</b> made mainstream press as the gay <b>sauna</b> where a priest {{had died of a}} heart attack and two other priests were on hand to help out. Scott Capurro is known for his deliberately provocative comedy material and often refers to gay sexual culture including gay bathhouses.|$|E
5|$|Bathhouses vary {{considerably}} {{in size and}} amenitiesfrom small establishments with 10 or 20 rooms {{and a handful of}} lockers to multi-story saunas with a variety of room styles or sizes and several steam baths, Jacuzzi tubs, and sometimes swimming pools. Most have a steam room (or wet <b>sauna),</b> dry <b>sauna,</b> showers, lockers, and small private rooms.|$|E
5|$|In Portchester Square is the Basingstoke Sports Centre {{which has}} a {{subterranean}} swimming pool, <b>sauna,</b> jacuzzi and steam room. Above ground there is a gym, aerobics studios, squash courts and main hall. There is also a playden for young children.|$|E
50|$|Public <b>saunas</b> {{are mixed}} gender in the Netherlands and Flanders. Some <b>saunas</b> have a regular women-only (part of the) day. There are some <b>saunas</b> {{that have a}} minimum age limit between 12 and 16 on some or all days. There {{is a very small}} amount of <b>saunas,</b> mainly in North Holland, that are men-only, though these have usual a sexual setting, where as regular public <b>saunas</b> are per {{definition}} non-sexual.|$|R
50|$|It {{is common}} for people to visit the public <b>saunas</b> with their partner or friends, or with family members like (grand)parents, (grand)children, {{brothers}} and sisters. People might also visit <b>saunas</b> on their own. People of all ages visit the <b>saunas</b> {{and there is no}} emphasis placed on gender, age, body shape, disability, tattoos, or body hair.|$|R
50|$|Swedish <b>saunas</b> can {{be found}} all along the waterfront. <b>Saunas</b> are very popular in Sweden to sweat out {{impurities}} then jump in the ice cold lake water.|$|R
5|$|The {{silver birch}} is Finland's {{national}} tree. Leafy, fragrant boughs of silver birch (called vihta or vasta) {{are used to}} gently beat oneself in the Finnish <b>sauna</b> culture.|$|E
5|$|There is a bowls club {{situated}} at the Memorial Park. Keynsham leisure centre was built in 1965 by British Gas {{as a gift to}} the town. It includes a swimming pool, gymnasium and <b>sauna.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Britain gay saunas were {{routinely}} raided by police {{up until the}} end of the 1980s (for example raids in May 1988 on Brownies in Streatham, the owner getting a six-month jail sentence and a £5,000 fine, and the Brooklyn House Hotel <b>sauna</b> in Manchester). By the 1990s, with increasing scrutiny of the costs of such operations (charges of gross indecency in a <b>sauna</b> normally needing the expense of undercover officers), a reduced likelihood of successful prosecution, concerns of being perceived as homophobic, and little public interest in victimless crime, gay saunas became free to operate without the risk of being raided by police. Also, police attitudes meant that they were more willing to turn a blind eye because they preferred such activity to take place in a contained environment rather than outdoors even though users were still committing the homosexual sexual offence of gross indecency, until gross indecency was wiped from the statute books following the Sexual Offences Act 2003.|$|E
50|$|The main {{division}} of <b>saunas</b> is between once warmed and continuously warmed stoves. All smoke <b>saunas</b> are once warmed, {{but there are}} also other type of ovens that are once warmed.|$|R
50|$|There {{is today}} a 25 meter {{exercise}} and fitness pool, pools {{for children and}} toddlers, <b>saunas</b> and spas. The 3rd floor contains a wellness unit with an ice water pool, <b>saunas,</b> spa baths and massage pools.|$|R
50|$|Also most {{wellness}} centres have on offer {{healthy and}} balanced food. In addition, {{an increasing number}} of <b>saunas</b> are also meeting the needs of their customers for sustainable <b>saunas,</b> offering a back-to-nature experience with ‘natural’ and ‘organic’ treatments or facilities.|$|R

5|$|On 30 November 1974, an {{assassination}} attempt was made on Kiep, during which a man fired three shots {{at the door of}} his <b>sauna,</b> though he remained uninjured. The assassin was never found and leads hinting towards involvement of the Red Army Faction proved inconclusive. As the German magazine Der Spiegel wrote a year later, some party colleagues allegedly considered it possible that Kiep had staged the attack himself.|$|E
5|$|Bathhouses are {{not always}} {{identifiable}} as such from the outside. Some bathhouses are clearly marked and well lit, others have no marking other than a street address on the door. Bathhouses sometimes display the rainbow flag, which is commonly flown by businesses to identify themselves as gay-run or gay-friendly. Bathhouses commonly advertise widely in the gay press and sometimes advertise in mainstream newspapers and other media. In 2003 Australia began airing possibly the world's first television advertisements for a gay bathhouse when advertisements on commercial television in Melbourne promoted Wet on Wellington, a <b>sauna</b> in Wellington Street, Collingwood.|$|E
50|$|During the Reformation in Scandinavia the {{popularity}} of <b>saunas</b> expanded to other countries because the European bath houses were being destroyed. Hundreds of years ago, when bathing was something to be done only rarely or never at all, Finns were cleaning themselves in <b>saunas</b> {{at least once a}} week.|$|R
50|$|The first {{mention of}} hanjeungmak, {{initially}} {{referred to as}} Hanjeungso(한증소; 汗蒸所), {{is found in the}} Annals of Sejong in the 15th century. The record also state that the Korean kiln <b>saunas</b> were used for medicinal purposes. At that time, hanjeungmaks were state-supported kiln <b>saunas</b> maintained by Buddhist monks. Since 1429, the <b>saunas</b> were constructed separating facilities for men and women. There are a picture painted by Kim Jun geun in the 19th century depicting a hanjeungmak and its circular wall made from bricks accompanied by a bath house.|$|R
50|$|Extra {{facilities}} that some <b>saunas</b> might offer are natural lakes, salt water baths, cold rooms or snow rooms, mud baths, infrared heating or whirlpools. Some {{of the largest}} <b>saunas</b> may also have theatrical or sport facilities, hairdressers, manicure, pedicure, waxing, tanning beds, physiotherapy, boutiques, hotel rooms, meeting rooms or a library.|$|R
5|$|Borchgrevink was not {{a trained}} scientist, and his {{incompetence}} with equipment and inability to make simple observations were reportedly of great concern {{to some of the}} party. However, a programme of scientific observations was maintained, exercise was taken outside the hut when the weather permitted, and as a further diversion Savio improvised a <b>sauna</b> in the snowdrifts alongside the hut. A concert was arranged, including lantern slides, songs and readings. During this time there were two near-fatal incidents; in the first, a candle left burning beside a bunk set fire to the hut and caused extensive damage. In the second, three of the party were nearly asphyxiated by coal fire fumes as they slept.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s and 1970s, gay bathhousesnow {{primarily}} gay-owned and operatedbecame fully licensed gay establishments which soon became major gay institutions. These bathhouses served as informal gay meeting places, places where friends could meet and relax. Gay bathhouses frequently threw parties for Pride Day and were usually open, and busy, on public holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmas, when some gay men, {{particularly those who}} had been rejected by their families due to their sexual orientation, had nowhere else to go. The American writer Truman Capote was a regular at New York City baths in the 1970s, in particular the <b>sauna</b> at West 58th Street.|$|E
5|$|Knightstone Island {{housed a}} theatre, {{swimming}} pool and <b>sauna,</b> after having been purchased by the physician Edward Long Fox in 1830 to create a therapeutic spa with range of hot, cold and chemical baths. After years of disrepair and dereliction, the area has been redeveloped by Redrow Homes. During 2006/2007, luxury apartments and commercial outlets have been built on the site. Consideration has been taken due to the listed building status {{of much of the}} site. Boat trips from here include the Waverley and Balmoral and trips to Steep Holm and Flat Holm islands as well as short trips around Weston Bay.|$|E

5|$|Unlike many celebrities Sheldon has met, James Earl Jones welcomes his company, {{and the two}} {{spend the}} night doing various activities; they go to an ice-cream parlor, a carnival, a strip club, and a <b>sauna.</b> Sheldon asks Jones {{questions}} about himself and he confirms that he was functionally mute for eight years, he was a pre-med in college, and that sound designer Ben Burtt used scuba equipment to create the sound of Darth Vader's breathing. They also sing at a karaoke club and prank Carrie Fisher by knocking on her door and running away. At {{the end of the}} night, James Earl Jones learns that Sheldon and his friends failed to get Comic-Con tickets and invites them along as his guests.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people who}} stay at Glastonbury Festival camp in a tent. There are {{different}} camping areas, {{each with its}} own atmosphere. Limekilns and Hitchin Hill Ground are quieter camping areas, whereas Pennard Hill Ground is a lively campsite. Cockmill Meadow is a family campsite and Wicket Ground was introduced in 2011 as a second family-only campsite. A disabled campsite is also available in Spring Ground. Campsite accommodation is provided in the cost of a standard entry ticket but festival-goers must bring their own tents. Tipis have been at the festival for many years. A limited number of fixed tipis are available for hire at the tipi field near the stone circle. Up to six adults can stay in each tipi and each one comes with a groundsheet and raincatcher. Internal bedding and camping equipment is not provided. Tipi Park also offers solar showers and a log-fired yurt <b>sauna</b> to cap off the experience.|$|E
5|$|The International Zone {{served as}} {{the hub of the}} Games Village, {{offering}} retail and entertainment services as well as a rendezvous location for visitors and Games participants. Key facilities such as a bank, post office and general store were hosted there, alongside retail shops and entertainment facilities including a cinema and an Internet café. Live craft demonstrations, band performances and cultural programmes were also held at the Village. The Training Area, a zonal area by itself with an area of , provided training facilities entirely within the Games Village, in what {{has been described as a}} first in the history of the Commonwealth Games. There were facilities for four sports, including a track and field, wrestling and weightlifting training halls and an Olympic-size pool. A fully equipped gymnasium and fitness centre, steam and <b>sauna</b> facilities, physiotherapy rooms, as well as a leisure pool complemented the sport-specific facilities.|$|E

25|$|The <b>sauna,</b> {{originating}} from Finland, is attended nude in its source {{country as well}} as in most Scandinavian and in the German-speaking countries of Europe. This is true even when a swimsuit must be worn in the swimming pool area of the same complex. Saunas are very common in modern Finland, where there is one <b>sauna</b> for every three people and became very popular in the remainder of Europe in recent decades. German soldiers had got to know the Finnish saunas during their fight against the Soviet Union in the Continuation War, where Germany and Finland fought on the same side. Finnish hygiene depended so exclusively on saunas, that they had built saunas not only in mobile tents but even in bunkers.. After the war, the German soldiers brought the habit back to Germany and Austria, where it became popular {{in the second half of}} the 20th century. The German <b>sauna</b> culture also became popular in neighbouring contries such as Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxemburg. In contrast to Scandinavia, public <b>sauna</b> facilities in these countries commonly do not seggregate genders while still keeping the rule of general nudity.|$|E
