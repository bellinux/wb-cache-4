50|$|Money {{brought into}} Tajikistan’s {{education}} sector by external agencies afforded these agencies influence, {{and this has}} often brought them into discord with local authorities and educators. This is highlighted in the selection and production of textbooks. Further, education policies adopted in Central Asia {{that are part of}} the “Western reform agenda” have often been “hijacked” by policy-makers and “used for their own purposes nationally”.International organisations have often failed to involve local Tajik education stakeholders in education policy development, claiming that local policymakers lack the skills to make good policy. Because Tajikistan lacks the institutions (e.g. legal and social) necessary to ensure successful relationships between government, NGOs and international donors, the efficiency and effectiveness of NGO-led education programmes is limited. Bahry highlights the need for effective dialogue between local authorities, external donors and important stakeholders. During the Soviet era, education and the “necessities of schooling” (e.g. textbooks, travel) were provided free of charge in Tajikistan. Since independence, and the privatisation of many educational institutions, enrollment and attainment rates have suffered significantly. Many have claimed that the informal costs of education are too high, even in subsidised education, with parents often asked for donations to prop up teacher salaries and maintenance budgets. Some claim that the new democratic society has allowed more people to opt out of <b>sending</b> <b>their</b> <b>kids</b> to school. This has disadvantaged less privileged youngsters. In the Post-Soviet era, the attainment rate gap has widened between men and women, and between those living rurally and in urban settings.|$|R

It was expected to cost $3,225,000 ($51,985,157 in 2012 Dollars), and was to be built of a modified Georgian Design. The vice president of the Board at the time, Ellsworth S. Buck, called it [...] "the most beautiful educational structure in the city...establishing a high point in the city's building program." [...] It was to have shades of red brick, a gray slate roof, and a limestone trim. The school design was innovative in and of itself, where the gymnasiums and auditorium was separated from the main unit (building). This created separate gymnasiums for boys and girls, with the extended wings forming a plaza. In order to meet the conditions of the locality, it was designed to be three stories high, with a total of 10 acre allotted to it. Partly due to its lot size, an athletic field was built into the back part of the lot, with a grandstand designed for 3,000 people and a [...] "spacious" [...] field for football and track. Designed by the architect Eric Kebbon, ground was to be broken in six months, and the school was expected to open its doors in September 1940.|$|R

These results are robust across different model specifications and sample restriction. (ii) There are differences between sons and daughters and di erence across area of residence only for females. (iii) Birth order effects {{turn out to be}} nonlinear for urban and rural boys. (iv) Birth order e ects are sharpen by the number of younger sisters and younger brothers, on the one hand, and by the average birth spacing, on the other hand. (v) There is no trade-o between domestic work and schooling, but there is a trade-o ff between working and schooling except for rural girls. Finally, results also indicate that the econometric approach applied in this paper is suitable for modelling child work and school attendance for boys and girls in urban areas. However, in rural areas, it seems to be appropiate only for modelling child participation in productive work and schooling...|$|R
