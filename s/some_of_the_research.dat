5|$|Gustav {{had only}} {{effects on the}} Lesser Antilles. Large swells, light rain, and gusty winds were {{reported}} along the outer fringes of the hurricane. On August30, the Egyptian motorship Raseltin encountered rough seas in relation to Gustav, and the hull of the ship was damaged. The remnants of Gustav severely impacted a seismic research operation {{off the coast of}} the United Kingdom which took place between August25 and September12. The purpose of the operation was to collect seismic reflection profiles of the Rockfall Plateau. On September3, the members of the team had to quickly retrieve all buoys that were deployed to avoid damage to the sensors. However, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> tools were damaged before they were recovered. In all, the storm delayed the project by two days.|$|E
5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> David {{undertook}} for English Bread and Yeast Cookery {{was done}} with Jill Norman, her friend and publisher. The pair decided that they should produce two further books: Ice and Ices {{and a collection of}} David's early journalism. Like her book on bread, the scope for Ice and Ices grew the more David researched the subject. The compilation of existing essays and press articles took less time, and in 1984 An Omelette and a Glass of Wine was published, edited by Norman who became David's literary executor and edited further David works after the author's death.|$|E

5|$|The prologue to {{the novel}} is Carpentier’s most often quoted text, in which he coins the term lo real maravilloso ("marvellous reality") in {{reference}} to seemingly miraculous occurrences in Latin America.

Furthermore, his trip to Haiti in 1943 is recounted, as well as <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> he did to gather facts for the novel. Carpentier also denounces the commonplace and formulaic instances of the marvellous that is found in surrealist novels due to its inorganic and false origins, as opposed to the natural magic that is found in Latin America.|$|E

25|$|Mary Lefkowitz has criticised this research. She {{suggests}} that <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> was done not {{to determine the}} reliability of the dating method, as was suggested, but to back up an assumption of age and to make certain points about pyramids and Greek civilization. She notes that not only are the results not very precise, but that other structures mentioned in the research are not in fact pyramids, e.g. a tomb alleged to be the tomb of Amphion and Zethus near Thebes, a structure at Stylidha (Thessaly) which is just a long wall, etc. She also notes the possibility that the stones that were dated might have been recycled from earlier constructions. She also notes that earlier research from the 1930s, confirmed in the 1980s by Fracchia was ignored. She argues that they undertook their research using a novel and previously untested methodology in order to confirm a predetermined theory about the age of these structures.|$|E

The report led to lobbying by the sugar industry against the recommendation, to which the WHO/FAO responded by including in the report this statement: [...] "The Consultation recognized that a population goal for free sugars of less than 10% of total energy is controversial". It also stood by its recommendation based upon its own analysis of scientific studies.

2500|$|The {{discovery}} that the palomino coat color was {{inextricably linked to}} the cream coat color was very significant.

[...] There also were known health implications of albinism in humans, and cultural prejudices; while a heroic figure such as Roy Rogers rode a golden palomino, the [...] "Albino" [...] in Mary O'Hara's Thunderhead portrayed a horse with a freakish defect. These coat colors carried vastly different cultural significance. Because the experience of breeders of palomino and buckskin horses indicated that blue-eyed cream offspring of these animals were not genetically defective, [...] <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> that took place nearly thirty years after Adalsteinsson's studies that identified the nature of cream dilution was directly supported by breed registries that had historically barred blue eyed creams.|$|E
