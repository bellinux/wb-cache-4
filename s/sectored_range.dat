Since {{interference}} {{is related}} to the capacity and performance of W-CDMA system, it is necessary to inves-tigate the interference characteristics (the mean value and the variance). Thus, the uplink capacity and the interfe-rence statistics of the sectors of the cross-shaped W-CDMA microcell have been analyzed using geometry with 17 mic-rocells. A single slope propagation model with a lognor-mal shadowing factor has been used in the analysis. The cells have been assumed to exist in city streets with high car traffic. The capacity and the interference statistics of the sectors have been studied for different <b>sector</b> <b>ranges,</b> and different side-lobe level. The results show that the ca-pacity increases with the increment of the <b>sector</b> <b>range</b> and with the reduction of the side-lobe level of the antennas used...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the {{downlink}} sector {{capacity of}} a cigar-shaped microcells using wideband code-division multiple-access (WCDMA) with soft hand-over (SHO) mode is analyzed. The two-slope propagation loss with log-normal shadowing {{is used in the}} analysis where a model of eight cigar-shaped microcells is utilized to calculate the downlink sector capacity. The performance of the downlink is studied for different sector radii, standard deviations of the shadowing and propagation exponents. It is found that, for a <b>sector</b> <b>range</b> higher than 940 m, increasing the <b>sector</b> <b>range</b> will reduce the downlink sector capacity. Also it is found that increasing the value of the propagation parameters will reduce the downlink sector capacity. In many cases, the downlink sector capacity will be code limited since the theoretical downlink sector capacity is higher than the number of codes assigned to each sector. The high theoretical downlink sector capacity is due to the low value (0. 06 – 0. 1) of the WCDMA orthogonality factor of rural zone microcells...|$|R
