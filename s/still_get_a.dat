25|$|Boxing Day is {{a holiday}} celebrated in Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and other Commonwealth countries. Boxing Day {{originated}} in England {{in the middle}} of the nineteenth century under Queen Victoria. For years in which the holiday falls on a weekend, the celebration is moved to make sure workers <b>still</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> day off (except in Canada, where it remains 26 Dec.) In the UK it is classed as a Bank Holiday.|$|E

In a 2009 interview she commented on {{the significance of the}} character to EastEnders and viewers, saying [...] "I can't believe that I'm still recognised so much as Chrissie. I <b>still</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> lot of letters about her, too. I think that she had as much of an impact as Janine (Charlie Brooks) did, which surprised me. Chrissie wasn't around for that long but she was an amazing character with an epic storyline." ...|$|E
500|$|Bond 25 began {{development}} in early 2016; Mendes stated {{he would not}} be the film's director. In October 2016, Craig stated that he may indeed return for another film, saying, [...] "As far as I'm concerned, I've got the best job in the world. I'll keep doing it as long as I <b>still</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> kick out of it. If I were to stop doing it, I would miss it terribly." [...] Sony Pictures's contract to co-produce the series with MGM and Eon expired with the release of Spectre and the distribution rights to release Bond 25 in cinemas were put up for negotiation, with MGM and Eon only offering a one-film contract. In July 2017 it was announced that the film would be released on 8 November 2019. In August 2017 Craig confirmed that he would reprise his role as Bond.|$|E

2500|$|Africa is the sunniest {{continent}} on Earth, {{especially as}} there are many perpertually sunny areas like the huge Sahara Desert. It has much greater solar resources than any other continent. Desert regions stand up as the most sunshiny while rainforests are considerably cloudier but <b>still</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> good global solar irradiation because of the proximity with the equator.|$|E
2500|$|Various {{businesses}} have commercialized fishkeeping. With {{the advent of}} large scale business operations focusing on breeding massive quantities of specimens, marine fishkeeping {{has become much more}} widespread than ever before. Perhaps the biggest disincentive to marine fishkeeping, in comparison to freshwater, is the initial setup cost. A [...] reef tank full of coral and equipment can cost in excess of $2,500 US, although a budget-minded home hobbyist could spend less than half of this and <b>still</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> satisfactory result.|$|E
2500|$|Edmond Wright is {{a philosopher}} who {{considers}} the intersubjective aspect of perception. From Locke onwards {{it had been}} normal to frame perception problems {{in terms of a}} single subject S looking at a single entity E with a property p. However, if we begin with the facts of the differences in sensory registration from person to person, coupled with the differences in the criteria we have learned for distinguishing what we together call [...] "the same" [...] things, then a problem arises of how two persons align their differences on these two levels so that they can <b>still</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> practical overlap on parts of the real about them—and, in particular, update each other about them.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2006, New Zealand coach Ricki Herbert {{suggested}} that Fallon might <b>still</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> chance to represent New Zealand at senior level. Herbert {{claimed that the}} only reason why Fallon wasn't picked was due to lack of correspondence from FIFA regarding this matter. Fallon had until he was 21 years old to get clearance from FIFA to change nationalities. [...] It found, however, that Fallon did not apply in the 2004 window to change allegiance for over-21s players. This year-long window was made available by FIFA upon introduction of a rule which allows players with dual nationality to switch their allegiance before their 21st birthday. Under this criterion Fallon could not be available for New Zealand.|$|E

A new [...] "Custom" [...] model featured either the four- or six-cylinder engine with a standard four-speed manual transmission and new vinyl bucket seats, wheel lip moldings, and other trim upgrades. Inside the Gremlin there was a revised instrument panel borrowed from the then-new 1978 Concord. The dashboard had high-level ventilation HVAC, radio switchgear within easier reach, and a flat, full-width top. The X's tape striping pattern was revised to match the 1978 Concord Sport package design, with the stripe at the lower body side and curving over the wheel lip.|$|E
2500|$|New York had {{one last}} chance {{in the top of}} the eleventh. [...] Snodgrass led off the inning by being hit by a pitch, but was then thrown out {{attempting}} to steal second. [...] After Doyle struck out, Becker drew a walk but was also thrown out on an attempted steal of second, ending the inning. [...] After the Red Sox went down in order in the bottom of the eleventh, the game was called on account of darkness tied 6–6, Boston retaining a 1–0 lead in the Series. [...] Baseball's National Commission ruled that the players would <b>still</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> share of the gross receipts from only the first four games despite the Game2 tie, a decision which caused much discontent among the players.|$|E

I was playing with the best. But after awhile you don’t care whether you win or lose because you’re <b>still</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> paycheck. I enjoyed high school and college much more."

2500|$|Cassidy (played by Kandyse McClure) - Ben's ex-girlfriend. She is a {{nurse at}} St. Vincent's Hospital who {{practices}} jiujitsu and enjoys Sue Grafton novels. Cassidy and Ben {{met in the}} maternity ward of St. Vincent's in [...] "Coming to Grips" [...] when Ben was pursuing prolific soul Jack King. After a string of dates in the hospital cafeteria, Cassidy began to ask questions, specifically about Ben's wedding ring; {{it was at that}} point that Ben came clean about his green card marriage to Sara. The three of them came to an understanding, although Cassidy would <b>still</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> little excited about being Ben's [...] "mistress". When Immigration busted Ben and Sara, Cassidy was the one who took Ben to jail, excited at the prospect that he would be single again when he got out. In [...] "The Sweet Science", Ben explains to Nina that Cassidy ditched him while he was still in jail.|$|E
2500|$|There {{have been}} some {{positive}} reviews, however. One modern critic said [...] "the story is adequately paced, the acting is engaging, and we <b>still</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> thrill seeing the Army guys empty their cartridges at the unstoppable insects." [...] Another modern reviewer found the screenplay effective, especially the beginning: [...] "As in Deadly Mantis, the complete disappearance of the victims is especially chilling, as {{is the notion of}} 150 men, women and children being devoured overnight while in their beds. This aspect is like something out of Lovecraft, although it is not exploited as well as it could have been." [...] Producer-director Bert I. Gordon said he did not care whether reviews were bad; what mattered was whether people went to see the film: [...] "The movie audience these days consists almost entirely of teenagers. Either they're naïve and go to get scared, or they're sophisticated and enjoy scoffing at the pictures. There isn't much a teenager can scoff at these days, you know." [...] Lead actor Peter Graves also felt the film worked on a certain level. [...] "I think they played OK. ... All of that was ludicrous, but there were a certain amount of people who 'bought' it and loved it." ...|$|E

"Oh, but now, Mr. Camp," [...] said Mrs. Makely, {{leaning over}} toward him, and {{speaking}} in a cosey and coaxing tone, as if he must not really keep the truth from an old friend like her, [...] "isn't it a good deal because the farmers' daughters want pianos, and the farmers' sons want buggies? I heard Professor Lumen saying, the other day, that, if the farmers were willing to work {{as they used to}} work, they could <b>still</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> good living off their farms, and that they gave up their places because they were too lazy, in many cases, to farm them properly." ...|$|E

It was plain enough that he did not like this, and he moved forward so that he might <b>still</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> view of her. Then I also moved so as to obstruct his view. He now fixed his eyes upon me, and I returned his gaze {{in such a way as}} to make him understand that while I was present he would not be allowed to annoy a lady who evidently wished to have nothing to do with him. Presently he rose and went out. It was evident that he saw that it was no use for him to continue his reprehensible conduct while I was present.|$|E
60|$|As I {{write these}} lines {{there is a}} burst of bugles in the street, and I go to my open window to see the 41st of the line march down into what may develop into a {{considerable}} battle. How I wish they could march down the Strand even as they are. How London would rise to them! Laden like donkeys, with a pile upon their backs and very often both hands full as well, they <b>still</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> swing into their march which {{it is good to}} see. They march in column of platoons, and the procession is a long one, for a French regiment is, of course, equal to three battalions. The men are shortish, very thick, burned brown in the sun, with never a smile among them--have I not said that they are going down to a grim sector?--but with faces of granite. There was a time when we talked of stiffening the French army. I am prepared to believe that our first expeditionary force was capable of stiffening any conscript army, for I do not think that a finer force ever went down to battle. But to talk about stiffening these people now would be ludicrous. You might as well stiffen the old Guard. There may be weak regiments somewhere, but I have never seen them.|$|E
