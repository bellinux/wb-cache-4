50|$|Manual aerators {{usually have}} {{two to five}} hollow tines mounted on a <b>step</b> <b>bar.</b> The {{operator}} puts {{one foot on the}} <b>step</b> <b>bar</b> and push it downward, forcing the tines to penetrate into the soil. Then he pulls the handle on the <b>step</b> <b>bar</b> upward to remove the soil cores out of the ground. By repeating the same operation, the cores left in the tines will be pushed out by the next ones. Manual aerators are much cheaper than powered ones. The trade-off is the speed. For a typical residential lawn (1/4 acre lot), it will take hours to finish. Some products also have issues with the tines becoming clogged with soil, which can slow down the operation even more. However, a well-made manual aerator offers advantages such as ease of use, selective aeration, and economy.|$|E

40|$|Thin {{films are}} a major field in the {{electrical}} and packaging industries today. They are used in applications ranging from protective sheathing to microelectronic heat sinks. One of the most under researched fields of thin films is composite thermal interfacing. Previous composite thin film research focuses on embedding vertically aligned materials into a polymer matrix to improve thermal conductivity. In this research, we focus on adding a randomly oriented aggregate, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT), to polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Randomly oriented CNTs are easier and more cost effective to manufacture than vertically aligned CNTs but should improve thermal conductivity as much as vertically aligned CNTS. Randomly oriented CNTs create comparable bridges that are {{as effective as the}} direct pathways of vertically aligned CNTs. The thin films were tested in a <b>stepped</b> <b>bar</b> apparatus that provides a constant temperature gradient across the film and <b>stepped</b> <b>bars.</b> We then easily extracted the thermal resistance and conductivity from the collected temperature data. Variables such as film thickness and CNT: PDMS weight ratio were individually varied to optimize thermal transport through the films. Ranges of CNT density and film thickness ranged between 0. 7 to 3 % and 5 to 50 µm, respectively. We found that even though randomly oriented CNTs do not provide a direct pathway for thermal energy transfer, the thermal conductivity of these films are comparable to the vertically aligned films in the full range of film thicknesses. Future research will focus on using other polymer matrices, using single-walled CNTs, and combining randomly oriented and vertically aligned CNTs...|$|R

40|$|Thermal {{interface}} materials (TIMs) {{are used}} as an aid in transporting heat away from a circuit or electronic module. Composite materials are a popular research area for TIMs because they allow the desired properties from the individual constituents to be combined. The composite selected for this study uses carbon nanotubes (CNT) as the filler and an elastomeric polymer for the matrix, specifically a multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) / polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) composite. Additionally, functionalization of the CNT may affect the composites’ thermal conductivity because of {{its effect on the}} CNT dispersion in the polymer matrix and its effect on the CNT-polymer interface. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the effect CNT functionalization has on the effective thermal conductivity of a MWCNT/PDMS composite. The three functionalization’s used in this study are unfunctionalized, functionalized with a carboxyl group, and functionalized with a hydroxyl group. Secondary objectives were to develop the initial stages of a carbon-polymer composite database and to perform an uncertainty analysis on the <b>stepped</b> <b>bar</b> apparatus used in this study. The database is to be used for visualization of data found in literature to promote data driven research. The uncertainty analysis on the <b>stepped</b> <b>bar</b> apparatus is to qualify the instrument for thermal measurements in this study Initial results showed some increase in thermal properties of the composite, but there was little difference between the thermal conductivity of the three functionalization’s because of the high level of uncertainty used early on in this study. Later results showed an increase in mechanical properties of the composite which offset any thermal advantage with use as a TIM. A stronger composite means less compression under a similar load, resulting in a thicker TIM and higher resistance. However, the mechanical and thermal properties compound to show that -OH functionalized MWCNT present better properties for a TIM than unfunctionalized and -COOH functionalized; none show better results than the polymer by itself...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{a model of}} an <b>stepped</b> <b>bar</b> with {{variable}} Cross-sections coupled with foundation by means of lumped masses and springs is studied. It is assumed {{that the process of}} vibrations in each section of the bar is described by a wave equation. The analytical tools of vibration analysis are based on nding eigenfunctions with piecewise continuous derivatives, which are orthogonal with respect to a generalized weight function. These eigenfunctions automatically satisfy the boundary conditions at the end points as well as the non-classical boundary conditions at the junctions. The solution of the problems is formulated in terms of Green function. By means of the proposed algorithm a problem of arbitrary complexity could be considered in the same terms as a single homogeneous bar. This algorithm is efcient in design of low frequency transducers. An example is given to show the practical application of the algorithm to a two-stepped transducer. Key words.

40|$|A simple {{reference}} material for establishing the minimum measurement uncertainty of optical systems for measuring 3 D surface displacement fields in deforming objects is described {{and its use}} demonstrated by employing 3 D digital image correlation as an exemplar technique. The {{reference material}} consists of a <b>stepped</b> <b>bar,</b> whose dimensions can be scaled to suit the application, {{and that can be}} clamped rigidly at its thick end to create an idealized cantilever. The cantilever was excited at resonance to generate out-of-plane displacements and, in a separate experiment, loaded statically in-plane to provide in-plane displacement fields. The displacements were measured using 3 D digital image correlation and compared to the predicted displacement fields derived from tip deflections obtained using a calibrated transducer that provided traceability to the national standard for length. The minimum measurement uncertainties were evaluated by comparing the measured and predicted displacement fields, taking account of the uncertainties in the input parameters for the predictions. It was found that the minimum measurement uncertainties were less than 3 % for the Cartesian components of displacement present during static in-plane bending and less than 3 m for out-of-plane displacements during dynamic loading. It was concluded that this reference material was more straightforward to use, more versatile and yielded comparable results relative to an earlier design...|$|R
