Each wing has a central axis, {{composed}} of three limb bones, the humerus, ulna and radius. The hand, or manus, which ancestrally was composed of five digits, is reduced to three digits (digit II, III and IV or I, II, III depending on the scheme followed), which serves as an anchor for the , one of two groups of flight feathers responsible for the wing's airfoil shape. The other set of flight feathers, behind the carpal joint on the ulna, are called the [...] The remaining feathers on the wing are known as , of which there are three sets. The wing sometimes has vestigial claws. In most species these are lost by the time the bird is adult (such as the highly visible ones used for active climbing by hoatzin chicks), but claws are retained into adulthood by the secretarybird, screamers, finfoots, ostriches, several swifts and numerous others, as a local trait, in a few specimens. Most kinds of bird wings can be grouped into four types, with some falling between two of these types: i) elliptical wings—short and rounded, having a low aspect ratio, allowing for tight maneuvering in confined spaces such as might be found in dense vegetation, which are common in forest raptors and many migratory species of passerines, and species that use a rapid take off to evade predators, such as pheasants and partridges; ii) high speed wings—short, pointed wings that when combined with a heavy wing loading and rapid wingbeats provide an energetically expensive high speed, used by the bird with the fastest wing speed, the peregrine falcon, as well as by most of the ducks and the auks who uses the shape for a different purpose, to [...] "fly" [...] underwater; iii) high aspect ratio wings—typified by low wing loading and which are far longer than they are wide, they are used for slower flight which may take the form of almost hovering (as used by kestrels, terns and nightjars) or in soaring and gliding flight, particularly the dynamic soaring used by seabirds, which takes advantage of wind <b>speed</b> <b>variation</b> at different altitudes (wind shear) above ocean waves to provide lift; and iv) soaring wings with deep slots—common in larger species of inland birds, such as eagles, vultures, pelicans, and storks, the slots {{at the end of the}} wings, between the primaries, reduce the induced drag and wingtip vortices, whilst the shorter size of the wings aids in takeoff (high aspect ratio wings require a long taxi to get airborne).|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{consider}} the problem of tracking fine-grained <b>speeds</b> <b>variations</b> of vehicles using signal strength traces from GSM enabled phones. Existing speed estimation techniques using mobile phone signals can provide longer-term speed averages but cannot track short-term <b>speed</b> <b>variations.</b> Understanding short-term <b>speed</b> <b>variations,</b> however, is important {{in a variety of}} traffic engineering applications—for example, it may help distinguish slow speeds due to traffic lights from traffic congestion when collecting real time traffic information. Usingmobilephonesinsuchapplicationsisparticularlyattractive because it can be readily obtained from a large number of vehicles. Our approach is founded on the observation that the largescale path loss and shadow fading components of signal strength readings (signal profile) obtained from the mobile phone on any given road segment appear similar over multiple trips along the same road segment except for distortions along the time axis due to <b>speed</b> <b>variations.</b> We therefore propose a speed tracking techniquethatusesaDerivative DynamicTimeWarping(DDTW) algorithm to realign a given signal profile with a known training profile from the same road. The speed tracking technique then translates the warping path (i. e., the degree of stretching and compressing needed for alignment) into an estimated speed trace. Using 6. 4 hours of GSM signal strength traces collected from a vehicle, we show that our algorithm can estimate vehicular speed with a median error of ± 5 mph compared to using a GPS and can capture significant <b>speed</b> <b>variations</b> on road segments with a precision of 68 % and a recall of 84 %.

We investigated whether smooth and continuous <b>speed</b> <b>variations</b> are considered in the extrapolation of linear self-motion towards a stationary target. The time-to-passage (TTP) estimation task consisted in presenting a simulated forward self-motion along a street at constant, increasing or decreasing velocity. After a while, the visual target appeared (e. g. a banner) before the visual stimulation ceased.

40|$|In {{brushless}} dc machines {{the current}} commutation between phases is triggered {{based on information}} of the permanent-magnet flux position. In most BLDC drives, either sensors are used to detect this flux position or a self-sensing algorithm is applied to estimate the flux position instead. Over the last decades, different techniques {{have been developed to}} detect the current commutation instants from the speed-induced back-emf signal. Several of these methods when used in open-loop speed control show <b>speed</b> <b>variations</b> at an increasing acceleration. These <b>speed</b> <b>variations</b> are often reduced by closing the speed control loop that adapts the current amplitude to generate a torque for stable speed operation. This paper studies the open-loop behaviour of back-emf based self-sensing BLDC drives and gives a criterium for which the average speed acceleration over a time period is zero. The criterium depends on the machine inertia, speed and torque and indicates the robustness of the self-sensing method against <b>speed</b> <b>variations.</b> Fulfilling the criterium reduces the burden on the speed-controller to guarantee stable speed operation.

However, even when using powerful treadmills, {{it is impossible to}} avoid belt <b>speed</b> <b>variations.</b> The objective of this paper was to demonstrate that this instantaneous treadmill speed has {{to be taken into account}} in mechanical work calculation during treadmill walking. METHODS: To do so, 11 healthy subjects participated in the study. They walked on treadmill at four different speeds: very slow (0. 3 ms(- 1)), slow (0. 8 ms(- 1)), normal (1. 4 ms(- 1)) and fast (1. 9 ms(- 1)). To compute P(Vi), the instantaneous mechanical work relatively to the instantaneous treadmill speed, we applied the work-energy theorem in a non-inertial reference frame induced by the treadmill <b>speed</b> <b>variations.</b> This value was then compared to P(V¯), i. e. the instantaneous mechanical work computed with the usual approximation of a constant treadmill speed. FINDINGS: The <b>speed</b> <b>variations</b> had an average value of 17 % for the very slow speed and around 4. 5 % for the three other and more usual <b>speeds.</b> These <b>variations</b> have a strong influence on instantaneous mechanical work. Indeed, P(V¯) is nearly null when not considering <b>speed</b> <b>variations</b> whereas P(Vi) goes up to 113 mW kg(- 1) at higher speeds. INTERPRETATION: To conclude, our work showed that the instantaneous treadmill speed has to be taken into account in mechanical work computation. This method may provide supplementary information in clinical assessments and analyses of gait. Indeed, when using the same methodology on formerly acquired data in a group of 13 hemiplegic patients, we found that if P(V¯) is not null in this impaired subjects group, P(Vi) is still 30 % higher...|$|R

Wind Turbine Systems (WTS) are especially subject to severe thermal cycling which {{may be caused by}} the wind <b>speed</b> <b>variations</b> or power grid faults. This paper proposes a control method to relieve the thermal cycling of power switching devices under severe wind <b>speed</b> <b>variations,</b> by circulating reactive power among the parallel power converters in a WTS or among the WTS’s in a wind park. The amount of reactive power is adjusted to limit the junction temperature fluctuation in the most stressed devices. The possible model-based control system for the proposed method is demonstrated, designed and simulated based on the Three-level Neutral-Point-Clamped (3 L-NPC) grid-connected converters. It is concluded that with the proposed reactive power control method, the junction temperature fluctuation in the most stressed devices of 3 L-NPC wind power inverter under severe wind <b>speed</b> <b>variations</b> can be significantly stabilized, and the reliability of the power converter can thereby be improved while the increased stress of the other devices in the same power converter and in the paralleled ones is still acceptable.
