40|$|Aim: We {{evaluated}} {{variations in}} behavior of arylsulphatase A activity (an enzyme that catabolizes sulphatides) and of <b>sulphatide</b> {{concentration in the}} placenta, cord and membranes of healthy gravidas at term pregnancy, following spontaneous birth. Methods: We extracted and biochemically determined arylsulphatase A and <b>sulphatide</b> concentration in placenta, cord and membranes (far from and close to internal uterine os) in 14 patients. Results: Activity of arylsulphatase A decreased in the cord, in membranes far from the internal uterine os, in membranes close to the internal uterine os and in the placenta. <b>Sulphatide</b> concentration was minimal in the cord and maximal in placenta, with intermediate values in the membranes. No correlation was found between arylsulphatase A activity and <b>sulphatide</b> concentration, nor among arylsulphatase A activities, nor among <b>sulphatide</b> concentrations among the different tissues. It seems that multiparity may increase and the duration of active labor may decrease arylsulphatase A activity in membranes far from the internal uterine os, while active labor duration {{does not appear to}} have any implication on <b>sulphatide</b> concentration in membranes close to the internal uterine os. Conclusions: Arylsulphatase A activities and <b>sulphatide</b> concentrations in fetal adnexa show significant differences. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|We found, {{by using}} a virus overlay assay, that {{influenza}} A virus isolates bind to <b>sulphatide</b> (HSO 3 -Gal beta 1 [...] > 1 'Cer), which has no sialic acid residue, and that the infection of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells with the human influenza virus A/Memphis/ 1 / 71 (H 3 N 2) is inhibited by <b>sulphatide.</b> A/Memphis/ 1 / 71 (H 3 N 2) causes obvious haemagglutination and low-pH haemolysis of asialoerythrocytes reconstituted with <b>sulphatide.</b> All influenza A virus isolates from the species of animals so far tested bound to <b>sulphatide.</b> The sulphatide-binding specificity of the isolates {{was different from the}} viral sialyl-linkage specificity. Influenza A virus isolates also bound to galactosyl ceramide (GalCer; Gal beta 1 [...] > 1 'Cer), as well as <b>sulphatide,</b> in the virus overlay assays. In contrast, the influenza virus did not bind to N-deacyl, a derivative of <b>sulphatide,</b> glucosyl ceramide or the other neutral glycolipids tested. These results indicate that the linkage of galactose, or sulphated galactose, to ceramide is important for viral binding...|$|E
40|$|Extraction {{of control}} human spleen {{glucocerebrosidase}} with sodium cholate and butan-l-ol reversibly inactivates the enzyme {{in terms of}} its ability to hydrolyse the water-soluble substrate 4 -methylumbelliferyl beta-D-glucopyranoside (MUGlc). The acidic brain lipid galactocerebroside 3 -sulphate (<b>sulphatide)</b> reconstitutes beta-glucosidase activity in a strongly concentration-dependent manner. In this study we show that <b>sulphatide</b> exhibits three critical micellar concentrations (CMCs) : CMC 1, 3. 72 microM; CMC 2, 22. 6 microM; CMC 3, 60. 7 microM. We designate the aggregates formed at these CMCs as primary, secondary and tertiary micelles respectively. From the results of kinetic studies performed at various <b>sulphatide</b> concentrations (0. 012 - 248 microM), we found that <b>sulphatide</b> monomers (less than 3 microM) decreased the Km (for MUGlc) of control glucocerebrosidase from 11 to 4. 6 mM, and lowered the Vmax. 2 -fold. However, secondary and tertiary micelles were required for expression of high control glucocerebrosidase activities. Glucocerebrosidase prepared from the spleen of a patient with non-neuronopathic type 1 Gaucher's disease exhibited a very low Km (2. 8 mM) {{even in the absence of}} exogenous lipid, and <b>sulphatide</b> monomers had no effect on the mutant enzyme's Km or Vmax. However, secondary or tertiary micelles markedly increased the Vmax. of the type 1 glucocerebrosidase to 60 % of the corresponding control enzyme value. In contrast, for the glucocerebrosidase of the neuronopathic type 2 case, although <b>sulphatide</b> decreased the Km from 9. 2 to 1. 7 mM, the Vmax. never reached more than 5 % that of the control enzyme, even at high concentrations of <b>sulphatide.</b> In addition, we found that secondary and tertiary <b>sulphatide</b> micelles enhanced the rate of inactivation of all three glucocerebrosidase preparations by chymotrypsin. Collectively, these results indicate the presence of two sulphatide-binding sites on glucocerebrosidase: one that enhances substrate binding, and another that enhances catalysis...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{influence}} of calcium and temperature on pure lipid (bovine brain PC, <b>sulphatides,</b> ganglioside GT 1 b), valinomycin and mixed lipid-valinomycin monolayers at the air/water interface was studied. In mixed films, evidence {{was found that}} the two components were miscible. On the other hand, at higher surface pressures, phase separation occurs in the cases of PC and <b>sulphatides.</b> Measuring the area requirement and the collapse pressure the stability of both lipid and the peptide was increased in particular due to ganglioside-valinomycin interaction. The addition of 10 − 5 M calcium into the subphase at 20 and 37 °C and surface pressures of 10 and 20 mN/m led to a condensing effect in ganglioside mixtures, with formation of aggregates as indicated also by the nearly ideal behaviour of two component monolayers...|$|R
50|$|The exact {{function}} of the Laminin G domains has remained elusive, {{and a variety of}} binding functions has been ascribed to different Laminin G modules. For example, the laminin alpha1 and alpha2 chains each have five C-terminal laminin G domains, where only domains LG4 and LG5 contain binding sites for heparin, <b>sulphatides</b> and the cell surface receptor dystroglycan. Laminin G-containing proteins appear to have a wide variety of roles in cell adhesion, signalling, migration, assembly and differentiation.|$|R

40|$|Metachromatic {{leukodystrophy}} is a lysosomal lipid storage disorder. It {{is caused}} by mutations in the gene for arylsulphatase A, an enzyme involved in the degradation of the sphingolipid 3 '-O-sulphogalactosylceramide (<b>sulphatide).</b> This membrane lipid {{can be found in}} various cell types, but in particularly high concentrations in the myelin of the nervous system. Patients suffer from progressive, finally lethal, demyelination due to accumulation of <b>sulphatide.</b> In the nervous system, lipid storage not only affects oligodendrocytes but also neurons and, in addition, leads to astrogliosis and activation of microglia. At the cellular level, lysosomal <b>sulphatide</b> storage also affects the lipid composition of myelin itself and has consequences for the amount and localization of particular myelin membrane-associated proteins. Here we review data, largely based on an arylsulphatase A knock-out mouse model of metachromatic leukodystrophy. CONCLUSION: The knock-out mouse model of metachromatic leukodystrophy has provided insights into the histopathological and cellular consequences of <b>sulphatide</b> storage. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSulphated galactocerebroside (<b>sulphatide)</b> {{has been}} {{established}} as a ligand for L-selectin and shown to trigger intracellular signals in human neutrophils. We have found that <b>sulphatide</b> activated transcription factor NF-κB in human neutrophils in a concentration-dependent manner whereas non-sulphated galactocerebroside did not demonstrate such an effect. The activation was inhibitable by pretreatment with primary monoclonal anti-L-selectin antibody (clone LAM 1 - 116). Binding of the primary antibody to L-selectin was insufficient to induce NF-κB activation but cross-linking of L-selectin with a secondary antibody was effective. α-Chymotrypsin, the agent known to shed L-selectin, activated NF-κB by itself. The response to sulphatides was inhibited by jasplakinolide, an actin-polymerising agent known to downregulate surface expression of L-selectin, FcγRIIIb, CD 43 and CD 44. Recently we have reported that <b>sulphatide</b> stimulated the attachment of human neutrophils to collagen via Mac 1 (CD 11 b/CD 18) integrin [Sud’ina et al., Biochem. J. 359 (2001) 621 – 629].

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} arylsulphatase A {{activity and}} <b>sulphatide</b> concentrations in decidua {{of women at}} 41 and 42 weeks of gestation. STUDY DESIGN: Enzyme activity and <b>sulphatide</b> concentrations were determined by biochemical procedures on samples of women at 41 and 42 weeks of gestation; thin-layer chromatography was also prepared to separate and visualize sulphatides and other lipid fractions. RESULTS: The spectrophotometric values of arylsulphatase A showed very low values at 41 weeks, which reduced to a half at 42 weeks of gestation, while values of <b>sulphatide</b> concentrations increased in 42 weeks.

40|$|The lipid {{profiles}} of the brain in four cases of Nevin-Jones syndrome are described. A loss of phosphatidyl ethanolamine was found in both white matter and cortex in two cases {{as well as a}} more general loss of lipids in the cortex in one patient; there was a normal cerebrosidesulphatide ratio in myelin. These findings indicate a general loss of myelin over a period of time. The distribution of fatty acids in cerebrosides and <b>sulphatides</b> show a slight reduction in nervonic acid (24 : 1). The findings support the view that a secondary demyelination is present...|$|R
40|$|The E-, L- and P-selectins are carbohydrate-recognizing cell-adhesion {{molecules}} mediating selective leucocyte recruitment in inflammation. The 3 ′-sialyl- and 3 ′-sulpho-oligosaccharides of Lewisx (Lex) and Lewisa (Lea) {{series are}} bound by them, but for high-avidity binding of P- and L-selectins to the glycoprotein counter-receptor known as P-selectin glycoprotein ligand, PSGL- 1, there is a requirement for sulpho-tyrosines neighbouring a sialyl-Lex glycan. The two selectins can also bind 3 -O- or 6 -O-sulphated galacto-lipids (<b>sulphatides).</b> Here we compare some features of the interactions of P- and L-selectins with a novel lipid-linked sulpho-tyrosine probe, and with the <b>sulphatides</b> and neoglycolipids of sialyl- and sulpho-Lex/Lea fuco-oligosaccharides. The sulpho-tyrosine probe is bound by both selectins. There are close similarities in the interactions of the two selectins with sulpho-tyrosine and the sulphatides; the binding is relatively resistant to chelation of calcium ions, {{in contrast to the}} absolute requirement of calcium ions with the long fuco-oligosaccharides, including 6 -sulpho-sialyl-Lex. With both selectins, there is striking synergy in binding signals elicited by the two ligand types when presented as equimolar mixtures on a matrix. Thus, there are two operationally distinct binding sites on both L- and P-selectin; and the binding sites for sulphate groups in the two ligand types are probably distinct. When sulpho-tyrosine and sialyl-Lex are presented on liposomes, a potent inhibitory activity is generated toward the binding of P-selectin to HL 60 cells, with 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC 50) values in the nanomolar range. These features of the lipid-linked ligand analogues, and the simple approach for their display on liposomes, may have applications in designs and screening of selectin inhibitors as anti-inflammatory compounds...|$|R

On clinical grounds 44 patients had a sensorimotor, 29 patients a sensory, and two patients a motor polyneuropathy. The overall clinical course in chronic idiopathic polyneuropathy was slowly progressive. None of the patients became severely disabled.

40|$|Sulphatides were assayed in {{preparations}} of frontal cortex, neostriatum and hippocampus of 6 -month-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR, {{systolic pressure}} 215 +/- 6 mmHg) and age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats (systolic pressure 143 +/- 6 mmHg) by {{thin layer chromatography}} associated with spectrophotometry and histochemistry. The volume of gray and white matter of the above areas was also measured by microanatomical techniques associated with image analysis. <b>Sulphatide</b> levels were unchanged in the frontal cortex and neostriatum and decreased in the hippocampus of SHR in comparison with WKY rats. No changes of metachromatic <b>sulphatide</b> staining {{were found in the}} different brain areas investigated of SHR, whereas a decrease of positive metachromatic areas was noticeable in the frontal cortex and neostriatum, but not in the hippocampus of SHR. A reduction of volume of frontal cortex gray and white matter as well as of striosomes and of gray matter of hippocampus was found in SHR. No changes in the total volume of neostriatum and in the volume of white matter of hippocampus were observed between SHR and normotensive WKY rats. These findings, which are consistent with recent evidence of the occurrence of atrophic changes in the brain of SHR, showed that <b>sulphatide</b> levels were decreased in the hippocampus of SHR. In this area no reduction of white matter was observed. <b>Sulphatide</b> concentrations are thought to reflect the status of brain myelinated fibers. The not parallel decrease of <b>sulphatide</b> levels and white matter volume in the majority of brain areas investigated suggests the occurrence in SHR of <b>sulphatide</b> changes not corresponding simply to a reduction of myelinated pathways...|$|E

Bis(sulphogangliotriosyl) ceramide and bis-sulphogangliotetraosylceramide did not bind the antibody.

40|$|A 6 -cm fresh {{proximal}} ileum surgical specimen from a {{blood group}} A(1) Le(a-b+) secretor individual {{was used for}} stepwise isolation of epithelial cells from villus tip to crypt bottom by gentle washing with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-containing buffer. Acid and non-acid sphingolipids were prepared from the epithelial cell fractions and the non-epithelial intestinal residue. Molecular information on the sphingolipid composition was obtained without further isolation of individual species by applying thin-layer chromatography using chemical and biological (monoclonal antibodies, cholera toxin, Escherichia coli) detection reagents, mass spectrometry and proton NMR spectroscopy of derivatized glycolipids. In this way, the structure of major and minor saccharides, ceramide components and their relative amounts were obtained. Epithelial cells and non-epithelial residue were distinctly different in their sphingolipid composition. Sphingomyelin was the major single component in both compartments. Characteristic for epithelial cells was the dominance of monoglycosylceramides, <b>sulphatides</b> and blood group fucolipids (mainly Le(b) hexaglycosylceramides and ALe(b) heptaglycosylceramides). The non-epithelial residue had about five times less glycolipids mainly mono-, di-, tri- and tetra-glycosylceramides and gangliosides, including the GM 1 ganglioside. The ceramides were more hydroxylated (1 - 2 additional hydroxyls) in epithelial cell glycolipids compared with the non-epithelial residue. Combined with a separate detailed study on the glycoproteins of the same epithelial cell preparation, this human intestinal sample is the only epithelial cell preparation where both protein- and lipid-linked saccharides are characterized in detail...|$|R
40|$|Laminins are a {{group of}} extracellular-matrix {{proteins}} important in development and disease. They are heterotrimers, and specific domains in the different chains have specialized functions. The G domain of the alpha 5 chain has now been produced in transfected mammalian cells as single modules and two tandem arrays, alpha 5 LG 1 - 3 and alpha 5 LG 4 - 5 (LG is laminin G domain-like). Using these fragments we produced specific polyclonal antibodies functional in immunoblotting and immunofluorescence studies and in solid-phase assays. Both alpha 5 LG tandem arrays had physiologically relevant affinities for sulphated ligands such as heparin and <b>sulphatides.</b> Cells adhered to these fragments and acquired a spread morphology when plated on alpha 5 LG 1 - 3. Binding of integrins alpha 3 beta 1 and alpha 6 beta 1 was localized to the alpha 5 LG 1 - 3 modules, and alpha-dystroglycan binding was localized to the alpha 5 LG 4 - 5 modules, thus locating these activities to different LG modules within the laminin alpha 5 G domain. However, both these activities were of relatively low affinity, indicating that integrin-mediated cell adhesion to the laminin 10 / 11 alpha 5 G domain depends on contributions from the other chains of the heterotrimer and that high-affinity alpha-dystroglycan binding could be dependent on specific Ca(2 +) -ion-co-ordinating amino acids absent from alpha 5 LG 4 - 5...|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that L-selectin binds to glycoconjugates {{containing}} the tetrasaccharide sialyl Lewis X in a Ca 2 +-dependent manner. In addition, {{a number of other}} acidic oligosaccharides (for example heparin or chondroitin sulphate) or glycolipids (for example <b>sulphatides)</b> bind to L-selectin independent of cations. In this paper we have established that L-selectin binds to charged phospholipids, such as cardiolipin and phosphatidylserine, but not to neutral phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine. No interaction between E-selectin and any phospholipid was observed. The interaction between L-selectin cardiolipin was inhibited by dextran sulphate, fucoidan, mannose 6 -phosphate and monoclonal antibodies previously reported to block the interaction between L-selectin and its natural ligands. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of the selectins indicated that L-selectin, but no E-selectin, contains a sequence homologous to the putative cardiolipin-binding epitope found in plasma glycoprotein beta 2 I. Glycoprotein beta 2 I and a peptide corresponding to the putative cardiolipin-binding epitope in beta 2 I inhibited the binding of L-selectin to cardiolipin or fucoidin. Based on the binding characteristics, sequence analysis and structural modelling of L-selectin, we suggest that the amino acid sequence KKNKED (residues 84 - 89) is a novel site for the binding of acidic species to L-selectin. This motif is localized close to the putative carbohydrate-binding domain of L-selectin and may be a second site within the lectin domain for the interaction of leucocyte L-selectin with its natural endothelial ligands...|$|R

40|$|Properdin is a serum {{glycoprotein}} that upregulates {{the alternative}} pathway of complement by stabilizing the C 3 bBb complex. It also binds sulphated glycoconjugates, such as <b>sulphatide,</b> in vitro. Properdin {{is composed of}} cyclic dimers, trimers and tetramers of a 53 kDa monomeric subunit. The monomer contains an N-terminal region of no known homology and six thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs) of approximately sixty amino acids. The sixth TSR of properdin contains an insertion of approximately 30 amino acids which corresponds {{to the position of}} an intron in the human properdin gene. In order to identify the regions of properdin important for function, human properdin, and mutant forms each lacking a single TSR, were expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. In addition, limited tryptic digestion yielded "nicked" properdin by the cleavage of one peptide bond in TSR 5. The structural and functional properties of the normal and altered forms of properdin were investigated. Wild type recombinant properdin is similar to properdin purified from plasma in size, immunoreactivity, N-terminal sequence, possession of N-linked sugar, oligomerization (as determined by electron microscopy and gel exclusion chromatography), and functional activity in an alternative pathway haemolytic assay, and in C 3 b and <b>sulphatide</b> binding assays. Properdin "nicked" in TSR 5 is unable to bind C 3 b, while retaining its overall structure and its ability to bind <b>sulphatide.</b> The removal of TSRS prevents C 3 b and <b>sulphatide</b> binding. Properdin lacking TSR 4 is unable to stabilize the C 3 bBb complex, but is able to bind C 3 b and <b>sulphatide,</b> and shows the presence of monomers and dimers in the electron microscope. Properdin without TSR 3 is able to stabilize the C 3 bBb complex, to bind CSb and <b>sulphatide,</b> and forms dimers, trimers and tetramers. Properdin lacking TSR 6 is unable to form oligomers. The N-linked carbohydrate of properdin is not required for oligomerization or stabilization of the C 3 bBb complex. Monoclonal antibodies which bind to the N-terminal region, TSR 1, or TSR 2 are able to inhibit properdin binding to CSb. A monoclonal antibody which binds TSR 4 is able to inhibit properdin binding to <b>sulphatide,</b> but not to CSb. The results confirm that TSRs are folded as independent units. The N-terminal end and TSR 5 of properdin are implicated in CSb binding. The vertices of properdin oligomers may be important for interaction with CSb. TSR 4 may also be involved in stabilization of the C 3 bBb complex. The <b>sulphatide</b> binding site is distinct from the CSb binding site, but TSR 5, which contains many basic residues, may be important for both activities. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{modes of}} uptake and {{degradation}} of radiolabelled cerebroside sulphate (CS or <b>sulphatide)</b> were investigated in cultured living skin fibroblasts and Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines established from control individuals and patients affected with metachromatic leucodystrophy (cerebroside sulphatase deficiency), multiple sulphatase deficiency and low-density-lipoprotein-receptor-negative familial hypercholesterolaemia. In both cell types, CS {{was taken up}} through a non-receptor-mediated process. In fibroblasts, CS degradation occurred intralysosomally as was evident from the findings that fibroblasts from metachromatic leucodystrophic patients accumulated the <b>sulphatide</b> and that chloroquine inhibited its degradation by normal cells. In contrast, under similar conditions of CS availability, lymphoblastoid cell lines from patients with metachromatic leucodystrophy could degrade the incorporated <b>sulphatide</b> exactly as their normal counterparts. This metabolic pathway was also fully active in lymphoblastoid cells from patients with multiple sulphatase deficiency and was not inhibited by chloroquine treatment. These data are consistent with a non-lysosomal type of hydrolysis. In addition to the lysosomal and non-lysosomal compartments, a third compartment was identified in the two cell types which is probably formed by the pool of the <b>sulphatide</b> molecules incorporated into the plasma membrane.

40|$|P 3 is a murine IgM mAb that {{recognize}} N-glycolilated gangliosides, <b>sulphatides</b> and antigens {{expressed in}} melanoma, breast and lung human tumors.

The mechanism by which the P 3 mAb, a self immunoglobuline, induce this immune response in the absence of co-stimulatory or classical danger signals is still unknown. In the present paper we show that the high immunogenicity of P 3 mAb depends not only on CD 4 but also on CD 8 + T cells, since the depletion of CD 8 + or CD 4 + T cells led to the loss of P 3 mAb immunogenicity in the syngeneic model. Furthermore, the immunization with P 3 mAb enhanced the recovery of the CD 8 + T cell population in mice treated with an anti-CD 8 a antibody. Additionally, the immunization with P 3 mAb restored the capacity of immunosuppressed mice to reject allogeneic tumors, a mechanism mediated by the action of CD 8 + T cells. Finally, in mice with cyclophosphamide induced lymphopenia, the administration of P 3 mAb accelerated the recovery of both CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells. These results show new possibilities for B and CD 8 + T cells interactions during the immune response elicited by a self-protein. Furthermore they point to P 3 mAb as a potential interesting candidate for the treatment of immunosuppressed patients...|$|R

Several shorter fragments {{have been prepared}} by recombinant production in mammalian cells and used to map the single glycosaminoglycan (GAG) substitution site and the binding of several carbohydrate and protein ligands. This identified a Ser 3511 residue located in a short link region between EG 4 and LG 3 as being involved in GAG attachment. :Electron microscopy provided evidence that the same substitution exists in tissue forms of perlecan. Heparan sulphate attached to this site was shown to bind to the alpha 1 LG 4 module of laminin-l, indicating a role in basement membrane assembly and cell-matrix interactions. This site is also close to an Asn-Asp bond which is readily cleaved by an endogenous protease {{that depends on the}} presence of Asp and the LG 2 module. A weak:heparin binding site was shown to include the EG 2 module, which contains five basic residues. Binding to <b>sulphatides</b> and the alpha-dystroglycan receptor was much stronger and required at least two LG modules. However, single LG modules appear to be sufficient for the interaction with the laminin-nidogen complex, while EG 3 - 4 and some flanking regions are apparently involved in fibulin- 2 binding. These observations indicate that a complex modular structure is required for domain V in order to provide a rich repertoire of potential biological functions.

40|$|The N-terminal {{sequences}} of mouse laminin alpha 3 B and alpha 5 chains {{have been completed}} and demonstrate {{the presence of a}} signal peptide followed by a complete laminin N-terminal (LN) module (domain VI). These signal peptides were released after recombinant production of larger fragments comprising domains VI/V (45 - 65 kDa) from this region yielding properly folded proteins, which were secreted from HEK- 293 -EBNA cells. Pepsin digestion of these fragments yielded products of 25 - 35 kDa, which consisted only of domain V. The alphaVI/V fragments were able to inhibit self-assembly of laminin- 1, with those from the alpha 3 B and alpha 5 chains being more active than those from alpha 1 and alpha 2 chains. Domain V fragments, however, showed a reduced activity, indicating the major contribution of the LN module in inhibition. These interactions were confirmed by surface-plasmon-resonance assays demonstrating moderate affinities (K(d) = 0. 02 to > 6 microM) for the binding to laminin- 1. This indicated that laminins containing alpha 3 B or alpha 5 chains should also be able to form non-covalent networks by polymerization. The LN modules also showed heparin binding in affinity chromatography, which was strongest for alpha 1 /alpha 2, moderate for alpha 3 B, whereas no binding was observed for alpha 5. They all bound to heparan sulphate chains of perlecan and to <b>sulphatides,</b> with a lower variability in binding activity. Specific antibodies were raised against alpha 3 BVI/V and alpha 5 VI/V and were shown to stain basement membrane zones in various mouse tissues.

In the sera of lepromatous leprosy (LL) patients who experienced an erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) episode the SAP fell {{at the onset}} of ENL and remained low throughout, in two of three cases. Changes in SAP concentration parallel anti-sulphatide IgM concentrations. TH 3, a monoclonal IgM germ-line antibody derived from a LL patient, and SAP share similar binding patterns.

The observation that anti-TH 3 idiotype monoclonal and polyclonal anti-SAP antibodies both inhibited the binding of TH 3 and IgM in sera (but not IgG) to <b>sulphatide</b> without binding to <b>sulphatide</b> themselves further demonstrated similar binding specificities.

Antigen-antibody binding was strongly blocked by 1 mM heparin, dextran sulphate and chondroitin sulphate A, and by 5 mM chondroitin sulphate B. Antibodies avidly absorb to rabbit erythrocytes, but discretely to rat erythrocytes, suggesting that they are different from galactocerebroside antibodies. Elevated levels of <b>sulphatide</b> antibodies were present in all of 102 chronic Trypanosoma cruzi-infected patients studied, but not in other patients having cutaneous or visceral leishmaniasis, T. rangeli infection or several other protozoal, helminthic or mycotic infections. Interestingly, 100 % of 40 dilated cardiomyopathy patients also have elevated levels of <b>sulphatide</b> antibodies. As T. cruzi is rich in galactocerebroside sulphate, it is proposed that in chagasic patients this glycolipid could act as an immunogen, inducing elevated titres of <b>sulphatide</b> antibodies, which could be important in the pathogenesis of cardiac or peripheral nerve symptoms...|$|E
40|$|We tested sera of {{patients}} with various autoimmune rheumatic diseases {{for the presence of}} antibodies against <b>sulphatide</b> (an acidic glycosphingolipid), identified as a target antigen for antibodies against the liver cell membrane. Thirty-five percent (7 / 20) {{of patients}} with lupus in the active stage possessed anti-sulphatide antibodies, whereas 10 % (2 / 20) of those in the inactive stage and 20 % (4 / 20) of those in the stationary stage possessed such antibodies. Moreover, 10 % (3 / 29) {{of patients with}} other autoimmune rheumatic diseases also possessed anti-sulphatide antibodies. The level of anti-sulphatide antibodies was significantly correlated with the levels of anti-double-stranded (ds) DNA antibodies (r = 0. 634, P less than 0. 001) and dextran sulphate-binding IgG (r = 0. 407, P less than 0. 001). The serum levels of antibodies against <b>sulphatide</b> were correlated with a history of seizures or psychosis in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases. Gels coupled with polyanionic dextran sulphate, monoanionic sulphanilic acid and DNA were shown effectively to adsorb anti-sulphatide antibodies in the sera of patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and autoimmune chronic active hepatitis (AI-CAH). These results suggest that the observed reactivity with <b>sulphatide</b> is due to the presence of antibodies capable of reacting with various anionic molecules in the sera of patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases as well as those with AI-CAH...|$|E
40|$|Gangliosides are sialic acid-containing glycolipids {{which are}} formed by a {{hydrophobic}} portion, the ceramide, and a hydrophilic part, i. e. the oligosaccharide chain. First described in neural tissue, {{several studies have}} shown that gangliosides are almost ubiquitous molecules expressed in all vertebrate tissues. Within cells, gangliosides are usually associated with plasma membranes, where they can act as receptors for a variety of molecules and have been shown to take part in cell-to-cell interaction and in signal transduction. In addition, gangliosides are expressed in cytosol membranes like those of secretory granules of some endocrine cells (adrenal medulla, pancreatic islets). As far as the role of gangliosides in diseases is concerned, there are some cases in which an aberrant ganglioside expression plays {{a crucial role in the}} disease pathogenetic process. These diseases include two major forms of ganglioside storage, namely GM 2 -gangliosidosis (Tay-Sachs and its beta-hexosaminidase deficiency) and GM 1 -gangliosidosis (beta-galactosidase deficiency), where the most prominent pathological characteristic is the lysosomal ganglioside accumulation in neurons. Other inflammatory or degenerative diseases both within and outside the nervous system have been shown to be associated with an altered pattern of ganglioside expression in the target organ. Since monoclonal antibodies have been discovered and used in immunology, a large variety of ganglioside antigens has been described both as blood group antigens and as tumour-related antigens. Several studies have also indicated that gangliosides can act not only as antigens, but also as autoantigens. As a matter of fact, auto-antibodies to gangliosides, detected by immunostaining methods performed directly on TLC plates or by ELISA, have been described in several autoimmune disorders such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, multiple sclerosis, lupus erythematosus, Hashimoto's thyroiditis and, last but not least, insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetes mellitus. This last disease is caused by the autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic islet cells in genetically predisposed individuals. Autoantibodies and T lymphocytes directed towards multiple islet autoantigens have been detected in the circulation, well before the clinical onset of the disease, in a prodromal phase during which pancreatic islet beta-cells are presumably destroyed. Among the target autoantigens, some are of protein nature but others are acidic glycolipids such as <b>sulphatides</b> 158 and the gangliosides GT 3, GD 3 and especially GM 2 - 1. This last component is specifically expressed in pancreatic islets and has been shown to represent a target of IgG autoantibodies highly associated with diabetes development in first-degree relatives of type 1 diabetic individuals. In addition, the GM 2 - 1 ganglioside appears to be one of the antigens recognized by cytoplasmic ICA, a heterogeneous group of antibodies which specifically react with islets on pancreatic frozen sections. In conclusion, studies performed in the last decade have clearly indicated that gangliosides represent a heterogeneous class of molecules that are involved in several cellular processes that are of crucial importance in physiological as well as in pathological conditions. Interestingly, these molecules, despite their small size, have been shown to represent not only important antigens in tumour immunology but are also able to elicit a specific autoimmune response, thus representing important autoantigens in some autoimmune disorders. It is of interest that, in addition to neurological autoimmune disorders where autoimmunity to gangliosides is frequent and usually of considerable magnitude, an autoimmune response to this class of molecules has been observed in autoimmune diabetes...|$|R

40|$|Cultured human {{fibroblasts}} {{were fed}} with two differently labelled <b>sulphatide</b> molecules [one labelled on C- 3 of the sphingosine (Sph) moiety [(Sph- 3 H]sulphatide), the second on C- 1 of stearic acid [(stearoyl- 14 C]sulphatide) ], and the intracellular metabolic fate of radioactivity was monitored. Incorporated radioactivity was almost all recovered {{in the total}} lipid extract, regardless of the labelling position of the added sulphatide; however, large differences {{in the level of}} incorporation occurred among labelled glycosphingolipids. For example, sphingomyelin was present as the major radiolabelled lipid after [Sph- 3 H]-sulphatide incubation, but was detectable only in trace amounts after [stearoyl- 14 C]sulphatide administration; in the latter case the radioactivity was located predominantly in glycerophospholipids. From this finding it can be inferred that the free long-chain base (sphingosine) that originates from lysosomal catabolism of <b>sulphatide</b> is mainly, and quite specifically, utilized for sphingomyelin biosynthesis, whereas the ceramide moiety is not; conversely the fatty acid released from ceramide is non-specifically re-utilized for phospholipid biosynthesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} neutral (galactocerebroside and asialo-ganglioside GM 1) or anionic (<b>sulphatide</b> and gangliosides GM 1, GD 1 a and GT 1 b) glycosphingolipids on the {{activity}} of phospholipase A 2 from pig pancreas was studied in mixed monolayers of dilauroyl phosphatidylcholine with the glycosphingolipids in different molar fractions at various constant surface pressures. The activity of the enzyme depends on the proportion and type of glycosphingolipid in the interface. <b>Sulphatide</b> activates the enzyme at all proportions, whereas galactocerebroside shows inhibition or activation depending on its proportion in the film. Asialo-ganglioside GM 1 and gangliosides GM 1, GD 1 a and GT 1 b can strongly inhibit the enzyme at relatively low molar fractions in the film in the following order: asialo-ganglioside GM 1 less than ganglioside GM 1 less than ganglioside GT 1 b less than ganglioside GD 1 a. The changes of activity are not due to a direct action of the lipids on the active centre or interfacial recognition region of the enzyme...|$|E

Methods: <b>Sulphatide</b> concentrations and enzyme activity were determined by means of spectrophotometric devices; thin-layer chromatography was also prepared to separate and visualize sulphatides and other lipid fractions. Results: The spectrophotometric values of sulphatides and arylsulphatase A were high in the decidua samples obtained from women at term pregnancy. Conclusions: The spectrophotometric values of the two parameters examined in the decidua of women at term pregnancy were high because of a persistent progestinic activity. © Copyright 2004, CIC Edizioni Internazionali, Rome...|$|E
40|$|Sera from 40 leprosy {{patients}} were screened for autoantibodies to cerebroside sulphate (<b>sulphatide).</b> Anti-sulphatide IgM {{in groups of}} patients with lepromatous (LL) and borderline (BL + BB + BT), but not with tuberculoid (TT) disease, were significantly elevated above the levels found in endemic control subjects. Eight-six percent (18 out of 21; mean 1. 59 OD units) of LL, 33 % (four out of 12; mean 1. 08 OD units) of borderline and 13 % (one out of eight; mean 0. 69 OD units) of tuberculoid patients had anti-sulphatide IgM in their sera above a cut-off value of 2 s. d. above the mean value (0. 66 OD units) for control sera. Elevated anti-sulphatide IgG was detected in only one patient's serum, an individual with LL disease. The level of anti-sulphatide IgM was strongly correlated to expression of the TH 3 idiotype, an idiotype previously defined by a human MoAb that bound Mycobacterium leprae phenolic glycolipid, Klebsiella capsular polysaccharide, polynucleotides and human tissues. The purified, TH 3 MoAb was {{found in this study}} to bind <b>sulphatide,</b> but not cholesterol- 3 -sulphate or cerebroside. It is suggested that anti-sulphatide IgM is elevated in leprosy, in relation to the bacterial load. Anti-sulphatide IgM fell at the onset of erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) reaction, consistent with the deposition of serum antibodies, and thus may play a part in pathology during periods of inflammation, particularly in multibacillary patients...|$|E

The motor nerve conduction velocity of the peripheral nerves in upper and lower extremities was distinctly decreased. Cerebral disturbances were not evident. It is surmised that this patient {{is a case of}} late adult metachromatic leukodystrophy in an early stage of the disease without obvious clinical signs.

Among the diseases which affect the white matter of the nervous system a sub-group is recognized as the heredo-degenerative type or the leucodystrophies. In 1956 Poser and van Bogaert (1956) stated that it was almost imposslble to make a clinical diagnosis of the leucodystrophies unless there was a well-documented family history. However, by the demonstration of a characteristic <b>sulphatide</b> pattern of urinary sediment lipids by paper chromatography the metachromatic type of leucodystrophy (sulphatidosis) can now be diagnosed during life (Hagberg and Svennerholm, 1960...|$|E
40|$|Stability of the myelin-axon unit is achieved, {{at least}} in part, by {{specialized}} paranodal junctions comprised of the neuronal heterocomplex of contactin and contactin-associated protein and the myelin protein neurofascin 155. In multiple sclerosis, normal distribution of these proteins is altered, resulting {{in the loss of}} the insulating myelin and consequently causing axonal dysfunction. Previously, this laboratory reported that mice lacking the myelin-enriched lipid <b>sulphatide</b> are characterized by a progressive deterioration of the paranodal structure. Here, it is shown that this deterioration is preceded by significant loss of neurofascin 155 clustering at the myelin paranode. Interestingly, prolonged electrophoretic separation revealed the existence of two neurofascin 155 bands, neurofascin 155 high and neurofascin 155 low, which are readily observed following N-linked deglycosylation. Neurofascin 155 high is observed at 7 days of age and reaches peak expression at one month of age, while neurofascin 155 low is first observed at 14 days of age and constantly increases until 5 months of age. Studies using conditional neurofascin knockout mice indicated that neurofascin 155 high and neurofascin 155 low are products of the neurofascin gene and are exclusively expressed by oligodendrocytes within the central nervous system. Neurofascin 155 high is a myelin paranodal protein while the distribution of neurofascin 155 low remains to be determined. While neurofascin 155 high levels are significantly reduced in the <b>sulphatide</b> null mice at 15 days, 30 days and 4 months of age, neurofascin 155 low levels remain unaltered. Although maintained at normal levels, neurofascin 155 low is incapable of preserving paranodal structure, thus indicating that neurofascin 155 high is required for paranodal stability. Additionally, comparisons between neurofascin 155 high and neurofascin 155 low in human samples revealed a significant alteration, specifically in multiple sclerosis plaques...|$|E
