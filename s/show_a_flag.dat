Ten minutes showed they were gaining; twenty did better and in an hour she was well on the quarter.|$|E

50|$|The white cross {{was thus}} in origin a field mark {{attached}} to combatants for identification, and later also to cantonal flags.The Lucerne chronicle of 1513, in battle {{scenes of the}} Burgundy wars of the 1470s shows cantonal flags with an added white cross.In this context, the solid-red war flag of Schwyz {{with the addition of}} the white cross appears much like the later flag of Switzerland.Other depictions in the illustrated chronicles <b>show</b> <b>a</b> <b>flag</b> of Schwyz with an asymmetrical white cross, drawn in greater detail.The symbol of the confederation as it developed during 1450-1520 was thus the white cross itself, not necessarily in a red field, but attached to existing flags, so that it appeared before a red background in those cantonal flags that contained red, notably the solid-red flag of Schwyz.|$|E

The boxes often did not show {{the number of the}} car, but it could be seen on the base.
