50|$|The {{addition}} of a ball-and-spring-type detent on the <b>shift</b> <b>sleeve</b> and detents on the shift rail assists the driver in shifting quicker. The detent raises the force required to move the shift lever which prevents excess movement of the shifter by the driver, and reduces the chance of double bump. Tension between the <b>shift</b> <b>sleeve</b> and the shift rail also prevents the sleeve from vibrating while in gear.|$|E
25|$|Sleeves were bell- or trumpet-shaped, {{and caught}} {{up at the}} elbow to show the frilled or lace-trimmed <b>sleeves</b> of the <b>shift</b> (chemise) beneath. <b>Sleeves</b> became {{narrower}} as the period progressed, with a frill at the elbow, and elaborate separate ruffles called engageantes were tacked to the <b>shift</b> <b>sleeves,</b> in a fashion that would persist into the 1770s.|$|R

50|$|In mid-1947, the {{embroidered}} device <b>shifted</b> {{from the}} <b>sleeve</b> of the enlisted men's jumper to above the left breast pocket. A {{change to the}} Uniform Regulations dated 21 September 1950 authorized the embroidered insignia for officers (in addition to the pin-on insignia) and a bronze, silver-plated, pin-on insignia for enlisted men (in addition to the embroidered device).|$|R

Sleeve in equilibrium position, with control land covering control port. For lowest pressure setting, <b>sleeve</b> <b>shifted</b> toward right by increased pressure on sleeve shoulder from servovalve. Pump used in aircraft and robots, where hydraulic actuators repeatedly turned on and off, changing pump load frequently and over wide range...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present an {{innovative}} electromechanical device which integrates a brushless DC (BLDC) hub motor with a speed-changing wheel hub stored on the rear wheel of an electric bicycle. It combines a power source and a speed-changing mechanism to simultaneously provide functions of power generation and transmission for electric bicycles. As part of the proposed integrated device, the wheel hub consists of a basic planetary gear train providing three forward speeds including a low-speed gear, a direct drive, and a high-speed gear. Each gear is manually controlled by the <b>shift</b> control <b>sleeve</b> to selectively engage or disengage four pawl-and-ratchet clutches based on its clutching sequence table. The number of gear teeth of each gear element of the wheel hub is synthesized. The BLDC hub motor is an exterior-rotor-type permanent-magnet synchronous motor. Two-dimensional finite-element analysis (FEA) software is employed to facilitate the motor design and performance analysis. An analysis of the power transmission path at each gear is provided to verify the validity of the proposed design. The results of this work are beneficial to the embodiment, design, and development of novel electromechanical devices for the power and transmission systems of electric bicycles...|$|R
2500|$|The rank of Corporal was {{abolished}} in 1972, but reinstated in 1976. In 1997, all ranks were <b>shifted</b> {{from the}} <b>sleeves</b> to the epaulettes, {{except for the}} Gurkha Contingent. Also in the same year, the Station Inspector rank was changed from collar pips to epaulettes with a new design {{similar to that of}} the SAF Warrant Officers, and the rank of Senior Station Inspector was introduced. In 1998, the Senior Station Inspector (2) rank was introduced, and changes were made to the SI, SSI, and SSI(2) rank designs. The rank of Lance Corporal was abolished in 2002. The 2006, the Gurkha Contingent adopted embroidered ranks as part of an overhaul of its combat dress, but are worn on the right front pocket. There was a major rank overhaul in 2016 with the removal of the ranks of CPL, SSGT, SSI and SSI(2), as well as the removal of the distinction between [...] "Police Officers" [...] and [...] "Senior Police Officers" [...] in what is now called a [...] "unified police scheme".|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} how humans {{trained in}} primitive hap- tic based patterns using a wearable sleeve, can recognize their scaling and <b>shifting.</b> The wearable <b>sleeve</b> consisted of 7 vibro-actuators to stimulate subjects arm {{to convey the}} primitive haptic based patterns. The used primitive haptic patterns are the Gaussian template (T), shifted right (R), shifted left (L), half Gaussian (H), and shrink (S) hereafter denoted by templates. The results of this paper would give an idea as to how humans mentally construct the cutaneous feedback in different scenarios such as shifting and scaling with respect to trained patterns and how they recognize all trained patterns when played randomly. These insights will help to develop more eï¿½efficient haptic feedback systems us- ing {{a small number of}} templates to be learnt to encode complex haptic messages. Therefore, the results provide new insights and design guide- lines/algorithm to convey messages encoded in vibro-tactile actuator arrays specially in where vision and audition are less reliable scenarios like search and rescue, factories. For example, the results would be used to convey a message to the human to give an idea of the shape and stiffness of obstacles that come into contact with the robot during haptic based guiding in low visibility conditions in human-robot interactions...|$|R
