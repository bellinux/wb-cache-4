25|$|In {{the face}} of the failure of Project Tiger, the Pentagon wanted CIA {{paramilitary}} forces to participate in their Op Plan 64A, this resulted in the CIA's foreign paramilitaries being put under the command of the DOD, a move seen as a <b>slippery</b> <b>slope</b> inside the CIA, a slide from covert action towards militarization.|$|E
25|$|One major {{difference}} between these two approaches is the agent's responsibility. Positive consequentialism demands that we bring about good states of affairs, whereas negative consequentialism requires that we avoid bad ones. Stronger versions of negative consequentialism will require active intervention to prevent bad and ameliorate existing harm. In weaker versions, simple forbearance from acts tending to harm others is sufficient. An example of this is the <b>Slippery</b> <b>Slope</b> Argument, which encourages others to avoid a specified act {{on the grounds that it}} may ultimately lead to undesirable consequences.|$|E
50|$|Those {{who hold}} that <b>slippery</b> <b>slopes</b> are causal {{generally}} give a simple definition, provide some appropriate examples and perhaps add some discussion {{as to the}} difficulty of determining whether the argument is reasonable or fallacious. Most of the more detailed analysis of <b>slippery</b> <b>slopes</b> has been done by those who hold that genuine <b>slippery</b> <b>slopes</b> are of the decisional kind.|$|R

25|$|Similarly, Emanuel {{argues that}} there are four major {{arguments}} presented by opponents of euthanasia: a) not all deaths are painful; b) alternatives, such as cessation of active treatment, combined {{with the use of}} effective pain relief, are available; c) the distinction between active and passive euthanasia is morally significant; and d) legalising euthanasia will place society on a <b>slippery</b> <b>slope,</b> which will lead to unacceptable consequences. In fact, in Oregon, in 2013, pain wasn't one of the top five reasons people sought euthanasia. Top reasons were a loss of dignity, and a fear of burdening others.|$|E
25|$|The {{end of the}} seventeenth-century and the {{beginning}} of the eighteenth-century witnessed an increasing concern for vices and immorality spreading all over the country. There was a general sense of falling into the worst possible form of behaviour and a common feeling that avarice, vice, idleness, blasphemy, vagrancy and crime were all entangles together pushing people (poor and wealthy, young and old) into a <b>slippery</b> <b>slope</b> to damnation. A drastic social reformation was required and, at the end of the seventeenth-century, societies for the reformation of manners started emerging with a rank of proper paid agents operating locally. Indeed, Defoe was just one of the many eighteenth-century voices believing that at least part of the falling of the offender was due to a weakening of the social and moral values of the English society.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{argue that}} {{increasing}} the number of teams would increase the validity of team comparisons in conferences, which do not compete with one another during the regular season; teams typically only play three or four non-conference games, as the result of pre-determined schedules. BCS proponents view the possibility of expanded competitive post-season opportunities as negative. The primary delivery of this objection is a <b>slippery</b> <b>slope</b> argument rhetorically known as bracket creep. Implementation of a playoff system, proponents object, would lead to other, more serious consequences, such as the diminished value of the regular season, diminished value of the bowl tradition, or damage to the collegiate academic calendar year. Critics, including Republican congressman Joe Barton, have been quick to respond to these red herrings, noting that teams from non-AQ conferences are already excluded from the national championship and their inclusion would only improve the meaningfulness of the regular season.|$|E
50|$|Decisional <b>slippery</b> <b>slopes</b> {{are similar}} to {{conceptual}} <b>slippery</b> <b>slopes</b> in that they rely on there being a continuum with no clear dividing lines such that {{if you decide to}} accept one position or course of action then there will, either now or in the future, be no rational grounds for not accepting the next position or course of action in the sequence.|$|R

Oppositely, the expression [...] "boiling frog syndrome" [...] is sometimes used as shorthand to invoke the pitfalls of standing pat.|$|E

500|$|In October 2006, a {{resident}} of Marshall, Missouri attempted to have Fun Home and Craig Thompson's Blankets, both graphic novels, removed from the city's public library. Supporters of the books' removal characterized them as [...] "pornography" [...] and expressed concern {{that they would be}} read by children. Marshall Public Library Director Amy Crump defended the books as having been well-reviewed in [...] "reputable, professional book review journals," [...] and characterized the removal attempt as a step towards [...] "the <b>slippery</b> <b>slope</b> of censorship". On October 11, 2006, the library's board appointed a committee to create a materials selection policy, and removed Fun Home and Blankets from circulation until the new policy was approved. The committee [...] "decided not to assign a prejudicial label or segregate [...] by a prejudicial system", and presented a materials selection policy to the board. On March 14, 2007, the Marshall Public Library Board of Trustees voted to return both Fun Home and Blankets to the library's shelves. Bechdel described the attempted banning as [...] "a great honor", and described the incident as [...] "part of the whole evolution of the graphic-novel form." ...|$|E
40|$|A growing {{literature}} {{in law and}} public policy harnesses research in behavioral economics to justify {{a new form of}} paternalism. Contributors to this literature typically emphasize the modest, non-intrusive character of their proposals. A distinct {{literature in}} law and public policy analyzes the validity of “slippery slope” arguments. Contributors to this literature have identified various mechanisms and processes by which <b>slippery</b> <b>slopes</b> operate, as well as the circumstances in which the threat of such slopes is greatest. The present article sits at the nexus of the new paternalist literature and the <b>slippery</b> <b>slopes</b> literature. We argue that the new paternalism exhibits many characteristics identified by the slopes literature as conducive to <b>slippery</b> <b>slopes.</b> Specifically, the new paternalism exhibits considerable theoretical and empirical vagueness, making it vulnerable to slopes resulting from altered economic incentives, enforcement needs, deference to perceived authority, bias toward simple principles, and reframing of the status quo. These slope processes are especially likely when decisionmakers are subject to cognitive biases – as the new paternalists insist they are. Consequently, soft paternalism can pave the way for harder paternalism. We conclude that policymaking based on new paternalist reasoning should be considered with greater trepidation than its advocates have suggested...|$|R

500|$|Crime stories {{grabbed the}} {{headlines}} in the 1920s and 1930s. After Prohibition took effect in 1920 until its demise in 1933, it opened up a financial bonanza for criminal activity, especially underground bootlegging and the smuggling of liquor into Chicago, Gary, South Bend, Fort Wayne, Indianapolis, Evansville and other thirsty cities. Enforcement was haphazard; the Anti-Saloon League {{was more of a}} lobbying agency and never rallied community support for enforcement. The KKK called for punishment of bootleggers and set up the [...] "Horse Thief Detective Association" [...] (HTDA) to make extra-legal raids on speakeasies and gambling joints. It seldom cooperated with law enforcement or the state or federal courts. Instead gave enforcement a bad name. Arthur Gillom, a Republican elected state attorney general over Klan opposition in 1924, did not tolerate its extra-legal operations. Instead, [...] "He stressed the dangers of citizens relinquishing their constitutional rights and personal freedoms, and emphasized the importance of representative government (at all levels), states' rights, and the concept of separation of church and state." [...] When Rev. Shumaker proposed that [...] "personal liberty had to be sacrificed in order to save people," [...] Gilliom replied that surrendering power and individual freedoms was a <b>slippery</b> <b>slope</b> to centralized government and tyranny.|$|E
500|$|The {{first section}} {{of the book is}} a {{discussion}} of targeted killing of non-combatants. In an essay titled [...] "Rebutting the Civilian Presumption: Playing Whack-a-Mole Without a Mallet?", Colonel Mark Maxwell criticizes the opposition of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to targeted killing. Maxwell writes that individuals may indeed serve a combat task without being a member of a particular state force. He argues for an extension of the definition of combatant to include those who arm themselves and engage in combat roles. [...] "Targeting Co-Belligerents" [...] by professor Jens David Ohlin supports Maxwell's opinion and describes an analytical viewpoint called [...] "linkage" [...] in which he states armed terrorists and members of organizations can be killed. Ohlin interprets the guidelines of the ICRC to include reliance upon a military system of identification of combatants. [...] "Can Just War Theory Justify Targeted Killing" [...] by professor Daniel Statman is an analysis of three thought processes used to discuss targeted killing rules: [...] "contractualist", [...] "collectivist", and [...] "individualist". Statman writes that the tactic of targeted killing is a just form of combat in each of these analyses. New York University and Oxford University professor Jeremy Waldron deconstructs the morality associated with the tactic and argues against its use. He says that similar rationalizations could be used by the enemy against those conducting the targeted killings, there may be an inherent selection bias of targets, and warns of a <b>slippery</b> <b>slope</b> when defending an actor that uses the methodology.|$|E
500|$|At the September 2016 Family Research Council Action Values Voter Summit (VVS) in Washington, DC, where Republican {{presidential and}} vice presidential {{candidates}} Donald Trump and Mike Pence also spoke, Bevin [...] "both lamented {{and called for}} revolution and bloodshed to 'redeem' what [...] be lost" [...] if Hillary Clinton were to be victorious in the 2016 presidential election, according to one review of Bevin's speech. He used and echoed the language about [...] "the tree of liberty" [...] being refreshed by the blood of patriots and addressed his own family in the same regard– [...] "I have nine children ... it might be their blood [...] is needed." [...] A second review of the speech said Bevin [...] "urged young Americans especially to 'be bold' and to avoid the temptation to be silent {{in the face of}} left-wing ideologues attempting to remake America." [...] This review continued through [...] "Neville Chamberlains in the world" [...] contrasting with [...] "a Winston Churchill" [...] and [...] "It's a <b>slippery</b> <b>slope....</b> First, we're killing [...] children , then it's 'Don't ask, don't tell,' now it's this gender-bending kind of 'don't be a bigot,' 'don't be unreasonable,' 'don't be unenlightened.'" [...] Before the final call to service and sacrifice in the speech, in this account, an audience member and then Bevin addressed [...] "hose blood will be shed" [...] in, as another account put it, [...] "violent metaphor." [...] Afterwards, Bevin was asked about the [...] "blood ... shed" [...] part of the speech and, according to a summary, [...] "appeared to say {{he was referring to the}} cost paid by men and women in uniform." [...] A third account of the VVS appearance said he had spoken without notes or teleprompter. Another account reported that he [...] "referenced the rise of the Nazis preceding the Holocaust twice, invoking German pastor Martin Niemöller's oft-cited quote that ends, 'then they came for me– and there was no one left to speak for me.'" ...|$|E
