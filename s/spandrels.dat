5|$|Prior to restoration, {{of all the}} {{paintings}} in the Sistine Chapel, the lunettes and <b>spandrels</b> were the dirtiest. Added to this, {{there has always been}} a problem of poor daytime visibility of the panels nearest the windows because of halination. Consequently, they were the least well known of all Michelangelo's publicly accessible works. The recent restoration has made these masterly studies of human nature and inventive depiction of the human form known once more.|$|E
5|$|The Ignudi, {{although}} all seated, are less physically constrained than the Ancestors of Christ. While the pairs of the monochrome {{male and female}} figures above the <b>spandrels</b> are mirrors of each other, these Ignudi are all different. In the earliest paintings, they are paired, their poses being similar but with variation. These variations become greater with each pair until the postures of the final four bear no relation to each other whatsoever.|$|E
5|$|The first {{element in}} the scheme of painted {{architecture}} is a definition of the real architectural elements by accentuating the lines where <b>spandrels</b> and pendentives intersect with the curving vault. Michelangelo painted these as decorative courses that look like sculpted stone moldings. These have two repeating motifs, a formula common in Classical architecture. Here, one motif is the acorn, the symbol of the family of both Pope Sixtus IV, who built the chapel, and Pope Julius II, who commissioned Michelangelo's work. The other motif is the scallop shell, one of the symbols of the Madonna, to whose assumption the chapel was dedicated in 1483. The crown of the wall then rises above the <b>spandrels,</b> to a strongly projecting painted cornice that runs right around the ceiling, separating the pictorial areas of the biblical scenes from the figures of Prophets, Sibyls, and Ancestors, who literally and figuratively support the narratives. Ten broad painted crossribs of travertine cross the ceiling and divide it into alternately wide and narrow pictorial spaces, a grid that gives all the figures their defined place.|$|E
50|$|The {{bridge was}} planned as a flat arch bridge, but {{aerodynamic}} considerations {{led to an}} open <b>spandrel</b> design. The main span supports eight <b>spandrel</b> columns and there are four other columns over the motorway cutting. The <b>spandrel</b> columns are 18 in thick.|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{concerns the}} problem of load transfer from the slab through the <b>spandrel</b> beams (edge beams) to the exterior columns in flat plate construction. The load is transferred from the slab to the <b>spandrel</b> beam {{through a combination of}} shear and bending forces. The <b>spandrel</b> beam in turn transfers the load to the exterior column primarily by torsion. Hence the strength of the slab is controlled by the strength of its supporting members. The behavior and strength of the <b>spandrel</b> beams of nine 0. 3 scale reinforced concrete flat plate specimens are described in this report. The influence of shear and bending moments on the torsional capacity of the beams is discussed and equations for predicting strength examined. The primary variables in the tests were the beam dimensions and reinforcements The results showed that the initial torsional stiffness of the <b>spandrel</b> beams was dependent on {{the size and shape of}} the <b>spandrel</b> beams while the post-cracking stiffness was a function of the beam torsional reinforcement. For design purposes, <b>spandrel</b> beams can be treated as isolated beams provided that the bending and shear forces on the beam are not significants Comparisons were made between the computed and measured torsional capacities of the <b>spandrel</b> beams and these comparisons showed that the extension developed by Hsu (3) are satisfactory for, predicting the torsional strength of <b>spandrel</b> beams...|$|R
40|$|Full-scale {{exterior}} beam-column-slab sub-assemblages {{were tested}} under reversed cyclic loading {{to investigate the}} role or the <b>spandrel</b> beam in the overall response. Results from specimens having different <b>spandrel</b> beam sizes and different amounts of torsional reinforcement in the <b>spandrel</b> beams provided {{a better understanding of}} their behaviour. The test specimens were heavily instrumented to enable detailed strain measurements in the slab bars, the joint region and the <b>spandrel</b> beam. These strains together with the crack pattern provide some insight into the flow of forces from the slab and <b>spandrel</b> beam into the joint region. The tests show that the effective width of the slab contributing to the negative bending of the main beam is affected by the torsional yielding of the <b>spandrel</b> beam. However, after this yielding, a different force mechanism, involving concrete compressive struts, and tension ties in the slab and <b>spandrel</b> beam bars, provides means of transferring additional forces from the slab bars to the joint region. It is important to consider the effect of these forces since they increase the negative moment capacity of the beams, and hence, they may affect the hierarchy of yielding between the columns and the beams. This effect may in turn alter the failure mode of the structure. Tentative design proposals, accounting for the flow of forces through the <b>spandrel</b> beam, are presented. The application of these proposals are illustrated for a number of different specimens having varying <b>spandrel</b> beam dimensions...|$|R
5|$|There {{is also an}} {{indeterminate}} {{relationship between}} the figures in the <b>spandrels</b> and the lunettes beneath them. Because of {{the constraints of the}} triangular shape, in each spandrel the figures are seated on the ground. In six of the eight <b>spandrels</b> the compositions resemble traditional depictions of the Flight into Egypt. Of the two remaining, one shows a woman with shears trimming the neck of a garment she is making while her toddler looks on. The Biblical woman who is recorded as making a new garment for her child is Hannah, the mother of Samuel, whose child went to live in the temple, and indeed, the male figure in the background is wearing a distinctive hat that might suggest that of a priest. The other figure who differs from the rest is a young woman who sits staring out of the picture with prophetic intensity. Her open eyes have been closed in the restoration.|$|E
5|$|A {{comparison}} of two <b>spandrels</b> reveals different post-restoration states. The {{one on the}} left has shadows and details defined in black. The green robe with yellow highlights has been washed with black and defined with deep shadow. On the fictive architecture each motif is picked out in black. The eyes of the child are detailed in black and white. The continued presence of these details suggests that they were completed while the plaster was damp. The entire right spandrel has an unfinished look. Before cleaning it also had black defining the shadows of the robes and crisp detailing on the architecture.|$|E
5|$|A {{very similar}} archway {{is found in}} Dieric Bouts's c. 1445 Mary Altarpiece, {{including}} <b>spandrels</b> with warriors. Art historians are unsure which was painted earlier– Christus's Nativity or Bouts's altarpiece. Equally, van der Weyden's arched triptychs were executed {{at roughly the same}} period, but art historians are more certain Rogier's archivolt design set the precedent. Unlike Bouts and van der Weyden, Christus appears to have used the device to encompass a single scene, incorporating all the main characters within the arch, instead of a linked series of scenes with separate archways.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>spandrel</b> walls on the {{stiffness}} and ultimate strength of reinforced concrete columns was studied. Twenty-six columns {{are subjected to}} cyclic loading with deflection-control. The effect of connecting position of the walls can be neglected to estimate the yield stiffness and ultimate strength of reinforced concrete columns. The strength, however, {{is influenced by the}} thickness and height of <b>spandrel</b> walls. The effective height of column with <b>spandrel</b> walls by the AIJ Code is found to be conservative. The more effective equations to estimate the stiffness and ultimate strength for the columns with <b>spandrel</b> walls are proposed herein...|$|R

5|$|Between {{the large}} pendentives {{that support the}} vault are windows, six {{on each side of}} the chapel. There were two more windows in each end of the chapel, now closed, and those above the High Altar covered by the Last Judgement. Above each window is an arched shape, {{referred}} to as a lunette and above eight of the lunettes at the sides of the chapel are triangular <b>spandrels</b> filling the spaces between the side pendentives and the vault, the other eight lunettes each being below one of the corner pendentives.|$|E
5|$|Paint {{samples were}} {{analysed}} and {{photographs from the}} time of opening consulted, and the bridge was restored to its original appearance. The main body of the bridge was painted in dark green, with the <b>spandrels</b> decorated in gilding. The lamp standards, which had been removed during the Second World War, were replaced with replicas copied from the surviving posts at the ends of the bridge. A statue of James McNeill Whistler by Nicholas Dimbleby was erected {{at the north end of}} the bridge in 2005.|$|E
5|$|The chapel walls {{have three}} {{horizontal}} tiers with six {{windows in the}} upper tier down each side. There were also two windows at each end, but these have been closed up above the altar when Michelangelo's Last Judgement was painted, obliterating two lunettes. Between the windows are large pendentives which support the vault. Between the pendentives are triangularly shaped arches or <b>spandrels</b> cut into the vault above each window. Above {{the height of the}} pendentives, the ceiling slopes gently without much deviation from the horizontal. This is the real architecture. Michelangelo has elaborated it with illusionary or fictive architecture.|$|E

5|$|The {{spandrel}} {{plates were}} welded to the columns {{to create the}} modular pieces off-site at the fabrication shop. The modular pieces were typically 52inches (1.3m) deep, and extended for two full floors and half of two more floors. Adjacent modules were bolted together, with the splices occurring at mid-span of the columns and <b>spandrels.</b> The spandrel plates were located at each floor, transmitting shear stress between columns, allowing them {{to work together in}} resisting lateral loads. The joints between modules were staggered vertically, so the column splices between adjacent modules were not at the same floor.|$|E
5|$|Wain's Hotel, 310 Princes St (Category I). Built in 1879 to {{a design}} by Mason & Wales, Wain's Hotel remains Dunedin's grandest hotel building, and {{reflects}} the opulence which followed the Central Otago Gold Rush of the 1860s. The interior has been substantially remodelled, but the exterior's Italianate Renaissance façade remains largely intact. This latter features much intricate work by mason George Munro, notably the figures found carved within the panelled <b>spandrels</b> {{and supporting the}} façade's oriel windows.|$|E
5|$|By 1507, however, Cairano's {{decorative}} lapidary work in {{the interior}} of the San Pietro in Oliveto became known as the third great achievement of the artist, after the Miracoli and the Loggia. The architectural scores that punctuate the sequence of the altar and the composition of the whole, however, are unrelated to Cairano's style. Rather, they are consistent with Sanmicheli, who indeed possessed the only workshop in town capable of engaging a work of this magnitude. Certainly the twelve Apostles in the <b>spandrels</b> in the arches of the nave are Cairano's work - the artist's hand is unmistakable. There is very poor and fragmentary documentation relating to this historic building that has come down to us.|$|E

5|$|Earlier restorations had {{all left}} their {{marks on the}} frescoes. To {{counteract}} the whitening caused by salination, animal fat and vegetable oil had been applied, which effectively made the salt crystals transparent, but left a sticky layer that accumulated dirt. An additional problem, most obvious in the small putti which hold the nameplates on the pendentives, was saltpetre seeping through small cracks and appearing as dark rings on the surface. Unlike the white crystalline salt deposits, this could not be removed and the staining was irreversible. Layers of varnish and glue had been applied to many areas. This had darkened and become opaque. Restorers had repainted details over the darkened areas in order to define the features of figures. This was particularly {{the case for the}} lunettes, <b>spandrels</b> and lower parts of the pendentives.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the antiquity of the font – probably the oldest piece visible in the church, aside from the Celtic crosses – the pulpit dates from 1879. It was presented by the Bishop of St David’s (the scholarly Basil Jones, bishop 1874–1897), in memory of his mother. It is in Beer stone ashlar Gothic, formed of a drum with two cusped panels with carved stone reliefs of Saints John and Paul by Hugh Stannus, with square rosettes and leaf-carving in <b>spandrels</b> flanking, and a Gothic column with a large capital for a book rest. Opposite this is the usual brass eagle lectern. Both pulpit and lectern are placed in the archway between crossing and nave.|$|E
5|$|Open-spandrel {{segmental}} arch bridge: The earliest known fully stone open-spandrel {{segmental arch}} bridge is the Zhaozhou Bridge in southern Hebei province, China, completed in 605 by the Sui Dynasty (581–618) engineer Li Chun. The bridge span is 37.5m (123ft) {{and the structure}} relatively light in weight due to the four semi-circular arch <b>spandrels</b> which allow for additional flood waters to pass through. Other Chinese bridges would be influenced by this design, such as the open-spandrel Yongtong Bridge of Zhaoxian, Hebei built in 1130, and the simple segmental arch Lugou Bridge built in 1698 (originally in 1189). The latter, located just west of Beijing and features eleven segmental arches.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{thought that the}} {{strength}} of columns with <b>spandrel</b> walls can be calculated by neglecting {{the effects of the}} walls where the thickness is less than 10 cm and the thickness ratio is less than l/ 6. But it has been reported in some recent papers that the strength with <b>spandrel</b> walls is affected by the ratio of wall height to column height and the ratio of thickness of wall to that of column. The shear force, required to fracture framed walls may differ due to concrete compressive strength and due to reinforcing volume in the wall. As a column with <b>spandrel</b> walls is a kind of framed wall, structural elements of concrete compressive strength and reinforcing bar- volume have to be considered. Accordingly, the authors performed the experimental studies on the effect of above-mentioned structural elements on the strength of columns with <b>spandrel</b> walls. The results were as follows. 1. The strength of columns with <b>spandrel</b> walls must not be calculated by neglecting the effects of the walls where the thickness ratio is less than 1 / 6. 2. The reinforcing bar-volume in the wall and the transverse reinforcing bar-volume in the column have effects on the strength of column with <b>spandrel</b> walls...|$|R
50|$|Bridge No. 455 is a {{historic}} open <b>spandrel</b> concrete bridge, carrying Connecticut Route 159 across Stony Brook in southern Suffield, Connecticut. Completed in 1929, {{it is one of}} six surviving open <b>spandrel</b> concrete bridges in the state. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.|$|R
5000|$|The arch is {{a closed}} <b>spandrel,</b> {{in which the}} {{structural}} load of the deck is carried to the arch ribs via <b>spandrel</b> walls. It has a radius of 30 ft, and its vertical clearance of 29 ft is sufficient for vessels to navigate underneath. The deck is 16 ft wide, and spans 202 ft over the lake, anchored by reinforced concrete abutments. The concrete <b>spandrel</b> walls are marked to imitate the voussoir layout common to stone arch bridges and the [...] "coursed stonework of stone masonry bridge abutments".|$|R
5|$|The {{construction}} of {{the entrance to the}} Duomo of Salò is copiously documented between 1506 and 1509. The design was by Cairano, most likely in collaboration with Antonio Mangiacavalli. Cairano's hand is evident in the figures of the Father, St. Peter and St. John the Baptist, leaving the Virgin to his collaborator, while the Angel of the Annunciation and two small busts in the <b>spandrels</b> appear to be a joint work. The architectural parts were accomplished by different stonemasons as recorded in the documents relating to the workshops, including Mangiacavalli's son. The portal was put in place by August 1508, and embellishments and other work ended at the beginning of 1509.|$|E
5|$|The {{iconography}} {{of the ceiling}} has had various interpretations in the past, some elements {{of which have been}} contradicted by modern scholarship. Others, such as the identity of the figures in the lunettes and <b>spandrels,</b> continue to defy interpretation. Modern scholars have sought, as yet unsuccessfully, to determine a written source of the theological program of the ceiling and have questioned {{whether or not it was}} entirely devised by the artist himself, who was both an avid reader of the Bible and a genius. Also of interest to some modern scholars is the question of how Michelangelo's own spiritual and psychological state is reflected in the iconography and the expression of the ceiling. One such speculation is that Michelangelo was tormented by conflict between homosexual desires and passionate Christian beliefs.|$|E
5|$|The main {{components}} of the design are nine scenes from the Book of Genesis, of which five smaller ones are each framed and supported by four naked youths or Ignudi. At either end, and beneath the scenes are the figures of twelve {{men and women who}} prophesied the birth of Jesus. On the crescent-shaped areas, or lunettes, above each of the chapel's windows are tablets listing the Ancestors of Christ and accompanying figures. Above them, in the triangular <b>spandrels,</b> a further eight groups of figures are shown, but these have not been identified with specific Biblical characters. The scheme is completed by four large corner pendentives, each illustrating a dramatic Biblical story.|$|E
