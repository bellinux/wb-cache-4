50|$|In {{his book}} Mere Christianity C. <b>S.</b> Lewis <b>mentions</b> that <b>before</b> {{becoming}} a Christian, {{the doctrine of}} penal substitution had seemed extremely unethical to him, and that while he had since {{found it to be}} less so, he nonetheless indicated a preference for a position closer to that of Athanasius, in which Christ's death is seen as enabling us to die to sin by our participation, and not as a satisfaction or payment to justice as such. He also stated, however, that in his view no explanation of the atonement is as relevant as the fact of the atonement. Lewis's The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe in his fantasy fiction series, The Chronicles of Narnia, depicts the king Aslan surrendering himself to Jadis the White Witch as a substitute for the life of Edmund Pevensie, which appears to illustrate a ransom or Christus Victor approach to the atonement.|$|R
