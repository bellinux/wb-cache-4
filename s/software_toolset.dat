We illustrate practical benefits from this approach through the use of examples drawn from a methodology that has been used to develop successful safety-critical applications. Integration limits the number of different specifications that have to be developed and also typically results in improved traceability from requirements through to code. We also show that integration may reduce the burden imposed by formal verification. Integrated <b>software</b> <b>toolsets</b> are a natural consequence.

The first step of this research effort was to understand how rotorcraft impact the environment, with the initial focus on air pollution. Second, similar baseline helicopters were developed for a passenger transport mission, using NASA and ONERA rotorcraft design software tools. Comparisons were made between the designs generated by the two tools. Finally, rotorcraft designs were generated targeting reduced environmental impact. The results show that a rotorcraft design that targets reduced environmental impact can be significantly different than one that targets traditional cost drivers, such as fuel burn and empty weight...|$|R

40|$|Clinical {{research}} with medical imaging typically involves large-scale data analysis with interdependent <b>software</b> <b>toolsets</b> tied {{together in a}} processing workflow. Numerous, complementary platforms are available, {{but these are not}} readily compatible in terms of workflows or data formats. Both image scientists and clinical investigators could benefit from using the framework which is a most natural fit to the specific problem at hand, but pragmatic choices often dictate that a compromise platform is used for collaboration. Manual merging of platforms through carefully tuned scripts has been effective, but exceptionally time consuming and is not feasible for large-scale integration efforts. Hence, the benefits of innovation are constrained by platform dependence. Removing this constraint via integration of algorithms from one framework into another is the focus of this work. We propose and demonstrate a light-weight interface system to expose parameters across platforms and provide seamless integration. In this initial effort, we focus on four platforms Medical Image Analysis and Visualization (MIPAV), Java Image Science Toolkit (JIST), command line tools, and 3 D Slicer. We explore three case studies: (1) providing...|$|R
