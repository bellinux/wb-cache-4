Off-line identification method {{is based on}} the use of the Inverse Dynamic Identification Model (IDIM) which takes into account a <b>spring</b> <b>balancer</b> for gravity compensation and linear Least Squares (LS) technique to estimate the parameters from the positions and joint torques. It is key to get accurate values of joint drive gains to get accurate identification because the joint torques are calculated as the product of the current reference by the joint drive gains. Recently a new method validated on small payload robots (less than 10 Kg) allows to identify simultaneously all joint drive gains and dynamic parameters. This method {{is based on the}} Total Least Squares (TLS) solution of an over-determined linear system obtained with the inverse dynamic model calculated while the robot is tracking reference trajectories without load and trajectories with a known payload fixed on the robot. This method is used to identify accurately the heavy industrial robot Kuka KR 270 (270 Kg payload) with its <b>spring</b> <b>balancer.</b> This is a new step to promote a practical and easy to use method for global dynamic identification of any small or heavy gravity compensated industrial robots that does not need any a priori data, which are too often missing from manufacturer's data sheet...|$|E
40|$|A new robotic {{grinding}} {{process has been}} developed for a low-powered robot system using a <b>spring</b> <b>balancer</b> as a suspension system. To manipulate a robot-arm in the vertical plane, a large actuator torque is required due to the tool weight and enormous gravity effect. But the actuators of the robot system always exhibit a limited torque capacity. This paper presents a cheap and available system for precise grinding tasks by a low-powered robot system using a suspension system. For grinding operations, to achieve position and force-tracking simultaneously, this paper presents an algorithm of the hybrid position/force-tracking scheme {{with respect to the}} dynamic behavior of a <b>spring</b> <b>balancer.</b> Material Removal Rate (MRR) is developed for materials SS 400 and SUS 304. Simulations and experiments have been carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{proposes a}} new servo control method {{referred}} to as “passive dynamic control (PDC), ” {{which is based on}} the analysis of human walking mechanism. The PDC uses the passive balancing method jointly with the active control, and realizes the purpose control and the disturbance suppression control with much less energy and much more safety than conventional control methods. The servo system, which uses balancing operations, such as mechanical positioning control, is {{referred to as}} “balance servo. ” In this paper, the balance servo by the PDC is described, and its application for the positioning control using the <b>spring</b> <b>balancer</b> and the Magneto-Rheological brake is shown.

40|$|The {{tensioning}} device {{is designed to}} pull the contact wire straight at all times. Pulling a contact wire straight ensures that smooth contact is maintained at all times between the contact wire and pantograph of an electric train, and this {{makes it possible to}} ensure a stable supply of electricity to the train. Normally, {{tensioning device}} are installed at two positions over a distance of 1 to 1. 6 km per line. Fig. 1 shows a conceptual view {{of the relationship between the}} contact wire and pulley type balancer. The tensioning device can be broadly classified into the two types; the wheel type tensioning device that pulls the contact wire by concrete or iron weights and the spring type tensioning device that use the force of a spring to pull it. Fig. 2 shows the wheel type balancer, while Fig. 3 represents the <b>spring</b> type <b>balancer.</b> The <b>spring</b> type tensioning device comprises a spring and a sleeve for accommodating the spring. Only the sleeve portion is visible to the outside. The wheel depends on gravity acting on the weight to produce tension, so it is possible to pull the contact wire at an almost uniform force, regardless of the height of the weight. In the spring type The wheel type tensioning device used in the Tohoku and Joetsu Shinkansen lines of JR East requires much time and labor for maintenance including wire replacement and oil application. Further, parts become superannuated and in need of periodic replacement very quickly. So we found it necessary to develop a new type of maintenance-free tensioning device. To accomplish this, we have been making efforts since 1999 to develop a new spring type tensioning device for Shinkansen, making effective use of the <b>spring</b> type <b>balancer</b> technologies used in the narrow gauge lines, where the major target is to develop a maintenance-free tensioning device. Thus, fairly satisfactory development results have been attained. This paper introduces and discusses this development...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a simple and}} available system for manipulation of heavy tools by low powered manipulator for industrial applications. In the heavy manufacturing industries, sometimes, heavy tools are employed for different types of work. But the application of robots with heavy tools is not possible due to the limited torque limits of actuators. Suspended tool systems (STS) have been proposed to manipulate heavy tools by low powered robot-arm for this purpose. A low powered five-bar direct-drive parallel manipulator is designed and constructed to manipulate heavy tools suspended from a <b>spring</b> <b>balancer.</b> The validity, usefulness, and effectiveness of the suspended tool system are shown by experimental results. <br /...|$|E
