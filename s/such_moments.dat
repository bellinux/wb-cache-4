5|$|Prior to the 16th century, the Lords was the {{stronger}} {{of the two}} houses of Parliament. A process of gradual developments combined with <b>such</b> <b>moments</b> of crisis as the English Civil Wars transferred the political control of England, first from the Crown to the House of Lords {{and then to the}} House of Commons. The rising wealth of the Commons eventually allowed it to wage two civil wars, dethrone two Kings, and gradually reduce the power of the Lords. Prior to the House of Lords Act 1999, the power of the Lords had been diminished by the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 which stripped the Lords of the ability to block, or veto, adoption of most bills; at most it could delay bills for one year. Furthermore, the Commons has absolute power when it comes to money bills.|$|E

The Untouchables finale shoot out in the train station is a clear borrow from the Odessa Steps sequence in Sergei Eisenstein's The Battleship Potemkin. The main plot from Rear Window was used for Body Double, while it also used elements of Vertigo. Vertigo was also the basis for Obsession. Dressed to Kill was a note-for-note homage to Hitchcock's Psycho, including <b>such</b> <b>moments</b> as the surprise death of the lead actress and the exposition scene by the psychiatrist at the end.|$|E

Their eyes may actually close, their bodies tend to become immobile (a form of catalepsy), certain reflexes (e.g., swallowing, respiration, etc.) may be suppressed, and they seem momentarily oblivious to their surroundings until they have completed their inner search on the unconscious level for the new idea, response, or frames of reference that will restabilize their general reality orientation.

25|$|As a teenager, he {{was greatly}} {{troubled by the}} Metaphysics of Aristotle, which he could not {{understand}} until he read al-Farabi's commentary on the work.

In <b>such</b> <b>moments</b> of baffled inquiry, he would leave his books, perform the requisite ablutions, then go to the mosque, and continue in prayer till light broke on his difficulties. Deep into the night, he would continue his studies, and even in his dreams problems would pursue him and work out their solution. Forty times, it is said, he read through the Metaphysics of Aristotle, till the words were imprinted on his memory; but their meaning was hopelessly obscure, until one day they found illumination, from the little commentary by Farabi, which he bought at a bookstall for the small sum of three dirhams.

500|$|The {{gameplay}} requires little interaction {{from the}} player {{as most of}} the duration of the game is spent simply reading the text that appears on the game screen which represents either dialogue between the various characters or the inner thoughts of the protagonist.

The time between these decision points is variable and can occur anywhere from a minute to much longer. The game pauses at <b>such</b> <b>moments</b> and depending on which choice the player makes, the plot will progress in a specific direction.

White criticised the new layout's negative effect on gameplay and the poor enemy AI, and Kasavin called the experience [...] "frustrating, difficult, and tedious", though stating that <b>such</b> <b>moments</b> stood out because many areas of the game were [...] "thrilling". Reed found the controls dated and the stealth mechanics and strength upgrade system unnecessary, while the GamesRadar reviewer cited both the gameplay and control layout as dated, citing the difficulty of effectively controlling Lara at multiple points in the game because of these issues. The camera was also criticised, with White, Perry, Reed, Kasavin and the GamesRadar reviewer all citing it as awkward to control and sometimes wayward or confusing during its scripted movements.|$|E

Wilde and Douglas walked out in a huff, Wilde saying [...] "it is at <b>such</b> <b>moments</b> as these that one sees who are one's true friends". The scene was witnessed by George Bernard Shaw who recalled it to Arthur Ransome {{a day or so}} before Ransome's trial for libelling Douglas in 1913. To Ransome it confirmed what he had said in his 1912 book on Wilde; that Douglas's rivalry for Wilde with Robbie Ross and his arguments with his father had resulted in Wilde's public disaster; as Wilde wrote in De Profundis. Douglas lost his case. Shaw included an account of the argument between Harris, Douglas and Wilde in the preface to his play The Dark Lady of the Sonnets.|$|E
500|$|Writing for The New Republic, James Wood {{classified}} Middlesex {{as a story}} {{written in}} the vein of hysterical realism.

Woods also pointed out the seeming coincidences that involved locales. Smyrna is the burning city from which she flees to start a new life; New Smyrna Beach is where she spends her retirement. Effectively serving as a double entendre, {{the title of the book}} refers to the name of the street where Cal stays at and describes his situation: a hermaphrodite brought up as a girl but who decides to become a boy. Cal's condition is also reflected in his choice of locale to narrate the novel: Berlin is a city formerly of [...] "two halves or sexes" [...] (East and West).|$|E

500|$|In 531 career {{professional}} games, Cook scored 183 goals and 335 points. He {{was also an}} early innovator of the slapshot and of the drop pass. According to Cook: [...] "I had a dream about the drop pass one night and at our next practice, I told Frank and Bill about it. They thought I was crazy, but they decided to humour me. By gosh, it worked! I'd cross over from left wing to centre as I moved in on defense. I'd fake a shot and leave the puck behind and skate away from it, with Frank or Bill picking it up. We {{got a lot of}} goals off the crisscross and drop pass." [...] Ed Sullivan, then of the New York Graphic, praised Cook's creativity: [...] "When Bun Cook is hot, {{he is one of the}} most amazing players in hockey. At <b>such</b> <b>moments,</b> he attempts plays that stagger the imagination." [...] In 1995, Cook was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame by the veterans committee. Often overshadowed by his linemates, he was the last member of the Bread Line to gain entry into the Hall, as he followed Bill (1952) and Frank Boucher (1958).|$|E

[...] As Tatiana grew into adulthood, she {{undertook}} more public appearances than her sisters and headed committees. Vyrubova recalled that she became better known to the public than her three sisters because of her attention to duty and her ability to engage those she met. In their memoirs, both her mother's friend, Vyrubova, and lady in waiting Lili Dehn recalled that Tatiana, the most social of the sisters, longed for friends her own age but her social life was restricted by her rank and her mother's distaste for society. She also had a more introspective side, known only to her closest friends and family. [...] "With her, as with her mother, shyness and reserve were accounted as pride, but, once you knew her and had gained her affection, this reserve disappeared and the real Tatiana became apparent," [...] Dehn recalled. [...] "She was a poetical creature, always yearning for the ideal, and dreaming of great friendships which might be hers." ...|$|E
500|$|In general, Final Fantasy VIII {{has been}} {{compared}} favorably to its predecessors. Though questioning the game's lack of voice overs for its characters, Game Revolution praised its storyline and ending. For their part, Edge labeled Final Fantasy VIII [...] "a far more accomplished game than FFVII". On the other hand, the magazine also felt that the game's length left its story unable to [...] "offer consistently strong dialogue and sub-plots". Additionally, it found some of the story's plot twists [...] "not... suitably manipulated and prepared", leaving it [...] "hard not to greet <b>such...</b> <b>moments</b> with anything but indifference". Overall, Edge considered Final Fantasy VIII to be [...] "yet another outstanding edition of SquareSoft's far-from-final fantasies", summarizing it as [...] "aesthetically astonishing, rarely less than compelling, and near peerless in scope and execution". Electronic Gaming Monthly offered similar comments, stating that the game's character development [...] "is the best of any RPG's" [...] and that [...] "Final Fantasy VIII is the pinnacle of its genre." [...] UGO.com stated that while no other game in the series had stirred the controversy that Final Fantasy VIII had {{and that it was}} flawed, Final Fantasy VIII was a [...] "daring, groundbreaking game [...] decidedly the most original console-style RPG ever created". In 2002, IGN named the game the seventh best title for the PlayStation of all time, placing higher on the list than Final Fantasy VII and described as [...] " [...] all of its strong points, and [...] them better".|$|E

500|$|The {{painting}} was, for {{the most}} part, well received by art critics when first exhibited. A November 1963 Art Magazine review by Donald Judd described Whaam! {{as one of the}} [...] "broad and powerful paintings" [...] of the 1963 exhibition at Castelli's Gallery. In his review of the exhibition, The New York Times art critic Brian O'Doherty described Lichtenstein's technique as [...] "typewriter pointillism... that laboriously hammers out <b>such</b> <b>moments</b> as a jet shooting down another jet with a big BLAM". According to O'Doherty, the result was [...] "certainly not art, [...] time may make it so", depending on whether it could be [...] "rationalized... and placed in line for the future to assimilate as history, which it shows every sign of doing." [...] The Tate Gallery in London acquired the work in 1966, leading to heated argument amongst their trustees and some vocal members of the public. The purchase was made from art dealer Ileana Sonnabend, whose asking price of £4,665 (£ in [...] currency) was reduced by negotiation to £3,940 (£ in [...] currency). Some Tate trustees opposed the acquisition, among them sculptor Barbara Hepworth, painter Andrew Forge and the poet and critic Herbert Read. Defending the acquisition, art historian Richard Morphet, then an assistant keeper at the Tate, suggested that the painting addresses several issues and painterly styles at the same time: [...] "history painting, Baroque extravagance, and the quotidian phenomenon of mass-circulation comic strips." [...] The Times in 1967 described the acquisition as a [...] "very large and spectacular painting". The Tate's director, Norman Reid, later said that the work aroused more public interest than any of its acquisitions since World War II.|$|E
500|$|Before Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days was released, 1UP.com {{featured}} Roxas {{at the top}} {{of their}} [...] "Why You Should Care About Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days" [...] feature, calling him [...] "The darling of fanfiction and doujinshi writers everywhere," [...] and commenting on what he does during his only year within Organization XIII. Roxas' role as protagonist was described by G4TV as an attempt to [...] "satiate the ravenous fanboy" [...] due to the explanation from his background. While reviewing 358/2 Days, PALGN's Adam Ghiggino praised Roxas' development saying that even gamers who did not like his character in Kingdom Hearts II would care about him as [...] "he evolves from a self-described 'zombie' to a strong-willed and interesting character". Ghiggino especially noted his relationship with Xion and Axel, which he found charming despite the fact that they repeatedly meet {{at the top of}} a clock tower in many scenes. A similar response appeared in Game Informer, which commented that although such scenes were [...] "dull", Roxas' relation with Xion and Axel was appealing and the game's ending would make up for <b>such</b> <b>moments.</b> GamesRadar also commented that Roxas [...] "starts off like a zombie, but rapidly develops a personality" [...] during the title and joked about the numerous times he eats ice cream. His growth during the game was also picked as one of the most enjoyable elements of the title. IGN agreed, calling Roxas' friendship [...] "heart-aching". On the other hand, 1UP.com mentioned that although Roxas' relationship with Xion and Axel is appealing, some of his first missions feel like [...] "lonely, sad affairs". His maneuvers in the game were praised by GameSpot for being easy to learn despite how complex they look, while IGN liked the variation between them.|$|E
500|$|Love's Last Shift {{can be seen}} as {{an early}} sign of Cibber's {{sensitivity}} to shifts of public opinion, which was to be useful to him in his later career as manager at Drury Lane (see Colley Cibber). In the 1690s, the economic and political power balance of the nation tilted from the aristocracy towards the middle class after the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and middle-class values of religion, morality, and gender roles became more dominant, not least in attitudes to the stage. Love's Last Shift {{is one of the first}} illustrations of a massive shift in audience taste, away from the analytic bent and sexual frankness of Restoration comedy and towards the conservative certainties and gender role backlash of exemplary or sentimental comedy. The play illustrates Cibber's opportunism at a moment in time before the change was assured: fearless of self-contradiction, he puts something into his first play to please every section of the audience, combining the old outspokenness with the new preachiness. The way Vanbrugh, in his turn, allows the reformed rake to relapse quite cheerfully, and has the only preaching in the play come from the comically corrupt parson of [...] "Fatgoose Living", has made some early 20th-century critics refer to The Relapse as the last of the true Restoration comedies. However, Vanbrugh's play is also affected by the taste of the 1690s, and compared to a play like the courtier William Wycherley's The Country Wife of 20 years earlier, with its celebration of predatory aristocratic masculinity, The Relapse contains quite a few moments of morality and uplift. In fact it has a kind of parallel structure to Love's Last Shift: in the climactic scene of Cibber's play, Amanda's virtue reforms her husband, and in the corresponding scene of The Relapse, it reforms her admirer Worthy. <b>Such</b> <b>moments</b> have not done the play any favours with modern critics.|$|E
