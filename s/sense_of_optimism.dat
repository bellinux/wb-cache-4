5|$|Some {{essential}} {{features of}} Modernisme were: an anticlassical language inherited from Romanticism with {{a tendency to}} lyricism and subjectivity; the determined connection of architecture with the applied arts and artistic work that produced an overtly ornamental style; the use of new materials from which emerged a mixed constructional language, rich in contrasts, that sought a plastic effect for the whole; a strong <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>optimism</b> and faith in progress that produced an emphatic art that reflected the atmosphere of prosperity of the time, above all of the esthetic of the bourgeoisie.|$|E
5|$|On {{the kickoff}} {{following}} the field goal, Georgia head coach Mark Richt ordered an unorthodox onside kick. Surprised by the unexpected play, the Virginia Tech coverage team {{was unable to}} recover the ball, which was leapt upon by the kicker, Brian Mimbs. With a new chance at offense and a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>optimism</b> triggered by the successful onside kick, Georgia drove down the field. Aided by 20yards in penalties against Virginia Tech, the drive resulted in a six-yard touchdown pass to Martrez Milner. The touchdown and extra point boosted Georgia's morale and cut the score to 21–13, Virginia Tech leading by eight.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the previous season the Giants headed into the 1985 season with a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>optimism</b> after their successful 1984 campaign and a 5–0 pre-season record. The Giants went 10–6, and Taylor spearheaded a defense that led the NFL in sacks with 68. Taylor had 13. One of the more memorable plays of his career occurred during this season. On a Monday Night Football game against the Redskins, Taylor's sack of Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann inadvertently resulted in a compound fracture of Theismann's right leg. After the sack, a distraught Taylor screamed for paramedics to attend to Theismann. Although this sack ended Theismann's career, Theismann has never blamed Taylor for the injury. Taylor says {{he has never seen}} video of the play and never wants to. During {{the first round of the}} playoffs, the Giants defeated the defending champion 49ers 17–3, but lost to the eventual champion Chicago Bears in the second round 21–0.|$|E

Gordon McQueen opened the scoring late in the first half with a powerful header from a crossed free-kick from the left-hand side. Kenny Dalglish doubled Scotland's advantage with a scrambled effort, before England scored a late consolation goal from a penalty kick taken by Mick Channon.

40|$|This study {{examined}} whether healthier family dynamics {{were associated with}} higher personal strengths <b>of</b> resilience, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> coherence, and <b>optimism</b> among dementia caregivers in Argentina. Caregivers are usually required to assist individuals with dementia, and family members have typically fulfilled that role. Personal strengths such as resilience, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> coherence, and <b>optimism</b> {{have been shown to}} protect caregivers from some of the negative experiences of providing care, though the family-related variables associated with these personal strengths are largely unknown. Hierarchical multiple regressions investigated the extent to which family dynamics variables are associated with each of the caregiver personal strengths after controlling for demographic and caregiver characteristics. A sample of 105 caregivers from Argentina completed a set of questionnaires during a neurologist visit. Family dynamics explained 32 % of the variance in resilience and 39 % of the variance in <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> coherence. Greater family empathy and decreased family problems were uniquely associated with higher resilience. Greater communication and decreased family problems were uniquely associated with higher <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> coherence. <b>Optimism</b> was not found to be significantly associated with family dynamics. These results suggest that caregiver intervention research focused on the family may help improve caregiver personal strengths in Argentina and other Latin American countries...|$|R

25|$|In 1998, India {{carried out}} nuclear tests {{and a few}} days later, Pakistan responded with more nuclear tests giving both {{countries}} nuclear deterrence capability, although India had tested one hydrogen bomb which Pakistan lacked. Diplomatic tensions eased after the Lahore Summit was held in 1999. However, the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>optimism</b> was short-lived since in mid-1999 Pakistani paramilitary forces and Kashmiri insurgents captured the deserted, but strategic, Himalayan heights in the Kargil district of India. These had been vacated by the Indian army during the onset of the inhospitable winter and were supposed to be reoccupied in spring. The regular Pakistani troops who took control of these areas received important support, both in the form of arms and supplies, from Pakistan. Some of the heights under their control, which also included the Tiger Hill, overlooked the vital Srinagar-Leh Highway (NH 1A), Batalik and Dras.|$|E
25|$|The {{first half}} of Hoveyda's premiership {{is marked by a}} <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>optimism.</b> As already mentioned, in 1966, Hoveyda {{attempted}} to allure many elements of the intellectual community, as well as the opposition, into an informal agreement with the regime. Although talks between the two sides eventually broke down, Hoveyda never lost sight of what a partnership between the two could have accomplished. His pragmatic approach to politics allowed him to envision an incremental reform process that can be carried out through action. This is contrary to the path assumed by many Iranian intellectuals at the time, which involved quixotic solutions to problems such as electoral corruption and media censorship. Hoveyda resumed many of the reform initiatives set out by the Mansour administration. In particular, reform plans that were laid out by the Shah in the White Revolution. Although a secularist, he would even allocate government revenue to the clerical establishment. The clerical establishment was seen as a bulwark against Communism by the Shah, and was constantly reinforced (a policy that the Shah would later regret).|$|E

25|$|In 2000–01, the Mavericks {{improved}} {{further and}} finished with a 53–29 record, fueled by an offensive triangle of Nowitzki, Finley and Nash. The Mavs made a trade minutes before the trade deadline that sent Hubert Davis, Christian Laettner, Courtney Alexander, Loy Vaught, and Etan Thomas to the Washington Wizards for Juwan Howard, Calvin Booth and Obinna Ekezie. This move brought in fresh blood that secured the club's first playoff visit in 11 years. Also, Wang Zhizhi became the first Chinese player {{to play in the}} NBA, signing with the Mavs in January, along with the Eduardo Nájera, bringing Dallas an international cast that included Canada's Nash and Germany's Nowitzki. In the playoffs, the Mavericks won in the first round against the Utah Jazz, advancing to the second round {{for the first time since}} 1988. Even though they were eliminated by the San Antonio Spurs in five games, it marked a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>optimism</b> for Dallas in seriously contending for an NBA title. This was also the last season in the old Reunion Arena before making the move to the modern American Airlines Center.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{heading into}} the 2010 season with an overall <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>optimism,</b> the Browns started off poorly. They set an NFL record when they lost their first three games after leading in the fourth quarter. They finally won their first game against the Cincinnati Bengals in week 4. However, both Delhomme and Wallace injured their ankles over the first five games, forcing Colt McCoy to start in week 6 against the Steelers, though Mike Holmgren stated he would sit and learn the entire season. Though McCoy lost his first NFL start against the Steelers, {{he was able to}} win the {{following}} week when the Browns upset the defending Super Bowl champions, the New Orleans Saints. With this victory, the Browns defeated the defending Super Bowl Champions three years in a row, becoming the seventh NFL team to achieve this feat. The Browns continued this positive streak by outplaying the New England Patriots for a 34–14 victory in their next game. However, they lost to the New York Jets in overtime the following week, despite a late fourth-quarter, game-tying touchdown drive by McCoy. On January 3, 2011, after losing four games in a row to end the season, Holmgren and the Browns decided to fire head coach Eric Mangini, who posted a record of 10–22 in his two seasons as head coach. Eleven days later, Holmgren signed St. Louis Rams offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur to become the new head coach, and former Buffalo Bills and Chicago Bears head coach Dick Jauron as their defensive coordinator.|$|E

Although certainly not originaal with us, we do feel that the phrasing imparts a more appropriate <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> moderate <b>optimism</b> by suggesting more than a waking day, yet somewhat less then a lifetime - a quality which, with some care in usage, can hopefully be produced for a considerable time to come...|$|R
40|$|The International Symbol of Access (ISA) produces, capacitates, and debilitates {{disability}} {{in particular}} ways and is grounded by a happy affective {{economy that is}} embedded within neoliberal capitalism.

40|$|Based on {{a sample}} of 2036 college {{students}} at a large Southeastern university, learner self-regulation {{was found to be}} significantly related to four of the big five traits: agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness—as well as five narrow personality traits: <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> identity, <b>optimism,</b> tough-mindedness, work drive, and major satisfaction. The purpose was to examine self-regulation in relationship to other personality traits, vocational interests, and demographic variables. It was suggested that other personality traits may be influencing learner self-regulation. The results provide empirical support for SRL as a personality trait and for its multiple connections to the Big Five and narrow personality traits. Based on the present findings, we can characterize self-regulating learners as more likely than their more traditional peers to be hard-working, open to new learning, satisfied with their academic major, having a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> identity, optimistic, conscientious, emotionally stable, and agreeable. Results were discussed in terms of theoretical and methodological implications. Keywords:personality, traits, learner self-regulation, self-direction, learning style...|$|R

500|$|The {{effect of}} being {{shuttled}} {{into and out}} of the homes of family members led to a feeling of not being wanted, which made Washington extremely shy as a youth. The only time he recalls feeling a sense of self-worth was when his great-grandmother on his father's side had the pair for a while. [...] According to Washington, she loved the boys but was extremely strict, domineering, and at times, physically abusive.

As a small child, Washington said that he had no recollections of ever being hugged, and only felt close to his younger brother, Chris. Washington was a poor student who hated school throughout most of his childhood. He had to retake many of his classes in summer school to raise his grades. When he entered high school he played football merely so he could be around a close friend, and have someone to walk home with at night as he was terrified of walking home alone.|$|E
