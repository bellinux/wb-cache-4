40|$|Background. The {{induction}} of neutralizing antibodies against conserved {{regions of}} the human immunodeficien-cy virus type 1 (HIV- 1) envelope protein is a major goal of vaccine strategies. We previously identified 3 S, a critical conserved motif of gp 41 that induces the NKp 44 L ligand of an activating NK receptor. In vivo, anti- 3 S antibodies protect against the natural killer (NK) cell–mediated CD 4 depletion that occurs without efficient viral neutralization. Methods. <b>Specific</b> <b>substitutions</b> within the 3 S peptide motif were prepared by directed mutagenesis. Virus pro-duction was monitored by measuring the p 24 production. Neutralization assays were performed with immune-purified antibodies from immunized mice and a cohort of HIV-infected patients. Expression of NKp 44 L on CD 4 + T cells and degranulation assay on activating NK cells were both performed by flow cytometry. Results. Here, we show that <b>specific</b> <b>substitutions</b> in the 3 S motif reduce viral infection without affecting gp 41 production, while decreasing both its capacity to induce NKp 44 L expression on CD 4 + T cells and its sensitivity to autologous NK cells. Generation of antibodies in mice against the W 614 specific position in the 3 S motif elicited a capacity to neutralize cross-clade viruses, notable in its magnitude, breadth, and durability. Antibodies against this 3 S variant were also detected in sera from some HIV- 1 –infected patients, demonstrating both neutralization activity and protection against CD 4 depletion. Conclusions.
