6000|$|... 'Come!' <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>quietly</b> to Siegmund, {{no longer}} resenting the {{completeness}} of his happiness, which left her unnecessary to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I presume, Mr. Hurd," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>quietly,</b> [...] "that amongst your father's private papers {{you did not}} {{discover}} anything--unexpected?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Madame de Melbain and {{my brother}} were friends," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>quietly.</b> [...] "There were {{obstacles}} or {{they would have been}} more than friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Garth was {{surprised}} to see Fred at this hour, but surprise was not a feeling that she was given to express, and <b>she</b> only <b>said,</b> <b>quietly</b> continuing her work-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did {{you hear}} me?" [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> still <b>quietly</b> and rapidly, {{and without the}} least fretfulness or impatience. [...] "I asked {{if that was the}} way to London." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I feel so alone," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> very <b>quietly,</b> {{almost to}} herself. Something seemed {{to break in}} Jimmy's head. His brain {{suddenly}} cleared. He took a step forward.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>quietly,</b> [...] "that's {{just what}} it is. It has grown on me, little by little; I can't help liking Miss Henley." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tricks? I don't understand!" [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>quietly,</b> {{for she was}} not afraid. The {{passport}} was en regle: {{she knew}} she had nothing to fear.|$|E
6000|$|... "Smoke your {{cigar in}} peace," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>quietly.</b> [...] "I am settled {{here for a}} quiet talk. Has {{anything}} been heard of Wilfred yet?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lance," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> very <b>quietly,</b> [...] "my {{aunt was}} wiser than I was, {{but she was}} mistaken. What she gave you out of her wide charity was already yours by right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “You will excuse me, Hester,” <b>she</b> <b>said</b> very <b>quietly.</b> “I think I would sooner {{walk home}} alone. I will not {{ask you to}} {{remember}} that what you heard concerns only Tony and me.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Flora Schuyler {{placed her}} back to the door, and raised her hand. [...] "No," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> very <b>quietly.</b> [...] "It would be better if I went in place of you. Sit down, and don't lose your head, Hetty!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The consequences,' <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>quietly,</b> 'are {{simply that}} I shall lose 'em. As I have {{none in the}} house or garden, they can't touch me personally.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You mustn't disturb {{your friends}} on my account," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>quietly.</b> She {{did not look}} up, but Trent felt keenly the {{alteration}} in her manner.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} take this to Miss Thurwell, and tell her that I am waiting, I think that she will see me," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>quietly.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "You are lying," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> quite <b>quietly.</b> [...] "You don't {{want me to}} {{come down}} to see a window. It is {{something}} else. I warn you we are Evangelicals. We don't believe in prayers for the dead. 'As the tree falls--'" ...|$|R
60|$|All of this <b>she</b> <b>said</b> so <b>quietly</b> {{and in so}} {{soft and}} modest a way, though her words were not modest, and yet so bitterly, that every {{syllable}} cut me to the heart, and angered me till I could find no speech.|$|R
6000|$|There {{was nothing}} to colour about, and yet Marjorie felt the warm flow in neck and cheek and brow. She threw {{extraordinary}} quantities of candour into her manner. [...] "I had a romantic adventure," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> rather <b>quietly.</b> [...] "I {{was going to tell}} you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Unconsciousness comes {{quickly at}} this altitude," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>quietly.</b> [...] "Unless you are {{inviting}} death {{for us all}} you had best drop, and that quickly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Madame de Melbain {{would like}} to talk to you for a few moments," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>quietly.</b> [...] "Afterwards will you come on to the terrace?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sorry, Béla," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>quietly,</b> [...] "but I {{have promised}} Fehér Károly and also Jenö. They would be {{disappointed}} if I broke my promise." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> looking <b>quietly</b> up at him, [...] "as your {{conscience}} is growing so susceptible, you will think {{it right to}} restore that paper to my little cousin. Those are wonderful eyes, of hers, you know, now she has learnt to use them a little." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have asked}} me what you are to wait for," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> to Horace, <b>quietly</b> and firmly. [...] "Wait to hear {{something}} more of Mercy Merrick." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are making}} a mistake, Citizen," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> very <b>quietly.</b> [...] "I am Citizeness Candeille's maid. She gave me the {{passport}} herself, just before I left for England; if you will ask her the question, she will confirm what I say, and she assured {{me that it was}} quite en regle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought it}} best," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>quietly.</b> [...] "You see, I am {{not quite sure}} what the {{immediate}} future of this menage is going to be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{a flower}} I {{do not care}} for, Lumley," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>quietly.</b> [...] "The perfume is too faint. Besides, they are so suggestive of funerals." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is very {{wonderful}} to think about," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>quietly.</b> [...] "I {{am going to}} try and be Julian's secretary--whilst we are away, at any rate." ...|$|E
6000|$|She gave {{a little}} shriek and start; and then <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> quite <b>quietly,</b> [...] "Babies in the sea? Well, perhaps it is the happiest place for them;" [...] and waved her hand to Tom, and cried, [...] "Wait a little, darling, only a little: and perhaps we shall go with you and be at rest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{your mother}} {{had asked me}} that question," [...] she {{retorted}} with spirit, [...] "I should have {{told her that he}} was the man who got me safely out of the theatre after you...." [...] She checked herself. She did not want to say the unforgivable thing. [...] "You see," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> more <b>quietly,</b> [...] "you had disappeared...." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{company did}} not laugh at him; his moustaches were {{too long and}} too gray for that: but, after he was gone, they called him sentimental and so forth, all but one dear little old Quaker lady with a soul as white as her cap, who was not, of course, {{generally}} partial to soldiers; and <b>she</b> <b>said</b> very <b>quietly,</b> like a Quaker: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{all think}} that sometimes, child," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>quietly.</b> [...] "We {{all have our}} foolish moments and our hours of repentance, even the wisest of us!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Hamel," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>quietly,</b> [...] "I {{dare say}} that even during these few days you have {{realised}} that Mr. Fentolin is a very peculiar man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Billow is out, and I want to {{have some}} talk with you alone, Mr. Billow," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>quietly,</b> sitting down {{opposite}} to the old man.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You have {{disappointed}} me,' <b>she</b> <b>said</b> very <b>quietly,</b> {{but with}} a look which the courier's wife had never seen in her face before. 'Knowing what you know, {{you ought to be}} aware that it is impossible for me to communicate with Lord Montbarry. I always supposed you had some delicacy of feeling. I am sorry to find that I have been mistaken.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{obliged to}} you, sir, for your opinion," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> very <b>quietly</b> and firmly. [...] "I am {{determined}} {{to try the}} operation. If it does fail, it will only leave me what I am now. If it succeeds, {{it gives me a}} new life. I will bear anything, and risk anything, on the chance that I may see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have not}} pained me," [...] said Olive, [...] "but {{it is right}} that I should {{say to you that}} I do not love you." [...] <b>She</b> <b>said</b> this very <b>quietly</b> and gently, but there was sadness in her tones.|$|R
