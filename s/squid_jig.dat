50|$|Fishermen cut {{and gather}} the larger, lower fronds from palm trees which they then weave into large flat rafts. The rafts are pulled out to sea, usually {{with the small}} {{traditional}} fishing boats known as Luzzu, but can also be pulled out to sea by using larger modern fishing boats. Around midday, lampuki school underneath the rafts, seeking the shade. The fishermen first stay 5-10 metres away from the raft and repeatedly go around the raft pulling a silicone <b>squid</b> <b>jig</b> behind them until they catch something; they then leave the lampuka (dorado, mahi-mahi) hanging {{off the side of}} the boat until other fish come and school next to it; then a mesh net is thrown over the schooling fish. This method is known as kannizzati and has not changed significantly since Roman times. The lampuki are used both for local consumption as well as export.|$|E
40|$|The {{comparative}} {{sustainability of}} seven Tagus estuary fisheries – beam trawl, boat dredge, nets for glass eel, gill nets, eel basket, <b>squid</b> <b>jig</b> and octopus traps – is analysed using RAPFISH. This technique relies upon ordination of scored attributes, grouped in fields that cover ecological, economic, social, technological and ethical sustainability, performed using multi-dimensional scaling. Fisheries were analysed within each discipline and using all the attributes for an interdisciplinary approach. Leverage analysis {{is used to}} determine how much each attribute influences the ordination. Concerning the cross-discipline ordination, the studied fisheries lay around the mid-range of sustainability. The most sustainable fishery is octopus traps (57 %) followed by <b>squid</b> <b>jig</b> (56 %) that has the same results except for technological dimension. Eel basket and gill nets show the next best sustainability scores (55 % and 53 %, respectively). Glass eel fishery presents a poor sustainability (46 %), lying close to the boat dredge and beam trawl, the fisheries with lowest sustainability (44 % and 43 %, respectively). The low leverage values show that ordinations are truly multivariate and that the results are not dominated by any one attribute. More studies should be conducted on the Tagus estuary fisheries in order to get more information about resources, fishers and their activity, which will contribute to improve sustainability...|$|E
40|$|Summary of {{priority}} issues {{for managing the}} ecological effects of fishing in the Southern <b>Squid</b> <b>Jig</b> Fishery Assessment of the Southern <b>Squid</b> <b>Jig</b> Fishery (SSJF) at Level 1 (SICA – Scale Intensity Consequence Analysis) resulted in no species (target, byproduct, bycatch or protected (TEP)) components, habitats or communities requiring assessment at Level 2 (PSA – Productivity Sustainability Analysis). All 5 ecological components were eliminated at Level 1 (SICA) for the internal fishing activities. Risk scores of 1 or 2 only were recorded. There were no hazards assessed to have a risk score of 3 or above {{for any of these}} internal fishing activities. A risk score of 3 or above would have resulted in the need for Level 2 (PSA) analysis. 216 threatened, endangered or protected species are theoretically found within the waters of the fishery. These include 3 species of sharks/rays, 83 species of seabirds, 50 species of marine mammals and 67 species of bony fish. None of these species were assessed as at risk from commercial fishing operations in the SSJF. But as part of AFMA’s Ecological Risk Management process, we will take all reasonable steps to minimise interactions with those protected (TEP) species which are thought to occur {{in the area of the}} fishery...|$|E
40|$|Jigging with {{artificial}} lights (<b>squid</b> <b>jigging)</b> and deploying of large scale trap-net (also {{known as a}} set-net in Japan), are the major methods to capture Japanese common squid Todarodes pacificus in western Japan. <b>Squid</b> <b>jigging</b> is a highly selective fishing method. However, it consumes {{large amount of energy}} for steaming to the fishing ground and for lighting. In contrast, trap-net fishing requires substantially less energy but its capture efficiency is strongly influenced by its stationary mode of capture. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} analyze how various environmental and biological factors such as the lunar cycle, tidal condition, wind direction and squid abundance affect the capture efficiency of <b>squid</b> <b>jigging</b> and trap-net fishing. We analyzed the effect of these factors on squid catch in five Fisheries Cooperative Associations located on four islands in Nagasaki Prefecture, western Japan. Our analysis shows that <b>squid</b> catch in <b>jigging</b> and trap-net fishing is mainly influenced by the lunar cycle but also tide and wind direction play a marked role. In addition, squid abundance significantly affects the catches in trap-net fishing. Recommendations are made to improve the overall profitability of squid fishing by proper choice of the capture method, location and season...|$|R

40|$|Interactions between Australian {{fur seals}} (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus) and the Southern <b>Squid</b> <b>Jig</b> Fishery (SSJF) were {{investigated}} in April–May 2002. Details {{on the number}} of seals present, distance from the vessel, age and gender, and their behaviour were recorded using scan sampling techniques over 26 nights from eight vessels operating out of Portland and Port Fairy on the southwest coast of Victoria. Seals were observed on all nights but none were recorded in 30 % of all (777) scan observations. Of the seals attending vessels at any one time (1. 89 ± 0. 24), 67 % were involved in activities unrelated to jigging operations with the most common behaviour category being resting/grooming. Only 3. 6 % of observations involved seals targeting squid caught on jig lures whereas a further 29 % were of foraging on squid within 40 m of the vessel. Damage to fishing gear attributable to seals was recorded on only three occasions. There was no evidence of negative impacts on seals from vessel operations.

Detailed information of fishing operations were registered, along with the CPUE, catch, fishing effort, dorsal mantle dorsal length (DML) and other biological variables. The following results were obtained: (1) The number of crowns of jigs alone does not explain the variability in CPUE. (2) The quadratic and cubic method, showed significant equations of estimation significant for the CPUE. (3) Larger sizes of giant squid were captured with jigs 14 cm and 23 cm. (4) The stepwise multiple linear regression model was significant and shows the importance of including six independent variables to estimate the CPUE: N° of crowns, N° of h, Sea Surface Temperature (SST °C), DML (cm), distance to shore (mn) and shoal depth (m). (5) The model uses four independent variables, depth (m), TSM, number of crowns of the jig and distance from shore to estimate the dependent variable, the average size of the giant squid was found to be highly significant. (6) We found negative correlations between CPUE and the number of h, the shoal depth and distance from shore. (7) The average size of the giant squid was negatively associated with the number of h, depth, distance from shore and CPUE, and only positively correlated with the number of crowns.

40|$|In {{recent years}} in Japan, falling fish prices and rising fuel costs have worsened the {{economic}} conditions for many fisheries-dependent households. Many fishermen select the fishing ground in which they anticipate they can maximize their total catch, even when such grounds are far from their home harbor. As a result, fishermen {{have the potential to}} select a fishing ground in which they do not maximize their income. Especially the Japanese coastal <b>squid</b> <b>jigging</b> fishermen need to develop energy-saving <b>squid</b> <b>jigging</b> fishery practices, because of the high fuel consumption in comparison to other fisheries. By using the Management Simulation Method, we show that income fluctuations are caused by various factors. We used social factors and fishing ground factors in this simulation. According to the simulation results, small changes in social and fishing ground situations can result in changes in selection of the optimal fishing grounds. We conclude that the selection of fishing grounds by fishermen based only on their own knowledge and/or intuition might not result in choices that maximize their income, and it is necessary to develop objective methods to choose the fishing ground in which they can maximize their income...|$|R

In summer in the northern waters, squid boats of 19.

The relationship between fuel consumption (l) and energy (kW. h) during jigging with lamps was expressed as a linear regression containing effects of the boat size and the inherent character of each boat. Fuel consumption rate decreases on average 0. 28. l/kW. h by using LEDs with a reduced number of MHs. When 9. kW LEDs were employed with 24. MHs for 19.

5|$|How the ostensibly weak-swimming {{frilled shark}} captures active, {{fast-moving}} squid {{is a matter}} of speculation. One possibility is that it takes advantage of injured squid, or those that are exhausted and dying after spawning. Alternatively, it may surprise its prey by curving its body and, bracing itself with its posteriorly positioned fins, launching a quick strike forward {{in the manner of a}} snake. It may also be able to close its gill slits and create negative pressure to suck prey into its mouth. The many small, sharp, recurved teeth of the frilled shark are functionally similar to <b>squid</b> <b>jigs</b> and could easily snag the body or tentacles of a squid, particularly as they are rotated outwards when the jaws are protruded. Observations of captive frilled sharks swimming with their mouths open suggest that the small teeth, light against the dark mouth, may even fool squid into attacking and entangling themselves.|$|R

Generalized linear modeling analysis indicated that catch is explained by the fishing ability of the captain and crew of each boat, illuminated fraction of the moon (lunar phase) and presence of dolphin, with assuming monthly differences in squid abundance. Influences on lighting patterns of fishing lamps and number of operating boats around the boat that fishermen always have keen interests are not detected in the analysis. The factor of fishing ability of the captain and crew of the boat may be interrupted as the ability to search the promising fishing locations in the fishing ground. Furthermore, presence of dolphin showed a negative impact on catch. 2010 年 1 ～ 2 月に対馬海峡で操業を行ったイカ釣り漁船 9 隻が記録したスルメイカの日々の漁獲箱数，集魚灯の点灯数, イルカの出現状況, 自船 2 海里以内で操業する漁船数の資料を用いて, 一般化線型モデル解析を行った。漁獲箱数は月輝面比とイルカの有無および月ごとのスルメイカの現存量で船別に表現され, 漁業者が意識する集魚灯数と周囲の漁船数の影響は有意ではなかった。日々の漁獲が船ごとに表現されたことは，イカ釣り漁船の漁獲能力が集魚灯などの装備だけでなく, 操業位置の決定など乗員の技能の影響を受けたことを示唆している。本文データは学協会の許諾に基づきCiNiiから複製したものであ...|$|R

Previous research has shown the need for light stronger than LEDs (9 kW) and 36 MHs (108 kW) to catch the Japanese common squid Todarodes pacificus. We tested a stepwise lighting method termed "stage reduced lighting" in the Tsushima Strait in January and February 2010 using nine fishing boats. LEDs (9 kW) and 50 MHs (150 kW) were lit for 3. 9 h on average, and then the number of MHs was reduced to either 30 or 36 until the end of fishing (7. 3 h on average). This method reduced fuel consumption by 22 - 25 % compared to the continuous use of all fishing lamps (159 kW). We carried out a catch analysis of nine experimental boats and 21 commercial boats during the experimental period.

Morphometrics of the somatic and {{reproductive}} organ systems and the histological structure of the mantle in relation to maturation were examined. The data suggest that growth and maturation occur simultaneously during most of the time that lllex argentinus females are on the feeding grounds. In a squid of a ‘standard’ mantle length the whole body mass increases relative to mantle length during maturation and growth of the reproductive organs. This is accompanied by a small but significant decrease in the relative mass of the mantle, head and viscera whilst the mass of the digestive gland remains constant. Although mantle mass of a ‘standard’ female squid decreases relative to mantle length with maturity this is not associated with degeneration of the mantle muscles. Energy and nutrient resources for maturation are apparently derived from the squid's food, not from reserves, and during the course of maturation there is an increasing shift of emphasis from somatic growth to production of gonad and accessory reproductive organs...|$|R

During maturation the mantle and digestive gland mass showed no significant change relative to mantle length. The mass of the head increased and the mass of the viscera decreased relative to mantle length. In male Illex argentinus, as in the female, the energy and nutrient resources for maturation are derived from the squid's food and during the course of maturation there is an increasing shift of emphasis from somatic growth to production of gonad and accessory reproductive organs.

The LPUE for the domestic cephalopod fisheries for 1968 to 1976 showed an increasing trend and a nearly stable trend for 1985 to 1998.

A significant difference was revealed in the standardized beak and statolith variables between sexes in the northeast (NE) stock (P 0. 05), whereas the NW stock showed no significant difference in either sex for the statolith variables (P > 0. 05). The same sex also revealed different patterns with different hard structures between the two stocks. In t-tests females showed significant differences between stocks in statolith morphology (P 0. 05), but showed no difference between cohorts (P > 0. 05) in beak morphometric variables. With the combination of two standardized hard parts, correct classification of stepwise discriminant analysis (SDA) was raised by nearly 20 % compared with using only one structure, although overlaps of the NW stock were still found in the scatter-plots. It is concluded that adding more appropriate hard structure variables will effectively increase the success of separating geographic stocks by the SDA method...|$|R

5|$|Fishing {{operations}} for bigfin reef <b>squids</b> (particularly in <b>jigging)</b> are usually done {{at night and}} utilise bright lights, taking advantage of their attraction to illumination. They are especially abundant during the full moon and in foggy weather. Populations of bigfin reef squids are not seasonal, {{and they can be}} fished throughout the year.

40|$|The jumbo {{flying squid}} Dosidicus gigas is widely {{distributed}} in the eastern Pacific Ocean and supports an important fishery. Although many studies {{have been carried out}} on the biology of this species, limited biological information is available in the waters outside the Exclusive Economic Zone of Chile (EEZ) (20 °S- 41 °S and 74 ° 30 ’W- 84 °W). Three surveys were conducted in this area by the Chinese <b>squid</b> <b>jigging</b> vessels during the period from April 2006 to May 2008. The majority of the catch in the survey was from the two areas defined by 37 ° 30 ’- 41 °S and 78 ° 30 ’- 80 °W and by 25 °- 30 °S and 76 °- 77 ° 30 ’W. The sex ratio (M: F) of the catch was 1 : 2. 48. The mean mantle length (ML) was 376 mm for males with a range of 257 - 721 mm and 388. 7 mm for females with a range of 236 - 837 mm. Two distinguished size classes, medium- and large-sized groups, were identified in this study with the medium-sized group (350 - 450 mm ML) consisting of 89 % of the total catch. The sizes at first sexual maturity were 638 mm ML for females and 565 mm ML for males. This study suggests that all the individuals examined were hatched from March 2007 to February 2008, indicating that D. gigas might spawn all year around with a peak spawning time from November 2007 to January 2008. Most of the stomachs analyzed had food remains. The preys included three major groups: fish (mainly lanternfish), cephalopods and crustaceans, but D. gigas was the dominant species in the stomach contents, showing strong evidence of cannibalism. The information obtained from this study improves our understanding of the fishery biology of D. gigas off Chile...|$|R
40|$|Research PaperOver {{exploitation}} of the coastal fisheries resources in Southeast Asia region {{is the cause of}} many problems either conflict among the fishermen or depletion of the coastal environment. In order to find out the way to solve those problems, Set-Net fishing was proposed {{to be used as a}} kind of tool for the coastal fisheries management development. Set-Net does not function only to harvest fisheries resources but its construction also provided shelter and substrate for living marine organism to create their communities in the food chain of coastal marine ecosystem. Seven small scale fishermen groups of Mae Rumpheung beach which located on the east coast of the Gulf of Thailand, were selected as the experimental samples and site for case study in Thailand. Over two hundred fishermen have generally earned their lives on this coastal waters with seven types of fishing gears: crab bottom gillnet, crab trap, <b>squid</b> trap, <b>squid</b> <b>jigging,</b> fish trap, handlines and fish gillnet. Some commercial fishing boats from other area are also presently operated anchovy purse seine and anchovy fishing with light on this area. So that they should pay high responsibility on their own coastal resources and environmental conservation under the concept of decentralization policy. One set of set-net "Otoshi-ami" was constructed and installed at 14 meters depth fishing ground of coastal waters, five groups of fishermen were arranged for fishing operation alternately under control of the Set-net Operation Administrative and Management Committee. It could harvest various species of their coastal resources mainly yellowstrip scad, round herring, sardine, indian mackerel, Indo-Pacific mackerel and squid. There are also a lot of fishes and others marine organism gathering and living around and on the set-net construction both pelagic and demersal species. It is shown that the coastal resources communities were developed around the set-net area more than other empty area of this waters. So that, the vicinity area around set net construction is become a good fishing ground for small-scale fishing activities, however it should be managed by the committee or the cooperative in future...|$|R
40|$|Gonatus fabricii (hereafter gonatus) is a pelagic squid, widely {{distributed}} in boreal and subarctic waters. Material {{for the present}} investigation has been collected since 1970 mainly in the Norwegian Sea and adjacent areas during postlarval and 0 -group fish surveys during late summer and autumn. Earlier material used included stomach contents from hooded seals caught in the Jan Mayen area, and from bottlenose whales taken east of Iceland and off Labrador. Gonatus larvae were also taken in plankton net hauls at Station M at 66 ° 00 'N 02 ° 00 'E. Gonatus with mantle lengths 6 - 20 mm {{were found in the}} Norwegian Sea between December and July, 25 - 45 mm in February - September, and 55 - 100 mm in May - September and in December. Larger squid, mantle lengths 13 - 28 cm, were only taken from stomach contents of hooded seals and bottlenose whales. During 1978 gonatus with mantle lengths 15 - 45 mm were very abundant in the surface layers of the central and eastern Norwegian Sea during summer and autumn, up to 2000 specimens (5000 ml) were taken in half hour hauls with a Harstad trawl, 18 x 18 m opening. Juveniles also became stranded along the coast of eastern Finnmark in North Norway during the autumn. The correlation between rostral length (RL) of the beak and mantle length of gonatus has been roughly calculated. In stomach contents of bottlenose whales caught off Labrador during May - June 1967, the calculated mantle lengths of gonatus varied from 6 cm to 30 cm, mostly 13 - 28 cm. In the Norwegian Sea spawning and hatching of gonatus probably occur from December to July, with the peak in April - June. The main areas of spawning may coincide with localities where bottlenose whales are abundant as can be seen from catch statistics, e. q. off eastern Iceland, Møre, Vesterålen and West of Spitsbergen (Fig. 7). The life cycle of gonatus is probably closely connected to the current system of the Norwegian Sea and adjacent seas. A fishery for juvenile gonatus should be tried in these areas, chiefly during April - August, using trawls, lights and dip nets or pumps; for larger <b>squid,</b> <b>jigging</b> gear combined with lights should be used...|$|R
