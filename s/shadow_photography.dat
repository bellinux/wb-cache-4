40|$|Using <b>shadow</b> <b>photography,</b> we {{observed}} microsecond time scale evolution of multiple cavitation bubbles, excited by tighty focused femtosecond laser pulse in water under supercritical power regime (~ 100 Pcr). In these extreme conditions high energy delivery into the microvolume of liquid sample leads to creation of single filament which becomes {{a source of}} cavitation region formation. When aberrations {{were added to the}} optical scheme the hot spots along the filament axis are formed. At high energies (more than 40 uJ) filaments in these hot spots are fired and, as a result, complex pattern of cavitation bubbles is created. The bubbles can be isolated from each other or build exotic drop-shaped cavitation region, which evolution {{at the end of its}} life, before the final collapse, contains the jet emission. The dynamics of the cavitation pattern was investigated from pulse energy and focusing. We found that greater numerical aperture of the focusing optics leads to greater cavitation area length. The strong interaction between bubbles was also observed. This leads to a significant change of bubble evolution, which is not yet in accordance with Rayleigh model. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figure...|$|E

Combustion under different equivalence ratios (0. 2 w 1. 0), temperatures (298 K w 423 K) and pressures (1. 0 bar w 10. 0 bar) is visualized. The results show that flames experience both unequal diffusion and/or hydrodynamic instabilities at different stages of propagation. The critical flame radius for such instabilities is measured and correlated to the variations of equivalence ratio, temperature and pressure. Analysis revealed that equivalence ratio affects unequal diffusion instability via varying the Lewis number, Le; increased temperature can delay both types of instabilities in the majority of tests by promoting combustion rate and changing density ratio; pressure variation has minor effect on unequal diffusion instability but is responsible for enhancing hydrodynamic instability, particularly for stoichiometric and near-stoichiometric flames...|$|E

40|$|Consider a projector-camera setup where a {{sinusoidal}} {{pattern is}} projected onto the scene, and {{an image of}} the ob-jects imprinted with the pattern is captured by the camera. In this configuration, the local frequency of the sinusoidal pattern as seen by the camera is a function of both the fre-quency of the projected sinusoid and the local geometry of objects in the scene. We observe that, by strategically plac-ing the projector and the camera in canonical configuration and projecting sinusoidal patterns aligned with the epipolar lines, the frequency of the sinusoids seen in the image be-comes invariant to the local object geometry. This property allows us to design systems composed of a camera and mul-tiple projectors, which can be used to capture a single im-age of a scene illuminated by all projectors at the same time, and then demultiplex the frequencies generated by each in-dividual projector separately. We show how imaging sys-tems like those can be used to segment, from a single image, the shadows cast by each individual projector – an applica-tion that we call coded <b>shadow</b> <b>photography.</b> The method is useful to extend the applicability of techniques that rely on the analysis of shadows cast by multiple light sources placed at different positions, as the individual shadows cap-tured at distinct instants of time now can be obtained from a single shot, enabling the processing of dynamic scenes. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{propagation}} of weak shock waves (M_s = 1. 007, 1. 03 and 1. 1) through a statistically uniform random medium {{has been investigated}} experimentally in a shock tube. The wave-from geometry, rise time and amplitude of initially plane shocks which have propagated through a random mixture of helium and refrigerant 12 are measured. The effect of shock propagation on {{the properties of the}} random medium is visualized with schlieren and <b>shadow</b> <b>photography.</b> The pressure histories of the distorted shock waves reflecting from a normal end wall are observed to be both peaked and rounded. In the rounded case the perturbed shock is found to be made up of a succession of weak, slightly curved fronts with a total effective rise time orders of magnitude greater than the classical Taylor thickness. The radius of curvature of the weakest shocks after propagating through the random medium is inferred from observations at two downstream stations to be about 7 times the integral scale of the gas inhomogeneities. It is concluded that the observed distortions of the wave fronts can best be explained in terms of random focusing and defocusing of the front by the inhomogeneities in the medium. A ray-tracing calculation has been used to interpret the experimental observations. It is found that geometrical considerations are sufficient to account for many of the effects observed on the shocks...|$|E
40|$|Pre-breakdown {{phenomena}} in liquid nitrogen (LN 2), often referred as streamers, are the precursor of total breakdown {{due to the}} more conductive nature of density-change channels compared to the liquid. The paper characterizes streamer behavior in LN 2 under AC voltages using ultra high frequency (UHF) and radio frequency current transformer (RFCT) measurements. The aim is to further understand the role of LN 2 as insulation {{as well as the}} application of non-conventional partial discharge (PD) detection techniques in condition monitoring of future HTS devices. An experiment has been developed to measure PD events in LN 2 using narrowband and wideband methods simultaneously. PD detection following IEC 60270 standards allows measurement of the amount of charge transferred at the terminals while the use of a UHF senor with a bandwidth up to 3 GHz can provide better resolution in the time domain. Results from the UHF sensor show that PD in LN 2 appears in the form of multiple pulses which are suggested to be due to the expansion and collapse of the gaseous channels. The pulse burst phenomenon was not observed by the narrowband detection. Instead, a slowly damped signal was measured, which may result from the integration of multiple individual events. The experiment also allows correlation of PD measurements with images of pre-breakdown streamers using <b>shadow</b> <b>photography.</b> The characteristics of streamers in LN 2 are discussed based on the observation of the density-change channels together with the corresponding discharge signature...|$|E
