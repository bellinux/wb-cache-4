[...] By then Boulton had managed the business for several years, and thereafter expanded it considerably, consolidating operations at the Soho Manufactory, built by him near Birmingham. [...] At Soho, he adopted the latest techniques, branching into silver plate, ormolu and other decorative arts. He became associated with James Watt when Watt's business partner, John Roebuck, was unable to pay a debt to Boulton, who accepted Roebuck's share of Watt's patent as settlement. He then successfully lobbied Parliament to extend Watt's patent for an additional 17 years, enabling the firm to market Watt's steam engine. The firm installed hundreds of Boulton & Watt steam engines in Britain and abroad, initially in mines and then in factories.|$|E
2500|$|HASAG (also {{known as}} Hugo Schneider AG, or by its {{original}} name in [...] ) was a German metal goods manufacturer founded in 1863. Based in Leipzig, it grew {{from a small}} business making lamps and other <b>small</b> <b>metal</b> <b>products</b> by hand into a large factory and publicly traded company that sold its wares in several countries. During the Second World War, Hasag became a Nazi arms-manufacturing conglomerate with dozens of factories across German-occupied Europe using slave labour on a massive scale. Tens of thousands of Jews from Poland, and other prisoners, died producing munition for Hasag.|$|E
5000|$|In {{spite of}} the {{negative}} conditions and the pessimistic visions of the Norwegian Department of Interior ("The difficulty in competing with foreign factories means that industry will never succeed in this country"), by 1860 Ole Mustad led his company to a primary position {{in the production of}} <b>small</b> <b>metal</b> <b>products</b> like fencing wire, nails, pins, fish hooks, horseshoe nails, shipbuilding nails, paper clips, thumb tacks and a series of other metallic wire-based products. By refining and industrializing the manual production of fish hooks in 1877, the company managed to become a global market leader in just a few years.|$|E
5000|$|Boulton {{had turned}} his {{attention}} to coinage in the mid-1780s; they were just another <b>small</b> <b>metal</b> <b>product</b> like those he manufactured. He also had shares in several Cornish copper mines, and had a large personal stock of copper, purchased when the mines were unable to dispose of it elsewhere. However, when orders for counterfeit money were sent to him, he refused them: [...] "I will do anything, short of being a common informer against particular persons, to stop the malpractices of the Birmingham coiners." [...] In 1788 he established the Soho Mint as part of his industrial plant. The mint included eight steam-driven presses, each striking between 70 and 84 coins per minute. The firm had little immediate success getting a licence to strike British coins, but was soon engaged in striking coins for the British East India Company for use in India.|$|R

50|$|Industrial {{techniques}} and steam-power {{was introduced to}} coin manufacture by Matthew Boulton in Birmingham in 1788. By 1786, two-thirds of the coins in circulation in Britain were counterfeit, and the Royal Mint responded to this crisis by shutting itself down, worsening the situation. The industrialist Mathew Boulton {{turned his attention to}} coinage in the mid-1780s as an extension to the <b>small</b> <b>metal</b> <b>products</b> he already manufactured in his factory in Soho. In 1788 he established a Mint as part of his industrial plant. He invented a steam driven screw press in the same year (his original machinery was being used at the Royal Mint until 1881, almost a century later), which worked by atmospheric pressure applied to a piston. The piston was in communication with a vacuum vessel from which the air had been pumped by steam power.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{precious}} <b>metals</b> <b>products</b> {{are widely}} {{a point of}} interest {{for the majority of}} the medium and higher revenues population and the purchase of those kinds of products it's just starting to develop in Romania even if the price of the precious metals is still going up. In order to better understand the implication of precious <b>metals</b> <b>products</b> purchase it is important to shape the consumer buying behaviour. Therefore, a more thorough understanding of the consumers’ lifestyle and attitudes with respect to precious <b>metals</b> <b>products</b> is an imperative for producers and distributors. In a university level survey, based on an on-line questionnaire among medium and higher revenues persons it was intended to correlate the populations’ knowledge and attitude towards precious <b>metals</b> <b>products</b> in connection to their lifestyle. According to the research results that precious <b>metals</b> <b>products</b> are perceived as being sign ofwealth, associated with specificevents in thelives of people: engagement, wedding, sign of theevolution ofthe social ladder, appreciationwhengiven to someone, a safeinvestment considering the ever-increasing price. Still, the concept of precious <b>metal</b> <b>product</b> could not be well defined by the buyer.
