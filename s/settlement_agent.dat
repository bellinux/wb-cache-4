5000|$|The name 'la Rolanderie' became {{synonymous with}} the name of the district, until {{approximately}} 1890 when the St. Hubert parish was founded. It is possible, as Fr. Fallourd suggests, that the district was named Rolanderie because Lorin had decreed teat [...] "the colony.[...]was to be given the name." [...] The more convincing explanation is that the district was so named because the Rolanderie farm was both the first and the largest of the farms to be established. It moreover served as a half-way house for CPR land guides and prospective settlers: much to Meyer's chagrin, for he complained in one of his letters, [...] "I give them plentiful lodging and plentiful board without asking of either a cent." [...] While at 'la Rolanderie', Meyer seems to have acted as a <b>settlement</b> <b>agent</b> for a Societe Anonyme (Anonymous Society; the French term for limited-liability corporation). Fr. Fallourd writes that Meyer had been granted 100,000 francs (CA$20,000) by Lorin, a member of this organization, in order to establish a settlement on the Pipestone.The Doctor's job, according to Humphreys, probably included acquiring and subdividing land, helping the new settlers to build their homes, lending them money and machinery when necessary, and setting up small businesses. By 1889,when Meyer was replaced at Rolanderie by Count de Roffignac of Limousin, France, he had increased the holdings of the ranch to include large herds of bovine shorthorn cattle, purebred horses (bred for sale to the French army), and pigs, and had expanded the size of the farm to 4480 acre.

The parties involved share the ill-gotten gains and the mortgage eventually goes into default. In other cases, naive [...] "investors" [...] are lured into the scheme with the organizer's promise that the home will be repaired, repairs and/or renovations will be made, tenants will located, rents will be collected, mortgage payments made and profits will be split upon sale of the property, all without the active participation of the straw buyer. Once the loan is closed, the organizer disappears, no repairs are made nor renters found, and the [...] "investor" [...] is liable for paying the mortgage on a property that is not worth what is owed, leaving the [...] "investor" [...] financially ruined. If undetected, a bank may lend {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} against a property that is actually worth far less and in large schemes with multiple transactions, banks may lend millions more than the properties are worth.

40|$|Biofouling causes huge {{economic}} loss {{and a recent}} global ban on organotin compounds as antifouling agents has increased the need for safe and effective antifouling compounds. Five structurally similar compounds were isolated from the crude extract of a marine Streptomyces strain obtained from deep-sea sediments. Antifouling activities of these five compounds and four other structurally-related compounds isolated from a North Sea Streptomyces strain against major fouling organisms were compared to probe structure-activity relationships of compounds. The functional moiety responsible for antifouling activity lies in the 2 -furanone ring and that the lipophilicity of compounds substantially affects their antifouling activities. Based on these findings, a compound with a straight alkyl side-chain was synthesized and proved itself as a very effective non-toxic, anti-larval <b>settlement</b> <b>agent</b> against three major fouling organisms. The strong antifouling activity, relatively low toxicity, and simple structures of these compounds make them promising candidates for new antifouling additives. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

And the elastic availability of such promises to pay are the essential source of elasticity in the payment system. In some sense, the futures market works just the opposite from the credit market.

40|$|The poor {{record of}} {{economic}} convergence between the euro area and {{those countries that}} joined the European Union (EU) in May 2004 raises serious doubts about the possibility for the latter countries to adopt the European single currency in the not too distant future.

These efforts could lead to output and growth losses in these countries, which would run counter to their catching-up process with respect to the rest of the EU. To avoid a number of shortcomings elicited by the obligation to respect the convergence criteria in the short term, and also to avoid the financial instability risks implied by participation in the ERM II, this paper suggests an alternative plan for integrating the new EU countries monetarily. The plan consists in creating a European <b>settlement</b> <b>agent</b> in charge of the final payment of the new EU countries' international transactions. These transactions would be settled using an international monetary standard whose creation would eliminate instability on the foreign exchange market by its being the yardstick that the current international monetary system lacks.

40|$|Abstract: We {{study the}} {{relation}} between liquidity in financial markets and post-trading fees (i. e. clearing and settlement fees). The clearing and <b>settlement</b> <b>agent</b> (CSD) faces different marginal costs for different types of transactions. Costs are lower for an internalized transaction, i. e. when buyer and seller originate from the same broker. We study two fee structures that the CSD applies to cover its costs. The first is a uniform fee on all trades (internalized and non-internalized) such that the CSD breaks even on average. Traders then maximize trading rates and higher post-trading fees increase observed liquidity in the market. The second fee structure features a CSD breaking even by charging the internalized and non-internalized trades their respective marginal cost. In this case, traders face the following trade-off: address all possible counterparties {{at the expense of}} considerable post-trading fees, or enjoy lower post-trading fees by targeting own-broker counterparties only. This difference in post-trading fees drives traders'strategies and thus liquidity. Furthermore, across the two fee structures, we find that observed liquidity may differ from cum-fee liquidity (which encompasses the post-trading fees). With trade-specific fees, the cum-fee spread depends on the interacting counterparties. Next, regulators can improve welfare by imposing a particular fee structure. The optimal fee structure hinges on the magnitude of the post-trading costs. Noteworthy, a fee structure yielding higher social welfare may in fact reduce observed liquidity. Finally, we consider a number of extensions including market power for the CSD, anonymous trading and differences in broker size. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{material}} {{known as}} Hungarica Canadiana {{goes back to}} the 1880 s, when a group of Hungarians in Pennsylvania, U. S.

The first documents, mainly Cabinet discussions in Parliament, followed by extensive correspondence between the Canadian Government and Paul O. Eszterházy, a <b>settlement</b> <b>agent</b> in New York, are housed in the National Archives of Canada. During a century-and-a-half, the subject of Hungarian-Canadian studies and its archival collections has grown into an extensive and highly complex literature of print and non-print material, of official and semi-official documents issued by the Hungarian and Canadian governments and their related establishments, of societal and institutional records, of the cultural and religious organizations, as well as the private and family holdings of correspondence and photoalbums and handwritten manuscripts. Because of the enormity of the material, this essay is designed to focus on one aspect only: the archival records and their sources. As an ever growing interest has occurred over the years in Hungarian studies in Canada, the purpose of this survey is to make the vast amount of information on archival sources readily available to the student and the information specialist.

40|$|The thesis {{traces the}} {{interaction}} of the Goroka Valley people with European and coastal New Guinean intruders during the pacification stage of contact and change. In this 15 year period the people moved from a traditional subsistence culture to the threshold of a modern, European-influenced technological society. The contact experiences of the inhabitants of the Valley and the outsiders who influenced them are examined, using both oral and documentary sources. A central theme of this study is the attempts by Europeans and their coastal New Guinean collaborators to achieve the pacification of a people for whom warfare has been described as 2 ̆ 7 the dominant orientation 2 ̆ 7. The newcomers saw pacification as being inextricably linked with social, economic and religious transformation, and consequently it was pursued by patrol officers, missionaries and soldiers alike. Following an introductory chapter outlining the pre-contact and early-contact history of the Goroka Valley people, there is a discussion of the causes of tribal fighting in Highlands communities and two case studies of violent events which, although occurring beyond the Goroka Valley, had important consequences for those who lived within its bounds. The focus then shifts to the first permanent <b>settlement</b> of the <b>agents</b> of change -initially these were coastal New Guinean evangelists and policemen - and their impact on the local people. A period of consolidation is then described, as both government and missions established a permanent 2 ̆ 7 European presence in the Valley 2 ̆ 7. This period was characterised by vigorous pacification coupled with the introduction of innovations in health and education, agriculture, technology, law and religion. The gradual transformation of Goroka Valley society {{as a result of the}} people 2 ̆ 7 s interaction with the newcomers was abruptly accelerated in 1943, when many hundreds of Allied soldiers occupied the Valley in anticipation of a threatened Japanese invasion. Village life was disrupted as men were conscripted as carriers and labourers and whole communities were obliged to grow food to assist the Allied war effort. Those living close to military airfields-and camps were subject to Japanese aerial attacks and the entire population was exposed to an epidemic of bacillary dysentery introduced by the combatants. However the War also brought some positive effects, including paradoxically, the almost total cessation of tribal fighting, the construction of an ail-weather airstrip at Goroka which ensured its future as a town and administrative and commercial centre, and the compulsory growing of vegetables, coffee, etc, which laid the foundations for a cash economy and material prosperity. The final chapter examines the aftermath of military occupation, the return of civil administration and the implementation of social and economic policies which brought the Goroka Valley people into the rapid-development phase of contact. By 1949 Gorokans were ready to channel their aggressive energies into commercial competitiveness and adopt a cash-crop economy, to accept the European rule of law, to take advantage of Western innovations in medicine, education, transport and communications, to seek employment opportunities at home and in other parts of the country and to modify their primal world view with European religious and secular values.

40|$|Payment systems come in many forms, {{but their}} purpose {{is always the}} same - namely, to enable people to {{transfer}} funds from an account at one bank to an account at another bank. The alternative for the payer and the payee would be to settle their transaction either using cash or by barter. Banks themselves also use payment systems to transfer funds {{as a result of their}} own transactions (as distinct from their customers’). Whatever its particular form, a payment system can be seen as comprising three main elements or processes: A means of authorising and initiating the payment ie the means by which the payer gives authority to his bank for funds to be transferred. A means of transmitting and exchanging the payment instruction between the banks involved - usually referred to as clearing. A means of settlement between the banks involved - ie the payer’s bank has to compensate the payee’s bank, either bilaterally or through accounts that the banks hold at a third-party <b>settlement</b> <b>agent,</b> usually (but not always) the central bank. This Handbook considers these processes in more detail, and in particular the risks and policy issues that they present. A recurring theme is that, while there are a number of common risks and problems to be addressed, there is no single ideal way of addressing them. Solutions adopted in one country may not necessarily be appropriate in another. Another important message is that, in developing a new payment system or modifying an existing one, the emphasis must be on agreement and co-operation - both between central bank and commercial banks as the operators of the system, and between the system operators and its customers.

40|$|The Italian {{building}} heritage is composed mainly of masonry structures, which {{over the years}} have acquired historic significance and artistic values in the national culture. These buildings are particularly vulnerable to the seismic actions, because they were design for gravitational loads without considering seismic actions applied on them. Thus, the constructive details are not compliant with the present design code provisions (e. g. in plan or elevation structural regularity) and to avoid collapse or wide crack patterns, different strengthening interventions should be proposed or were done during the time (orthogonal wall connections, steel ties applications). In recent years, conservation and restoration of existing constructions assumed very important roles to reach an appropriate structural safety level, especially for artistic and monumental constructions, taking into account the benefit achieved by building restorations reducing the new constructions. The large number of destructive earthquakes occurred in Italy during the last century {{and the beginning of the}} new century has highlighted the need to redefine the design strategies and requirements especially in high seismic risk regions. Therefore, different seismic design provisions have occured during the time both in national and regional levels; the most recent is the Italian provisions (named, DM 2008 [1]). The fundamental innovative aspect of the aforementioned DM 2008 [1] is connected to the existing constructions and in particular it takes into account strategic buildings or structures playing very important rules for civil protection, introducing the research seismic engineering results into the professional world. The new seismic design provision introduced by the DM 2008 [1] give more emphasis on the management and maintenance of structures, which are often a relevant fraction of the total cost of the rehabilitation work. The new seismic design code have been inspired by the following general principals: 1) avoid structural damage and minimize non-structural damages for moderate intensity seismic events and seismic action characterized by return period comparable with the building operating life. Moreover non-structural damages for seismic events characterized by return period less than the building life should be avoided. These criteria respect the damage limit state condition (DLS); 2) The construction elements must have structural characteristics such as ductility to dissipate the energy released by earthquakes during high intensity seismic events without reaching collapse mechanisms; the safety of the people is, thus, ensured in case of events characterized by a lower probability of occurrence (return period of 475 years) which, to be endured without plastic deformation, would require an uneconomical design of the structure. A structural element damage are accepted in order to make the dissipative mechanisms possible. These criteria respect the ultimate limit state condition (ULS). As stated in the seismic design code, "…the purpose is to ensure the human life protection in case of earthquakes, the damages should be limited and the important structures in terms of civil protection should be working…”. Materials and strengthening techniques characterized by high performances and minimal impact on the structures play a crucial role on rehabilitation and restoration of existing buildings. The masonry structures, in a lot of cases having historic and architectural values, represent an important part of the Italian structural heritage. Many of the structural defects related to the masonry buildings are due to inadequate techniques and materials, earthquake and wind actions (horizontal loads), foundation <b>settlements,</b> atmospheric <b>agents</b> deterioration. In addition, higher loads acting on the structure due to different structural use and more stringent standards for seismic design provision lead to have need of appropriate strengthening interventions. The methods traditionally used for masonry structure rehabilitation are: - Fill cracks and voids with grout injections; - stitching large cracks or weak areas with metal parts or concrete elements; - reinforced perforations injected with mortar, in order to increase the masonry tensile strength; - jacketing on one or both masonry panel sides with reinforced concrete by using an electro welded steel grid. The use of fiber-reinforced composite materials represents an alternative to traditional intervention techniques: these materials, usually made of carbon fiber (CFRP), glass (GFRP) or aramid (AFRP) held together by a polymer matrix, provide unique combination of mechanical performances, including high strength and stiffness in fiber direction, corrosion resistance, light weight. They are available in form of sheets or rolls characterized by virtually unlimited length. All these properties allow to realize the structural seismic reinforcement without increasing the seismic mass. These types of composites are characterized by a high compatibility with the substrate in terms of geometric, chemical and mechanical properties. The research activities described in the following were partially carried out in Barcelona (Spain) and several ecclesiastic structures were selected in order to evaluate their seismic behavior applying European and Spanish design codes (EuroCode 8 [2] and NCSE- 02 [3], respectively). For that reason the earthquake phenomena effects were studied on three Spanish gothic structures by using limit analysis criteria in order to compute their seismic performances in terms of safety level, according to the Italian guide line for evaluation and reduction of the seismic risk of the cultural heritage (2006) [4]. The structures were separated into macro-elements subjected to in-plane and out-of-plane actions, applying the Capacity Spectrum Method (CSM) and the safety levels were computed by means of seismic demand and structural capacity ratio. Then, the attention was focused on in-plane structural behavior and, using available data from experimental tests on masonry panels carried out by other authors, a numerical simulations were implemented by using the finite element software DIANA TNO rel. 9. 2 [5]. Three experimental program on panels made by different materials were examined in order to be sure that the results obtained using numerical simulations were not strongly connected to the relative substrate. Thus, the analyzed models were made by hollow bricks, solid bricks and tuff bricks respectively and different mortars for each masonry panel were also used. Two aspects, considered of primary importance for masonry structures were analyzed: - the global performances by changing mechanical properties of structural elements; - the global performances reached by using FRP strengthening system. With reference to the first point, the masonry panel behaviour was analyzed by changing the compression (Gfc) and tensile fracture energy (Gft) for both bricks and mortar. The knowledge of the previous mentioned physical parameters is very complex to establish with traditional laboratory tests, but it is important to have a reliable masonry panel numerical simulation. In particular a specific range of feasible values of the fracture energy was considered, calculating them by using formulas introduced in the literature. Within that range the two extreme values and the average value or, in alternative, the value calculated according to the material mechanical strength were selected; then three different analyses were performed for each masonry panel. The second point has been performed by means of two different panel strengthening systems using Carbon Fiber reinforced (CFRP) : one by using diagonal stripes and the other composed by horizontal stripes (Grid layout). These numerical simulations, the global strengthened panel response was highlighted, changing several geometric characteristic of the strengthening system; width of the strip (for both diagonal and horizontal reinforcement) and the spacing between each strip (only for horizontal reinforcement) were modeled. The scope of the present research work was to compute the panel shear capacity and the initial stiffness of cracked panels subjected to in plane compression and shear loads by changing material mechanical properties, both for tuff and mortar, and considering different arrangement and amount of FRP reinforcement. Particular attention was also paid to the comparison between the “as built” panels and the strengthened ones by means of failure modes and crack patterns. Therefore, the present work was arranged in order to specify the structural typology where the introduced strengthening system could be applied, describing the different masonry structures and their main performances under seismic actions, such as shear capacity and failure mode. The work goes on describing the characterization of materials used in the simulation phase, the model by using DIANA software [5] considering both “as built” and strengthened masonry panels, the comparison between the numerical analyses results and experimental ones in order to validate the modelling and, at the end, to implement the parametric analysis by changing the geometrical and mechanical properties...|$|R
