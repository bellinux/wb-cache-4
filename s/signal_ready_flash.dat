50|$|The {{original}} probability learning {{experiment was}} developed by Lloyd Humphreys in 1939. In Humphreys' experiment, a <b>ready</b> <b>signal</b> was <b>flashed</b> and the participant was then told to predict {{whether or not a}} reinforcing event would happen and then the result was recorded. Humphreys claimed this experiment was synonymous to a conditioning experiment as he felt that the experiment allowed for reinforcement could be studied holding the result as reinforcement for the individuals predictions.|$|R

50|$|Introduced in 1992 the R7 offered {{complete}} flash automation. In program mode flash {{control was}} fully automatic, selected as necessary by the camera. In any mode <b>flash</b> <b>ready</b> would select <b>flash</b> synchronisation shutter speed.|$|R
50|$|It is {{believed}} that Sri Vadiraja Swami set up a window to commemorate this divine event. This window, with a trellis work of peep-holes is popularly known as Kanakana kindi (Kanaka's window). Peeping through this window, a pilgrim can have a <b>ready</b> <b>flashing</b> sight of Krishna's image without entering the temple. After this window was installed, it became customary for all devotees to catch a sight of Krishna's image through this window, before entering the temple.|$|R
50|$|WILK {{wanted to}} get a head start on the other local {{stations}} when it signed on in 1953, going on the air at 2 p.m. rather than the 3 pm sign on that the other stations did. The engineers got the <b>signal</b> <b>ready</b> by noon and decided to take a break. However, at lunch, they turned on the station to inspect their handiwork, only to find the signal was dead. They rushed back and were able to establish the link by 1:50 p.m., 10 minutes before sign-on.|$|R

40|$|A single scan TV-radiography system {{capable of}} {{providing}} analogue <b>signals</b> <b>ready</b> for A-D conversion for input to a computer has been investigated. Modulation transfer functions of both horizontal and vertical resolution have been obtained. The capability for gray scale reproduction was also investigated. The output data rate {{of the system is}} 16 KHz thereby providing compatibility to A-D converters generally available for most computers. In general, the capability of the system was found to exceed the input capabilities of available image-amplifiers and is therefore acceptable for quantitative fluoroscopic applications...|$|R

50|$|After all {{passengers}} {{have left}} or entered {{the train and}} the departure time has arrived, the conductor in chief asks the other conductor for his <b>ready</b> <b>signal.</b> If {{it is safe to}} depart he gives a <b>ready</b> <b>signal</b> to the conductor in chief who then gives the same signal to the train driver.|$|R
50|$|In late May 2009, in {{a filing}} with the FCC, Belo/Corridor {{stated that it}} would not have KCWX's digital <b>signal</b> <b>ready</b> to sign-on on June 12, instead expecting it to be ready on July 10 due to weather delays. Cable {{subscribers}} continued to view the station via a direct fiber connection of KCWX from KENS to the Time Warner Cable headend. Corridor/Belo was able to negotiate with the tower installer to finish the construction of the tower earlier than expected; KCWX's digital signal finally signed on the air on July 1, 2009. The signal reaches south of San Antonio and southeast to Nixon, north to Lampasas and west to Junction.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper aims {{to detect}} and {{characterize}} a signal coming from frequency modulation continuous wave radars. The radar signals are made of piecewise linear frequency modulations. The maximum chirplet transform (MCT), a simplification of the chirplet transform is proposed. A detection of the relevant maximum chirplets is proposed based on iterative masking, an iterative detection followed by window subtraction that {{does not require the}} recomputation of the spectrum. This detection is designed to provide a sparse subset of maximum chirplet coefficients. The chirplets are then gathered into linear chirps whose starting time, length, and chirprate are estimated. These chirps are then gathered again back into the different frequency modulation continuous wave <b>signals,</b> <b>ready</b> to be classified. An illustration is provided on synthetic data...|$|R
50|$|In Hungary a {{conductor}} may assist the train driver in testing the train's air brakes, {{and sometimes they}} have to lead the shunting, mostly when the trains are switching lines. Hungarian train conductors {{are responsible for the}} departure of the trains. In each station they give the permission to move on by giving a <b>ready</b> <b>signal</b> to the train driver. During the day they use a disc (which is white and has a green border) to give the <b>ready</b> <b>signal</b> to the train driver.|$|R
60|$|I placed my revolver, cocked, {{upon the}} top of the wooden case behind which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness--such an {{absolute}} darkness as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there, <b>ready</b> to <b>flash</b> out at a moment's notice. To me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the vault.|$|R

50|$|The Electron's {{cartridge}} ports were wired {{with the}} assumption that they'd be used only for ROMs, much as on the BBC Micro. The Master's slots replace the <b>READY</b> <b>signal</b> with an R/W signal so that RAM can also be plugged into the external cartridge ports.|$|R

50|$|Construction of {{the complex}} began in late 1942 with the Operations and <b>Signals</b> Bunker <b>ready</b> by early 1943. However, by November 1943 the bunker, {{identified}} as a semi-underground building because all cabling was laid underground, was not yet occupied because associated accommodation facilities had not been completed. The delay related {{to the fact that}} the complex was located some distance from the airfield and there was some question as to whether the facility could provide briefing to air crews in an adequate time frame. Eventually the site become operational in late 1944.|$|R

5000|$|Asynchronous {{pipelines}} {{are used}} in asynchronous circuits, and have their pipeline registers clocked asynchronously.
