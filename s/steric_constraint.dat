50|$|A {{chemical}} structure {{can be represented}} by a bond network of the kind familiar in molecular diagrams. The infinitely connected bond networks found in crystals can be simplified into finite networks by extracting one formula unit and reconnecting any broken bonds to each other. If the bond network is not known, a plausible network can be created by connecting well matched cations and anions that satisfy Eq. 4. If the finite network contains only cation-anion bonds, every bond can be treated as an electric capacitor (two equal and opposite charges linked by electrostatic flux). The bond network is thus equivalent to a capacitive electrical circuit with the charge on each capacitor being equivalent to the bond valence. The individual bond capacitors are not initially known, but {{in the absence of}} any information to the contrary we assume that they are all equal. In this case the circuit can be solved using the Kirchhoff equations, yielding the valences of each bond. Eq. 2 can then be used to calculate bond lengths which are found to lie within a few picometres of the observed bond lengths if no additional constraints are present. Additional constraints include electronic anisotropies (lone pairs and Jahn-Teller distortions) or steric constraints, (bonds stretched or compressed in order to fit them into three-dimensional space). Hydrogen bonds are an example of a <b>steric</b> <b>constraint.</b> The repulsion resulting from the close approach of the donor and acceptor atoms causes the bonds to be stretched, and under this constraint the distortion theorem predicts that the hydrogen atom will move off-center.|$|E

S-(p-Bromobenzyl) glutathione and the corresponding N alpha-, CGlu- and CGly-substituted derivatives have been found, at pH 6. 5, to be linear competitive inhibitors, with respect to GSH, of glutathione transferase.

Photoisomerization of the retinal chromophore from all-trans to 13 -cis initiates conformational changes in the protein, leading to activation of the cognate transducer protein (HtrII). We previously observed enhancement of the C 14 -D stretching vibration of the retinal chromophore at 2244 cm- 1 upon formation of the K state and interpreted that a <b>steric</b> <b>constraint</b> occurs at the C 14 D group in SRIIK. Here, we identify the counterpart of the C 14 D group as Thr 204, because the C 14 -D stretching signal disappeared in T 204 A, T 204 S, and T 204 C mutants {{as well as a}} C 14 -HOOP (hydrogen out-of-plane) vibration at 864 cm- 1. Although the K state of the wild-type bacteriorhodopsin (BR), a light-driven proton pump, possesses neither 2244 nor 864 cm- 1 bands, both signals appeared for the K state of a triple mutant of BR that functions as a light sensor (P 200 T/V 210 Y/A 215 T). We found a positive correlation between these vibrational amplitudes of the C 14 atom at 77 K and the physiological phototaxis response.

A good agreement between predicted and experimentally available adsorption enthalpies for C 1 -C 3 alcohols is obtained. The effect of the H-ZSM- 5 framework is sampled for adsorption of the C 1 -C 4 alcohols in the straight and the zigzag channel. A variety of possible geometries, including hydrogen-bonded (physisorbed) and protonated (chemisorbed) complexes, are located as stable minima indicating that the potential energy surface connecting them is broad and very shallow. Experimental infrared (IR) spectra of the C 1 -C 4 alcohols are interpreted based on harmonic frequency calculations for the most stable physisorbed and chemisorbed complexes. The stability of the adsorbed alcohols is governed by an interplay between their intrinsic basicity, van der Waals dispersive interactions and <b>steric</b> <b>constraints</b> exerted by the zeolite framework. In essence, <b>steric</b> <b>constraints</b> destabilize local hydrogen bonding and/or Coulomb alcohol-Bronsted acid site interactions while dispersive van der Waals interactions enhance the stability of physisorbed and chemisorbed complexes.

The analysis of the extended x-ray absorption fine structure and of the near edge regions of the x-ray absorption spectra at the Zn K-edge provided an accurate description of the local structure showing that the Zn ions are bound to the heads of the phospholipid molecules.

Although aldolase has three twofold axes, filaments in actin-aldolase rafts were not strictly related by a twofold axis. Interfilament angles were on average + 15 Â° off the expected 180 Â°, and most rafts appeared handed; that is, rows of cross-bridges were tilted in a clockwise direction off the perpendicular. We can account for both the deviation of the angle from 180 Â° and the handedness of the rafts by a <b>steric</b> <b>constraint</b> due to the lipid layer. We further found that the axial spacings of cross-bridges varied significantly from raft to raft. We suggest that this difference arises from variations in the twist of the filaments that nucleate raft formation; that is, filaments added to a raft adopt the symmetry {{of those in the}} raft. We conclude that the organization of filaments in rafts can be modulated by outside factors such as the lipid layer and that the variable twist of filaments in the nucleating core of the raft are imposed on all the filaments in the raft.

40|$|Diffusion can be conceptualized, at {{microscopic}} scales, as {{the random}} hopping of particles between neighboring lattice sites. In {{the case of}} diffusion in inhomogeneous media, distinct spatial domains in the system may yield distinct particle hopping rates. Starting from the master equations (MEs) governing diffusion in inhomogeneous media we derive here, for arbitrary spatial dimensions, the deterministic lattice equations (DLEs) specifying the average particle number at each lattice site for randomly diffusing particles in inhomogeneous media. We {{consider the case of}} free diffusion with no <b>steric</b> <b>constraints</b> on the maximum particle number per lattice site as well as the case of diffusion under <b>steric</b> <b>constraints</b> imposing a maximum particle concentration. We find, for both transient and asymptotic regimes, excellent agreement between the DLEs and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of the MEs. The DLEs provide a computationally efficient method for predicting the (average) distribution of randomly diffusing particles in inhomogeneous media, with the number of DLEs associated with a given system being independent of the number of particles in the system. From the DLEs we obtain general analytic expressions for the steady-state particle distributions for free diffusion and, in special cases, diffusion under <b>steric</b> <b>constraints</b> in inhomogeneous media. We find that, in the steady state of the system, the average fraction of particles in a given domain is independent of most system properties, such as the arrangement and shape of domains, and only depends on the number of lattice sites in each domain, the hopping rates, the number of distinct particle species, and the total number of particles of each particle species in the system.

Five alpha-amino acids, beta-alanine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid were used to investigate the metal ion and amino acid specificity in binding. It was assumed that the alpha, beta, and gamma-amino acids would bind as bidentate anionic ligands, forming either 1 : 1 or 1 : 2 six-coordinated five, six, and seven-membered-ring chelate complexes, respectively.

Whereas biologists have proposed models where the shape is controlled on a molecular level [1], physicists, following Turing [2] and dâArcy Thomson [3], have developed theories where patterns arise spontaneously [4]. Here, we propose that volume constraints restrict the possible shapes of leaves. Focusing on palmate leaves (with lobes), the central observation is that developing leaves first grow folded inside a bud, limited by the previous and subsequent leaves. We show that the lobe perimeters end at the border of this small volume. This induces a direct relationship between the way it was folded and the final unfolded shape of the leaf. These dependencies can be approximated as simple geometrical relationships that we confirm on both folded embryonic and unfolded mature leaves. We find that independent of their position in the phylogenetic tree, these relationships work for folded species, but do not work for non-folded species. This global regulation for the leaf growth could come from a mechanical <b>steric</b> <b>constraint.</b> Such steric regulation should be more general and considered as a new simple means of global regulation...|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} the {{mechanism}} for molecular recognition requires one of the interacting proteins, usually the smaller of the two, to anchor a specific side chain in a structurally constrained binding groove of the other protein, providing a <b>steric</b> <b>constraint</b> that helps to stabilize a native-like bound intermediate. We identify the anchor residues in 39 proteinâprotein complexes and verify that, {{even in the absence}} of their interacting partners, the anchor side chains are found in conformations similar to those observed in the bound complex. These ready-made recognition motifs correspond to surface side chains that bury the largest solvent-accessible surface area after forming the complex (â¥ 100 Ã 2). The existence of such anchors implies that binding pathways can avoid kinetically costly structural rearrangements at the core of the binding interface, allowing for a relatively smooth recognition process. Once anchors are docked, an induced fit process further contributes to forming the final high-affinity complex. This later stage involves flexible (solvent-exposed) side chains that latch to the encounter complex in the periphery of the binding pocket. Our results suggest that the evolutionary conservation of anchor side chains applies to the actual structure that these residues assume before the encounter complex and not just to their loci. Implications for protein docking are also discussed...|$|E

Despite the similarity between PAA and DAA, it is surprising that the lowest energy structure of PAA is predicted to have (H(2) O center dot center dot center dot H center dot center dot center dot OH(2)) (+) Zundel-like symmetric hydrogen bonding, whereas that of DAA has H(3) O(+) Eigen-like asymmetric hydrogen bonding. The energy profiles show that direct proton transfer between mirror image structures is unfavorable. Instead, the chiral transformation is possible by subsequent backbone twistings through stepwise proton transfer along multistep intermediate structures, which are Zundel-like ions for PAA and Eigen-like ions for DAA. This type of chiral transformation by multistep intramolecular proton transfers is unprecedented. Several prominent OH center dot center dot center dot O short hydrogen-bond stretching peaks are predicted in the range of 1000 - 1700 cm(- 1) in the Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics (CPMD) simulations, which show distinctive signatures different from ordinary hydrogen-bond peaks.
