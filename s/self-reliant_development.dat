50|$|In 1903 to 1912, {{the whole}} area South of Numan Town was {{regarded}} as “closed territory”. It was not until after 1912 that Bali land, including those living in Mayo-Belwa and Lau was opened to Christian missionaries.By the 1940s, colonialism and Christianity were deeply noted in Bali villages. Indeed, while the Christian missions, especially the United Sudan Mission (SUM) were busy softening {{the minds of the}} people they saw as “uncivilized”, the British Colonial Masters were taking their resources away for the development of their home countries. The result is that Bali was left to face acute starvation and hunger. In this1 way, colonialism continued to destroy Bali economy, technology and <b>self-reliant</b> <b>development</b> just as the slave raiders and Jihadists had done.This was how the whole of Baliland became a British possession {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century like any other ethnic nationality in Nigeria. Indeed, slave trade and colonialism were the major forces that set back Bali development. The slave raiders dominated Bali homeland and the British exploited Bali homeland and the British exploited Bali resources. Throughout colonial period, the Bali struggled to free themselves from colonial domination. In 1913, for example, one of the Bali men short and wounded a British Touring Officer who had gone to Bali for head account. In reprisal, Bali village was attacked and destroyed by the British punitive expedition. It took the people years to build their village. But this did not stop the people from opposing the British actively or passively. On 1 October 1960, however, the Bali people together with the rest of the ethnic groups in the country gained political independence from Britain.|$|E

The timeframe spans the 1994 transformation date {{to the middle of}} June 1999. The article looks at the marginalised and disadvantaged position – which appears to be in a peripheral state – of existence of the above churches. Attention is first focused on the extent of the problem from which the specific objective is derived: the setting of guidelines by which these churches can develop towards self-reliance. Since the subject is closely related to the discipline of theology and the subdivision, ecclesiology, this article also involves this discipline. The guidelines for <b>self-reliant</b> <b>development</b> vary between orthodox reformed principles and radical unorthodox guidelines, in line with the challenges facing these churches and their available resources.

30|$|Under China’s {{transition}} to state-managed capitalism {{from the late}} 1970 s onwards, intimate relationships and family life have been shaped by two central developmental tendencies. First, the past 35  years have witnessed a partial retreat of the state from the private sphere (Davis 2014). Certain forms of intervention into family life, for instance through welfare provision and collective forms of community and labour organisation, have ceased, opening up new spaces for <b>self-reliant</b> personal <b>development</b> (Ikels 2006; Yan 2009). The Second Marriage Law of 1980 and the Revised Marriage Law of 2001 offered {{a new understanding of}} marriage as a private contract, as well as a move away from state surveillance of intimate relationships, thus contributing significantly to the privatisation of intimate relationships (Palmer 2007; Davis 2014). The academic literature associates these developments with possibilities for sexual experimentation especially among younger generations (Pan 1994; Pan 2002; Farrer 2004; Pan and Yang 2004) and the growing sociocultural significance of romantic love and companionate couple relationships (Wang and Nehring 2014; Jeffreys and Yu 2015).|$|R

40|$|Issues of <b>self-reliant</b> <b>development</b> or {{ownership}} {{have been}} discussed ever since developing countries gained their political independence. The issues have been particularly keen in small, isolated island economies where resource bases are extremely limited.

The paper attempts to provide an answer to small islands' seemingly eternal questions: how can we achieve economic self-reliance? Or more specifically, how we can achieve sustainable development without relying heavily on external aid? Every onscientious planner now recognizes that the past process of economic development through deepening dependency on external aid is not only unsustainable in the long run, but also the process is inconsistent with the strategy of self-reliance.

40|$|For any {{development}} facilitator {{or change}} agent, a potential paradox can arise when, assisting with <b>self-reliant</b> participatory <b>development.</b> This paradox {{occurs when the}} change agent tries to help and encourage people to develop themselves and, in so doing, undermines their self-reliance and sustainability, the very aim of development. The theoretical basis for the meaning of development is often {{at the root of}} such a paradox: it is argued that theory and the concept of development are in actual fact incompatible within the realm of social reality. It is further argued that Participatory Learning and Action (PLA), which rejects theory as the foundation for development and embraces human consciousness, can offer an appropriate strategy that can avoid such a paradox. This article is inspired by the tenacious efforts of resource-poor people.

The URDR’s mission is to empower faithbased communities towards achieving <b>self-reliant</b> sustainable <b>development</b> and outcomes through research, theorizing and training. As the name indicates, the agenda for our research activities is both religion and development, especially the nexus between the two concepts. There is a distinct connection between development and social transformation (see Castles, 1999 : 2 ff.) and hence a relation between religion and social transformation, the topic of this paper.

40|$|The European Union's LEADER Initiative {{represents}} {{an attempt to}} generate rural development at the 'grass-roots' level.

More specifically, it is shown that the characteristics of the two selected rural areas of Andalusia significantly influenced the nature of the local programmes proposed, with - in one case - a failure to comprehend the essential nature of the scheme. However, in neither case can it be argued that a truly 'grass-roots' level of development has been stimulated as there is little evidence of significant change in the process of social mobilisation with the objective of promoting <b>self-reliant</b> <b>development.</b> Instead, the Initiative has led to considerable emphasis being placed on the development of tangible products and projects...|$|E
40|$|Few {{health or}} {{development}} programs {{take into account}} the way in which real life communities structure and value their own time. Many programs are 'time stealing', and when communities find time inputs are too expensive, many adverse effects on community health and development appear. Even the spare time produced by leisure and seasonality may be mitigated by time costs related to sickness, and taking long journeys needed to reach areas of services like clinics, markets, churches, weddings [...] One effective way of introducing time, in health and social development, is to prepare a community time budget or more precisely a balance sheet of community activities, where alternative uses and effective allocations of time become a primary concern of community planning. This paper, by applying a time budget analysis with examples from Ethiopia, aims to demonstrate what the problem is and how it might be solved. One of the major bases of the social goal of 'health for all by the year 2000 ' is community enthusiasm and participation in Primary Health Programs. This paper aims to show that the way to achieve <b>self-reliant</b> <b>development,</b> appropriate to local conditions and aspirations, is by employing time budget analysis for activity planning in rural areas. ...|$|E
40|$|The Indian {{pharmaceutical}} industry represents a successful case of indigenous <b>self-reliant</b> <b>development.</b> Over {{the last three}} decades the Indian industry, working under weak patent laws, used reverse engineering skills to develop capabilities in process R&D and generics drug development. With the signing of the TRIPS agreement Indian firms faced a stronger regulatory environment which restricted the application of imitative R&D. This change in regulation accelerated development of innovative R&D capabilities in the Indian pharmaceutical firms. Building on process R&D capabilities Indian firms entered the generics market in advanced regions such as Europe and US. Indian firms started their subsidiaries in Europe and US and acquired firms in these countries. From 1995 Indian pharma firms began investing in the development of capabilities in new drug development and new drug delivery systems R&D. Major Indian firms have filed patents for new chemical entities and signed licensing deals with large MNC pharmaceutical firms. Indian firms hired Indian scientists educated or working overseas in multinational pharmaceutical R&D to acquire capabilities in innovative R&D. These scientists {{played a key role in}} development of R&D capabilities in Indian firms by bridging knowledge gaps in pharmaceutical R&D. However transfer of knowledge by hiring scientists is a complex process.

Indian firms have responded to these issues by adopting global R&D management practices...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the obstacles that communities have to confront, and the solutions {{they have made}} use of to organise and sustain community participation for service provision. Orthodox participatory theory assumes that communities have the knowledge and the appropriate attitudes to manage participatory projects effectively. This thesis questions these assumptions by using Transaction Cost Theory to understand the failures and successes of Community Participatory Development (CPD). Participant observation in three traditional rural Mexican communities demonstrated that the assumptions of <b>self-reliant</b> participatory <b>development</b> theory overlook important problems, such as unequally distributed and limited information, limited resources and skills, opportunistic attitudes and conflicts of interest. These problems generate cooperation costs in terms of time, effort and other material and intangible resources. We argue that the larger these costs, the less {{likely it is that}} community participation will succeed unless effective incentives are created to overcome them. This is so, because rural people intend to be rational and self-interested individuals, who will only involve themselves in collective action if they expect the benefits to exceed the costs. However, we argue, that rationality is institutionally bounded, and that local institutions {{play a central role in}} determining choices and behaviour. Therefore, successful community participation is directly related to communities' capacity to use institutional arrangements to deal with the costs of cooperation and specially to reconcile private and collective interests. This thesis shows that institutional arrangements that sanction opportunism, and shape individual behaviour in favour of the collective interest are needed for collective action to arise. These institutional solutions involve sanctions and hierarchies to ensure successful projects, problems ignored by populist participatory theories. By so doing, this thesis builds an alternative and more critical model for the analysis of participation theory, and presents a new perspective on the possibilities and limitations of Transaction Costs Economics...|$|R
40|$|The last {{forty years}} have {{witnessed}} {{a proliferation of}} very small states, or micro-states with populations of approximately one million or less. Most of these states are developing economies {{but in recent years}} even the smallest European micro-states have won acceptance in the councils of the organised international system. This study is a comprehensive examination of the international relations of these states in three principal areas of concern: issues of status and legitimacy; the conduct of diplomacy and the efforts of micro-states to achieve strategies of <b>self-reliant</b> economic <b>development.</b> While the research has confirmed the vulnerabilities of micro-states in all three areas which have been stressed in the literature of the last decade, it also reveals surprising opportunities for some micro-states to ameliorate their weaknesses and to achieve a constructive engagements within the international system. The international milieu and the many support systems at both the regional and global level have actually reinforced the sovereignty of micro-states while providing them with added resources to exploit the opportunities which an increasingly integrated global economy offers. Unlike earlier studies in the field, this dissertation treats the experience of micro-states within the broad context of post- 1945 history and thus provides an overall perspective for assessing the impact of very small size over 50 years. It also represents a departure from the existing literature in its determination to include both the developed micro-states in Europe and the more commonly studied micro-states in the developing world. Finally, much of the analysis compares the experiences of micro-states with those of forty larger small states in the next population class, an approach which has not been undertaken elsewhere. The impact of this comparison further confirms the general findings of the dissertation that the international system of the mid to late 1990 s has evolved into a largely supportive milieu for micro-states in spite of the serious and occasionally dangerous problems which they continue to face...|$|R
40|$|The {{existing}} {{social and}} institutional structures {{at the village}} level are so occupied with immediate issues of survival {{that they have been}} unable to divert much of their energy to long term development goals. The situation is characterized by the existence of "social traps" which lead people to adopt short term solutions and ignore the long term consequences of their actions. At such low income levels future expected returns are also likely to be discounted at very high rates. It {{is a reflection of the}} state of affairs that very little new land was brought under cultivation since independence. Individually, the farmers lacked the resources which could enable them to develop new land. The opening of the Karakorum highway has created new economic opportunities. Technical inputs such as chemical fertilizer, improved seed varieties and other mechanical technologies are now available. However, to fully exploit these new opportunities, there is a need for additional inputs such as: new institutional arrangements, productive physical infrastructure at the village level, credit, reliable transport facilities and investment in human capital. This process required long term planning, large capital outlays and the need to work with the government. One program which is helping in this development is the Aga Khan Rural Support Programme (AKRSP). AKRSP identified the problem as one which needed a restructuring of economic incentives, increasing village productivity, providing crucial inputs and creating a village cooperative. Its underlying premise is that the creation of a broad-based, <b>self-reliant</b> and <b>development</b> oriented institution at the village level can help address the complex issues of development in the area. The objectives of this study are classified as the following: (1) to examine how the village organizations established by AKRSP work in practice; (2) identify functions which the village organization can undertake successfully; (3) identify factors which will contribute to the increased effectiveness of these structures and (4) assess the sustainability of these cooperatives at the local and regional levels.
