40|$|A {{prescribed}} wake model named HAWTDAWG {{is used in}} this study. It is a {{lifting line}} model in which the blades are replaced by a line of bound vorticity, and the wake is modelled by a lattice of vortex filaments, whose strengths are based on blade sectional aerodynamic coefficients, usually taken from 2 D wind tunnel experiments. Five different <b>stall</b> <b>delay</b> models are incorporated in this model, namely those of Bak et al., Snel et al., Corrigan and Schillings, Du and Selig, and Chaviaropoulos and Hansen. To our knowledge, {{a study of the}} proposed <b>stall</b> <b>delay</b> models has never been made with a lifting line, prescribed wake model. In contrast to a code based on the blade element momentum method, the present vortex wake scheme models the wake behind the rotor and its induced effect, providing more detailed information that can shed light on the <b>stall</b> <b>delay</b> phenomenon. Results show that the use of corrected aerodynamic data from the different <b>stall</b> <b>delay</b> models generally leads to an overprediction of the thrust and power for wind speeds above 10 m/s, and of the loads, mostly near the root. The tangential force coefficient for wind velocities above 10 m/s is especially overpredicted over more than half the blade, while it was quite accurately predicted using 2 D airfoil data.

For the CER, predictions were made with a constant-chord/twisted blade and a hypothetical tapered/twisted blade. Results for the constant-chord/twisted blade were compared with CER data.

The predicted peak power increase due to <b>stall</b> <b>delay</b> for the CER was found to be quite large (20 % to 30 %) as a result of its high blade solidity.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Large wind turbine blades, manufactured from fibre reinforced laminated composite materials, are key structural components of wind turbine systems. The demands for efficient and accurate modelling techniques of these composite blades have significantly increased. Over past decades, although complex computational models have been widely developed, more analytically based models are still very much desired to drive the design and optimization of these composite blades forward to be lighter, stronger, efficient and durable. The research work in this thesis aims to develop such more analytically based aerodynamic, structural and aero-elasticity models for large wind turbine blades manufactured from fibre reinforced laminated composite materials. Firstly, an improved blade element momentum (BEM) model has been developed by collectively integrating the individual corrections with the classic BEM model. Compared to other existing models, present BEM model accounts for blade tip and root losses more accurately. For laminar flow, the 3 -D cross-flow is negligibly small. In this case, present BEM model with statically measured 2 -D aerodynamic coefficients agrees closely to experimental measurements. However, <b>stall</b> <b>delay</b> correction is required for a 3 -D rotating blade in stall. A new <b>stall</b> <b>delay</b> model is developed based on Snel s <b>stall</b> <b>delay</b> model. Verifications are performed and discussed for the extensively studied NREL UAE phase-VI test. The predictions of distributive and collective factors, e. g. normalised force coefficients, shaft torque and etc. have been compared to experimental measurements. The present BEM model and <b>stall</b> <b>delay</b> model are original and more accurate than existing models. Secondly, significant deficiency is discovered in the analytical thin-walled closed-section composite beam (TWCSCB) model proposed by Librescu and Vo, which is widely used by others for structural modelling of wind turbine blades. To correct such deficiency, an improved TWCSCB model is developed in a novel manner that is applicable to both single-cell and multi-cell closed sections made of arbitrary composite laminates. The present TWCSCB model has been validated {{for a variety of}} geometries and arbitrary laminate layups. The numerical verifications are also performed on a realistic wind turbine blade (NPS- 100) for structural analysis. Consistently accurate correlations are found between present TWCSCB model and the ABAQUS finite element (FE) shell model. Finally, the static aero-elasticity model is developed by combining the developed BEM model and TWCSCB model. The interactions are accounted through an iterative process. The numerical applications are carried out on NPS- 100 wind turbine. The numerical results show some significant corrections by modelling wind turbine blades with elastic coupling...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. With the {{variation}} of the unsteady incoming flow and impeller rotation, when attack angles of the incoming flow is bigger than the critical angle of attack, there are unsteady separation and dynamic stall on the pressure surface of the impeller. Dynamic stalls are of common occurrence during wind turbines ’ operation. And the aerodynamic characteristics and efficiency of wind turbine are largely affected by the dynamic stall. Therefore,the study of dynamic stall has a great significance over the optimization design of the wind turbine. The paper performs numerical simulation in the dynamic stalls of the 1. 2 MW horizontal-axis wind turbine, comparing the stalling difference between two-dimensional static and rotating condition. Besides, it also contrasts the stalling condition surface pressure coefficient along the different blade spanwise sections in rotating condition of the same attack angle. And the finding is that the attack angles in rotating condition is bigger than that in the two-dimensional static condition; the surface pressure coefficient is almost equivalent in static and rotating condition when attack angle is smaller than stalling angle; the peak of negative pressure {{at the leading edge}} of blade in rotating condition is far bigger than the peak of negative pressure in static condition when attack angle is smaller than static stalling angle.

40|$|Understanding of the <b>stall</b> <b>delay</b> {{phenomenon}} on {{wind turbines}} remains, to this day, incomplete. A correct modelling of this phenomenon, which results from three-dimensional rotational effects, {{is essential in}} order to make reliable wind turbine simulations on the basis of two-dimensional airfoil data, such as with the widely used blade element momentum method. The present study addresses this issue by testing six existing models intended to correct for <b>stall</b> <b>delay</b> effects, namely those developed by Snel et al., Chaviaropoulos and Hansen, Raj, Bak et al, Corrigan and Schillings and Lindenburg. For this purpose, the models are implemented into a lifting-line-prescribed wake vortex scheme. Forces along the blades as well as power and root flop bending moment in a head-on flow configuration are predicted based on these models, and are compared to wind tunnel data from NREL's phase V 1 experiment. While load over-prediction in the presence of stall is in general observed from the use of the different models, significant differences between the models ore still seen. Local over-prediction is generally seen in the tip region, while discrepancies are obtained, even at low wind speed, for the root flap bending moment. The results obtained are discussed in terms of deficiencies and strengths of the current correction schemes, and from there a basis is provided for the development of improved correction models...|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates a new {{approach}} to model the stochastic variations in the aerodynamic loads on yawed wind turbines experienced at high angles of attack. The method applies the one-dimensional Langevin equation in conjunction with known mean and standard deviation values for the lift and drag data. The method is validated using the experimental data from the NREL Phase VI rotor in which the mean and standard deviation values for the lift and drag are derived through the combined use of blade pressure measurements and a free-wake vortex model. Given that direct blade pressure measurements are used, 3 D flow effects arising from the co-existence of dynamic stall and <b>stall</b> <b>delay</b> are taken into account. The model is an important step towards verification of several assumptions characterized as the estimated standard deviation, Gaussian white noise of the data and the estimated drift and diffusion coefficients of the Langevin equation. The results using the proposed assumptions lead to a good agreement with measurements over a wide range of operating conditions. This provides motivation to implement a general fully independent theoretical stochastic model within a rotor aerodynamics model, such as the free-wake vortex or blade-element momentum code, whereby the mean lift and drag coefficients can be estimated using 2 D aerofoil data with correction models for 3 D dynamic stall and <b>stall</b> <b>delay</b> phenomena, while the corresponding standard derivations are estimated through CFD. peer-reviewe...|$|E

40|$|After {{introducing}} {{the main features}} of the aerodynamics of wind turbines, a review of key theoretical studies and aerodynamic modelling methods provides the opportunity to focus on predictive methods and the main technical challenges associated with the aerodynamics of HAWTs. The basic aerodynamic method adopted in this study, a classic Blade Element Momentum theory model, BEM, is described next and its extension to yawed flow is detailed for completeness. Analysis then focuses on how <b>stall</b> <b>delay</b> due to three-dimensional effects can be predicted on a HAWT. Implementation of a semi-empirical <b>stall</b> <b>delay</b> model shows sensitivity to blade geometry but no dependency on wind velocity or rotational speed. This seems to be physically incorrect and suggests that {{a deeper understanding of}} 3 -D effects is still needed if better algorithms are to be developed. The work then examines the onset of dynamic stall. A 2 -D semi-empirical correlation of vortex stall onset, developed previously at Glasgow University, is implemented and validated through available field data from the NREL turbine Phases II and IV. The comparison of measured and predicted locations of dynamic stall onset highlights some interesting features of the three-dimensionality of the process; after the local inception, earlier dynamic stall appears to be triggered in adjacent stations. An attempt to study how 3 -D <b>stall</b> <b>delay</b> interacts with the onset of dynamic stall, shows that <b>stall</b> <b>delay</b> appears not to influence the inception of dynamic stall in the way it does static stall. Moreover, the firsts signs of dynamic stall onset are generally best characterised by the correlation when it assumes locally 2 -D flow. This is a significant result, as it demonstrates that the earliest signs of dynamic stall onset on wind turbines can be correctly predicted using 2 -D tools. A closer examination of the discrepancies between the predictions and measurements has highlighted the particular aerodynamic characteristics of the S 809 aerofoil, utilised as the blade section of the NREL turbines. The unusual stalling characteristics of this aerofoil bring into question the significance of the static stall angle in relation to dynamic stall. It is show that other features of the static behaviour may provide a more appropriate link to dynamic stall for some aerofoils. Finally, the phenomenon of tower shadow on a downwind turbine is studied. Unaveraged pressure measurements and integrated normal force coefficients from tests conducted at Glasgow University are analysed. The analysis highlights many interesting features of the tower shadow response. In particular, as the blade enters the tower shadow region, there is a rapid reduction in normal force due to the tower wake velocity deficit. As the blade leaves the tower shadow, the recovery is consistently slower and more progressive and apparently extends further than the edge of the velocity deficit region. These observations are then used in a examination of tower shadow modelling. A steady model, based on a cosine shaped velocity deficit is evaluated by comparison with the wind tunnel measurements. Unfortunately neither the phase nor the intensity of the response is adequately captured. This leads to the implementation of a new model, based on classic unsteady thin aerofoil theory that accounts for the aerofoil wake induced velocities. The unsteady model captures, in a satisfactory manner, the global response of the blade through the tower shadow region, with a negligible computational cost...|$|E

The kinematic parameters include plunging amplitude, angular amplitude, and pitching/plunging phase angle. Composite surrogate models are constructed and global sensitivity evaluations of these variables are analyzed. Wake capture, <b>delayed</b> <b>stall,</b> and interaction with a jet-like flow feature all influence the performance of the airfoil. It is found that the plunging amplitude and reduced frequency play a surprisingly small role in determining the airfoil performance in the design space examined.
