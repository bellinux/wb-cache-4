Corrosion of hull plates may decrease the strength and life of the ship, thus reducing the safety program can reduce the load cargo and passenger ships.

In this work, the simulated seawater, sea mud and seawater/sea mud transition region systems were set up in laboratory, it can measure the galvanic corrosion of <b>sacrificial</b> <b>anode</b> in seawater/sea mud transition environment. Results show that the corrosion rate of Al-Zn-In-Mg-Ti <b>sacrificial</b> <b>anode</b> in simulated seawater is higher than that in simulated sea mud.

50|$|Cathodic {{protection}} {{is a technique}} used to inhibit corrosion on buried or immersed structures by supplying an electrical charge that suppresses the electrochemical reaction.

The <b>sacrificial</b> <b>anode</b> must be made from something with a more negative electrode potential than the iron or steel, commonly zinc, aluminium, or magnesium.

25|$|On 9 September 2007, Australian and Turkish naval {{authorities}} {{began an}} undersea investigation {{to determine if}} AE2 could be raised and restored. Such a plan would see the submarine transferred to a viewing tank at Çanakkale. As part of the inspection, a drop camera was inserted through the submarine's open hatch and into the control room. The survey team discovered that the wreck of AE2 had suffered further damage since the 1998 inspection dives. The bow portion of the external hull casing had been destroyed and {{the rear of the}} conning tower now showed significant damage. Following an April 2008 workshop by the Turkish Institute of Nautical Archaeology and the Submarine Institute of Australia, the recommendation was made against raising the wreck. Moving the submarine to a viewing tank, or alternately relocating the wreck to shallower water, were advised against because of the AU$80–100 million cost of such projects. Moving AE2 would also pose high risk to both the submarine and any vessels involved in the relocation; as well as potentially damaging the wreck, there is still an unexploded torpedo aboard. Instead, the workshop advised that the submarine be preserved through the use of <b>sacrificial</b> <b>anodes</b> to reduce corrosion, along with buoys and a surveillance system to mark the wreck and detect unauthorised access and potential damage.|$|E

The <b>sacrificial</b> <b>anode</b> technologies currently available are generally less powerful than impressed current cathodic protection but they are much less complex to apply. The technology requires no installed power supply and the installation of electrical cables is mainly limited to non-critical monitoring. Uncontrolled anode-steel shorts present no problems to system function and stray current corrosion of discontinuous steel is limited. In many cases the technology can be targeted to areas of need. In general, the output of a <b>sacrificial</b> <b>anode</b> system cannot be adjusted to manage a corrosion risk.

40|$|Corrosion {{of steel}} {{reinforcement}} in concrete bridges and parking garages {{due to the}} intrusion of chloride ions from deicing salt {{is a serious problem}} in northern climates. A number of approaches have been used in the past to mitigate steel corrosion. Cathodic protection is considered to be the only technique to slow down corrosion in salt contaminated concrete to a negligible rate. This is accomplished by either an impressed current <b>anode</b> or a <b>sacrificial</b> <b>anode</b> in the system. The impressed current anode system, with metallized zinc as the anode material, has been used with success on a number of bridges. The <b>sacrificial</b> <b>anode</b> system has been used on a limited number of bridges under marine environment. An impressed current system is difficult to apply to parking garages because of the thickness of concrete cover in these structures. Cover in concrete parking garages is typically much thinner than that used in bridges, and may easily cause electrical shorts between the anode and the reinforcing bar. Systems with sacrifical anodes, commonly referred to as galvanic cathodic protection systems, instead, take advantage of the reduced thickness of concrete cover, thus becoming a feasible form of protection for parking structures. The goal of this research project is to develop a <b>sacrificial</b> <b>anode</b> for cathodic protection of steel reinforcement in parking garages and bridges. Although {{it is too early to}} draw conclusions, certain trends have been reported on performance of <b>sacrificial</b> <b>anode</b> systems.
