Some Dodger players insinuated they would sit out rather than play alongside Robinson. The brewing mutiny ended when Dodgers management took a stand for Robinson.

[...] Churchill wrote an anti-Jellicoe tract in his World Crisis, Volume III which in large measure shared Dewar's views on tactics and even some diagrams.

2500|$|On November 20, 1955, African-American rock 'n' roll {{singer and}} guitarist Bo Diddley {{appeared}} on The Ed Sullivan Show, only to infuriate Sullivan ("I did two songs {{and he got}} mad"). Diddley {{had been asked to}} sing Tennessee Ernie Ford's hit [...] "Sixteen Tons", which he agreed. But when he appeared on stage, he forgot his cue and instead sang his #1 R hit song that bears his name. Diddley later recalls, [...] "Ed Sullivan says to me in plain words: 'You are the first black boy—quote—that ever double crossed me!' I was ready to fight, because I was a little young dude off the streets of Chicago, an' him callin' me 'black' in them days was as bad as sayin' 'nigger'. My manager says to me 'That's Mr. Sullivan!'

2500|$|Roger Hahn {{disputes}} this {{portrayal of}} Laplace as an opportunist and turncoat, pointing out that, like many in France, he {{had followed the}} debacle of Napoleon's Russian campaign with serious misgivings. The Laplaces, whose only daughter Sophie had died in childbirth in September 1813, were in fear {{for the safety of}} their son Émile, who was on the eastern front with the emperor. Napoleon had originally come to power promising stability, but {{it was clear that he}} had overextended himself, putting the nation at peril. It was at this point that Laplace's loyalty began to weaken. Although he still had easy access to Napoleon, his personal relations with the emperor cooled considerably. As a grieving father, he was particularly cut to the quick by Napoleon's insensitivity in an exchange related by Jean-Antoine Chaptal: [...] "On his return from the rout in Leipzig, he [...] accosted Mr Laplace: 'Oh! I <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have grown thin—Sire, I have lost my daughter—Oh! that's not a reason for losing weight. You are a mathematician; put this event in an equation, and you will find that it adds up to zero.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Around 222, {{at the age}} of 24, Sun Huan was {{commissioned}} as General of the Household Who Pacifies the East (安東中郎將) and ordered to join Sun Quan's general Lu Xun at the Battle of Xiaoting against Liu Bei, who launched a campaign against Sun Quan to retake Jing Province. During the preliminary stages of the battle, Sun Huan led a separate force to attack Liu Bei's vanguard force at Yidao (夷道) but ended up being besieged by the enemy. He requested for reinforcements from Lu Xun but was denied. When the other officers urged Lu Xun to help Sun Huan, Lu declined, saying that Sun Huan was capable of holding his ground and that the siege would automatically be lifted later. Sun Quan's forces eventually inflicted a devastating defeat on Liu Bei's forces at the Battle of Xiaoting. As Lu Xun predicted, the siege on Yidao was lifted, after which Sun Huan led troops to block Liu Bei's retreat route, but Liu managed to escape by travelling across the mountainous areas. Liu Bei later remarked, [...] "(Sun) Huan was still a child when I visited Jing, but now he is forcing me to this extent!" [...] After the battle, Sun Huan came to see Lu Xun and he told the latter, [...] "Earlier on, I was indeed very resentful when you refused to help me. But now, after the victory, I <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have your own style of despatching the troops." ...|$|E
2500|$|Part of {{the reason}} Dewey ran such a cautious, vague {{campaign}} came from {{his experience as a}} presidential candidate in 1944. In that election, Dewey felt that he had allowed Roosevelt to draw him into a partisan, verbal [...] "mudslinging" [...] match, and he believed that this had cost him votes. As such, Dewey was convinced in 1948 to appear as non-partisan as possible, and to emphasize the positive aspects of his campaign while ignoring his opponent. This strategy proved to be a major mistake, as it allowed Truman to repeatedly criticize and ridicule Dewey, while Dewey never answered any of Truman's criticisms. Near the end of the campaign, Dewey considered adopting a more aggressive style and responding directly to Truman's criticisms, {{going so far as to}} tell his aides one evening that he wanted to [...] "tear to shreds" [...] a speech draft and make it more critical of the Democratic ticket. However, nearly all of his major advisors – including Edwin Jaeckle, Press Secretary James Hagerty, and aide Paul Lockwood – insisted that it would be a mistake to change tactics. Dewey's wife Frances strongly opposed her husband changing tactics, telling him, [...] "If I have to stay up all night to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't tear up that speech , I will." [...] Dewey relented and continued to ignore Truman's attacks and to focus on positive generalities instead of issue specifics.|$|E

During an 1881 Christmas party, Josie's mother, Josephine, walked {{hand in hand with}} Maud to Frank and introduced them to each other, saying, [...] "This is my nephew, Frank. Frank, I want you to know Maud Gage. I'm sure you will love her." [...] Frank replied, [...] "Consider yourself loved Miss Gage", whereupon Maud countered, [...] "Thank you, Mr. Baum. That's a promise. Please <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> live up to it." [...] Not a week elapsed before Frank was certain he was drawn to her; however, she had other beaus. The two were merely friends when she continued her second year in college and Frank went back to working in the theater. On May 15, 1882, Maud traveled to Syracuse to watch Frank perform in The Maid of Arran. In the summer of that year, Frank paid frequent visits to Maud by using his father's horse and buggy to travel eight miles from his theater company in Syracuse to Maud's house in Fayetteville. Not only in awe of Maud's beauty, Frank was also captivated by her poise and sagacity. For Maud, as she {{wrote in a letter to}} a friend, Frank was [...] "very handsome and attractive".|$|E
