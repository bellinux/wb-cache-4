It requires the extension of IN control capabilities for multimedia service provisioning and integration of TMN service management functions and IN functional entities. In this paper, we propose the architecture for the integration of TMN and IN functions using CORBA technology especially focusing on control {{and management of}} IMT- 2000 global roaming service. IN service data function is integrated into TMN management information bases (MIBs) for the centralization of customer profile management. Network to network interface (NNI) <b>signaling</b> <b>information</b> <b>flows</b> of service management are integrated with intersystem management <b>information</b> <b>flows</b> across TMN X interface for the integrated control and management.

40|$|Systems level, genomic and proteomic {{studies in}} the past few years have {{revealed}} that signaling is propagated within large networks of proteins consisting of tens or hundreds of proteins. This view is in direct contrast to traditional reductive approaches focusing on single proteins, which suggested that signaling takes place within simple linear cascades. Thus, to fully understand cellular responses to signaling, systems-wide approaches are needed. In particular, complete network understanding and integration requires identifying the contribution of individual components of these networks to the global cellular responses and the branch-points of a particular signaling pathway. Such a complete picture can only come from the analysis of global cellular responses, such as microarray and proteome sampling; to understand the directionality of <b>signaling</b> <b>information</b> <b>flow,</b> network reconstruction requires sophisticated statistical and computational tools.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{architectural}} {{structure of}} cellular networks {{provides a framework}} for innovations as well as constraints for protein evolution. This issue has previously been studied extensively by analyzing protein interaction networks. However, {{it is unclear how}} signaling networks influence and constrain protein evolution and conversely, how protein evolution modifies and shapes the functional consequences of signaling networks. In this study, we constructed a human signaling network containing more than 1, 600 nodes and 5, 000 links through manual curation of signaling pathways, and analyzed the d N / d S values of human-mouse orthologues on the network. Results We revealed that the protein d N / d S value decreases along the <b>signal</b> <b>information</b> <b>flow</b> from the extracellular space to nucleus. In the network, neighbor proteins tend to have similar d N / d S ratios, indicating neighbor proteins have similar evolutionary rates: co-fast or co-slow. However, different types of relationships (activating, inhibitory and neutral) between proteins have different effects on protein evolutionary rates, i. e., physically interacting protein pairs have the closest evolutionary rates. Furthermore, for directed shortest paths, the more distant two proteins are, the less chance they share similar evolutionary rates. However, such behavior was not observed for neutral shortest paths. Fast evolving signaling proteins have two modes of evolution: immunological proteins evolve more independently, while apoptotic proteins tend to form network components with other signaling proteins and share more similar evolutionary rates, possibly enhancing rapid information exchange between apoptotic and other signaling pathways. Conclusion Major network constraints on protein evolution in protein interaction networks previously described have been found for signaling networks. We further uncovered how network characteristics affect the evolutionary and co-evolutionary behavior of proteins and how protein evolution can modify the existing functionalities of signaling networks.

40|$|The brain uses a {{strategy}} of labor division, which may allow it to accomplish more elaborate and complicated tasks, but in turn, imposes a requirement for central control to integrate information among different brain areas. Anatomically, the divergence of long-range neuromodulator projections appears well-suited to coordinate communication between brain areas. Oscillatory brain activity is a prominent feature of neural transmission. Thus, the ability of neuromodulators to modulate signal transmission in a frequency-dependent manner adds an additional level of regulation. Here, we review the significance of frequency-dependent signal modulation in brain function and how a neuronal network can possess such properties.

40|$|Variability in the {{complexity}} of the source dynamics across the sources in an activated network may be indicative of how the information is processed within the network. Information-theoretic tools allow one not only to characterize local brain dynamics but also to describe interactions between distributed brain activity. This study follows such a framework and explores the relations between signal complexity and asymmetry in mutual interdependencies in a data-driven pipeline of nonlinear analysis of neuromagnetic sources reconstructed from human magnetoencephalographic (MEG) datacollected during a face recognition task. Asymmetry in nonlinear interdependencies in the network was analyzed using transfer entropy. Complexity of the time series was estimated as multi-scaleentropy. The empirical results are supported by an analysis of synthetic data based on the dynamics of coupled systems with time delay in coupling. We found that the amount of information transferred from one source to another was correlated with the difference in complexity between the dynamics of these two sources, with the directionality of dominant <b>information</b> <b>flow</b> depending on the time scale at which {{the complexity}} was computed. The results based on synthetic data suggest that both time delay and strength of coupling can contribute to the relations between complexity of brain <b>signals</b> and <b>information</b> <b>flow</b> between them.

We distinguish the information units ‘time', 'entity', and ‘predicate' and specifically investigate how speakers mark the information structure of their utterances and enhance discourse cohesion in contexts where the predicate contains given information {{but there is a}} change in {{one or more of the}} other information units. Germanic languages differ from Romance languages in the availability of a set of assertion-related particles (e. g. doch/toch, wel; roughly meaning ‘indeed') and the option of highlighting the assertion component of a finite verb independently of its lexical content (verum focus). Based on elicited production data from 20 native speakers per language, we show that speakers of Dutch and German relate utterances to one another by focussing on this assertion component, and propose an analysis of the additive scope particles ook/auch (also) along similar lines. Speakers of Romance languages tend to highlight change or maintenance in the other information units. Such differences in the repertoire have consequences for the selection of units that are used for anaphoric linking.

40|$|We {{investigate}} <b>information</b> <b>flow</b> in two-tier supply chains, where retailers {{order from}} suppliers and sell {{in a market}} with uncertain demand. The retailers each {{have access to a}} demand signal and can exchange <b>signals</b> (horizontal <b>information</b> sharing). The suppliers can offer the retailers differential payments to gain access to their <b>signals</b> (vertical <b>information</b> acquisition). We demonstrate that retailer competition is a necessary condition to sustain <b>information</b> <b>flow,</b> whereas supplier competition precludes vertical information acquisition. Facing horizontal competition, the retailers can have an incentive to exchange signals if competition is less intense; and this incentive is stronger when they order from independent suppliers than when they order from a monopolist supplier. In the setting where two retailers order from a monopolist supplier, once the retailers exchange signals, the supplier will acquire signals from them both; otherwise, it will have an incentive to acquire signals if the signals are sufficiently correlated. It can be incentive compatible for horizontal information sharing and vertical information acquisition to coexist so that the retailers' signals are available to all parties.

40|$|Software pervades {{our society}} deeper with every year. This trend makes {{software}} security {{more and more}} important. For instance, software systems running critical infrastructures like power plants must withstand criminal or even terrorist attacks, but also smartphone apps used by consumers in their daily routine are usually expected to operate securely. In particular, before entrusting a program with confidential information (such as, e. g., image or audio data recorded by a smartphone), {{one wants to be}} sure that the program is trustworthy and does not leak the secrets to untrusted sinks (such as, e. g., an untrusted server on the Internet). <b>Information</b> <b>flow</b> properties characterize such confidentiality requirements by restricting the <b>flow</b> of confidential <b>information,</b> and an <b>information</b> <b>flow</b> analysis permits to check that a program respects those restrictions. The problem of <b>information</b> <b>flow</b> in multi-threaded programs is particularly challenging, because <b>information</b> <b>flows</b> can originate in subtle ways from the interplay between threads. Moreover, the existence of such <b>information</b> <b>flows</b> depends on the scheduler, which might not even be known when analyzing a program. To obtain high assurance that no leak is overlooked in an <b>information</b> <b>flow</b> analysis, formally well-founded analyses provide a rigorous solution. Such analyses are proven sound with respect to formal <b>information</b> <b>flow</b> properties that specify precisely what restrictions on <b>information</b> <b>flow</b> mean. In this thesis, we develop two novel <b>information</b> <b>flow</b> properties for multi-threaded programs, FSI-security and SIFUM-security. These properties are scheduler-independent, i. e., they characterize secure <b>information</b> <b>flow</b> for different schedulers simultaneously. Moreover, they are compositional, i. e., they permit to break down the analysis of a multi-threaded program to single threads. For both properties we develop a security analysis based on a security type system that is proven sound with respect to the property. Compared to existing scheduler-independent <b>information</b> <b>flow</b> properties, FSI-security is less restrictive. In particular, FSI-security is the first scheduler-independent <b>information</b> <b>flow</b> property that permits programs with nondeterministic behavior and programs whose control flow depends on secrets. The security analysis based on SIFUM-security is the first provably sound flow-sensitive <b>information</b> <b>flow</b> analysis for multi-threaded programs in the form of a security type system. Flow-sensitivity results in increased analysis precision by taking the order of program statements into account. The key in our development of SIFUM-security and the corresponding flow-sensitive analysis for multi-threaded programs was to adopt assumption-guarantee style reasoning to <b>information</b> <b>flow</b> security. We integrate FSI-security and SIFUM-security into the novel property FSIFUM-security, and we integrate the security analyses for FSI- and SIFUM-security into a security analysis for FSIFUM-security. Thereby, FSIFUM-security and the corresponding analysis inherit the advantages of both FSI- and SIFUM-security. In addition to developing novel type-based <b>information</b> <b>flow</b> analyses we also explore <b>information</b> <b>flow</b> analysis for multi-threaded programs with program dependence graphs (PDGs) which is used successfully to analyze sequential programs. To this end, we develop a formal connection between PDG-based and type-based <b>information</b> <b>flow</b> analysis for sequential programs. We exploit the connection to transfer concepts from our type-based analysis for multi-threaded programs to PDGs, resulting in a provably sound PDG-based <b>information</b> <b>flow</b> analysis for multi-threaded programs. Beyond this, we also use the connection to transfer concepts from PDGs to type systems and to precisely compare the precision of a type-based and a PDG-based <b>information</b> <b>flow</b> analysis. Our results provide foundations for more precise and more widely applicable <b>information</b> <b>flow</b> analysis for multi-threaded programs, and we hope that they contribute to a more wide-spread certification of <b>information</b> <b>flow</b> security for concurrent programs...|$|R
