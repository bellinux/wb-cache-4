5|$|Cathodoluminescence (CL) — light {{emission}} excited by electron beam — {{is a process}} commonly observed in TV screens. An electron beam can be finely focused and scanned across the studied material. This technique is widely used to study defects in semiconductors and nanostructures with nanometer-scale <b>spatial</b> <b>resolution.</b> It would be beneficial to apply this technique to carbon nanotubes. However, no reliable CL, i.e. sharp peaks assignable to certain (n,m) indices, has been detected from carbon nanotubes yet.|$|E
5|$|In {{experimental}} particle physics, liquid krypton is used {{to construct}} quasi-homogeneous electromagnetic calorimeters. A notable example is the calorimeter of the NA48 experiment at CERN containing about 27 tonnes of liquid krypton. This usage is rare, since liquid argon is less expensive. The advantage of krypton is a smaller Molière radius of 4.7cm, which provides excellent <b>spatial</b> <b>resolution</b> with little overlapping. The other parameters relevant for calorimetry are: radiation length of X0=4.7cm, and density of 2.4 g/cm3.|$|E
5|$|Invasive {{measures}} include electrocorticography, {{which uses}} electrodes placed {{directly on the}} exposed surface of the brain. This method is used in cortical stimulation mapping, {{used in the study}} of the relationship between cortical areas and their systemic function. By using much smaller microelectrodes, single-unit recordings can be made from a single neuron that give a high <b>spatial</b> <b>resolution</b> and high temporal resolution. This has enabled the linking of brain activity to behaviour, and the creation of neuronal maps.|$|E

The paper presents an investigation about the enhancement of SAR <b>spatial</b> <b>resolutions</b> with the use of circular aperture. A comparison between the <b>spatial</b> <b>resolutions</b> obtained with a SAR system synthesizing a circular aperture and with the same SAR system synthesizing a linear aperture is therefore carried out. The studying results are verified by the experimental SAR data set provided by the experimental ground-based SAR system of Blekinge Institute of Technology (BTH GB-SAR) ...|$|R
40|$|Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) is a {{well known}} {{technique}} which provides high-resolution radar images of moving targets. To obtain effective ISAR images, <b>spatial</b> <b>resolutions</b> should be small enough {{with respect to the}} target size. However, due to the bandwidth and Coherent Processing Interval (CPI) limitation achieving high enough <b>spatial</b> <b>resolutions</b> is a challenging task for existing radar imaging systems. This motivates the need for Super Resolution (SR) techniques. In this paper, a two-dimensional Compressive Sensing (CS) algorithm is investigated for the reconstruction of an ISAR image with enhanced <b>spatial</b> <b>resolutions</b> and tested on real data...|$|R

5|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{has good}} <b>spatial</b> <b>resolution</b> (~0.5 micrometers) and sensitivity (single nanotubes); it requires only minimal sample preparation and is rather informative. Consequently, Raman spectroscopy {{is probably the}} most popular technique of carbon nanotube characterization. Raman scattering in SWCNTs is resonant, i.e., only those tubes are probed which have one of the bandgaps equal to the exciting laser energy. Several scattering modes dominate the SWCNT spectrum, as discussed below.|$|E

Rather than CCDs these three instruments used photon-counting digicons as their detectors. The FOC was constructed by ESA, while the University of California, San Diego, and Martin Marietta Corporation built the FOS.|$|E

5|$|The two Voyager {{spacecraft}} {{made the}} first close-up images of Enceladus. Voyager 1 {{was the first to}} fly past Enceladus, at a distance of 202,000km on November 12, 1980. Images acquired from this distance had very poor <b>spatial</b> <b>resolution,</b> but revealed a highly reflective surface devoid of impact craters, indicating a youthful surface. Voyager 1 also confirmed that Enceladus was embedded in the densest part of Saturn's diffuse E ring. Combined with the apparent youthful appearance of the surface, Voyager scientists suggested that the E ring consisted of particles vented from Enceladus's surface.|$|E
5|$|So far {{the only}} {{close-up}} images of Oberon {{have been from}} the Voyager 2 probe, which photographed the moon during its flyby of Uranus in January 1986.

40|$|The {{transfer}} of parameter sets over different temporal and <b>spatial</b> <b>resolutions</b> is {{common practice in}} many large-domain hydrological modelling studies. The degree to which parameters are transferable across temporal and <b>spatial</b> <b>resolutions</b> is an indicator of how well spatial and temporal variability is represented in the models. A large degree of transferability may well indicate a poor representation of such variability in the employed models. To investigate parameter transferability over resolution {{in time and space}} we have set up a study in which the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model for the Thur basin in Switzerland was run with four different <b>spatial</b> <b>resolutions</b> (1  km [*]×[*]  1  km, 5  km [*]×[*]  5  km, 10  km [*]×[*]  10  km, lumped) and evaluated for three relevant temporal resolutions (hour, day, month), both applied with uniform and distributed forcing. The model was run 3150 times using the Hierarchical Latin Hypercube Sample and the best 1  % of the runs was selected as behavioural. The overlap in behavioural sets for different <b>spatial</b> and temporal <b>resolutions</b> was used as an indicator of parameter transferability. A key result from this study is that the overlap in parameter sets for different <b>spatial</b> <b>resolutions</b> was much larger than for different temporal resolutions, also when the forcing was applied in a distributed fashion. This result suggests that it is easier to transfer parameters across different <b>spatial</b> <b>resolutions</b> than across different temporal resolutions. However, the result also indicates a substantial underestimation in the spatial variability represented in the hydrological simulations, suggesting that the high spatial transferability may occur because the current generation of large-domain models has an inadequate representation of spatial variability and hydrologic connectivity. The results presented in this paper provide a strong motivation to further investigate and substantially improve the representation of spatial and temporal variability in large-domain hydrological models...|$|R
40|$|Studying the {{structure}} of real complex systems {{is of paramount importance}} in science and engineering. Despite our understanding of lots of real systems, we hardly cognize our unique living environment-the earth. The structural complexity of the earth's surface is, however, still unknown in detail. Here, we define the modeling of graph topology for the earth's surface, using the satellite images of the earth's surface under different <b>spatial</b> <b>resolutions</b> derived from Google Earth. We find that the graph topologies of the earth's surface are scale-free networks regardless of the <b>spatial</b> <b>resolutions.</b> For different <b>spatial</b> <b>resolutions,</b> the exponents of power-law distributions and the modularity are both quite different; however, the average clustering coefficient is approximately equal to a constant.

40|$|Validating or {{accessing}} {{the accuracy of}} soft classification maps has rapidly developed {{over the past few}} years. This assessment employs a soft error matrix as generalized from the traditional, hard classification error matrix. However, the impact of positional error on the soft classification is uncertain and whether the well-accepted half-pixel registration accuracy is suitable for the soft classification accuracy assessment is unknown. In this paper, a simulation analysis was conducted to examine the influence of positional error on the overall accuracy (OA) and kappa in soft classification accuracy assessment under different landscape conditions (i. e., spatial characteristics and <b>spatial</b> <b>resolutions).</b> Results showed that with positional error ranging from 0 to 3 soft pixels, the OA-error varied from 0 to 44. 6  percent while the kappa-error varied from 0 to 93. 7 percent. Landscape conditions with smaller mean patch size (MPS) and greater fragmentation produced greater positional error impact on the accuracy measures at <b>spatial</b> <b>resolutions</b> of 1 and 2 unit distances. However, this trend did not hold for <b>spatial</b> <b>resolutions</b> of 5 and 10 unit distances. A half of a pixel was not sufficient to keep the overall accuracy error and kappa error under 10 percent. The results indicate that for soft classification accuracy assessment the requirement for registration accuracy is higher and depends greatly on the landscape characteristics. There is a great need to consider positional error for validating soft classification maps of different <b>spatial</b> <b>resolutions...</b>|$|R
