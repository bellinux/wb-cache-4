Maalin was among the 10,000 volunteers who participated in the effort to eradicate poliomyelitis from Somalia, which succeeded in 2008. He explained his motivation for volunteering: [...] "Somalia was the last country with smallpox. I wanted to help ensure that we would not be the last place with polio too." [...] Maalin worked for WHO as a local coordinator with responsibility for <b>social</b> <b>mobilisation,</b> and spent several years travelling across Somalia, vaccinating children and educating communities. The Boston Globe described him as one of the [...] "most valuable" [...] local coordinators for WHO. He encouraged people to be vaccinated by sharing his experiences with smallpox: [...] "Now when I meet parents who refuse to give their children the polio vaccine, I tell them my story. I tell them how important these vaccines are. I tell them not to do something foolish like me." [...] He continued to work as a regional coordinator for the vaccination drive, and was hailed as one of the [...] "true heroes" [...] of the campaign.|$|E

To that end, the authors begin by analysing the characterisation of the new type of actors that have appeared in recent decades (transnational advocacy networks, Nimbys, Yimbys, «new-new» social move­ments, etc.), as well as the transformation of the State and transnational relations in the new global context. Secondly, the article high­lights the existing interaction between <b>social</b> <b>mobilisations</b> and the structures of domestic and international opportunities, and points {{to the way in which}} different combinations of these elements generate different patterns of activism; on this basis, finally, the authors examine and systematise the contributions of the works of this volume...|$|R

40|$|This thesis investigates how {{characters}} with non-traditional gender are depicted in contemporary Western cinema {{on the basis}} that this depiction illustrates society’s unease with individuals who do not easily confirm to the standard male-female gender binary. Through focussing on four Western feature films (each of which features non-traditionally gendered character in a leading role), the thesis will argue that, despite the surface appearance of accepting the progressive individual, each film actually reinforces traditional <b>social</b> <b>mobilisations</b> of gender. In order to understand how gender is socially mobilised each film will be closely read with a specific focus on camera, lighting, editing, dialogue, sound, costume and script function. The data will be analysed to assess how {{characters with}} non-traditional gender are portrayed on screen and how other characters and social structures respond to them. Although the analysis will reveal concepts of gender progression represented in relatively sophisticated ways, at a deeper level the preferred construction of each of these characters fits within either the male or female gender polarity. Ultimately the thesis will show that within these films the dominant social reaction to people who do not present as either male or female are feared, rejected and ostracised...|$|R
40|$|Through history, the {{relationship}} between poetry and the other fine arts has been an object of numerous studies based mainly on comparative criteria. Poetic language transcends the boundaries of literature, and becomes a key element {{to determine if a}} work is indeed a work of art. The form, perception and execution of the performance, which in its origins was linked to the representative act based on the text as an artistic form of expression, is in the Latin-American context transformed into a protest element in the <b>social</b> <b>mobilisations</b> related to the defence of human rights. The main exponent of performance art in Guatemala, Regina José Galindo (born in 1974), started her career in the field of poetry. Her performances establish formal and functional connections with poetic language, creating metaphors through the subject, object and action, that are used as a catalyst of the message to be transmitted and thus create another type of reception, one that goes beyond the everyday limits that circumscribe both disciplines. The performance metaphors of the artist, besides questioning the social position of women, enable the observer to reach, through identification, the emancipatory experience in its entirety...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This paper aims {{to argue}} that climate justice {{constitutes}} a contested discourse reflecting the material interests of social groups that contribute to its production. For climate justice to have integrity, it must be rooted in the material interests of those social groups negatively affected by, and engaged in struggles against, the hydrocarbon economy. The paper locates contestation of discourse production in an understanding of social movement processes. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is a theoretical contribution to the debate about climate justice, drawing on data (published and unpublished) from Scotland. Findings: The paper concludes that scholars engaged in climate justice work should have consideration to the material interest embedded in the discourse. The pedagogical and dialogical work of engagement with the militant particularism of local struggles against the hydrocarbon industry is {{an important contribution to}} discourse construction, and ultimately social transformation is required to achieve climate justice. Research limitations/implications: This is primarily a theoretical paper, although it draws on limited case study data from environmental conflicts in Scotland. Practical implications: The argument has practical implications for work in climate justice, including research, policy development and <b>social</b> movement <b>mobilisation.</b> <b>Social</b> implications: This is intended as a contribution to the social transformation required to achieve climate justice. Originality/value: The paper draws on existing theoretical frameworks, especially Marxian approaches to discourse and social movement studies, to critique and contribute to the newly developing field of climate justice. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{employs the}} {{political}} process approach within social movement theory (SMT) to examine in a comparative fashion two distinctly different opposition movements in southern Russia. One is the environmental movement in Krasnodar Krai {{and the other is}} the ethno-national Balkar movement in Kabardino-Balkaria. The political process approach focuses on the role and interaction of political opportunities, mobilising structures, and social movement framing for both movements, and seeks to explore their role in <b>social</b> movement <b>mobilisation</b> dynamics in Russia’s non-democratic context. The combination of the analysis of the three variables of political opportunities, mobilising structures, and social movement framing allows for fresh perspectives on both SMT and post-Soviet area studies. The thesis is particularly concerned with networks. It argues that in non-democratic contexts, the role of networks is more important than in democratic contexts...|$|R
40|$|Climate science {{suggests}} that to avoid major impacts from climate change, global {{greenhouse gas emissions}} must peak by 2020 and be reduced to close to zero between 2040 and 2050. This highlights the need for rapid emissions reductions, {{as well as the}} scale and scope of the task. This research identifies non-technical strategies to achieve this ambition, and comes in two parts: contingency plans for national governments, and strategies for citizens acting as a social movement. The first part envisions a scenario in which a sudden major global climate impact galvanises governments to implement emergency climate mitigation programs. It draws upon historical accounts of social, technological and economic restructurings in several countries during World War 2. Wartime experience suggests some potential strategies for rapid climate mitigation in the areas of finance, labour and governance. However, it also has severe limitations, resulting from its lack of democratic processes, and the likelihood that governments may prefer adaptation strategies, or may deploy geoengineering instead of mitigation by a rapid, more sustainable, energy transition. Recent history suggests most governments are unlikely to take effective action without very strong pressure from their peoples. The second part examines the prospect for strengthening the grassroots climate action movement. It draws upon results from a survey of 47 contemporary social action groups across the world, supplemented by accounts of large-scale nonviolent resistance in four countries to develop campaign strategies. It finds that although the movement can be strengthened by employing similar strategies used by previous <b>social</b> <b>mobilisations,</b> the uniqueness of the climate challenge necessitates the design of novel forms of activism. Smaller-scale approaches that highlight the capacity of local and community actions should be prioritised alongside larger, outward-oriented protests. Effective climate action must embed these approaches into our institutions, not only within the political structures of governments but also within the social structures that shape the realities of our everyday lives...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} grassroots mobilisations in France and England {{in support}} {{of children and families}} with no right to remain on the territory. It aims to provide {{a better understanding of the}} influence of 'childhood' as a social concept and 'the child' as a social actor on <b>social</b> <b>mobilisations</b> {{in support of}} 'non-status' children. It also intends to analyse the impact of national contexts on mobilisations. The study is comparative in scope and relies on the analysis of 1, 272 claims made in newspapers and 65 interviews with grassroots campaigners. The thesis first maps the field of contention as it applies to 'non-status' children. It then goes on to investigate actors' pathways into campaigning and their reasons for getting involved and sustaining involvement. It finally considers actors' conscious work to attract and mobilise bystanders. This thesis shows that the presence of children considerably affected campaigning activities. First, children played an important role as key recruiting agents and influential collective actors. Second, childhood as a concept constituted a powerful mobilising factor, and campaigners strategically used the image of the child as innocent and vulnerable when making claims. Overall, mobilisations in support of 'non-status' children and families in France and England presented many similarities, including their strong emotional component and the central role of schools. However, national contexts also played a role in enabling or constraining mobilisations. I identify both structural and discursive differences between the French and English contexts which considerably affected campaigns. In particular, structural differences in the implementation of migration policies had a noticeable effect on campaigners' perceived ability to exert change. Furthermore, mobilisations in France grew into a national network able and willing to make political claims. By contrast, mobilisations in England remained isolated and rarely adopted a political stance, focusing instead on the individual child or family.

40|$|Community-based {{water supply}} {{projects}} in rural South Africa have frequently proved unsustainable, with many communities unable to raise sufficient funds to meet {{operation and maintenance}} costs. A key obstacle to cost recovery (and {{the focus of this}} paper) is the free rider problem. As rural water services are frequently supplied as a public good, the link between paying for water and receiving it is not as straightforward as it is for private goods, and beneficiaries may have a material incentive to ‘free ride’ on the good’s production. Using a simple game-theoretic model, we identify and discuss the value of social sanctioning in deterring free riding. We conclude that social norms that generate costly punishment, such as norms of fairness may be necessary (but not sufficient) to deter free riding. We emphasise the importance of community <b>mobilisation,</b> <b>social</b> intermediation and institution building in overcoming the free rider problem...|$|R
