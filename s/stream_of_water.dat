5|$|The 10th-century Persian {{geographer}} Ibn al-Faqih {{wrote of}} a local legend related {{by the people of}} Lajjun regarding the source of the abundant spring used as the town's primary water source over the ages: there is just outside al-Lajjun a large stone of round form, over which is built a dome, which they call the Mosque of Abraham. A copious <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> flows from under the stone and it is reported that Abraham struck the stone with his staff, and there immediately flowed from it water enough to suffice for the supply {{of the people of the}} town, and also to water their lands. The spring continues to flow down to the present day.|$|E
5|$|To collect water, on 20 June, Bidar Bakht {{and his men}} headed towards Jajau {{without knowing}} that Bahadur Shah was camped there. He came across a village where he found a flowing <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> To inform Azam Shah, he sent his messenger, Iradat Khan, to him with the message. When he returned, he {{informed}} Bidar Bakht {{that he had seen}} Bahadur Shah's advance tents. Khan Alam Dakhvini and Munavvar Khan, who were in charge of the central wing of the troops, were dispatched to attack the tents. Azim-ush-Shan's 500 elephants failed to mount a resistance against the invading forces. The attackers looted the tents and then set them on fire.|$|E
5|$|In this game, Mario {{is joined}} by a robotic {{backpack}} named FLUDD (Flash Liquidizing Ultra Dousing Device), which uses the power of water to clean away goop and help Mario reach new places. Mario starts with two default nozzles for FLUDD, Squirt and Hover, which he can quickly switch between. The Squirt nozzle lets Mario spray a <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> which he can use to clean sludge, attack enemies, and activate certain mechanisms. The Hover nozzle lets Mario hover {{in the air for}} a short period of time, allowing him to cross large gaps while simultaneously spraying things directly below him. As the game progresses, Mario unlocks two additional nozzles for FLUDD which can be substituted with the Hover nozzle: the Rocket nozzle, which shoots Mario high up into the air; and the Turbo nozzle, which moves Mario at high speeds, allowing him to run across water and break into certain areas. Each of FLUDD's nozzles use water from its reserves, which can be refilled via water sources such as rivers or fountains. There are also some areas where FLUDD is taken away from Mario, forcing him to rely on his natural platforming abilities. At certain points in the game, Mario may come across an egg which hatches into a Yoshi after being brought a fruit he asks for. Yoshi can be ridden upon and can attack by spitting juice, which can clear certain obstacles that water cannot. Yoshi can also use his tongue to eat enemies or other pieces of fruit which change his color, depending on the type of fruit. Yoshi will disappear if he runs out of juice or falls into deep water. Juice can be replenished by eating more fruit.|$|E

25|$|The exact {{function}} of the cascade {{is related to the}} methods of extracting the final traces of gold from the crushed ore. There were probably washing tables between the two tanks so that a gentle <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> could be used to wash the ore on the rough surface of the tables, the finer gold being caught in the rougher parts of the tables, and removed {{at the end of the}} process. The cascade would probably have been built towards the end of the 1st century when underground mining commenced following opencast development.|$|E

After a bad start in poor conditions, he fought his way to the front before {{aquaplaning}} across a <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> losing control and crashing into a post holding an advertising sign, sustaining serious head injuries. After nine days in hospital, he died, an outstanding racer, and a great loss to the motorcycling world.|$|E
25|$|When {{looking at}} the {{narratives}} of Jesus found in the Quran, some themes are found in pre-Islamic sources such as the Infancy Gospels about Christ. Much of the qur'anic material about the selection and upbringing of Mary parallels much of the Protovangelium of James, with the miracle of the palm tree and the <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> being found in the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew. In Pseudo-Matthew, the flight to Egypt is narrated similarly to how it is found in Islamic lore, with Syriac translations of the Protoevangelium of James and The Infancy Story of Thomas being found in pre-Islamic sources.|$|E

25|$|While the {{traditional}} {{characteristic of a}} fire appliance {{was a lack of}} water pumping or storage, many modern TLs have a water pumping function built in (and some have their own on-board supply reservoir), and may have a pre-piped waterway running the length of the ladder which directs a <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> to the firefighters at the top. In some cases, there may also be a monitor {{at the top of the}} ladder for ease of use. Other appliances may simply have a track-way which will hold a manually-run hose reel securely, and prevent it from falling to the ground.|$|E
25|$|Some fire engines have a fixed deluge gun, {{also known}} as a master stream, which directs a heavy <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> to {{wherever}} the operator points it. An additional feature of engines are their preconnected hose lines, commonly referred to as preconnects. The preconnects are attached to the engine's onboard water supply and allow firefighters to quickly mount an aggressive attack on the fire as soon as they arrive on scene. When the onboard water supply runs out, the engine is connected to more permanent sources such as fire hydrants or water tenders and can also use natural sources such as rivers or reservoirs by drafting water.|$|E
25|$|To {{limit the}} {{environmental}} impact of returning the brine to the ocean, it can be diluted with another <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> entering the ocean, such as the outfall of a wastewater treatment or power plant. With medium to large power plant and desalination plants, the power plant's cooling water flow is likely to be several times larger than that of the desalination plant, reducing the salinity of the combination. Another method to dilute the brine is to mix it via a diffuser in a mixing zone. For example, once a pipeline containing the brine reaches the sea floor, it can split into many branches, each releasing brine gradually through small holes along its length. Mixing can be combined with power plant or wastewater plant dilution.|$|E

25|$|The Romans used {{hydraulic}} mining methods {{on a large}} scale to prospect for the veins of ore, especially a now-obsolete form of mining known as hushing. They built numerous aqueducts to supply water to the minehead. There, the water stored in large reservoirs and tanks. When a full tank was opened, the flood of water sluiced away the overburden to expose the bedrock underneath and any gold veins. The rock was then worked upon by fire-setting to heat the rock, which would be quenched with a <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> The resulting thermal shock cracked the rock, enabling it to be removed by further streams of water from the overhead tanks. The Roman miners used similar methods to work cassiterite deposits in Cornwall and lead ore in the Pennines.|$|E
25|$|In {{the center}} foreground, the {{fountain}} of life consists of a large <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> ending with a jewel-laden bed. In the distance, a minutely detailed cityscape recalls New Jerusalem. The detail and close attention to landscape and nature is at a level previously unseen in Northern European art. The numerous recognisable species of plants are minutely depicted {{with high levels of}} botanical accuracy. Similarly, the clouds and rock formations in the distance contain degrees of verisimilitude that evince studied observation. The far landscape contains representations of actual churches, while the depiction of the mountains beyond contain the first known example in art of aerial perspective. Yet the panel does not strive for exact realism; the sum of the forensically detailed natural elements, in combination with the apparition of the Holy Spirit and extended beams of light, serve to create a wholly individual and uniquely creative interpretation of a classic biblical scene.|$|E
25|$|Later Krishna told Arjuna how {{he could}} bring down Bhishma, through the help of Sikhandhi. The Pandavas were {{initially}} not agreeable to such a ploy, as by using such cheap tactics {{they would not be}} following the path of Dharma, but Krishna suggested a clever alternative. And thus, on the next day, the tenth day of battle Shikhandi accompanied Arjuna on the latter's chariot and they faced Bhishma who put his bow and arrows down. He was then felled in battle by Arjuna, pierced by innumerable arrows. Using Sikhandhi as a shield, Arjuna shot arrows at Bhishma, piercing his entire body. Thus, as was preordained (Mahadeva's boon to Amba that she would be the cause of Bhishma's death) Shikhandi, that is, Amba reincarnated was the cause of Bhishma's fall. As Bhishma fell, his whole body was held above the ground by the shafts of Arjuna's arrows which protruded from his back, and through his arms and legs. Seeing Bhishma lying on such a bed of arrows humbled even the gods who watched from the heavens in reverence. They silently blessed the mighty warrior. When the young princes of both armies gathered around him, inquiring if there was anything they could do, he told them that while his body lay on the bed of arrows above the ground, his head hung unsupported. Hearing this, many of the princes, both Kaurava and the Pandava alike brought him pillows of silk and velvet, but he refused them. He asked Arjuna to give him a pillow fit for a warrior. Arjuna then removed three arrows from his quiver and placed them underneath Bhishma's head, the pointed arrow tips facing upwards. To quench the war veteran's thirst, Arjuna shot an arrow into the earth, and a jet <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> rose up and into Bhishma's mouth. It is said that Ganga herself rose to quench her son's thirst.|$|E
