A new recommendation regarding the substance-related environmental monitoring is published in "Environmental Science and Pollution Research" (Rüdel et al., 2009).

Some central points of these articles are picked up and updated in this report. Current topics of major concern are the transformation of pharmaceuticals and its consequences for environmental monitoring and the monitoring of biocides and nanoparticles. Besides other objectives the working group "Soil Chemistry and Soil Ecology" focuses on the development and standardisation of methods for the chemical, physical, and biological characterisation of soil pollution by specific contaminants {{as well as on the}} elaboration of methods for the assessment of potential harmful effects on soil, soil ecology, and on other potentially targeted environmental media.
