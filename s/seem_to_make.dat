5|$|Bats <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> use of {{particularly}} strong venomotion, a rhythmic contraction of venous wall muscles. In most mammals, {{the walls of}} the veins provide mainly passive resistance, maintaining their shape as deoxygenated blood flows through them, but in bats they appear to actively support blood flow back to the heart with this pumping action. Due to their relatively small and lightweight bodies, bats are not at risk of blood flow rushing to their heads when roosting.|$|E
5|$|Bart {{attempts}} to reinspire Krusty by showing him old episodes of the show, but {{he picks up}} on the repetitive nature of his own jokes, and binge drinks in anger. He passes out and has a vision of himself in Jewish Heaven, where he meets Rodney Dangerfield. Rabbi Krustofski then appears and tells Krusty that Jews {{do not believe in}} Heaven, and thus he should do more to help others. An act of kindness does not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> him happier, but Bart takes Krusty to the synagogue, where Rabbi Krustofski's favorite Rabbi recites Krusty's jokes on religion. Krusty therefore deduces that his father did find him funny, and sees him again in Jewish Heaven, where Jesus turns Dangerfield's water into a Bloody Mary.|$|E
5|$|Fast {{transient}} response and low distortion are both characteristic of electrostatics. The driver, being only 0.00137-inch thick and weighing only 3mg, is thus capable of stopping and starting seemingly instantaneously with no damping {{necessary to the}} drive units. However, the design also limits bandwidth to between 40Hz and 10kHz. Kohli of TNT noted that upper register starts to taper above 10kHz and then falls off severely beyond 13kHz, and is 15-20dB down at 20kHz. The speaker's design makes them extremely directional, and the general practice is to toe in the speakers to point directly to the listener. Although a slight deviation did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a difference, it is in practice not possible {{for more than one}} person to enjoy a reasonably balanced sound stage with the ESL.|$|E

25|$|In birds, males {{often have}} a more {{colourful}} appearance and may have features (like the long tail of male peacocks) {{that would seem to}} put the organism at a disadvantage (e.g. bright colors would <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a bird more visible to predators). One proposed explanation for this is the handicap principle. This hypothesis says that, by demonstrating he can survive with such handicaps, the male is advertising his genetic fitness to females—traits that will benefit daughters as well, who will not be encumbered with such handicaps.|$|E
25|$|One {{weakness}} in the but-for test arises in situations where each of several acts alone are sufficient to cause the harm. For example, if both A and B fire what would alone be fatal shots at C at approximately the same time, and C dies, it becomes impossible to say that but-for A's shot, or but-for B's shot alone, C would have died. Taking the but-for test literally {{in such a case}} would <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> neither A nor B responsible for C's death.|$|E

25|$|Although its {{strongly}} conservative {{views on}} theology and ethics might <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the LCMS politically compatible with Protestant evangelicals and fundamentalists in the U.S., the LCMS largely eschews political activity, {{partly out of}} concerns to keep the denomination untainted with potential heresies and also because of its strict understanding of the Lutheran distinction between the Two Kingdoms (see above), which repudiates the primarily Calvinist presuppositions about the totalizing rule of God that informs much, if not most, of U.S. evangelical understanding of politics and Christianity. However, both LCMS and Evangelicals share the common belief that life begins and should be protected by law since conception.|$|E
25|$|The six {{orthodox}} (astika) {{schools of}} thought in Hindu philosophy {{do not agree with}} each other entirely on the question of free will. For the Samkhya, for instance, matter is without any freedom, and soul lacks any ability to control the unfolding of matter. The only real freedom (kaivalya) consists in realizing the ultimate separateness of matter and self. For the Yoga school, only Ishvara is truly free, and its freedom is also distinct from all feelings, thoughts, actions, or wills, and is thus not at all a freedom of will. The metaphysics of the Nyaya and Vaisheshika schools strongly suggest a belief in determinism, but do not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> explicit claims about determinism or free will.|$|E

25|$|As tempting {{as it may}} be to thus view St. Margaret as a {{granddaughter of}} another famous saint, Stephen of Hungary, this popular {{solution}} fails to explain why Stephen's death triggered a dynastic crisis in Hungary, or at least that Agatha's family failed {{to play a role in}} that strife. If St. Stephen and Giselle were indeed Agatha's parents, her offspring would have had a strong claim to the Hungarian crown. Actually, there is no indication in Hungarian sources that any of Stephen's children outlived him. Likewise, all of the solutions involving Henry II would <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Agatha much older than her husband, and prohibitively old at the time of the birth of her last child, Edgar.|$|E
25|$|Bascom {{started making}} portraits in 1801 by tracing the shadow {{cast of the}} sitter by lamp- or candlelight on drawing paper placed on a wall in a dark room. At that time, cutting {{profiles}} was a popular parlor game and an inexpensive form of art. She didn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> many portraits {{in the first decade}} or so of the 19th century; she recorded making portraits just seven times between 1801 and 1808, and {{there was no mention of}} profiles again until 1818, when she made them of the recently deceased son and wife of A. Gould. In 1819 she began making profiles in the evenings. The subject's features and other details were drawn with a pencil.|$|E
25|$|Today Henry Hope is {{best known}} for his summer home, the Villa Welgelegen. Thanks to his command of English, French, and Dutch, he was adept at {{establishing}} far-flung business relationships, and he had many influential friends. He acquired a large art collection and built the villa Welgelegen in Haarlem to house the collection. The villa was erected on the grounds of a former summer home he had acquired in 1769 on the Haarlem border of Heemstede. Building this summer palace, a five-year project, became a summer attraction in its own right, rivaling the neighboring park, Groenendaal, established in Heemstede by his cousin, partner, and neighbor, Jan (John) Hope. In 1781, Henry started receiving uninvited visitors to view the gardens and expansion process. The execution of these ambitious plans did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a dent in his enormous wealth; in 1782, he purchased Hope Lodge (Fort Washington, Pennsylvania) as a wedding gift for the son of his American cousin, Maria Ellis.|$|E

500|$|Hemilepistus reaumuri has a {{significantly}} higher biomass than other herbivores in the Negev Desert, making it {{an important part of}} herbivore–omnivore food chains. They spend the day provisioning their burrows with leaf material {{from the surface of the}} desert, sometimes resting under stones or in crevices of rocks. Their faeces accumulates on the surface, and forms a [...] "faecal embankment", similar to a levee, which demarcates the extent of the home territory of the colony in the burrow.

500|$|The Voyage Home opened theatrically in North America on Thanksgiving weekend, November 26, 1986. Since Star Trek had {{traditionally}} performed poorly internationally, {{the producers}} created a special trailer for foreign markets that de-emphasized the Star Trek {{part of the}} title, as well as retelling the events of The Wrath of Khan and The Search for Spock. Winter recalled that the marketing did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a difference. The Voyage Home was the first Star Trek film shown in the Soviet Union, screened by the World Wildlife Fund on June 26, 1987, in Moscow to celebrate a ban on whaling. Attending the screening with Nimoy, Bennett was amazed the film proved as entertaining to the Russians as it did with American audiences; he said [...] "the single most rewarding moment of my Star Trek life" [...] was when the Moscow audience applauded at McCoy's line, [...] "The bureaucratic mentality is the only constant in the universe. We'll get a freighter." [...] Bennett believed {{it was a clear}} [...] "messenger of what was to come".|$|E

This week alone, NME has spent at least two days having our minds freaked on by its space funk swirl." [...] Pitchforks Evan Minsker labeled it a [...] "Best New Track" [...] and wrote that [...] "the song's a 10-minute R event, traveling from club banger ancient Egypt ('send the cheetahs to the tomb') to the slow jam strip club('she's workin' at the Pyramid tonight'). It's a journey well-suited to Ocean's smooth croon." [...] The publication's Ryan Dombal commented, [...] "essentially reincarnates {{one of the most}} storied female rulers in history as a six-inch-heeled woman of the night. However, the song doesn't read as an indictment of the last 2,000 years as much as yet another attempt to cleverly level the playing field." [...] The Telegraphs Neil McCormick stated that the track was the [...] "real miracle of the album", noting that while Ocean [...] "can embark on something as flamboyant as Pyramids - a 10-minute, tempo-shifting, minor-chord narrative of Egyptian queens and Las Vegas strippers, marrying Tangerine Dream sequencers and a jazzy John Mayer guitar solo to a rapturous slow jam – and make it all <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sense." ...|$|E
500|$|In Eusebius' Martyrs of Palestine, Egypt {{is covered}} only in passing. When Eusebius {{remarks on the}} region, however, he writes of tens, twenties, even {{hundreds}} of Christians put to death on a single day, which would <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Egypt the region that suffered the most during the persecutions. According to one report that Barnes calls [...] "plausible, if unverifiable", 660 Christians were killed in Alexandria alone between 303 and 311. In Egypt, Peter of Alexandria fled his namesake city {{early on in the}} persecution, leaving the Church leaderless. Meletius, bishop of Lycopolis (Asyut), took up the job in his place. Meletius performed ordinations without Peter's permission, which caused some bishops to complain to Peter. Meletius soon refused to treat Peter as any kind of authority, and expanded his operations into Alexandria. According to Epiphanius of Salamis, the Church split into two sections: the [...] "Catholic Church", under Peter, and, after Peter's execution, Alexander; and the [...] "Church of the Martyrs" [...] under Meletius. When the two groups found themselves imprisoned together in Alexandria during the persecution, Peter of Alexandria drew up a curtain {{in the middle of their}} cell. He then said: [...] "There are some who are of my view, let them come over on my side, and those of Melitius's view, stay with Melitius." [...] Thus divided, the two sects went on with their affairs, purposely ignoring each other's existence. The schism continued to grow throughout the persecution, even with its leaders in jail, and would persist long after the deaths of both Peter and Meletius. Fifty-one bishoprics are attested for Egypt in 325; fifteen are only known otherwise as seats of the schismatic Church.|$|E
