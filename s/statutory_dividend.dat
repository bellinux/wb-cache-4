2500|$|Although an {{instrument}} of the U.S. Government, the Federal Reserve System considers itself [...] "an independent central bank because its monetary policy decisions {{do not have to}} be approved by the President or anyone else in the executive or legislative branches of government, it does not receive funding appropriated by the Congress, and the terms of the members of the Board of Governors span multiple presidential and congressional terms." [...] The federal government sets the salaries of the board's seven governors. The federal government receives all the system's annual profits, after a <b>statutory</b> <b>dividend</b> of 6% on member banks' capital investment is paid, and an account surplus is maintained. In 2015, the Federal Reserve made a profit of $100.2 billion and transferred $97.7 billion to the U.S. Treasury.|$|E
5000|$|.....the [...] "ownership" [...] of the Reserve Banks by the {{commercial}} banks is symbolic; {{they do not}} exercise the proprietary control associated {{with the concept of}} ownership nor share, beyond the <b>statutory</b> <b>dividend,</b> in Reserve Bank [...] "profits." ...Bank ownership and election at the base are therefore devoid of substantive significance, despite the superficial appearance of private bank control that the formal arrangement creates.|$|E
5000|$|Regarding the {{structural}} {{relationship between the}} twelve Federal Reserve banks and the various commercial (member) banks, political science professor Michael D. Reagan has written that: ... the [...] "ownership" [...] of the Reserve Banks by the commercial banks is symbolic; they do not exercise the proprietary control associated {{with the concept of}} ownership nor share, beyond the <b>statutory</b> <b>dividend,</b> in Reserve Bank [...] "profits." ...

40|$|This study {{presents}} an empirical {{analysis of the}} impact of statutory minimum share capital and equity requirements, dividend restrictions and thin capitalization rules on companies’ capital structure. The study is based on the information available from the Amadeus database in respect of a sample of companies of the EU countries. The results of the study give support to the hypothesis that companies operating in the conditions of <b>statutory</b> maximum <b>dividend</b> restrictions tend to have a lower demand for debt. The existence of thin capitalisation rules appears to decrease companies’ debt utilization. Requirements concerning minimum share capital and equity levels do not seem to {{have a significant impact on}} companies’ capital structure. Further econometric analysis of the above issues with the incorporation of various micro and macro level control variables would be needed to substantiate these preliminary results...|$|R
40|$|The United States is {{generally}} a tax haven for foreign portfolio investors: the United States exempts from tax most U. S. source interest and capital gains, but taxes dividends from U. S. companies; tax treaties generally eliminate U. S. tax on interest {{and reduce the}} 30 % <b>statutory</b> rate on <b>dividends.</b> Foreign investors in U. S. mutual funds have not been treated as favorably. Fund distributions (other than of net capital gains) were originally treated as taxable dividends, regardless of the fund’s underlying income. Interest or short-term capital gains earned by the mutual fund — {{which would have been}} tax exempt if directly earned by a foreign investor — were converted into taxable dividend income when distributed. To encourage foreign investment in U. S. mutual funds, Congress in 2004 modified the mutual fund distribution rules to exempt from tax fund dividends that are attributable to the fund’s U. S. source interest income or short-term capital gains. The stated goal of the legislation was to tax foreign investors on the same basis as if they had directly earned their share of a fund’s income. These provisions fail to fully achieve this goal by denying pass-through treatment for foreign source interest and dividends. This policy appears to be aimed at preventing foreign investors from using a U. S. mutual fund to obtain U. S. treaty benefits. Foreign source income should retain its source and character when distributed to foreign shareholders. This tax treatment is consistent with the tax results a foreign investor realizes when he or she invests directly or through a partnership and encourages foreign investment in mutual funds that invest globally. The treaty shopping concerns may be illusory. To address potential treaty abuse, Congress could consider limiting the pass- through of foreign source income to treaty residents...|$|R
5000|$|.....the member banks can exert some {{rights of}} {{ownership}} by electing {{some members of the}} Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve Bank to those member banks. For all practical purposes, however, member bank ownership of the Federal Reserve System is merely a fiction. The Federal Reserve Banks are not operated for the purpose of earning profits for their stockholders. The Federal Reserve System does earn a profit in the normal course of its operations, but these profits, above the 6% <b>statutory</b> <b>dividend,</b> do not belong to the member banks. All net earnings after expenses and dividends are paid to the Treasury.|$|E
5000|$|According to {{the board}} of {{governors}} of the Federal Reserve, [...] "It is not 'owned' by anyone and is 'not a private, profit-making institution'. Instead, it is an independent entity within the government, having both public purposes and private aspects." [...] The U.S. Government does not own shares in the Federal Reserve System or its component banks, but does receive all of the system's annual profits after a <b>statutory</b> <b>dividend</b> of 6% on their capital investment is paid to member banks and a capital account surplus is maintained. The government also exercises some control over the Federal Reserve by appointing and setting the salaries of the system's highest-level employees.|$|E

5000|$|According to the Board of Governors, the Federal Reserve is {{independent}} within government in that [...] "its decisions {{do not have}} to be ratified by the President or anyone else in the executive or legislative branch of government." [...] However, its authority is derived from the U.S. Congress and is subject to congressional oversight. Additionally, the members of the Board of Governors, including its chairman and vice-chairman, are chosen by the President and confirmed by Congress. The government also exercises some control over the Federal Reserve by appointing and setting the salaries of the system's highest-level employees. Thus the Federal Reserve has both private and public aspects. The U.S. Government receives all of the system's annual profits, after a <b>statutory</b> <b>dividend</b> of 6% on member banks' capital investment is paid, and an account surplus is maintained. In 2010, the Federal Reserve made a profit of $82 billion and transferred $79 billion to the U.S. Treasury.|$|E
40|$|We {{provide a}} new {{explanation}} for cross-sectional variation in dividend tax capitalization. Our analysis is twofold. First, we conduct a theoretical analysis {{that shows that}} liquidity (illiquidity) mitigates (magnifies) {{the positive effect of}} dividend taxes on expected rates of return documented in prior literature. Second, we conduct an empirical analysis centered around the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief and Reconciliation Act of 2003, which reduced the difference between the maximum <b>statutory</b> <b>dividend</b> and capital gains tax rates, and find results consistent with our theory. We also provide results suggesting that institutional ownership’s mitigating effect on dividend tax capitalization documented in prior studies is attributable to stocks with greater institutional ownership being more liquid and not to the “marginal investor” being insensitive to dividend taxes...|$|E
