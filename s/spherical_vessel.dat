Purpose of the work: development of scientifically substantiated recommendations on {{the selection of}} production parameters of the superplastic moulding process to provide for manufacture of <b>spherical</b> <b>vessels</b> with prescribed characteristics. A finite-element model is developed for {{the process of the}} superplastic moulding of vessels from sheet semi-finished products. Determined for the first time is the relationship between the geometrical parameters of <b>spherical</b> <b>vessels</b> and sheet semi-finished products. The process of production of <b>spherical</b> <b>vessels</b> with a homogeneous microcrystalline structure from titanium sheet alloys is developed for the first time. New production approaches are proposed for the manufacture of coverings from sheet blanks. The results of the work are used during manufacture of spherical bottles and floats. The parts manufactured according to the new production process provide for an increase in the material utilization coefficient up to 0. 75 and for a decrease in the power consumption 1. 6 times and of the capital expenditure 2. 5 times.

40|$|<b>Spherical</b> {{pressure}} <b>vessels</b> {{are used}} to fully contain the effects of high explosions. In this paper, the vibrations of a <b>spherical</b> containment <b>vessel</b> undergoing elastic response are investigated. Vibration modes of containment vessels are of particular interest, {{as it is the}} superposition and interaction of different modes of response with closely spaced frequencies that has been reported to be the mechanism of 'strain growth'. First, the modal frequencies of a spherical shell for both axisymmetric and nonaxisymmetric response modes are discussed, based on a sequence of papers that have appeared in the open literature. Analytical predictions are then compared with numerical simulations using ABAQUS. It is found that the numerical simulations accurately predict both the axisymmetric and nonaxisymmetric modal frequencies for the complete spherical shell. Next, numerical simulations of modal frequencies for the more complex <b>spherical</b> containment <b>vessel</b> (with nozzles) are compared with the spherical shell results. Numerical simulations for the <b>spherical</b> containment <b>vessel</b> reveal that frequencies are somewhat similar to the complete spherical shell.

40|$|AbstractThe {{experiment}} {{was conducted on}} airtight explosion process of methane-air mixture in sphere- vessels linked by pipes. The impact {{of the length of}} pipes on the explosion pressure inside the vessels is analyzed through experiments by linking airtight vessels with pipes in different length. It can be concluded that when the single-sphere links the pipes, both values of the maximum explosion pressure and the rising rate of maximum pressure inside the <b>spherical</b> <b>vessel,</b> big or small, follow the trend of decreasing step by step. Meanwhile, the rising rate of maximum pressure and the volume of the vessel meet the cube root law. When the small <b>spherical</b> <b>vessel</b> connects the pipes, pressure inside the pipes is on the increase first, then decreases, after that increase again. While the big <b>spherical</b> <b>vessel</b> links the pipes, the pressure inside the pipes is on the decrease first, then increases, after that increase again. The rising rate of maximum pressure in the connecting set-up consisting of big and small <b>spherical</b> <b>vessel</b> is far higher than that in the single vessels. And the rising rate in the initiating vessel is slower than that in the secondary vessel. Given the growing length of pipes in the connecting set-up consisting of big and small <b>spherical</b> <b>vessel,</b> the values of maximum explosion pressure in secondary vessels gradually grows, despite gas is ignited in the big or small vessels; however, as regards to the pressure in the initiating vessels, the values of pressure in the big <b>spherical</b> <b>vessel</b> is on the decrease step by step and finally reaches a static figure, if gas is ignited in the big one. While the values of pressure in the small <b>spherical</b> <b>vessel</b> follow the trend of decreasing first, then increasing, finally declining to a static figure. As the devices of the connecting set-up are on the increase, the speed-decline of the pressure in the vessels accelerates.
