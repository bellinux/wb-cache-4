50|$|TIFF {{was created}} {{as an attempt}} to get desktop scanner vendors of the mid-1980s to agree on a common <b>scanned</b> <b>image</b> <b>file</b> format, in place of a {{multitude}} of proprietary formats. In the beginning, TIFF was only a binary image format (only two possible values for each pixel), because that was all that desktop scanners could handle. As scanners became more powerful, and as desktop computer disk space became more plentiful, TIFF grew to accommodate grayscale images, then color images. Today, TIFF, along with JPEG and PNG, is a popular format for deep-color images.|$|E

Documents are best stored in TIFF or PDF format; JPEG is particularly unsuitable for text. Optical character recognition (OCR) software allows a scanned image of text to be converted into editable text with reasonable accuracy, {{so long as the}} text is cleanly printed and in a typeface and size that can be read by the software. OCR capability may be integrated into the scanning software, or the <b>scanned</b> <b>image</b> <b>file</b> can be processed with a separate OCR program.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{segmentation}} of printed Bangla characters for efficient recognition of the characters. The segmentation of characters {{is an important step}} in the process of character recognitions because it allows the system to classify the characters more accurately and quickly. The system takes the <b>scanned</b> <b>image</b> <b>file</b> of the printed document as its input. A structural feature extraction method is used to extract the feature. In this case, each individual Bangla character is converted to a M × N feature matrix. A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network with back propagation algorithm is chosen to feed the feature matrix to train with the set of input patterns and to develop knowledge to classify the character. The effectiveness of the system has been tested with several printed documents and the success rates in all cases are over 90 %...|$|E

5000|$|The canvas {{backing of}} the maps are vacuumed; those with {{significant}} damage are repaired with muslin patches and an Ethylene vinyl acetate adhesive. In order to unroll brittle maps, some of which haven't been opened in over 100 years, the conservator and student assistants use a process of humidification, flattening, and drying to safely open the maps without causing additional damage. First, the maps are placed in a large humidity dome. After 5 or 6 hours of absorbing humidity the maps can be safely unrolled. The maps dry flat between polyester webbing and wool felts overnight. The majority of student assistants performing the preservation work are enrolled in the University of Pittsburgh School of Information Sciences. Next, the maps are transferred to the Office of Surface Mining National Mine Map Repository in Green Tree, Pennsylvania, where they are catalogued and scanned into a digital format. The scanning process uses an overhead Cruse scanner that has a suction table for maps that do not lay flat. The <b>scanned</b> <b>image</b> <b>files</b> are recorded in [...]tiff file format. [...] The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection office in California, Pennsylvania prepares then the digital files for use in geographic information system programs for use within the Pennsylvania Historical Underground Mine Maps Inventory System. The original maps are returned to University of Pittsburgh archives for permanent storage.|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{numbers of}} {{research}} libraries {{are turning to}} the Internet for electronic interlibrary loan and for document delivery to patrons. This has been made possible through the widespread adoption of software such as Ariel and DocView. Ariel, {{a product of the}} Research Libraries Group, converts paper-based documents to monochrome bitmapped images, and delivers them over the Internet. The National Library of Medicine's DocView is primarily designed for library patrons to receive, display and manage documents received from Ariel systems. While libraries and their patrons are beginning to reap the benefits of this new technology, barriers exist, e. g., differences in <b>image</b> <b>file</b> format, that lead to difficulties in the use of library document information. To research how to overcome such barriers, the Communications Engineering Branch of the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications, an R&D division of NLM, has developed a web site called the DocMorph Server. This is part of an ongoing intramural R&D program in document imaging that has spanned many aspects of electronic document conversion and preservation, Internet document transmission and document usage. The DocMorph Server web site is designed to fill two roles. First, in a role that will benefit both libraries and their patrons, it allows Internet users to upload <b>scanned</b> <b>image</b> <b>files</b> for conversion to alternative formats, thereby enabling wider delivery and easier usage of library document information. Second, the DocMorph Server provides the design team an active test bed for evaluating the effectiveness and utility of new document image processing algorithms and functions, so that they may be evaluated for possible inclusion in other image processing software products being developed at NLM or elsewh [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Luminosity {{variations}} of natural cloud-to-ground lightning flashes were studied by analyzing {{a set of}} high speed video recordings. The frame rate and resolution of the camera was 5000 fps at 512 × 512 pixel resolution. The frames were stored as black and white sequence (SEQ) files which were converted to sequence of <b>image</b> <b>files</b> using the software provided by the camera. Algorithms were developed to <b>scan</b> the <b>image</b> <b>files</b> and extract maximum brightness of channels as well as maximum brightness at selected locations along the channels. The variation of current along the channel was analyzed by assuming that {{the brightness of the}} channel is directly proportional to the current that flows through it. The study shows that there is a loss of current in lightning channels when current flowing through the channel. The amount of current reduction increases with the propagating distance. Preliminary estimates show that there is approximately 3 % reduction in current when propagation from cloud-to-ground. 1...|$|R

40|$|For {{watermarking}} music scores different information carriers {{have been}} proposed. Dependent on the used information carrier the proposed methods have different strengths. The methods proposed {{so far have}} advantages either in robustness or in capacity. Thus, the potential user of watermarking techniques has to decide which watermarking scheme fits his needs best. Although changing {{the features of the}} musical symbols for embedding a watermark is highly robust, the capacity is limited by the number of musical symbols which are present in the music score which should be watermarked. The method we propose uses the staff lines for embedding information. Its advantage is its independence of the number of musical symbols. Even an empty music score can be watermarked. To increase robustness in comparison to other existing approaches we do not change the thickness of the staff lines. The staff line properties straightness and vertical distances are used for embedding information. Because we are using <b>scanned</b> <b>images</b> as source <b>files,</b> two major parts in the implementation can be identified: staff line detection and geometrical transformation of the image which are described in this article...|$|R

40|$|It is {{a common}} {{activity}} for researchers in materials science, the constant use of <b>scanned</b> <b>images</b> generated by electron microscopes. While virtually all equipment that generate these images (micrographs) can use a file type most suitable for capturing image data generated (as TIFF or RAW files in case of metallography), many researchers choose to use a file format more common as JPEG, for example, perhaps the reason of the space available on portable storage devices (USB, CD or DVD) that owns, or {{by the lack of}} knowledge about the types of <b>image</b> <b>files</b> and their appropriate use. The problem with the use of certain types of image formats is mainly the loss of the original data captured by an electron microscope.
