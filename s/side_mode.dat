We have measured an intensity squeezing of 1. 2 dB with grating-extended cavity lasers and 1. 4 dB with injection locked lasers (respectively 1. 6 dB and 2. 3 dB inferred at the laser output). We have observed that the intensity noise of a free-running nominally single mode laser diode results from a cancellation effect between large anti-correlated fluctuations of the main mode and of weak longitudinal <b>side</b> <b>modes.</b> Reducing the <b>side</b> <b>modes</b> by line narrowing techniques results in intensity squeezing...|$|R
50|$|There are {{alternatives}} to traditional types of DFB lasers. Traditionally, DFBs are antireflection coated {{on one side}} of the cavity and coated for high reflectivity on the other side (AR/HR). In this case the grating forms the distributed mirror on the antireflection coated side, while the semiconductor facet on the high reflectivity side forms the other mirror. These lasers generally have higher output power since the light is taken from the AR side, and the HR side prevents power being lost from the back side. Unfortunately, during the manufacturing of the laser and the cleaving of the facets, it is virtually impossible to control at which point in the grating the laser cleaves to form the facet. So sometimes the laser HR facet forms at the crest of the grating, sometimes on the slope. Depending on the phase of the grating and the optical mode, the laser output spectrum can vary. Frequently, the phase of the highly reflective side occurs at a point where two longitudinal modes have the same cavity gain, and thus the laser operates at two modes simultaneously. Thus such AR/HR lasers have to be screened at manufacturing and parts that are multimode or have poor <b>side</b> <b>mode</b> suppression ratio (SMSR) have to be scrapped. Additionally, the phase of the cleave affects the wavelength, and thus controlling the output wavelength of a batch of lasers in manufacturing can be a challenge.|$|E
50|$|In {{fiber optics}} and telecommunications, an index-matching {{material}} {{may be used}} in conjunction with pairs of mated connectors or with mechanical splices to reduce signal reflected in the guided mode (known as return loss) (see: Optical fiber connector). Without the use of an index-matching material, Fresnel reflections will occur at the smooth end faces of a fiber unless there is no fiber-air interface or other significant mismatch in refractive index. These reflections may be as high as -14 dB (i.e., 14 dB below the optical power of the incident signal). When the reflected signal returns to the transmitting end, it may be reflected again and return to the receiving end at a level that is (28 plus twice the fiber loss) dB below the direct signal. The reflected signal will also be delayed by twice the delay time introduced by the fiber. The twice-reflected, delayed signal superimposed on the direct signal may noticeably degrade an analog baseband intensity-modulated video signal. Conversely, for digital transmission, the reflected signal will often have no practical effect on the detected signal seen at the decision point of the digital optical receiver except in marginal cases where bit-error ratio is significant. However, certain digital transmitters such as those employing a Distributed Feedback Laser may be affected by back reflection and then fall outside specifications such as <b>Side</b> <b>Mode</b> Suppression Ratio, potentially degrading system bit error ratio, so networking standards intended for DFB lasers may specify a back-reflection tolerance such as -10 dB for transmitters so that they remain within specification even without index matching. This back-reflection tolerance might be achieved using an optical isolator or by way of reduced coupling efficiency.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} the setup {{to create a}} large Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) containing more than 120 million atoms. In the experiment a thermal beam is slowed by a Zeeman slower and captured in a dark-spot magneto-optical trap (MOT). The sample is subsequently spin polarized in a high magnetic field, before the atoms are loaded in the magnetic trap. Spin polarizing in a high magnetic field results {{in an increase in}} the transfer efficiency by a factor of 2 compared to experiments without spin polarizing. In the magnetic trap the cloud is cooled to degeneracy in 50 s by evaporative cooling. This large atom number BEC yields the possibility to enter the hydrodynamic regime by evaporative cooling at a relative low density suppressing the effect of avalanches. The collisional opacity can be tuned from the collisionless regime to a collisional opacity of more than 3 by compressing the trap after condensation. In the collisional opaque regime a significant heating of the cloud at time scales shorter than half of the radial trap period is measured. This is direct proof that the BEC is hydrodynamic. Furthermore a detailed study is presented of superradiant scattering from a BEC. The relation between the depletion of the BEC and the onset of the different <b>side</b> <b>modes</b> as well as the transition from the weak to the strong pulse regime is studied yielding a good insight in the coupling processes between the BEC and the <b>side</b> <b>modes.</b> Finally, a simplified model to {{describe the}} time evolution of the process is presented. The model gives a good quantitative description of the fraction of atoms coupled to different <b>side</b> <b>modes,</b> showing that the approximations made in the modeling are valid. Also the atom pair production by superradiant backward-scattering from a Bose-Einstein condensate is investigated. In our experiment the energy in the process is conserved by using a pulse with two frequencies. This makes the process resonant, which gives full control over the number of atoms in the different recoil modes. It is shown that resonant backward-scattering produces strongly correlated <b>side</b> <b>modes</b> in which number squeezing and phase correlation are likely. This makes resonant superradiant backward-scattering a promising candidate for many-particle entanglement...|$|R

40|$|A mutual pulse injection-seeding {{scheme is}} {{developed}} to generate tunable dual-wavelength optical short pulses {{by the use}} of two gain-switched Fabry-Perot (F-P) semiconductor lasers. Multimode optical short output pulse is first generated by gain switching two F-P lasers with the approximate setup. Then by using two fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) as filters, mutual injection locking of two wavelength optical pulses between two F-P lasers is realized by tuning optical delay line (VODL 2), and dual-wavelength optical short pulse with high <b>side</b> <b>mode</b> suppression ratio is obtained at the output end.

The active section voltage is monitored to maintain mode stability and a highly stable Fabry–Perot etalon {{is used as a}} reference to lock the laser frequency to a specific ITU channel. It is shown that sta-bility can even be maintained when directly modulating the laser at 1. 244 Gb/s. Furthermore, a characterization scheme is demon-strated that uses the voltage monitoring to generate a look-up table of operation points very efficiently and accurately. For all opera-tion points, the frequency accuracy is better than 0 5 GHz and the <b>side</b> <b>mode</b> suppression ratio is above 35 dB.
