40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{transition}} from the extreme greenhouse of the early Paleogene (52 Ma) to the present-day icehouse is the most prominent change in Earth’s Cenozoic climate history. During the late Middle Eocene climate transition (42 - 38 Ma), which preceded the onset of long-lived, continental-scale ice sheets, there is concor-dant evidence for brief pulses (< 1 m. y. in length) of global warmth and ice sheet growth but few constraints on atmospheric CO 2. Here we estimate the concentration of atmospheric CO 2 during this critical interval using <b>stomatal</b> <b>indices</b> of fossil Metasequoia needles from ten levels in an exceptionally well-preserved core from the Giraffe kimberlite locality in northwestern Canada. Reconstructed CO 2 concentra-tions are mainly between 700 to 1000 ppm, but include a secular decline to 450 ppm towards {{the top of the}} investigated section. Because the CO 2 threshold for nucleating continental ice sheets at this time was 500 to 750 ppm, the CO 2 decline is compatible with a rapid (< 104 yrs) {{transition from}} warm, largely ice-free conditions to cooler climates with ice sheets. These fossils provide direct evidence that high-latitude deciduous forests thrived in the geological past under CO 2 concentrations that will likely be reached within the 21 st century (500 - 1000 ppm) ...|$|R

A baseline study of leaves stomatal indices, (stomatal as a proportional of all epidermal cells) stomatal density, (number of stomatal per unit area of epidermis) epidermal cell density, epidermal cell length and stomatal length and width was made in wheat, and sorghum cultivars; Saudi Red, Funk, Indian White, Morgon 854, Morgon 856 and Pioneer 8 ss in relation to water limitation. Seedlings of wheat and sorghum cultivars grown under water limitation showed increases in their stomatal density, epidermal cell density and trichome index in response to reduced watering frequency. <b>Stomatal</b> <b>index</b> of the two species, however, were not altered in the same way. In sorghum there was no apparent change in <b>stomatal</b> <b>index</b> in relation to water limitation treatment but stomatal density and trichome index increased. In wheat there was a marked reduction in the <b>stomatal</b> <b>index</b> in response to water limitation but there were increases in trichome indices and stomatal densities of all parts of the leaves. Wheat plants grown under water limitation imposed by polyethylene glycol (PEG) treatments to roots showed marked reductions in their growth compared with controls. Stomatal density was found to increase in response to PEG treatments while <b>stomatal</b> <b>index</b> decreased. Incubation of newly-germinated wheat seedlings in PEG resulted in an inhibition of growth of coleoptiles. However, the density of stomata decreased, unlike what was seen in leaf tissues. When wheat coleoptiles were subjected to conditions of limited water availability guard mother cell (GMC) production appeared not to be influenced by water status of the tissues. Wheat coleoptiles grown under different periods of light showed slight decreases in stomata density compared to the controls. Abscisic acid treatment was able to substitute for water limitation treatments by reducing <b>stomatal</b> <b>index</b> in both leaves and coleoptiles whilst increasing the production of trichomes in leaves.

In Poland, these plants bloom in May and June and {{are a source of}} abundant spring nectar flow for insects. The floral nectaries of the above-mentioned species were examined using stereoscopic, light, and scanning electron microscopy in order to assess their size and epidermal microstructure.

Extractable hydrocarbons in samples from the fluvial Triassic–Jurassic boundary section at Astartekløft, East Greenland were analyzed to investigate the molecular and isotopic organic record of biotic and environmental change during this event. Carbon isotopic compositions of individual plant wax lipids show a > 4 ‰ negative excursion coinciding with peak extinction and a further decrease of 2 ‰ coinciding with peak pCO 2 as estimated from the <b>stomatal</b> <b>indices</b> of fossil Gingkoales. An increase of ∼ 30 ‰ in the hydrogen isotopic compositions of the same plant wax lipids coincides with ecosystem collapse, suggesting that the biotic crisis was accompanied by strong hydrologic change. Concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons related to combustion also increase together with abrupt plant diversity loss and peak with fossil charcoal abundance and maximum plant turnover, supporting the role of fire in terrestrial extinctions. Anomalously high concentrations of a monoaromatic diterpenoid related to gymnosperm resin derivatives (and similar to dehydroabietane) occur uniquely in samples from the boundary bed, indicating that environmental stress factors leading to peak plant extinction stimulated increased resin production, and that plant resin derivatives may be effective biomarkers of terrestrial ecosystem stress...|$|R

Scanning electron images were obtained to count stomates and cells on leaves collected between 1829 and 2015. Average <b>stomatal</b> <b>index</b> (SI) was then calculated for each year. SI is defined as #stomates/(#stomates + # epidermal cells) * 100. The relationship between <b>stomatal</b> <b>index</b> and atmospheric CO 2 can be expressed in an equation following the form recommended by Wynn (2003), as the most likely representation of the physical laws governing CO 2 diffusion across stomates.

40|$|Guard cells play an {{essential}} role in controlling stomatal aperture and respond to many stimuli including changes in the concentration of CO 2, light and phytohormones such as ABA. In this project, the function of Arabidopsis genes identified by a microarray screen, as being potentially expressed in guard cells was studied. Two genes encoding an Arabidopsis protein kinase APKla, and a putative pectinesterase AP Ea and their closely related genes AP K 1 band AP Eb respectively were studied. GUS reporter gene fusions were constructed for each gene and expressed in Arabidopsis to investigate expression patterns. The results indicated relatively high guard cell expression for at least three of the genes (APKla. APKlb and APEa). Homozygous knockout mutant plants were identified for each gene of the four guard cell target genes by RT-PCR of T-DNA insertion lines. Putative overexpressing plant lines were created by placing three of the genes (AP KI a, AP K 1 band AP Eb) {{under the control of the}} CaMV 355 promoter in transgenic plants. Several physiological techniques were applied to the knockout and over-expressing plant lines to assess whether each gene product had a function in stomatal aperture control or stomatal development. Stomatal conductances were measured using Infra Red Gas Analysis (IRGA) to investigate mutant responses to different light intensities. This suggested an impairment in apkl a and APKl b knockout mutants in stomatal response to light-induced opening. Photosynthetic rate and Ci were measured for apk l a and apklb knockout mutants and no differences to wild-type values were observed. <b>Stomatal</b> <b>indices</b> and densities were examined and no significant differences were found in kinase knockout mutants and over-expressing plants. Stomatal aperture responses of kinase and pectinesterase mutants and putative over-expressers to light. ABA and CO 2 were measured in leaf epidermal strip bioassay experiments. The kinase knockout m utants and putative over-expressers had reduced their stomatal apertures in response to light-induced stomatal opening and showed no differences to controls in dark induced-stomatal closure experiments (apart from APKlaOE which had enhanced dark-induced closure). But the kinase knockout mutants also showed reduced stomatal opening responses to C 02 free air. A variety of responses to ABA-inhibition of stomatal opening and CO 2 -induced closure were exhibited by the kinase mutants and putative over-expressers. Relative water content (RWC) was significantly higher in droughted kinase knockout mutant plants perhaps because of their reduced stomatal opening. It is therefore possible that the AP K 1 a and AP K I b genes may useful in produces drought tolerance plants. Pectinesterase knockout mutants and putative over-expresser lines also had reduced stomatal apertures following exposure to light and no differences to wild-type were obtained following dark adaptation (apart from APEbOE). apea-l, apeb-l and apeb- 2 exhibited insensitivity to ABA and C 02 since they maintained larger stomatal apertures than controls following exposure to ABA and ambient CO 2 • Droughted apea mutant plants had significantly lower relative water content perhaps because of their ABA and CO 2 insensitivity, whereas no significant differences were noticed between apeb mutants and control plants. <b>Stomatal</b> <b>indices</b> and densities were examined and apea and apeb stomatal densities were similar to control when plants were grown under ambient CO 2 but apea mutant plants had higher stomatal densities when grown under either low or elevated C 02.

We determined plant growth and pigment concentrations in leaves and stems and studied leaf anatomy. Important findings Both plants grew best under 13 000 and 18 000 lx and had increased leaf and stem biomass with increased light intensity. Under the same light intensity, stem length, basal stem diameter, blade number, bud length, leaf and stem biomass of D. stramonium var. tatual appeared higher than those of D. stramonium, but most differences were statistically insignificant. Leaf, palisade and spongy thickness and <b>stomatal</b> density and <b>index</b> all increased with increasing light intensity. Under the same light intensity, <b>stomatal</b> density and <b>index</b> of D. stramonium var. tatual were significantly higher than those of D. stramonium.

40|$|The {{link between}} {{atmospheric}} CO 2 levels {{and global warming}} is an axiom of current public policy, and is well supported by physicochemical experiments, by compara-tive planetary climatology and by geochemical modelling. Geological tests of this idea seek to compare proxies of past atmospheric CO 2 with other proxies of palaeotemper-ature. For at least the past 300 Myr, there is a remarkably high temporal correlation between peaks of atmospheric CO 2, revealed by study of <b>stomatal</b> <b>indices</b> of fossil leaves of Ginkgo, Lepidopteris, Tatarina and Rhachiphyllum, and palaeotemperature maxima, revealed by oxygen isotopic (δ 18 O) composition of marine biogenic car-bonate. Large and growing databases on these proxy indicators {{support the idea that}} atmospheric CO 2 and temperature are coupled. In contrast, CO 2 –temperature uncoupling has been proposed from geological time-series of carbon isotopic compo-sition of palaeosols and of marine phytoplankton compared with foraminifera, which fail to indicate high CO 2 at known times of high palaeotemperature. Failure of car-bon isotopic palaeobarometers may be due to episodic release of CH 4, which has an unusually light isotopic value (down to − 110 % %, and typically − 60 % % δ 13 C) and which oxidizes rapidly (within 7 – 24 yr) to isotopically light CO 2. Past CO 2 highs (above 2000 ppmv) were not only times of catastrophic release of CH 4 from clathrates, but of asteroid and comet impacts, flood basalt eruptions and mass extinctions. The pri-mary reason for iterative return to low CO 2 was carbon consumption by hydrolytic weathering and photosynthesis, perhaps stimulated by mountain uplift and changing patterns of oceanic thermohaline circulation.

This implies that these traits are co-evolving, {{but there have been}} few studies addressing plant water relations within an explicitly evolutionary framework. • This study tests for correlated evolution among a suite of plant water-use traits and environmental parameters in seven species of Pereskia (Cactaceae), using phylogenetically independent contrasts. • There were significant evolutionary correlations between leaf-specific xylem hydraulic conductivity, Huber Value, leaf <b>stomatal</b> pore <b>index,</b> leaf venation density and leaf size, but none of these traits appeared to be correlated with environmental water availability; only two water relations traits – mid-day leaf water potentials and photosynthetic water use efficiency – correlated with estimates of moisture regime. • I...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been made}} of: i) Variations in the number and form of the stomata, papillae, and ordinary epidermal cells over the individual leaf. ii) Growth of the leaf with special reference to meristematic activity, and the vascular system. iii) Comparative anatomy of Amaryllidaceous leaves with special reference to the inverted bundle system. Variations in the water supply to the successive intercalary portions of the leaf cause variations {{in the degree of}} expansion of the epidermal cells. This modifies the stomatal frequencies (numbers per unit area) as otherwise determined by the index value (proportion of epidermal units converted into stomata).. The typical frequency gradients are: i. Increasing gradient from base towards the apex of the leaf, with a secondary decrease at the apex. ii. Increasing gradient from the mid-rib to the margin for broad leaves, and decreasing for narrow leaves. <b>Stomatal</b> <b>indices</b> are more constant than frequencies, but give similar gradients. The basal growth of the leaf-limb is due to: i. Meristematic activity and auxesis of the peripheral tissues forming the epidermis and assimilating tissues. ii. Auxesis only of the central ground-tissue. The extent of mature leaf-limb increases during growth but its water supply is limited by the amount that can be conducted through the extending zone. This supply improves due to the lignification of the immature tracheids present in the dormant leaf. In only six genera of the Amaryllidaceae are concentric leaves found excluding the Conostylideae. These leaves have adaxial inverted bundles which were found to differ in their mode of connection with the stem system. They may curve round into the sheathing portion of the leaf-base, passing directly to the stem system as in Ianthe. or they may be independent, ending in groups of storage tracheids in {{the upper part of the}} leaf-base, as in Narcissus poeticus and Zeph vranthes candida. It is difficult to harmonise the results from the two latter with the Phyllode theory. <p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Mature second {{leaves of}} Lolium perenne L. cv. Vigor, were sampled in a {{spring and summer}} {{regrowth}} period. Effects of CO 2 enrichment and increased air temperature on stomatal density, <b>stomatal</b> <b>index,</b> guard cell length, epidermal cell density, epidermal cell length and mesophyll cell area were examined for different positions on the leaf and seasons of growth. Leaf stomatal density was smaller in spring but greater in summer in elevated CO 2 and higher in both seasons in elevated temperature and in elevated CO 2 x temperature relative to the respective controls. In spring, leaf <b>stomatal</b> <b>index</b> was reduced in elevated CO 2 but in summer it varied with position on the leaf. In elevated temperature, <b>stomatal</b> <b>index</b> in both seasons was lower at the tip/middle of the leaf but slightly higher at the base. In elevated CO 2 x temperature, <b>stomatal</b> <b>index</b> varied with position on the leaf and between seasons. Leaf epidermal cell density was higher in all treatments relative to controls except in elevated CO 2 (spring) and elevated CO 2 x temperature (summer), it was reduced at the leaf base. In all treatments, stomatal density and epidermal cell density declined from leaf tip to base, whilst guard cell length showed an inverse relationship, increasing towards the base. Leaf epidermal cell length and mesophyll cell area increased in elevated CO 2 in spring and decreased in summer. In elevated CO 2 x temperature leaf epidermal cell length remained unaltered in spring compared to the control but decreased in summer. Stomatal conductance was lower in all treatments except in summer in elevated CO 2 it was {{higher than in the}} ambient CO 2. These contrasting responses in anatomy to elevated CO 2 and temperature provide information that might account. for differences in seasonal leaf area development observed in L. perenne under the same conditions.

40|$|We used via {{light and}} {{scanning}} electron microscopy to study the leaf epidermis of five Solidago taxa from south-western Poland. Light microscopy was employed to describe the epidermal surface, including stomatal types, the shape of epidermal cell walls, stomatal density, the distribution of stomata between the abaxial and adaxial epi-dermis, and stomatal guard cell length. From these observations we calculated the <b>stomatal</b> <b>index</b> (SI) and stom-atal ratio (SR) {{as the basis for}} defining the type of leaf. From LM of transverse sections of leaf we described mes-ophyll structure, the presence of secretory canals, adaxial and abaxial epidermis thickness, and leaf thickness. We examined cuticular ornamentation, trichome features and epicuticular secretions by SEM. As determined by discriminatory analysis, the most important traits distinguishing these taxa were the <b>stomatal</b> <b>index</b> of the adax-ial epidermis, leaf thickness, features of the walls of epidermal cells, and the presence and features of trichomes. On the basis of observations and measurements we created a key for distinguishing Solidago taxa...|$|E
40|$|Two {{different}} cyanobacterial biofilms from German karstwater creeks {{were investigated}} {{with respect to}} their photosynthetic effect on Ca 2 + removal and potential CaCO 3 precipitation in artificial creek waters of different CO 2 partial pressures at a given, constant calcite supersaturation. CO 2 partial pressures were adjusted to 350 ppmV, 2200 ppmV and 8700 ppmV respectively, covering the range of Phanerozoic atmospheric CO 2 partial pressures inferred from palaeosoils, <b>stomatal</b> <b>indices</b> and model calculations. Microsensor measurements of calcium, pH and oxygen revealed differences in the potential to precipitate CaCO 3 between the two model organisms Tychonema-relative strain SAG 2388 and Synechococcus sp. strain SAG 2387. Whereas a strong removal of Ca 2 + from the solution was measured at Tychonema-relative biofilm, the Synechococcus sp. biofilm exercised a much lower Ca 2 + removal during photosynthesis. Photosynthesis was enhanced in both organisms with increasing CO 2 and HCO 3 −, as indicated by enhanced O 2 production, but only for the motile filamentous taxon Tychonema-relative a concomitantly increasing calcium removal was measured. However, model calculations indicate that this short-term Ca 2 + binding in the Tychonema-relative is due to complexation to exopolymers or oscillin, with no immediate CaCO 3 precipitation. In contrast, Ca 2 + and pH measurements at Synechococcus sp. biofilm could be consistent with immediate CaCO 3 precipitation at the cells. In both biofilms, pH gradients increase with increasing pCO 2 from 350 to 2200 ppmV due to enhanced photosynthesis, but decrease at a pCO 2 of 8700 ppmV despite of further enhanced photosynthesis. This observation, regardless whether CO 2 or HCO 3 − is used by the cyanobacteria, is in accordance with hydrochemical modeling demonstrating an increased DIC buffering at high pCO 2 conditions. These results indicate that the potential of cyanobacteria to form spatially defined calcification pattern via pH gradients at their cell envelopes ('calcified cyanobacteria') increases at elevated pCO 2, while at high pCO 2 conditions Ca 2 + binding and lowered pH microgradients lead to spatially diffuse calcification without defined cell envelope precipitates...|$|R

40|$|Casearia sylvestris Swartz (Salicaceae) {{has been}} used in {{traditional}} medicine and its leaf extracts have been exhibited important pharmacological activities. The species presents morphological, chemical and genetic variation. Two varieties are considered due external morphological differences: C. sylvestris var. sylvestris and var. lingua. There are difficulties in definition of these varieties. The objective of this work is to evaluate chemical and morpho-anatomical differences between C. sylvestris varieties that can be applied in their distinction for pharmaceutical or botanical purposes. Transverse and paradermic sections of leaves were prepared for morpho-anatomical, histochemical and quantitative microscopy (<b>stomatal</b> and palisade <b>index)</b> analyses. Diterpene profiles of the specimens were obtained by HPLC-DAD and TLC. Morpho-anatomical analyses demonstrated significant differences between the varieties only in paradermic sections: var. sylvestris - polygonal epidermic cell walls and hypostomatic; var. lingua - rounded epidermic cell walls and amphistomatic. No differences were observed for <b>stomatal</b> index; palisade <b>index</b> was found 2. 8 for var. lingua and 3. 9 for var. sylvestris. Chromatographic analyses confirmed previous results demonstrating that diterpene profile in varieties differs, with predominance of these metabolites in var. sylvestris. In conclusion, this work indicates that chromatographic analysis besides morpho-anatomical analysis can be applied in distinction of C. sylvestris varieties...|$|R
