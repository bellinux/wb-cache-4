A <b>school</b> <b>bag</b> is becoming a fashion accessory. Pupils' wishes are bigger every year: they want a new bag, with a different pattern, different colour or even a different shape. But not all the parents can afford buying a new <b>school</b> <b>bag</b> every year. In this case, charity is a good option. According to advanced technology, we can expect pupil's books, workbooks, notebooks and school supplies to be replaced by iPod sand e-books in the near future.

I also described history of a schoolbag, it's shape and creation. I also wrote how a <b>school</b> <b>bag</b> is recommended to be in order to be pupil-friendly. It is also described here in after the newest shapes and styles of a schoolbag. I also took a glimpse in research of <b>school</b> <b>bag</b> colours – is it important to have a certain colour whether one is a boy or a girl.

40|$|There {{are more}} {{researches}} which {{deal with the}} ratio between body weight and <b>school</b> <b>bag</b> which in most cases on all continents overpasses the weight of 10 % of pupils’ total weight, which indicates that recommendations of World Health Organization are not followed. World Health Organization proposed that maximal weight which could be carried by children should not be higher than 10 % of their body weight. The weight of a <b>school</b> <b>bag</b> that children carry {{to school every day}} is from 4. 0 to 7. 7 kilos in different researches (Casey & Dockrell, 1996; Pascoe et al.; Grimmer et al., 1999).

The goal of this research was to study the relations between pupils’ body weight and <b>school</b> <b>bag</b> weight and {{on the basis of the}} results to give recommendation for praxis. The results for younger and older pupils are similar to the results of other researches in the world.

40|$|Background: Recurrent {{non-specific}} {{low back}} pain (NSLBP) is increasingly becoming common among adolescents worldwide. A recent study in Zimbabwe showed a relatively high prevalence (28. 8 %) among high school students. Influential associated factors, however, remain unclear. This is a significant shortcoming. The aim was to determine personal or lifestyle-related factors associated with recurrent NSLBP among high school adolescents in Harare, Zimbabwe. Methods: This study {{was part of a}} large epidemiological study conducted in two continuous parts. Part one sought to determine self-reported associated factors among 532 participants (mean age = 16 ± 1. 72 years) drawn randomly from selected government schools using a reliable and content-validated questionnaire (Kappa coefficient, k = 0. 32 – 1). Part two purposively identified adolescents (N = 64, median age = 17 years, interquartile range, IQR = 15 – 18 years) with a history of ‘severe’ recurrent NSLBP from part one based on a specific eligibility criteria and compared body mass index, relative <b>school</b> <b>bag</b> weight and hamstring flexibility with matched adolescents without NSLBP. Data was analysed using Statistica version 11. Independent t-tests or χ 2 tests of association were used for continuous and categorical data, respectively. The statistical significance was set at p <. 05. Results: Recurrent NSLBP was associated with self-reported factors such as perceptions of a heavy <b>school</b> <b>bag</b> [χ 2 (1) = 85. 9, p < 0. 001]. A significant proportion of adolescents with recurrent NSLBP spent over 30 min carrying the <b>school</b> <b>bag</b> to and from school [χ 2 (1) = 32. 2, p < 0. 001]. It was also associated with prolonged sitting (p < 0. 001), not playing sports [χ 2 (1) = 5. 85, p = 0. 02] and tight hamstrings [χ 2 (1) = 7. 6, p = 0. 006]. Conclusions: Although conclusions from this study are hesitant because of the cross-sectional nature of the study and the relatively small sample size in follow-up study, recurrent NSLBP is associated with perceptions of a heavy <b>school</b> <b>bag,</b> duration of <b>school</b> <b>bag</b> carriage, no sports participation, prolonged sitting on entertainment activities, and tight hamstrings. These findings add to the importance of promoting physical activity at school or home especially aimed at improving muscle flexibility...|$|R

After the experiment, the pupils and their guardians filled out the same multiple-choice questionnaire separately. The interview transcripts were analysed using NVivo 9 and the questionnaire data were analysed using SPSS.|$|R
