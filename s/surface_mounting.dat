40|$|We {{present a}} basic {{tutorial}} for implementing <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> technology in lab-built scientific instruments. We discuss {{the advantages and}} disadvantages of using <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> chips. We also describe methods for the development and prototyping of <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> circuitry in home-built electronics. The method of soldering <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> components in a common toaster oven is described. We provide advice from our own experience in developing this technology, and argue that <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> technology is often preferable to using leaded components when building large circuits, and is essential if the desired component characteristics are only available in <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> packages.

50|$|Surface-mounted {{door closers}} come in four variations: slide-track arm, regular arm <b>surface</b> <b>mounted,</b> {{parallel}} arm <b>surface</b> <b>mounted,</b> and top jamb mounted. Overhead door closers are typically <b>surface</b> <b>mounted,</b> some manufacturers offer concealed models too. Such closers mount inside a pocket {{in the door}} frame or are mounted in the floor directly under the pivot point and are completely concealed.|$|R

2500|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>mounting</b> {{lends itself}} well {{to a high}} degree of automation, {{reducing}} labor costs and greatly increasing production rates. [...] Components can be supplied mounted on carrier tapes. Surface mount components can be about one-quarter to one-tenth of the size and weight of through-hole components, and passive components much cheaper; prices of semiconductor surface mount devices (SMDs) are determined more by the chip itself than the package, with little price advantage over larger packages. Some wire-ended components, such as 1N4148 small-signal switch diodes, are actually significantly cheaper than SMD equivalents.|$|E
2500|$|The wing {{contained}} metal {{framed and}} skinned ailerons, but the flaps {{were made of}} wood and were hydraulically controlled. The nacelles were mostly wood, although, for strength, the engine mounts were all metal as were the undercarriage parts. Engine mounts of welded steel tube were added, along with simple landing gear oleos filled with rubber blocks. Wood was used to carry only in-plane loads, with metal fittings used for all triaxially loaded components such as landing gear, engine mounts, control <b>surface</b> <b>mounting</b> brackets, and the wing-to-fuselage junction. The outer leading wing edge had to be brought [...] further forward to accommodate this design. The main tail unit was all wood built. The control surfaces, the rudder and elevator, were aluminium framed and fabric covered. The total weight of metal castings and forgings used in the aircraft was only [...]|$|E
50|$|Surface: Flanges {{extending}} outwards {{from the}} base of the bike rack are secured into existing concrete with lag bolts. For added support, <b>surface</b> <b>mounts</b> can also include triangular brackets, also referred to as gusset plates, to reinforce the connection between the flange and tubing. <b>Surface</b> <b>mounts</b> with this extra support are called gusset <b>mounts.</b> <b>Surface</b> and gusset <b>mounts</b> are used to secure a bike rack into an existing piece of concrete.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> {{package is}} favored where {{a low profile}} package is {{required}} or the space available to mount the package is limited. As electronic devices become more complex and available space is reduced, the desirability of a <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> package increases. Concurrently, as the device complexity increases, the heat generated by operation increases. If the heat is not removed, {{the temperature of the}} device rises shortening the operational life. It is therefore highly desirable to develop <b>surface</b> <b>mount</b> packages having high thermal conductivity.|$|R
