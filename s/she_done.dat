5|$|The {{music video}} {{features}} Madonna in different styles and fashions. It also includes her dripping in twenty million {{dollars worth of}} vintage jewels and gowns in several transformations, including an original 25carat ring and bracelet that was worn by West in the 1933 film, <b>She</b> <b>Done</b> Him Wrong. A real doctor (Dr. David Kish) was hired by Madonna to administer the fake shots, since {{she wanted to make}} the scenes appear real. The first day of shooting took place on June 2, 2003, and the scenes shot included the wall-of-mirrors, the massage, the botox injection and the ballet dancing sequences. The next day started with the French maid, the motel TV, the telephone conversation and the glamour shot scenes. Henry Keazor, {{one of the authors of}} Rewind, Play, Fast Forward: The Past, Present and Future of the Music Video, noted that Madonna exposed herself during the interventions portrayed in the video, by playing with the rumors and the stereotypes surrounding her.|$|E
500|$|In 1933, Grant gained {{attention}} for {{appearing in the}} pre-Code films <b>She</b> <b>Done</b> Him Wrong [...] and I'm No Angel opposite Mae West. West would later claim that she had discovered Cary Grant. Pauline Kael noted that Grant did not appear confident {{in his role as}} a Salvation Army director in <b>She</b> <b>Done</b> Him Wrong, which made it all the more charming. The film was a box office hit, earning more than $2 million in the United States, and has since won much acclaim. For I'm No Angel, Grant's salary was increased from $450 to $750 a week. The film was even more successful than <b>She</b> <b>Done</b> Him Wrong, and saved Paramount from bankruptcy; Vermilye cites it {{as one of the best}} comedy films of the 1930s.|$|E
500|$|Born in Horfield, Bristol, Grant became {{attracted}} to theatre {{at a young}} age, and began performing with a troupe known as [...] "The Penders" [...] {{from the age of}} six. After attending Bishop Road Primary School and Fairfield Grammar School in Bristol, he toured the country as a stage performer, and decided to stay in New York City after a performance there. He established a name for himself in vaudeville in the 1920s and toured the United States before moving to Hollywood in the early 1930s. He initially appeared in crime films or dramas such as Blonde Venus (1932) and <b>She</b> <b>Done</b> Him Wrong (1933), but later gained renown for his appearances in romantic comedy and screwball comedy films such as The Awful Truth (1937), Bringing Up Baby (1938), His Girl Friday (1940) and The Philadelphia Story (1940). Along with the later Arsenic and Old Lace (1944) and I Was a Male War Bride (1949); these films are frequently cited as among the all-time great comedy films. Having established himself as a major Hollywood star, he was nominated twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for Penny Serenade (1941) and None but the Lonely Heart (1944).|$|E

500|$|Mae West {{had already}} {{established}} {{herself as a}} comedic performer when her 1926 Broadway show Sex made national headlines. Tried and convicted of indecency by the New York City District Attorney, she served eight days in prison. West carefully constructed a stage persona and carried it over into her interviews and personal appearances. Despite her voluptuous physique, most of her appeal lay in her suggestive manner. She became a wordsmith {{in the art of}} the come-on and the seductive line, and despite her obvious appeal to male audiences, was popular with women as well. Over the cries of the censors, West got her start in the film Night After Night (1932), which starred George Raft and Constance Cummings, as a Texas Guinan-esque supporting character. She agreed to appear in the film only after producers agreed to let her write her own lines. In West's first line on film, after a hat check girl remarks [...] "Goodness, what beautiful diamonds", West replies, [...] "Goodness {{had nothing to do with}} it, dearie." [...] Raft, who had wanted Texas Guinan herself for the role that went to West, later wrote, [...] "In this picture, Mae West stole everything but the cameras." [...] She went on to make <b>She</b> <b>Done</b> Him Wrong in 1933, which became a huge box office hit, grossing $3 million against a $200,000 budget, and then nine months later wrote and starred in I'm No Angel. She became such a success that her career saved Paramount from financial ruin.|$|E
2500|$|In series 2, Ullman {{portrays a}} very bitter Germaine Greer. Greer, who {{in recent years}} has come under fire for her {{controversial}} transgender views, complains about being silenced by the media to anyone who will listen in the series. [...] "I think Germaine Greer has become intellectually homeless, so I play her at a bus stop looking homeless. [...] she was this great sex symbol and she likes to talk about s****ing Martin Amis in the 60s, but what's <b>she</b> <b>done</b> recently? She's constantly blaming old age: 'You try being old! It's the biggest sin of all.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{brought her}} Diamond Lil character, now renamed [...] "Lady Lou", {{to the screen}} in <b>She</b> <b>Done</b> Him Wrong (1933). The film is also notable as one of Cary Grant's first major roles, which boosted his career. West claimed she spotted Grant at the studio and insisted that he be cast as the male lead. She claimed to have told a Paramount {{director}} [...] "If he can talk, I'll take him!" [...] The film was a box-office hit and earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. The success of the film saved Paramount from bankruptcy, grossing over $2 million, the equivalent of $140 million in today's dollars. Paramount recognizes that debt of gratitude today, with a building on the lot named after her.|$|E

2500|$|It {{also found}} that the lookout being kept was {{inadequate}} given the navigational hazards Titanic faced, and that the ship's officers had been complacent. There were too few lifeboats available and they had not been properly filled or manned with trained seamen, though they had been lowered correctly. The inquiry concluded that Californian [...] "could have pushed through the ice to the open water without any serious risk and so have come to the assistance of the Titanic. Had <b>she</b> <b>done</b> so she might have saved many if not all of the lives that were lost." [...] The Board of Trade's representative suggested to Lord Mersey that a formal inquiry should be held into Captain Lord's [...] "competency to continue as Master of a British ship" [...] but no action was taken against him due to legal technicalities. The Board of Trade was criticised for its inadequate regulations, notably the failure to ensure that enough lifeboats were provided and that crews were given proper training in their use. The Duff Gordons were cleared of wrongdoing but it was made clear that they should have acted more tactfully.|$|E
2500|$|Shevchenko {{was arrested}} {{along with other}} members of the society on April 5, 1847. Tsar Nicholas read Shevchenko's poem, [...] "Dream". Vissarion Belinsky wrote in his memoirs that, Nicholas I, knowing Ukrainian very well, laughed and chuckled whilst reading the section about himself, but his mood quickly turned to bitter hatred when he read about his wife. Shevchenko had mocked her frumpy {{appearance}} and facial tics, which she had developed fearing the Decembrist Uprising and its plans to kill her family. After reading this section the Tsar indignantly stated [...] "I suppose he had reasons not to be on terms with me, but what has <b>she</b> <b>done</b> to deserve this?" [...] In the official report of Orlov Shevchenko was accused in using [...] "Little-Russian language" [...] (archaic Russian name for Ukrainian language) of outrageous content instead of being grateful to be redeemed out of serfdom. In the report Orlov claimed that Shevchenko was expressing a cry over alleged enslavement and disaster of Ukraine, glorified the Hetman Administration (Cossack Hetmanate) and Cossack liberties and [...] "with incredible audacity poured slander and bile on persons of Imperial House".|$|E
2500|$|Mae West was {{a shrewd}} investor, {{produced}} her own stage acts, and invested her money in {{large tracts of}} land in Van Nuys, a thriving suburb of Los Angeles. With her considerable fortune, she could afford to do as she liked. [...] In 1976, she appeared on Back Lot U.S.A. on CBS, where she was interviewed by Dick Cavett and sang [...] "Frankie and Johnny" [...] along with [...] "After You've Gone." [...] That same year, she began work on her final film, Sextette (1978). Adapted from a 1959 script written by West, the film's daily revisions and production disagreements hampered production from the beginning. Due to the near-endless last-minute script changes and tiring production schedule, West agreed to have her lines signaled to her through a speaker concealed in her hair piece. Despite the daily problems, West was, according to Sextette director Ken Hughes, determined to see the film through. [...] At 86, her now-failing eyesight made navigating around the set difficult, but she {{made it through the}} filming, a tribute to her self-confidence, [...] remarkable endurance, and stature as a self-created star 67 years after her Broadway debut in 1911 at the age of 18. Time wrote an article on the indomitable star entitled [...] "At 84, Mae West Is Still Mae West." [...] Upon its release, Sextette was not a critical or commercial success, but remains notable for the diverse cast, and because none of West's contemporaries such as Dietrich, Garbo, etc., were still making films. [...] The cast included some of West's first co-stars such George Raft (Night After Night, 1932), silver screen stars such as Walter Pigeon and Tony Curtis, and more contemporary pop stars such as The Beatles' Ringo Starr and Alice Cooper, and television favorites such as Dom DeLuise and gossip queen Rona Barrett. [...] It also included cameos of some of her famed musclemen from her 1950s Las Vegas show, such as the still remarkably fit Reg Lewis. [...] Sextette also reunited Mae West with Edith Head, her costume designer from 1933 in <b>She</b> <b>Done</b> Him Wrong. [...] The film was a last hurrah and a Valentine from Mae West to her fans.|$|E
