40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Wildlife, 2014 Fire is {{a dynamic}} {{ecosystem}} process in mixed-conifer forests of the Sierra Nevada, however there is limited scientific information addressing wildlife habitat use in burned landscapes. Recent studies suggest stand-replacing wildfires may be {{a major source of}} habitat loss for <b>spotted</b> <b>owls</b> (Strix occidentalis). While fire promotes heterogeneous forest patches, high severity fire may create large canopy gaps that can fragment closed-canopy habitat preferred by <b>spotted</b> <b>owls.</b> Large areas of high severity fire may eliminate protective cover or perch sites for <b>spotted</b> <b>owls,</b> while unburned or low to moderate severity fire containing intact forest canopy may provide protective cover or high prey availability. I used radio telemetry to determine whether foraging California <b>spotted</b> <b>owls</b> in Yosemite National Park showed selection for particular types of fire severity. My results suggest that <b>spotted</b> <b>owls</b> exhibited habitat selection for lower fire severities, edge sites, and locations near the roost within their home range. Although owls selected high contrast edges with greater relative probabilities than low contrast edges, I did not detect a statistical difference in these edge types. Protecting the remaining forests from stand-replacing fires via mechanical thinning or prescribed fire is a priority for management agencies, and my results suggest that fires of low to moderate severity can create habitat conditions suitable for California <b>spotted</b> <b>owls...</b>|$|R

In contrast, Jones et al. (2016) {{concluded that}} high-severity wildfire negatively impacted owls and that megafires posed a threat to <b>spotted</b> <b>owls</b> because occupancy probability for <b>spotted</b> <b>owls</b> declined by 22 % the year after the King Fire and declined by almost nine-fold in sites that burned at > 50 % high severity.|$|R

5|$|The Forest Service {{and other}} {{scientists}} are currently studying the biological effects from the fire. There were 45 California <b>spotted</b> <b>owl</b> breeding sites within the Rim Fire perimeter on Forest Service land, and one year post-fire they had the highest-ever recorded occupancy rate for California spotted owls. <b>Spotted</b> <b>owl</b> sites with 100% high-severity burn were occupied by pairs {{at the same rate}} as unburned sites. The Rim Fire contains many populations of rare California endemic flowers such as Clarkia australis and Clarkia biloba ssp. australis in places where plantation trees burned; these areas, however, are to be disturbed by planned thinning. Researchers estimate that the Rim Fire burned nearly one-fifth of known great gray owl nesting sites, but post-fire surveys found no significant difference in owl detection at burned versus unburned sites. A study of how pre-fire forest conditions affected fire severity found that weather, time since the last fire, and shrub cover had strong positive associations with fire severity, and that under extreme weather conditions, as is often the case with fires that escape initial attack, large areas of high-severity fire are created even in fuels-reduced forests with restored fire regimes.|$|E
5|$|Along much of Yosemite's western boundary, {{habitats}} {{are dominated}} by mixed coniferous forests of ponderosa pine, sugar pine, incense cedar, white fir, Douglas fir, and a few stands of giant sequoia, interspersed by areas of black oak and canyon live oak. A relatively high diversity of wildlife species is supported by these habitats, because of relatively mild, lower-elevation climate and the mixture of habitat types and plant species. Wildlife species typically found in these habitats include black bear, coyote, raccoon, mountain kingsnake, Gilbert's skink, white-headed woodpecker, bobcat, river otter, gray fox, red fox, brown creeper, two species of skunk, cougar, <b>spotted</b> <b>owl,</b> and {{a wide variety of}} bat species.|$|E

In 1994, the federal Northwest Forest Plan was implemented.

40|$|AbstractAvian trichomonosis, {{caused by}} the flagellated {{protozoan}} parasite Trichomonas gallinae, has variable pathogenicity among bird species ranging from asymptomatic infections to severe disease periodically manifesting in epidemic mortality. Traditionally, columbids are identified as highly susceptible to infection with occasional spillover into raptors that prey on infected birds. We identified avian trichomonosis in two dead California <b>spotted</b> <b>owls</b> (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) and three dead northern <b>spotted</b> <b>owls</b> (S.  o. caurina) in California during 2011 – 2015; infection was confirmed in four owls by PCR. Pathologic lesions associated with trichomonosis in the owls included caseonecrotic lesions of the upper palate accompanied by oropharyngitis, cellulitis, myositis, and/or sinusitis. <b>Spotted</b> <b>owls</b> are known to mainly feed on small mammals; therefore, the source of infection {{as well as the}} significance of the disease in <b>spotted</b> <b>owls</b> is unclear. These owl trichomonosis cases coincided temporally and spatially with three trichomonosis epidemics in band-tailed pigeons (Patagioenas fasciata monilis). The same parasite, T.  gallinae subtype A 2, was isolated from the <b>spotted</b> <b>owls</b> and band-tailed pigeons, suggesting the owls became infected when opportunistically feeding on pigeons during mortality events. Avian trichomonosis {{is an important factor in}} the decline of the Pacific Coast band-tailed pigeon population with near-annual mortality events during the last 10 years and could have conservation implications for raptor species at risk, particularly those that are facing multiple threats...|$|R
5|$|More than 250 {{wildlife}} species, including peregrine falcon, {{bald eagle}} and northern <b>spotted</b> <b>owl</b> {{are thought to}} frequent the watershed. Migratory birds such as loons use the basin for feeding and nesting as they travel along the Pacific Flyway. Native fish species include chinook and coho salmon, steelhead, coastal cutthroat trout, Pacific lamprey, and rainbow trout, but since 1922 the headworks dam or its successor, Dam 2, have blocked anadromous fish passage to the upper river and its tributaries. Many amphibian and reptile species thrive near streams and ponds.

3000|$|<b>Spotted</b> <b>owls</b> {{are known}} to forage in burned areas, {{including}} severely burned areas.
