30|$|Generally, {{when the}} contact angle is smaller than 90 °, the solid <b>surface</b> <b>is</b> {{considered}} to be ‘lyophilic’ which means wetting of liquid on the <b>surface</b> <b>is</b> favorable.

50|$|In {{classical}} geometry, a <b>surface</b> <b>is</b> generally {{defined as}} a locus of a point or a line.

5|$|Chrysippus also {{responded to}} a problem first posed by Democritus. If a cone is divided by a plane {{parallel}} to its base, are the surfaces of the segments equal or unequal? If they are equal, then the cone becomes a cylinder; if they are unequal, then {{the surface of the}} cone must be stepped. The reply of Chrysippus was that the <b>surfaces</b> <b>are</b> both equal and unequal. Chrysippus was, in effect, negating the law of excluded middle with respect to the equal and unequal, and thus he may have anticipated an important principle of modern infinitesimal calculus, namely, the limit and the process of convergence towards a limit.|$|E
5|$|For surfaces, the {{generalization}} from {{the geometry of}} a plane –a flat surface– {{to that of a}} general curved surface had been described in the early 19th century by Carl Friedrich Gauss. This description had in turn been generalized to higher-dimensional spaces in a mathematical formalism introduced by Bernhard Riemann in the 1850s. With the help of Riemannian geometry, Einstein formulated a geometric description of gravity in which Minkowski's spacetime is replaced by distorted, curved spacetime, just as curved <b>surfaces</b> <b>are</b> a generalization of ordinary plane surfaces. Embedding Diagrams are used to illustrate curved spacetime in educational contexts.|$|E
