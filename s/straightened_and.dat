5|$|Woolly mammoth ivory {{was used}} to create art objects. Several Venus figurines, {{including}} the Venus of Brassempouy and the Venus of Lespugue, were made from this material. Weapons made from ivory, such as daggers, spears, and a boomerang, are also known. To be able to process the ivory, the large tusks had to be chopped, chiselled and split into smaller, more manageable pieces. Some ivory artefacts show that tusks had been <b>straightened,</b> <b>and</b> it is unknown how this was achieved.|$|E
5|$|Between 1774 and 1797 {{a series}} of {{enclosures}} {{took place in the}} Brue valley between the Poldens and Wedmore. In 1794 the annual floods filled the whole of the Brue valley. Work by the Commissioners of Sewers led to the 1801 Brue Drainage Act which enabled sections at Highbridge and Cripp's Bridge to be <b>straightened,</b> <b>and</b> new feeder channels such as the North and South Drains to be constructed. In 1803 the clyse at Highbridge, which had been built before 1485, was replaced and moved further downstream.|$|E

5|$|The Bridgwater and Taunton Canal {{opened in}} 1827, which {{provided}} an easier route than the river, and protracted legal battles followed over {{ownership of the}} river and water rights for the canal. These were not finally resolved until 1832, when the Canal Company formally took over the river navigation. The ability to navigate the river gradually deteriorated, not helped by the abandonment of the River Parrett as a navigation in 1878. Following flooding in Taunton in 1960, much of the river between there and its mouth was <b>straightened,</b> <b>and</b> the navigation locks were removed. That at Ham was blown up by the Territorial Army. Navigation rights were repealed in 1967.|$|E
5|$|The Michigan State Highway Department rerouted M-33/M-72 near Fairview in late 1951 {{or early}} 1952, turning the former route back to local control. In {{the middle of}} 1953, the section of M-65/M-72 in Alcona County was <b>straightened</b> <b>and</b> paved. All but the western three miles (4.8km) of the earthen highway section opened in 1940 were paved in 1957. By the middle of 1961, the highway would be paved in its entirety. A new section of highway was opened in 1973, {{rerouting}} M-66 and M-72 due west from their junction to US131, bypassing a former routing north into Kalkaska.|$|E
5|$|The Yellowhead {{began as}} the Yellowhead Red River cart trail. When the {{province}} was surveyed, the road {{evolved from a}} dirt to gravel to all-weather road known as Provincial Highway 5 from the Alberta–Saskatchewan boundary to Saskatoon, and as Provincial Highway 14 from Saskatoon to the Manitoba–Saskatchewan boundary. In the late 1950s and 1960s, the highway was <b>straightened</b> <b>and</b> widened. On August 15, 1970 the Yellowhead was opened for the northern Trans-Canada route. The highway was completely designated for the entire route as Saskatchewan Highway 16 in 1976.|$|E

5|$|When the Glynneath bypass {{was built}} in the 1970s, the canal was culverted above Ysgwrfa lock, to allow the road to be <b>straightened,</b> <b>and</b> reduced in width beyond that, to allow the road to be widened. Above Pentremalwed lock, the road was built over the canal bed, and all traces have gone. This road was {{superseded}} by the A465 dual carriageway when it opened in 1996, and has become the B4242 road. The part which covered the final section of the canal is no longer a road, although the dual carriageway runs over the site of the Glynneath basin.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers widened, <b>straightened,</b> <b>and</b> deepened the canal. As part {{of their}} work, the agency {{constructed}} a vertical lift bridge across the canal. Between 1924 and 1926, the Maryland State Roads Commission constructed approaches to the new bridge {{on both sides of}} the expanded canal, eliminating two narrow and dangerous bridges and four right-angle turns in Chesapeake City. The new route along George Street and Lock Street, which became part of US 213 in 1927 and is now MD 285 and MD 537, entirely bypassed what is now MD 284. After the tanker Franz Klasen destroyed the vertical lift bridge on July 28, 1942, the Maryland State Roads Commission established a ferry service across the canal. Between 1946 and 1949, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed the present tied arch Chesapeake City Bridge and new approach roads to the bridge.|$|E

5|$|Jones's {{recommendations}} were immediately accepted {{and put into}} practice. A series of new batteries aligned on a roughly north-south axis facing west towards the harbour was constructed, including Jones', Civil Hospital, Raglan's, Gardiner's, Queen Victoria's, Lady Augusta's, Prince of Wales and Cumberland batteries. Further batteries and fortifications were constructed around Rosia Bay near {{the south of the}} peninsula and Windmill Hill was strengthened around its entire perimeter, with Retrenched Barracks at its north end blocking access to the higher ground behind. The sea wall in the town was <b>straightened</b> <b>and</b> strengthened with the building of two new curtain walls, Prince Albert's Front and Wellington Front. Defensive breakwaters were constructed in front of both to prevent an armoured enemy ship ramming the walls.|$|E
5|$|Navigation {{was further}} {{affected}} by {{the passing of the}} Somersetshire Drainage Act on 1 July 1878, which resulted in the River Parrett being taken over by the Drainage Commissioners, and abandoned as a navigation. Limited traffic continued to use the lower reaches of the Tone, with the last barge using the Burrowbridge to Ham Mills section in 1929. In 1967 the Somerset River Authority applied to the Ministry of Agriculture for permission to remove the navigation rights, and the original acts of parliament were repealed under section 41 of the Land Drainage Act (1930). This allowed the river through Taunton to be <b>straightened,</b> <b>and</b> a weir to be constructed at Firepool, to improve the flood defences for Taunton. Above the weir, the river is still navigable as far as French Weir.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the month}} of July, the Autodromo Nazionale Monza race track's main {{straight}} was <b>straightened</b> <b>and</b> the Variante Goodyear and Seconda Variante chicanes were reconfigured by the race organisers to become a series of narrower corners with the exit away from the entry of turn one. The run-off areas around the two sections of the circuit were enlargened. Some of the drivers, however, were unhappy with the modifications, though, as there were fears of a multi-car accident on the first lap. Coulthard claimed that the new corner would make braking more difficult and was concerned over the amount of penalties issued to other competitors. However, Michael Schumacher believed his and other teams would be less concerned with suspension damage. Jean Alesi {{who was the first}} driver to test the new circuit, said that it would be easier for drivers to pull off the track {{in the event of a}} technical issue.|$|E

5|$|The first {{segments}} of road {{appeared in the}} location of what would become RE11 by 1940. The southern road segment began at an at-grade intersection, near the location of RE11, and traveled northward, before traveling slightly westward and terminating at a dead end. The road was graded and drained, and had a gravel surface, with a cattle guard near the middle of it. The northern segment of road traveled near the location of RE11. This road was also graded and drained, and had three cattle guards located along its course. By 1951, a gate had {{been added to the}} southern road segment, and the northern segment had several turns <b>straightened</b> <b>and</b> lengthened. On October 28, 1953, RM 2134 was designated from Millersview along a road to the northern segment of what would become RE11. On August 24, 1955, the highway was designated along the northern segment of road, to the Colorado River. The designation was made official on October 1, 1955.|$|E
5|$|The first {{segments}} of {{road in the}} location of what would become FM 1528 existed by the year of 1936. On September 26, 1939, a portion of road traveling from SH 24 to the community of Klondike was designated as Spur Highway 39 (Spur 39). and on September 28, 1949, through {{the order of the}} Texas Transportation Board, FM 1528 was designated, and Spur 39 was redesignated as part of the highway. In 1961, the highway had a bituminous surface, a combination of gravel and asphalt. By 1987, the highway had been minorly rerouted and <b>straightened,</b> <b>and</b> the entire length had been paved. Between 1986 and 1991, the highway's route was minorly rerouted between Klondike and Cooper, due to the construction of Cooper Lake.|$|E
5|$|In late 1944, Monroe met {{photographer}} David Conover, who {{had been}} sent by the U.S. Army Air Forces' First Motion Picture Unit (FMPU) to the factory to shoot morale-boosting pictures of female workers. Although none of her pictures were used by the FMPU, she quit working at the factory in January 1945 and began modeling for Conover and his friends. She moved out of her in-laws' home, defying them and her husband, and {{signed a contract with}} the Blue Book Model Agency in August 1945. She began to occasionally use the name Jean Norman when working, and had her curly brunette hair <b>straightened</b> <b>and</b> dyed blonde to make her more employable. Her figure was deemed more suitable for pin-up than fashion modeling, and she was featured mostly in advertisements and men's magazines. According to the agency's owner, Emmeline Snively, Monroe was one of its most ambitious and hard-working models; by early 1946, she had appeared on 33 magazine covers for publications such as Pageant, U.S. Camera, Laff, and Peek.|$|E

5|$|The River Parrett, the Bristol Channel and the Severn Estuary are {{believed}} to have been used for riverine bulk transportation of people and supplies in Somerset under Roman and later Anglo-Saxon and Norman occupation. Roman Somerset, which lasted for over 250years until around the beginning of the 5th century, had various settlements, including Bath (Aquae Sulis), Ilchester (Lindinis) and lead mines at Charterhouse; and four roads surrounding the Somerset Levels. There is evidence of two Roman ports on the Parrett. The port at Combwich, on the west bank, was ill-recorded before its destruction by quarrying and erosion. The other at Crandon Bridge on the east bank near where the current King's Sedgemoor Drain enters the Parrett, was in use between the first and the fourth centuries. Evidence of an extensive site with storehouses was found in the mid-1970s, during motorway construction works. The Crandon Bridge site may have been linked by a probable Roman road over the Polden Hills to the Fosse Way, at Ilchester. Ilchester, the largest Roman town in Somerset, was a port with large granaries, sited where the Fosse Way crossed the Ilchester Yeo by means of a paved ford. The Yeo was navigable by small craft {{all the way to the}} Parrett allowing military supplies to be brought by boat directly to Ilchester; however, disembarkation at Crandon Bridge and use of the Polden Hills roadway allowed more rapid movement to Ilchester. The Yeo may already have been <b>straightened</b> <b>and</b> canalised before Roman occupation.|$|E
5|$|The rivers {{were run}} {{down by the}} 1920s and, with high {{unemployment}} in the area, West Ham Corporation and the Lee Conservancy Board applied for a government unemployment relief grant, with which to fund major improvements. In addition {{to work on the}} channels, Bow Tidal Lock was duplicated, Marshgate Lock was rebuilt further east as City Mill Lock, and a second new lock at Carpenters Road was constructed. It used up-and-over radial gates operated by winches, rather than the traditional mitre gates used at City Mill Lock. The gates were quadrant-shaped, and were raised out of the river to allow boats to enter or leave the lock. An Act of Parliament was obtained in 1930 to authorise the work, called the River Lee (Flood Relief) Act, and work began the following year. The project was completed in 1935. Before the work, there had been a floodgate on the Waterworks River above its junction with the Three Mills Wall River, and a large pool, the City Mill Pool, connecting to the City Mills River and Saint Thomas Creek. Marshgate Lock was situated {{to the west of the}} junction between the Pudding Mill River and Saint Thomas Creek. It was originally built in 1864, by adding a second set of gates to Hunters Gates, a floodgate which had been built around 1847. The reconstructed lock was built on the site of the City Mill Pool, and had two sets of gates at its eastern end, to prevent high tidal levels in Waterworks River flooding the waterways to the west. It was labelled Marshgate Lane Lock on the 1948 map, but was called Ward Lock, after a local councillor, and is now known as City Mills Lock. The course of the Saint Thomas Creek was then <b>straightened,</b> <b>and</b> the original Marshgate Lock was bypassed. Pudding Mill River became a dead end when the lower section was filled in, as was most of the Three Mills Back River, and the floodgate on Waterworks River was also removed. Reconstruction of the channels included widening City Mill River to , while Three Mills Wall River and Waterworks River were made twice that width.|$|E

Secondly, a new approach is proposed to temper <b>and</b> <b>straighten</b> the strip steel based on the temper leveling mill, shortly, TLM. The required high quality of the wave, surface and mechanical properties can be achieved only with TLM. TLM holds the functions of both temper machine <b>and</b> <b>straightening</b> mill <b>and</b> can produce good quality strip steel, no only the waviness, mechanical properties, but also the surface quality. The usage of TLM can lower the cost of the production of tempering, <b>straightening</b> <b>and</b> equipment investment. Finally, the experiments are done and verify the validity of the approach...|$|R
