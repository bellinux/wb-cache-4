25|$|The Sperrin was {{equipped}} with a tricycle undercarriage arrangement (a twin-wheel nosewheel {{and a pair of}} four-wheel bogies), in which the nose gear would retract backward and the main gear into the wings towards the fuselage. A <b>safety</b> <b>circuit</b> was present to prevent retraction of the landing gear until a sufficient air speed had been attained. Unusually, the landing gear was steerable, the Sperrin being one of the first British aircraft to be fitted with this feature; operation of the landing gear, along with various other pieces of onboard equipment, was achieved via the onboard Messier hydraulic system. A 24/28-volt DC electrical network was present to power onboard equipment; both of the electrical generators as well as the air pressure of the cabin was maintained by a supercharger driven by two accessory gearboxes that were housed within the wings.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>safety</b> <b>circuit</b> {{determines that}} a pack {{has been used}} when its voltage falls below a threshold, or if it detects a minimum number of pulses. Testing a pack is not {{normally}} sufficient to cause it to become [...] "used", but normal operation should make it [...] "used" [...] around the time 1% of its capacity has been depleted. The <b>safety</b> <b>circuit</b> causes the pack to become [...] "depleted" [...] when it falls below its end-of-life voltage and turns off. A used pack will continue to function normally, but a depleted pack {{can no longer be}} used.|$|E

30|$|One of {{the issues}} of LiCoO 2 is {{instability}} of its crystal structure especially under overcharge state. During the charge process, LiCoO 2 releases Li ion, and Li 1 −xCoO 2 is formed. The <b>safety</b> <b>circuits</b> in the devices stop charging at x = 0.5 (3.9 V). In x > 0.5, the structure of LiCoO 2 collapses, and oxygen is released into the electrolyte. This oxygen causes the decomposition of electrolyte by oxidation and sometimes makes serious problems such as fire hazard and battery explosion.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the course}} of his {{lifetime}} Granville Woods would obtain more than 50 patents for inventions including an automatic brake and an egg incubator and for improvements to other inventions such as <b>safety</b> <b>circuits,</b> telegraph, telephone, and phonograph. He died on January 30, 1910 in New York City, having sold a number of his devices to such companies as Westinghouse, General Electric and American Engineering. Until 1975, his resting place was an unmarked grave, but historian M.A. Harris helped to raise funds, and persuaded several of the corporations that used Woods's inventions to donate towards a headstone. It was erected at St. Michael's Cemetery in Elmhurst, Queens NY.|$|R
50|$|The {{first few}} {{production}} Saleen S7 electrical systems were designed and hand-built by Jimmy Rodriguez. Standard electronics include: Power windows, locks, remote control operated doors, hood, trunk, and engine compartment openers, {{electronic power steering}} with redundant <b>safety</b> <b>circuits,</b> 110 volt inlet for maintaining vehicle battery, electronic heated front window, electronic fuel pump shut off upon crash impact, rearview camera system with in-dash flip-up monitor, and navigation. Electrical wire harnesses are manufactured with the highest quality materials. Teflon-coated tinned military specification wire, cannon plugs, gold plated pins and sockets {{were used for the}} connectors, and wire harnesses were wrapped with a high-temperature glass mesh under a woven Kevlar outer skin.|$|R
5000|$|Fig. 3 shows {{a typical}} Pulses Plus schematic. The pack {{includes}} diodes in each branch {{to minimize the}} possibility of reverse charging the cells. PTCs, or positive temperature coefficient thermistors act as resettable fuses. PTCs begin to get warm at a trip current. The warmth increases their resistance which produces even more heat, and the PTC quickly [...] "trips" [...] and shuts off most of the current. The PTC rarely trips in a typical ADCP pack, because the <b>safety</b> <b>circuit</b> is the primary protection against short circuits (defined to be any current above about 8 A). The <b>safety</b> <b>circuit</b> also turns off the pack before its voltage falls below a threshold. If the pack were allowed to fully discharge, one branch could discharge before the others, {{which could lead to}} the discharged branch being charged by the remaining cells. Any attempt to charge a lithium cell is potentially dangerous, and turning the pack off at about 75-80% of its starting voltage prevents this from happening. At this voltage, only around 3% of the capacity remains, but the remaining capacity still allows years for disposal of the pack before it discharges fully.|$|E
5000|$|A 'force-guided {{contacts}} relay' has {{relay contacts}} that are mechanically linked together, {{so that when}} the relay coil is energized or de-energized, all of the linked contacts move together. If one set of contacts in the relay becomes immobilized, no other contact of the same relay will be able to move. The function of force-guided contacts is to enable the <b>safety</b> <b>circuit</b> to check the status of the relay. Force-guided contacts are also known as [...] "positive-guided contacts", [...] "captive contacts", [...] "locked contacts", [...] "mechanically linked contacts", or [...] "safety relays".|$|E
5000|$|The {{self test}} {{indicates}} that the battery and its <b>safety</b> <b>circuit</b> work, that the battery voltage is within an acceptable range, that the battery can supply an 8 A pulse of current, and that the battery will protect itself against a short. The test confirms that the battery pack is new. If a new battery tests used, the supplier should be contacted. In some circumstances, a battery that is stored at a cold temperature could produce a test result that indicates it has been used, even though it holds its full original capacity.|$|E

5000|$|The Muller C-element (C-gate, Hysteresis {{flip-flop}} or sometimes, coincident flip-flop, two-hand <b>safety</b> <b>circuit)</b> {{is a small}} {{digital block}} widely used in design of asynchronous circuits and systems. It has been specified formally in 1955 by David E. Muller [...] and first used in ILLIAC II computer.

The C-element is closely related to the Rendezvous [...] and Join [...] elements, where an input is not allowed to change twice in succession. For asynchronous circuits, where relations between some delays are known in advance, the requirements for C-element can be less stiff. Earlier techniques for implementing the C-element [...] include Schmidt trigger, Eccles-Jordan flip-flop and last moving point flip-flop.|$|E
