25|$|Murdoch and Moody {{oversaw the}} {{lowering}} of Boat 15 concurrently with Boat 13 and {{it reached the}} water only a minute later, at 1:41a.m. Fireman Frank Dymond {{was put in charge}} of what was the most heavily loaded boat at launching, with about 65 people aboard. It was so heavily loaded that the gunwales were reported to be far down in the water; one female passenger later said that when <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> gunwale her hair trailed in the water. The boat {{was one of the last}} to be recovered by Carpathia, at about 7:30a.m.|$|E
60|$|Elizabeth {{paused for}} breath {{at the top}} of the third flight of stairs. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> iron balustrade.|$|E
60|$|Reaching it she turned, and {{her hands}} still {{pressing}} the coarse blue gown against her heart, <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> door.|$|E
50|$|In 1965, {{the team}} reached the semi-final Algeria Football Cup, where <b>she</b> <b>leans</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Mostagan√©mois the ESM.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> heavily <b>against</b> <b>the</b> doorpost, shivering.... Holder saw Sally Grover {{coming down}} the stairs.|$|R
60|$|Sir John frowned. Anna was unimpressed. Elegant, {{a little}} scornful, <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> {{slightly}} <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{back of a}} chair and looked him steadily in the eyes.|$|R
60|$|Helen shuddered. Almost fainting, <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> porch, too {{horrified to}} cry out, with {{contracting}} {{heart and a}} chill stealing through her veins.|$|E
6000|$|... "What?" [...] said Estella, {{preserving}} {{her attitude}} of indifference as <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> great chimney-piece and only moving her eyes; [...] "do you reproach {{me for being}} cold? You?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> tree-hole {{plaiting}} and unplaiting chance-plucked grass stems. The {{children in}} the wood had drawn nearer. I could see them with the tail of my eye frolicking like squirrels.|$|E
6000|$|... "St. John's!" [...] <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> back <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{piano and}} laughed unrestrainedly. [...] "That's a good one, {{to think how}} {{straight}} I've been talking to you." ...|$|R
60|$|She stood {{staring at}} him, as in terror, {{suddenly}} penetrated by a dismay that sapped her strength, and <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> heavily <b>against</b> <b>the</b> fireplace, clutching the mantel-shelf.|$|R
60|$|Her grip relaxed. Her hands dropped {{slowly to}} her side. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> back <b>against</b> <b>the</b> circle of his arms, {{and looked up}} at him--a strange look, full of a sweet humility.|$|R
60|$|He obeyed. There was {{something}} changed about her, something {{which he did}} not recognise. She thrust her hands into a box of cigarettes, took one out and lit it. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> table, facing him.|$|E
60|$|Margie {{had fallen}} asleep, her head pillowed in her mother's lap; and Mrs. Stevens, unwilling {{to disturb the}} child, was taking such rest as was {{possible}} while <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> canvas covering of the wagon.|$|E
60|$|And {{then she}} began to laugh. I never heard a girl laugh so much. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> side of the veranda and shrieked. And all the while Freddie, the World's Champion Chump, stood there, saying nothing.|$|E
60|$|But {{she looked}} pertly in his face, stood her guitar upright before her, {{and put her}} hands behind her back as <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> saucily <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall and shrugged her shoulders.|$|R
50|$|That {{night he}} arrives at Diana's house. They begin having sex. She is unstable, desperate and frantic. He is {{confused}} and concerned. She stops, pulls away and puts on a T-shirt. <b>She</b> <b>leans</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall going {{through a series of}} intense emotions from sobbing to laughing. She verbalizes that what they are doing is wrong though seems to find it funny. Diana's roommate returns unexpectedly. Eric prepares to flee from being caught, Diana no longer cares if they are caught. Diana begs him to stay. He is now freaked out by Diana's behavior and leaves {{right in front of her}} roommate.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{meant to}} get off, I suppose," [...] she said. [...] "I don't believe I'm going any farther." [...] <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> back <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{bars of the}} bench, and put up one of her slim arms along the top.|$|R
60|$|As {{she spoke}} <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{edge of the}} big rock that stood in their way. To her {{surprise}} it slowly swung backward and showed behind it a dark hole that looked like {{the mouth of a}} tunnel.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{side of the}} dining-table, {{beyond which}} Lemuel sat, and searched his fallen countenance with a glance {{contrived}} to be at once piercing and reproachful. [...] "I see," [...] she said, [...] "you have not forgiven me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What are you {{thinking}} of?" [...] he asked, curiously, interrupting their silence. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> rocks and kept a changeless, tranquil, unseeing gaze on the desert. The level eyes were full of thought, of sadness, of mystery; they seemed to look afar.|$|E
60|$|Her hand {{upon the}} door, {{laughter}} seized her again, so that for support <b>she</b> had to <b>lean</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, if I am a {{trouble to}} you, be it so. Be {{it as you}} wish," [...] and <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> back <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall of the rock, and {{crossing}} her arms upon her breast looked {{away from him and}} fixed her eyes upon the sharp granite peaks of Canigou.|$|R
60|$|She swayed a moment, and {{the colour}} died from her cheeks, leaving them ivory pale. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> heavily <b>against</b> <b>the</b> table, {{and turned over}} in her mind what she had heard. And then, as {{suddenly}} as it had gone, the blood rushed back into her face, mounting to her very temples.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> iron palings of a {{house for}} support, while Mr. Jobson, {{standing}} on the kerb, {{looked up and down}} the road for a cab. A four-wheeler appeared just in time to prevent the scandal--of Mrs. Jobson removing her boots in the street.|$|E
60|$|The {{door opened}} to a gaunt figure, partly {{composed}} of bed-quilt and partly of plaid shawl. A predominance {{of the latter}} and a long wisp of iron-gray hair determined her sex. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> post {{with an air of}} fatigue, half moral and half physical.|$|E
60|$|Even {{now when}} at last she was alone, when once again {{she was able to}} close and bolt the door, she could {{scarcely}} stand. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall with eyes closed, and heart that beat so furiously and so fast that she thought she must choke.|$|E
6000|$|A priest {{stood before}} the lighted altar holding his hands in benediction over a pair who kneeled at its rail. One of these wore a red cloak down which her dark hair streamed. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> heavily <b>against</b> <b>the</b> rail, as a person might who is faint with sleep or with the ardour of her orisons. It was Red Eve, no other! ...|$|R
60|$|She {{felt the}} touch of Dolly's muzzle on her arm, and <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> her head <b>against</b> <b>the</b> mare's neck and waited. She knew not why she waited, nor for what, only there seemed nothing else but waiting left for her to do.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is Mr. Wrenn, isn't it?" [...] <b>she</b> gurgled, and <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> doorpost, merry, {{apparently}} indolent. [...] "I'm Mrs. Ferrard. Mr. Poppins told me {{you were}} coming, and he said you were a terribly nice man, and I was to be sure and welcome you. Come right in." ...|$|R
60|$|Brand left her, and <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> big newel-post {{and tried}} to keep calm. The thing she dreaded most was not to happen. In some miraculous way she was free! She {{wondered}} with keen anxiety what her father and Harding were talking about. Davies, she knew, had left the house a few moments after Brand.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{window for}} another minute, {{struggling}} {{with an almost}} uncontrollable longing, and looking out upon the sweep of golden wheat and whitened grass with brimming eyes, until there was a rattle of wheels, and she saw Edmonds drive away. She heard voices in the corridor, and it became evident that Hastings was speaking to his wife.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him for a moment with a strange expression. Then she rose to her feet. Her lips were quivering. <b>She</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> mantelpiece, with her {{forehead}} upon her arms. At first he imagined that she was going to weep; then, to his horror, he found that she was laughing--half-hysterically, perhaps, but still laughing. He drew a step nearer to her, but she waved him away.|$|E
60|$|When he {{had gone}} she shifted the load of wood to her other {{shoulder}} and started on, in her breast a quiet thrill of pride in Billy. Though behind prison bars, still <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> his strength. <b>The</b> mere naming of him was sufficient to drive away a brute like Charley Long.|$|R
60|$|Seating herself where <b>she</b> could <b>lean</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> saddle <b>she</b> {{prepared}} {{to maintain a}} sleepless vigil throughout the night. For an hour the silence was {{broken only by the}} distant booming of the guns and the low noises of the feeding horse and then, from possibly a mile away, came the rumbling thunder of a lion's roar. The girl started and laid her hand upon the rifle at her side. A little shudder ran through her slight frame and she could feel the goose flesh rise upon her body.|$|R
60|$|A breeze {{which had}} crossed a {{thousand}} miles of wheat-lands bellied her taffeta skirt in a line so graceful, so full of animation and moving beauty, that {{the heart of a}} chance watcher on the lower road tightened to wistfulness over her quality of suspended freedom. She lifted her arms, <b>she</b> <b>leaned</b> back <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wind, her skirt dipped and flared, a lock blew wild. A girl on a hilltop; credulous, plastic, young; drinking the air as she longed to drink life. The eternal aching comedy of expectant youth.|$|R
