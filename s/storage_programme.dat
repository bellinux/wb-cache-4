The French government proposed a construction of a dam at Serre de la Fare on the upper Loire {{which would have been}} an environmental catastrophe, as it would have inundated some [...] of pristine gorges. As a result, the WWF and other NGOs established the Loire Vivante (Living Loire) network in 1988 to oppose the Serre de la Fare dam scheme and arranged an initial meeting with the French Minister of the Environment. The French government initially rejected the conservation concerns and in 1989 gave the dam projects the green light. This sparked public demonstrations by the WWF and conservation groups. In 1990, Loire Vivante met with the French Prime Minister and the government, this time successfully as the government later demanded that the EPALA embark upon major reforms in its approach to managing the river. Due to extensive lobbying, the proposal and the other dam proposals were eventually rejected in the 1990s and the Serre de la Fare area has since been protected as a ‘Natura 2000’ site under European Union environmental legislation.|$|E

The {{objective of this}} workshop is to share experiences and progress in cloud storage services. The usage of recently deployed services {{in the scientific community}} is rapidly expanding. Users are actively interested in new solutions for their growing data needs: new tools and enhanced data sharing capabilities enable new solutions. At the same time, the technology space is quickly evolving and many research institutes, service providers, software development teams and companies look into different approaches in the area of Cloud Services for Synchronisation and Sharing. In the workshop we will review the state-of-the-art technologies for Cloud Services for Synchronisation and Sharing and evaluate the experience in running such services for technical and scientific communities. We especially invite user communities to report on current and planned usage, novel applications and innovative workflows. We invite technology and service providers to present their services, including the evolution of existing implementations towards Cloud Storage Services.

Early prototypes of innovative non-traditional working storage exist: systems having at their centre synchronisation and sharing capabilities are natural candidates to host demanding data processing in the future. Large-scale synchronization and sharing capabilities are already challenging existing IT infrastructures in all areas, from security models to integration with compute resources. This situation calls for renewing computing infrastructures and the way research is done locally and across collaborating institutes. We will meet at the 3 rd Cloud Services for Synchronisation and Sharing (CS 3) Conference to review the state-of-the-art and share experiences about cloud storage services. The community which gathered around the previous CS 3 events includes users, service providers and developers of technological solutions. As in the past, the conference will maximise the opportunity to liaise with key actors of the community. In the previous CS 3 conferences we witnessed the grow in complexity of Cloud Storage installations along the maturing of related technologies. Key actors in the Cloud Storage met at CS 3 bridging between the evolution of technologies (and the need to standardise and interoperate) with new ideas from user communities exposing their experience and needs. Three facts became clear during last conference at the ETH in Zurich: 	Existence of a vital community convinced on the potential of Cloud Storage technologies 	Demonstration of Cloud Storage as new platform for scientific and technical research 	Need of a Cloud Storage federation to enable collaborative research across different institutes and infrastructures An hallmark of CS 3 {{has always been to}} invite companies and development teams to share their experience and plans: they are invited to submit abstracts about their strategy and their technologies to be openly discussed.

The Hontomin storage structure {{is located in}} formations of lower Jurassic age: marls as the upper seal, calcites and dolomites as the storage formation, and anhydrites as lower seal. The borehole setup at Hontomin will consist of three wells: One injection well, one geophysical monitoring well, and one multilevel fluid monitoring well, in a triangular setting. The geophysical monitoring well will be located 100 m from the injection well, and the multilevel fluid monitoring well 40 m from the injection well. The injection well will be equipped with ERT electrodes, a fiber optic Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) system with a heating element, extensometers, and fluid pressure sensors. The geophysical monitoring well will be equipped with the same sensors plus an array of geophones. The multilevel fluid sampling well will be equipped with sampling ports for multiphase fluid sampling, a DTS with heating element, extensometers and fluid pressure sensors. The DTS {{will be used to}} measure temperature profiles, and, in combination with the heating element, to determine changes in heat conductivity and heat capacity induced by CO 2 injection. The extensometers will measure deformation of the storage and seal formations. Hydrogeochemical characterization will comprise the following tests: • Several injection and pumping tests using water and acid in combination with conservative and reactive tracers in order to measure the transport parameters and chemical properties of the porous medium. • Injection and recovery of supercritical CO 2 in combination with conservative and reactive gaseous tracers, in order to study the trapping mechanisms for CO 2. After the characterization phase, up to 100. 000 tons of supercritical CO 2 will be injected into the storage formation. Continuous and intermittent injection regimes will be applied to optimize injectivity and CO 2 dissolution in the brine. Before, during and after these tests, fluid sampling, pressure and deformation measurements, geophysical logs, ERT and passive and active seismic monitoring will determine how the storage and sealing formations react to the stimulations. Drilling of the wells will start in mid- 2011, and hydrogeochemical characterization will start in early 2012. The experiments are funded by the Spanish Government through the CUIDEN foundation, and by the European Commission through the FP 7 project MUSTANG ("A multiple space and time scale approach for the quantification of deep saline formations for CO 2 storage"; contract number 227286).

40|$|The ocean’s {{biological}} carbon pump plays {{a central}} role in regulating atmospheric CO 2 levels. In particular, the depth at which sinking organic carbon is broken down and respired in the mesopelagic zone is critical, with deeper remineralisation resulting in greater carbon storage. Until recently, however, a balanced budget of the supply and consumption of organic carbon in the mesopelagic had not been constructed in any region of the ocean, and the processes controlling organic carbon turnover are still poorly understood. Large-scale data syntheses suggest that a wide range of factors can influence remineralisation depth including upper-ocean ecological interactions, and interior dissolved oxygen concentration and temperature. However these analyses do not provide a mechanistic understanding of remineralisation, which increases the challenge of appropriately modelling the mesopelagic carbon dynamics. In light of this, the UK Natural Environment Research Council has funded a programme with this mechanistic understanding as its aim, drawing targeted fieldwork right through to implementation of a new parameterisation for mesopelagic remineralisation within an IPCC class global biogeochemical model. The Controls over Ocean Mesopelagic Interior Carbon <b>Storage</b> (COMICS) <b>programme</b> will deliver new insights into the processes of carbon cycling in the mesopelagic zone and how these influence ocean carbon storage.

40|$|Groundwater {{in shallow}} unconsolidated {{sedimentary}} aquifers {{close to the}} Bornheim fault in the Lower Rhine Embayment (LRE), Germany, has relatively low d 2 H and d 18 O values in comparison to regional modern groundwater recharge, and 4 He concentrations up to 1. 7 ¿×¿ 10 - 4 cm 3 (STP) g– 1 ¿±¿ 2. 2 % which is approximately four orders of magnitude higher than expected due to solubility equilibrium with the atmosphere. Groundwater age dating based on estimated in situ production and terrigenic flux of helium provides a groundwater residence time of ~ 107 years. Although fluid exchange between the deep basal aquifer system and the upper aquifer layers is generally impeded by confining clay layers and lignite, this study’s geochemical data suggest, for the first time, that deep circulating fluids penetrate shallow aquifers in the locality of fault zones, implying that sub-vertical fluid flow occurs along faults in the LRE. However, large hydraulic-head gradients observed across many faults suggest that they act as barriers to lateral groundwater flow. Therefore, the geochemical data reported here also substantiate a conduit-barrier model of fault-zone hydrogeology in unconsolidated sedimentary deposits, as well as corroborating the concept that faults in unconsolidated aquifer systems can act as loci for hydraulic connectivity between deep and shallow aquifers. The implications of fluid flow along faults in sedimentary basins worldwide are far reaching and of particular concern for carbon capture and <b>storage</b> (CCS) <b>programmes,</b> impacts of deep shale gas recovery for shallow groundwater aquifers, and nuclear waste storage sites where fault zones could act as potential leakage pathways for hazardous fluids...|$|R

Increasing consumer concern regarding food safety and demand for organically produced fruits makes it necessary to search for natural environmentally friendly alternative products and processes for the fruit industry; particularly in disease control. Antifungal effects of Gum Arabic (GA) (10 %), Aloe vera (AL) (2 %), chitosan (CH) (1 %) alone or in combination with thyme oil (1 %) were investigated in vitro. CH + thyme oil and AL + thyme oil [1 : 1 or 3 : 1 v/v] showed fungicidal effects while AL, CH, GA and GA + thyme oil [3 : 1 v/v] showed fungistatic effects on mycelial growth of C. gloeosporioides in vitro. CH and AL coatings alone or in combination with thyme oil [3 : 1 v/v], either as preventative or curative treatments in comparison with commercial treatment (prochloraz, 0. 05 %) and untreated control were evaluated on incidence and severity (lesion diameter) of anthracnose in vivo. Preventative CH + thyme oil treatments significantly reduced the severity of anthracnose (8. 9 mm) compared to thyme oil (12. 7 mm), AL + TO (14. 4 mm), CH (17. 8 mm), AL (20. 6 mm), PZ (18. 3 mm) and untreated samples (34. 8 mm).

40|$|Allocation {{of water}} for {{agriculture}} has decreased due to increased demand {{as a result of}} population growth, industrial development, and water pollution. Irrigation management aiming at efficient use of water has become a high priority. Deficit irrigation (DI), if applied judiciously, saves water, decreases vegetative growth and pruning costs, reduces leaching of agrichemicals into ground water, and may improve fruit quality. In apple, there is less beneficial effect of DI on shoot growth reduction because fruit set and cell division phases occur {{at the same time as}} predominant shoot growth and so DI applied during this period will reduce fruit size. However, there appear to be potential of DI in apple fruit quality improvement but research findings on this aspect have been inconclusive. To promote the adoption of DI in apple production, there is need to confirm and expand the effects of DI on fruit quality and to minimise DI effects on fruit size reduction. This study was to confirm DI effects on fruit quality by addressing relationship between fruit size and quality and to investigate DI effects on under-researched aspects of fruit quality such as physiological disorders, maturation and ripening, aroma volatiles, and storage potential. The possibility of integrating light crop load with DI to increase fruit size was also explored by investigating interactions of DI and crop load on tree water use, fruit size regulation, yield, and quality. The study involves three experiments. Irrigation treatments include control irrigation (CI), early deficit irrigation (EDI) applied from 63 to 118 days after full bloom (DAFB), late deficit irrigation (LDI) applied from approximately 118 DAFB until final harvest, and whole-season deficit irrigation (WDI) applied from 12 DAFB until final harvest. Crop load treatments, which were included in two experiments, were commercial crop load (CCL) and light crop load (LCL) equivalent to 60 - 67 % of CCL. 'Braeburn' apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) was used in all experiments. Deficit irrigation applied at any time during the growing season reduced fruit growth and size. Fruit size reduction by DI was counteracted by a lighter crop load. The interactions of DI and crop load on photosynthetic rate, fruit water potential, and fruit turgor potential (which were generally similar between CCL and LCL under CI but were lower in CCL under DI) are possible mechanisms for this counteraction. Tree water use (TWU) was reduced in DI and in LCL. The difference in TWU between CI and DI were greater at CCL than at LCL and that between CCL and LCL were greater under CI than under DI. Among the quality attributes studied, only firmness and dry matter concentration (DMC) were affected by fruit size with their values being higher in smaller fruit. The DI fruit were firmer and had higher DMC than CI fruit when comparing fruit of similar size. Total soluble solids (TSS) and total sugar concentration (TSC) were higher in DI fruit than in CI fruit in all experiments. In general, DI did not affect titratable acidity (TA) except for one experiment where TA at harvest was higher in EDI fruit than in CI fruit. Fruit ripened more quickly in LDI and WDI than in EDI which was similar in this respect to CI. The advancement in ripening of DI fruit appeared to be responsible for the enhanced production of aroma volatiles. This enhancement was observed on some occasions during ripening and after cold storage. Deficit irrigation may increase storage potential of the fruit as DI did not affect incidence of physiological disorders but decreased the weight loss during storage. The DI fruit were also firmer than CI fruit for at least 10 weeks of cold storage but this advantage was loss after longer storage due to the advanced ripening of the DI fruit. Apart from the enhancement on individual quality attributes, DI also improved overall fruit quality when many quality attributes were considered collectively using multivariate analysis. This was true both at harvest and after storage. There was no interaction between irrigation and crop load on any quality attributes under investigation. Light crop load improved fruit quality at harvest in terms of increased firmness, TSS, TSC and fruit density but increased weight loss during storage and incidence of bitter pit after <b>storage.</b> This research <b>programme</b> showed that deficit irrigation has a great potential as a strategy to save water and to improve fruit quality in apple production. 'Braeburn' is a large-fruited variety. Although fruit size was reduced under DI, DI fruit still met standard export requirements. In situations where price favours large size fruit, light crop load may be integrated with DI to increase fruit size but light crop load may adversely affect fruit quality after storage...|$|R
