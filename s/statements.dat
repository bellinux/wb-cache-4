5|$|In 1936, Ayer wrote Language, Truth and Logic, {{in which}} he claimed that {{religious}} language is meaningless. He put forward a strong empirical position, arguing that all knowledge must either come from observations of the world or be necessarily true, like mathematical <b>statements.</b> In doing so, he rejected metaphysics, which considers {{the reality of a}} world beyond the natural world and science. Because it is based on metaphysics and is therefore unverifiable, Ayer denounced religious language, as well as <b>statements</b> about ethics or aesthetics, as meaningless. Ayer challenged the meaningfulness of all <b>statements</b> about God– theistic, atheistic and agnostic– arguing that they are all equally meaningless because they all discuss the existence of a metaphysical, unverifiable being.|$|E

5|$|The Court {{concluded}} that the conflict of interest materialized in a few ways.

Stewart also failed to object to the testimony of other witnesses regarding prior <b>statements</b> of Kretske; under the rules of hearsay, these <b>statements</b> were obviously admissible against Kretske, but less obviously admissible against Glasser without a predicate showing that Glasser was a co-conspirator. Stewart feared that an objection only on behalf of Glasser would highlight the admissibility of the <b>statements</b> against Kretske.|$|E
