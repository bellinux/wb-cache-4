5|$|The main Animal Lifestyles exhibit {{consists}} of a troop of hamadryas baboons. Zoo visitors may observe the troop in a large glassed-in gallery which looks out into a rocky outcrop. Small caves in the outcrop lead to interior burrows where the animals may avoid inclement weather. The rear wall of the gallery illustrates common forms of baboon signalling and behavior, along with other <b>social</b> <b>aspects</b> of the animals. Ample seating allows visitors to observe the troop.|$|E
5|$|While the Social Gospel {{was making}} inroads within the denomination, the {{ministry}} of baseball player turned evangelist Billy Sunday demonstrated that Evangelicalism and the revivalist tradition was still a force within the denomination. Sunday became the most prominent evangelist of the early 20th century, preaching to over 100 million people and leading an estimated million to conversion throughout his career. Whereas Stelzle emphasized the <b>social</b> <b>aspects</b> of Christianity, Sunday's focus was primarily on the conversion and moral responsibility of the individual.|$|E
5|$|Miller's Language and Communication {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{significant}} texts in the study of language behavior. The book was a scientific study of language, emphasizing quantitative data, and was based on the mathematical model of Claude Shannon's information theory. It used a probabilistic model imposed on a learning-by-association scheme borrowed from behaviorism, with Miller not yet attached to a pure cognitive perspective. The first part of the book reviewed information theory, the physiology and acoustics of phonetics, speech recognition and comprehension, and statistical techniques to analyze language. The focus was more on speech generation than recognition. The second part had the psychology: idiosyncratic differences across people in language use; developmental linguistics; the structure of word associations in people; use of symbolism in language; and <b>social</b> <b>aspects</b> of language use.|$|E

As his writing career continued, however, his stories evolved {{to focus on the}} <b>social</b> <b>aspects</b> and often negative consequences of those inventions.

He is also condemning human ignorance, warning against xenophobia, and asking philosophical questions {{about the nature of the}} universe, happiness and human destiny. Zajdel's works from his second period - late 1970s and 1980s - and represent the genres of social and dystopian fiction.

5|$|Supporters of the emergentist {{coalition}} model argue that, as a hybrid, {{this model}} moves towards a more holistic explanation of word learning {{that is not}} captured by models with a singular focus. For instance, constraints theories typically argue that constraints/principles are available to children from the onset of word learning, but do not explain how children develop into expert speakers who are not limited by constraints. Additionally, some argue that domain-general perspectives do not fully {{address the question of}} how children sort through numerous potential referents in order to correctly sort out meaning. Lastly, social pragmatic theories claim that social encounters guide word learning. Although these theories describe how children become more advanced word learners, they seem to tell us little about children's capacities at the start of word learning. According to its proponents, the emergentist coalion model incorporates constraints/principles, but argues for the development and change in these principles over time, while simultaneously taking into consideration <b>social</b> <b>aspects</b> of word learning alongside other cues, such as salience.|$|E

30|$|However, {{a closer}} look reveals that the problem was not re-defined, but rather the outcome. The SCOT {{approach}} actually places strong emphasis on the <b>social</b> <b>aspect.</b> One frequent criticism of SCOT is that the <b>social</b> <b>aspect</b> holds too much weight, that by proposing a theory dissociated from technological determinism, SCOT ended up providing the exact opposite—an explanation of technological developments based on sociological determinism (Hennen 1992 : 41 f; Schulz-Schaeffer 2000 : 26 ff; MacKenzie and Wajcman 2010 : xiv). Especially in the first period, when SCOT presented itself as a new paradigm for sociological analysis of technology, the argumentation tended to treat the <b>social</b> <b>aspect</b> as changeless and fixed. In turn, technology {{had to be very}} mutable and was adjusted to the fixed needs of the <b>social</b> <b>aspect.</b> The burden of developing technology successfully lay solely on the <b>social</b> <b>aspect</b> and the reconciliation of various orientations and problems of the relevant social groups involved. In fact, what is proposed as problem re-definition is solution re-definition. What was originally presumed to be the solution to a problem was re-defined by technology presenting a new solution to the same problem that could be now solved in a new, previously disregarded way (Pinch and Bijker 1999 : 44 ff). A single social group’s goal and its related problems remain the same: What can change is the way this social group is able to imagine a (new) solution to the (same) problem.|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} an {{exploration}} of whether golf-related online community use is related to sport involvement, social capital, the <b>social</b> <b>aspect</b> of life satisfaction and golf participation. Golf-related online community use was measured in two ways: total time spent in online communities {{and the extent of}} contribution in online communities. The study is best characterised as quantitative research. In total, 101 usable responses to an online questionnaire were received using convenience sampling. The data was analysed with mean difference testing and correlation analyses. It was found that those who contribute more often in online communities experience greater levels of one of the three dimensions of involvement, bonding and bridging social capital and the <b>social</b> <b>aspect</b> of life satisfaction. There {{was no significant difference between}} those who lurked (individuals who do not post but regularly read content in online communities) and those who contributed in two of the three sport involvement dimensions, the influence of golf on the <b>social</b> <b>aspect</b> of life satisfaction and the average number of rounds of golf played per month. The correlation analyses suggest that when an individual spends more time online they are likely to report greater levels of all three dimensions of sport involvement, bonding social capital, bridging social capital and a greater influence of golf on the <b>social</b> <b>aspect</b> of life satisfaction. However, the analysis did not suggest an individual would play more golf, improve their handicap or report greater levels of the <b>social</b> <b>aspect</b> of life satisfaction if they spent more time in online communities. Recommendations are made for future researchers and implications are identified for sport managers...|$|R
