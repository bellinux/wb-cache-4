5|$|A bulk carrier's {{design is}} largely {{defined by the}} cargo it will carry. The cargo's density, also known as its <b>stowage</b> <b>factor,</b> is the key factor. Densities for common bulk cargoes vary from 0.6tons per cubic meter for light grains to 3tons per cubic meter for iron ore.|$|E
25|$|There {{are some}} {{differences}} {{between the first and}} the second series of barges. The first two were built with lower side coamings due to the limited clearance under the loader at the port of Luleå. When the Finnpusku system was developed, the volume enclosed by the fixed coamings was included in the tonnage of the barge by the rules regarding ship measurement, so to minimize this the side coamings in Kalla and Tasku consisted of removable cassettes held in place by vertical supports. However, the rules were later changed so that none of the open deck was included in tonnage assessment, so the last three barges had their cassettes welded in place. The second series was also originally designed with higher coamings all around to increase capacity for cargo with low <b>stowage</b> <b>factor,</b> such as coal, but restrictions placed by the cargo handling equipment of the ports resulted in a compromise with lower coamings forward of the side ramps and higher towards the aft.|$|E
50|$|The <b>stowage</b> <b>factor</b> {{varies from}} {{one type of}} {{commodity}} to another — for example iron ore has a <b>stowage</b> <b>factor</b> of 0.40 (m3/mt), meaning that the space needed by one tonne of ore is only one sixth of that required to stow one tonne of woodchips that have a <b>stowage</b> <b>factor</b> of 2.5. This means that if a ship designed to carry woodchips is loaded with iron ore, {{only a small part}} of the hold capacity can be utilized, and a bulk carrier designed to carry iron ore cannot be loaded to the maximum draft with woodchips, leaving much of its deadweight tonnage unutilized. Thus the <b>stowage</b> <b>factor</b> is taken into account in ship design when determining the size of cargo holds, and specialized ships such as ore carriers and car carriers are built for cargoes with a <b>stowage</b> <b>factor</b> that departs significantly from the average.|$|E
40|$|At a {{level of}} {{individual}} goods, heterogeneity of marginal transaction costs, proxied by price-to-weight ratios and <b>stowage</b> <b>factors,</b> explains {{a large part of}} the variation in thresholds of no-adjustment and conditional half-lives of law of one price deviations. Prices of heavier (more voluminous) goods deviate further before becoming mean-reverting. Moreover, after becoming mean-reverting, prices of heavier goods converge more slowly. Together with measures of pricing power, market size, distance, and exchange rate volatility, these factors explain up to 43 % of variation in no-adjustment threshold estimates across 52 goods in US-Canada post-Bretton Woods monthly CPI data and are robust in a broader five-country dataset. They open two avenues for the importance of marginal transaction costs in accounting for real exchange rate persistence: through (a) generating persistence in individual real exchange rate components, and (b) accentuating it by the aggregation of heterogeneous components ("aggregation bias" of Imbs et[*]al., 2005 a).

50|$|The <b>stowage</b> <b>factor</b> {{also depends}} {{on the type of}} packaging, being the lowest for {{unpackaged}} bulk cargo. While most commonly used for dry bulk cargo, a <b>stowage</b> <b>factor</b> can also be calculated for liquid bulk cargo and other commodities such as containers or cars. Stowage factors for several types of cargo are presented in the following table.|$|E
50|$|In shipping, the <b>stowage</b> <b>factor</b> {{indicates}} {{how many}} cubic metres of space one metric tonne (or {{cubic feet of}} space one long ton) of {{a particular type of}} cargo occupies in a hold of a cargo ship. It is calculated as the ratio of the stowage space required under normal conditions, including the stowage losses caused by the means of transportation and packaging, to the weight of the cargo. The <b>stowage</b> <b>factor</b> can be used in ship design and as a reference to evaluate the efficiency of use of the cargo space on a ship.|$|E

40|$|This paper applies modern {{portfolio}} {{theory to}} manage portfolio risk for real shipping investments. The {{aim is to}} propose a multi-factor model for explaining vessel return variation. In doing so, we seek to improve extant research on shipping markets and clarify the underlying risk factors in the industry. To corroborate {{the necessity of a}} more comprehensive model, we include other well-established methods for comparison. The study comprises the three main shipping segments, i. e. wet bulk, dry bulk and container. By including different segments, an investor can diversify segment-specific risks connected to the particular trade flows and seasonal demand patterns. Additionally, we include vessel size and age to enrich the investment universe. Different sized vessels are exposed to different trades due to characteristics of cargo and physical limitations, e. g. <b>stowage</b> <b>factor</b> and canal dimensions. Larger vessels are therefore exposed to more operational risk in terms of flexibility than smaller vessels. The age factor also represents a differing risk profile of the investment, as newer vessels with favorable cost structures are theoretically less risky albeit more expensive. We find clear differences in risk-return characteristics regarding all three aspects between the various vessels. This indicates great diversification potential. We show the superiority of the multi-factor model compared to the naïve and single-index optimization frameworks. Our model highlights five main risk factors and vastly improves the explanatory power of return variation. From a statistical point of view, a diversified portfolio outperforms segment-specific portfolios within dry bulk and container vessels. This is not the case for wet bulk, following the strong performance of recent years. Economically, we find recent trends in shipping to accommodate diversification following a decomposition of the value chain, e. g. Ship Finance International Ltd. This enables diversifying across all segments, in turn reducing cash-flow volatility and possibly adding value for shareholders. nhhma...|$|E
