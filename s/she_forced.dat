She fought at the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805, as part of Nelson's weather column, where <b>she</b> <b>forced</b> the surrender of the Spanish four-decker Santísima Trinidad. Agamemnons later career was served in South American waters off Brazil.|$|E

5|$|In 1935, {{the ship}} had an {{aircraft}} catapult installed, along with a crane to handle floatplanes. The following year, the single 8.8cm guns were replaced with a new triaxially stabilized twin-mount; two other twin mounts were added on the rear superstructure. Fire control directors for the anti-aircraft guns were also installed. After emerging from this refit, Königsberg was employed as a gunnery training ship. During the Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s, the ship participated in non-intervention patrols, during which <b>she</b> <b>forced</b> Republicans to surrender a German freighter they had seized.|$|E

25|$|HMS Cleopatra was a 32-gun Amazon-class fifth rate frigate of the Royal Navy. She {{had a long}} career, seeing service {{during the}} Fourth Anglo-Dutch War, and the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. During the latter wars she fought two notable {{engagement}}s with larger French opponents.

In April she was again part of the Great Britain Fed Cup team but lost her only match against Hungary's Petra Mandula. She spent May failing {{to qualify for the}} tier III tournament, the Internationaux de Strasbourg and the second Grand Slam of the year, the French Open. In June she was given a wild card into the main draw of the DFS Classic but was forced to retire during her first round match against fellow Brit Jane O'Donoghue after {{the first game of the}} final set. She was then awarded another wild card; this one into the qualifying draw of the tier II Hastings Direct International where she was beaten by Virginie Razzano. For the third year running, she received a wild card into the main draw of Wimbledon where <b>she</b> <b>forced</b> the former world number 5, Jelena Dokić, to fight for her eventual three-set victory. This was Baltacha's final match of the year as she underwent invasive surgery after Wimbledon (to determine the cause of her persistent liver troubles) which put her out of action until 2004. As a result, her year-end singles ranking fell to world number 373.|$|E

500|$|Steph {{had several}} romances {{throughout}} {{her time in}} the series. In her early years, Stenson played her as a flirt, who acted out {{for the attention of}} boys. Her first lovers included Christian virgin Brian Drake (Jonathan Le Billon) and football playing [...] "lothario" [...] Scott Anderson (Daniel Hyde). Her later relationship with Cameron Clark (Ben Gerrard) had [...] "ups and downs" [...] due to his obsessive-compulsive disorder. To boost his confidence <b>she</b> <b>forced</b> him to join a rock band. Her [...] actions were successful, and Stenson said Steph was [...] "proud" [...] of this.

500|$|Kreia {{has been}} {{positively}} received. Alexander Gambotto-Burke, for Eurogamer, considered Kreia {{to be the}} greatest villain in video gaming, praising her dialogue, Kestelman's [...] "intelligent and subtle" [...] voice-acting, and the way <b>she</b> <b>forced</b> the player into making choices and considering their decisions. IGN's Hilary Goldstein offered similar praise to her dialogue. When looking at morality in games, Gamasutra's Katherine Cross noted how Kreia's comments affected her more than many of the dark-side/light-side choices in the game. Her [...] "practical" [...] philosophy was also complimented by Kotaku's Phil Owen, who noted its ties to reality over the traditional moral extremes of the Sith and the Jedi. Eurogamers Richard Cobbett considered her the most [...] "famous" [...] of The Sith Lords subversion of Star Wars and the first Knights of the Old Republic, commenting [...] "Whether you agree or think she's crazy, she's a fresh breath of air for the series, and easily one of the best RPG characters ever." ...|$|E
500|$|Simone {{was known}} for her temper and {{frequent}} outbursts. In 1985, she fired a gun at a record company executive, whom she accused of stealing royalties. Simone said she [...] "tried to kill him" [...] but [...] "missed". In 1995, she shot and wounded her neighbor's son with an air gun after the boy's laughter disturbed her concentration. According to a biographer, Simone took medication for a condition from the mid-1960s on. All this was only known to {{a small group of}} intimates, and kept out of public view for many years, until the biography Break Down and Let It All Out written by Sylvia Hampton and David Nathan revealed this in 2004, after her death. [...] Singer-songwriter Janis Ian, a one-time friend of Simone's, related in her own autobiography, Society's Child: My Autobiography, two instances to illustrate Simone's volatility: one incident in which <b>she</b> <b>forced</b> a shoe store cashier, at gunpoint, to take back a pair of sandals she'd already worn; and another in which Simone demanded a royalty payment from Ian herself as an exchange for having recorded one of Ian's songs, and then ripped a pay telephone out of its wall when she was refused.|$|E

Mrs. Long, however, had the original [...] "IOU" [...] from the Matthewses. Dodd said he was convinced that the $163,000 was paid twice.|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked in}} 1941 about whether Wills or Lenglen {{was the better}} player, Elizabeth Ryan, who played against both of them in singles and partnered both in doubles, said, [...] "Suzanne, of course. She owned every kind of shot, plus a genius for knowing {{how and when to}} use them." [...] However, Wills and Lenglen are seen as having {{completely}} different skills and strategies. Wills served and volleyed with unusually powerful forehand and backhand strokes, and <b>she</b> <b>forced</b> her opponents out of position by placing deep shots left and right. Lenglen was more physically nimble, and she was more imaginative—able to quickly change shots in response to conditions. Lenglen was a master of the drop shot and close net work, which was Wills' soft spot. Aware of her weakness at the net, Wills drove her opponents deep into the backcourt as much as possible. Playing Wills was, according to Helen Jacobs, like playing [...] "a machine... with implacable concentration and undeniable skill" [...] yet with little flexibility.|$|E
