Of all the persons whom the secret affected, the greater number would not like to have it known.

However, growing scepticism regarding the effects of active policies and very different evaluation findings are the main reason of growing interest in developing the evalution methods of these policies. The paper outlines the key theoretical issues concerning ALMP evaluation and also intends to explain the need of evaluation of these measures, especially in countries which have just joined European Union, for example Poland. The first part describes evaluation purposes nad briefly characterizes differences between various types of evaluation. The second part covers the methodological aspects of ALMP microevalutions, defines the fundamental evaluation problem and reviews some quasiexperimental methods, commonly used in the EU - 15, like before-after designs, matching and parametric regression, and conditional difference in differences estimation, uderlying their <b>strenths</b> and weaknesses. The last part of the article presents some problems of ALMP evaluation in Poland. The paper concludes that the main barriers of implementing evaluation system in Poland are: the lack of funds to conduct systematic evaluations, bad procedures and poorly developed information systems used by public employment services, low quality or the lack of proper statistical data needed for evaluations, and insufficient qualifications of PES’ employees to control and evaluate the effects of ALMP.

Factors such as purposes, age groups and stages of mental development are {{to be taken into}} account in terms of the adoption of a {{teaching method}}. Adult learners of English have their own advantages and disadvantages, too. Normally, the latter outweigh the former. How to obtain the best result out of them? Why take a certain method rather than another is a given context? These are the questions this paper attempts to account for. Since none of the methods in the history of language teaching so far can fulfil 1 the desired goals all in one go, the author holds that for adult beginners, both the Natural Method and Total Physical Response are preferred while the Communicative Approach and Community Language Learning are to find favour with those at intermediate and advanced levels, and that the teaching of composition writing should be guided and integrated with the training of other language skills, particularly at an elementary level. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2009 Many {{conventionally}} {{reinforced concrete}} deck girder bridges (RCDG) and their intermediate supporting bent caps were designed during the Eisenhower interstate {{era of the}} 1950 ’s with the AASHO design equations at the time, which subsequently place higher demand on the concrete. The referenced components may exhibit diagonal cracking due to the initial design assumptions, increased traffic volume and truck weights, as well as temperature and shrinkage affects. Action is needed as these structures approach {{the end of their}} useful design life. Wholesale replacement is not economically feasible; therefore, repair may provide a more attractive alternative to maintain operational safety and freight mobility. The current research program builds on previous work at OSU, which focused on estimating unrepaired specimen capacity, to include various repair methods. The experimental program included full scale testing of specimens with vintage 1950 s details, reinforcing steel, concrete strength/composition, and flexural cutoffs details. Repairs included externally applied steel stirrups, supplemental internal stirrups, externally applied carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP), carbon fiber tape utilized in a near surface mount application, and longitudinal post tensioning (bent cap specimen only). All specimens were initially loaded under quasi-static force control to produce diagonal cracks in the specimen then repaired and tested to failure. Ultimate specimen capacity was compared against that predicted from those available in the literature (where applicable), international codes, sectional Modified Compression Field Theory (MCFT) analysis, Modified Zararis Mechanical Model (bent caps only), Strut-and-Tie methods (bent cap only), and nonlinear finite element analysis (NLFEM). Results indicate the repair methods increased the member strength and the predicted member <b>strenths</b> compare well to certain international codes, sectional MCFT analysis, and nonlinear FEM element analysis. Some repair techniques such as surface mounted CFRP produced disparate outcomes for different specimen types. The NSM repair technique requires additional research to draw general conclusions. Longitudinal post tensioning compared well with the Modified Zararis method. STM methods form a very conservative lower bound for design and are thus not suggested for base specimen capacity prediction in a retrofit analysis. Design recommendations for the deep beams are not provided, as there is not sufficient data to support general conclusions...|$|R
