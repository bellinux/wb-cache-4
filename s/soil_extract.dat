40|$|Herbicides {{residues}} {{were reported}} to have impact on the ecosystem. It was thought that acceleration of paraquat degradation would minimize these impacts. Paraquat was persistent in peat soil due to low pH. This study was done to investigate the role of bacterial isolates on the acceleration of paraquat degradation, especially in peat soil. The bacteria were isolated from several kinds of Indonesian soils using enrichment culture technique in a modified N-free medium. The medium was added with paraquat at gradually increase-concentration from 10, 20, and 40 ppm (w/w). Examinations in paraquat degradation were done in two levels. The first was in a synthetic medium (N-free medium); the second was in <b>soil</b> <b>extract</b> medium. Two kinds of peat were used to make the <b>soil</b> <b>extract</b> media, i. e. fibric and saphric peat soils. Several bacterial isolates were able to degrade paraquat in N-free medium. However, the degradation mode was different with those in peat <b>soil</b> <b>extract</b> media. None of them degraded paraquat in fibric and saphric <b>soil</b> <b>extract</b> media. It was suggested that the environmental limiting factors were responsible to the failure of paraquat degradation. Two selected isolates were able to degrade paraquat when the pH value of the extract medium was enhanced to around 5. 5. Bacterial isolate of SM 1, which was isolated from acid sulfate soil of Central Kalimantan, was the best isolate which was able to degrade paraquat in synthetic medium and peat <b>soil</b> <b>extract</b> media, especially in fibric extract medium. It degraded around 30 %of paraquat within 15 day. Experiments are being done to enhance paraquat degradation by inoculation of mixed cultures of selected bacterial isolates.

40|$|This is an author's peer-reviewed final manuscript, as {{accepted}} by the publisher. The published article is copyrighted by the American Chemical Society {{and can be found}} at: [URL] formation of more polar and toxic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) transformation products is one of the concerns associated with the bioremediation of PAH-contaminated soils. Soil contaminated with coal tar (pre-bioremediation) from a former manufactured gas plant (MGP) site was treated in a laboratory scale bioreactor (post-bioremediation) and extracted using pressurized liquid extraction. The soil extracts were fractionated, based on polarity, and analyzed for 88 PAHs (unsubstituted, oxygenated, nitrated, and heterocyclic PAHs). The PAH concentrations in the soil tested, post-bioremediation, were lower than their regulatory maximum allowable concentrations (MACs), {{with the exception of the}} higher molecular weight PAHs (BaA, BkF, BbF, BaP, and IcdP), most of which did not undergo significant biodegradation. The <b>soil</b> <b>extract</b> fractions were tested for genotoxicity using the DT 40 chicken lymphocyte bioassay and developmental toxicity using the embryonic zebrafish (Danio rerio) bioassay. A statistically significant increase in genotoxicity was measured in the unfractionated <b>soil</b> <b>extract,</b> as well as in four polar <b>soil</b> <b>extract</b> fractions, post-bioremediation (p < 0. 05). In addition, a statistically significant increase in developmental toxicity was measured in one polar <b>soil</b> <b>extract</b> fraction, post-bioremediation (p < 0. 05). A series of morphological abnormalities, including peculiar caudal fin malformations and hyperpigmentation in the tail, were measured in several <b>soil</b> <b>extract</b> fractions in embryonic zebrafish, both pre- and post-bioremediation. The increased toxicity measured post-bioremediation is not likely due to the 88 PAHs measured in this study (including quinones), because most were not present in the toxic polar fractions and/or because their concentrations did not increase post-bioremediation. However, the increased toxicity measured post-bioremediation is likely due to hydroxylated and carboxylated transformation products of the 3 - and 4 -ring PAHs (PHE, 1 MPHE, 2 MPHE, PRY, BaA, and FLA) that were most degraded...|$|E

A 25 -fold increase of the transformation frequency was obtained with nitrogen limitation when SME was supplemented with only pyruvate plus phosphate. Similar results were obtained with artificial <b>soil</b> <b>extract</b> medium prepared {{on the basis of the}} chemical analysis of the <b>soil</b> <b>extract.</b> On a standard minimal medium, transformation frequencies also increased (10 - to 60 -fold) when ammonium, phosphate, or pyruvate was growth limiting.

The 28 day survival/reproduction test revealed that the ecologically more relevant original soil sample was more toxic than the organic <b>soil</b> <b>extract.</b> Microarray analysis showed that the more toxic soil samples induced gene regulatory changes in twice as less genes compared to the <b>soil</b> <b>extract.</b> Consequently gene regulatory changes were highly dependent on sample type, and were {{to a lesser extent}} caused by exposure level.

Finally, we were able to retrieve a selected group of genes that show highly significant dose-dependent gene expression and thus were tightly linked with adverse effects on reproduction. Expression of four cytochrome P 450 genes showed highest correlation values with reproduction, and maybe promising genetic markers for soil quality.

The data included 684 plant tissue analyses and 684 corresponding analyses of saturated <b>soil</b> <b>extracts,</b> all collected between January 2009 and June 2013. The tissue and soil samples were selected from 13 rose farms, and from cultivars grafted on the 'Natal Briar' rootstock. These concurrent samples of soil and plant tissues represented 251 production units (locations) of approximately 10, 000 m 2 distributed across the study area. The standards were conceived as a tool to improve the nutritional balance in the leaf tissue of rose plants and thereby define the norms for expressing optimum productive potential relative to nutritional conditions in the soil. To this end, previously determined diagnostic standard for rose leaf tissues were employed to obtain rates of foliar nutritional balance at each analyzed location and as criteria for determining the diagnostic norms for saturated <b>soil</b> <b>extracts.</b> Implementing this methodology to foliar analysis, showed a higher significant correlation for diagnostic indices. A similar behavior was observed in saturated <b>soil</b> <b>extracts</b> analysis, becoming a powerful tool for integrated nutritional diagnosis.

40|$|<b>Extracts</b> of <b>soil</b> {{are used}} to provide {{estimates}} of plant-available nitrogen sources such as nitrate, ammonium and amino acids (low molecular weight nitrogen, LMW-N). <b>Soil</b> <b>extracts</b> are a blunt tool; they introduce a number of inaccuracies through soil disturbance, and do not indicate the rapidity of N pool turnover. Microdialysis is used predominantly in neuroscience but was recently introduced in soil research. Small in situ probes cause minimal disturbance, and passive diffusion of solutes across a semi-permeable membrane allows dialysate to be collected over time allowing study of nutrient flux dynamics. This sampling mode is functionally similar to plant roots, and may provide a good estimate of the N forms available to roots. We used microdialysis to quantify induced diffusive fluxes of LMW-N in a subtropical agricultural soil under three fertiliser regimes. Shifts in LMW-N fluxes were detected over time, suggesting the formation of depletion zones around the probe surface similar to those associated with roots. A pronounced difference was observed between results from microdialysis and <b>soil</b> <b>extracts.</b> In dialysate, amino acids contributed up to 70 % of LMWN in unfertilised soil and 5 - 20 % in fertilised soils.

Therefore, in the present study, in vitro bioassays were {{used to evaluate the}} adverse effects of TWW and irrigated-soil extract sample, on mammalian cells, with respect to heavy metal—Ni, Cd, Pb, Fe, Al-content. The heat shock protein (HSP) 47, E-screen, and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) assays served to investigate the stress response of treated-HSP 47 -transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, the estrogenic activity of the samples in MCF- 7 breast cancer cells, and the barrier function (BF) of Caco- 2 cells. Furthermore, proteomics analyses were performed to shed light on involved mechanisms and to establish pollution biomarkers. Results showed that the TWW elicited a stress response on HSP cells from 0. 1 % concentration while <b>soil</b> <b>extract</b> samples exhibited a stress at 1 %. TWW induced an estrogenic activity at 10 %; up-regulating cell proliferation and tumor-related proteins. <b>Soil</b> <b>extract</b> triggered the enhanced expression of HSP 70 family proteins as survival mechanisms against their cytotoxicity toward MCF- 7 cells. Moreover, depending on the concentration, 1 % of <b>soil</b> <b>extract</b> from 20 cm depth (T 20) resulted in a disruption of BF in Caco- 2 cells involving cell metabolism, protein synthesis and tumor marker proteins, whereas, 5 % of T 20 induced the expression of BF-related proteins associated to heat shock, oxidative stress, cell proliferation and glycolytic metabolic pathway. These biological techniques were found to be extremely useful to evaluate the impact of wastewater reuse and to establish specific biomarkers that are common proteins for humans, other mammals and plants. Future studies should focus on exposure quantifications...|$|E

40|$|An {{extended}} analytical characterisation of weathered hydrocarbons {{isolated from}} historically contaminated sites in Alberta is presented. The characterisation of <b>soil</b> <b>extracts,</b> chromatographically separated into component classes, by GC- simulated distillation and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) chemical ionisation (CI) GC-MS provides {{new insights into}} the composition of the residual oil at these sites, the principal partition medium for risk critical components. The combined polar and asphaltene content of representative <b>soil</b> <b>extracts</b> ranged from 40 % w/w to 70 % w/w of the oils encountered. An abundance of C 14 –C 22 2 – 4 ring alicyclics, alkylbenzenes and benzocycloparaffins is prevalent within the saturate fractions of site soils. Implications for the partitioning of risk critical compounds at sites with weathered hydrocarbons and the practical application of bioremediation technologies are discu...|$|R
