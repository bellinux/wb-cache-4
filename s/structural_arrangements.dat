Regional councils were reduced in number from 20 to 13, territorial authorities (city/district councils) from 200 to 75, and special purpose bodies from over 400 to 7. The new district and city councils were generally much larger and most covered substantial areas of both {{urban and rural}} land.

25|$|The 5-level {{administrative}} structure. Publicly, the NLF {{was part}} of a spontaneous peoples movement for liberation. In reality it was controlled by COSVN, which in turn was controlled by the Lao Dong party. Some writers suggest that COVSN was an executive committee of the PRP, the Southern Communist Party, with associated staff for coordinating the war effort, but the exact <b>structural</b> <b>arrangements</b> remain ambiguous. The NLF was organized into 3 Interzone headquarters, that were subdivided into 7 smaller headquarters Zones. The Zones were split into Provinces and further subdivided into Districts. These likewise controlled Village and Hamlet elements. Each level was run by a committee, dominated as always by Communist Party operatives.|$|E

His approach in these engagements {{recognizes that the}} problems facing contemporary societies are not distinct from nation to nation, and that general <b>structural</b> <b>arrangements</b> can first be implemented, which will allow for local innovation, flexibility, and development in social, economic, and political arenas. There is no institutional blueprint for Unger, however, only a direction that can be pointed to and general proposals that can be implemented to allow further institutional innovation and experimentation. Unger's guiding principle is that institutional flexibility needs to be built into the implemented system, {{and in this way}} a diversity of local experiments would take hold the world over.|$|E

25|$|This {{early work}} in {{historical}} analysis {{of law and}} legal thought laid the basis for Unger's contribution to the Critical Legal Studies movement. The movement itself {{was born in the}} late 1970s among young legal scholars at Harvard Law School who denounced the theoretical underpinnings of American jurisprudence, legal realism. The participants were committed to shaping society based on a vision of human personality without the hidden interests and class domination of legal institutions. Two tendencies of the movement developed, one, a radical indeterminacy that criticized law as meaning anything we want it to mean, and the other, a neo-Marxist critique that attacked legal thought as an institutional form of capitalism. Unger offered a third tendency, a constructive vision of rethinking rights based on individual emancipation and empowerment, and <b>structural</b> <b>arrangements</b> that would lend themselves to constant revision with the goal of creating more educational and economic opportunities for more people. He laid this out in The Critical Legal Studies Movement, which quickly earned him a following as the philosophical mentor and prophet of the movement.|$|E

40|$|It is {{estimated}} that 22 % of the worlds remaining petroleum resources {{are located in the}} Arctic region and 88 % are located offshore. To produce these resources is it needed with equipment that can handle the environmental conditions in the Arctic, since it can be really harsh and very vulnerable at the same time. With increasing activity in this area new concepts and designs of vessels are needed. This and {{the fact that there are}} developed new rule requirements for ships for operation in ice-infested waters, increase the necessity of comparison of different ice classes and the identification of the most optimum <b>structural</b> <b>arrangement</b> regarding weight for the different ice classes for ships that are going to operate in the Arctic. In this thesis has it been developed a tool that utilizes a Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm in the search after the optimum <b>structural</b> <b>arrangement</b> for different ice classes. The tool compares ice classes for the two different rule sets DNV Vessels for Arctic and Icebreaking Service and IACS unified requirement (URI 1 -URI 3) Polar Class and in the same time identifies the most optimum <b>structural</b> <b>arrangement</b> for each class. The tool has been used to do a comparison on both a platform supply vessel and an oil tanker to be able to see if there are any differences in ice classification between different types of vessels and in the choice of ice class and to show that the tool can be used for any type of vessel. The results for each comparison have been presented and compared, and the results show that the sensitivity in the choice of <b>structural</b> <b>arrangement</b> for an ice class and what ice class that is the lightest will differ from the type of the vessel and to what ice class that is chosen. It is in example shown that for the oil tanker that ice class PC- 5 will be heavier than ICE- 10, but for the platform supply vessel is it shown that ICE- 10 are heavier than PC- 5. This means that the necessity of a tool that can do a quick and accurate comparison of ice classes like the tool developed in this thesis are important. Especially in the early phase in development of a new design that needs a quick and accurate estimation of the hull structural weight and an indication of what the most optimum <b>structural</b> <b>arrangement</b> would be. </p...|$|R
