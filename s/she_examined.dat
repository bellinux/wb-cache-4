5|$|In 1942, Wheeler {{recruited}} Way {{to work on}} the Manhattan Project at the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. Working with physicist Alvin Weinberg, Way analyzed {{neutron flux}} data from Enrico Fermi's early nuclear reactor designs to see whether {{it would be possible to}} create a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction. These calculations were put to use in the construction of Chicago Pile-1. Afterwards, <b>she</b> <b>examined</b> the problem of nuclear poisoning of reactors by certain fission products. With physicist Eugene Wigner she developed the Way-Wigner approximation for fission product decay.|$|E

In 1960, Morgan {{was a member of}} a committee that looked at the toxicity of pesticides used in agriculture. She co-authored a textbook, Experimental Food Study, with Irene Sanborn Hall, and she wrote detailed histories of the Alpha Nu and Iota Sigma Pi honor societies.|$|E
5|$|At this point, Murray had no {{experience}} in field archaeology, and so during the 1902–03 field season, she travelled to Egypt to join Petrie's excavations at Abydos. Petrie and his wife, Hilda Petrie, had been excavating at the site since 1899, having taken over the archaeological investigation from French Coptic scholar Émile Amélineau. Murray at first joined as site nurse, but was subsequently taught how to excavate by Petrie and given a senior position. This led to some issues {{with some of the}} male excavators, who disliked the idea of taking orders from a woman. This experience, coupled with discussions with other female excavators (some of whom were active in the feminist movement) led Murray to adopt openly feminist viewpoints. While excavating at Abydos, Murray uncovered the Osireion, a temple devoted to the god Osiris which had been constructed by order of Pharaoh Seti I during the period of the New Kingdom. She published her site report as The Osireion at Abydos in 1904; in the report, <b>she</b> <b>examined</b> the inscriptions that had been discovered at the site to discern the purpose and use of the building.|$|E

In 1878 and 1879 <b>she</b> <b>examined</b> {{a large number of}} staple groceries for the state. The results of her investigation were published in the first annual report of the Board of Health, Lunacy and Charity, which had succeeded the earlier Board of Health.|$|E
25|$|Chatterji {{joined the}} {{teaching}} {{staff of the}} CIIS in 1997, and taught Social and Cultural Anthropology there. Her social and academic advocacy work was related to anthropology, since <b>she</b> <b>examined</b> issues of class, gender, race, religion, and sexuality as they are formed by background (history) and place (geography). She employed novel, experimental methodologies, including genealogy, archaeology and applied participatory research. At CIIS, she worked with her colleague and partner Richard Shapiro {{to create a new}} academic center focused on postcolonial anthropology.|$|E
25|$|Kristen R. Ghodsee (born April 26, 1970) is an American ethnographer and a Professor of Gender and Women's Studies at Bowdoin College, known {{primarily}} for her ethnographic work on post-communist Bulgaria {{as well as}} being a contributor to the field of postsocialist gender studies. Contrary to the prevailing opinion of most feminist scholars in the 1990s who believed that women would be disproportionately harmed by the collapse of communism, Ghodsee argued that many East European women would actually fare better than men in newly competitive labor markets because of the cultural capital that they had acquired before 1989. She was critical of the role of Western feminist nongovernmental organizations doing work among East European women in the 1990s. <b>She</b> <b>examined</b> the shifting gender relations of Muslim minorities after communism, and the intersections of Islamic beliefs and practices with the ideological remains of Marxism-Leninism.|$|E

500|$|Gowing {{was based}} at Linacre College. Her appointment, Roy MacLeod wrote, [...] "struck a {{conspicuous}} blow for modern, as against medieval and early modern, science, {{and for a}} reading of history that favoured social, economic and political perspectives, as against the examination of scientific practice." [...] She delivered her inaugural lecture, What's Science to History or History to Science?, on 27 May 1975. In this lecture, <b>she</b> <b>examined</b> {{the reasons why the}} history of science had grown apart from other forms of history, and endeavoured to reconcile them and bring them together again. In her subsequent Wilkins Lecture in 1976 <b>she</b> <b>examined</b> the history of British prejudice against science dating back to Victorian times.|$|E
500|$|At {{a conference}} in New York in 1938, Way {{presented}} a paper, [...] "Nuclear Quadrupole and Magnetic Moments", in which <b>she</b> <b>examined</b> deformation of a spinning atomic nucleus under three models, including Niels Bohr's liquid drop model. She followed this up with a closer examination of the liquid drop model in a paper entitled [...] "The Liquid-Drop Model and Nuclear Moments", in which she showed that the resulting cigar-shaped nucleus could be unstable.

2500|$|Gaga {{described}} Artpop as [...] "a {{celebration and}} a poetic musical journey" [...] that displayed a [...] "lack of maturity and responsibility", {{contrary to the}} dark, anthemic nature of Born This Way, ultimately subscribing to what she called a [...] "reverse Warholian" [...] formula. In an August 2013 interview, she told V magazine that she underwent a [...] "cosmetic experience with words" [...] as <b>she</b> <b>examined</b> potential names for the project. [...] "Popart" [...] was initially favored and taken into consideration, but as Gaga questioned [...] "the cultural implication of the words" [...] and the title's evolution post-release, she soon found a [...] "nice ring" [...] to [...] "Artpop". With Artpop, Gaga attempts to inject vulnerability into her work; Pierrot and Sandro Botticelli's The Birth of Venus painting have both been cited as muses of the singer's creative vision. Gaga admitted to being increasingly self-conscious {{at the apex of}} the Born This Way era, and when asked about the decision to refine her image, she responded: ...|$|E
2500|$|In her {{reporting}} of the 1961 [...] trial for The New Yorker, which evolved into [...] (1963), she coined the phrase [...] "the banality of evil" [...] {{to describe the}} phenomenon of [...] <b>She</b> <b>examined</b> {{the question of whether}} evil is radical or simply a function of thoughtlessness, a tendency of ordinary people to obey orders and conform to mass opinion without a critical evaluation of the consequences of their actions. She was sharply critical of the way the trial was conducted in Israel. She also was critical of the way that some Jewish leaders, notably , acted during the Holocaust. This caused a considerable controversy and even animosity toward Arendt in the Jewish community. Her friend , a major scholar of Jewish mysticism, broke off relations with her. Arendt was criticized by many Jewish public figures, who charged her with coldness and lack of sympathy for the victims of the Holocaust. Because of this lingering criticism, neither this book nor any of her other works were translated into Hebrew until 1999. This controversy was answered by Hannah Arendt in the book's Postscript.|$|E
2500|$|Canavan's {{research}} {{focused on}} the effects of nervous system damage on the mind and body. She was also very interested in bacteriology; the first of the 79 articles she published was on bacillary dysentery and the first article she co-authored with Southard concerned bacterial invasions of blood and cerebrospinal fluid. She studied the pathology of diseases affecting the optic nerve, spleen, brain, and spinal cord, and <b>she</b> <b>examined</b> cases of sudden death, multiple sclerosis, and microscopic hemorrhage. By prior agreement, she performed the autopsy on Frank Bunker Gilbreth, identifying the arteriosclerosis that had caused his death. And in 1925 she published Elmer Ernest Southard and His Parents: A Brain Study, a report on her examination of the brains of her mentor and his parents. She also trained neuropathologist Louise Eisenhardt, who became a renowned expert in diagnosing brain tumors. In 1959 she was credited with training 70% of the neurosurgeons then certified. She had a particular interest in the neuropathology of mental illness. With Southard and others, she contributed to a monograph series called Waverley [...] Researches in the Pathology of the Feeble-Minded.|$|E
5000|$|Wallace {{incorporates}} {{the use of}} images, video, and mixed media in her work {{in an effort to}} explore alterity, the study of otherness and the focus on dismantling the concept of sameness.

Fontaine examined three pieces of duct tape found on Caylee's remains for fingerprints, and said she did not find fingerprints but did not expect to, given the months the tape and the remains had been outdoors and exposed to the elements, stressing that any oil or sweat from a person's fingertips would have long since deteriorated. Though Fontaine showed the findings to her supervisor, she did not initially try to photograph the heart-shaped adhesive, explaining, [...] "When I observe something is unexpected, I note it and continue with my examination." [...] During the defense's cross-examination, Fontaine explained that when <b>she</b> <b>examined</b> the sticker evidence a second time, after subjecting the tape to dye testing, [...] "It was no longer visible." [...] She said that other FBI agents had tested the duct tape in the interim.|$|E
2500|$|Ada {{was often}} ill, {{beginning}} in early childhood. At {{the age of}} eight, she experienced headaches that obscured her vision. In June 1829, she was paralysed after a bout of measles. She was subjected to continuous bed rest for nearly a year, which may have extended her period of disability. By 1831, {{she was able to}} walk with crutches. Despite being ill Ada developed her mathematical and technological skills. At age 12 this future [...] "Lady Fairy", as Charles Babbage affectionately called her, decided she wanted to fly. Ada went about the project methodically, thoughtfully, with imagination and passion. Her first step, in February 1828, was to construct wings. She investigated different material and sizes. She considered various materials for the wings: paper, oilsilk, wires, and feathers. <b>She</b> <b>examined</b> the anatomy of birds to determine the right proportion between the wings and the body. She decided to write a book, Flyology, illustrating, with plates, some of her findings. She decided what equipment she would need; for example, a compass, to [...] "cut across the country by the most direct road", so that she could surmount mountains, rivers, and valleys. Her final step was to integrate steam with the [...] "art of flying".|$|E
2500|$|The Concepcion {{decision}} also impacted {{the usage}} of arbitration clauses in consumer contracts, including {{the usage of}} [...] "consumer-friendly" [...] arbitration terms like the ones in AT's agreement. [...] Jean Sternlight said that the Concepcion decision would cause businesses to include arbitration clauses with class action waivers, saying that the Concepcion decision removed the possibility of [...] "costly litigation" [...] over whether such terms are enforceable. [...] In a 2012 research paper, Gilles wrote that the majority opinion in Concepcion led to a [...] "race to the top" [...] in implementing arbitration procedures that are more friendly to consumer claims {{and more likely to}} allow their vindication. [...] Gilles wrote that corporate lawyers encouraged companies to implement terms similar to the ones used by AT Mobility and upheld in Concepcion. [...] According to Gilles, many large consumer-oriented businesses changed their arbitration provisions in 2011 and 2012. [...] However, Gilles noted that only 6 out of the 37 companies <b>she</b> <b>examined</b> had arbitration clauses that [...] "offered anything close to AT's set of incentives, and none were quite as generous". [...] Ann Marie Tracey and Shelley McGill wrote that businesses would introduce more consumer-unfriendly terms in their arbitration clauses since unconscionability [...] "provided strong motivation for business to draft agreements fairly in the pre-Concepcion environment; that motivation does not exist in the post-Concepcion era." [...] Suzanna Sherry said that the broad holding of the decision would make harsh arbitration clauses, similar to the earliest consumer arbitration clauses, enforceable, since the unconscionability doctrine that had been used to strike down those harsh clauses could be found preempted based on Concepcion.|$|E
