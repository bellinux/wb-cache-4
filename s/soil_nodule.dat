The composting is recognized as a suitable method for sludge recycling [...] The effect of tannery sludge compost (TSC) rates on growth, nodulation and N fixation of cowpea was investigated. Sandy and clayey soils were amended with TSC at rates of 0, 7. 5, 15, 30, and 60 t ha- 1. The shoot dry weight of cowpea plants 45 days after emergence (DAE) was greater in the TSC-amended than in the unamended soil. In the sandy <b>soil,</b> <b>nodule</b> dry weight increased with TSC application 45 DAE. In the clayey soil, 45 DAE, nodule dry weight decreased with TSC amendment levels greater than 7. 5 t ha- 1 compared to the unamended control. The application of TSC increased N accumulation in the cowpea plants. The results suggest that cowpea responds differently to TSC depending on the amendment rate and initial soil type...|$|E

40|$|Aim: Understanding the {{interactions}} between invasive legumes and soil biota in both native and introduced ranges could assist in managing biological invasions. We analysed the diversity of putative nitrogen-fixing bacteria (NFB, i. e. nifH gene present) associated with five invasive legumes, four Acacia spp. and a sister taxon Paraserianthes lophantha in introduced and native range populations in Australia. We predicted that, because these host species are widely distributed, {{they are likely to}} encounter different nitrogen-fixing bacterial communities in <b>soils</b> and <b>nodules</b> across their introduced and native ranges. Location: Australia. Methods: NifH genes were amplified from rhizosphere soils collected from beneath each species (multiple populations) within their native and introduced range and directly from nodules collected from plants previously grown in the glasshouse using field-collected soil as inoculum. NifH gene sequences from <b>soils</b> and <b>nodules</b> were 454 pyrosequenced and assigned to taxonomic groups based on nifH consensus taxonomy. Results: We found no difference in the NFB community of <b>soils</b> or <b>nodules</b> between native and introduced ranges across the five species, suggesting that these legumes encounter similar NFB communities in soils across Australia. Bradyrhizobium was the most abundant rhizobial genus present in both <b>soils</b> and <b>nodules.</b> Bradyrhizobium species found in nodules were significantly different across the ranges for A. longifolia. Main conclusions: The results indicate that these invasive legumes have similar nitrogen-fixing bacterial communities in their rhizosphere and nodules across Australia, with the exception of A. longifolia. This species has diverse Bradyrhizobium genotypes in its nodules suggesting that A. longifolia may be a more generalist host compared to the other four legumes. Thus, {{it is unlikely that the}} invasive success of these legumes is constrained by the absence of suitable bacterial symbionts in soil. Better knowledge of legume–soil interactions could facilitate more informed and effective management of invasive legumes in their introduced ranges in Australia and elsewhere. 14 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Fires occur {{frequently}} {{over large}} parts of the Earth’s surface. They potentially exert a significant influence on the mineralogical and geochemical characteristics of an environment that is otherwise considered to be dominated by low temperature processes. We test this hypothesis by comparing the mineralogy and geochemistry of (i) magnetic, iron-rich <b>soil</b> <b>nodules,</b> (ii) non-magnetic iron <b>soil</b> <b>nodules</b> and (iii) a published dataset of surficial sediments from eastern Australia. Maghemite-rich nodules are present in soils from around the world. It has been argued that they are thermal alteration products of non-magnetic precursors, but this remains controversial. We use detailed petrographic and mineralogical analyses to demonstrate that maghemite occurs as part of a high temperature mineral assemblage including hematite and χ-alumina, within a magnetic nodule microfabric indicative of fire-induced dehydroxylation and sintering of non-magnetic precursors at temperatures of up to 600 °C. The genetic link between magnetic and non-magnetic nodules means that their comparison offers insights into the geochemical impact of fire. Our results show that magnetic nodules are depleted in Si, Y, Zr and HREE but enriched in Fe and Cr relative to non-magnetic nodules that occur in close spatial proximity. Magnetic nodules also show variable but distinctly low Y/Ho (21. 4 ± 0. 4) and Zr/Hf (29. 3 ± 0. 8) as well as anomalously low La relative to the other LREE. In situ laser ablation analyses show that this is largely due to the presence of χ-alumina that is depleted in HREEs and has extremely low Y/Ho (mainly < 20), as well as the low Zr/Hf of χ-alumina and the maghemite-hematite matrix, with no involvement from zircon. We propose a multi-stage process of formation where fire transforms non-magnetic nodule precursors into proto-magnetic nodules. This is associated with thermal transformation of clays as well as Fe and Al oxyhydroxides, followed by isochemical segregation into a sintered core with low Si, Y/Ho, Zr/Hf and La/Gd and a reciprocal cortex. Preferential loss of the weathering-sensitive cortex, which is rarely preserved on the magnetic nodules, then results in geochemical differentiation of magnetic nodules relative to their non-magnetic precursors. We propose that the elevated Zr/Hf and Y/Ho ratios previously reported for Australian fluvial sediments reflect, at least in part, the long history of palaeo-fires in the catchments of these rivers, with preferential removal, transport and sedimentation of the readily weathered, high Y/Ho and Zr/Hf cortex material that is a product of thermal alteration of Fe nodules. In addition, since magnetic Fe nodules are demonstrably related to fire, they may represent a promising, directly dateable record of severe fires, which can complement the sedimentary charcoal record...|$|R

Both strains formed more infections in autoclaved soil (sterile soil) than in untreated soil (unsterile soil). Inoculation did not increase numbers of infection threads in unsterile soil-grown plants, where infection of proximal portions of primary roots was complete by 5 days after planting. Both strains infected and nodulated at similar rates in sterile <b>soil.</b> <b>Nodules</b> were always clustered on the upper root system, regardless of inoculation and soil treatment.

H. erectus fossils occur from {{the upper part of}} the Sangiran Fm. to the middle to upper Bapang Fm. Soil samples and carbonate nodules were collected from paleosols within the Sangiran and Bapang Fms. and freshwater mollusk shells were collected from the upper Sangiran Fm. The upper Sangiran Fm. has a fossil assemblage and sediment and paleosol characteristics indicating a paludal to lacustrine depositional environment, while the Bapang Fm. is sandy braided stream deposit with multiple fining upward cycles. The Bapang Fm. yields {{a variety of}} mammalian fossils yet contains no freshwater mollusks. Freshwater mollusks and <b>soil</b> carbonate <b>nodules</b> associated with H. erectus fossils from the Solo Basin provide a direct measure of riparian vegetation approximately 1. 66 to 1. 5 Ma. These carbonates consistently have delta (super 13) C values that are approximately 10 to 11 per mil higher than associated plant organic matter. The first occurrence of H. erectus in the Upper Sangiran Fm. coincides with wet conditions and C 4 plant carbon isotope ratios. The last occurrence of H. erectus in the Bapang Fm. coincides with dry conditions and a C 3 plant carbon isotope ratios. The transition from C 4 to C 3 values occurs gradually within the lower portion of the Bapang Fm. after the depositional environment has changed. Modern mollusks collected from local streams have a C 3 signal similar to the upper portion of the Bapang Fm. Modern conditions are controlled by monsoonal rainfall with pronounced dry and rainy seasons. The dry season (May-Oct.) occurs when the ITCZ shifts to the north and dry air masses off Australia dominate. The rainy season (Nov. to April) occurs when the ITCZ shifts southward and humid air masses off SE Asia dominate. We conclude that the transition from C 4 to C 3 plants in the Solo Basin occurred when the ITCZ shifted northward (perhaps during a transition from a glacial to interglacial).

In most studies, little attention is payed {{to the effect of}} calcic <b>nodules</b> on <b>soil</b> evaporation and ecoenvironment, resulting in inaccurate evaporation estimation in this kind of soil and further improper field water management measures and irrigation effects. In this paper, soil column experiments were conducted in order to investigate evaporation process in <b>soil</b> containing calcic <b>nodules</b> and the effect of calcic <b>nodules</b> on <b>soil</b> evaporation was determined. The results indicated that evaporation reduction was positively related to calcic nodule content (CNC = mass of calcic nodules/total mass), and could be estimated by the experiential equation: E(soil) = E(0) (1 - 0. 4 CNC) (E(soil) = actual evaporation, E(0) = theory evaporation in <b>soil</b> without calcic <b>nodules).</b> When CNC was below 0. 2, the impact could be neglected. While, as CNC exceeded 0. 2, the impact needed to be considered during soil evaporation estimation. As CNC reached 0. 5, soil evaporation could be reduced by 7. 5 mm, accounting for around 10 % of the total soil water. Water balance calculation in soil columns showed that water absorbed by calcic nodules was partially available to evaporation. Water available to evaporation was positively related to CNC, and this water could not exceed 63 % of the water absorbed by calcic nodules. Generally, evaporation behavior was dominated by calcic nodule quantity and its water absorption. These results provide new ideas for irrigation measures in arid areas of the globe...|$|R

Using XRD, SEM, EMPA and PIXE analyses, it is shown that {{trace elements}} are located within porous heterogeneous fluor-apatite nodules, which contain inclusions of goethite, quartz, and minor rutile. Within nodules, trace elements are not randomly distributed but associated with the goethite phase. From Eh-pH diagrams, under pH soil conditions (pH = 6), arsenic is certainly present as H 2 AsO 4 -, in solutions, i. e. with trivalent arsenic. Therefore the high arsenic concentrations, up to 8500 ppm, associated with goethite, can be due either to adsorption of the H 2 AsO 4 - species, to the precipitation of an As 3 +-rich phase, or to the unlikely simple Fe 3 + - As 3 + substitution in the goethite structure. Desorption experiments have been performed with a KH 2 PO 4 solution on hand-picked goethite grains. This phosphate solution has been chosen to provoke phosphorus to arsenic exchange on goethite, owing to the well-known affinity of phosphorus with the goethite surface. Using a 1. 33 M solution and a solid/solution weight ratio of 2. 5, it is observed that less than 1 The same Eh-pH considerations indicate that the other trace elements are present under the divalent state.

Nodule infectivity {{was determined by}} multiple intrinsic antibiotic resistance, since both fast-growing strains were sensitive. Different hydrogen uptake (Hup) efficiencies of dual-strain inocula allowed for the comparison of an indirect rapid method. Infectivity data based on antibiotic resistance and Hup efficiency were fit to linearized fractile plots of log-normal distributions to determine CAB (percent infectivity at a 1 : 1 inoculum density) or I 50 (inoculum ratio at 50 % infectivity). The slow growers were always better competitors and had I 50 values which ranged from 7 to 160, 000 and CAB values which ranged from 62 to 97 %. P 132 was the best competitor of all those tested. Antibiotic resistance and Hup efficiency methods were in agreement with 401 (Hup−) and 176 A 26 (Hup+), but the Hup efficiency method overestimated the I 50 index with 22 A 1 (Hup−) and 176 A 28 (Hup+).

Nodule occupancy over the four site-years on the cultivars Corsoy 79 and Williams 82 ranged from 3. 8 to 13. 3 %. Both cultivars responded to N fertilizer with higher yields than the noninoculated controls, which indicated that the native slow-growers were not fixing all the N needed for maximum growth of the plants.

Twenty-one genomic species {{were characterized by}} small-subunit ribosomal DNA PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism and phylogenetic analyses, among 745 rhizobial strains isolated from nodules sampled on 32 different legume host species at 12 sites. Among these rhizobial genomic species, 16 belonged to the Bradyrhizobium subgroup, 2 to the Rhizobium leguminosarum subgroup, and 3 to the Mesorhizobium subgroup. Only one genomic species corresponded to a known species (Rhizobium tropici). The distribution of the various genomic species was highly unbalanced among the 745 isolates, legume hosts, and sites. Bradyrhizobium species were {{by far the most}} abundant, and Rhizobium tropici dominated among the Rhizobium and Mesorhizobium isolates in the generally acid <b>soils</b> where <b>nodules</b> were collected. Although a statistically significant association occurred between the eight most common genomic species and the 32 hosts, there was sufficient overlap in distributions that no clear specificity between rhizobial genomic species and legume taxa was observed. However, for three legume species, some preference for particular genomic species was suggested. Similarly, no geographical partitioning was found...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} several biotic and abiotic factors on {{the pattern of}} {{competition}} between two strains of Rhizobium japonicum was examined. In two Minnesota soils, Waseca and Waukegan, strain USDA 123 occupied 69 % (Waseca) and 24 % (Waukegan) of the root nodules on Glycine max L. Merrill cv. Chippewa. USDA 110 occupied 2 % of the root nodules in the Waseca soil and 12 % of the nodules in the Waukegan soil. Under {{a variety of other}} growth conditions—vermiculite, vermiculite amended with Waseca soil, and two Hawaiian soils devoid of naturalized Rhizobium japonicum strains—USDA 110 was more competitive than USDA 123. The addition of nitrate to or the presence of antibiotic-producing actinomycetes in the rhizosphere of soybeans did not affect the pattern of competition between the two strains. However, preexposure of young seedings to USDA 110 or USDA 123 before transplantation into soil altered the pattern of competition between the two strains significantly. In the Waseca soil, preexposure of cv. Chippewa to USDA 110 for 72 h increased the percentage of nodules occupied by USDA 110 from 2 to 55 %. Similarly, in the Hawaiian <b>soil</b> Waimea, <b>nodule</b> occupancy by USDA 123 increased from 7 to 33 % after a 72 -h preexposure...|$|R
40|$|The {{excessive}} {{concentrations of}} toxic heavy metals in mine tailings and their very low N content make soil reclamation strategies by phytostabilization difficult. Our {{objective was to}} test if the symbiotic association between the legume Anthyllis vulneraria subsp. carpatica and the bacteria Mesorhizobium metallidurans originating from highly polluted mine tailings is able to increase N concentration in soils with contrasting Zn, Pb and Cd contents. Plants of A. vulneraria subsp. carpatica from a mine site and of a non-metallicolous subsp. praeopera from non-polluted soil were inoculated with a metallicolous or a non-metallicolous compatible Mesorhizobium spp. and grown on low and high heavy metal-contaminated soils. In contaminated <b>soil,</b> many <b>nodules</b> were observed when the metallicolous A. vulneraria was inoculated with its rhizobium species M. metallidurans, whereas the non-metallicolous A. vulneraria died {{after a few weeks}} regardless of the rhizobium inoculant. Eighty percent of the total nitrogen was derived from biological nitrogen fixation through the association between metallicolous A. vulneraria and the rhizobium grown on metal-enriched soil. The ability of the metallicolous A. vulneraria to develop a high nitrogen fixing potential opens new possibilities for promoting a low-maintenance plant cover and for stabilizing the vegetation in high heavy metal-contaminated soils.

40|$|Sequences of nodD, a gene {{found only}} in rhizobia, were amplified from total {{community}} DNA isolated from a pasture soil. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers used, Y 5 and Y 6, match nodD from Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar trifolii, R. leguminosarum biovar viciae and Sinorhizobium meliloti. The PCR product was cloned and yielded 68 clones that were identified by restriction pattern as derived from biovar trifolii [11 {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP) types] and 15 clones identified as viciae (seven RFLP types). These identifications were confirmed by sequencing. There were no clones related to S. meliloti nodD. For comparison, 122 strains were isolated from nodules of white clover (Trifolium repens) growing at the field site, and 134 from nodules on trap plants of T. repens inoculated with the <b>soil.</b> The <b>nodule</b> isolates were of four nodD RFLP types, with 77 % being of a single type. All four of these patterns were also found among the clones from soil DNA, and the same type was the most abundant, although it made up only 34 % of the trifolii-like clones. We conclude that clover selects specific genotypes from the available soil population, and that R. leguminosarum biovar trifolii was approximately five times more abundant than biovar viciae in this pasture soil, whereas S. meliloti was rare...|$|R

40|$|H 2 evolved by alfalfa root nodules {{during the}} process of N 2 {{fixation}} may be an important factor influencing the distribution of soil bacteria. To test this hypothesis under field conditions, over 700 bacterial isolates were obtained from fallow soil or from the 3 -mm layer of soil surrounding alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) root nodules, alfalfa roots, or bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis L.) roots. Bacteria were isolated under either aerobic or microaerophilic conditions and were tested for their capacity to metabolize H 2. Isolates showing net H 2 uptake and 3 H 2 incorporation activity under laboratory conditions were assigned a Hup+ phenotype, whereas organisms with significant H 2 output capacity were designated as a Hout+ phenotype. Under aerobic isolation conditions two Hup+ isolates were obtained, whereas under microaerophilic conditions five Hup+ and two Hout+ isolates were found. The nine isolates differed on the basis of 24 standard bacteriological characteristics or fatty acid composition. Five of the nine organisms were isolated from <b>soil</b> around root <b>nodules,</b> whereas the other four were found distributed among the other three soil environments. On the basis of the microaerophilic isolations, 4. 8 % of the total procaryotic isolates from <b>soil</b> around root <b>nodules</b> were capable of oxidizing H 2, and 1. 2 % could produce H 2. Two of the Hup+ isolates were identified as Rhizobium meliloti by root nodulation tests, but the fact that none of the isolates reduced C 2 H 2 under the assay conditions suggested that the H 2 metabolism traits were associated with various hydrogenase systems rather than with nitrogenase activity. Results from this study support the concept that H 2 evolution by alfalfa root nodules has a significant effect on the surrounding microenvironment and influences the number and diversity of bacteria occupying that region...|$|R
5000|$|Loess {{deposits}} {{with lime}} nodules {{are found in}} the illuvial horizons of soils that formed on loess and loess-like loams. In the <b>soil</b> profile, the <b>nodules</b> stand out as bright spots with a clear and rounded shape. The size of spots is 1-2 cm in diameter, which is comparable to the size of an eye, and, more specifically, to that of the species of birds known as White-eye. Thus, the name [...] "White-eye" [...] for loess with lime nodules may have been derived from their comparison to these birds. Unlike other forms of carbonate nodules, which are often found in more solid rock, loess deposits with lime nodules are soft and crumbly, or loose. The German word for loose is Loess; it was first used in about 1821 in reference to the Rhine River loess.|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} {{paper is}} {{a study on the}} interaction between Lupinus angustifolius L. and N 2 -fixing nodulating bacteria in selected Swedish soils. Bacteria being able to induce N 2 -fixing symbiotic root nodules on legume plants are generally called rhizobia. The main objectives were to investigate (1) the presence of rhizobia compatible with two cultivars of L. angustifolius, Bora and Galant in an agricultural soil in Skåne and a soil in Uppsala where the perennial lupin L. polyphyllus is growing, (2) the development of lupin root nodules, (3) taxonomic identity of the nodulating rhizobia using DNA sequencing and (4) effects of various pre-treatments of the inoculum as well as seed treatments on the nodule formation in L. angustifolius. Two experiments were conducted by growing plants in controlled light and temperature during May to August 2010, in the growth rooms at the Department of Plant Biology and Forest Genetics, SLU. The Skåne agricultural soil and the Uppsala perennial lupin <b>soil</b> induced <b>nodules</b> in both cultivars. The number of nodules per plant using a seed dipping inoculation technique was similar for both soils. However, in the experiment where soil suspension was added as inoculum to the pot the number of nodules was lower for the perennial soil suggesting that mineral nitrogen or another <b>soil</b> factor inhibited <b>nodule</b> formation. Using a method where seeds were inoculated by dipping into the soil suspension, the effect of drying soil in room temperature before use as inoculum and the effect of time after germination on nodule formation were investigated. Fresh soil induced a higher number of nodules in L. angustifolius than the dry soil indicating a decline of the infective population size or diversity in the dry soil. Seeds sterilized immediately prior to inoculation and seeds germinated for one day gave plants with higher nodule number compared to seeds germinated for two days. Sequences of a part of the 16 S- 23 S internal transcribed spacer showed that the nitrogen fixing rhizobium of both soils had highest identity to Bradyrhizobium sp in the B. japonicum group. However, a phylogenetic analysis showed good separation of the two clusters formed by the rhizobia of the two soils suggesting that the Bradyrhizobium sp in the Skåne agricultural soils is genetically different from that in the Uppsala perennial lupin soil...|$|R
40|$|Elemental {{composition}} and geochemical characteristics of iron-manganese nodules from nine main soils in China were studied by chemical and multivariate statistical analyses {{to better understand}} the reactions and functions of iron-manganese <b>nodules</b> in <b>soils</b> and sediment. Compared to the corresponding soils, Mn, Ba, Cd, Co and Pb had strong accumulation, Ni had moderate accumulation, while Ca, Cu, Fe, Na, P, Sr and Zn accumulated to a minor degree in the iron-manganese nodules. In contrast, Si, Al, K, Mg and Ti were reduced in the iron-manganese nodules. The contents of Ba, Cd, Co, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn were positively and significantly correlated with that of MnO 2 in the iron-manganese nodules, while the contents of Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn were positively and significantly correlated with that of Fe 2 O 3 in soils. Based on a principle component analysis, the elements of iron-manganese nodules were divided into four groups: 1) Mn, Ba, Cd, Co, Cu, Li, Ni, Pb and Zn that were associated with Mn oxides, 2) Fe, Cr and P that were associated with Fe oxides, 3) Si, K, and Mg that were included in the elemental composition of phyllosilicate, and 4) Ca, Na, Al and Ti that existed in todorokite, birnessite, lithiophorite and phyllosilicate.
