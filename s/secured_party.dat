25|$|In {{situations}} where the liquidation value of the assets exceeds a secured creditor's lien, the assignee is not normally required to obtain the consent of a secured creditor or any other creditor prior to the assignment process. Cooperation of the secured creditor may however affect the assignee's ability to liquidate an asset. An assignee in practice may obtain {{the consent of the}} secured creditors in advance of the assignment to ensure that the assignee can liquidate the asset or assets in a timely manner without a <b>secured</b> <b>party</b> stopping or holding up the assignment process. <b>Secured</b> <b>party</b> consent in this case is optional, not necessary.|$|E
50|$|The {{property}} that secures the principal debt {{is referred to}} as the security object. The security parties are the debtor, known as the <b>secured</b> <b>party,</b> and the creditor, known as the security holder. Real security rights give the security holder the power to prevent the <b>secured</b> <b>party</b> from disposing of it, as well as a right of preference (ius praeferendi). Where the <b>secured</b> <b>party</b> is unwilling to repay the principal debt, or is insolvent, the security holder may, after the security object has been attached and sold in execution, claim the proceeds from that sale before any other creditor. Real security rights are limited real rights (or iura in re aliena, or rights in someone else’s property). They confer limited and specific entitlements on their holders and are enforceable against third parties.|$|E

50|$|A legal lien, in many {{common law}} systems, {{includes}} {{a right to}} retain physical possession of tangible assets as security for the underlying obligations. In some jurisdictions it {{is a form of}} possessory security, and possession of the assets must be transferred to (and maintained by) the <b>secured</b> <b>party.</b> In the case of a possessory lien, the right is purely passive. In the case of a possessory lien, the <b>secured</b> <b>party</b> (the lienor) has no right to sell the assets - merely a right to refuse to return them until paid. In the United States, a lien can be a non-possessory security interest.|$|E

50|$|There are {{a number}} of other {{arrangements}} which parties can put in place which have the effect of conferring security in a commercial sense, but do not actually create a proprietary security interest in the assets. For example, it is possible to grant a power of attorney or conditional option in favour of the <b>secured</b> <b>party</b> relating to the subject matter, or to utilise a retention of title arrangement, or execute undated transfer instruments. Whilst these techniques may provide protection for the <b>secured</b> <b>party,</b> they do not confer a proprietary interest in the assets which the arrangements relate to, and their effectiveness may be limited if the debtor goes into bankruptcy.|$|E
50|$|Foreclosure {{is rarely}} {{exercised}} as a remedy. To execute foreclosure, the <b>secured</b> <b>party</b> needs to petition the court, {{and the order}} is made in two stages (nisi and absolute), making the process slow and cumbersome. Courts are historically reluctant to grant orders for foreclosure, and will often instead order a judicial sale. If the asset {{is worth more than}} the secured obligations, the <b>secured</b> <b>party</b> will normally have to account for the surplus. Even if a court makes a decree absolute and orders foreclosure, the court retains an absolute discretion to reopen the foreclosure after the making of the order, although this would not affect the title of any third party purchaser.|$|E
50|$|To {{complete}} a legal mortgage it is normally necessary that {{title to the}} assets is conveyed into {{the name of the}} <b>secured</b> <b>party</b> such that the <b>secured</b> <b>party</b> (or its nominee) becomes the legal titleholder to the asset. If a legal mortgage is not completed in this manner it will normally take effect as an equitable mortgage. Because of the requirement to transfer title, {{it is not possible to}} take a legal mortgage over future property, or to take more than one legal mortgage over the same assets. However, mortgages (legal and equitable) are non-possessory security interests. Normally the party granting the mortgage (the mortgagor) will remain in possession of the mortgaged asset.|$|E

50|$|Security {{interests}} at common law are either possessory or nonpossessory, depending upon whether the <b>secured</b> <b>party</b> actually {{needs to take}} possession of the collateral.

5000|$|Unless {{otherwise}} agreed by the parties, a real security {{right is}} indivisible, securing the entire debt and binding the <b>secured</b> <b>party</b> (or debtor) {{until it is}} paid.

50|$|Fundamental {{concepts}} under Article 9 include how {{a security}} interest is created (called attachment); {{how to give}} notice of a security interest to the public, which makes the security interest enforceable against others who may claim {{an interest in the}} collateral (called perfection); when multiple claims to the same collateral exist, determining which interests prevail over others (called priority); and what remedies a <b>secured</b> <b>party</b> has if the debtor defaults in payment or performance of the secured obligation.|$|E
50|$|Generally speaking, an {{equitable}} mortgage {{has the same}} effect as a perfected legal mortgage except in two respects. Firstly, being {{an equitable}} right, it will be extinguished by a bona fide purchaser for value {{who did not have}} notice of the mortgage. Secondly, because the legal title to the mortgaged property is not actually vested in the <b>secured</b> <b>party,</b> it means that a necessary additional step is imposed in relation to the exercise of remedies such as foreclosure.|$|E

5000|$|Concerns {{were raised}} in this period about the {{influence}} of Emmanuel's organization over Conservative Party nominations in some ridings. In particular, his endorsement of three candidates at a rally in Kemptville, Nova Scotia was seen as helping those candidates <b>secure</b> <b>party</b> nominations in their ridings. Asked about the matter, Emmanuel said, [...] "It's time we stopped apologizing and started defending who we are. The evangelical community in Canada, by and large, and socially conservative Catholics, are saying we have been far too heavenly minded and thus we have been of no earthly value for far too long, on too many fronts." [...] He declined to say how many of his adherents had <b>secured</b> Conservative <b>Party</b> nominations, arguing that the media would portray his campaign as the infiltration of the party by [...] "right-wing fanatics." [...] He also stated that his group was non-partisan, and that he was not working as an agent of the Conservative Party.|$|R
50|$|Many legal liens arise as {{a matter}} of law (by common law or by statute). It is possible, however, to create a legal lien by contract.

5000|$|Hypothecation, or [...] "trust receipts" [...] are {{relatively}} uncommon forms of security interest whereby {{the underlying assets}} are pledged, not by delivery of the assets as in a conventional pledge, but by delivery of a document or other evidence of title.
