It is found that work overload is major reason of stress among employees and majority of employees reduce their productivity and loss of interest in job due to stress.

Materials and Methods Fiber reinforced composite EverX Posterior (EXP, GC EUROPE), and other commercially available bulk fill composites, including Filtek Bulk Fill (FB, 3 M ESPE), SonicFill (SF, Kerr Corp.), SureFil (SDR, Dentsply), Venus Bulk Fill (VB, HerausKultzer), Tetric evoceram bulk fill (TECB, Ivoclar Vivadent), and Xtra Base (XB, Voco) were characterized. Composite samples light-cured with a LED device were evaluated in terms of flexural strength, flexural modulus (ISO 4049, n = 6), fracture toughness (n = 6), and Vickers hardness (0, 2, and 4 mm in depth at 24 hr, n = 5). The EXP samples and the fracture surface were observed under a scanning electron microscopy. Data were statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA and unpaired t-test. Results EXP, FB, <b>and</b> VB <b>had</b> significantly higher fracture toughness value compared to all the other bulk composite types. SF, EXP, and XB were not <b>statistically</b> different, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> significantly higher flexural strength values compared to other tested composite materials.

This effect is more pronounced for net wages (see Eq. (11) for the analytical derivation). Our results show that the own-wage semi-elasticity of the probability of participation yields 0.13 for females and 0.09 for males.

This ensures the existence of saddle point feedback controls for the game with $N$ minor agents.
