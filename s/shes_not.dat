A southerly deviation of the Port Melbourne line was made between Clarendon and Inglis Streets to make way for two 5 ton travelling jib cranes, and Montague Street was extended northward under the tracks to compensate for the removal of the level crossing gates at Ferrars Street.

40|$|Observational {{evidence}} is presented of connections between tropical heating and circulation changes in subtropical and extratropical latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) {{in summer and}} winter, and the processes responsible for these interactions are described. The observational evidence suggests that, during <b>SH</b> summer (but <b>not</b> <b>SH</b> winter), both the acceleration of westerly winds south of the heating region through meridional overturnings and excitation of Rossby waves are possible. During winter, the enhanced tropical convective activity results again in local meridional overturning with zonal wind acceleration of Rossby waves farther south...|$|R

Rapunzels no-nonsense attitude and proactive air, however, reminds us that the blondes of yore were not to be trifled with. As reimagined in Tangled, Rapunzel defies authority, shuts down male ego and charts her own course. <b>Shes</b> <b>not</b> only a great role model for kids, shes the type of gutsy, independently minded, value-added blonde Mae West would have been proud of.

40|$|In {{founding}} {{a system}} which we wish to last for ages, we <b>shd.</b> <b>not</b> {{lose sight of the}} changes which ages will produce. ” —James Madison (June 26, 1787) 1 A view common today in scholarly and popular circles is that the Senate is broken. This implies that it is no longer serving the function for which it was created. As evidence, propo-nents point to the excessive minority obstruction and resulting gridlock on the Senate floor. Responsibility is assigned to the endemic partisan and ideological polarization of the current environment. The result is that nothing gets done. Put simply, the Senate is broken because it is unable to pass important legislation. These developments have led some scholars to argue that the contemporary Senate is an unproductive legislative body in need of reform precisely because it is unable expeditiously to confirm presidential nominations or approve public poli-cies to address society’s most pressing problems. Reflecting mounting bipartisan frustration with these challenges, Senate Republicans tried, and failed, to eliminate the filibuster for judicial nominations in 2005 and Senate Democrats tried, and succeeded, to eliminate the super-majoritarian vote threshold for some judicial and all executive branch nominations in 2013...|$|R
