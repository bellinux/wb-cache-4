A single medication is recommended initially; {{if this is not}} effective, switching to a single other medication is recommended. Two medications at once is recommended only if a single medication does not work. In about half, the first agent is effective; a second <b>single</b> <b>agent</b> helps in about 13% and a third or two agents at the same time may help an additional 4%.

5|$|The {{majority}} of cases of cholangiocarcinoma present as inoperable (unresectable) disease in which case patients are generally treated with palliative chemotherapy, with or without radiotherapy. Chemotherapy {{has been shown in}} a randomized controlled trial to improve quality of life and extend survival in patients with inoperable cholangiocarcinoma. There is no single chemotherapy regimen which is universally used, and enrollment in clinical trials is often recommended when possible. Chemotherapy agents used to treat cholangiocarcinoma include 5-fluorouracil with leucovorin, gemcitabine as a <b>single</b> <b>agent,</b> or gemcitabine plus cisplatin, irinotecan, or capecitabine.

40|$|Abstract. Multi-agent {{systems are}} a natural way of decomposing complex systems into more {{manageable}} and decentralized units. Nevertheless, as <b>single</b> <b>agents</b> can represent complex subsystems themselves, software engineering principles {{for the design}} and implementation of coherent parts of <b>single</b> <b>agents</b> are necessary for producing modular and reusable software artifacts. This paper picks up the formerly proposed capability concept for structuring BDI agents in functional clusters, and generalizes and extends it to support {{a higher degree of}} reusability. The resulting mechanism allows for designing and implementing BDI agents as a composition of configurable agent modules (capabilities). It is based on a black-box approach with export interfaces that is in line with objectoriented engineering principles. ...|$|R

25|$|Early {{clinical}} studies with protein-based therapeutics largely {{focused on the}} intravenous or intracoronary administration of a particular growth factor to stimulate angiogenesis in the affected tissue or organ. Most of these trials did not achieve statistically significant improvements in their clinical endpoints. This ultimately led to an abandonment of this approach and a widespread belief in the field that protein therapy, especially with a <b>single</b> <b>agent,</b> was not a viable option to treat ischemic cardiovascular disease. However, the failure of gene- or cell-based therapy to deliver a suitable treatment choice for diseases resulting from poor blood flow {{has led to a}} resurgence of interest in returning to protein-based therapy to stimulate angiogenesis.|$|E
25|$|Many low-grade lymphomas remain {{indolent}} {{for many}} years. Treatment of the nonsymptomatic patient is often avoided. In {{these forms of}} lymphoma, such as follicular lymphoma, watchful waiting is often the initial course of action. This is carried out because the harms and risks of treatment outweigh the benefits. If a low-grade lymphoma is becoming symptomatic, radiotherapy or chemotherapy are the treatments of choice; although they do not cure the lymphoma, they can alleviate the symptoms, particularly painful lymphadenopathy. Patients with these types of lymphoma can live near-normal lifespans, but the disease is incurable. Some centers advocate the use of <b>single</b> <b>agent</b> rituximab {{in the treatment of}} follicular lymphoma rather than the wait and watch approach. Watchful waiting is not a good strategy for all patients, as it leads to significant distress and anxiety in some patients. It has been equated with watch and worry.|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{evaluate}} which vasoactive {{agents have}} synergistic {{effects on the}} cavernosal smooth muscles of rabbits and rats when the agents are combined with sildenafil. Materials and methods Relaxation responses of cavernosal smooth muscle to <b>single</b> <b>agents</b> (phentolamine, moxisylyte, sodium nitroprusside, forskolin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, VIP, papaverine and sildenafil) in the rabbit, and prostaglandin-E 1 and sildenafil in the rat, and to combinations of each agent plus sildenafil, were assessed in vitro. The response to sildenafil of the rabbit strips with and without incubation with l-arginine (1 mmol/L) for 20 min was also evaluated. The effective concentrations for a half-maximal response of <b>single</b> <b>agents</b> and combination solutions were compared. Results All <b>single</b> <b>agents</b> induced concentration-dependent relaxation of the rabbit and rat cavernosal smooth muscles. There was significant synergism on rabbit cavernosal smooth muscle when the sildenafil was combined with forskolin, sodium nitroprusside, VIP or phentolamine. There was also significant synergism with sildenafil plus prostaglandin-E 1 in rat cavernosal muscles. There were no synergistic effects of combinations of sildenafil plus moxisylyte, papaverine or l-arginine.

25|$|In 1965, a major {{breakthrough}} in cancer therapy occurred. James F. Holland, Emil Freireich, and Emil Frei hypothesized that cancer chemotherapy should follow the strategy of antibiotic therapy for tuberculosis with combinations of drugs, each with a different mechanism of action. Cancer cells could conceivably mutate to become resistant to a <b>single</b> <b>agent,</b> but by using different drugs concurrently {{it would be more}} difficult for the tumor to develop resistance to the combination. Holland, Freireich, and Frei simultaneously administered methotrexate (an antifolate), vincristine (a Vinca alkaloid), 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and prednisone — together referred to as the POMP regimen — and induced long-term remissions in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). With incremental refinements of original regimens, using randomized clinical studies by St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, the Medical Research Council in the UK (UKALL protocols) and German Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster clinical trials group (ALL-BFM protocols), ALL in children has become a largely curable disease.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, many {{studies have shown that}} social {{networks}} are important to the economic progress and the development of societies. In order to explain the determinants of social network formation, {{it is important to understand}} the motivations characterising the decisions of <b>single</b> <b>agents</b> with respect to their social behaviour. This paper presents evidence, through Italian microdata representative of the entire Italian population, that the quality and quantity of interpersonal relations of agents can increase their economic welfare. The analysis proposed seems to indicate that individuals also have an economic incentive to invest in social relations. Two proxies of interpersonal relations at an individual level are used. The first one, that is considered as a proxy for formal social relations, reflects the propensity of individuals to participate in different groups. The second one, that is interpreted as a proxy for the informal social relations, reflects the level of satisfaction of personal relationships of <b>single</b> <b>agents</b> with friends. This proxy is very useful to capture the quantitative aspects of informal interpersonal relations and the qualitative ones. Both formal and informal social relations of <b>single</b> <b>agents</b> seem to have a positive effect on their level of household economic welfare. This result proves robust to the inclusion of a variety of control variables and the use of different econometric methods. social interactions, social relations and economic welfare...|$|R

60|$|Now, {{if such a}} cause {{will exist}} to-morrow, or at any future time, some cause, {{proximate}} or remote, of that cause must exist now, and must have existed during {{the whole of the}} five thousand years. If, therefore, the sun do not rise to-morrow, it will be because some cause has existed, the effects of which, though during five thousand years they have not amounted to a perceptible quantity, will in one day become overwhelming. Since this cause has not been recognized during such an interval of time by observers stationed on our earth, it must, if it be a <b>single</b> <b>agent,</b> be either one whose effects develop themselves gradually and very slowly, or one which existed in regions beyond our observation, and is now on the point of arriving in our part of the universe. Now all causes which we have experience of act according to laws incompatible with the supposition that their effects, after accumulating so slowly as to be imperceptible for five thousand years, should start into immensity in a single day. No mathematical law of proportion between an effect and the quantity or relations of its cause could produce such contradictory results. The sudden development of an effect of which there was no previous trace always arises from the coming together of several distinct causes, not previously conjoined; but if such sudden conjunction is destined to take place, the causes, or their causes, must have existed during the entire five thousand years; and their not having once come together during that period shows how rare that particular combination is.

60|$|The most skillfully combined, {{and with}} the {{greatest}} foresight of objections, of all the forms of Socialism is that commonly known as Fourierism.(157) This system does not contemplate the abolition of private property, nor even of inheritance: on the contrary, it avowedly takes into consideration, as an element {{in the distribution of}} the produce, capital as well as labor. It proposes that the operations of industry should be carried on by associations of about two thousand members, combining their labor on a district of about a square league in extent, under the guidance of chiefs selected by themselves (the “phalanstery”). In the distribution a certain minimum is first assigned for the subsistence of every member of the community, whether capable or not of labor. The remainder of the produce is shared in certain proportions, to be determined beforehand, among the three elements, Labor, Capital, and Talent. The capital of the community may be owned in unequal shares by different members, who would in that case receive, as in any other joint-stock company, proportional dividends. The claim of each person on the share of the produce apportioned to talent is estimated by the grade or rank which the individual occupies in the several groups of laborers to which he or she belongs, these grades being in all cases conferred by the choice of his or her companions. The remuneration, when received, would not of necessity be expended or enjoyed in common; there would be separate ménages for all who preferred them, and no other community of living is contemplated than that {{all the members of the}} association should reside in the same pile of buildings; for saving of labor and expense, not only in building, but in every branch of domestic economy; and in order that, the whole buying and selling operations of the community being performed by a <b>single</b> <b>agent,</b> the enormous portion of the produce of industry now carried off by the profits of mere distributors might be reduced to the smallest amount possible.|$|E

But he was unluckily endowed with a good name and a large though encumbered estate, both of which went rather to injure than to advance him. He had a taste for law, which cost him many thousands yearly; and being a great deal too clever to be robbed, as he said, by any <b>single</b> <b>agent,</b> allowed his affairs to be mismanaged by a dozen, whom he all equally mistrusted. He was such a sharp landlord, that he could hardly find any but bankrupt tenants; and such a close farmer, as to grudge almost the seed to the ground, whereupon revengeful Nature grudged him the crops which she granted to more liberal husbandmen. He speculated in every possible way; he worked mines; bought canal-shares; horsed coaches; took government contracts, and was the busiest man and magistrate of his county. As he would not pay honest agents at his granite quarry, he had the satisfaction of finding that four overseers ran away, and took fortunes with them to America. For want of proper precautions, his coal-mines filled with water: the government flung his contract of damaged beef upon his hands: and for his coach-horses, every mail proprietor in the kingdom knew that he lost more horses than any man in the country, from underfeeding and buying cheap. In disposition he was sociable, and far from being proud; nay, he rather preferred the society of a farmer or a horse-dealer to that of a gentleman, like my lord, his son: he was fond of drink, of swearing, of joking with the farmers' daughters: he was never known to give away a shilling or to do a good action, but was of a pleasant, sly, laughing mood, and would cut his joke and drink his glass with a tenant and sell him up the next day; or have his laugh with the poacher he was transporting with equal good humour. His politeness for the fair sex has already been hinted at by Miss Rebecca Sharp--in a word, the whole baronetage, peerage, commonage of England, did not contain a more cunning, mean, selfish, foolish, disreputable old man. That blood-red hand of Sir Pitt Crawley's would be in anybody's pocket except his own; and it is with grief and pain, that, as admirers of the British aristocracy, we find ourselves obliged to admit the existence of so many ill qualities in a person whose name is in Debrett.|$|E
