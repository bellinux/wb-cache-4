5|$|Ina Coolbrith {{was born}} Josephine Donna <b>Smith</b> <b>in</b> Nauvoo, Illinois, {{the last of}} three daughters of Agnes Moulton Coolbrith and Don Carlos Smith, brother to Joseph Smith Coolbrith's father died of malarial fever four months after her birth, and a sister died one month after that; Coolbrith's mother then married Joseph <b>Smith,</b> <b>in</b> 1842, {{becoming}} his sixth or seventh wife. No children came of the union—Agnes felt neglected in her unfruitful Levirate marriage, the only such marriage of <b>Smith.</b> <b>In</b> June 1844, Smith was killed {{at the hands of}} an anti-Mormon mob.

Twin sons were born to the couple, and in 1851 Pickett traveled overland with his new family to California in a wagon train. On the long trek, the young Ina read from a book of Shakespeare's works and from a collection of Byron's poems. As a ten-year-old girl, Ina entered California in front of the wagon train with the famous African-American scout Jim Beckwourth, riding with him on his horse, through what would later be named Beckwourth Pass. The family settled in Los Angeles, California, and Pickett established a law practice.|$|E

5|$|Lactarius nordmanensis was {{described}} by Alexander <b>Smith</b> <b>in</b> 1960 to account for a North American species closely resembling L.torminosus in appearance, but with a slightly larger range of spore sizes (9–11 by 6.5–8μm). In contrast to the unchanging latex of L.torminosus, L.nordmanensis has whitish latex that slowly changes to pale yellow upon exposure to air; the latex also stains mushroom tissues and paper yellow. Hesler and Smith reduced L.nordmanensis {{to the status of}} a variety under L.torminosus in 1979. Lactarius torminosus var. nordmanensis has been recorded from California, Idaho, Michigan, and Wisconsin in the United States, Quebec in Canada, and Switzerland. The variety resembles Lactarius pubescens var. betulae, but differs in its longer pleurocystidia, larger spores with slightly different spore ornamentation, and strongly burning acrid taste. The holotype specimen of L.torminosus var. nordmanensis was collected by <b>Smith</b> <b>in</b> 1956 near Nordman, Idaho.|$|E
