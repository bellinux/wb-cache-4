5|$|Over 1000serpins {{have now}} been identified, {{including}} 36human proteins, as well as molecules in all kingdoms of life—animals, plants, fungi, bacteria, and archaea—and some viruses. In the 2000s, a systematic nomenclature was introduced in order to categorise members of the serpin <b>superfamily</b> based on their evolutionary relationships.

The monophyly of five <b>superfamilies</b> within the Caelifera was well supported by our analyses (BI_NADH, ML/BI_(COX + Cyt b), and ML/BI_COX) (Figures  1, 2, and 3 A,B). Relationships among the five <b>superfamilies</b> were (Tridactyloidea + (Tetrigoidea + (Eumastacoidea + (Pneumoroidea + (Acridoidea))))). The Tridactyloidea occupied the basal position.|$|R
5|$|Two {{evolutionarily}} independent enzyme superfamilies {{with different}} protein folds {{are known to}} use the N-terminal residue as a nucleophile: <b>Superfamily</b> PB (proteasomes using the Ntn fold) and <b>Superfamily</b> PE (acetyltransferases using the DOM fold) This commonality of active site structure in completely different protein folds indicates that the active site evolved convergently in those superfamilies.|$|E
5|$|Acrocanthosaurus is {{classified}} in the <b>superfamily</b> Allosauroidea within the infraorder Tetanurae. This <b>superfamily</b> is characterized by paired ridges on the nasal and lacrimal bones {{on top of the}} snout and tall neural spines on the neck vertebrae, among other features. It was originally placed in the family Allosauridae with Allosaurus, an arrangement also supported by studies as late as 2000.

40|$|A few protein domain <b>superfamilies</b> {{have been}} shown to account for {{unexpectedly}} large numbers of proteins encoded in fully sequenced genomes. These large <b>superfamilies</b> are generally very diverse, spanning a wide range of functions, both in terms of molecular activities and biological processes. Some of these <b>superfamilies,</b> such as the Rossmann-fold P-loop nucleotide hydrolases or the TIM-barrel glycosidases, {{have been the subject of}} extensive structural studies which in turn have shed light on how evolution of the sequence and structure properties produce functional diversity amongst homologues. Recently, the Structure-Function Linkage Database (SFLD) has been setup with the aim of helping the study of structure-function correlations in such <b>superfamilies.</b> Since the evolutionary success of these large <b>superfamilies</b> suggests biological importance, several Structural Genomics Centers have focused on providing full structural coverage for representatives of all sequence families in these <b>superfamilies.</b> |$|R
40|$|SummaryThis paper {{explores the}} {{structural}} continuum in CATH {{and the extent}} to which <b>superfamilies</b> adopt distinct folds. Although most <b>superfamilies</b> are structurally conserved, in some of the most highly populated <b>superfamilies</b> (4 % of all <b>superfamilies)</b> there is considerable structural divergence. While relatives share a similar fold in the evolutionary conserved core, diverse elaborations to this core can result in significant differences in the global structures. Applying similar protocols to examine the extent to which structural overlaps occur between different fold groups, it appears this effect is confined to just a few architectures and is largely due to small, recurring super-secondary motifs (e. g., αβ-motifs, α-hairpins). Although 24 % of <b>superfamilies</b> overlap with <b>superfamilies</b> having different folds, only 14 % of nonredundant structures in CATH are involved in overlaps. Nevertheless, the existence of these overlaps suggests that, in some regions of structure space, the fold universe should be seen as more continuous...|$|R

40|$|PASS 2 is {{a nearly}} {{automated}} version of CAMPASS and contains sequence alignments of proteins grouped {{at the level}} of <b>superfamilies.</b> This database has been created to fall in correspondence with SCOP database (1. 53 release) and currently consists of 110 multi-member <b>superfamilies</b> and 613 <b>superfamilies</b> corresponding to single members. In multi-member <b>superfamilies,</b> protein chains with no more than 25 % sequence identity have been considered for the alignment and hence the database aims to address sequence alignments which represent 26   219 protein domains under the SCOP 1. 53 release. Structure-based sequence alignments have been obtained by COMPARER and the initial equivalences are provided automatically from a MALIGN alignment and subsequently augmented using STAMP 4. 0.
