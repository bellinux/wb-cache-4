40|$|AIMS: To {{evaluate}} the predictive {{value of the}} nuclear DNA content (image cytometry) and p 53 overexpression (immuno-histochemistry using antibody CM- 1) in uniformly treated <b>stage</b> <b>I</b> carcinomas of the mobile tongue. Also, to compare <b>stage</b> <b>I</b> carcinomas with advanced tongue carcinomas (stages II-IV). METHODS: Archival formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded tumour specimens from 54 patients with <b>stage</b> <b>I</b> squamous cell carcinoma and 37 patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma were analysed. Mean follow up time of the <b>stage</b> <b>I</b> carcinomas was 71 months (median, 62. 5; range, 6 - 175). RESULTS: Twenty three patients (<b>stage</b> <b>I)</b> had recurring disease: 10 had local recurrence (in the tongue) and 13 had regional recurrence (cervical metastases). Locally recurring <b>stage</b> <b>I</b> carcinomas had a more pronounced DNA deviation than the other <b>stage</b> <b>I</b> carcinomas and this degree of deviation was comparable with the DNA content of advanced carcinomas. <b>Stage</b> <b>I</b> carcinomas that developed regional recurrences overexpressed p 53 more frequently. In Cox multivariate regression analysis of time to recurrence, DNA deviation was a significant parameter in tumours that recurred locally (p = 0. 032). p 53 overexpression was the only parameter close to significance for regional recurrence (p = 0. 065). CONCLUSIONS: Nuclear DNA content and p 53 immunostaining are of value for the prediction of recurrence of <b>stage</b> <b>I</b> squamous cell carcinomas of the mobile tongue. <b>Stage</b> <b>I</b> tongue carcinomas that are prone to local recurrence show the same DNA content as do advanced tongue carcinomas...|$|R

40|$|Background: We {{investigated}} factors predicting postoperative recurrence {{in patients}} with pathological <b>Stage</b> <b>I</b> nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: All patients with clinical <b>Stage</b> <b>I</b> NSCLC who underwent surgical resection at Tri-Service General Hospital in Taiwan between January 2002 and June 2006 were reviewed retrospectively. All study patients underwent standard staging workups. We reviewed the records of 261 patients with an average follow-up of 93 months; we then included 179 patients with pathological <b>Stage</b> <b>I.</b> Results: Two hundred sixty-one patients with clinical <b>Stage</b> <b>I</b> NSCLC were eligible. There {{were no significant differences}} in sex, tumor histopathology, location, and age between the two groups (recurrence and nonrecurrence), except for tumor differentiation (p =  0. 002), survival rate (p <  0. 001), lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI; p =  0. 007), advanced pathology stage (p =  0. 022), maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax; p =  0. 027), tumor size (p <  0. 011), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels (p =  0. 013). Overall survival was significantly related to postoperative recurrence (p <  0. 001) {{in patients with}} pathological <b>Stage</b> <b>I,</b> in whom recurrences developed in 11. 17 %. Only 179 patients with pathological <b>Stage</b> <b>I</b> NSCLC, including 20 patients with postoperative recurrences, were selected.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fourteen children with testicular yolk sac tumor (including 10 cas-es of <b>stage</b> <b>I</b> and 4 cases of stage II) underwent high ligation of internal spermatic cord vein and orchiectomy. Among these, seven cases of <b>stage</b> <b>I</b> were below 1 year of age. Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection without postoperative systemic chemotherapy was implemented in 9 cases (5 cases of <b>stage</b> <b>I</b> and 4 cases of stage II), {{and only one}} was positive.

40|$|<b>Stage</b> <b>I</b> and II {{testicular}} {{germ cell}} tumors (GCTs) {{are almost always}} cured with appropriate treatment and most ongoing research regarding these tumors focuses on minimizing treatment toxicity. The management of clinical <b>stage</b> <b>I</b> testicular GCTs has grown more complicated due {{to the emergence of}} a brief course of chemotherapy as an additional treatment option for <b>stage</b> <b>I</b> seminomas and <b>stage</b> <b>I</b> nonseminomas.

At this point in history, <b>stage</b> <b>I</b> patients have three treatment options following radical orchiectomy: adjuvant (sometimes called “primary”) chemotherapy (carboplatin for seminomas and the combined regimen of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin for nonseminomas), surveillance, and either retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (for nonseminomas) or radiotherapy (for pure seminomas).

40|$|Purpose: Renal cell {{carcinoma}} is increasingly diagnosed at <b>stage</b> <b>I,</b> and among <b>stage</b> <b>I</b> cases mean tumor size has been decreasing. Previous reports suggest that nephron sparing surgery is underused for small renal {{cell carcinoma}}s. We determined updated, population based treatment trends for <b>stage</b> <b>I</b> {{renal cell carcinoma}}. Materials and Methods: The National Cancer Data Base, which captures approximately 70 % of all cancer diagnoses in the United States, was queried for renal cell carcinoma in adults diagnosed between 1993 and 2007. Trends in treatment, including no surgery, total nephrectomy, partial nephrectomy and focal ablation, were analyzed among all <b>stage</b> <b>I</b> tumors and small <b>stage</b> <b>I</b> tumors categorized by size. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of nephron sparing surgery (partial nephrectomy or focal ablation). Results: During the study period we identified 242, 740 renal cell carcinomas, of which 127, 691 were <b>stage</b> <b>I.</b> For all <b>stage</b> <b>I</b> tumors partial nephrectomy increased from 6. 3 % to 32. 2 % of cases and ablation increased from 1. 0 % to 6. 8 %. For tumors less than 2. 0, 2. 0 to 2. 9 and 3. 0 to 3. 9 cm partial nephrectomy increased from 15. 3 % to 61. 1 %, 11. 0 % to 44. 2 % and 7. 2 % to 31. 1 %, respectively (each p < 0. 001). Female gender, black race, Hispanic ethnicity, lower income, older age and treatment at community hospitals were associated with lower use of nephron sparing. Conclusions: While total nephrectomy is still likely overused for small renal cell carcinoma, nephron sparing surgery for <b>stage</b> <b>I</b> renal cell carcinoma has increased substantially in the last 15 years with about 4 -fold increases across tumor sizes.
