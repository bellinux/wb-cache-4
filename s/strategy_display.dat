40|$|Using {{an optimal}} changepoint approach, {{we find a}} {{structural}} change in the relation between hedge funds’ stock market exposure and aggregate stock market liquidity {{that takes place in}} the period 2000 to 2002. Before the structural break, market betas have no relation to liquidity and only a few style categories of hedge funds show increased market presence when liquidity is low. After the break, the relationship is inverted, pointing towards an increased liquidity timing ability of hedge funds, as users of liquidity. We relate our findings to best execution rules and decimalization in the US stock market that were introduced in that period and impacted aggregate liquidity conditions. Furthermore, the returns to a momentum <b>strategy</b> <b>display</b> a similar structural break and momentum-loading funds constitute a sizeable proportion of hedge funds that manifest a distinct beta-liquidity evolution with a structural break in that period...|$|E

Now, the electronics industries are starting to find out whether the <b>display</b> <b>strategy</b> is also applicable in the electronics industry or not. There is big confusion about the definition of <b>display</b> <b>strategy,</b> the importance of having <b>display</b> <b>strategy</b> in their promotion strategy. Even now, the implementations of <b>display</b> <b>strategy</b> in multinational electronics industry still blur. The Authors use descriptive research as the research method, supported with the primary and secondary data from the observation, interview, and questionnaire.

Besides that, see and try the product first are very important in buying decision of customers. The <b>display</b> <b>strategy,</b> especially the effective <b>display</b> <b>strategy</b> can increase the exposure of the products, thus increase the attractiveness and willingness of the customers to see and to buy the products.

30|$|The {{distinction}} in submergence response <b>strategy</b> <b>displayed</b> by the landrace FR 13 A and deepwater rice illustrates {{a delicate balance}} between utilization versus conservation of reserves when overall energy production is compromised. In {{the case of a}} slow rising flood, investment of energy into elongation growth is a successful survival strategy. However, when the flood is deep and prolonged, the protection of energy reserves and growth meristems provides an advantage. Remarkably, the phytohormone ethylene and multigenic loci encoding ERFs control the distinct response strategies of submergence tolerant and deepwater rice. In both cases, the transcription of specific ERFs is promoted by submergence through the increase in cellular ethylene content in underwater organs (Fukao et al. 2006; Hattori et al. 2009; Fig.  3; Fig.  7).|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Life History Theory (LHT) {{predicts that}} natural {{selection}} favours {{a degree of}} developmental plasticity {{when it comes to}} sexual <b>strategies</b> and mating <b>displays.</b> Individuals should develop a faster life history strategy (showing, for example, higher mating effort and a preference for a variety of mates) when they are raised in a relatively unstable environment with high extrinsic mortality. In contrast, individuals should develop a slower life history strategy (showing, for example, lower mating effort and a preference for investment in longterm parenting) when they are raised in a relatively stable environment with low extrinsic mortality. Most previous research examining predictions derived from LHT regarding sexual <b>strategies</b> and mating <b>displays</b> has used survey designs and self-report instruments exclusively. The current study represents a departure from such designs in that I used a quasiexperimental design to examine sexual <b>strategies</b> and mating <b>displays</b> in virtual chatrooms, and to test LHT-based predictions about those <b>strategies</b> and <b>displays.</b> Specifically, I tested the hypotheses that, in the chatrooms, individuals would adopt sexual <b>strategies</b> and mating <b>displays</b> reflective of their different life history strategies, and that these behaviours would manifest in the virtual world much like they have been documented to manifest in the real world. I used the Mini-K Short Form questionnaire, a 20 -item instrument designed to measure both cognitive and behavioural aspects of life history strategy, to designate undergraduate males (n = 44) and females (n = 47) as having either a fast or a slow life history. Ten separate groups of these participants, each featuring 3 - 5 men and 4 - 5 women, then interacted in separate 1 -hour online chat sessions. Results showed that LHS accurately predicted the ways in which male and female participants engaged with one another. Furthermore, men that remained consistent in their LHS presentation (i. e., they behaved in ways consistent with what their LHS predicted they should) were more popular among women than men who were not consistent in this presentation. These results demonstrate the power of evolutionary-based theories of sexual interaction to predict sexual <b>strategies</b> and mating <b>displays</b> in online settings. Further, the 'pure' environment of the online platform, without extraneous real-world constraints, provided an opportunity to document and examine sexual <b>strategies</b> and mating <b>displays</b> in new and exciting ways...|$|R

However, the use and effectiveness of context caches has not been evaluated or demonstrated. The Context Provisioning Architecture employs a caching mechanism at the context broker, which positively affects the mean query satisfaction time between context consumers and providers. We have analysed the relative performance of various cache replacement policies using the OMNET++ discrete event simulator. Our analysis has revealed that different caching <b>strategies</b> <b>display</b> contrasting behaviour under different scope distribution scenarios, with OF policy performing better for short scoped context data and SE performing better for long scoped context data. Based on this observation, we have devised a novel bipartite caching strategy for use in context data provisioning that allows utilization of the OF and SE policies for SV and LV scoped context data during context provisioning.|$|R

40|$|Bacteria have {{developed}} an impressive ability to survive and propagate in highly diverse and changing environments by evolving phenotypic heterogeneity. Phenotypic heterogeneity ensures that a subpopulation is well prepared for environmental changes. The expression bet hedging is commonly (but often incorrectly) used by molecular biologists to describe any observed phenotypic heterogeneity. In evolutionary biology, however, bet hedging denotes a risk-spreading <b>strategy</b> <b>displayed</b> by isogenic populations that evolved in unpredictably changing environments. Opposed to other survival strategies, bet hedging evolves because the selection environment changes and favours different phenotypes at different times. Consequently, in bet hedging populations all phenotypes perform differently well at any time, depending on the selection pressures present. Moreover, bet hedging is the only strategy in which temporal variance of offspring numbers per individual is minimized. Our paper aims to provide a guide for the correct {{use of the term}} bet hedging in molecular biology. ...|$|R
