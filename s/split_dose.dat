40|$|Objective. High {{volumes of}} {{polyethylene}} glycol (PEG) -based solutions as bowel preparation for colonoscopy are effective, but often poorly tolerated. To compare a 2 l PEG-based solution combined with ascorbic acid (PEG + Asc) with 4 l PEG-based solution (PEG). Methods. In a single blind, quasi-randomized, prospective study, 350 patients undergoing colonoscopy received 2 l of PEG + Asc or 4 l of PEG. For morning procedures, the total dose of PEG + Asc was taken the evening before, for afternoon colonoscopies, PEG + Asc was given as a <b>split</b> <b>dose.</b> The 4 l PEG preparation was given as a <b>split</b> <b>dose.</b> Efficacy of preparation was {{scored on a}} five-point scale in three different colon segments. Patients' experiences were evaluated using a questionnaire. Results. From 307 patients (149 PEG + Asc, 158 PEG), results were available. Successful colon cleansing was achieved in 90. 6 % in the PEG + Asc group compared to 96 % in the PEG group (not significant). In patients prepared with PEG + Asc, bowel cleansing was worse when patients underwent colonoscopy in the morning, compared to afternoon procedures. Side-effects and patients' experiences were similar in the PEG + Asc and PEG group. Conclusions. Low-volume PEG + ascorbic acid has comparable efficacy and tolerability as high-volume PEG solution. The cleansing results were worse if patients received the full dose PEG + Asc the evening before the procedure compared to the <b>split</b> <b>dose.</b> Our data support the administration of PEG + Asc as a <b>split</b> <b>dose</b> before the procedure...|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{elucidate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} a <b>split</b> <b>dose</b> of midazolam in combination with meperidine for colonoscopy. METHODS: Eighty subjects undergoing outpatient colonoscopy {{were randomly assigned to}} group A or B. Group A (n = 40) received a <b>split</b> <b>dose</b> of midazolam in combination with meperidine. Group B (n = 40) received a single dose of midazolam in combination with meperidine. Outcome measurements were level of sedation, duration of sedation and recovery, degree of pain and satisfaction, procedure-related memory, controllability, and adverse events. RESULTS: Group A had a lower frequency of significant hypoxemia (P = 0. 043) and a higher sedation score on withdrawal of the endoscope from the descending colon than group B (P = 0. 043). Group B recovered from sedation slightly sooner than group A (P < 0. 002). Scores for pain and memory, except insertion-related memory, were lower in group A one week after colonoscopic examination (P = 0. 018 and P < 0. 030, respectively).

Liberalized precolonoscopy diet, <b>split</b> <b>dose</b> purgative, {{and the use}} of MiraLAX-based bowel preparation (MBBP) prior to colonoscopy are recently developed measures to improve bowel preparation quality but {{little is known about the}} utilization prevalence of these measures. We examined the patterns of utilization of these newer approaches to improve precolonoscopy bowel preparation quality among American gastroenterologists. Methods: Surveys were distributed to a random sample of members of the American College of Gastroenterologists. Participants were queried regarding demographics, practice characteristics, and bowel preparation recommendations including recommendations for liberal dietary restrictions, <b>split</b> <b>dose</b> purgative, {{and the use of}} MBBP. Approaches were evaluated individually and in combination. Results: Of the 999 eligible participants, 288 responded; 15. 2 % recommended a liberal diet, 60. 0 % <b>split</b> <b>dose</b> purgative, and 37. 4 % MBBP. Diet recommendations varied geographically with gastroenterologists in the West more likely to recommend a restrictive diet (odds ratio [OR] 2. 98, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 16 â€“ 7. 67) and physicians in the Northeast more likely to recommend a liberal diet more likely. Older physicians more often recommended split dosing (OR 1. 04, 95 % CI 1. 04 â€“ 2. 97). Use of MBBP was more common in suburban settings (OR 2. 14, 95 % CI 1. 23 â€“ 3. 73). Evidence suggests that physicians in private practice were more likely to prescribe split dosing (p = 0. 03) and less often recommended MBBP (p = 0. 02). Likelihood of prescribing MBBP increased as weekly volume of colonoscopy increased (p = 0. 03). Conclusions: To enhance bowel preparation quality American gastroenterologists commonly use purgative split dosing. The use of MBBP is becoming more prevalent while a liberalized diet is infrequently recommended. Utilization of these newer approaches to improve bowel preparation quality varies by physician and practice characteristics.

Objectives: To study the bioavailability of a divided higher oral methotrexate (MTX) dose, in comparison to a single dose, in adult {{patients with}} rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods: A pharmacokinetic analysis was performed in 10 RA patients, on a stable dose (25 - 35 mg weekly) MTX. Separated by one week, a pharmacokinetic analysis was performed in each patient after oral single dose, and after an equal but <b>split</b> <b>dose</b> divided by 8 hours. MTX serum concentrations were measured by a fluorescence polarization immunoassay technique. Analysis was performed by calculation of the area under the curve (AUC) by the trapezoidal rule and {{by means of an}} iterative two-stage Bayesian population procedure, obtaining population and individual pharmacokinetic parameters. For the population analysis data from the 15 patients in our previous study [1], comparing oral and subcutaneous administration of MTX, were also used. Results: The median MTX dose was 30 mg weekly (range 25 - 35 mg). The bioavailability of the <b>split</b> <b>dose</b> was 28 % higher compared to a single dose (p= 0. 007). In the population pharmacokinetic modeling a two-compartment model best described the serum MTX concentration versus time curves. The mean bioavailability after a single dose and a <b>split</b> <b>dose</b> MTX was 0. 76 and 0. 90 respectively, compared to subcutaneous administration.

The results showed that nitrogen management at LCC value of 4 (150 kg N ha- 1) produced significantly higher tillers (369. 3 m- 2) at maximum tillering stage, plant height (81. 7 cm) at maturity, dry matter at flowering (5. 71 t ha- 1) and grain yield (2915 kg ha- 1) than LCC value of 3 that produced grain yield of 2211 kg ha- 1. Soil test crop response based nitrogen application produced markedly lower grain yield (2475 kg ha- 1) than the LCC value 4 of nitrogen management. Among the different <b>split</b> <b>doses</b> of nitrogen, application of 150 kg N ha- 1 in four splits â€“ 1 / 6 at 15 DAS, 1 / 3 at tillering, 1 / 3 at PI, 1 / 6 at flowering recorded higher tillers (361 m- 2), plant height (77. 0 cm), dry matter at flowering (5. 20 t ha- 1) and grain yield (2827 kg ha- 1) over four equal splits where the grain yield was 2673 kg ha- 1.

40|$|The {{phytoextraction}} {{of heavy}} metals using chelating agents {{has been widely}} studied for the remediation of contaminated soils. To evaluate the efficiency of EDTA-induced phytoextraction of Ba and Pb using Brachiaria decumbens for the remediation of soil contaminated by oil well drilling and exploration waste, an experiment was conducted by applying a single dose (6 mmol EDTA kg- 1 soil) and <b>split</b> <b>doses</b> of EDTA (three applications of 2 mmol EDTA kg- 1 soil). The samples were subjected to sequential extractions using the method proposed by Ure et al. (1993) as modified by Rauret et al. (1999). The application of EDTA did not influence the distribution of Ba in various chemical fractions of the soil. The dry matter production {{did not differ significantly}} between the treatments and the control, thereby demonstrating the tolerance of plants to the experimental conditions. The absorption of Pb by plants was influenced by the application of EDTA. The application of a single dose of EDTA influenced the absorption of Pb and its translocation to the aerial plant parts. The application of <b>split</b> <b>doses</b> favoured higher accumulation of Pb in roots. Because of its tolerance to heavy metals and EDTA, B. decumbens {{has the potential to be}} used in phytostabilisation...|$|R

Two sources (urea and ammonium nitrate) of nitrogen each with two doses (300 and 600 gm) were applied in <b>split</b> <b>doses</b> before flowering and after fruit setting. It was observed that 600 g N per tree from urea proved best for quality improvement followed by ammonium nitrate. The combined application of urea and Ammonium nitrate (300 + 300 g) was found better than their individual effects with the same dozes...|$|R
40|$|Background: Technosphere (R) insulin (TI), an inhaled {{human insulin}} with a fast onset of action, {{provides}} a novel {{option for the}} control of prandial glucose. We used the University of Virginia (UVA) /Padova simulator to explore in-silico the potential benefit of different dosing regimens on postprandial glucose (PPG) control to support the design of further clinical trials. Tested dosing regimens included at-meal or postmeal dosing, or dosing before and after a meal (<b>split</b> <b>dosing).</b> Methods: Various dosing regimens of TI were compared among {{one another and to}} insulin lispro in 100 virtual type- 1 patients. Individual doses were identified for each regimen following different titration rules. The resulting postprandial glucose profiles were analyzed to quantify efficacy and the risk for hypoglycemic events. Results: This approach allowed us to assess the benefit/risk for each TI dosing regimen and to compare results with simulations of insulin lispro. We identified a new titration rule for TI that could significantly improve the efficacy of treatment with TI. Conclusion: In-silico clinical trials comparing the treatment effect of different dosing regimens with TI and of insulin lispro suggest that postmeal <b>dosing</b> or <b>split</b> <b>dosing</b> of TI, in combination with an appropriate titration rule, can achieve a superior postprandial glucose control while providing a lower risk for hypoglycemic events than conventional treatment with subcutaneously administered rapid-acting insulin products...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Results of meta-analyses of {{randomized}} trials comparing PEG and NaP are inconsistent {{and have not}} included trials comparing either or both preps to less traditional ones. AIM: To perform a meta-analysis by treatment arm. Methods Using MEDLINE and EMBASE, we identified English-language trials published from 1990 to 2008 that included PEG and/or NaP, and aggregated them by treatment arm into: 4 liter (L) PEG; 2 L PEG; split-dose PEG; two 45 ml doses of NaP +/- adjunctive medication; and NaP tablets. We compared prep quality and the proportion completing the prep. Results Among 71 trials (patient N = 10, 201), excellent prep quality was present in 34 % (CI, 26 - 41 %) for 4 L PEG alone; 39 % (CI, 26 - 51 %) for 2 L PEG; 37 % (CI, 28 - 46 %) for split-dose PEG; 42 % (CI, 33 - 51 %) for NaP solution; 44 % (CI, 38 - 51 %) for NaP with adjunctive meds; and 58 % (CI, 49 - 67 %) for NaP tablets. Patients receiving NaP {{were more likely to}} complete the prep (97 % [CI, 96 - 98 %] vs. 90 % [CI, 87 - 92 %] for 4 L PEG alone); however, completion rates for 2 L PEG (98 %) and <b>split</b> <b>dose</b> PEG (95 %) were similar to NaP. Conclusions NaP tablets resulted in better prep quality and higher completion rates compared to other regimens. In comparisons limited by sample size, <b>split</b> <b>dose</b> PEG was not statistically different from NaP solution for completion rate or prep quality. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objective. To {{study the}} {{bioavailability}} of a divided higher oral dose of methotrexate (MTX), {{in comparison to}} a single dose, in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods. A pharmacokinetic analysis was performed in 10 patients with RA taking a stable dose (25 - 35 mg weekly) of MTX. Separated by one week, a pharmacokinetic analysis was performed in each patient after an oral single dose, and after an equal but <b>split</b> <b>dose</b> separated by 8 hours. MTX serum concentrations were measured by a fluorescence polarization immunoassay technique. Analysis was performed by calculation of the area under the curve (AUC) by the trapezoidal rule and {{by means of an}} iterative 2 -stage Bayesian population procedure, obtaining population and individual pharmacokinetic parameters. For the population analysis, data from 15 patients in our previous study comparing oral and subcutaneous administration of MTX were also used. Results. The median MTX dose was 30 mg weekly (range 25 - 35 mg). The bioavailability of the <b>split</b> <b>dose</b> was 28 % higher compared to the single dose (p = 0. 007). In the population pharmacokinetic modeling, a 2 -compartment model best described the serum MTX concentration versus time curves. The mean bioavailability after single-dose and split-dose MTX was 0. 76 and 0. 90, respectively, compared to subcutaneous administration. There was a statistically significant difference in the bioavailability of the 2 oral administration regimens (p = 0. 008). Conclusion. The bioavailability of oral higher dose MTX in adult patients with RA can be improved by splitting the dose...|$|E
40|$|Two {{methods of}} N application, four levels of P and {{two levels of}} K were tested to {{evaluate}} the effect of NPK on the yielding components of canola (cv. Dunkeld). Sole dose of N proved superior to <b>split</b> <b>dose</b> and produced significantly more branches per plant. Nitrogen had no influence on pods per plant, seeds per pod and grain weight. Increase in P, linearly increased the pods per plant and seeds per pod, while P had no influence on grain weight and branches per plant. Potassium showed no significant effect on branches formation, pods per plant, seeds per pod and grain weight. Phosphorus {{seems to be the}} major influencing element among NPK in regulating the yielding components of canola...|$|E

Bhavani distilleries and chemicals Ltd., T. Pudur, Thimiri, Vellore District. Sugarcane crop was raised with ten treatments comprising the one-time as pre-plant application (30 days before planting) of BDS at 100, 112. 5, 150 and 187. 5 m 3 ha - 1, pre and post-plant application of BDS at 112. 5, 150 and 187. 5 m 3 ha - 1 as <b>split</b> <b>doses</b> at various stages of crop growth and application of biocompost at 2. 5 and 5 t ha - 1 along with control. The soil samples were collected at 90 days intervals and analyzed for the change in soil microbial population and enzyme activities. The {{results of the study}} showed that the microbial population and enzymatic activities of the soil were substantially increased throughout the crop growth period due to biomethanated distillery spentwash and bio-compost application. The highest microbial population and enzyme activities were recorded with split application of BDS at 187. 5 m 3 ha - 1 along with balance P fertilizer. This study revealed that the utilization of biomethanated distillery spentwash at 187. 5 m 3 ha - 1 as <b>split</b> <b>doses</b> along with balance phosphorus requirement through inorganic fertilizer could improve the microbial population and enzyme activities in sugarcane grown soil...|$|R
