40|$|Control and triathlete volunteers (n = 8 and n = 15, respectively) {{were given}} 400 mL and 200 mL of aronia-citrus juice (AC-juice), respectively. The 24 h urine samples were {{hydrolysed}} {{to determine the}} flavanones concentration by UPLC-QqQ-MS/MS. The flavanones metabolites in both groups of volunteers were glucuronides, sulfates, and sulfo-glucuronides, and the total excretion of flavanones increased fivefold in the triathletes compared with the control volunteers. The increase of ninefold in the homoeriodictyol of triathletes compared to control volunteers may suggest the overactivation of the microbiota metabolism caused by physical exercise. No differences concerning the bioavailability were detected {{between men and women}} in controlboth groups. The AC-juice could provide synergistic effects on health due to the increase in the bioavailability of flavanones, avoiding the deleterious effects caused by the overdosage of nutritional supplements.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{established}} {{the pattern of}} isoprostanes (IsoPs) and prostaglandins metabolites (PGMs) in urine after triathlon training. Fifteen Caucasian triathletes – 5 women and 10 men – performed 793 and 1603 Objective Load Scales, respectively. The optimization of urine hydrolysis conditions, concerning {{to the type of}} buffer, the units of hydrolytic enzyme added, and the pH, allowed precise quantification of these metabolites by UPLC–MS/MS, avoiding the under-estimation of their concentrations that occurred in previous studies. Their rate of conjugation ranged between 36 % and 100 %. This implies significant importance since it supposes non-detection of some IsoPs and PGMs totally conjugated with glucuronic acid developed by other previous methodologies. Among the 13 compounds analyzed, this assay detected and characterized 4 IsoPs and 3 PGMs in the triathletes’ urine. The PGMs tetranor-PGEM and 11 β-PGF 2 α and the IsoP 8 -iso-PGF 2 α, showed lower concentrations after the training program, whereas the PGMs 6 -keto-PGF 1 α increased (vascular PGI 2 metabolite). In fact, their pattern in the triathletes’ urine indicated that their variation may have been related with the physical activity. Due to its high variation, 6 -keto PGF 1 α stood out as a useful marker of the vasodilation and inhibition of the platelet aggregation of the PGI 2 linked to the physical exercise. The data obtained provided a global picture of changes in lipid peroxidation and vascular events as a consequence of chronic exercise.

40|$|Abstract—Mostly {{of public}} {{financing}} programs at {{national and regional}} level are funded from European Union sources. EU can participate directly to a national and regional program (example LEADER initiative, URBAN…) or indirectly by funding regional or national funds. Funds from European Union are provided from EU multiannual financial framework form which the annual budget is programmed. The adjusted program 2007 - 2013 of the EU considered commitments of almost 1 trillion Euros for the EU- 28 countries. Provisions of the new program 2014 - 2020 consider commitments of more than 1 trillion Euros. Sustainable growth, divided to Cohesion and Competitiveness for Growth an Employment, {{is one of the}} two principal categories; the other is the preservation and management of natural resources. Through this financing process SMEs benefited of EU and public sources by receiving grants for their investments. Most of the financial instruments are available indirectly through the national financial intermediaries. Part of them is managed by the European Investment Fund. The paper focuses on the public financing to SMEs by examining case studies on divers forms of public help. It tries to distinguish the efficiency of the examined good practices and therefore try to have some conclusions on the possibility of application to other regions.

Problem: How do banks use financial reports and accounts during SMEs’ loan granting? Purpose: The main {{goal of the}} thesis is to analyse how banks use financial reports and accounts during SMEs’ loan granting. Additionally, we will analyse what kind of information in the financial statements lenders prioritise when deciding {{to grant a loan}} to SMEs. Methodology: We used a qualitative and deductive scientific method. The empirical material and data has been collected through four face-to-face interviews with three major banks operating in Umeå. Conclusions: We found that financial and accounting information is significant during credit assessment for SMEs, {{especially when it comes to}} evaluate their repayment ability and control of their financial stability. Still, there are other factors that play a major roll and have therefore to be taken into consideration such as acquaintance and what the loan is going to be used for.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the validity of}} governmental supports and policies; and financing for entrepreneurs {{in the context of}} global entrepreneurial activities. Our studies are based on the rich datasets of the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) database covering 108 countries from 2001 to 2014. In this study, we examine whether countries with more favorable policies and supports towards entrepreneurship and availability of financing for entrepreneurs would result in the higher country’s entrepreneurial activities. We use total early-stage entrepreneurial activity (TEA), a percentage of 18 - 64 year old population who are either a nascent entrepreneur or an owner manager of a new business, as our dependent variable to represent country’s entrepreneurial activities. There are two main explanatory variables used in the study: governmental supports and financing for entrepreneurs. The governmental supports represents the extent to which public policies support entrepreneurship as a relevant economic issue, while financing for entrepreneurs indicates the availability of financial resources for small and medium enterprises (<b>SMEs)</b> including <b>grants</b> and subsidies. We also include three control variables of basic school entrepreneurial education and training; physical and services infrastructure; and cultural and social norms to test the significance of these factors to the country’s entrepreneurial activities. This study adopts panel regression model augmented with control variables. We favor Random Effect model as opposed to Fixed Effect or Pooled OLS model as Hausman and Breusch–Pagan test suggest. Our results suggest that there is no evident that government supports have significant contribution to country’s entrepreneurial activities.   In other words, entrepreneurial activities are more flourished in a country that has not set entrepreneurship as relevant economic issues as it might be the case for many emerging countries. The availability of formal financial resources is significant to the country’s entrepreneurships, but with a negative sign. It could be interpreted that in some countries many new start-ups and entrepreneurs seem to have a greater reliance to informal financing of 4 Fs (Founders, Family, Friends and Foolhardy investors) instead of formal channels i. e. government grant and subsidies, venture capital or strategic partners. A country with cultural and social norms that encourage citizens to new business activities also has greater number of entrepreneurships. However, we found no evident that entrepreneurial education and training at basic school; and ease access to infrastructure are significantly affecting entrepreneurial activities in a country...|$|R
40|$|The {{knowledge}} gained with different research projects, focused on seismic performance of precast reinforced-concrete buildings and during different earthquakes, permits {{to observe that}} the frame resisting systems, if designed for seismic actions, maintain their efficiency. On the contrary, the façade cladding and the connections between structure and panels, can meet with failure. These observations draw the attention to the need of further research on this field. The SAFECLADDING Project was started to tackle this issue with the aim to Improve Fastening Systems of Cladding Panels for Precast Buildings in Seismic Zones. It is a Research Project for <b>SMEs</b> associations, <b>granted</b> by EU FP 7 which involves seven industrial partners: enterprises, European or national associations of precast concrete producers; four universities and the European Laboratory for Structural Assessment (ELSA). The SAFECLADDING Project analyses the {{ways to improve the}} performance of existing buildings, as well as the new ones. Three different Approaches can be followed to enhance the connections in frame-cladding system: Isostatic, Integrated, and Dissipative. The experiment, the mock-up and the test sequence were designed to assess the most common cladding systems using the same frame structure. The mock-up is a single-storey building made by six square columns, inserted into pocket foundations. The columns bear four roof beams and seven slabs, with masses comparable to the common construction with this typology. Two main Façade Arrangements, with horizontal and vertical panels, were selected as the most common in the European industrial buildings. Also different connection layouts subdivide each façade arrangements into different Setups for vertical and horizontal panels. The displacement are applied to the building roof using two pairs of hydraulic actuators for a total load capacity up to 2000  kN, each one equipped by a cell to measure the load. The drift at roof level is continuously measured by two digital displacement transducers. All the other measures of displacements, rotations and deformations are acquired by a network of analog transducers, integrated by optical measurements to capture the displacements of the panels and rigid displacements of the devices included to dissipate energy. The joints involved in the experiments can be classified by the role-played as: Panel-to-Frame, Panel-to-Panel and Simple Retain. The experimental programme, foresees nine different setups for vertical-panel arrangement with twenty-five tests and seven different setups for horizontal-panel arrangement with other nineteen tests. Hence every setup is tested using increasing levels of action, which are quasi static Push-Over (PO) up to 0. 9 % of drift ratio, and Pseudo Dynamic (PsD) both at Serviceability Limit State (SLS) and at Ultimate Limit State (ULS).

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three essays examining different aspects relevant to the banking sectors of developing economies. The first two essays focus on Emerging Europe a region {{with one of the}} highest foreign bank presence in the world - to study the impact of foreign bank ownership and bank organizational structure on the cost of financial intermediation and terms of loan contracts. The last essay focuses on Kenya which is home to M-Pesa the mobile-phone based money trans-fer and financing service initially launched in Kenya in 2007 and subsequently in other emerging countries such as Albania, Romania, India, Egypt and several other African countries - to examine its impact on the performance and outreach of commercial banks. The first essay investigates the impact of foreign bank entry, home and host country conditions on net interest margins (NIMs), using a newly collected panel dataset with ownership information for 265 banks operating in nine Southeast European countries over the period 1995 2011. As the banking sector of many emerging markets and in particular the European transition economies have been dominated by foreign banks understanding the impact of such reforms on host country banking sectors is important for designing supportive policies. We do not find evidence of foreign bank entry having a beneficial effect for host countries in terms of reducing the cost of financial intermediation in the long run, as foreign banks change their behaviour over time. We show that foreign banks have initially lower NIMs compared to domestic banks, however this effect weakens the larger the foreign presence and the more established foreign banks become. We find that home country regulation and supervision have an effect on bank behaviour, with foreign banks coming from countries with stricter regulation having higher NIMs in host countries. The second essay studies the impact of institutions on bank organizational hierarchy. Studying the internal organizational structure of banks is important as it determines the type of information acquired and used in lending decisions and consequently the type of borrowers banks lend to. This is important not only for bank's loan portfolio composition and their financial soundness but also for borrower's ability to access funds on favourable terms and the overall financial system stability and economic development. Using a unique bank-level survey dataset covering 32 countries and 611 banks, we introduce a new and direct measure of organizational hierarchy and exploit the distinctive feature of multi-national banks which face different institutional environments in the countries they operate. We find that the same parent bank is more likely to grant decision-making authority to its foreign affiliates operating in countries with stronger institutions compared to those operating in weaker institutional environments. Combining the bank- with firm-level data we further find that a strong institutional environment which favours a decentralized organizational structure leads to better lending terms to <b>SMEs</b> decentralized banks <b>grant</b> loans with longer maturities, lower interest rates and are less likely to require collateral compared to their centralized counterparts. These findings further our understanding of bank organizational structure as a channel through which law affects lending. In the last essay we use the advent of the mobile money innovation in Kenya in 2007 as an interesting laboratory to investigate the impact of a financial innovation on the performance and outreach of commercial banks. Providing more insights about this link is important as it helps inform the debate among policy-makers and regulators on the impact of a non-traditional source of competition on the service provision of formal financial institutions. Given that financial inclusion is a major problem in developing countries, detailed micro-level evidence on this issue is important for promoting household welfare. Combining the 2006, 2009 and 2013 FinAccess household surveys with bank financial statement and branch penetration data at the county level we find that banks more exposed to the competitive pressure induced by the mobile money innovation improved their performance and expanded their outreach towards households traditionally excluded by formal financial institutions. Additional results further show that households report less supply side barriers to financial access in counties more exposed to the advent of the mobile money innovation. These results highlight the importance of increasing the contestability of banking markets in order to promote financial inclusion and a more competitive banking sector...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{discusses}} {{the protection of}} taxpayers and depositors in the resolution of banks in the Banking Union. The research question concerns how the protection of taxpayers and depositors has been organized in the Banking Union. The thesis focuses on the Single Resolution Mechanism and Deposit Guarantee Schemes and will not discuss the {{other elements of the}} Banking Union. The protection of taxpayers is discussed vis-à-vis the allocation of the costs of banks under resolution and the protection of depositors in terms of bail-in and Deposit Guarantee Schemes. The thesis answers the research question by employing the doctrinal and practical research methods and thus aims to systematize, interpret and assess the provisions critically. The thesis first {{discusses the}} relevant legal theory on the topic. After that, the thesis provides an outline of the Banking Union and analyses first the allocation of costs of banks in resolution and then the protection of depositors in bail-in and in the Deposit Guarantee Schemes. The primary method used in the burden-sharing arrangement is bail-in, in which the shareholders and creditors of a bank are the first ones to bear losses. The deposits of natural persons and SMEs bear losses after other creditors, and the last ones to bear losses are the Deposit Guarantee Schemes, which cover losses in lieu of covered deposits. A central element of the Single Resolution Mechanism is the Single Resolution Fund, which will be used to cover losses after a bail-in of 8 % of the total liabilities of the bank. In addition to the Single Resolution Fund, the burden-sharing arrangement is supported by the direct recapitalization instrument of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). Legal scholars have presented conflicting views on the effectiveness of bail-in, and the new regime may entail risks to taxpayers. However, the negative effects of bail-in seem smaller than the effects of bailouts, so the introduction of bail-in in the burden-sharing system can be deemed an improvement compared to the current situation. The Single Resolution Fund can also improve the position of taxpayers, since the Fund can prevent or at least reduce the need for taxpayers’ funds in the resolution of a bank. However, the target size of the Fund and the long transition period may impair the effectiveness of the Fund. Legal scholars have questioned the effectiveness of bail-in and the Single Resolution Fund especially in a systemic crisis. Because of the uncertainty associated with these instruments as well as the problems concerning the ESM direct recapitalization instrument the position of taxpayers remains risky, and the possibility of bailing out banks with taxpayers’ money cannot be fully excluded. On the other hand, the Banking Union is still work in progress, so the robustness of these instruments remains to be tested. The protection of depositors in bail-in has been ensured in several ways: the deposits of natural persons and <b>SMEs</b> have been <b>granted</b> preference in the order of loss absorption over shareholders and other creditors. The deposits can also be excluded from bail-in under exceptional circumstances. Additionally, deposits not exceeding EUR 100 000 are fully protected from bail-in. The new Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive will improve the protection of depositors in multiple ways. The Directive will provide more consistent level of protection in the Member States and confirms EUR 100 000 as the level of guarantee coverage. The Directive will gradually reduce the payout period of covered deposits from the current 20 working days to 7 working days by 2024. The Directive will establish consistent rules on the funding of Deposit Guarantee Schemes, which will be threefold and the target level of which will be 0. 8 % of covered deposits by 3 rd July 2024. The Directive will also improve the conveyance of information to depositors on Deposit Guarantee Schemes and facilitate the payout process. The Directive will also promote the equal treatment of depositors. The Directive will therefore improve the protection of depositors remarkably and may increase depositors’ confidence in Deposit Guarantee Schemes. The provisions also entail some risks, such as the option of deferral concerning the payout of certain deposits, which, if interpreted broadly, may impair the protection of those depositors to whom the provision applies and place them in a weaker position than other depositors. A major downside of the new Directive {{is the fact that it}} maintains national Deposit Guarantee Schemes and will not introduce an EU wide or at least a euro zone wide common Deposit Guarantee Scheme, which would be much more effective in terms of depositor protection than multiple national ones. The introduction of a common Deposit Guarantee Schemes should be considered in the future, although its introduction does not seem very likely at the moment...|$|R
