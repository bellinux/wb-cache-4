5|$|Harding {{had urged}} {{regulation}} of radio broadcasting in his April 1921 speech to Congress. Commerce Secretary Hoover {{took charge of}} this project, and convened a conference of radio broadcasters in 1922, {{which led to a}} voluntary agreement for licensing of radio frequencies through the Commerce Department. Both Harding and Hoover realized <b>something</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> an agreement was needed, but Congress was slow to act, not imposing radio regulation until 1927.|$|E
5|$|The Grinch realizes {{then that}} Christmas is <b>something</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> its trappings. The book criticizes {{the commercialization of}} Christmas and satirizes those who exploit the holiday. The tale was adapted into a 1966 short {{animated}} film for television with a screenplay by Seuss and narration by Boris Karloff. Later adaptations include a Broadway musical and a feature film in 2000 starring Jim Carrey.|$|E

5|$|When a party {{calling itself}} Conservative {{can think of}} {{nothing better than to}} outbid the Government's {{election}} promises; when it demands economy in one breath and increased spending in the next; when it proposes an immediate tax cut regardless of inflationary results... when in short, the Conservative party no longer gives us a conservative alternative after twenty-one years... then our political system desperately requires an opposition prepared to stand for <b>something</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the improbable chance of quick victory.|$|E
5|$|David's first book, A Book of Mediterranean Food, {{frequently}} {{referred to}} by the abbreviated title of Mediterranean Food, was published by John Lehmann in 1950, only a year after David's first articles had started appearing in British periodicals. The original typescript of the book consisted almost entirely of reused versions of her recent articles. It was submitted to and turned down {{by a series of}} publishers, one of whom told her that it needed <b>something</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> just the bare recipes. David took note, and wrote some linking text, interspersing her own brief prose with relevant excerpts {{from a wide range of}} authors known for their writings about the Mediterranean. They included Norman Douglas, Lawrence Durrell, Gertrude Stein, D. H. Lawrence, Osbert Sitwell, Compton Mackenzie, Arnold Bennett, Henry James and Théophile Gautier.|$|E
5|$|The tale shows Potter at {{her best}} in {{depicting}} {{the life of}} the farm and the village of Near Sawrey, but the tale becomes one of <b>something</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> just local colour and interest. The archetypical tale upon which Jemima is based– the foolish and naive are rescued from destruction by the loyal and dependable– is transformed in Potter's hands to one in which self-preservation and shrewdness become admirable virtues. Graham Greene thought the sandy-whiskered gentleman a character of ominous gloom and suggested Potter had suffered some sort of mental breakdown, but it is more likely she was simply coming to terms with life on a farm. Wild animals invade the precincts of the domesticated ones, and death is part of farming.|$|E

25|$|In 1794 the Society of United Irishmen {{became a}} sworn association, using oaths that clearly {{aimed at the}} {{overthrow}} of the state. Given that France and Britain had been at war since the French Revolutionary Wars of early 1793, administering or making such oaths turned the society into <b>something</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a liberal pressure-group.|$|E

25|$|There were no Dukes {{made between}} William the Conqueror and Henry II; they were {{themselves}} only Dukes in France. When Edward III of England declared himself King of France, {{he made his}} sons Dukes, to distinguish them from other noblemen, much as Royal Dukes are now distinguished from other Dukes. Later Kings created Marquesses and Viscounts to make finer gradations of honour: a rank <b>something</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> an Earl and something less than an Earl, respectively.|$|E
25|$|To {{those who}} believe that {{consciousness}} entails <b>something</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> behaving in all ways conscious, Dennett's view is seen as eliminativist, since it denies the existence of qualia and the possibility of philosophical zombies. However, Dennett is not denying the existence of the mind or of consciousness, only what he considers a naive view of them. The point of contention is whether Dennett's own definitions are indeed more accurate, whether what we think of when we speak of perceptions and consciousness can be understood in terms of nothing more than their effect on behaviour.|$|E

25|$|Straznicky died in 1876, and J. Carson Brevoort, a trustee, {{was chosen}} to be superintendent. In February 1878, Brevoort resigned. His {{successor}} was Robbins Little, a graduate of Yale. He retained the position as superintendent until 1896, after the 1895 consolidation. That the library was considered <b>something</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a local institution was demonstrated in 1878 when the United States Sanitary Commission, having completed its task, donated its archives to the library for safe keeping. The archives consisted of all its correspondence, reports, account books, hospital directories, printed reports, histories, maps and charts, claims of some 51,000 soldiers and sailors investigated by it, miscellaneous papers, etc. The library promised {{that they would be}} preserved and accessible to the public.|$|E
25|$|Several {{people have}} pointed out more or less {{significant}} areas where Lewis' Outline is {{not consistent with the}} text of The Chronicles. Paul Ford, author of Companion to Narnia, points out that the text of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe states that Lucy and Edmund are one year apart in age, the years given in the timeline for their births, 1930 and 1932 respectively, would put their ages at <b>something</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a year. Devin Brown, author of Inside Narnia: A Guide to Exploring The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, uses the timeline as a way to reconcile some of the statements concerning the timing of Aslan's appearances in Narnia with other characters' recollection of those appearances.|$|E

[...] The article, featured on the Yahoo! website Shine, also criticized the books and the author's final word on the series was, [...] "Good books deal with themes of longing and loneliness, sexual passion and human frailty, alienation and fear just as the Twilight books do. But they do so by engaging us with complexities of feeling and subtleties of character, expressed in language that rises above banal mediocrity. Their reward is <b>something</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> just an escape into banal mediocrity. We deserve something better to get hooked on." ...|$|E
500|$|Admitting {{that the}} {{existence}} of qualia seems obvious, Dennett nevertheless states that [...] "qualia" [...] is a theoretical term from an outdated metaphysics stemming from Cartesian intuitions. He argues that a precise analysis shows that the term is in the long run empty and full of contradictions. The eliminativist's claim with respect to qualia {{is that there is no}} unbiased evidence for such experiences when regarded as <b>something</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> propositional attitudes. In other words, they do not deny that pain exists, but that it exists independently of its effect on behavior. Influenced by Ludwig Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations, Dennett and Rey have defended eliminativism about qualia, even when other portions of the mental are accepted.|$|E
