25|$|One of Chrome's {{differentiating}} features is the New Tab Page, {{which can}} replace the browser home page and is displayed {{when a new}} tab is created. Originally, this showed thumbnails of the nine most visited web sites, along with frequent searches, recent bookmarks, and recently closed tabs; similar to Internet Explorer and Firefox with Google Toolbar, or Opera's <b>Speed</b> <b>Dial.</b> In Google Chrome 2.0, the New Tab Page was updated to allow users to hide thumbnails {{they did not want}} to appear.|$|E
25|$|From the Riga to Minox B, {{the film}} counter counts up to 50, while from Minox BL, C, to TLX, the film counter counts down from 36/30/15. For {{mechanical}} Minox 8x11 cameras, a separate shutter <b>speed</b> <b>dial</b> sets the shutter speed from 1/2 to 1/1000 second, plus B and T (BL has no documented T). For electromagnetic shutter cameras, the shutter dial starts with 1/15 sec, {{and ends with}} 1/1000 (Minox C), or starts with 1/30 and ends with 1/2000 (Minox LX/TLX/CLX); the electromagnetic Minox camera also has an 'A' setting for automatic exposure, controlled by the built-in CdS (Minox C) or Spd (Minox LX/TLX) exposure meter.|$|E
25|$|There was no {{immediate}} search and seizure {{as a result of}} the first program. Although five cases were heard by two judges at that point, any judge could have secured potential evidence without waiting for the combining of the cases. Opposition parties criticized the lack of immediate action, attributing it to government-appointed chief of prosecutors Alejandra Gils Carbó. Several neighbours reported on April 17 that documentation was removed from the Madero Center (the alleged location of La Rosadita) over a several-hour period; a search and seizure was conducted the following day. Casanello requisitioned security-camera tapes to ascertain if documents were removed before the operation, and the investigation suggested that information may have been erased from computers between the first program and the search-and-seizure operation. It was discovered that Austral Construcciones (owned by Lázaro Báez and operating with large sums of money) was a client of La Rosadita and its telephones had Báez on <b>speed</b> <b>dial.</b> The son of Daniel Pérez Gadín (Báez's accountant) was identified in the security tapes as one of the men removing papers, boxes and file folders before the search and seizure; Casanello opened a separate investigation.|$|E

2500|$|All Oldsmobiles {{featured}} the [...] "speed bar" [...] speedometer. [...] Introduced in 1959, the speedometer used a rolling black cylinder with sections painted brilliant green, yellow and bright red. [...] As the car {{went from a}} standing stop forward in speed, the cylinder rolled, first exposing the green in a window that matched the numeric speed on stationary <b>speed</b> <b>dial</b> for low speeds, yellow at moderate speeds, and finally red at highway speeds. [...] Drivers who topped the car over 100mph moved the cylinder into an area where only the black base color was visible. [...] For 1963, Oldsmobile would revert to a standard speed needle sweeping over a calibrated set of speeds instead.|$|E
2500|$|Gudas' {{style of}} play has {{resulted}} in criticism, ejections, injuries to opposing players, and subsequent reviews and suspensions from the NHL's Department of Player Safety. NBC Sports writer James O’Brien noted Gudas’ growing list of indiscretions in late 2016, writing that “If the Department of Player Safety had a <b>speed</b> <b>dial</b> list of regulars, Gudas would have a prominent spot on it.” Hockey writers have described him as reckless and as a player who consistently demonstrates no regard for opponents in vulnerable positions. As {{a member of the}} Flyers, he has been referred to by the Philadelphia sports press as a player who “represents everything that the Flyers once were and should no longer aspire to be”, as well as “a cheap-shot aficionado, reckless, careless, damaging to the Flyers' chances of winning and to other athletes' health and safety, a player who can't be trusted by either his teammates or his opponents to play a tough, clean game.” ...|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the process of}} designing and executing an empirical study aboutautomotive Head Up-Displays (HUDs). It also relates the process that follows ofdesigning a concept HUD according {{to the results of}} the study. The project was split into three chronological parts: analysis, synthesis and evaluation. Inthe analysis phase, a large scale study was performed on available literature concerningHUDs. Also, a study that aimed to investigate peoples willingness to use HUD wascompleted. This study was designed as a pre-study for a later project. The study wasperformed on seven test subjects who drove their own cars with a HUD mounted in them,in real traffic for four days each. The results of the study indicate that the subjects are likely to find HUD useful inautomotive appliances, and furthermore, the study gave indications of the features thatwere important to them. For example, many preferred analogue <b>speed</b> <b>dials</b> as opposed todigital ones. Using systematic design, a concept HUD was produced using the findings from the study,as well as earlier findings made in other studies. In order to find suitable symbols for thedifferent messages to be conveyed by the HUD, a survey was carried out. The surveyasked the participants which symbol they thought was the best purveyor of each message. The concept formed features both analogue and digital <b>speed</b> <b>dials,</b> as well as a dial toindicate acceleration. It has navigation system features and traffic warnings. It also showsturn indicators and system failure warnings, such as engine and brake malfunction. The conclusions of this project are that a solely digital speedometer may be disliked bymany drivers, and therefore it is suggested that a combination of digital and analoguemight be better. Also, the optimal position of the HUD is not necessarily directly in frontof the steering wheel, with several subjects preferring the HUD positioned slightly to theright of the steering wheel.

40|$|This paper {{explains}} {{the historical development of}} analogue and digital speedometer dial designs using the linguistics theory base of pragmatics, which asks researchers {{to explain a}} visual design by describing its purpose as well as how its various visual features meet people¿s needs, how people read dials and how people use dials to coordinate with one another or machines. The paper is useful for researchers interested in methodologies for studying the development of language-like visual communication, and for those interested in the history of information graphics, machine interfaces or speedometer dials in particular. A range of dial designs from the early 1900 s to the current day are described and analyzed. In this paper, results show that drivers read speedometers to avoid fines, keep safe, change gears, set cruise control or record high speeds. Designs also, however, serve marketing and aesthetic purposes. Features of analogue displays are described with the paper concluding with a taxonomy of dial features. The entire system of speed containment could be improved since even with easy-to-read dials, drivers continue to <b>speed.</b> <b>Dials</b> that work with satellite systems to continually display the current speed limit may be the way of the future...|$|R

Bharti Telecom Limited (BTL) was incorporated and entered into a technical tie up with Siemens AG of Germany for manufacture of electronic push button phones. By the early 1990s, Sunil was making fax machines, cordless phones and other telecom gear. Sunil says, [...] "In 1983, the government imposed {{a ban on the}} import of gensets. I was out of business overnight. Everything I was doing came to a screeching halt. I was in trouble. The question then was: what should I do next? Then, opportunity came calling. While in Taiwan, I noticed the popularity of the push-button phone -- something which India hadn't seen then. We were still using those rotary <b>dials</b> with no <b>speed</b> <b>dials</b> or redials. I sensed my chance and embraced the telecom business.
