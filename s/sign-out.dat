50|$|The 21st century {{ushered in}} the {{acceptance}} and encouragement of internet research conducted on college and university campuses, in homes, and even in gathering areas of shopping centers. Addition of cyber cafes on campuses and coffee shops, loaning of communication devices from libraries, and availability of more portable technology devices, opened up a world of educational resources. Availability of knowledge to the elite had always been obvious, yet provision of networking devices, even wireless gadget <b>sign-outs</b> from libraries, made availability of information an expectation of most persons. Cassandra B. Whyte researched the future of computer use on higher education campuses focusing on student affairs. Though at first seen as a data collection and outcome reporting tool, the use of computer technology in the classrooms, meeting areas, and homes continued to unfold. The sole dependence on paper resources for subject information diminished and e-books and articles, as well as on-line courses, were anticipated to become increasingly staple and affordable choices provided by higher education institutions according to Whyte in a 2002 presentation.|$|R
40|$|Patient handovers are a {{critical}} point in the patient care process. Software to identify differences in communication content and strategies across different types of patient handovers could be helpful in customizing physician training programs. To determine whether there were differences, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software was used. The primary measure was the LIWC output score, which is the frequency of mention of words in a construct category divided {{by the total number}} of words in the handover transcript. Two types of constructs were investigated: 1) content, which included name/age, care plan, prognosis, and family, and 2) strategy, which included questioning and collaborative cross-checks. We hypothesized that the Emergency Department (ED) to hospital transfer compared to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) <b>sign-outs</b> would have more discussion of family and less of the patient’s prognosis, as well as more collaborative cross-checks. A two-tailed t-test was used to detect differences. One hypothesis was confirmed, that there was less discussion of prognosis in the ED as compared to the ICU handover. Unexpected findings were less discussion of the care plan and more questioning in the ED as compared to the ICU handover. Findings confirm that both communication content and strategies are different for the two types of patient handovers and that an automated analysis approach can detect differences across a set of handover transcripts...|$|R
40|$|Background: Transfer of clinic {{patients}} from graduating residents to interns or junior residents occurs every year, affecting {{large numbers of}} patients. Breaches in care continuity may occur, with potential for risk to patient safety. Several guidelines {{have been developed for}} implementing standardized inpatient <b>sign-outs,</b> but no specific guidelines exist for outpatient handover. Methods: Residents in primary care programs – internal medicine, family medicine, and pediatrics – at a US academic medical center were invited to participate in an online survey. The invitation was extended approximately 2 years after electronic medical record (EMR) rollout began at the institution. Results: Of 71 eligible residents, 22 (31 %) responded to the survey. Of these, 18 felt that handover of ambulatory patients was at least moderately important – but only one affirmed the existence of a system for handover. IM residents perceived that they had the highest proportion of high-risk patients (p= 0. 042); transition-of-care letters were more important to IM residents than other respondents (p= 0. 041). Conclusion: There is room for improvement in resident acknowledgement of handover processes in continuity clinics. In this study, IM residents attached greater importance to a specific handover tool than other primary care residents. Thus, the different primary care specialties may need to have different handover tools available to them within a shared EMR system...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The “Swiss cheese model” {{of systems}} {{accidents}} is commonly applied to patient safety, implying that many “holes” must align before an adverse event occurs. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) instituted work hour limitations to fill one such hole by reducing resident fatigue. OBJECTIVE: The {{objective of this}} study was to determine how residents perceive the impact of the ACGME rules and other factors on patient safety. DESIGN: The study was designed as a focus group study. PARTICIPANTS: Participating in the study were 28 internal medicine residents, of whom 13 were from a university-based program that includes both an academic medical center and a Veterans Affair (VA) hospital, 9 were from a community-based program, and 6 were from a freestanding medical college that includes a large private teaching hospital and a VA hospital. MEASUREMENT: Grounded theory analysis was used to examine transcripts of the focus group discussions. RESULTS: A model of contributors to patient care errors emerged including fatigue, inexperience, <b>sign-outs,</b> not knowing patients, “entropy” (which we defined as “overall chaos in the system”), and workload. Participants described the impact of both intended and unintended consequences of the work hour rules on patient care. Residents reported improved well-being and less fatigue, but had concern about the effect of reduced continuity on patient care. CONCLUSION: Our focus group participants perceived that the ACGME work hour limitations had minimized the impact of resident fatigue on patient care errors. Other contributors to errors remained and were often exacerbated by methods to maintain compliance with the rules. Journal of Hospital Medicine 2008; 3 : 228 – 237...|$|R

5000|$|Mount Stevens, a {{relatively}} small peak, is located here. Although very small by Adirondack standards, it nevertheless has at least three marked trails to the summit. Though technically not part of Camp Read, at least some have theorized that Read may nevertheless be able to lay claim to it via the doctrine of adverse possession. Mount Stevens {{has been used as}} a sort of [...] "proving ground" [...] where experienced voyageurs have taken new voyageurs for intense compressed training. Particular care is emphasized in cooking a perfect Denver omelet. The extent of jurisdiction that the Camp is able to exercise over camp personnel on Stevens is still undecided. For instance, during a summer when a camper broke his ankle on the summit, the camp coordinated with local authorities to launch a rescue operation. Ultimately, a helicopter was involved. Yet, perhaps paradoxically, anyone climbing Mt Stevens that chooses to access the trailhead from camp must <b>sign-out.</b> The extent of jurisdiction is further muddied by the fact that summit base staff have been tasked with repairing footbridges, and marking trails that lead to the summit. Finally, at least in the past, the crucible event for those participating in the Wilderness Survival merit badge at camp involved climbing Mt Stevens and constructing a shelter. Interestingly, the lack of any real substantial foliage on the summit never seemed to be a factor. While it is likely that the true ownership and conflict between Camp law and that of NYS will never be resolved, there have been comparatively few flare ups.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Sign-out</b> is a {{mechanism}} of transferring information, responsibility, and authority from {{one set of}} caregivers to another. In teaching hospitals, <b>sign-out</b> between resident physicians has a long tradition. Because {{of the need to}} reduce the number of hours residents spend in the hospital, the number of sign-outs has increased, while continuity of care during hospital stays has decreased. As a result, when caring for hospitalized patients, residents have become increasingly dependent upon exchange of information during <b>sign-out.</b> Despite its critical importance, little research has examined the content, process, and effectiveness of resident <b>sign-out.</b> Even less is known about how <b>sign-out</b> should be conducted or how interventions might improve the quality of <b>sign-out.</b> Methods: Between October 2005 and February 2006, and again between October 2006 and February 2007, residents completed a post-call survey immediately after a call shift; we also audio-recorded <b>sign-out</b> sessions. Results: At baseline, an unexpected event arose during one-third of call shifts that should have been anticipated and discussed during <b>sign-out.</b> Recordings demonstrated <b>sign-out</b> was informal and unstructured with very wide variation in the type and extent of information exchanged.

Our {{experiences with the}} transition are described, including attending pathologist, trainee, support staff, and clinician satisfaction. A survey was e-mailed to all University of Vermont Medical Center anatomic pathology attendings, pathology trainees, pathologist assistants and grossing technicians, and clinicians who send surgical pathology specimens, immediately before and 1 year after transitioning to partial subspecialty <b>sign-out.</b> Quality assurance metrics were obtained for the 18 months prior to and following the transition. Gastrointestinal and breast/cervix attendings were more satisfied with partial subspecialty <b>sign-out</b> compared to those on the general benches. Overall, trainees were more satisfied with general <b>sign-out</b> because of the rotation schedule but preferred partial subspecialty <b>sign-out</b> due to improved teaching and more focused learning while on subspecialty benches. Clinicians remained very satisfied with our department and our reports; no differences were observed. Turnaround time was unchanged. After switching to partial subspecialty <b>sign-out,</b> there were significantly fewer discrepancies following multidisciplinary conference review for gastrointestinal and breast/cervix cases but remained the same for general cases.

METHOD: To describe the importance and accessibility of clinical information used by on-call residents in covering hospital patients, we administered a questionnaire. Then following {{the use of a}} new computerized <b>sign-out</b> system in one of the programs, residents filled out the same questionnaire again. RESULTS: Residents felt that a "to do" list and information about the patient's "code status" were the most important data desired from <b>sign-out</b> sheets. However, 69 % of residents in both programs felt that provision of this information was normally poor. Nearly all of the residents in Buffalo, using an entirely handwritten <b>sign-out</b> sheet, felt it was in need of improvement. Residents in Pittsburgh, using a summary aided by the hospital's computer print-out, felt this need much less acutely. After implementation of a new computerized <b>sign-out</b> sheet in Buffalo, residents indicated a slightly higher level of satisfaction. The work of data entry and re-entry into the computer was unpopular and inefficient. CONCLUSION: The present method of transferring information {{at the end of a}} work day is not satisfactory for residents. Provision of data summaries from existing hospital information systems is a good first step in improving data transfer.

40|$|Background: The {{adoption}} of digital pathology offers benefits over labor-intensive, time-consuming, and error-prone manual processes. However, because most workflow and laboratory transactions are {{centered around the}} anatomical pathology laboratory information system (APLIS), {{adoption of}} digital pathology ideally requires integration with the APLIS. A digital pathology system (DPS) integrated with the APLIS was recently implemented at our institution for diagnostic use. We demonstrate how such integration supports digital workflow to <b>sign-out</b> anatomical pathology cases. Methods: Workflow begins when pathology cases get accessioned into the APLIS (CoPathPlus). Glass slides from these cases are then digitized (Omnyx VL 120 scanner) and automatically uploaded into the DPS (Omnyx; Integrated Digital Pathology (IDP) software v. 1. 3). The APLIS transmits case data to the DPS via a publishing web service. The DPS associates scanned images with the correct case using barcode labels on slides and information received from the APLIS. When pathologists remotely open a case in the DPS, additional information (e. g. gross pathology details, prior cases) gets retrieved from the APLIS through a query web service. Results: Following validation of this integration, pathologists at our institution have signed out more than 1000 surgical pathology cases in a production environment. Integration between the APLIS and DPS enabled pathologists to review digital slides while simultaneously having access to pertinent case metadata. The introduction of a digital workflow eliminated costly manual tasks involving matching of glass slides and avoided delays waiting for glass slides to be delivered. Conclusion: Integrating the DPS and APLIS were instrumental for successfully implementing a digital solution at our institution for pathology <b>sign-out.</b> The integration streamlined our digital <b>sign-out</b> workflow, diminished the potential for human error related to matching slides, and improved the <b>sign-out</b> experience for pathologists...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION Several years ago, the Department of Pediatrics at the State University of New York at Buffalo {{introduced}} a resident <b>sign-out</b> database 1.

40|$|Abstract Background Only prototypes 5 years ago, high-speed, {{automated}} whole slide imaging (WSI) systems (also called digital slide systems, virtual microscopes or wide field imagers) {{are becoming}} increasingly capable and robust. Modern devices can capture a slide in 5 minutes at spatial sampling periods of less than 0. 5 micron/pixel. The capacity to rapidly digitize large numbers of slides should eventually have a profound, positive impact on pathology. It is important, however, that pathologists validate these systems during development, not only to identify their limitations but to guide their evolution. Methods Three pathologists fully signed out 25 cases representing 31 parts. The laboratory information system was used to simulate real-world <b>sign-out</b> conditions including entering a full diagnostic field and comment (when appropriate) and ordering special stains and recuts. For each case, discrepancies between diagnoses were documented by committee and a "consensus" report was formed and then compared with the microscope-based, <b>sign-out</b> report from the clinical archive. Results In 17 of 25 cases there were no discrepancies between the individual study pathologist reports. In 8 of the remaining cases, there were 12 discrepancies, including 3 in which image quality could be at least partially implicated. When the WSI consensus diagnoses were compared with the original <b>sign-out</b> diagnoses, no significant discrepancies were found. Full text of the pathologist reports, the WSI consensus diagnoses, and the original <b>sign-out</b> diagnoses are available as an attachment to this publication. Conclusion The {{results indicated that the}} image information contained in current whole slide images is sufficient for pathologists to make reliable diagnostic decisions and compose complex diagnostic reports. This is a very positive result; however, {{this does not mean that}} WSI is as good as a microscope. Virtually every slide had focal areas in which image quality (focus and dynamic range) was less than perfect. In some cases, there was evidence of over-compression and regions made "soft" by less than perfect focus. We expect systems will continue to get better, image quality and speed will continue to improve, but that further validation studies will be needed to guide development of this promising technology. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{story is}} not new. America’s {{emergency}} departments (EDs) are frequently overcrowded, their ability to provide high quality emergency care compromised by lack of space and required attention to admitted patients boarding in the ED, awaiting a hospital bed upstairs.

40|$|Background: In {{resident}} {{primary care}} continuity clinics, {{at the end}} of each academic year, continuity of care is disrupted when patients cared for by the graduating class are redistributed to other residents. Yet, despite the recent focus on the transfers of care between resident physicians in inpatient settings, there has been minimal attention given to patient care transfers in academic ambulatory clinics. We sought to elicit the views of pediatric residents regarding year-end patient handoffs in a pediatric resident continuity clinic. Methods: Residents assigned to a continuity clinic of a large pediatric residency program completed a questionnaire regarding year-end transfers of care. Results: Thirty-one questionnaires were completed out of a total 45 eligible residents (69 % response). Eighty seven percent of residents strongly or somewhat agreed that it would be useful to receive a written <b>sign-out</b> for patients with complex medical or social issues, but only 35 % felt it would be useful for patients with no significant issues. Residents more frequently reported having access to adequate information regarding their new patients&#x 2019; medical summary (53 %) and care plan (47 %) than patients&#x 2019; functional abilities (30 %), social history (17 %), or use of community resources (17 %). When rating the importance of receiving adequate <b>sign-out</b> in each those domains, residents gave most importance to the medical summary (87 % of residents indicating very or somewhat important) and plan of care (84 %). Residents gave less importance to receiving <b>sign-out</b> regarding their patients&#x 2019; functional abilities (71 %) social history (58 %), and community resources (58 %). Residents indicated that lack of access to adequate patient information resulted in additional work (80 %), delays or omissions in needed care (56 %), and disruptions in continuity of care (58 %).

40|$|Objectives: <b>Sign-out</b> (SO) is a {{challenge}} to the emergency physician. Some training programs have instituted overlapping 9 -hour shifts. The residents see patients for eight hours, and have one hour of wrap-up time. This hour helps them complete patient care, leaving fewer patients to <b>sign-out.</b> We examined whether this strategy impacts SO burden. Methods: This is a retrospective review of patients evaluated by emergency medicine (EM) residents working 9 -hour (eight hours of patient care, one hour wrap-up time) and 12 -hour shifts (12 hours patient care, no reserved time for wrap-up). Data were collected by reviewing the clinical tracker. A patient was assigned to the resident who initiated care and dictated the chart. SO was defined as any patient in the ED without disposition at change of shift. Patient turn-around-time (TAT) was also recorded. Results: One-hundred sixty-one postgraduate-year-one resident (PGY 1), 264 postgraduate-yeartwo resident (PGY 2), and 193 postgraduate-year-three resident (PGY 3) shifts were included. PGY 1 s signed out 1. 9 patients per 12 -hour shift. PGY 2 s signed out 2. 3 patients on 12 -hour shifts and 1. 8 patients on 9 -hour shifts.

Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to evaluate compliance of checklist completion and its barrier for utilization at University of Gondar Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia. Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted among 282 patients undergoing elective and emer-gency surgery from January to March 2013. Compliance and completeness rate with implementation of Sign-in, Time-out, and <b>Sign-out</b> domains was computed with SPSS 20 package. Results: A total of 282 operations were performed and checklists were utilized in 39. 7 % (112 / 282) of cases. Among these, most checklists were employed during emergency procedures (61. 6 %) that need general anesthesia (75. 9 %) in department of surgery (58. 9 %). The overall compliance and completeness rate were 39. 7 and 63. 4 % respectively. The sign-in, time-out and <b>sign-out</b> were missed in 30. 5 % (273 / 896), 35. 4 % (436 / 1, 232) and 45. 7 % (307 / 672) respectively. The main reasons cited for non-user were lack of previous training (45. 1 %) and lack of cooperation among surgical team members (21. 6 %). Conclusions and recommendations: The completeness rate was satisfactory but the overall compliance rate wa...|$|E
40|$|Our {{group has}} {{developed}} a computer system that supports all phases of the inpatient discharge process. The system fills {{in most of the}} physician's discharge order form and the nurse's discharge abstract, using information available from <b>sign-out,</b> order entry, scheduling, and other databases. It supplies information for referrals to outside institutions, and provides a variety of instruction materials for patients. Discharge forms can be completed in advance, so that the patient is not waiting for final paperwork. Physicians and nurses can work on their components independently, rather than in series. Response to the system has been very favorable...|$|E
40|$|An iterative, {{multifaceted}} {{approach with}} users – even busy ones – can yield a satisfying and efficient product. A USER-CENTERED APPROACH IS CRITICAL {{in the development}} of new process support tools, but engaging end users can be challenging (Hooper, 1986). Users may not always be able to articulate their problems or point to their root causes; they may jump to potential solutions before truly understanding the underlying issues; and they may not be available during typical work hours to discuss problems with their tools. In this article, we describe a multifaceted approach that combines focus groups, interviews, iterative prototyping, test-ing, and feedback for engaging one such group of end users – resident physicians – in the design process for a <b>sign-out</b> sup-port tool. Suggested improvements are based on task analysis methods comparing the work flow found with the existing and redesigned tools, and practical strategies are discussed for increasing end user involvement in the design process. BACKGROUND <b>Sign-out</b> (that is, when outgoing physicians hand off patient care to incoming physicians) is a critical process in hos-pital settings (Borowitz, Waggoner-Fountain, Bass, & Sledd, 2008). Residents ’ duty hours are restricted to 30 continuous hours and 80 total hours per week, accompanied by 10 -hour rest periods away from patient care (Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, n. d.). As a result of these restric-tions, the number of sign-outs between resident physicians has increased, along with concern for their effect on continu...|$|E
40|$|Whole slide imaging {{is being}} used {{increasingly}} in research applications and in frozen section, consultation and external quality assurance practice. Digital pathology, when integrated with other digital tools such as barcoding, specimen tracking and digital dictation, can {{be integrated into the}} histopathology workflow, from specimen accession to report <b>sign-out.</b> These elements can bring about improvements in the safety, quality and efficiency of a histopathology department. The present paper reviews the evidence for these benefits. We then discuss the challenges of implementing a fully digital pathology workflow, including the regulatory environment, validation of whole slide imaging and the evidence for the design of a digital pathology workstation...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Full {{implementation}} of safety checklists in surgery {{has been linked}} to improved outcomes and team effectiveness; however, reliable and standardized tools for assessing the quality of their use, which is likely to moderate their impact, are required. STUDY DESIGN: This was a multicenter prospective study. A standardized observational instrument, the "Checklist Usability Tool" (CUT), was developed to record precise characteristics relating {{to the use of the}} WHO's surgical safety checklist (SSC) at "time-out" and "sign-out" in a representative sample of 5 English hospitals. The CUT was used in real-time by trained assessors across general surgery, urology, and orthopaedic cases, including elective and emergency procedures. RESULTS: We conducted 565 and 309 observations of the time-out and <b>sign-out,</b> respectively. On average, two-thirds of the items were checked, team members were absent in more than 40 % of cases, and they failed to pause or focus on the checks in more than 70 % of cases. Information sharing could be improved across the entire operating room (OR) team. <b>Sign-out</b> was not completed in 39 % of cases, largely due to uncertainty about when to conduct it. Large variation in checklist use existed between hospitals, but not between surgical specialties or between elective and emergency procedures. Surgical safety checklist performance was better when surgeons led and when all team members were present and paused. CONCLUSIONS: We found large variation in WHO checklist use in a representative sample of English ORs. Measures sensitive to checklist practice quality, like CUT, will help identify areas for improvement in implementation and enable provision of comprehensive feedback to OR teams...|$|E
