Larger amounts of radioactive material were later isolated from coral debris of the atoll, which were delivered to the U.S. The separation of suspected new elements was carried out {{in the presence of a}} citric acid/ammonium buffer solution in a weakly acidic medium (pH ≈ 3.5), using ion exchange at elevated temperatures; fewer than 200 atoms of einsteinium were recovered in the end. Nevertheless, element 99 (einsteinium), namely its 253Es isotope, could be detected via its characteristic high-energy alpha decay at 6.6MeV. It was produced by the capture of 15 neutrons by uranium-238 nuclei followed by seven beta-decays, and had a half-life of 20.5 days. Such multiple neutron absorption was made possible by the high neutron flux density during the detonation, so that newly generated heavy isotopes had plenty of available neutrons to absorb before they could disintegrate into lighter elements. Neutron capture initially raised the mass number without changing the atomic number of the nuclide, and the concomitant beta-decays resulted in a gradual increase in the atomic number: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{two main}} {{standalone}} spectroscopy techniques for forensic chemistry are FTIR and AA spectroscopy. [...] FTIR is a nondestructive process that uses infrared light {{to identify a}} substance. [...] The attenuated total reflectance <b>sampling</b> <b>technique</b> {{eliminates the need for}} substances to be prepared before analysis. [...] The combination of nondestructiveness and zero preparation makes ATR FTIR analysis a quick and easy first step in the analysis of unknown substances. [...] To facilitate the positive identification of the substance, FTIR instruments are loaded with databases that can be searched for known spectra that match the unknown's spectra. [...] FTIR analysis of mixtures, while not impossible, presents specific difficulties due to the cumulative nature of the response. [...] When analyzing an unknown that contains more than one substance, the resulting spectra will be a combination of the individual spectra of each component. [...] While common mixtures have known spectra on file, novel mixtures can be difficult to resolve, making FTIR an unacceptable means of identification. [...] However, the instrument can be used to determine the general chemical structures present, allowing forensic chemists to determine the best method for analysis with other instruments. [...] For example, a methoxy group will result in a peak between 3,030 and 2,950 wavenumbers (cm−1).|$|E

2500|$|When {{the state}} {{transition}} and observation models—that is, the predict and update functions [...] and —are highly non-linear, the extended Kalman filter can give particularly poor performance. This {{is because the}} covariance is propagated through linearization of the underlying non-linear model. The unscented Kalman filter (UKF) uses a deterministic <b>sampling</b> <b>technique</b> known as the unscented transform to pick a minimal set of sample points (called sigma points) around the mean. These sigma points are then propagated through the non-linear functions, from which a new mean and covariance estimate are then formed. The result is a filter which, for certain systems, more accurately estimates the true mean and covariance. [...] This can be verified with Monte Carlo sampling or Taylor series expansion of the posterior statistics. [...] In addition, this technique removes the requirement to explicitly calculate Jacobians, which for complex functions can be a difficult task in itself (i.e., requiring complicated derivatives if done analytically or being computationally costly if done numerically), if not impossible (if those functions are not differentiable).|$|E

40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe {{choice of}} <b>sampling</b> <b>techniques</b> in {{bronchoscopy}} with sampling from a visible lesion {{will depend on}} the expected diagnostic yields and the costs of the <b>sampling</b> <b>techniques.</b> AimsThe aim {{of this study was to}} determine the most economical combination of <b>sampling</b> <b>techniques</b> when approaching endobronchial visible lesions. MethodsA cost minimization analysis was performed. All bronchoscopies from 2003 and 2004 at Haukeland university hospital, Bergen, Norway, were reviewed retrospectively for diagnostic yields. 162 patients with endobronchial disease were included. Potential <b>sampling</b> <b>techniques</b> used were biopsy, brushing, endobronchial needle aspiration (EBNA) and washings. Costs were estimated based on registration of equipment costs and personnel costs. Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine threshold values. ResultsThe combination of biopsy, brushing and EBNA was the most economical strategy with an average cost of Euro 893 (95 % CI: 657, 1336). The cost of brushing had to be below Euro 83 and it had to increase the diagnostic yield more than 2. 2 %, for biopsy and brushing to be more economical than biopsy alone. The combination of biopsy, brushing and EBNA was more economical than biopsy and brushing when the cost of EBNA was below Euro 205 and the increase in diagnostic yield was above 5. 2 %. ConclusionIn the current study setting, biopsy, brushing and EBNA was the most economical combination of <b>sampling</b> <b>techniques</b> for endobronchial visible lesions...|$|R
