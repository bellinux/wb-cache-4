We show that even in this case an estimation of the elasticity of substitution can be obtained. The empirical results are based on a French manufacturing energy consumption survey...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In non-thermal plasma—nanometer TiO 2 photocatalysis, the {{techniques}} of photocatalysis and plasma are combined, and do not need ultraviolet light. It can make use of <b>some</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> {{in the process of}} decomposing, {{while at the same time}} producing much free hydroxide and improving the efficiency of decomposing. It is regarded as one of the most promising technologies in air cleaning. A non-thermal plasma—nanometer TiO 2 photocatalysis purifier was placed in a stimulant air conditioning room, followed by pumping in a mixture of formaldehyde and air. The purifier was then turned on to carry on the static state experiment of decomposing formaldehyde. The INTERSCAN 4160 analysis instrument was adapted to analyze the variety of the formaldehyde density in the room. The fan was turned on in the room to keep the diffusion circulating in the room and alter the velocity of the air and the density for the experiment. The experiment shows that the efficiency of the decomposing formaldehyde in static state increased up to 90 % after the Non-thermal Plasma—Nanometer TiO 2 Photocatalysis process. In an air-conditioned room, the purifier can decrease the density of formaldehyde effectively. The concentration increasing effect of decomposing is more promising...|$|E

I Category: The subject is an agent having a will. The movement of the agent puts the target area under its control quantitatively or associates results of changing mastery over the area.

Ⅱ Category: The subject is not always an agent having a will, but any subject in this category is movable and has <b>some</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy.</b> It has agentivity though it is weaker than that of a subject in the I Category.

Ⅲ Category: The subject is not an agent having a will. Sentences in this category have an implication of directivity, which is the common point with the I and Ⅱ Categories. This category does not have transitivity. We conclude (1) movement verb constructions have several different levels of transitivity from high to zero and show hierarchy of the transitivity and (2) proposed three categories have common implication on directivity and are connected continuously...|$|E

40|$|In 1905, Einstein {{discovered}} the famous equation: E=mc^ 2, {{which means that}} the rest mass of a particle is <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy.</b> This energy is generally referred to as "rest energy", since the particle is believed to be at rest. This paper proposes a new interpretation to the term mc^ 2. Observing the similarity between the term mc^ 2 and the kinetic energy term mv^ 2 / 2, we propose to interpret mc^ 2 as being one term <b>of</b> kinetic <b>energy.</b> In other words we propose that, in the called "rest frame", the massive particles are not really at rest, but they are doing a special <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> motion at the light speed c. In this interpretation the "mass" is not an intrinsic property of the particle. The "mass" is simply the kinetic energy associated with this special <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> motion. The more important consequence of this hypothesis is that the term mc^ 2, present in the relativistic Hamiltonian, must be rewritten as: mc^ 2 => p_ 0 c, where p_ 0 = mc is the modulus of the instantaneous linear moment p⃗_ 0 associated with the special motion. We analyse a physical scenario in which this special motion is a Microscopic Orbital Circular Motion (MOCM). The characteristic length scale of the MOCM is of the order of the Compton wavelength of the particle. Comment: 9 pages, 2 figure...|$|R

One <b>of</b> the first <b>energy</b> crises that occurred in Sweden was as early as in 1760 when huge quantities of wood were needed to produce charcoal for the iron industry. Prices for wood increased dramatically and a solution had to be found. The prevailing heat source for houses of that time was open fireplaces or tile stoves. In 1766 Carl Johan Cronstedt and Fabian Wrede invented a new type of tile stove, where the flue gases went up and down through winding passages inside the stove. This invention increased the <b>energy</b> performance <b>of</b> the stove and reduced the amount of wood needed for heating. In 1767 a royal commission decided that all new tile stoves should be built like this. Better air tightness, insulation measures and interior windows were introduced. A consequence was that the first energy crisis could be solved. In the beginning of the 20 th century the fireplaces and tile stoves were often replaced by coal fired central heating systems, which made the energy system dependent on imported energy sources. Even though Sweden was not directly involved in any of the World Wars, the next crises came during and after WW I and II when Sweden, as well as all other Europea...|$|R

Thus renewed interest is being given to clean and environmentally friendly storage technologies such as compressed air, a technology more than a century old, and still being used in flammable and explosive industrial environments. New, improved compressors, air motors and advanced technologies and materials that can withstand large fluctuations in temperature have become available, and have been used by some innovative manufacturers to produce Hybrid Compressed Air Energy Storage (HCAES) Systems, which claim to have high turn around efficiencies. In this research, the available literature on compressed air systems, and new HCAES systems are evaluated in order to compare them to conventional storage technologies.

Each of these three predictions seemed so fantastic when it was made that everyone, including Einstein himself, regarded them as unlikely. Incredibly, all three {{have turned out to be}} true. Yet Einstein's legacy is one of deep mystery, because his theories are silent on three questions raised by his fantastic predictions: (1) What powered the Big Bang? (2) What happens to space, time, and matter at the edge of a black hole? (3) What is the mysterious dark energy pulling the Universe apart? The answers to these questions-which lie at the crux of where our current theories fail us-will lead to a profound, new understanding of the nature of time and space. To find answers, however, we must venture beyond Einstein. The answers require new theories, such as the inflationary Universe and new insights in high-energy particle theory. Like Einstein s theories, these make fantastic predictions that seem hard to believe: unseen dimensions and entire universes beyond our own. We must find facts to confront and guide these new theories. Powerful new technologies now make this possible. And NASA and its partners are developing an armada of space-based observatories to chart the path to discovery. Here is where the Beyond Einstein story begins.

In India, the complexity of urban development is so rapid that it demands quick response and perspective physical planning of the cities and towns. Therefore, it is necessary and fundamental for policy makers to incorporate remote sensing into urban planning and management. Remote sensing is the observation and measurement of objects from a distance, i. e. instruments or recorders are not in direct contact with objects under investigation. Remote sensing depends upon measuring <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> that is emitted, transmitted, or reflected from an object in order to determine certain physical properties of the object. One of the most common types of remote sensing is photography. Till date maps and land survey records from the 1960 ’s and 70 ’s were used for urban studies, but now the trend has shifted to using digital, multispectral images acquired by EOS and other sensors. The output of a remote sensing system is usually an image representing the scene being observed. Since remote sensing may not provide all the information needed for a full-fledged assessment, many other spatial attributes are needed to be integrated with remote sensing data. This integration of spatial data and their combined analysis is performed through GIS technique. The fashion of using remotely sensed data in urban studies began with first-generation satellite. The high resolution PAN and LISS III merged data can be used together effectively for urban applications. Remote sensing is widely in Cartographic surveys. P- 6 data is used for updating terrain visualization, generation of a national topographic database, utilities planning and other GIS applications needed for urban areas. The satellite will provide cadastral level information up to a 1 : 5, 000 scale, and will be useful for making 2 - 5 meter contour map (NRSA 2005). Remote Sensing techniques are extremely useful for selection of sites for specific facilities such as hospitals, restaurants, solid waste disposal and industry. Urban planning requires a large volume of data both at the time of planning and at the time of implementation of the plan to determine the status of the available facilities. Thus remote sensing techniques provide accurate, orderly and reliable information for planning and management of a town or a city. Remote Sensing techniques are extremely useful for change detection analysis and selection of sites for specific facilities such as hospitals, restaurants, solid waste disposal and industry...|$|R
40|$|The {{electric}} energy distribution infrastructure {{is undergoing a}} startling technological evolution {{with the development of}} the smart grid concept, which allows more interaction between the supply-and the demand-side of the network and results in a great optimization potential. In this paper, we focus on a smart grid in which the demand-side comprises traditional users as well as users owning <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> distributed <b>energy</b> source and/or energy storage device. By means of a day-ahead demand-side management mechanism regulated through an independent central unit, the latter users are interested in reducing their monetary expense by producing or storing energy rather than just purchasing their energy needs from the grid. Using a general energy pricing model, we tackle the grid optimization design from two different perspectives: a user-oriented optimization and an holistic-based design. In the former case, we optimize each user individually by formulating the grid optimization problem as a noncooperative game, whose solution analysis is addressed building on the theory of variational inequalities. In the latter case, we focus instead on the joint optimization of the whole system, allowing some cooperation among the users. For both formulations, we devise distributed and iterative algorithms providing the optimal production/storage strategies of the users, along with their convergence properties. Among all, the proposed algorithms preserve the users' privacy and require very limited signaling with the central unit. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R
