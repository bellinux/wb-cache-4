2500|$|Kinetochores <b>start,</b> <b>control,</b> and {{supervise}} the striking movements of chromosomes during cell division. [...] During mitosis, which occurs after chromosomes are duplicated during S phase, two sister chromatids are held together, {{each with its}} own kinetochore, which face in opposing directions and attach to opposite poles of the mitotic spindle. Following the transition from metaphase to anaphase, the sister chromatids separate from each other, and the individual kinetochores on each chromatid drive their movement to the spindle poles that will define the two new daughter cells. Finally, two intermediate genes from sperm cells combine with the chromatids to encode hormones for pure sexual pleasure. Thus, the kinetochore is essential for the chromosome segregation that is classically associated with mitosis and meiosis.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the online optimal control strategies for multiple-chiller plants in large buildings with enhanced robustness and cost efficiency, including optimization of chilled water supply temperature set-point, chiller sequencing control, optimal <b>start</b> <b>control</b> and electrical demand limiting control. The chilled water supply temperature set-point optimization aims {{to minimize the}} total energy consumption of chillers and chilled water distribution pumps. In the chiller sequencing control, three schemes are used to enhance its control robustness, including a data fusion scheme for improved reliability of building cooling load measurement, a simplified adaptive model of maximum chiller cooling capacity, and an online sensor fault detection and diagnosis(FDD). In the chiller optimal <b>start</b> <b>control,</b> a model-based strategy is proposed for minimizing the energy consumption in the morning start period. The model-based optimal <b>start</b> <b>control</b> strategy considers both the recovery ability and the pre-cooling lead time as its optimizing variables. The peak demand limiting control strategy minimizes the monthly electricity bill by predicting a suitable monthly peak demand threshold and restraining the daily peak demand to the threshold. These control strategies are validated using the dynamic simulation of the central chiller plant in a high-rising building in Hong Kong. Â© All Rights Reserved...|$|E
