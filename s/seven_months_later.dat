40|$|Malformation {{rates in}} the German state of Bavaria, as a whole, did not {{increase}} in 1987, the year following the Chernobyl accident. Also {{an analysis of the}} monthly data does not show any association between radiation exposure and malformation rates <b>seven</b> <b>month</b> <b>later.</b> But in a detailed analysis on the level of districts taking the spatial structure into account we find an association between malformation rates and the calculated caesium concentration in pregnant women. We used a nonparametric estimation of the dose-response relationship, which gives an increasing malformation risk for regions with higher caesium exposure. The results should be interpreted carefully, since the analysis has been conducted as an explorative observational study. The results are not in line with the present understanding of the biological effects, including the existence of a threshold dose, for teratogenic effects of low level ionising radiation.
