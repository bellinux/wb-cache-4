5|$|The {{occupiers}} looted {{and destroyed}} much of Poland's {{cultural and historical}} heritage, while persecuting and murdering members of the Polish cultural elite. Most Polish schools were closed, and those that remained open <b>saw</b> <b>their</b> curricula altered significantly.|$|E
5|$|Secondly, quotas {{were raised}} {{to limit the}} ability of workers to overfulfill targets. In the case of time workers, this was {{sometimes}} done by keeping quotas the same but reducing hours; for example, coal miners <b>saw</b> <b>their</b> working day shortened to six hours. Some rises were very steep; {{in the case of}} engineering enterprises, quotas were raised by 65 percent.|$|E
5|$|The Jägerstab {{was given}} {{extraordinary}} powers over labour, production and transportation resources, with its functions taking priority over housing repairs for bombed out civilians or restoration of vital city services. The factories that {{came under the}} Jägerstab program <b>saw</b> <b>their</b> work-weeks extended to 72 hours. At the same time, Milch took steps to rationalise production by {{reducing the number of}} variants of each type of aircraft produced.|$|E

In his A Fortunate Life, Bert Facey describes his method of building a slab house for a farmer, having watched and helped others to build such structures several times during his life.|$|R
5000|$|LaMendola's {{approach}} to saw playing {{is to use}} it primarily as a melodic instrument, rather than a simple atmospheric effect, which is demonstrated in such songs as [...] "Lynette" [...] and [...] "Jonquil". The prevalence of <b>saw</b> in <b>their</b> music was noted by the Village Voice when they wrote [...] "Cabaret weirdos Ching Chong Song have a surprisingly large amount of singing <b>saw</b> in <b>their</b> tunes." ...|$|R

While {{most of the}} children were met by their new families at London's Liverpool Street station, some of the children got off the trains at Harwich, where they were placed with local families. Few if any of the Winton children <b>saw</b> <b>their</b> parents again.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the race, Nico Rosberg {{cemented}} his position {{at the top of the}} Drivers' Championship, having taken the maximum number of 100 points available from the first four rounds. Lewis Hamilton followed in second with 57 points, while Kimi Räikkönen moved up to third with 43 points. Vettel's retirement dropped him to fifth in the standings, behind Daniel Ricciardo. In the Constructors' standings, Mercedes increased their points tally to 157, now 81 points clear of second-placed Ferrari. Red Bull's poor performance <b>saw</b> <b>their</b> advantage over fourth placed Williams reduced to just six points.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} {{following}} 1857, none of the cabinets survived long. They quickly collapsed {{due to the lack}} of a majority in the Chamber of Deputies. The Conservative Party had split down the middle: on one side were the ultraconservatives, and on the other, the moderate conservatives. In the wake of Carneiro Leão's cabinet, a new generation of politicians had emerged, eager to acquire more power inside the Conservative Party. Paranhos belonged to this younger age group. These men <b>saw</b> <b>their</b> path to the top ranks as being blocked by the Conservative elders, who would not easily relinquish control.|$|E

5|$|George {{was born}} in the city of Hanover in Germany, and was the son of George Louis, Hereditary Prince of Brunswick-Lüneburg (later King George I of Great Britain), and his wife, Sophia Dorothea of Celle. His sister, Sophia Dorothea, was born when he was three years old. Both of George's parents {{committed}} adultery, and in 1694 their marriage was dissolved on the pretext that Sophia had abandoned her husband. She was confined to Ahlden House and denied access to her two children, who probably never <b>saw</b> <b>their</b> mother again.|$|E
5|$|In {{this way}} they congregated {{a group of}} Christian Indians in the {{location}} {{of what is now}} the town of Rabinal. Las Casas became instrumental in the introduction of the New Laws in 1542, established by the Spanish Crown to control the excesses of the conquistadors and colonists against the indigenous inhabitants of the Americas. As a result, the Dominicans met substantial resistance from the Spanish colonists, who <b>saw</b> <b>their</b> own interests threatened by the New Laws; this distracted the Dominicans from their efforts to establish peaceful control over the Land of War.|$|E
5|$|Lax was {{admitted}} a Fellow of the Royal Society on 5 April 1796. He was nominated by the Astronomer Royal Nevil Maskelyne, Anthony Shepherd, Richard Farmer and William Wales. However, {{due to an}} enmity of the President Joseph Banks, friends of Charles Hutton and Maskelyne, such as Lax, Samuel Vince and Thomas Mudge, frequently <b>saw</b> <b>their</b> submissions for publications overlooked. If any of them submitted papers to the Society: they had the honour of having them carefully lodged in {{the archives of the}} Society, where the world in general, or even the members of the Society, would derive no more benefit from them than if they were deposited at the centre of the earth.|$|E
50|$|Voters {{approved}} {{the creation of}} Pinellas County Sheriff's Department in 1912. The early Pinellas County Sheriff's Office reflected the rough and rural nature of the peninsula at that time. Bootlegging, moon shining, and gambling were daily occurrences and the Sheriff's Office was kept busy running after a host of colorful criminals. Jail escapes were not uncommon. Newspapers reported how inmates <b>sawed</b> <b>their</b> way through the iron bars with tools smuggled in from the outside.|$|R

5|$|Malagasy {{hopes for}} greater {{sovereignty}} were stirred by remarks given by General Charles de Gaulle at the Brazzaville Conference in 1944, where de Gaulle announced all colonies were thereafter French overseas territories entitled to {{representation in the}} French National Assembly, and promised citizenship rights to residents of its overseas colonies. Despite the partial implementation of these reforms, forced labor on French-owned plantations and other rights abuses in Madagascar continued unabated. The nationalist secret society Panama (Patriotes nationalistes malgaches) was founded in 1941, followed in 1943 by another called Jiny after a type of local red bird. Both organizations, which sought to achieve independence by force if necessary, <b>saw</b> <b>their</b> membership swell during this period.|$|E
5|$|Many Portuguese colonials {{were not}} typical {{settlers}} in Mozambique. While most European communities in Africa {{at the time}} - {{with the possible exception}} of Afrikaners - were established from the late nineteenth to early twentieth centuries, some white families and institutions in those territories still administered by Portugal had been entrenched for generations. Loss of their privileged status and fears of FRELIMO reprisal resulted in an exodus of up to 200,000 white civilians at independence (in Europe they were popularly known as retornados). Cities, towns and villages <b>saw</b> <b>their</b> Portuguese names changed after independence - Lourenço Marques to Maputo, Vila Pery to Chimoio, Vila Cabral to Lichinga, or Vila Junqueiro to Gurúè.|$|E
5|$|On 7 November, Vale conceded {{twice in}} one game {{for the first time}} in the season, as Peel Park <b>saw</b> <b>their</b> Accrington Stanley side achieve a 2–2 draw with the Vale. Vale lost a two-goal lead in the match, as Ian Brydon scored after the ball got stuck in the mud and then Les Cocker scored the {{equalising}} goal after Ray King failed to hold on to a shot. By this time Vale were building a significant point advantage over the rest of the league. On 28 November, Ken Griffiths scored a hat-trick as Vale 'tore apart' a poor Rochdale side 6–0, exceeding the record Vale Park win that had been set only two months earlier.|$|E

5|$|Soviet Russia, {{while at}} the time {{publicly}} supporting Polish and Lithuanian independence, sponsored communist agitators working against {{the government of the}} Second Polish Republic, and considered that its eastern borders should approximate those of the defunct Congress Poland. Poles and Lithuanians, on the other hand, inspired by memories of the greatness of the erstwhile Grand Duchy of Lithuania, part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, <b>saw</b> <b>their</b> borders as lying much farther east. The leader of the Polish forces, Józef Piłsudski, discerned an opportunity for regaining territories that were once the part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and since then were part of the Prussian Empire, shaken by the 1917 Revolution and the ongoing Russian Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Taraki's Government {{initiated}} a land reform on 1 January 1979 which attempted {{to limit the}} amount of land a family could own. Those whose landholdings exceeded the limit <b>saw</b> <b>their</b> property requisitioned by the government without compensation. The Afghan leadership believed the reform would meet with popular approval among the rural population while weakening the power of the bourgeoisie. The reform was declared complete in mid-1979 and the government proclaimed that 665,000 hectares (approximately 1,632,500 acres) had been redistributed. The government also declared that only 40,000 families, or 4 percent of the population, had been negatively affected by the land reform.|$|E
5|$|The Hitmen entered {{their first}} season {{playing in the}} newly formed Central Division, and were {{predicted}} to finish as high as third in the five-team division. Instead, they finished as the second-worst regular season team in the league, posting an 18–51–3 record. The Hitmen lost CAD$250,000 in their first season and <b>saw</b> <b>their</b> season ticket base halved to 700 for the 1996–97 season. The losses led to questions about {{the viability of the}} club.|$|E
50|$|After {{a lengthy}} search, and after many imposters who {{deliberately}} <b>sawed</b> <b>their</b> legs off, the Coroner {{arrives at the}} Goodies place. Grahame is about to reveal {{the owner of the}} leg in Tim's favour when Bill bursts in dressed as a one-legged pirate who claims the leg is his. After a pathetic attempt to get the leg on him (and his Parrot), Bill grudgingly calls in Tim to try the leg on. To Bill's amazement, as he had no knowledge Tim's leg was missing, it fits.|$|R

5|$|The Swedes {{were not}} {{popular in the}} regions that Sweden had gained at the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658. With the new war going badly, insurgents <b>saw</b> <b>their</b> chance to rise up against the unpopular rule. Swedish response, {{especially}} in Scania, was more subtle than one might believe. An all out terror campaign would have been economically disastrous. Instead small patrols searching the woods were often employed combined with promises of carrots or sticks to the local farmers.|$|E
5|$|The eastern {{market for}} {{ice in the}} U.S. was also changing. Cities like New York, Baltimore and Philadelphia <b>saw</b> <b>their</b> {{population}} boom {{in the second half}} of the century; New York tripled in size between 1850 and 1890, for example. This drove up the demand for ice considerably across the region. By 1879, householders in the eastern cities were consuming two thirds of a ton (601kg) of ice a year, being charged 40 cents ($9.30) per 100 pounds (45kg); 1,500 wagons were needed just to deliver ice to consumers in New York.|$|E
5|$|The first metal cannon was the pot-de-fer. Loaded with an arrow-like bolt {{that was}} {{probably}} wrapped in leather to allow greater thrusting power, it was set off through a touch hole with a heated wire. This weapon, and others similar, were used by both the French and English, during the Hundred Years' War, when cannon <b>saw</b> <b>their</b> first real use on the European battlefield. Even then, cannon were still a relatively rare weapon.|$|E
