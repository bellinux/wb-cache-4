40|$|Proximal caries or coronal {{defect in}} {{posterior}} teeth {{may result in}} the loss of proximal space and drifting of neighboring teeth, which makes restoration difficult. Inability to restore proper contours and to align tooth axis properly are commonly encountered problems when planning tooth restoration. Moreover, tilted teeth aggravate periodontal tissue breakdown, such as pseudo-pocket, and angular osseous defect. The purpose of this case presentation is to describe a simple technique for inducing minor tooth movement with orthodontic <b>separating</b> <b>ring</b> and provisional restoration modification. This method was used to create crown placement space on mesially tilted molar. This method is easy, simple and efficient technique which could be used in interproximal space gaining in selected situation...|$|E

The aim of the proposed research work {{was to develop a}} novel dual-compartment capsule (NDCC) with polymeric disc for gastroretentive dosage form, which will ultimately result in better solubility and bioavailability of Ofloxacin. Floating ring caps were formulated by using different natural polymers, <b>separating</b> <b>ring</b> band and swellable polymer located at the bottom of capsule. Formulated ring caps were assessed for coating thickness, In vitro buoyancy, In vitro drug release, release kinetics and stability studies. Coating attained by the capsule shell was found to be 0. 0643 mm. Depending on nature of natural polymer used, most of the formulations showed buoyancy for more than 9 hrs. Developed formulation demonstrated considerably higher drug release up to 9 hrs. The developed formulation FE 2 depicted the drug release according to Korsmeyer-Peppas model. There was not any significant change in performance characteristics of developed ring caps after subjecting them to stability studies. The present study suggests that the use of NDCC for oral delivery of Ofloxacin could be an alternative to improve its systemic availability which could be regulated by the floating approach. The designed dosage system can have futuristic applications over payloads which require stomach-specific delivery. 1...|$|E

40|$|DNA {{cleavage}} by Type III restriction enzymes {{is governed}} strictly by the relative arrangement of recognition sites on a DNA substrate—endonuclease activity is usually only triggered by sequences in head-to-head orientation. Tens {{to thousands of}} base pairs can separate these sites. Long distance communication over such distances could occur by either one-dimensional (1 D) DNA translocation or 3 D DNA looping. To distinguish between these alternatives, we analysed the activity of EcoPI and EcoP 15 I on DNA catenanes in which the recognition sites were either on the same or <b>separate</b> <b>rings.</b> While substrates {{with a pair of}} sites located on the same ring were cleaved efficiently, catenanes with sites on <b>separate</b> <b>rings</b> were not cleaved. These results exclude a simple 3 D DNA-looping activity. To characterize the interactions further, EcoPI was incubated with plasmids carrying two recognition sites interspersed with two 21 res sites for site-specific recombination by Tn 21 resolvase; inhibition of recombination would indicate the formation of stable DNA loops. No inhibition was observed, even under conditions where EcoPI translocation could also occur...|$|R
