5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Atlanta, Georgia's capital city, {{underwent}} significant economic and <b>social</b> <b>change.</b> To serve a growing economy based on manufacturing and commerce, many people left {{the countryside to}} relocate in Atlanta, often in primitive housing. Employment conditions in the city included child labor, a 66-hour work week, low wages, and unregulated and unsafe work sites. Men from the traditional and paternalistic rural society felt it degrading that their womenfolk were forced into the city to work in factories. Mixed gender workplaces were seen as places for potential corruption.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1894, Du Bois {{received}} several job offers, including one from the prestigious Tuskegee Institute; he accepted a teaching job at Wilberforce University in Ohio.Lewis, p. 111. At Wilberforce, Du Bois was strongly influenced by Alexander Crummell, who believed that ideas and morals are necessary tools to effect <b>social</b> <b>change.</b> While at Wilberforce, Du Bois married Nina Gomer, one of his students, on May 12, 1896.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the roles of personal and <b>social</b> <b>changes</b> {{on the relationship between}} injury severity and life satisfaction among individuals with acquired brain injury (ABI). Personal change (i. e. having developed a survivor identity, identity strength), <b>social</b> <b>changes</b> (i. e. improved social relationships, support from services), injury severity (i. e. length of time in coma) and well-being (i. e. life satisfaction) were assessed in a sample of 630 individuals with ABIs. A counterintuitive positive relationship was found between injury severity and life satisfaction. Bootstrapping analyses indicated that this relationship was mediated by personal and <b>social</b> <b>changes.</b> Although identity strength was the strongest individual mediator, both personal and <b>social</b> <b>changes</b> each explained unique variance in this relationship. These findings suggest that strategies that strengthen personal identity and social relationships may be beneficial for individuals recovering from ABIs...|$|R
40|$|Many of the <b>social</b> <b>changes</b> of the 20 th {{century have}} had a {{significant}} impact on the traditional roles of grandparenting. These <b>social</b> <b>changes</b> include the feminist movement of the seventies, advances in medical and communication technologies, changes to the traditional family structure, modern divorce laws, the increase in drug and alcohol abuse, as well as an increase in child abuse and neglect. This paper arises out of a study that explored the impact these key <b>social</b> <b>changes</b> have had on the grandparent role of contemporary Australian grandparents. The paper discusses findings from interviews conducted with grandparents who reside in northern New South Wales. The findings have relevance to development of policies relating to childcare, grandparents raising grandchildren and divorce law reform. Conclusions are drawn about further research needed into the impact of <b>social</b> <b>changes</b> on the grandparent role of contemporary Australian grandparents...|$|R

5|$|Innis's {{theories}} of political economy, media and society remain highly relevant: {{he had a}} profound influence on critical media theory and communications and, in conjunction with McLuhan, offered groundbreaking Canadian perspectives on the function of communication technologies as key agents in social and historical change. Together, their works advanced a theory of history in which communication is central to <b>social</b> <b>change</b> and transformation.|$|E
5|$|Conscription was {{introduced}} in Canada during {{the final years of}} the war, which was accompanied by labour shortages, pressures for <b>social</b> <b>change,</b> and the rapid unionisation of the remaining workforce. While concerns about the Central Powers declined, fears grew in government at the end of 1918 that the new Bolshevik government in Russia might be covertly orchestrating a campaign of strikes across Canada. In response the Prime Minister, Robert Borden, created a Public Safety Branch led by the politician Charles Cahan. Cahan envisaged transforming this organisation into a much larger secret service, similar to the Bureau of Investigation in the United States, but he soon fell out with Borden and ultimately resigned.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary {{political}} sociology includes these areas of research, {{but it has}} been opened up to wider questions of power and politics. Today political sociologists are as likely to be concerned with how identities are formed that contribute to structural domination by one group over another; the politics of who knows how and with what authority; and questions of how power is contested in social interactions {{in such a way as}} to bring about widespread cultural and <b>social</b> <b>change.</b> Such questions are more likely to be studied qualitatively. The study of social movements and their effects has been especially important in relation to these wider definitions of politics and power.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{proclamation}} of independence, neither the Belgian nor the Congolese government intended the colonial social order to end immediately. The Belgian government hoped that whites might keep their position indefinitely. The Republic of the Congo was still reliant on colonial {{institutions like the}} Force Publique to function from day to day, and white technical experts, installed by the Belgians, were retained in the broad absence of suitably qualified black Congolese replacements (partly the result of colonial restrictions regarding higher education). Many Congolese people had assumed that independence would produce tangible and immediate <b>social</b> <b>change,</b> so the retention of whites in positions of importance was widely resented.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, Paris was {{the home}} and subject for some of France's {{greatest}} writers, including Charles Baudelaire, Stéphane Mallarmé, Mérimée, Alfred de Musset, Marcel Proust, Émile Zola, Alexandre Dumas, Gustave Flaubert, Guy de Maupassant and Honoré de Balzac. Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre Dame inspired the renovation of its setting, the Notre-Dame de Paris. Another of Victor Hugo's works, Les Misérables, written {{while he was in}} exile outside France during the Second Empire, described the <b>social</b> <b>change</b> and political turmoil in Paris in the early 1830s. One of the most popular of all French writers, Jules Verne, worked at the Theatre Lyrique and the Paris stock exchange, while he did research for his stories at the National Library.|$|E
5|$|Estate house design {{declined}} in {{importance in the}} twentieth century. An exception was the work undertaken by John Kinross (1855–1955). Beginning with the reconstruction of Thurston House, Dunbar, from 1890, he undertook a series of major country house designs. The most important was Manderston House (1901–03), built for James Miller in the Adam style. Skibo Castle was rebuilt for industrialist Andrew Carnegie (1899–1903) by Ross and Macbeth. English architect C. H. B. Quennell designed a neo-Georgian mansion at Altmore (1912–14) for {{the owner of a}} Moscow department store. There was a lull in building after the First World War and <b>social</b> <b>change</b> undermined the construction of rural country houses.|$|E

5|$|Grameen Bank is {{best known}} for its system of {{solidarity}} lending. The Bank also incorporates a set of values embodied in Bangladesh by the Sixteen Decisions. At every branch of Grameen Bank, the borrowers recite these Decisions and vow to follow them. As a result of the Sixteen Decisions, Grameen borrowers have been encouraged to adopt positive social habits. One such habit includes educating children by sending them to school. Since the Grameen Bank embraced the Sixteen Decisions, almost all Grameen borrowers have their school-age children enrolled in regular classes. This in turn helps bring about <b>social</b> <b>change,</b> and educate the next generation.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1920s, the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) {{reached its}} peak {{membership}} in the South and Midwest after a revival beginning around 1915. Its growth was {{due in part to}} tensions from rapid industrialization and <b>social</b> <b>change</b> in many growing cities; in the Midwest and West, its growth was related to the competition of waves of new immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe. The KKK was strong in the Florida cities of Jacksonville and Tampa; Miami's chapter was influential enough to hold initiations at the Miami Country Club. The Klan also flourished in smaller towns of the South where racial violence had a long tradition dating back to the Reconstruction era. An editor of The Gainesville Daily Sun admitted that {{he was a member of}} the Klan in 1922, and praised the organization in print.|$|E
5|$|Marx's {{thoughts}} on labour {{were related to}} the primacy he gave to the economic relation in determining the society's past, present and future (see also economic determinism). Accumulation of capital shapes the social system. For Marx, <b>social</b> <b>change</b> was about conflict between opposing interests, driven in the background by economic forces. This became the inspiration for the body of works known as the conflict theory. In his evolutionary model of history, he argued that human history began with free, productive and creative work that was over time coerced and dehumanised, a trend most apparent under capitalism. Marx noted that this was not an intentional process, rather no individual or even state can go against the forces of economy.|$|E

5|$|Other Marxists, such as George Derwent Thomson and Neil Faulkner, {{have argued}} that Childe's archaeological work should not {{correctly}} be considered Marxist because he failed {{to take into account}} the existence of class struggle as an instrument of <b>social</b> <b>change,</b> something which was a core tenet of Marxist thought. While class struggle was not a factor he considered in his archaeological work, Childe did accept that historians and archaeologists typically interpreted the past through their own class interests, and that most of his contemporaries were producing studies with an innate bourgeois agenda. Childe also diverged from orthodox Marxism by not employing dialectics in his methodology. Furthermore, he denied Marxism's ability to predict the future development of human society, and did not consider humanity's development into pure communism to be inevitable, instead opining that society could fossilize or become extinct instead.|$|E
5|$|Over time, {{emphasis}} {{in studies of}} leisure has shifted from the work-leisure relation, particularly in well-researched majorities, to study of minorities and the relation between leisure and culture. Marshall Gordon noted {{that there are two}} approaches in the study of leisure: formal and historical-theoretical. The formal approach focuses on empirical questions, such as the shifting of leisure patterns over an individual's life cycle, the relation between leisure and work, and specific forms of leisure (such as the sociology of sport). The historical-theoretical approach studies the relation between leisure and <b>social</b> <b>change,</b> often from structural-functionalist and neo-Marxist perspectives. Sheila Scraton provided a different analysis, comparing North American and British studies. The British approaches focus on input from pluralism, critical Marxism, and feminism; the American approaches concentrate on the social-psychological tradition.|$|E
5|$|Postwar {{social unrest}} was {{also related to}} the {{difficulties}} of absorbing the veterans {{from the war in}} the job market. Competition among groups for work heightened tensions. In the 1920s there was growing anti-Semitism in the United States related to economic competition and the fears of <b>social</b> <b>change</b> from decades of changed immigration, a lingering anti-German sentiment left over from World War I, and anti-black violence erupted in numerous locations as well. In this period African Americans were leaving the South by the tens of thousands, to escape oppressive social conditions and find work in the North and Midwestern industrial cities, in what came to be called the Great Migration.|$|E
