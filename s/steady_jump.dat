In this work a youth population of an age group between 13 - 14 years old will be treated. The total number of participants is defined to an amount of 100 of young basketball players, members of two different basketball academies. In this experiment, the subjects will conduct tests in 5 basic motor skills variables such as: 1. <b>Steady</b> <b>Jump</b> in length, 2 <b>steady</b> <b>jump</b> in height 3. 20 meters run from a steady start, 4. Medicine Ball Throw and 5. Agility Test. While from specific motor movement skills are included: 1. 20 Meters run with ball, 2. Basketball shooting for 30 seconds round-trip, 3. Anaerobic durability with and without ball (kamikaze) 4. Intensive Basketball shots-Change of direction and 5. Basketball shots from five positions. Subject to the number of subjects that will be treated in this study, their age and the amount of variables tested, the main objectives of this study, will be limited to achieving the goals. On the basis of test results, it can be concluded that there are no significant differences in the basic motor parameters between the two groups G 1 and G 2, mostly due to systematic practice effects rather than academy belonging itself. In the other hand, {{differences between the two groups}} in the specific basketball motor skills can be clearly identified, in typical basketball movement situations. In addition, comparing the test results of the individuals tested for the purpose if this diagnosis, a much more advanced level of motor skills compared to the normal population of the same group age that don’t engage in basketball activities can be identified. This experimental study carried out in the youth in the age group of 13 (-+ 6 months) years old that continuously in a systematic manner attend basketball academies in two different basketball schools, with sustainable arguments can show the importance of systematic valuation in order to solve many arising problems such as: planning, programming, developing and controlling the effects of training work.

40|$|We {{solve the}} two-dimensional, planar Navier-Stokes {{equations}} to simulate a laminar, standing hydraulic jump using a Volume-of-Fluid method. The geometry downstream of the jump {{has been designed}} to be similar to experimental conditions by including a pit {{at the edge of the}} platform over which liquid film flows. We obtain jumps with and without separation. Increasing the inlet Froude number pushes the jump downstream and makes the slope of the jump weaker, consistent with experimental observations of circular jumps, and decreasing the Reynolds number brings the jump upstream while making it steeper. We study the effect of the length of the domain and that of a downstream obstacle on the structure and location of the jump. The transient flow which leads to a final <b>steady</b> <b>jump</b> is described for the first time to our knowledge. In the moderate Reynolds number regime, we obtain steady undular jumps with a separated bubble underneath the first few undulations. Interestingly, surface tension leads to shortening of wavelength of these undulations. We show that the undulations can be explained using the inviscid theory of Benjamin and Lighthill (Proc. R. Soc.

For compound notches of rectangular and triangle, a turbulence in flow increases as the angle of lower notch decreases.

Using a proper mechanical scheme, an analytical solution is obtained for the free surface profile of the flow. This solution allows {{the determination of the}} sequent depths and their positions. Thus, the length of the jump, which is assumed to be equal to the length of the roller, is also found. The mainstream and roller thicknesses can also be derived.

40|$|Air vent {{systems are}} {{designed}} to protect hydropower penstocks and reservoir outlets under various operating conditions. During an emergency closure of an upstream gate the hydraulic jump that forms downstream of the gate is not stationary and may advance downstream potentially increasing the total air demand. A lab-scale physical model of a general outlet works piping configuration was constructed at Reclamation’s Hydraulics Laboratory in Denver, CO to observe hydraulic jump behavior during emergency gate closures. Parameters including gate discharge, gate closure rate, air vent size, and downstream pipe pressure were tested at two different pipe slopes. Results indicate that the hydraulic jump travel speed is dependent on air vent size as well as gate closure rate, both of which affect the internal pressure in the pipe near the vent connection. For a shallow-sloped pipe, the jump speed remains steady throughout the entire pipe length if the air supply is sufficient. However, if air flow is significantly reduced due to an undersized air vent, unsteady travel speeds and pressure surges were observed. This {{was not the case}} for a steep-sloped pipe which produced <b>steady</b> <b>jump</b> speeds for all vent sizes. Once completed, these results are expected to be applicable for prediction of hydraulic jump travel speed and its effects on air demand for vent sizing considerations based on hydraulic operating conditions...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{integral}} conservation of linear and angular {{momentum in the}} <b>steady</b> hydraulic <b>jump</b> in a linearly converging channel, following the recent research line of the authors concerning the same phenomenon in a linearly diverging channel. The flow is considered divided into a mainstream, that conveys the total liquid discharge, and a roller, where no average mass transport occurs. No macroscopic rheological relationship is assumed, so mass, momentum and angular momentum integral balances are independent relationships. Normal stresses are assumed hydrostatically distributed on each vertical and viscous stresses are assumed negligible with respect to turbulent stresses. Horizontal velocity is considered uniform in the mainstream and horizontal momentum and angular momentum in the roller are neglected {{with respect to their}} mainstream counterparts. Using such simplified assumptions an analytical solution is obtained for the free surface profile of the flow, which is fundamental for finding the sequent depths and their positions. Such solution permits to compute the jump length, which is assumed equal to the roller length. Mainstream and roller thicknesses can also be derived. The model may also be used to theoretically derive the average shear stresses exerted by the roller on the mainstream and the power losses per unit weight. This final relationship, which returns the well-known classical expression for total power loss in the jump, demonstrates {{the internal consistency of the}} mechanical model...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the integral conservation of linear and angular {{momentum in the}} <b>steady</b> hydraulic <b>jump</b> in a linearly diverging channel. The flow {{is considered to be}} divided into a mainstream that conveys the total liquid discharge, and a roller where no average mass transport occurs. It is assumed that no macroscopic rheological relationship holds, so mass, momentum and angular momentum integral balances are independent relationships. Normal stresses are assumed to be hydrostatic on vertical, cylindrical surfaces. Viscous stresses are assumed to be negligible with respect to turbulent stresses. Assuming that the horizontal velocity distribution in the mainstream is uniform and that the horizontal momentum and angular momentum in the roller are negligible with respect to their mainstream counterparts, an analytical solution is obtained for the free surface profile of the flow. This solution is fundamental for finding the sequent depths and their positions. Consequently, it permits solving for the length of the jump, which is assumed to be equal to the length of the roller. Mainstream and roller thicknesses can also be derived from the present solution. This model may also be theoretically used to derive the average shear stresses exerted by the roller on the mainstream and the power losses per unit weight.

Bore-vortex interactions are studied analytically and numerically to validate the model; these include bores as "breaking waves'' in a channel and a bore traveling over a conical and Gaussian hump. In these complex numerical test cases, we correctly predict the generation of potential vorticity by non-uniform bores.

40|$|Debris flows, {{avalanches}} {{and other}} geophysical mass flows pose a significant hazard to settlements {{in or near}} mountainous regions. Understanding the physical processes that govern these flows {{is an essential part}} of hazard assessment and mitigation strategies. This thesis addresses two aspects of geophysical mass flows: flow self-channelisation due to the formation of lateral levees, and granular shocks, which occur when a rapidly-moving debris flow or avalanche collides with an obstacle. We present the results of large-scale debris flow experiments in which the flow is channelised by coarse-particle levees that form at the flow margins. The flow surface velocities are measured with high speed overhead photography, and the deposits both sampled to obtain the grain size distribution and excavated to recover the deposited locations of tracer pebbles that were introduced in to the flow. We propose a model, supported by evidence from the large-scale experiments, that describes in detail the size segregation and kinematic transport processes responsible for the deposition of lateral levees. The second problem addressed in the thesis concerns granular shocks, or jumps, which are rapid changes in the depth and velocity of granular avalanches. We investigate these through experiments in which a falling jet of granular material impacts on an inclined plane, generating a <b>steady</b> granular <b>jump,</b> which is either teardrop-shaped or 'blunted'. Numerical solutions of a depth-averaged flow model agree quantitatively with many of the observed flow features. We use this model show that the transition between the teardrop-shaped and blunted jump regimes corresponds to a transition between two shock reflection structures, known as a regular and a Mach shock reflection. On planes inclined at a shallow angle, we demonstrate a wide variety of unsteady and channelised flows, which occur due to the complex interaction between flowing and stationary regions of granular material.

40|$|The {{fluorescence}} emission intensity from a conserved tryptophan residue (W 501) {{located in}} the relay loop (F 466 to L 516) of the Dicytostelium discoideum myosin II motor domain is sensitive to ATP binding and hydrolysis. The initial binding process {{is accompanied by a}} small quench in fluorescence, and this is followed by a large enhancement that appears coincident with the hydrolysis step. Using temperature and pressure jump methods, we show that the enhancement process is kinetically distinct from but coupled to the hydrolysis step. The fluorescence enhancement corresponds to the open-closed transition (k(obs) approximately 1000 s(- 1) at 20 degrees C). From the overall steady-state fluorescence signal and {{the presence or absence of}} a relaxation transient, we conclude that the ADP state is largely in the open state, while the ADP.

Therefore {{the purpose of this}} study was to determine the steady state metabolic cost of repetitive jumping on the Digi-Jump machine, and to determine if exercise on this device is more or less strenuous than similar exercise with a jump rope. We also evaluated relative intensity of this type of exercise, based on each person’s VO 2 max as measured on a treadmill. Twenty – seven subjects completed two trials, one jumping trial at a rate of 120 jumps per minute (JPM) with the jumping height set at. 5 inch for 5 min, and one graded exercise test (GXT) using the Bruce protocol. Oxygen uptake (VO 2), heart rate (HR), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), and rating perceived exertion (RPE) were measured each minute during each trial. Results of this study indicated that steady state VO 2 during the 5 min jump test was reached at the 3 rd min (p 3 ̆c. 05), therefore we equated all other variables (HR, RE, RPE) steady state to be from 3 rd min.

40|$|A {{positive}} surge {{results from}} a sudden change in flow that increases the depth. It is the unsteady flow analogy of the stationary hydraulic jump and a geophysical application is the tidal bore. The inception and development of a positive surge are commonly predicted using the method of characteristics and the Saint-Venant equations. Herein new experimental investigations were conducted in a large rectangular channel (12 m long, 0. 5 m wide) and detailed unsteady velocity measurements were performed with a high temporal and spatial resolution (200 Hz, sampling volume: 6 x 6 x 1. 5 mm 3). The experiments encompassed undular (non-breaking) and breaking bores in a horizontal slope with both smooth and rough invert conditions. A further series of experiments was conducted with a decelerating bore progressing upstream against an adverse steep slope. The undular (non-breaking) bore was observed for surge Froude number Fr less than 1. 5. For Fr 1. 5, a breaking bore was observed with a marked roller. Detailed instantaneous velocity measurements showed a marked effect of the surge front passage. The turbulent Reynolds stresses were deduced from high-pass filtered data using the technique of KOCH and CHANSON (2005). The results highlighted large normal and tangential stresses beneath the surge front. A comparison between undular (non-breaking) and breaking surge data suggested some basic differences. In a weak surge, some transient flow recirculation was recorded next to the bed. In an undular (non-breaking) bore, large velocity fluctuations and Reynolds stresses were recorded beneath the first wave crest and the secondary waves, implying a long-lasting effect after the bore front passage. A systematic comparison was conducted to {{study the effects of}} bed roughness. The boundary friction contributed to some wave attenuation and dispersion, and the free-surface data showed some agreement with the wave dispersion theory for gravity waves. The instantaneous velocity data indicated a marked effect of the rough screens on the turbulent velocity field. Large turbulent velocity fluctuations were observed. In an undular bore, the time-variations of the longitudinal velocity exhibited a lesser oscillating pattern than on a smooth bed especially close to the bed (z/do < 0. 2). In a breaking surge, a relatively longer transient recirculation was observed next to the invert. In a decelerating surge, the turbulent velocity field presented flow properties that were closer to those of a stationary hydraulic jump than of a fully-developed bore. Yet there were subtle differences between decelerating surges and <b>steady</b> hydraulic <b>jumps.</b> The turbulent stress data demonstrated intense turbulent mixing beneath the bore front and in the ensuing flow including beneath the secondary waves and whelps. The experimental findings were consistent with field observations and anecdotic evidences. These showed in particular the significant impact of small tidal bores and of non-breaking undular surges. Positive surges and tidal bores do have indeed some significant effect on natural and eco-systems.
