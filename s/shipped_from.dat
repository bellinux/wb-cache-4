50|$|In July 1627 two pirate <b>ships</b> <b>from</b> Algiers sailed {{as far as}} Iceland, raiding and {{capturing}} slaves. Two {{weeks earlier}} another pirate <b>ship</b> <b>from</b> Salé in Morocco had also raided in Iceland. Some of the slaves brought to Algiers were later ransomed back to Iceland, but some chose to stay in Algeria. In 1629 pirate <b>ships</b> <b>from</b> Algeria raided the Faroe Islands.|$|R
5000|$|Although four {{ships were}} required, {{initially}} only two, [...] and [...] were laid down. The Admiralty, following a commitment made to Parliament by the First Lord of the Admiralty, put {{the other two}} ships out to tender. Submissions of various designs were received: a broadside and turret <b>ship</b> <b>from</b> Mare & Company, a broadside <b>ship</b> <b>from</b> Palmers, a different broadside <b>ship</b> <b>from</b> Thames Ironworks, and turret <b>ships</b> <b>from</b> Napiers, Samudas and Lairds Co & Sons. All were determined to be in some way inadequate, and ultimately {{the third and fourth}} ships were built, with some delay, to the Admiralty design.|$|R
5|$|Guinness Flavour Extract, a dehydrated, {{hopped wort}} extract made from barley malt and roasted barley, {{is used for}} {{overseas}} production of the stout. The syrup is <b>shipped</b> <b>from</b> Ireland, where it is added at the ratio of 1:49 to locally brewed pale beer. In most overseas markets, Guinness Flavour Extract (GFE) is blended with locally brewed beer to produce FES.|$|E
5|$|In 1840, {{about six}} camels were <b>shipped</b> <b>from</b> Tenerife to Adelaide, {{but only one}} survived the journey to arrive on 12 October that year. The animal, a male called Harry, was owned by the {{explorer}} John Ainsworth Horrocks. Harry was ill-tempered but was included in an expedition the following year because he could carry heavy loads. The next major group of camels were imported into Australia in 1860, and between 1860 and 1907 10 to 12 thousand were imported. These were used mainly for riding and transport.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 16th century {{production}} shifted from south Wales to mid and north Wales. The Shrewsbury Drapers Company in England took a dominant role in distributing Welsh cloth. From the 18th century there was strong demand for cheap, sturdy Welsh material <b>shipped</b> <b>from</b> Bristol, Liverpool or the Welsh ports to clothe {{slaves in the}} British colonies of North America and the West Indies.|$|E
5000|$|... was a Redbreast-class {{first class}} gunboat {{launched}} in 1889. She {{was transferred to}} the Coastguard in 1906, used as a cable <b>ship</b> <b>from</b> 1915, a salvage <b>ship</b> <b>from</b> 1916 and was wrecked in 1917.|$|R
25|$|Five <b>ships</b> sailed <b>from</b> Saint John as convoy BX 28F on 8 July, {{followed}} by 48 <b>ships</b> <b>from</b> Boston on 9 July as BX 28, 8 <b>ships</b> <b>from</b> Boston on 10 July as BX 28B, and 3 <b>ships</b> <b>from</b> Boston on 11 July as BX 28C. This four-section pattern of one Bay of Fundy section and three Boston sections continued until the BX convoy series was temporarily suspended on 11 September 1942 by shifting assembly of HX convoys from Halifax to New York City.|$|R

5|$|Stern {{has also}} written that the {{disruption}} to the convoys off Norway caused by Operation Leader would have caused even greater damage to the German war effort than the shipping losses. This {{is in line with}} a wartime assessment by the British Ministry of Economic Warfare, which estimated that the raid was the main factor responsible for a 58 percent decrease in the amount of iron ore <b>shipped</b> <b>from</b> the important northern Norwegian port of Narvik during October 1943.|$|E
5|$|The 5th (West Africa) Brigade was {{the second}} of the 81st Division's brigades to be <b>shipped</b> <b>from</b> West Africa. The brigade {{comprised}} 12,000 personnel and was scheduled to depart with Convoy WS32 on 31 July. The liners Britannic, Largs Bay and Tamaroa were available in Freetown to carry 8,528 of these men, and it was decided to sail the troopship SS California directly from the Clyde to provide the remaining berths.|$|E
5|$|The panels were {{included}} in the Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings, which included another important van Eyck work, the 1434–1436 Annunciation. They were purchased by Charles Henschel of New York art dealer M. Knoedler & Company for $185,000, significantly less than the asking price of $600,000 when the works were offered in 1931. The panels were <b>shipped</b> <b>from</b> Saint Petersburg to the Matthiesen Gallery in Berlin before M. Knoedler & Company sold them on to the Metropolitan in New York that year.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ships</b> <b>from</b> England {{would go}} to Africa {{carrying}} iron products, cloth, trinkets and beads, guns and ammunition. The ships traded these goods for slaves, gold and spices (pepper). <b>Ships</b> <b>from</b> Africa {{would go to}} the American Colonies via the route known as the 'Middle Passage'. The slaves were exchanged for goods from the Americas, destined for the slave plantations. <b>Ships</b> <b>from</b> the Americas would then take raw materials back to England. The British would use the raw materials to make 'finished goods'.|$|R

50|$|In 1695 he {{captured}} the English warship Espérance (72) and later that year, two merchant <b>ships</b> <b>from</b> the East India Company. In 1696 {{he captured}} his greatest prize : 2 English merchant <b>ships</b> coming <b>from</b> India, which a cargo that was sold for 3,150,000 pounds. Later that year he also captured a merchant fleet of 9 <b>ships</b> <b>from</b> Ostende. In 1697 he operated in North America.|$|R
5|$|The {{river is}} known to have been used for {{shipping}} in Roman times, when it was navigable to Bodiam and possibly further upstream. There are records of small boats reaching Etchingham during Saxon and Norman periods. Stone for building Bodiam Castle was transported along the river in the fourteenth century, and iron was <b>shipped</b> <b>from</b> Newenden or Udiam in the sixteenth century. A century later, an iron store was erected at Udiam. Maytham Wharf served Rolvenden, while Tenterden was served by Small Hythe.|$|E
5|$|Again the defences were {{strengthened}} in September, {{in advance}} of a second siege which began on 16 October. By this stage only ten per cent of Edinburgh's inhabitants remained in the city. The besiegers under Regent Mar had only seven guns, and while they did manage to breach the Flodden Wall, the inner defences were too strong for an assault. By 21 October the siege was once again lifted. A blockade of the town was continued until July 1572 when a truce was agreed. Grange retreated into the castle and handed over the town to the Regent's party. The siege of Edinburgh Castle continued until May 1573, when it was finally reduced by a battery of guns <b>shipped</b> <b>from</b> England.|$|E
5|$|As {{an interim}} measure, 18 Royal Air Force Jaguars were loaned to the Indian Air Force, {{with the first}} two loaned {{aircraft}} operational with Western Air Command on 27July1979. The second batch of aircraft for the Indian Air Force were 40 Jaguar Internationals built at Warton, the first aircraft being delivered in March 1981. Batch Three was the assembly of another 45 aircraft by HAL of kits <b>shipped</b> <b>from</b> the United Kingdom, the first kit being shipped to India in May 1981. In the following phases more aircraft would be built in India with less European content.|$|E
50|$|Convoy SC-104 was the 104th of the {{numbered}} {{series of}} World War II Slow Convoys of merchant <b>ships</b> <b>from</b> Sydney, Cape Breton Island to Liverpool. During October 1942, a U-boat wolf pack sank eight <b>ships</b> <b>from</b> the convoy. The convoy escorts sank {{two of the}} attacking submarines.|$|R
50|$|The Hellenic Navy {{used the}} Jason class ships to replace older American landing <b>ships</b> <b>from</b> the Second World War era. The Hellenic Navy {{preferred}} to not buy new <b>ships</b> <b>from</b> {{other nations in}} order to acquire experience {{in the design and}} construction of warships entirely in Greece.|$|R
50|$|To protect Swedish <b>shipping</b> <b>from</b> pirates and to {{harm the}} enemy, the {{government}} of Charles XII of Sweden began a maritime campaign, and in June 1710 gave Lars Gathe from Onsala permission {{to act as a}} privateer and attack <b>ships</b> <b>from</b> enemy-nations such as Denmark and Russia.|$|R
5|$|At this distance, {{the land}} {{would be far}} beyond the maximum {{anticipated}} size of the city's growth, greatly reducing any potential hazards. The London and South Western Railway(LSWR)– which had connected London to Woking in 1838– would enable bodies and mourners to be <b>shipped</b> <b>from</b> London to the site easily and cheaply. Although the Brookwood site was a long distance from London, Broun and Sprye argued that {{the speed of the}} railway made it both quicker and cheaper to reach than the seven existing cemeteries, all of which required a slow and expensive horse-drawn hearse to carry the body and mourners from London to the burial site.|$|E
5|$|Danish workers {{involved}} in the clean-up operation claimed long-term health problems resulted from their exposure to the radiation. Although they did not work at Camp Hunziker, the Danes worked at the Tank Farm where the contaminated ice was collected, in the port where the contaminated debris was <b>shipped</b> <b>from,</b> and they also serviced the vehicles used in the clean-up. It {{is also possible that}} they were exposed to radiation in the local atmosphere. Many of the workers surveyed in the years following Project Crested Ice reported health problems. A 1995 survey found 410 deaths by cancers out of a sample of 1,500 workers.|$|E
5|$|Dromedaries {{were also}} <b>shipped</b> <b>from</b> {{south-western}} Asia to Spain, Italy, Turkey, France, Canary Islands, the Americas and Australia. Dromedaries were introduced into Spain in 1020 AD and to Sicily in 1059 AD. Camels were exported to the Canary Islands in 1405 during the European colonisation of the area, {{and are still}} extant there, especially in Lanzarote and {{to the south of}} Fuerteventura. Attempts to introduce dromedaries into the Caribbean, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia and Brazil were made between the 17th and 19th centuries; some were imported to the western United States in the 1850s and some to Namibia in the early 1900s, but presently they exist in small numbers or are absent in these areas.|$|E

5|$|During mid-1944 the Imperial Japanese Army's General Staff {{decided to}} {{reinforce}} the garrisons of the southern Philippines and Borneo ahead of an expected Allied offensive to liberate these areas. As part of this effort, the 54th, 55th, 56th, 57th and 58th Independent Mixed Brigades were ordered to be formed for service with the Southern Expeditionary Army Group during June. Aside from the 58th Independent Mixed Brigade, which was formed by converting an existing unit, these new brigades were to be organised in forward areas from personnel <b>shipped</b> <b>from</b> Japan. Upon formation, the 56th Independent Mixed Brigade {{was assigned to the}} Borneo Defence Force (BDF).|$|E
5|$|During the English {{occupation}} of Scotland under the Commonwealth, fortresses {{in the style}} of the trace italienne were built. These were polygonal in plan with triangular bastions, as at Ayr, Inverness and Leith. Twenty smaller forts were built as far away as Orkney and Stornoway. Control of the Highlands was secured by strongpoints at Inverlocky and Inverness. These were built at a massive cost in money and manpower. The citadel at Inverness, begun in 1652 and using stone <b>shipped</b> <b>from</b> as far away as Aberdeen, had cost £50,0000 when it was still unfinished by 1655. Inverlochy had a garrison of 1,000 and from 1654 became the centre for a new administrative region of Lochaber, made up of three of the most remote and lawless shires.|$|E
5|$|During {{the mid-19th}} century the area {{developed}} into a major saw-milling region, supplying the newly developing town of Dunedin with timber <b>shipped</b> <b>from</b> the ports of Waikawa and Fortrose. A -long jetty was built at Fortrose in 1875, although this has long since disappeared. Several shipwrecks occurred along the treacherous coastline during this period. Most notably, one of New Zealand's worst shipping disasters occurred here: {{the wreck of the}} passenger-steamer Tararua, en route from Bluff to Port Chalmers, which foundered off Waipapa Point on 29 April 1881 with the loss of all but 20 of the 151 people aboard.|$|E
