Metal-finishing industries constitute a highly <b>sensitive</b> <b>sector</b> {{that is responsible}} for important metal emissions to the environment. Due to ever increasing regulatory driving forces, more stringent and usually more expensive treatment methodologies must be used to achieve lower metal releases to the environment. This issue has forced many industries to pursue “greener” technologies (Baral and Engelken 2002) and to develop better treatment methods.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} simple two-sector dynamic model {{to examine the}} effects of {{international}} trade in the presence of pollution-created cross- sectoral production externalities. We assume that the production of 'Smokestack' manufactures generates pollution, which lowers the productivity of an environmentally <b>sensitive</b> <b>sector</b> ('Farming'). As a result, the long run production set is non-convex. Pollution provides a motive for trade, since trade can spatially separate incompatible industries. Two identical, unregulated countries will gain from trade if the share of world income spent on Smokestack is high. In contrast, when the share of world income spent on the dirty good is low, trade can usher in a negatively reinforcing process of environmental degradation and real income loss for the exporter of Smokestack. ...|$|E

While the manufacturing and other environmentally sensitive sectors are expected to contribute positively towards sustainable development, it is also logical that major creditors (banks) to these industries do same.

Our conclusion justifies the effort invested in designing new policy instruments and also has relevance for policy making in a very <b>sensitive</b> <b>sector</b> to accomplish sustainability goals – the use of renewable energy. It has been concluded that renewable energies could be better promoted if a mix of policy instruments is applied. The study was conducted using the knowledge base built up through research of literature and national experiences in promoting renewable energy sources. It has demonstrated the necessity of developing complex support schemes by identifying logical connections between the instruments used in different countries and the use of renewable energy sources.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to give a {{qualitative}} assessment of the impact of " 1992 " on a region of centre-east of Italy, Marche, under the new interesting theory of economic geography. Two basic approaches were used: that of EC that identifies 40 <b>sensitive</b> <b>sectors</b> to 1992, coupled with the presence of highly skilled labour, and the economic geography approach that looks at location, at the migration of people into the area and at the enodowment of infrastucture. The social and economic indicators suggest that the so-called <b>sensitive</b> <b>sectors</b> of the region (like textiles, clothing and footwear) are not likely to be that sensitive to 1992 : trade policy is going to matter more. Skill-intensive sectors (like mechanical engineering) will face a more critical time. The low capital formation of the region and the low endowment of potential human capital for these sectors support this argument. However, the positive migration to the region over the past few years reflects the optimistic expectations about the future growth of the economy...|$|R

The possible impacts of EU membership on Estonian foreign trade have been discussed for years without reaching a clear conclusion. Although the current paper does not purport to offer definitive results, it does shed light on the matter by presenting the main arguments raised by the debate. Using economic theory as a framework for analysis, the paper first discusses the effects of EU membership on the volume and structure of trade, followed by an evaluation of the likely impact on Estonia 2 ̆ 019 s trading partners. The majority of the studies surveyed here find that, overall, the trade-creation effect will dominate following EU membership, although trade diversion will occur in <b>sensitive</b> <b>sectors</b> of the economy.

40|$|This {{theoretical}} paper {{intends to}} provide {{an explanation of the}} implementation of behind-the-border policies, border policies, and of the inefficiency of trade negotiations. We consider a general equilibrium model of international trade with two identical countries, two commodities, a terms-of-trade externality, and a double-tier informational problem. First, domestic producers have private information on their technology. This first layer of asymmetric information affects the design of behind-the-border policies. To reduce the information rent of those producers and ease incentive compatibility constraints, behind-the-border policies must contract domestic supply. Autarky prices are thus modified so that international trade appears. The informationally <b>sensitive</b> <b>sector</b> becomes an import sector and the more so, the greater the political influence of high-cost producers.

40|$|Weather affects {{four basic}} {{purchasing}} decisions: what, when, where {{and in what}} quantity to buy. Even though retail is not traditionally perceived to be a weather <b>sensitive</b> <b>sector,</b> results of studies show that weather has {{a significant impact on}} store traffic and sales of numerous product categories.

40|$|Despite its {{contribution}} to the economy, the resources sector faces growing pressure from stakeholders, including investors and regulators, for managing {{the environmental impacts of}} its operations. Being an environmentally <b>sensitive</b> <b>sector,</b> resource sector companies should provide disclosures of their environmental footprint in their annual and/or sustainability reports. However, it is claimed that, given that environmental disclosures in annual and sustainability reports are largely voluntary, the quality of those disclosures are questionable with respect to their relevance and faithful representation. Therefore, the overall objective of this thesis was to explore the quality of environmental disclosures by Australian resources sector companies. This was undertaken through an assessment of quality based on existing reporting frameworks and assessment of investors’ perspectives on the quality of disclosures. Thus, the aim of the project was twofold: first, to identify the extent to which corporate environmental disclosures align with the quality attributes suggested in established regulatory guidelines and frameworks; and second, to obtain investors’ perspectives regarding corporate environmental initiatives and environmental disclosures...|$|E
