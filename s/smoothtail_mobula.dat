50|$|Mobula munkiana, {{commonly}} known as the manta de monk, Munk's devil ray, pygmy devil ray, or <b>smoothtail</b> <b>mobula,</b> is a species of ray in the family Myliobatidae. It is found in tropical parts of the eastern Pacific Ocean, ranging from the Gulf of California to Peru, as well as offshore islands such as the Galapagos, Cocos, and Malpelo. Munk's devil ray was first described in 1987 by the Italian ecologist Giuseppe Notarbartolo di Sciara.|$|E
50|$|The bentfin devil ray, {{lesser devil}} ray, smoothtail devil ray, <b>smoothtail</b> <b>mobula,</b> or Thurston's devil ray (Mobula thurstoni) is {{a species of}} fish in the family Myliobatidae. It is found {{worldwide}} in tropical, subtropical and warm temperate oceans, with records from Australia, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Eritrea, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Ivory Coast, Japan, Malaysia, Maldives, Mexico, Myanmar, Nicaragua, Oman, Pakistan, Peru, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, United States (California), Uruguay and Vanuatu. It likely occurs in many other locations in tropical, subtropical and warm temperate oceans. It is found both offshore and near the coast.|$|E
40|$|The generic {{diagnosis}} of Nagmia Nagaty, 1930, is emended to include species having some vitelline follicles extending into the extracecal space. Two new species belonging in the genus are described from the Gulf of California: Nagmia rodmani n. sp. {{from the body}} cavity of the giant electric ray, Narcine entemedor Jordan and Starks, 1895, and Nagmia cisloi n. sp. from the body cavity of the <b>smoothtail</b> <b>mobula,</b> Mobula thurstoni (Lloyd, 1908). Both species are distinguished {{from each other and}} the 13 other known congeners by the number of testicular follicles, ratio of widths of oral sucker to ventral sucker, and position of the vitelline follicles relative to the ceca. Nagmia rodmani is distinct based on the combined features: 12 - 17 follicles per testis, sucker width ratio of 1 : 1. 7 - 2. 0, vitelline follicles extending into the extracecal space, and the excretory vesicle being I-shaped and lacking perpendicular lateral branches along the main stem. Nagmia cisloi is distinct based on the combined features: 23 - 26 follicles per testis, body measuring 13. 4 mm long by 14. 6 mm wide, eggs measuring 47 - 48 μm long by 43 - 47 μm wide, and the excretory vesicle is I-shaped and has lateral perpendicular branches along the main stem. Supplemental data are provided for the anaporrhutine species Probolitrema richiardii (López, 1888) collected from a variety of rays in the Gulf of California. Our specimens are indistinguishable from those described as Probolitrema californiense Stunkard, 1935, and Probolitrema mexicana Markell (1956), both of which previously had been synonymized under P. richiardii. Checklists of parasites reported from N. entemedor and M. thurstoni are provided...|$|E
