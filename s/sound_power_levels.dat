50|$|For {{industrial}} noise map production, {{the most important}} thing is the description of noise sources: <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> <b>levels,</b> directivity, working periods. Although some databases can be found, in some cases it is necessary to make measurements (ISO 3740) for describing the source.

The creation of a good acoustic model can be quite complicated, and only experienced consultants can front this difficult task.|$|E

Combined with the reverberant effects of underground mines, a miner without proper hearing protection is at a high risk for hearing loss. By age 50, nearly 90% of U.S. coal miners have some hearing loss, compared to only 10% among workers not exposed to loud noises. Roof bolters are among the loudest machines, but auger miners, bulldozers, continuous mining machines, front end loaders, and shuttle cars and trucks are also among those machines most responsible for excessive noise in mine work.|$|E

40|$|Refinements {{have been}} made to a method for {{estimating}} the modal <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> <b>levels</b> of a ducted fan ingesting distorted inflow. By assuming that each propagating circumferential mode consists only of a single radial mode (the one with the highest cut-off ratio), circumferential mode <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> <b>levels</b> can be computed for a variety of inflow distortion patterns and operating speeds. Predictions from the refined theory have been compared to data from an experiment conducted in the Advanced Noise Control Fan at NASA Glenn Research Center.

The rods were placed at an axial location one rotor chord length upstream of the fan and arranged in both regular and irregular circumferential patterns. The fan was operated at 2000, 1800, and 1400 rpm. Acoustic pressure levels were measured in the fan inlet and exhaust ducts using the Rotating Rake fan mode measurement system.

40|$|At present, {{airborne}} sound {{power is not}} a directly measurable quantity. It is calculated from sound pressure measurements performed in special environments, e. g. free or diffuse fields or from sound intensity measurements using 2 -microphone probes. All the different methods are lacking traceability and transparent uncertainty budgets. These deficiencies are finally based {{on the lack of}} a primary standard for sound power as the metrological basis. In the joint research project funded by the European Metrology Research Program, primary sound power standards were established on the base of the Rayleigh Integral Method where the sound power is calculated from measured velocities on a baffled vibrating body. Different reference sound power sources were designed in different Institutes. The construction of the primary sources was mainly focused on the piston; its material, shape and friction during its movement. Primary sound power sources were installed in hemi anechoic and reverberant environments, and characterisation measurements were performed to see the effect of different environments on the sound power output. Comparison measurements were performed to compare the new and present methods for the primary sound power source. © 2016, German Acoustical Society (DEGA). All rights reserved.

To collect all these information for determining the propagation attenuation will lead to a complicated measurement procedure, which is desired to simplify. In the European Imagine project we propose a practical method to determine the <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> of railway rolling noise using one-microphone recordings. Using a standard measurement position (7. 5 m from the track centre and 1. 2 m above railhead) the time history of the sound pressure level of a train passage will be recorded. When choosing the special time interval Tp and calculating the equivalent sound pressure level for this time period, the corresponding <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> <b>level</b> can easily be obtained by using the tabled constants. Applying this method to determine the <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> <b>level</b> one needs only to record the sound pressure level of train passages. The measurement procedure is much simplified. To limit errors this method requires a railway bed of a height between 0 and 2 m above a roughly flat terrain that the ground impedance value(s) is not less than 200 kPas/m^ 2. Wind speed should be less than 5 m/s and a train length not shorter than 70 m. In real life these requirements can easily be satisfied so the method is really practical...|$|R

40|$|Numerical {{predictions}} of the acoustic characteristics of an Active Twist Rotor (ATR), using two methods to compute the rotor blade aerodynamics and elastic blade motion are compared to experimental data from a wind tunnel test in the NASA Langley Transonic Dynamics Tunnel (TDT) in 2000. The first method, a loosely coupled iterative method, utilizes the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code OVERFLOW 2 and the Computational Structural Dynamics (CSD) code CAMRAD II. The second method utilizes the CAMRAD II free-wake model only. The harmonic active-twist control to the main rotor blade system is identified with three parameters - harmonic actuation frequency, actuation amplitude, and control phase angle. The resulting aerodynamics and blade motion data from the two methods are then used in the acoustics code PSU-WOPWOP to predict acoustic pressure on a spherical array of equally spaced observers surrounding the rotor. This spherical distribution of pressure is used to compute the sound power level representing baseline and actuated conditions. <b>Sound</b> <b>power</b> <b>levels</b> for three categories of noise are defined as - blade-vortex interaction sound power level (BVIPWL), low frequency sound power level (LFPWL), and overall sound power level, OAPWL.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} part of a major {{research}} project to analyse vibro-acoustic characteristics from variable speed inverter driven induction motors (VSIDIM). The overall projects’ aimed at providing {{a better understanding of the}} mechanisms of sound generation from electromagnetic origins and developing a numerical model to predict the <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> emitted from a VSIDIM. The scope of this thesis is to assess experimentally the effect of various controller strategies on the radiated <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> and to develop a finite element method for calculating the electromagnetic force distribution over the stator. Various sources of noise in induction motors and their behaviour with speed and load have been reviewed. Models of the electromagnetic field and vibro-acoustic character have been discussed. An outline of various techniques of reducing noise in induction motors through design of inverters and modifications to the motor structure has been given. Experiments were conducted to assess the effect of controller strategies on the radiated <b>sound</b> <b>power.</b> Three different supplies were tested: a dynamotor which produces an almost sinusoidal supply with very low harmonic content, an inverter with a low switching frequency (less than 1 kHz) and an inverter with a high switching frequency (8 kHz) and various levels of random modulation. Results indicate that the <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> <b>level</b> of the MSC drive is a lot higher than that of the VSC 2000 drive and the dynamotor drive. The <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> <b>level</b> of the VSC 2000 drive and the dynamotor drive increases almost linearly with motor speed, that for the MSC drive is almost independent of speed. The <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> <b>level</b> of the MSC drive is almost 28 dB higher than that of the dynamotor drive at 450 rpm and the difference is reduced to 14 dB at 1500 rpm where the aerodynamic noise becomes more dominant. It has been found that at the rated speed (1500 rpm), the <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> <b>level</b> varies by less than 3 dB from no load to full load for all three sources. Although increasing the switching frequency increases the cost of the inverters and switching losses, results from the MSC and VSC 2000 drives clearly show that it reduces the radiated <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> by shifting the harmonics into higher and inaudible frequency range. The tonal nature around the switching frequency has been reduced by increasing the levels of random modulation to spread the energy over a wider range of frequencies, although the <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> <b>level</b> has not varied by more than 0. 2 dB. A finite element model has been developed to calculate the electromagnetic force distribution. The quasi-static solution method has been implemented by stepping the rotor through the time domain using a fine regular mesh in the air gap. The stator currents were experimentally obtained while the rotor currents were obtained using a 4 parameter state space model of the motor. Results of the simulation indicate the influence of stator and rotor slots, saturation and time harmonics in the current. The calculated electromagnetic force distribution has been used in a FEM/BEM acoustic model and SEA acoustic model to predict the radiated <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> which agrees reasonably well with the measured sound, thus validating indirectly the electromagnetic force simulations...|$|R
