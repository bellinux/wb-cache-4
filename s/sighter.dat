2500|$|May 2009: An {{article about}} the German {{journalist}} Richard Herzinger in the German Wikipedia was vandalized. The IP user added that Herzinger, who wrote for Die Welt, was Jewish; the <b>sighter</b> marked this as [...] "sighted" [...] (meaning {{that there is no}} vandalism in the article). Herzinger complained about that to Wikipedians who immediately deleted the assertion. According to Herzinger, who wrote about the incident in a newspaper article, he is regularly called a Jew by right-wing extremists due to his perceived pro-Israel stance.|$|E

50|$|F-Class matches are all slow-fire, prone {{shooting}} ‘for score’. There {{are primarily}} two courses of fire in most major F-Class tournaments. A Palma match {{consists of three}} stages, 800, 900 and 1000 yards, with 15 shots for record at each distance. At 800 yards, the shooter is allowed unlimited <b>sighters.</b> However, only two <b>sighters</b> are allowed at 900 yards and 1000 yards. That dictates a different strategy for the longer distances. A tournament may consist {{of two or three}} Palma matches. The other course of fire that we commonly shoot has stages at 600 yards and 1000 yards, with 15- or 20-shot strings at each distance. A tournament will be three to five strings at each yardage, usually with unlimited <b>sighters</b> for each string.|$|R
50|$|The beings {{show the}} two {{visitors}} hyperspacial <b>sighters</b> - valuable instruments for galactic navigation - despite the planet never having been visited by humans before. They indicate {{that more of}} the instruments {{are to be found}} on the neighbouring planet and the explorers leave in a hurry to visit it; never stopping to consider the impossibility of the situation. On the second planet, they meet aquatic snake-like creatures who offer them more <b>sighters.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{course of}} fire is an {{unlimited}} number of <b>sighter</b> shots followed by 60 competition shots for men or 40 competition shots for women, all fired within 75 minutes for men or 50 minutes for women. During this initial or qualification phase {{a maximum of}} 10 points are awarded for each shot.|$|E

5000|$|... "Co-ed" [...] or [...] "Mixed" [...] {{male and}} female {{shooters}} compete together in certain events. Shooting is conducted in 2 stages: Qualification and Finals. In the 2013-2016 ISSF Rules, Air Rifle Prone (R3) and [...]22 Rifle Prone (R6) competitors for example, have unlimited <b>sighters</b> 15 minutes before the 60 competition shots due within 50 minutes. The new Finals are also conducted with the top 8 shooters starting from zero, {{with a focus on}} the decimal duel to clearly determine medal winners.|$|R
50|$|Meteor expert Dr. Lincoln LaPaz headed {{much of the}} {{investigation}} into the fireballs on behalf of the military. LaPaz's conclusion was that the objects displayed too many anomalous characteristics to be a type of meteor and instead were artificial, perhaps secret Russian spy devices. The green fireballs were seen by many people of high repute including LaPaz, distinguished Los Alamos scientists, Kirtland AFB intelligence officers and Air Command Defense personnel. A February 1949 Los Alamos conference attended by aforementioned <b>sighters,</b> Project Sign, world-renowned upper atmosphere physicist Dr. Joseph Kaplan, H-bomb scientist Dr. Edward Teller, other scientists and military brass concluded, though far from unanimously, that green fireballs were natural phenomena. To the conference attendees, though the green fire ball source was unknown, their existence was unquestioned. Secret conferences were convened at Los Alamos to study the phenomenon and in Washington by the U.S. Air Force Scientific Advisory Board.|$|R
60|$|These rifles {{were of a}} {{white metal}} stocked with wood, which I learned later was a very light and {{intensely}} hard growth much prized on Mars, and entirely unknown to us denizens of Earth. The metal of the barrel is an alloy composed principally of aluminum and steel which they have learned to temper to a hardness far exceeding that of the steel with which we are familiar. The weight of these rifles is comparatively little, and with the small caliber, explosive, radium projectiles which they use, and the great length of the barrel, they are deadly in the extreme and at ranges which would be unthinkable on Earth. The theoretic effective radius of this rifle is three hundred miles, but {{the best they can}} do in actual service when equipped with their wireless finders and <b>sighters</b> is but a trifle over two hundred miles.|$|R
5000|$|He was {{succeeded by}} his son Rabbi Chananya Yom Tov Lipa Teitelbaum (d.1904) Rabbi Chanaya Yom Tov Lipa's most famous {{contribution}} to <b>Sighter</b> Hasidus is the work Kedushas Yom Tov, a commentary on the Chumash. After him it would become customary for the Rebbe of Sighet to author a commentary on the Torah. He was also the father of Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum who, at the time, {{was known as the}} illui (child prodigee) from Sighet.|$|E

50|$|As laser {{technology}} {{has become less}} expensive, laser bore sighters have become popular for sighting in rifles. One type of laser bore sight is inserted into the chamber and projects a beam through the barrel onto the target. The user then adjusts the rifle scope until the crosshairs are on the laser dot. Another type of laser bore <b>sighter</b> is more universal and {{is attached to the}} end of the barrel. It is held in alignment with the barrel and projects a laser beam onto the target. Again, the user aligns the crosshairs to the laser dot on the target.|$|E
5000|$|Male {{shooters}} shoot a [...]22 LR calibre rifle (smallbore) over {{a course}} of fire of 60 shots to count, after unlimited sighting shots, in a time limit of 1 hour and 15 minutes (when using electronic targets). If necessary, an 'elimination' course of fire may be undertaken {{to reduce the number}} of shooters to the number that may fire simultaneously in a 'qualification' round. Each shot may score from 0 to 10 points, with no decimal points (e.g. 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, but not 3.2 or 9.8 etc.) The maximum score for an elimination or qualification round is 600 points. The top 8 shooters in the qualification round will be selected to shoot 'shot-for-shot' in an 'Olympic' final. The final is 10 shots, shot after a five-minute period for unlimited <b>sighters.</b> The 10 shots are shot on command in a 45-second time-span, where each shooter must shoot one shot. Following each individual finals shot, the individual shooter's score for that shot is read to the audience. Shots in the final are scored to one decimal place, e.g. a shooter may score 9.8 or 10.6 in the finals for a shot, whereas in the qualification or elimination round those same shots would score 9 or 10 respectively. The maximum score for 10 shots in the finals is 109.0, with 10.9 being the maximum score for each shot. The Finals score for the 10 shots is added to the score for the qualification round.|$|R
5000|$|Known Distance (KD) Appleseed Rifle Marksmanship {{clinics are}} also held {{separately}} for advanced students and instructors. These require center fire rifles only, and typically are started with initial sighting-in being done at 25 meters for setting Battle Sight Zeroes, followed by shooting at known distances of 100, 200, 300, and 400 yards, as a minimum. Where ranges physically can allow shooting further, students are also usually {{given an opportunity}} to shoot at 500 yards, 600 yards, and even longer distances, for determining precise data on personal equipment (DOPE), out to the limits of the particular range where the KD Appleseed is being held. The usual course of study is a classroom lecture for half of the first day, covering intermediate to advanced topics related to ranging, come-ups, mitigating wind, and related topics, followed by shooting <b>sighters</b> at 25 meters, and again at all distances that will be shot. Although most KD Appleseeds are 2 days in length, some KD Appleseeds are continued into a third day, during which time [...] "Top Shot" [...] and similar contests are held, consisting of target detection, followed by ranging the unknown distances to the detected targets, and, finally, shooting for score onto the targets. All instructors, despite having repeatedly previously shot a Rifleman score, equivalent to Expert on the old Army Qualification Test, are additionally required to re-qualify at least annually, in terms of shooting repeat Rifleman scores, at both short and long distances. KD Appleseeds are usually held only {{once or twice a year}} in each state, whereas regular Appleseeds typically are held several times a month in most states.|$|R
5000|$|Boresight is {{a method}} of {{adjustment}} to an optical firearm sight or iron sights, to align the firearm barrel and sights. This method is usually used to pre-align the sights, which makes zeroing (zero drop at XX distance) much faster. A device called a bore <b>sighter</b> or collimator is used to accomplish this. [...] It consists of an optical head and a bore-diameter arbor which is inserted into the muzzle of the rifle. The optical head is then attached to the protruding end of the rod. A grid pattern on the optical head is then used to align the sights with the barrel.|$|E
50|$|Later {{that year}} a giant penguin was {{allegedly}} sighted at distance. The huge bird {{was described as}} 15 feet (4.5 meters) tall, and having alligator-like feet. During this same period, people in a boat off the Florida gulf coast reported seeing an extremely large penguin-like bird floating on the water. These incidents were reported in several newspapers. Later that year, another huge, penguin-like bird was allegedly seen from an airplane {{on the banks of}} the Suwannee River in northern Florida. The <b>sighter,</b> zoologist Ivan T. Sanderson, declared that the creature was a giant penguin that had somehow been driven away from its natural habitat.|$|E
5000|$|For {{these two}} reasons, when news of Bose's death was reported, {{many in the}} INA refused to believe it {{and were able to}} {{transmit}} their disbelief to a wider public. The source of the widespread skepticism in the INA might have been Bose's senior officer J. R. Bhonsle. Bhonsle, unlike some other senior officers, had been kept in the dark about Bose's final plans, in part because he had also become an agent for the British. When a Japanese delegation, which included General Isoda, visited Bhonsle on 19 August 1945 to break the news and offer condolences, he responded by telling Isoda that Bose had not died, rather his disappearance has been covered up. Even Mohandas Gandhi swiftly said that he was skeptical about the air crash, but changed his mind after meeting the Indian survivor Habibur Rahman. As in 1940, before long, in 1945, rumours were rife about what had happened to Bose, whether he was in Soviet-held Manchuria, a prisoner of the Soviet army, or whether he had gone into hiding with the cooperation of the Soviet army. Lakshmi Swaminathan, of the all-female Rani of Jhansi regiment of the INA, later Lakshmi Sahgal, said in spring 1946 that she thought Bose was in China. Many rumours spoke of Bose preparing for his final march on Delhi. This was the time when Bose began to be sighted by people, one <b>sighter</b> claiming [...] "he had met Bose in a third-class compartment of the Bombay express on a Thursday." ...|$|E
