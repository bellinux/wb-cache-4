5|$|A {{much larger}} star, however, is massive {{enough to create}} {{temperatures}} and pressures needed to cause the carbon in the core to begin to fuse when the star contracts {{at the end of}} the helium-burning stage. The cores of these massive stars become layered like onions as progressively heavier atomic nuclei build up at the center, with an outermost layer of hydrogen gas, <b>surrounding</b> <b>a</b> layer of hydrogen fusing into helium, <b>surrounding</b> <b>a</b> layer of helium fusing into carbon via the triple-alpha process, surrounding layers that fuse to progressively heavier elements. As a star this massive evolves, it undergoes repeated stages where fusion in the core stops, and the core collapses until the pressure and temperature are sufficient to begin the next stage of fusion, reigniting to halt collapse.|$|E

5|$|A related process, {{flux-cored}} {{arc welding}} (FCAW), uses similar equipment but uses wire {{consisting of a}} steel electrode <b>surrounding</b> <b>a</b> powder fill material.

The exclusion was a government response to a finding by the Equality Tribunal that a same-sex couple was discriminated against in travel privileges.|$|E

5|$|With over 400 active volcanos, Io is {{the most}} geologically active object in the Solar System. Its surface is dotted with more than 100 mountains, {{some of which are}} taller than Earth's Mount Everest.

5|$|Beyond {{the area}} of Roman occupation, {{in the west and}} north, there are over 60 sites {{identified}} of wheelhouses. Perhaps a development of earlier Atlantic roundhouses, these have a characteristic outer wall <b>surrounding</b> <b>a</b> circle of stone piers (bearing a resemblance to the spokes of a wheel). Over 400 souterrains, small underground constructions, have been discovered in Scotland, many of them in the south-east, and although few have been dated, those that have suggest a construction date in the second or third centuries CE. They are usually found close to settlements (whose timber frames are much less well-preserved) and may have been for storing perishable agricultural products.|$|E

5|$|Fringe is an American {{science fiction}} {{television}} series created by J. J. Abrams, Alex Kurtzman, and Roberto Orci. It premiered on the Fox network on September 9, 2008, and concluded on January 18, 2013, after five seasons and 100 episodes. The series follows Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson), and Walter Bishop (John Noble), {{all members of}} the fictional Fringe Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, based in Boston, Massachusetts, under the supervision of Homeland Security. The team uses fringe science and FBI investigative techniques to investigate a series of unexplained, often ghastly occurrences, which are related to mysteries <b>surrounding</b> <b>a</b> parallel universe.|$|E
5|$|In Chinese astronomy, most of {{the stars}} of Serpens {{represented}} part of a wall <b>surrounding</b> <b>a</b> marketplace, known as Tianshi, which was in Ophiuchus and part of Hercules. Serpens also contains a few Chinese constellations. Two stars in the tail represented part of Shilou, the tower with the market office. Another star in the tail represented Liesi, jewel shops. One star in the head (Mu Serpentis) marked Tianru, the crown prince's wet nurse, or sometimes rain.|$|E
5|$|In the chaetonotidans, the {{excretory}} system {{consists of}} {{a single pair of}} protonephridia, which open through separate pores on the lateral underside of the animal, usually in the midsection of the body. In the macrodasyidans, there are several pairs of these opening {{along the side of the}} body. Nitrogenous waste is probably excreted through the body wall, as part of respiration, and the protonephridia are believed to function mainly in osmoregulation. Unusually, the protonephridia do not take the form of flame cells, but, instead, the excretory cells consist of a skirt <b>surrounding</b> <b>a</b> series of cytoplasmic rods that in turn enclose a central flagellum. These cells, termed cyrtocytes, connect to a single outlet cell which passes the excreted material into the protonephridial duct.|$|E

5|$|Later, in 1993, Gerard 't Hooft wrote a {{speculative}} {{paper on}} quantum gravity {{in which he}} revisited Hawking's work on black hole thermodynamics, concluding that {{the total number of}} degrees of freedom in a region of spacetime <b>surrounding</b> <b>a</b> black hole is proportional to the surface area of the horizon. This idea was promoted by Leonard Susskind and is now known as the holographic principle. The holographic principle and its realization in string theory through the AdS/CFT correspondence have helped elucidate the mysteries of black holes suggested by Hawking's work and are believed to provide a resolution of the black hole information paradox. In 2004, Hawking conceded that black holes do not violate quantum mechanics, and he suggested a concrete mechanism by which they might preserve information.|$|E
5|$|Of the six {{divisions}} encamped on {{the western}} side of the Tennessee River in early April, only Lew Wallace's 3rd Division was at Crump's Landing; the remainder were farther south (upriver) at Pittsburg Landing. Grant developed a reputation during the war for being more concerned with his own plans than with those of the enemy. His encampment at Pittsburg Landing displayed his most consequential lack of such concern—his army was spread out in bivouac style, with many of his men <b>surrounding</b> <b>a</b> small, log meetinghouse named Shiloh Church (Shiloh was a biblical city that served as the capital of the Kingdom of Israel), passing the time waiting for Buell's army with drills for his many raw troops without establishing entrenchments or other significant defensive measures.|$|E

Now out of Central Islip, the route traverses industrialized areas <b>surrounding</b> <b>a</b> large Y intersection with CR17 (Wheeler Road) in Hauppauge. NY111 takes on the Wheeler Road name, and the route immediately enters an interchange (exit56) with the Long Island Expressway (I-495). From here, the route bends northeast along Wheeler Road, paralleling the Nissequogue River as it serves the northern part of the town of Islip.|$|E
