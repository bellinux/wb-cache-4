50|$|Sullivan is a tenured {{associate}} professor of dance at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro's College of Visual and Performing Arts. Her research is in choreography and in her original dance technique. Sullivan discovered <b>Safety</b> <b>Release</b> technique, a postmodern dance technique with a heavy emphasis on floor work and breathing. This technique blends movement principals with somatic and release applications, combining health practicalities with artistic development. She has taught <b>Safety</b> <b>Release</b> technique at Dance New Amsterdam in New York City, Interlochen Arts Academy, and as a summer faculty member of the University of North Carolina School of the Arts.|$|R
