40|$|Abstract:- Burns {{is a very}} {{critical}} area of medicine citing the doctors {{to be on their}} toes. The prognosis being lowest and treatment the hardest, this area has not cited much research. Largely these medico legal cases are accidental and rare around the world but Indian scenar io is opposite. A rural set up here will admit a minimum of two burn cases a day, with 50 % chances of it being an inhalational burn. Grave is the prognosis of these patients but attempts if made properly by trained indivisuals can help save life on the edge of death. Method: 52 patients were selected randomly from the casualty of PRH, Loni and were alternately allocated in two groups. The group with traditional approach was named GROUP A and had 16 Patients. The group with changed approach was named GROUP B and it also had 16 Patients. OF them 2 patients from group a died due to <b>severe</b> <b>deep</b> <b>burns</b> in wards, while one patient from group B was shifted to a other burn centre. This led to the final sample size to be 49. The group B received immediate chest physiotherapy as compared to group A which received the same treatment 3 Days later. Result: Team approach and early physiotherapy i. e. immediately as the patient is stabilized and shifted to the burn ward, improves the chest condition, prevents post burn chest complications, facilitates healthy recovery and helps improve the prognosis. Conclusion; chest Physiotherapy in immediate Post Burn period is Important and plays a vital role in rehabilitating the patient. It also affects the survival rat...|$|E

40|$|Regeneration {{of sweat}} glands after <b>deep</b> <b>burns</b> {{has been an}} unsolved problem. Owing to lack of perspiration, {{survivors}} of an extensive <b>deep</b> <b>burn</b> injury are leading a miserable life in sultry months. It was our contemplation {{to solve this problem}} by inducing bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to acquire the phenotype of sweat gland cells in vitro. Then these cells were transplanted into fresh skin wounds resulting from excision of anhydrotic scars after healing of <b>deep</b> <b>burn</b> injury in five patients. Two to 12 months after the procedure, it was proved that there was recovery of perspiration function in all the MSCs' transplanted areas, as evidenced by positive iodine-starch perspiration test. Histological and biochemical observation confirmed the involvement of MSCs transformed sweat gland cells in the recovery of functional sweat glands, and the components of sweat collected from these areas were similar to that collected from normal skin. This is the first report of successful transplantation of MSCs in regenerating functional sweat glands, which may help solve the problem of depletion of sweat glands in patients surviving extensive <b>deep</b> <b>burns</b> in the future. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{experimental}} {{studies have shown}} several benefits of treating burns by the immediate application of cool water. In this study of 695 children with burns, treated in the National Burn Institute (NBI), Hanoi, Vietnam, patients were assessed on admission according to first aid measures {{at the time of}} injury, i. e. the removal of the cause and immediate cooling with cold water. A total of 33 % of the children who had had immediate cooling of the burn with water had <b>deep</b> <b>burns,</b> compared with 49 % of the children who had not had immediate cooling. The prevalence ratio of <b>deep</b> <b>burns</b> was thus 0. 68 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 55 – 0. 85); that is, there was an estimated reduction of 32 % in the need for skin grafting, a reduction which was statistically significant. After adjusting for the effect of cooling the burn, removal of the causal agent reduced the odds of requiring skin grafting, but the reduction was not statistically significant. It is concluded that early cooling will prevent a significant percentage of superficial burns from progressing to <b>deep</b> <b>burns.</b> This will not only reduce the probability that skin grafting and expensive treatment will be required, but will reduce the risk of other consequences of <b>deep</b> <b>burns,</b> which may be fatal. Public health programs to promote immediate cooling of burns with cool water are at least as important as subsequent medical and surgical treatment in determining the outcome of burns in children.

40|$|Determination of burn {{severity}} (i. e. burn depth) {{is important}} for effective medical management and treatment. Using a recently described acute burn model, we studied various morphological parameters to detect burn severity. Anaesthetized Sprague–Dawley rats received burns of various severity (0 - to 14 -s contact time) followed by standard resuscitation using intravenous fluids. Biopsies were taken from each site after 5 h, tissues fixed in 10 % neutral-buffered formalin, processed and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Superficial burn changes in the epidermis included early keratinocyte swelling progressing to epidermal thinning and nuclear elongation in <b>deeper</b> <b>burns.</b> Subepidermal vesicle formation generally decreased with <b>deeper</b> <b>burns</b> and typically contained grey foamy fluid. Dermal burns were typified by hyalinized collagen {{and a lack of}} detectable individual collagen fibres on a background of grey to pale eosinophilic seroproteinaceous fluid. Intact vascular structures were identified principally <b>deep</b> to the <b>burn</b> area in the collagen. Follicle cell injury was identified by cytoplasmic clearing/swelling and nuclear pyknosis, and these follicular changes were often the <b>deepest</b> evidence of <b>burn</b> injury seen for each time point. Histological scores (epidermal changes) or dermal parameter depths (dermal changes) were regressed on burn contact time. Collagen alteration (r 2 = 0. 91) correlated best to burn severity followed by vascular patency (r 2 = 0. 82), epidermal changes (r 2 = 0. 76), subepidermal vesicle formation (r 2 = 0. 74) and follicular cell injury was useful in all but <b>deep</b> <b>burns.</b> This study confirms key morphological parameters can be an important tool for the detection of burn severity in this acute burn model...|$|R
40|$|Introduction The {{healing of}} grafted areas after {{surgical}} treatment of <b>deep</b> <b>burns</b> frequently generates mutilating scars, and rises {{the risk of}} subsequent scar hypertrophy. Scar assessment based on clinical evaluation is inherently subjective, which stimulates search for objective means of evaluation. Objective The {{aim of this study}} was to objectively evaluate the effect of using autologous platelet concentrate (APC) in combination with split thickness skin grafting (STSG) on scarring processes following surgery of <b>deep</b> <b>burns</b> as compared with application of STSG alone. Method Selected viscoelastic properties of 38 scars on 23 patients in total were examined using the Cutometer MPA 580 under controlled conditions for long-term outcomes 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery following <b>deep</b> <b>burns.</b> Results The findings of this study suggest that the STSG + APC combination reduces the time of scar viscoelastic properties recovery as compared with application of STSG alone. This was statistically significant for viscoelastic parameters R 2 and Q 1. Conclusion APC has been advocated to enhance scarring after surgery of deep dermal and full thickness burns. We objectively demonstrated that the viscoelastic properties of scars treated with STSG + APC combination return more rapidly to the plateau state than areas treated with STSG only.
