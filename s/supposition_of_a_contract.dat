Namely, the <b>supposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> simpler, more parsimonious chain of events is preferable to the <b>supposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> more complicated, less parsimonious chain of events. Hence, parsimony (sensu lato) is typically sought in constructing phylogenetic trees, and in scientific explanation generally.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} Hegel’s {{account of}} abstract ‘understanding’ (Verstand) and asserts that his thought {{is to be}} read as primarily presenting <b>a</b> critique <b>of</b> abstract understanding.

Grasping his account and reading him in its critical light yields a very different image of Hegel than the caricature of ‘totalizing systems’. The dimension of the Verstandeskritik has been relatively neglected in Hegel-reception and misunderstandings result from trying to ‘understand’ Hegel, by overlooking the topic of ‘understanding’ in his work as critique. Many caricatures result from understanding Hegel as <b>a</b> proponent <b>of</b> what he actually critiques (‘absolute knowing’ is often understood as a mega-understanding).
