50|$|Oy M. Haloila Ab {{is one of}} the world's leading {{companies}} in the manufacture of pallet-wrapping machines. Haloila's factories are located in Masku, Finland (fully automatic <b>wrapping</b> <b>machines)</b> and Kardjali, Bulgaria (semi-automatic <b>wrapping</b> <b>machines).</b>|$|R
50|$|Other Haloila’s <b>wrapping</b> <b>machines</b> {{include the}} Cobra, Ecomat and Rolle. Over the years, the service {{business}} {{has become an}} established part of the solutions offered by the company, covering the entire life cycle of the <b>wrapping</b> <b>machines.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{most widely}} known product in Haloila’s product range is the fully {{automatic}} <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine,</b> Octopus, with over 5,500 fully automatic stretch <b>wrapping</b> <b>machines</b> manufactured so far. In 2008, the international media also spotlighted {{the manufacture of}} the 3000th Octopus machine.|$|R

40|$|PT. Sanbe Farma Unit III is an {{pharmaceutical}} company produces infusion {{as one of}} its product. In the process of packaging Flipped-off (FO) type of infusion, there is wrapping process done by <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine.</b> At this process is expected no defect product [...] However, in fact defect product is still exist. In March to May 2016 total reject products in a row are 1204 bags, 1357 bags, and 960 bags. It happened because <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine</b> is often experienced breakdown. Based of those problems above, observation is done to find the biggest loss factor of the <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine,</b> measuring overall <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine</b> effectiveness, and to do an improvement that will decrease downtime of <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine.</b> Problem solving is done by measuring Six Big Losses and use pareto diagram to find the biggest loss factor. Fishbone diagram is also used to find factors that affect the biggest loss factor. Next step is measuring Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) of <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine.</b> To measure OEE, the calculation of Availability, Performace Efficiency, and Quality rate are needed first. Then those values is compared with the world standard of each value. Based on this whole observation, there are two biggest loss factors, they are reduced speed and idling and minor stoppages. These loss factors influenced the value of Performance Efficiency which is lower than the world standard, based on the measurement that had been done. The calculation result shows that OEE value of <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine</b> from March to May 2016 are still under the standard, i. e. 82, 08...|$|R

50|$|Packaging {{machines}} are machines that complete {{stages of the}} packaging process. Examples include filling <b>machines,</b> sealing <b>machines,</b> <b>wrapping</b> <b>machines,</b> strapping machines, labelling machines and coding machines.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine</b> designs carry {{a single}} drum of cable {{on one side}} of the machine and {{therefore}} require a counterweight on the opposite side to provide lateral stability. As a minimum, the counterweight is adjustable at each pole or tower to reflect the reduced weight of the payload at the end of each span. The more sophisticated designs of <b>wrapping</b> <b>machines</b> have automatically adjusting counterweights that maintain balance throughout the span as the cable drum becomes progressively lighter. This is normally achieved by arranging for the counterweight move inwards towards the machine axis as the machine travels forward. Such devices are essential for span lengths greater than 250 - 300m. Ideally, the centre of gravity of the rotating part of the <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine</b> should lie on the axis of the host conductor at all times. The centre of gravity of the complete <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine</b> will always be below the axis of the host conductor.|$|R

50|$|The {{turning moment}} arises because the <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine</b> passes a heavy drum of cable around the machine axis {{so as to}} wrap the fibre optic cable onto the host conductor. This motion is {{achieved}} {{by means of a}} gearbox that converts the linear travel of the <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine</b> along the conductor into a rotating movement of the drum carrier. The force of moving the drum in one direction (say clockwise around the conductor) causes a resultant force to act on the machine in the opposite direction, making the <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine</b> spin on its own axis (counter-clockwise in this example). Frictional effects from the machine’s grip on the conductor can be used to counter this to some degree, but in practice it is insufficient and the required stability can only be achieved by having a relatively large weight suspended rigidly below the conductor from the non-rotating part of the <b>wrapping</b> <b>machine.</b> The motor unit is heavy, has a good grip on the conductor and so is often used to provide the necessary stability. For rope-pulled machines with no motor unit, a separate ‘keel weight’ is used to achieve the same effect.|$|R

40|$|As a new {{strategy}} for enhancing recovery after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, we developed a cell <b>sheet</b> <b>wrapped</b> graft using ACL-derived CD 34 + cells. Our results from an exvivo cell migration assay demonstrated gradual cell migration into the graft from the cell sheet, and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay indicated that the cell sheet cultures secreted a significantly greater amount of VEGF than typical monolayer cultures. In the invivo study, the rats received one of three possible ACL reconstruction treatments; 1) a tendon graft wrapped in an ACL-derived CD 34 + cell sheet, 2) a tendon graft and ACL-derived CD 34 + cell injection, or 3) the control group that received just the tendon graft. The invivo studies revealed that the ACL-derived CD 34 + cell <b>sheet</b> <b>wrapped</b> grafts demonstrated {{a greater number of}} the cells derived from the cell sheets incorporated within the bone tunnel site and grafted tendon. We believe the incorporated CD 34 + cells enhanced the healing of both the bone-tendon junction and the grafted tendon in the reconstructed rat ACLs by increasing proprioceptive recovery, graft maturation, and biomechanical strength. ACL-derived CD 34 + cell <b>sheet</b> <b>wrapped</b> grafts could become a promising strategy to revitalize tendon autografts and recovery after ACL reconstruction resulting in superior and quicker recovery in patients requiring ACL reconstruction. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} check out the effects of the method how the FRP <b>sheets</b> <b>wrapped</b> on the axial {{behavior}} of timber columns confined by CFRP sheet, 6 short columns were confined with CFRP <b>sheets</b> in different <b>wrapped</b> ways, i. e. toroidal, single helix, double helix and cross helix. Another column in the same size was prepared as contrast. The ultimate carrying capacity of the specimens was analyzed as well as the load-displacement curves and strain-stress relationships. The comparison of the ultimate carrying capacity showed significant enhancement when the specimens were confined in any ways, and the way <b>wrapping</b> FRP <b>sheets</b> in the toroidal direction was more efficient than other ways in which the FRP <b>sheets</b> <b>wrapped</b> in the experiment. The analysis of the load-displacement curves indicate that the stiffness of the specimens was improved by the reinforcement with FRP sheets in any ways, however, the improvement of the ultimate carrying capacity and the stiffness was in the cost of the ductility. The comparison of the FRP’s train between the specimens with toroidal wrapping method and the helix ones can clearly explain the lower efficiency in the enhancement of ultimate carrying capacity of the specimens with helix wrapping methods...|$|R
