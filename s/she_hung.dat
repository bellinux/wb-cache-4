5|$|Meanwhile, Victor and {{his mother}} scream at each other because she had had sex with Oscar, {{and because of that}} Victor had {{informed}} the police about Oscar's drug dealing; Victor is then thrown out of his parents' home. He shows up at Linda's apartment and apologizes for having had her brother killed, but says Linda is partially to blame since <b>she</b> <b>hung</b> around with creeps. This angers Linda, who repeatedly screams that Victor should just go kill himself.|$|E
25|$|Among other adventures, Atalanta {{participated in}} the hunt for the Calydonian Boar, which Artemis had sent to destroy Calydon because King Oeneus had {{forgotten}} her at the harvest sacrifices. In the hunt, Atalanta drew the first blood and was awarded the prize of the skin. <b>She</b> <b>hung</b> it in a sacred grove at Tegea as a dedication to Artemis.|$|E
25|$|After {{returning}} to Fitzroy Crossing, Oscar worked in state government community welfare and health departments, before becoming the Junjuwa Community Women’s Resource Officer in 1989. She then became the Chairperson of the Marra Worra Worra Aboriginal Corporation, one of Australia’s {{oldest and most}} respected Aboriginal community centres, until 1991, when she was appointed Commissioner of the Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Commission for a 2-year term. When she was 29 years old, Oscar {{received a phone call}} from Aboriginal Affairs Minister Robert Tickner asking her to join the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. <b>She</b> <b>hung</b> up the phone because she thought the call was a hoax but then decided to call him back.|$|E

Paris is washed down every morning; {{scrubbed}} and mopped and rubbed dry. You couldn't find any more dirt than you could in mother's kitchen after <b>she's</b> <b>hung</b> out her wash. That so, Mr. Westover?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Deluded child!' sighed Lavinia, {{closing her}} dizzy eyes upon the swaying {{garments}} on the wall, and feebly wishing <b>she</b> had <b>hung</b> herself along with them.|$|R

500|$|The spanking thing started because I {{believed}} that my character in Dick Tracy liked to get smacked around and that's why <b>she</b> <b>hung</b> around {{with people like}} Al Pacino's character. Warren [...] asked me to write some songs, one of them, the Hanky Panky song, was about that. I say in the song 'Nothing like a good spanky', {{and in the middle}} I say, 'Ooh, my bottom hurts just thinking about it'. When it came out everybody started asking, 'Do you like to get spanked?' and I said: 'Yeah. Yeah, I do'.|$|E
500|$|In 1950, Plath {{attended}} Smith College and excelled academically. She {{wrote to}} her mother, [...] "The world is splitting open at my feet like a ripe, juicy watermelon". She edited The Smith Review and during the summer after her third year of college was awarded a coveted position as guest editor at Mademoiselle magazine, during which she spent a month in New York City. The experience was not what she had hoped it would be, and it began a downward spiral. She was furious at not being at a meeting the editor had arranged with Welsh poet Dylan Thomas—a writer whom she loved, said one of her boyfriends, [...] "more than life itself." [...] <b>She</b> <b>hung</b> around the White Horse Tavern and the Chelsea Hotel for two days, hoping to meet Thomas, {{but he was already}} on his way home. A few weeks later, she slashed her legs to see if she had enough [...] "courage" [...] to commit suicide. Many of the events that took place during that summer were later used as inspiration for her novel The Bell Jar. During this time she was refused admission to the Harvard writing seminar. Following electroconvulsive therapy for depression, Plath made her first medically documented suicide attempt in late August 1953 by crawling under her house and taking her mother's sleeping pills.|$|E
500|$|Living {{near the}} Shawangunks during her college years, Hill pioneered many new free {{climbing}} routes. In 1984 at The Gunks she performed an on-sight first ascent of Yellow Crack (5.12c) and Vandals (5.13a); Vandals {{was the most}} difficult route on the East Coast at the time and the area's first climb of its grade. Her lead of Yellow Crack was a very dangerous ascent, her climbing partner at the time Russ Ruffa calling it [...] "one of the boldest leads I've ever seen... I had tried leading it. I knew you had to totally commit to doing the moves, otherwise the chance of surviving would be minimal. Those are the moments that really stand out—when you see someone totally on the edge." [...] It was her climb of Vandals that led Hill to reconsider her climbing style; rather than begin the climb again every time she fell or leaned on the rope for support, <b>she</b> <b>hung</b> on the rope in her harness to gain more information about the climb. As she writes in her autobiography, [...] "In one moment I had, to some degree, thrown out years of climbing philosophy... The subtle advantage of hanging on the rope to figure out the crux moves gave me the added information that helped me learn and eventually succeed on the route. The old style of climbing suddenly seemed rigid, limited, and contrived." [...] That year, she performed a series of impressive feats, leading Tourist Treat on-sight with only one fall, [...] "perhaps the most difficult first ascent in the north country at the time". She was arguably [...] "the best climber in the Gunks", as local climbing legend Kevin Bein called her, and [...] "no man was climbing significantly better" [...] than her.|$|E
6000|$|... "She's some woman, that. <b>She's</b> <b>hung</b> on. <b>She</b> just wouldn't die, {{though she}} was pretty close to skin and bone all wrapped around a bit of fire when she went out with the sheep. Oh, she's thin now. Never will be fat. But it's the prettiest {{thinness}} I ever saw, and when I get back, and the trees begin to bear, and the kids get going to school, she and I {{are going to do}} Paris. I don't think much of that burg, but she's just hankered for it all her life." ...|$|R

2500|$|Maxine {{an unseen}} {{character}} was Janey's best friend from school. Although {{she was never}} seen, it was hinted that Maxine was very much like Janey: popular, and fashion-conscious. Janey once admitted to Susan that <b>she</b> <b>hung</b> out with Maxine because Maxine's alleged [...] "ugliness" [...] made Janey look more beautiful. Janey was also jealous that Maxine's parents treated her with expensive designer labels. It is unknown if they kept in touch.|$|E
2500|$|Following the 2008 elections, then President-elect Barack Obama rang Ros-Lehtinen {{to congratulate}} {{her on her}} re-election. <b>She</b> <b>hung</b> up on him, believing {{that it was a}} prank call from a radio station. [...] She did the same to Obama's chief of staff Rahm Emanuel when he rang to confirm the {{original}} call was genuine, and only accepted the call after Congressman Howard Berman managed to speak to her.|$|E
2500|$|Stephanie Leonidas as Helena Campbell, a young circus {{performer}} and aspiring artist who is {{drawn into a}} mysterious world of masked people and monsters shortly after her mother is hospitalized. It is eventually revealed that the world she entered was created through her own drawings that <b>she</b> <b>hung</b> up {{on the walls of}} her room. Leonidas stated that she expected that filming would be difficult because most of the scenes were done with one or two other actors just with a bluescreen in the background, but also said that [...] "it all came alive" [...] for them when they started working.|$|E

2500|$|The Jewish Encyclopedia lists a {{collection}} of other stories about Solomon and Pharaoh's daughter, saying she [...] "brought Solomon 1,000 different kinds of musical instruments, explaining to him that each of them {{was used in the}} worship of a special idol. <b>She</b> <b>hung</b> over his bed a canopy embroidered with gems which shone like stars; so that every time he intended to rise, he, on looking at the gems, thought it was still night. He continued to sleep, with the keys of the Temple under his pillow; and the priests therefore were unable to offer the morning sacrifice. They informed his mother, Bath-sheba, who roused the king when four hours of the day had flown. She then reprimanded him for his conduct; and the verses of Proverbs 31:1-9 are considered by the Rabbis as having been pronounced by Bathsheba on that occasion." ...|$|E
