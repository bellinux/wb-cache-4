5000|$|The {{idea of a}} body so massive {{that even}} light could not escape was briefly {{proposed}} by astronomical pioneer John Michell in a letter published in 1783-84. Michell's simplistic calculations assumed that such a body might have the same density as the Sun, and concluded that such a body would form when a star's diameter exceeds the Sun's {{by a factor of}} 500, and the surface escape velocity exceeds the usual speed of light. Michell correctly noted that such supermassive but non-radiating bodies might be detectable through their gravitational effects on nearby visible bodies. Scholars of the time were initially excited by the proposal that giant but invisible stars might be hiding in plain view, but enthusiasm dampened when the wavelike nature of light became apparent around the early nineteenth century. If light were a wave rather than a [...] "corpuscle", it became unclear what, if any, influence gravity would have on escaping light waves. In any case, thanks to modern relativity, we now know that Michell's picture of a light ray shooting directly out from the surface of a <b>supermassive</b> <b>star,</b> being slowed down by the star's gravity, stopping, and then free-falling back to the star's surface, is fundamentally incorrect.|$|E

Initial seed fields are provided via plasma fluctuations, and are subsequently amplified by the small-scale dynamo, leading to a strong tangled magnetic field. Here we explore how the magnetic field provided by the small-scale dynamo is further amplified via the α-Ω dynamo in a protostellar disk and assess its implications. For this purpose, we consider two characteristic cases, a typical Pop.

This problem is particularly challenging because of the vast dynamical range in space which must be covered in the course of collapse. We evolve a uniformly rotating <b>supermassive</b> <b>star</b> from the onset of radial instability at Rp/M = 411, where Rp is the proper polar radius of the star and M is the total mass-energy, to {{the point at which the}} post-Newtonian approximation breaks down.

Analytic estimates suggest that this should occur near Rp/M ∼ 12, at which point T/W ∼ 0. 27.

We find that corotating binaries are secularly unstable for close, circular orbits with r 4 R(M/ 10 ^ 6 M_) ^ 1 / 6 where r is the orbital separation and R the stellar radius. We also show that corotation cannot be achieved for distant orbits with r 12 R (M/ 10 ^ 6 M_) ^- 11 / 24, since the timescale for viscous angular momentum transfer associated with tidal torques is longer than the evolution timescale due to emission of thermal radiation.

The collapsing gas traps its own radiation and forms a radiation pressure-supported <b>supermassive</b> <b>star.</b> When {{the core of the}} <b>supermassive</b> <b>star</b> collapses, the resulting system becomes a quasi-star. We use a merger-tree approach to estimate the rate at which supermassive stars might form as a function of redshift, and the statistical properties of the resulting QS and seed black hole populations. We relate the triggering of runaway infall to major mergers of gas-rich galaxies and to a threshold for global gravitational instability, which we link to the angular momentum of the host. This is the main parameter of our models. Once infall is triggered, its rate is determined by the halo potential; the properties of the resulting <b>supermassive</b> <b>star,</b> QS and seed black hole depend on this rate. After the epoch of QSs, we model the growth of MBHs within their hosts in a merger-driven accretion scenario. We compare MBH seeds grown inside quasi-stars to a seed model that derives from the remnants of the first metal-free stars, and also study the case in which both channels of MBH formation operate simultaneously. We find that a limited range of supermassive star/QS/MBH formation efficiencies exists that allows one to reproduce observational constraints. Our models match the density of z = 6 quasars, the cumulative mass density accreted on to MBHs (according to Sołtan's argument) and the current mass density of MBHs.

Here we revisit the structure and evolution of rotationally-stabilized <b>supermassive</b> <b>stars,</b> taking into account their continuous accumulation of mass and their thermal relaxation. We show that the outer layers of <b>supermassive</b> <b>stars</b> are not thermally relaxed {{during much of the}} star's main sequence lifetime.

By matching the envelope solutions to convective cores, we calculate the core mass as a function of time.

The {{concept of}} central super-massive stars (M ≥ 5 × 10 4 M⊙, where M is {{the mass of}} the super-massive star) {{embedded}} in dense stellar systems was suggested as a possible explanation for high- energy emissions phenomena occurring in active galactic nuclei and quasars (Vilkoviski 1976, Hara 1978), such as X-ray emissions (Bahcall and Ostriker, 1975). SMSs and super-massive black holes are two possibilities to explain the nature of super-massive central objects, and <b>supermassive</b> <b>stars</b> may be an intermediate step towards the formation of super-massive black holes (Rees 1984).

40|$|Nonspherical stellar {{collapse}} to a {{black hole}} {{is one of the}} most promising gravitational wave sources for gravitational wave detectors. We numerically study gravitational waves from a slightly nonspherical stellar collapse {{to a black}} hole in linearized Einstein theory. We adopt a spherically collapsing star as the zeroth-order solution and gravitational waves are computed using perturbation theory on the spherical background. In this paper we focus on the perturbation of odd-parity modes. Using the polytropic equations of state with polytropic indices $n_p= 1 $ and 3, we qualitatively study gravitational waves emitted during the collapse of neutron <b>stars</b> and <b>supermassive</b> <b>stars</b> to black holes from a marginally stable equilibrium configuration. Since the matter perturbation profiles can be chosen arbitrarily, we provide a few types for them. For $n_p= 1 $, the gravitational waveforms are mainly characterized by a black hole quasinormal mode ringing, irrespective of perturbation profiles given initially. However, for $n_p= 3 $, the waveforms depend strongly on the initial perturbation profiles. In other words, the gravitational waveforms strongly depend on the stellar configuration and, in turn, on the ad hoc choice of the functional form of the perturbation in the case of <b>supermassive</b> <b>stars.</b> Comment: 31 pages, accepted for publication in Phys.

40|$|<b>Supermassive</b> {{primordial}} <b>stars</b> {{are suspected}} {{to be the}} progenitors of the most massive quasars at z~ 6. Previous studies of such stars were either unable to resolve hydrodynamical timescales or considered stars in isolation, not in the extreme accretion flows in which they actually form. Therefore, they could not self-consistently predict their final masses at collapse, or those of the resulting supermassive black hole seeds, but rather invoked comparison to simple polytropic models. Here, we systematically examine the birth, evolution and collapse of accreting non-rotating <b>supermassive</b> <b>stars</b> under accretion rates of 0. 01 - 10 solar masses per year, using the stellar evolution code KEPLER. Our approach includes post-Newtonian corrections to the stellar structure and an adaptive nuclear network, and can transition to following the hydrodynamic evolution of <b>supermassive</b> <b>stars</b> after they encounter the general relativistic instability. We find that this instability triggers {{the collapse of the}} star at masses of 150, 000 - 330, 000 solar masses for accretion rates of 0. 1 - 10 solar masses per year, and that the final mass of the star scales roughly logarithmically with the rate. The structure of the star, and thus its stability against collapse, is sensitive to the treatment of convection, and the heat content of the outer accreted envelope. Comparison with other codes suggests differences here may lead to small deviations in the evolutionary state of the star as a function of time, that worsen with accretion rate. Since the general relativistic instability leads to the immediate death of these stars, our models place an upper limit on the masses of the first quasars at birth. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures.

40|$|We {{present a}} model to explain {{the wide range of}} abundances for heavy r-process {{elements}} (mass number A > 130) at low [Fe/H]. This model requires rapid star formation and/or an initial population of <b>supermassive</b> <b>stars</b> in the earliest condensed clots of matter in order to provide a prompt or initial Fe inventory. Subsequent Fe and r-process enrichment was provided by two types of supernovae: one producing heavy r-elements with no Fe on a rather short timescale and the other producing light r-elements (A ≤ 130) with Fe on a much longer timescale...|$|R
