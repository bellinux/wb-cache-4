500|$|Motley {{and fellow}} black {{teammate}} Bill Willis contended with racism throughout their careers. Although the color barrier was broken in all major American sports by 1950, the men endured shouted insults {{on the field}} and racial discrimination off of it. [...] "They found out that while they were calling us niggers and alligator bait, I was running for touchdowns and Willis was knocking the <b>shit</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> them," [...] Motley once said. [...] "So they stopped calling us names and started trying to catch up with us." [...] Focused exclusively on winning, Brown did not tolerate racism within the team.|$|E
500|$|Del Toro {{acknowledged}} this message's simplicity, {{but said}} {{he would have liked to}} have seen adventure films with similar morals when he was a child. The film's ten primary characters all have [...] "little arcs" [...] conducive to this idea; del Toro stated: [...] "I think that's a great message to give kids… 'That guy you were beating the <b>shit</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> ten minutes ago? That's the guy you have to work with five minutes later.' That's life… We can only be complete when we work together." [...] The director noted that Hellboy and The Devil's Backbone told the same message, though the latter conveyed it in a very different way.|$|E

In 2008 he called it [...] "infuriating and idiotic" [...] that two gay {{partners}} [...] "have {{to go through this}} fucking dog and pony act when they stop at a hotel and the guy behind the counter says, 'You want one room or two?'" [...] He went on to say, [...] "I'm incredibly passionate about my support for the gay community and what they're dealing with at this current point in time". MacFarlane continued, [...] "Why is it that Johnny Spaghetti Stain in fucking Georgia can knock a woman up, legally be married to her, and then beat the <b>shit</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her, but these two intelligent, sophisticated writers who have been together for 20 years can't get married?" ...|$|E

5000|$|Thom {{has been}} the subject of {{criticism}} by many artists within the recording world, most notably from Lily Allen, The Fratellis and The Automatic. James Frost and Robin Hawkins from The Automatic stated that [...] "If she was a punk rocker with flowers in her hair she'd get the <b>shit</b> kicked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her by other punk rockers, for having flowers in her hair. ... I haven't found anyone who's told me they like that song and bought it." [...] Charlie Brooker also heavily criticised the intense public relations efforts to make the single popular.|$|R
500|$|Pretty on the Inside {{has had an}} {{influence}} on multiple alternative rock acts, being specifically mentioned by Spinnerette frontwoman Brody Dalle in an interview as a seminal album {{in the development of}} her music. British rock band Nine Black Alps also noted the album as a major influence on their third release, Locked Out from the Inside (2009), and indie singer-songwriter Scout Niblett cited it as a major influence on her: [...] "For me, the thing that I loved about them and her [...] was the anger, and aggressiveness, along with the tender side", said Niblett. [...] "That was something I hadn't seen before in a woman playing music. That was hugely influential and really inspiring. Women up 'til then were kind of one-dimensional, twee, sweet, ethereal, and that annoys the <b>shit</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> me." ...|$|E
500|$|Although The Marble Index was {{generally}} unnoticed {{when it was}} released, it was praised by the countercultural East Village Other and International Times; however, most critics found [...] "her desolate soundscapes inaccessible." [...] Anne Marie Micklo of Rolling Stone gave the album a positive review, calling side two [...] "a really worthwhile venture into musical infinity". A cult following emerged around it, which included music journalist Lester Bangs, who wrote in a 1978 article entitled [...] "Your Shadow Is Scared of You: An Attempt Not to Be Frightened by Nico": [...] "The Marble Index is the greatest piece of 'avant-garde classical', 'serious' music of {{the last half of}} the 20th century so far."

At first, it was a grind trying to get booked in a DJ-centric world, but the duo's DIY Come Unity events at the Bryant Street pad (the first event was a rent party) were a hit, and soon Dubtribe was making records.|$|R
500|$|The period {{following}} Enema of the State saw {{the band}} experience great transition. [...] "We {{had gone from}} playing small clubs and sleeping on people's floors to headlining amphitheaters and staying in five-star hotels," [...] recalled Hoppus in 2013. [...] "After years of hard work, promotion, and nonstop touring, people knew who we were, and listened to what we were saying... it scared the <b>shit</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> us." [...] The band was rushed into recording the follow-up, as according to DeLonge, [...] "the president of MCA was penalizing us an obscene amount of money because our record wasn't {{going to be out}} in time for them to make their quarterly revenue statements. [...] And we were saying, 'Hey, we can't do this right now, we need to reorganize ourselves and really think about {{what we want to do}} and write the best record we can.' They didn't agree with us." ...|$|E

In a 2004 interview, the Edge said that Bono [...] "scared the <b>shit</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> [...] " [...] by climbing onto the rig and risking electrocution by the live wires in close proximity. Bono said [...] "good night" [...] to the crowd on nearly {{a half a dozen}} occasions so that the post-production crew would have several choices of songs with which to end the film. Backstage, the band members were disappointed that the crowd did not initially chant [...] "how long to sing this song?" [...] after the band had left the stage following the final song, [...] "40", which had become a tradition. However, tour manager Dennis Sheehan hid underneath the crowd barrier and began singing the refrain into a microphone without being asked. Eventually, the crowd joined in; the film was edited to disguise the fact that the singing was organised.|$|E
500|$|... "Laser Beam" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Tetsuo Hiraga from Hot Express was positive in his review, complimenting its composition and commercial appeal. Asian Junkie editor Random J reviewed the song {{on his personal}} blog, and was positive; he stated, [...] "...the new melodic additions put a cool spin on the song. Yasutaka chops and stutters the absolute <b>shit</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the post chorus sections {{in a way which}} cements his position {{as one of the best}} knob twiddlers in the music biz right now. [...] "Laser Beam" [...] was a great song in May. It's still great now." [...] He identified it as an album highlight, and the album's best track. Ian Martin from The Japan Times was favorable in his review, stating, [...] "The chorus... of [...] "Laser Beam" [...] are great examples of classic Japanese pop, taking the sounds of 1970s kayōkyoku and 1980s technopop and updating them in a way that manages to be at once nostalgic and defiantly modern."

After gauging local market interest he imported 20 of them.“They were <b>shit...</b> two <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the 20 weren’t working at all” Peter recalled in an interview. “I opened them up, and saw they’d used inferior components and the soldered joints were bad.

5000|$|The first {{recordings}} of the new and improved Turbonegro were the Denim Demon and Bad Mongo singles {{in the spring of}} 1995. That summer, Turbonegro left for their second attempt at a U.S. tour, [...] "Namblin in the 90's". They played only 11 shows. In the words of Happy-Tom, [...] "at least we didn't get the <b>shit</b> kicked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> us like we did the last time we were in the USA". In the fall of 1995, Bingo and Pål left the band, putting Turbonegro on hold. Pål wanted to travel, while Bingo didn't like the new musical direction ("less Slayer, more rock'n'roll.") Happy-Tom, at the same time, was suffering from stress injuries to his arms after the U.S. tour. Therefore, agreements were made to put the band on hold for a while.|$|R
500|$|Hordern was a self-confessed [...] "lazy bugger" [...] {{when it came}} to role preparation. He did not regret {{his lack}} of formal acting training, and {{attributed}} his abilities to watching and learning from other actors and directors. He said: [...] "I am bored of the intellectual view of the theatre. Actually, it scares the <b>shit</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> me, my view being that an actor should learn the lines without too much cerebral interference." [...] In 1951, he asked Byam Shaw how best to rehearse unfamiliar roles. [...] The director advised him to [...] "never read up on them" [...] before going on to say [...] "read the plays as much as [...] but never read the commentators or critics". It was advice which Hordern adopted for the role of King Lear, {{and for the rest of}} his career. The critic Brian McFarlane, writing for the British Film Institute, said that Hordern, despite his relaxed attitude, [...] "had one of the most productive careers of any 20th century British actor".|$|E
500|$|At age 10, Ryder and {{her family}} moved on again, this time to Petaluma, California. During her first week at Kenilworth Junior High, she was bullied {{by a group of}} her peers who mistook her for an effeminate, scrawny boy. [...] "I was wearing an old Salvation Army shop boy’s suit. As I went to the {{bathroom}} I heard people saying, ‘Hey, faggot’. They slammed my head into a locker. I fell to the ground and they started to kick the <b>shit</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> me. I had to have stitches. The school kicked me out, not the bullies... Years later, I went to a coffee shop and I ran into one of the girls who’d kicked me, and she said, ‘Winona, Winona, can I have your autograph?’ And I said, ‘Do you remember me? Remember in seventh grade you beat up that kid?’ And she said, ‘Kind of’. And I said, ‘That was me. Go fuck yourself.’" [...] As a result, Ryder ended up being home-schooled that year.|$|E
500|$|In {{their second}} game, the Browns faced the Chicago Rockets at Soldier Field before {{a crowd of}} 51,962 people, an {{attendance}} record for a professional football game in Chicago. It {{was the first of}} many games during which Cleveland's two black players, Marion Motley and Bill Willis, endured racially charged verbal and physical abuse. Some of their white teammates, including Lou Rymkus, retaliated by dealing their own cheap shots. Motley opened the scoring with a 20-yard run for a touchdown, the first in his career. Lou Groza added two field goals in the third quarter, and halfback Don Greenwood ran for a 41-yard touchdown to make the final score 20–6. Chicago's only points came on a touchdown run by Billy Hillenbrand on the first play of the fourth quarter. Motley later said that racism on the field stopped after opponents saw how well he and Willis played: [...] "They found out that while they were calling us niggers and alligator bait, I was running for touchdowns and Willis was knocking the <b>shit</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> them. So they stopped calling us names and started trying to catch up with us." ...|$|E

On March 19, 2005, he had one more K-1 bout against Remy Bonjasky, to whom he lost via verbal submission, the first and only strike of the night, a head kick, would land on the square on the head of Mercer.

He successfully defended his crown by stopping Gregorio Peralta of Argentina on a TKO, and by coming back from a certain defeat on points to KO English challenger Terry Downes in 11 rounds in Manchester, England. Pastrano lost his crown when he was TKOed by José Torres in 10 rounds (the same fight where the ringside doctor asked if he knew where he was, leading to Pastrano's legendary line of [...] "You're damn right I know where I am! I'm in Madison Square Garden getting the <b>shit</b> kicked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> me!").

500|$|On Frohman's arrival, Ravenholm is {{depicted}} as a peaceful, bright, and cheerful place devoid of any Combine elements, but [...] "terrorized" [...] by Father Grigori. After adjusting, Gordon becomes accustomed to the town, but unintentionally discloses the town's location to Dr. Breen, who immediately orders his forces to [...] "bomb the <b>shit</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> them". The town is fired on with headcrabs, killing many and turning others into zombies. Frohman himself is attacked by a headcrab and turns into a zombie too, yet retains his free will; {{and after a while}} his headcrab dies of malnutrition, which is attributed to his lack of intelligence. With Father Grigori's help, Frohman escapes Ravenholm, now the zombie-infested nightmare seen when Freeman visits it in the game, and presses on to Nova Prospekt. After surviving several more hazards, he reaches the coast. Here, after passing the final resistance base and an Antlion-infested beach, Frohman encounters an Antlion Guard, which is killed by a Vortigaunt, an alien race helping the humans in the game. This allows Frohman to retrieve bugbait from the dead creature, with which he can control the Antlions.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was divided, as reviews ranged from largely positive to negative. In the book The End and the Beginning: The Official Guide to The X-Files, Vol. 5, author Andy Meisler {{noted that some}} fans and critics responded positively to [...] "The Beginning," [...] most notably because the episode functioned as [...] "a particularly artful and effective way to launch the series's new season—and era." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files wrote positively of the episode, saying [...] "'The Beginning' {{was a pretty good}} premiere episode. I was quite pleased to see how Chris Carter took last season's finale and the movie and tied things together to get Season 6 off to a fresh start." [...] Todd VanDerWerff from The A.V. Club gave it a B. He praised the performance of Chris Owens, noting that he was [...] "acting the <b>shit</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Spender". Despite this, however he called the episode [...] "lackluster" [...] and noted that it [...] "isn’t a great episode of the show, but it works well enough". VanDerWerff's main issue with the entry was that it chose to close off the events of the fifth season finale, but did little to expand upon the revelations of the series' feature film. VanDerWerff also criticized the fact that Scully was, once again, a skeptic in the paranormal after all she saw.|$|E
500|$|... "One Wonderful Day" [...] also {{introduced}} the second-season mystery surrounding Betty Applewhite (Alfre Woodard) and Matthew Applewhite (Mehcad Brooks). Cherry revealed, [...] "they {{come on the}} street; they seem like nice people — but they've got a secret. And it's pretty gothic. It's real and human and awful {{all at the same}} time." [...] Another scene featuring the Applewhite family, in which Betty brings food to a prisoner in their basement, was cut from this episode but was used in the second season premiere, [...] "Next". Cherry's inspiration for the Lynette storyline came from his own childhood experience when his mother returned to work. He commented: [...] "The predicament of any working woman is that you can love your career, but there is something... to be said for getting to stay home every day with your kids, and you don't want anyone else to be better at it than you are. Felicity Huffman expressed satisfaction with how her storyline was handled, explaining that Lynette [...] "didn't deal with [...] in the most straightforward way, but she was fighting for her family. They were noble motives." [...] While discussing the courtroom scene in which Carlos attacks John, Ricardo Antonio Chavira commented: [...] "People can see the full rage that is in my character. I'm yelling at him, 'I'm gonna kill you'... Then I broke into Spanish: [...] "Yo voy a matar!"... I just went for it... Then I looked, and Jesse [...] had the most honest look of sheer terror.

[...] David Jeffries of AllMusic praised the album for containing tracks that exude the same energy that [...] "Gas Pedal" [...] did, {{calling it a}} very good party album and praising Sage for being [...] "a great host, juggling familiar and fun with ease." [...] Craig Jenkins of Pitchfork Media praised Sage's production and vocal delivery for carrying a lot charm into the tracks, concluding that the album [...] "keeps its mood light and its stakes low, {{and in the process}} delivers a much needed breezy counterpoint to all the knotty, fatalistic <b>shit</b> coming <b>out</b> <b>of</b> HBK’s downstate peers that’s every bit as true to Cali as the gangsters and the thinkers." ...|$|R
2500|$|The lyrics on Tormented are {{influenced}} by Staind frontman Aaron Lewis' life. Lewis spoke about it, saying: [...] "My life, {{up to a point}} was shit. But I've come a long way. I grew up in a trailer park in Vermont. That was the <b>shit</b> I got <b>out</b> <b>of</b> me in Tormented and Dysfunction, and tailing into Break the Cycle. But the title, Break the Cycle, says it all." [...] AllMusic described Tormented as [...] "grittier and more raw than" [...] Staind's [...] "subsequent releases".

I’d Google “How to break <b>out</b> <b>of</b> prison.” So, that’s exactly what I did. I went on and Googled “How to break <b>out</b> <b>of</b> prison,” “How to break into a car,” and found these fascinating things, and I just used them. I figured that’s what he would do. I also knew I would fail spectacularly, at least at first. But then I would continue.

I’d start to feel really good about myself, that I’d figured the whole thing out, and then something would go wrong. I would just keep going until I either was caught or we got out or something happened. That’s what he does. So, I just tried to make him an everyman. I loved {{the fact that this}} guy was also an English teacher, so he was a romantic. He was talking about Don Quixote. He’s got this whole romanticized vision of how you sacrifice yourself for a woman, how you go about something like this. It’s terribly romanticized and so completely impractical.|$|R
500|$|American pressmen {{had been}} alerted to an {{upcoming}} Buddhist demonstration {{to coincide with}} Double Seven Day at Chanatareansey Pagoda {{in the north of}} Saigon. The group, which included Arnett, Browne, David Halberstam, Neil Sheehan of United Press International, and CBS's Peter Kalischer waited outside the building with their equipment. After an hour-long religious ceremony, the Buddhists filed out of the pagoda into a narrow alley along a side street, where they were blocked and ordered to stop by plain-clothed policemen. The Buddhists did not resist, but Arnett and Browne began taking photos of the confrontation. The police, who were loyal to Ngô Đình Nhu, thereupon punched Arnett in the nose, knocked him to the ground, kicked him with their pointed-toe shoes, and broke his camera. Halberstam, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the Buddhist crisis, was a tall man, standing around [...] taller than the average Vietnamese policeman.

The police smashed Browne's camera, but his photographic film survived the impact. The other journalists were jostled and rocks were thrown at them. Photos of Arnett's bloodied face were circulated in US newspapers and caused further ill-feeling towards Diệm's regime, with the images of the burning Thích Quảng Đức on the front pages still fresh {{in the minds of the}} public.|$|E

In frigid conditions at Yankee Stadium, Taylor carried 31 times for 85yards and scored the Packers' only touchdown against what was considered the league's best defense, both statistically and by reputation. Lombardi entrusted Taylor with the ball, as he was confident his fullback {{would be able to}} move the offense and not turn it over. The game was highlighted by the fierce rivalry between Taylor and Giants linebacker Sam Huff. The two clashed on nearly every play and engaged in trash talk throughout the game. Steve Sabol, who filmed the game with his father for NFL Films, described it as such:The lasting image of that game in my mind is the ferocity and anger of Jim Taylor ... his barely restrained rage as he ran with the ball. Taylor just got the <b>shit</b> kicked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> him all day long ... There was all this trash-talking between him and especially Sam Huff ... Tons of profanity when they tackled him.
