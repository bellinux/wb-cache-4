5|$|In 1917, at {{the height}} of his work on relativity, Einstein {{published}} an article in Physikalische Zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of <b>stimulated</b> <b>emission,</b> the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser.|$|E
5|$|In 1918, Einstein {{developed}} a {{general theory of}} {{the process by which}} atoms emit and absorb electromagnetic radiation (his A and B coefficients), which is the basis of lasers (<b>stimulated</b> <b>emission)</b> and shaped the development of modern quantum electrodynamics, the best-validated physical theory at present.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, a {{group of}} {{researchers}} at Bell Laboratories discovered laser action in xenon, and later found that the laser gain was improved by adding helium to the lasing medium. The first excimer laser used a xenon dimer (Xe2) energized by a beam of electrons to produce <b>stimulated</b> <b>emission</b> at an ultraviolet wavelength of 176 nm.|$|E
40|$|Unknown {{wireless}} {{devices that}} use receiver architectures with a mixer may be detected and located using <b>stimulated</b> <b>emissions.</b> Transmitting a known stimulation signal and correlating leaked mixer products allows {{measurement of the}} TOF and thus range. The FRFT improves the detection of the <b>stimulated</b> <b>emissions</b> by compressing {{the energy of the}} <b>stimulated</b> <b>emissions</b> to a single axis value. The stimulation signal has many parameters that may be optimized for maximum detection distance or minimum range error or somewhere in between. The primary limiting factor for the parameters is the processing time, as the algorithm to compute the discrete FRFT is computationally intensive {{at the time of this}} report. The tests performed in this investigation achieved 45 +meters detection distance with < 3 meters of range error, with potential for farther detection distance. ...|$|R
40|$|By {{means of}} an energy {{conservation}} approach, this paper analyzes the growth rates of whistlers with arbitrary frequency and direction of propagation in a cold plasma permeated by a dilute energetic electron population. Numerical results are obtained for whistler frequencies and plasma characteristics prevailing {{at the onset of}} artificially <b>stimulated</b> <b>emissions.</b> It is found that the growth rates do not in general maximize for propagation along the static magnetic field, and a criterion for the existence of maximal growth at this direction is derived. An application to artificially <b>stimulated</b> <b>emissions</b> is discussed...|$|R

5|$|Photons {{have many}} {{applications}} in technology. These examples are chosen to illustrate applications of photons per se, rather than general optical {{devices such as}} lenses, etc. that could operate under a classical theory of light. The laser is an extremely important application and is discussed above under <b>stimulated</b> <b>emission.</b>|$|E
5|$|As an even-numbered lanthanide, in {{accordance}} with the Oddo-Harkins rule, ytterbium is significantly more abundant than its immediate neighbors, thulium and lutetium, which occur in the same concentrate at levels of about 0.5% each. The world production of ytterbium is only about 50 tonnes per year, reflecting that it has few commercial applications. Microscopic traces of ytterbium are used as a dopant in the , a solid-state laser in which ytterbium is the element that undergoes <b>stimulated</b> <b>emission</b> of electromagnetic radiation.|$|E
5|$|Natural rubies are {{corundum}} (aluminum oxide) crystals {{that are}} colored red (the rarest type) due to chromium (III) ions (other colors of corundum gems are termed sapphires). A red-colored artificial ruby {{may also be}} achieved by doping chromium(III) into artificial corundum crystals, thus making chromium a requirement for making synthetic rubies. Such a synthetic ruby crystal {{was the basis for}} the first laser, produced in 1960, which relied on <b>stimulated</b> <b>emission</b> of light from the chromium atoms in such a crystal.|$|E
40|$|The {{measurements}} of both spontaneous and <b>stimulated</b> <b>emissions</b> of radiation {{in the newly}} configured Israeli EA-FEL are made for the first time. The radiation at the W-band was measured and characterized. The results match the predictions of our earlier theoretical modeling and calculations.

50|$|In 1951, Joseph Weber {{submitted}} {{a paper on}} using <b>stimulated</b> <b>emissions</b> to make a microwave amplifier to the June 1952 Institute of Radio Engineers Vacuum Tube Research Conference at Ottawa. After this presentation, RCA asked Weber to give a seminar on this idea, and Charles Hard Townes asked him {{for a copy of}} the paper.|$|R
40|$|Linear and {{nonlinear}} propagating {{characteristics of}} right-hand polarized, slow electromagnetic, magnetoplasma waves (whistlers) {{are discussed in}} terms of stability and dispersion. An analysis of the stability of whistlers propagating at an angle to the static magnetic field is presented. A new mechanism is derived for the onset of <b>stimulated</b> <b>emissions,</b> and modulational instability for nonlinear whistlers are discussed...|$|R
5|$|If a bound {{electron}} {{is in an}} excited state, an interacting photon with the proper energy can cause <b>stimulated</b> <b>emission</b> of a photon with a matching energy level. For this to occur, the electron must drop to a lower energy state that has an energy difference matching {{the energy of the}} interacting photon. The emitted photon and the interacting photon then move off in parallel and with matching phases. That is, the wave patterns of the two photons are synchronized. This physical property is used to make lasers, which can emit a coherent beam of light energy in a narrow frequency band.|$|E
25|$|The rate {{at which}} <b>stimulated</b> <b>emission</b> occurs is {{proportional}} to the number of atoms N2 in the excited state, and the radiation density of the light. The base probability of a photon causing <b>stimulated</b> <b>emission</b> in a single excited atom was shown by Albert Einstein to be exactly equal to the probability of a photon being absorbed by an atom in the ground state. Therefore, when the numbers of atoms in the ground and excited states are equal, the rate of <b>stimulated</b> <b>emission</b> is equal to the rate of absorption for a given radiation density.|$|E
25|$|<b>Stimulated</b> <b>emission</b> {{was first}} {{observed}} in the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum, giving rise to the acronym MASER for Microwave Amplification by <b>Stimulated</b> <b>Emission</b> of Radiation. In the microwave region, the Boltzmann distribution of molecules among energy states is such that, at room temperature all states are populated almost equally.|$|E

40|$|The {{femtosecond}} time-resolved fluorescence depletion {{method has}} been introduced. In this method two beams of femtosecond laser was used. One excited the sample molecular to emit fluorescence.

25|$|Lacking a {{feedback}} mechanism, laser amplifiers and superluminescent sources also function on {{the basis}} of <b>stimulated</b> <b>emission.</b>|$|E
25|$|For their {{research}} in the field of <b>stimulated</b> <b>emission,</b> Townes, Basov and Prokhorov were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1964.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the observation of}} <b>stimulated</b> <b>emissions</b> by current injections into a silicon quantum well. The device consists of a free standing membrane with a distributed feedback resonant cavity fabricated by state-of-the-art silicon processes. The emission spectra have multimode structures peaked in the near-infrared region above the submilliampere threshold currents at room temperatures. Consequently, electronics and photonics {{should be able to}} be converged on chips by using silicon quantum well laser diodes...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a population inversion in a three-level system via three-photon absorption {{from a single}} shaped ultrafast laser pulse. The optimal pulse shape for the inversion is discovered using closed-loop learning control and interpreted via pulse shape parameter scans and numerical integration of the Schr 6 dinger equation. The population inversion is measured {{using a combination of}} spontaneous and <b>stimulated</b> <b>emissions.</b> Our results illustrate the importance of dynamic Stark shifts in coherent multi-photon excitation.

50|$|If {{the higher}} energy {{state has a}} greater {{population}} than the lower energy state (N1 < N2), then the emission process dominates, and light in the system undergoes a net increase in intensity. It is thus clear that to produce a faster rate of <b>stimulated</b> <b>emissions</b> than absorptions, it is required that {{the ratio of the}} populations of the two states is such thatN2/N1 > 1; In other words, a population inversion is required for laser operation.|$|R
25|$|A laser is {{a device}} that emits light (electromagnetic radiation) through a process called <b>stimulated</b> <b>emission.</b> The term laser is an acronym for Light Amplification by <b>Stimulated</b> <b>Emission</b> of Radiation. Laser light is usually {{spatially}} coherent, {{which means that the}} light either is emitted in a narrow, low-divergence beam, or can be converted into one with the help of optical components such as lenses. Because the microwave equivalent of the laser, the maser, was developed first, devices that emit microwave and radio frequencies are usually called masers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Stimulated</b> <b>emission</b> {{is one of}} the {{fundamental}} processes that {{led to the development of}} the laser. Laser radiation is, however, very far from the present case of isotropic radiation.|$|E
25|$|The {{process is}} {{identical}} in form to atomic absorption {{in which the}} energy of an absorbed photon causes an identical but opposite atomic transition: from the lower level to a higher energy level. In normal media at thermal equilibrium, absorption exceeds <b>stimulated</b> <b>emission</b> because there are more electrons in the lower energy states than in the higher energy states. However, when a population inversion is present, the rate of <b>stimulated</b> <b>emission</b> exceeds that of absorption, and a net optical amplification can be achieved. Such a gain medium, along with an optical resonator, {{is at the heart}} of a laser or maser.|$|E
40|$|We exploit {{inter-layer}} radiative {{transitions to}} provide gains to amplify terahertz waves in graphene heterostructures. This {{is achieved by}} properly doping graphene sheets and aligning their energy bands so that the processes of <b>stimulated</b> <b>emissions</b> can overwhelm absorptions. We derive an expression for the gain estimation and show the gain is insensitive to temperature variation. Moreover, the gain is broadband and can {{be strong enough to}} compensate the free carrier loss, indicating graphene based room temperature terahertz lasers are feasible...|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss a}} {{possible}} principle for detecting dark matter axions in galactic halos. If axions constitute a condensate in the Milky Way, <b>stimulated</b> <b>emissions</b> of the axions from {{a type of}} excitation in condensed matter can be detectable. We provide general mechanism for the dark matter emission, and, as a concrete example, an emission of dark matter axions from magnetic vortex strings in a type II superconductor are investigated along with possible experimental signatures.

25|$|<b>Stimulated</b> <b>emission</b> can be {{modelled}} mathematically {{by considering}} an atom {{that may be}} {{in one of two}} electronic energy states, a lower level state (possibly the ground state) (1) and an excited state (2), with energies E1 and E2 respectively.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, if the excited-state atom is perturbed by an {{electric}} field of frequency ν0, it may emit an additional photon {{of the same}} frequency and in phase, thus augmenting the external field, leaving the atom in the lower energy state. This process is known as <b>stimulated</b> <b>emission.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Stimulated</b> <b>emission</b> {{from the}} N-V− center has been demonstrated, {{though it could}} be {{achieved}} only from the phonon side-band (i.e. broadband light) and not from the ZPL. For this purpose the center has to be excited at wavelength longer than ~650nm, as higher-energy excitation ionizes the center.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively, one {{can save}} the photon concept by recalling that the laser field is very strong and the pulse is very short. Indeed, the {{electric}} field in the laser pulse {{is so strong that}} during the process depicted in Fig. 3 about a hundred of photon absorptions and <b>stimulated</b> <b>emissions</b> can take place. And since the pulse is short, it has sufficiently wide bandwidth to accommodate absorption of photons that are more energetic than the re-emitted ones, giving the net result of a fraction of ħω. Effectively, we have a kind of dynamic Raman effect.|$|R
