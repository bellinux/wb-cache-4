30|$|This data is {{segmented}} {{by means}} of seaborne transport (import and export) and interactions between the following geographic activity areas: Middle East, Europe, America, Asia (Far East), Asia ISC (Indian sub-continent), Asia Arab and Africa, according to the policy segmentation of Lloyd’s Marine Intelligence Unit (LMIU). This allows us to receive annual data such as: total borne ton in each area (Mt), a segmentation of the total ton transported {{by means of}} <b>sea</b> <b>freight</b> transportation in each area (Mt) and interactions between areas by the borne ton (Mt) along with segmentation by means of <b>sea</b> <b>freight</b> transportation (Mt). Due {{to the fact that}} the nominal data for borne ton at this moment is not relevant, we will continue to process the data by percentage. Using the total seaborne tons in a given year will serve as a reference for an annual allocation. We will perform the segmentation of the seaborne tons by means of <b>sea</b> <b>freight</b> transportation (%), interactions between areas (%) by sea borne tons. The results of this action will grant us ten tables (one for each year - 1997 – 2007) of sea borne ton relations (%), segments by area (%), means of <b>sea</b> <b>freight</b> transportation (%) and interactions between areas (%).|$|R
30|$|One could suggest {{in order}} to limit {{reduction}} costs, these costs should be calculated according to the borne ton criteria. This {{has the potential to}} lead to a selective “loading” of the reduction costs on the shipper, for example: <b>sea</b> <b>freight</b> of electronic goods (i.e., - computers and technology equipment) in container vessels are considered lightweight freight, but highly valuable. An attempt to implement calculation according to borne ton criteria could lead to higher payment request from the shipper in correlation to a similar <b>sea</b> <b>freight</b> of less valuable merchandise, reducing the consumer’s surplus furthermore.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Cargo {{transportation}} {{is a very}} serious business and cost of delivering a pound of cargo for a mile keeps rising every day. Today, there are two options exist; fast but expensive aircraft and slow but inexpensive <b>sea</b> <b>freight.</b> A Hybrid Air Vehicle (HAV) was designed to solve this problem by combining the aerodynamic lift advantages from a lifting body shape and the effectiveness of lighter than air from buoyancy. These combined lifting capabilities gave the HAV enough lifting force to carry additional cargo compared to aircraft and its propeller engine gave it the ability to travel relatively fast compared to <b>sea</b> <b>freight.</b> The cost of transporting a pound of cargo a mile using proposed HAV is $ 0. 00022 /lb-mile as compared to $ 0. 00043 /lb-mile for C- 5 Galaxy which translates to nearly 48 % saving. The HAV cost 1000 % more than <b>sea</b> <b>freight</b> but it is 647 % faster...|$|R

30|$|To conclude, {{the purpose}} of this {{research}} is to generate an economic estimation of the maritime shipping impact on the environment, specifically focusing on the main GHG emissions (carbon) resulting from shipping activity. The goals of this research, as defined, dealt with the current <b>sea</b> <b>freight</b> tariff, considered a practical tariff that does not reflect the real social cost of <b>sea</b> <b>freight.</b> In this study we examined and attempted to identify the economic potential reduction rate that will ensure cost effective reduction while maintaining economic growth. We did so by implementing the METS mechanism and found its potential effectiveness.|$|R
