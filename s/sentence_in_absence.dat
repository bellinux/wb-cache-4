Most of these persons were kidnapped before their deaths. Gaviria, Echeverri and Araújo were killed by shots in the head when Colombian military forces stormed the camps where they were held by guerrilla insurgents. He was also found responsible for bombing Club El Nogal in Bogotá where 36 people were killed. The Government of Paraguay had asked for his extradition for his participation in the kidnapping and death of Cecilia Cubas, daughter of the ex-president of Paraguay, who was kidnapped on September 21, 2004 and whose body was found in an abandoned house in February 2005.

On the basis of the commission's findings many officers were discharged, quite a few of them dishonourably. In several instances court martial proceedings were also undertaken. Some of the accused were sentenced to imprisonment, while Colonel von Ingersleben, commandant of the fortress of Küstrin, and General von Kleist as Governor of Magdeburg, were condemned to death.

Otherwise, diacritics appear either only on homographic words when not disambiguated by surrounding text or on all words as in religious or educational texts. In an eye tracking experiment we examined <b>sentence</b> processing <b>in</b> the <b>absence</b> of diacritics, and when diacritics {{were presented in}} either modes. Heterophonic-homographic target verbs that have different pronunciations in active and passive (e. g., برض /daraba/, hit; برض /doriba/, was hit) were embedded <b>in</b> temporarily ambiguous <b>sentences</b> where <b>in</b> the <b>absence</b> of diacritics, readers cannot be certain whether the verb was active or passive. Passive sentences were disambiguated by an extra word (e. g., ديب /bijad/, by the hand of). Our results show that readers processed the disambiguating diacritics when present only on the homographic verb. When disambiguating diacritics were absent, Arabic readers followed their parsing preference for active verb analysis, and garden path effects were observed. When reading fully diacritised sentences, readers incurred only a small cost, likely due to increased visual crowding, but did not extensively process the (mostly superfluous) diacritics, thus resulting in a lack of benefit from the disambiguating diacritics on the passive verb...|$|R

40|$|We {{report the}} results of {{experiments}} designed to investigate the effects of prosodic boundaries on resolving ambiguous syntactic clause boundaries in Japanese. The head-final, pro-drop nature of this language generates abundant syntactic attachment ambiguity for sentences that contain relative clauses. Two types of sentences with differing head nouns modified by relative clauses were examined. Syntactic attachment preferences for {{these two types of}} <b>sentences</b> <b>in</b> the <b>absence</b> of overt prosody were assessed in a written study. Results indicated that readers retrieved one clear meaning for one type whereas ambiguity was not clearly resolved for the other type. A sentence comprehension study was conducted using auditory versions of both sentence types, each produced with two prosodic structures. Results demonstrated the crucial use of prosodic boundary information in retrieving syntactic clause boundary information. Most importantly, prosodic boundaries affected the way listeners posited empty pronouns for the subject of main or subordinate predicates. These results demonstrated the fundamental importance of prosodic phrasal structure to the assignment of syntactic constituency during <b>sentence</b> comprehension, particularly <b>in</b> the case of a head-final, pro-drop language. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{present study}} was aimed at {{investigating}} the writing parameters of writer's cramp patients and control subjects during handwriting of a test <b>sentence</b> <b>in</b> the <b>absence</b> of visual control. Methods Eight right-handed patients with writer's cramp and eight healthy volunteers as age-matched control subjects participated in the study. The experimental task consisted in writing a test sentence repeatedly for fifty times on a pressure-sensitive digital board. The subject did not have visual control on his handwriting. The writing performance was stored on a PC and analyzed off-line. Results During handwriting all patients developed a typical dystonic limb posture and reported an increase in muscular tension along the experimental session. The patients were significantly slower than the controls, with lower mean vertical pressure of the pen tip on the paper and they could not reach the endmost letter of the <b>sentence</b> <b>in</b> the given time window. No other handwriting parameter {{differences were found between}} the two groups. Conclusion Our findings indicate that during writing <b>in</b> the <b>absence</b> of visual feedback writer's cramp patients are slower and could not reach the endmost letter of the test sentence, but their level of automatization is not impaired and writer's cramp handwriting parameters are similar to those of the controls except for even lower vertical pressure of the pen tip on the paper, which is probably due to a changed strategy in such experimental conditions. </p...|$|R
40|$|The study {{presents}} a brief political survey {{of one of}} the most significant personalities of the Hungarian minority in interwar Czechoslovakia of the 1930 ’s, Count János Esterházy. The article summarizes Esterházy’s political career and political attitudes not only in interwar Czechoslovakia where in 1932 he, as a politically completely unknown personality, became leader of the Hungarian Provincial Christian-Socialist Party, assuming later, in 1936, as one of the best known figures of the Czechoslovak Hungarian minority political scene already, the position of executive president of the sole central party of the Hungarian minority in the Czechoslovak state, the United Hungarian Party. The article summarizes also his second period of political career in the separated Slovak Republic (1939 – 1945) when he led the only permitted political party in the Slovak State, the Slovak Hungarian Party, being at the same time the sole representative of the Slovak Hungarian minority in the Slovak parliament.

50|$|He was {{appointed}} Chancellor in 1383, and created Earl of Suffolk in 1385, {{the first of}} his family to hold any such title. However, in the late 1380s his fortunes radically altered, in step with those of the king. During the Wonderful Parliament of 1386 he was impeached on charges of embezzlement and negligence, a victim of increasing tensions between Parliament and Richard. He was the first official in English history to be removed from office by the process of impeachment. Even after this disgrace, he remained in royal favour, although soon fell foul of the Lords Appellant. He was {{one of a number of}} Richard's associates accused of treason by the Appellants in November 1387. After the Appellants' victory at Radcot Bridge (December 1387) and before the so-called Merciless Parliament met in February 1388, De La Pole shrewdly fled to Paris, thus escaping the fate of Sir Nicholas Brembre and Chief Justice Robert Tresilian. He remained in France for the remainder of his life. <b>Sentenced</b> <b>in</b> his <b>absence,</b> his title was stripped from him.|$|R
5000|$|Born as Daniel Nicolas Thévenon in Champlost in Burgundy in France {{and the son}} of Jean Baptiste Thévenon, he was apprenticed to a coachbuilder in Sens {{before moving}} in the early 1850s to Paris, where he {{continued}} to work as a coachbuilder. He married his shop-assistant first cousin Célestine Lacoste (1831-1916) in Paris in 1854 and they had a daughter, Emma Josephine Thévenon (1856-1912). At about this time he bought a wine shop in Bercy in Paris from a relative, M. Champroux, for £240 saved from their salaries, and soon followed this with two further shops. When Champroux went bankrupt in 1863 Thévenon, who had guaranteed some of his debts, faced bankruptcy himself for 250,000 francs. Faced with being arrested for this debt he and his wife fled France to escape their creditors and arrived in London in October 1863. In 1864 he was <b>sentenced</b> <b>in</b> his <b>absence</b> to ten years' penal servitude; by 1871 he had repaid the debts but the Supreme Court of France did not cancel his sentence until 1890.|$|R

We measure the correlation between automatically-generated scores and human judgments, and we evaluate the performance of our system when used as a classifier for identifying highly dysfluent and illformed sentences. We show that we can substantially improve on the correlation between language model perplexity scores and human judgment by combining these perplexity scores with class probabilities from a machine-learned classifier. The classifier uses linguistic features and has been trained to distinguish human translations from machine translations.

40|$|The role of {{interaural}} time difference (ITD) in perceptual grouping and selective attention was explored in 3 experiments. Experiment 1 showed mat listeners can use small differences in ITD between 2 sentences {{to say which}} of 2 short, constant target words {{was part of the}} attended <b>sentence,</b> <b>in</b> the <b>absence</b> of talker or fundamental frequency differences. Experiments 2 and 3 showed that listeners do not explicitly track components that share a common ITD. Their inability to segregate a harmonic from a target vowel by a difference in ITD was not substantially changed by the vowel being placed <b>in</b> a <b>sentence</b> context, where the sentence shared the same ITD {{as the rest of the}} vowel. The results indicate that in following a particular auditory sound source over time, listeners attend to perceived auditory objects at particular azimuthal positions rather than attend explicitly to those frequency components that share a common ITD. This article addresses a paradox. On the one hand, both everyday experience and experimental evidence (Spence & Driver, 1994; Teder & Naatanen, 1994) show that auditory attention can be directed toward sounds that come from...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was the {{development}} and assessment of a novel method for recording speech produced under varying degrees of articulatory precision in the laboratory. Three conditions were designed to elicit reduced, citation, and careful speaking styles. In the first condition, talkers read sentences while simultaneously carrying out a distractor task. In the second condition, talkers simply read the same set of <b>sentences</b> <b>in</b> the <b>absence</b> of any other task. In the third condition, talkers read the sentences but were frequently prompted by the computer to re-read the last sentence more carefully. Recordings from six talkers, three female and three male, were made and measurements were carried out along a number of dimensions that have been used in the literature to distinguish careful from reduced speech or that have been linked to differences in intelligibility between talkers. Using acoustic analysis, measures of word duration, sentence duration, overall sentence energy, word energy, sentence energy range, word energy range, pitch range of the sentence, and two measures of F 1 -F 2 vowel space dispersion were obtained for all six talkers. Overall, we observed consistent effects of speaking mode across most talkers for many of the measured dimensions. Individually...|$|R
40|$|In two experiments, we {{examined}} the behavioural and electro-physiological effects of errors in touch-typing. The effect of errors on skilled actions is an under-studied area in cognitive psychology. The available evidence suggests that errors have different effects on discrete vs. skilled and continuous actions. Our primary aim was to study the behavioural and electro-physiological effects of errors, and explore any interactions between them such as event-related potentials (ERP) and error correction via the backspace. We asked touch-typists to type 100 <b>sentences</b> <b>in</b> the <b>absence</b> of visual feedback. We recorded electro-encephalogram (EEG) as well as typing performance of touch-typists. We analysed the data using independent component analysis (ICA), {{with an emphasis on}} the difference between correct and error key-presses as well as corrected and uncorrected error key-presses. We found that the error (corrected and uncorrected) key-presses in typing were slowed, and were followed by slowed key-presses. In the EEG record, we found a considerable increase in the power of theta oscillations (3 - 8 Hz) as well as classic ERP findings (i. e. Error related negativity (ERN) and positivity (Pe). Importantly, these effects were much stronger during corrected errors compared to uncorrected errors. Our results suggest that even in a skilled action which involves more than 7 key-presses every second, it is possible to detect one's errors before the error action is completed, and that error correction can be predicted by the strength of error induced changes in the EEG record...|$|R
