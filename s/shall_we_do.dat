Wright {{completed}} his duties at Cherokee Studios aided by session musicians Peter Wood and Fred Mandel, and Jeff Porcaro played drums in Mason's stead on [...] "Mother". [...] His duties complete, Mason left the final mix to Waters, Gilmour, Ezrin and Guthrie, and travelled to New York to record his début solo album, Nick Mason's Fictitious Sports. [...] In advance of its release, technical constraints {{led to some}} changes being made to the running order and content of The Wall, with [...] "What <b>Shall</b> <b>We</b> <b>Do</b> Now?"

With the November 1979 deadline approaching, the band left the now-incorrect inner sleeves of the album unchanged.|$|E
500|$|Around this time, Fuller {{was hoping}} to prepare a {{biography}} of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, but felt that she could work on it only if she traveled to Europe. Her father's death and her sudden responsibility for her family caused her to abandon this idea. In 1836, Fuller was given a job teaching at Bronson Alcott's Temple School in Boston, where she remained for a year. She then accepted an invitation to teach under Hiram Fuller (no relation) at the Greene Street School in Providence, Rhode Island, in April 1837 with the unusually high salary of $1,000 per year. Her family sold the Groton farm and Fuller moved with them to Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts. On November 6, 1839, Fuller held the first of her [...] "conversations", discussions among local women who met in the Boston home of the Peabodys. Fuller intended {{to compensate for the}} lack of women's education with discussions and debates focused on subjects including the fine arts, history, mythology, literature, and nature. Serving as the [...] "nucleus of conversation", Fuller also intended to answer the [...] "great questions" [...] facing women: [...] "What were we born to do? How <b>shall</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> it? which so few ever propose to themselves 'till their best years are gone by". A number of significant figures in the women's rights movement attended these gatherings, including Sophia Dana Ripley, Caroline Sturgis, and Maria White Lowell.|$|E

[...] His earliest collections of poetry were his most political and led to his being championed, in the 1930s, as a [...] "proletariat poet". This description, which Patchen rejected, never stuck, since his work varied widely in subject, style and form. As his career progressed, he continued to push himself into more and more experimental styles and forms, developing, along with writers such as Langston Hughes and Kenneth Rexroth, {{what came to be}} known as jazz poetry. He also experimented with his childlike [...] "painted poems," [...] many of which were published posthumously in the 1984 collection What <b>Shall</b> <b>We</b> <b>Do</b> Without Us.|$|E
2500|$|The Folk Revival {{movement}} {{is one in}} which shanties themselves were often revived, especially as they have been viewed as a branch of heritage traditional songs of Anglophone culture. Several of the early performers in the Folk genre performed and recorded a significant number of sailor songs. For example, Paul Clayton recorded the album Whaling and Sailing Songs from the Days of Moby Dick (Tradition Records) in 1956, and Burl Ives' Down to the Sea in Ships came out in the same year. Since at least the 1950s, certain shanties have become staples of the Folk genre. This is evidenced in the popular Folk music fake book Rise Up Singing, which includes such shanties as [...] "Blow the Man Down," [...] "What <b>Shall</b> <b>We</b> <b>Do</b> with a Drunken Sailor," [...] and [...] "Bound for South Australia." ...|$|E

2500|$|Parker {{gradually}} introduced Transcendentalist {{ideas into}} his sermons. He tempered his radicalism with diplomacy and discretion, however. “I preach abundant heresies,” {{he wrote to}} a friend, “and they all go down—for the listeners {{do not know how}} heretical they are.” For years he had wrestled with the factuality of the Hebrew Scriptures, and by 1837 he was wishing “some wise man would now write a book…and show up the absurdity of…the Old Testament miracles, prophecies, dreams, miraculous births, etc.’” He was hardly alone. “‘What <b>shall</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> with the Old Testament?’ asked James Walker in 1838. ‘That question is of such frequent recurrence among laymen as well as clergymen, that any well-considered attempt to answer it, or supply the means of answering it, is almost sure of hearty welcome." [...] Questions regarding biblical realism and meaning, and the answers clergy increasingly found through the German-based higher criticism, formed the basis of liberal Christianity as it emerged and developed throughout the nineteenth century.|$|E

[...] "What?" [...] said the messenger, whose name was Jacob Hawn, the owner of mill, [...] "leave the mill and let it be burnt down? We think we can maintain it." [...] "If you maintain it" [...] said Joseph, [...] "you will do well do as you please." [...] The messenger returned and said if we thought we could maintain the mill it was Joseph’s council for us to do it, if we thought not, to come to Far West and we thought from the way the thing was represented it would be like cowards to leave and not try to maintain it, and as they agreed to be at peace we thought to gather up our houses would be useless, for we did not know that it was Joseph’s decided council for us to do so [...] [...] [...]” ...|$|E
2500|$|Sickert's {{fascination with}} urban culture {{accounted}} for his acquisition of studios in working-class sections of London, first in Cumberland Market in the 1890s, then in Camden Town in 1905. The latter location provided {{an event that}} would secure Sickert's prominence in the realist movement in Britain. [...] On 11 September 1907, Emily Dimmock, a prostitute cheating on her partner, was murdered in her home at Agar Grove (then St Paul's Road), Camden. After sexual intercourse the man had slit her throat open while she was asleep, then left in the morning. The Camden Town murder became an ongoing source of prurient sensationalism in the press. For several years Sickert had already been painting lugubrious female nudes on beds, and continued to do so, deliberately challenging the conventional approach to life painting—"The modern flood of representations of vacuous images dignified {{by the name of}} 'the nude' represents an artistic and intellectual bankruptcy"—giving four of them, which included a male figure, the title, The Camden Town Murder, and causing a controversy which ensured attention for his work. These paintings do not show violence, however, but a sad thoughtfulness, {{explained by the fact that}} three of them were originally exhibited with completely different titles, one more appropriately being What <b>Shall</b> <b>We</b> <b>Do</b> for the Rent?, and the first in the series, Summer Afternoon.|$|E

2500|$|Then {{the elders}} of the {{congregation}} said, [...] "What <b>shall</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> for wives for those who remain, since the women of Benjamin have been destroyed?" [...] And they said, [...] "There must be an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin, that a tribe may not be destroyed from Israel. However, we cannot give them wives from our daughters, {{for the children of}} Israel have sworn an oath, saying, 'Cursed be the one who gives a wife to Benjamin.'" [...] Then they said, [...] "In fact, there is a yearly feast of the Lord in Shiloh, which is north of Bethel, {{on the east side of}} the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah." [...] Therefore, they instructed the children of Benjamin, saying, [...] "Go, lie in wait in the vineyards, and watch; and just when the daughters of Shiloh come out to perform their dances, then come out from the vineyards, and every man catch a wife for himself from the daughters of Shiloh; then go to the land of Benjamin. Then it shall be, when their fathers or their brothers come to us to complain, that we will say to them, 'Be kind to them for our sakes, because we did not take a wife for any of them in the war; for it is not as though you have given the women to them at this time, making yourselves guilty of your oath.'" [...] And the children of Benjamin did so (on Tu B'Av); they took enough wives for their number from those who danced, whom they caught. Then they went and returned to their inheritance, and they rebuilt the cities and dwelt in them. So the children of Israel departed from there at that time, every man to his tribe and family; they went out from there, every man to his inheritance.|$|E
2500|$|So it was, on {{the next}} morning, that the people rose early and built an altar there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. The {{children}} of Israel said, [...] "Who is there among all the tribes of Israel who did {{not come up with}} the assembly to the Lord?" [...] For they had made a great oath concerning anyone who had not come up to the Lord at Mizpah, saying, [...] "He shall surely be put to death." [...] And the children of Israel grieved for Benjamin their brother, and said, [...] "One tribe is cut off from Israel today. What <b>shall</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> for wives for those who remain, seeing we have sworn by the Lord that we will not give them our daughters as wives?" [...] And they said, [...] "What one is there from the tribes of Israel who did not come up to Mizpah to the Lord?" [...] And, in fact, no one had come to the camp from Jabesh Gilead to the assembly. For when the people were counted, indeed, not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead was there. So the congregation sent out there twelve thousand of their most valiant men, and commanded them, saying, [...] "Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword, including the women and children. And this is the thing that you shall do: You shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman who has known a man intimately." [...] So they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young virgins who had not known a man intimately; and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan. Then the whole congregation sent word to the children of Benjamin who were at the rock of Rimmon, and announced peace to them. So Benjamin came back at that time, and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh Gilead; and yet they had not found enough for them. And the people grieved for Benjamin, because the Lord had made a void in the tribes of Israel.|$|E
2500|$|On Thursday 18 February, {{the weekly}} lecture {{proceeded}} as usual, {{though it was}} noticed that the congregation were paying {{particular attention to the}} detail of the sermon. However, when the minister finished his last prayer by asking [...] "Lord who hath believed our report; and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? where are the fruits of my poor labours among this people" [...] several people cried out publicly in response - an event rare in Scottish worship. Afterwards, some 50 people came back in anguish to the manse, expressing a strong conviction of sin and fearing dreadful punishment in the next life. Then began so great an influx of people to Cambuslang that the minister started giving daily sermons and instruction. This lasted for about seven or eight months, until the coming of autumn. Many who attended the sermons were seized with a strong conviction that they were sinners and experienced an horrific sense of future punishment, many [...] "bewailing their lost and undone condition by nature; calling themselves enemies to God, and despisers of precious Christ; declaring that they were unworthy to live {{on the face of the}} earth; that they saw the mouth of hell open to receive them, and that they heard the shrieks of the damned". The most insistent cry was [...] "what <b>shall</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> to be saved?" [...] Some beat their breasts and trembled. Many were seized with violent contortions, one woman saying afterwards that it was far worse than the pain of childbirth. Others fainted or bled at the nose. It was noted that the minister, and some of the congregation, encouraged people to give vent to their distress. Those who had been affected often went back to the manse and many spent long nights there in prayer and admonition. They returned to sermon the next day, often bandaged, and sat weeping and moaning in the front row of the congregation, or outside the entrance to the tents. This part of the process [...] of becoming aware of their sinfulness [...] was known as [...] "conviction" [...] and many were convicted. Not all, however, went on to the next stage, that is [...] "conversion". Several were converted, though, and often quite suddenly. They were [...] "raised all at once from the lowest depth of sorrow and distress, to the highest pitch of joy and happiness, crying out with triumph and exultation…that they had overcome the wicked one; that they had gotten hold of Christ!" [...] They often followed this with a joyous appeal to the congregation to pray or sing along with them.|$|E
