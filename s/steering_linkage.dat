25|$|The XM, {{released}} in 1964, {{was the first}} Falcon with an Australian-designed body; the rear taillights were raised for Australian conditions and the front end received a full-wrap chrome grill and surrounds. The <b>steering</b> <b>linkage</b> was upgraded with 9/16-inch tie rods instead of the 1/2-inch tie rods found in the US models. The suspension was also improved with the upper control arms lowered to reduce the notorious bump steer found in the North American Falcon (and early Mustangs), on which this model was based.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Reitwagen {{was destroyed}} in the Cannstatt Fire that razed the Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft Seelberg-Cannstatt plant in 1903, but several replicas exist in collections at the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart, the Deutsches Museum in Munich, the Honda Collection Hall at the Twin Ring Motegi facility in Japan, the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame in Ohio, and in Melbourne, Australia. The Deutsches Museum lent their replica to the Guggenheim Las Vegas The Art of the Motorcycle exhibition in 2001. The replicas vary as to which version they follow. The one at the AMA Hall of Fame {{is larger than the}} original and uses the complex belt tensioner and <b>steering</b> <b>linkage</b> seen in the 1884 plans, while the Deutsches Museum's replica has the simple handlebar, as well as the ring gear on the rear wheel.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} design of 1884 used a belt drive, and twist {{grip on the}} handlebars which applied the brake when turned one way and tensioned the drive belt, applying power to the wheel, when turned the other way. Roper's velocipede of the late 1860s used a similar two way twistgrip handlebar control. The plans also called for <b>steering</b> <b>linkage</b> shafts that made two right angle bends connected with gears, but the actual working model used a simple handlebar without the twist grip or gear linkage. [...] The design was patented on August 29, 1885.|$|E

50|$|Other {{systems for}} {{steering}} exist, but are uncommon on road vehicles. Children's toys and go-karts often use a very direct linkage {{in the form}} of a bellcrank (also commonly known as a Pitman arm) attached directly between the steering column and the steering arms, and the use of cable-operated <b>steering</b> <b>linkages</b> (e.g. the capstan and bowstring mechanism) is also found on some home-built vehicles such as soapbox cars and recumbent tricycles.|$|R

50|$|The <b>steering</b> <b>linkages</b> {{connecting}} the <b>steering</b> {{box and the}} wheels usually conform to a variation of Ackermann steering geometry, {{to account for the}} fact that in a turn, the inner wheel is actually travelling a path of smaller radius than the outer wheel, so that the degree of toe suitable for driving in a straight path is not suitable for turns. The angle the wheels make with the vertical plane also influences steering dynamics (see camber angle) as do the tires.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{electric}} {{golf cart}} of LIPI is designed traditionally without calculating geometric and kinematic properties of it steering layout. Furthermore, it resulting less quality of handling {{and make it}} less safe to operate. The kinematics calculation of <b>steering</b> <b>linkages</b> has been explained by Ackerman. So, this paper's purpose is to calculate and make recommendation for electric golf cart of LIPI as a solution for improving the handling quality. The result is that maximum turning angle of the car is limited by 30 ° and the car has R at 372 cm. This is an ideal value according to Ackerman calculation...|$|R

NASTRAN was {{released to the public}} in 1971 by NASA’s Office of Technology Utilization. The commercial use of NASTRAN has helped to analyze the behavior of elastic structures of any size, shape, or purpose. For example, the automotive industry uses the program to design front suspension systems and <b>steering</b> <b>linkages.</b> It is also used in designing railroad tracks and cars, bridges, power plants, skyscrapers, and aircraft. The program alone was estimated to have returned $701 million in cost savings from 1971 to 1984.

5000|$|As {{with all}} types of car customization, lots of {{different}} modifications are practiced in different combinations. One popular method of conversion involves removing all body molding, bumpers and fenders, then installing a classic Ford front axle to move the wheels forward and give the car a low, stretched look. Another popular customization is to move the stock Volkswagen axle beam forward or reverse the trailing/torsion arms and re-work the <b>steering</b> <b>linkages.</b> A Volksrod might be finished off with a chopped top and original VW wheels. Paint jobs may be flat black, or more elaborate, including with pinstriping. While Volksrods may be very elaborate, like any hot rod, many are built with few or no expensive chrome-plated or machined aluminum parts, but handmade by a [...] "cut, weld and drive" [...] owner, with simple mechanical tools, welding equipment and basic parts.|$|R
40|$|In rubber-wheeled road vehicles, the {{mechanical}} connection between {{steering wheel and}} front wheels provides steering-related feedback to the driver. The torque fed back to the driver through the <b>steering</b> <b>linkages</b> and <b>steering</b> wheel, which is called steering feel, helps the driver in controlling the vehicle. The torque feedback is reproduced via artificial methods in steer-by-wire systems {{due to the lack}} of mechanical connection. In this work, in order to minimize the physical workload and the lateral acceleration under the consideration of handling performance, optimization of a hysteresis-based steering feel has been studied. A 2 -degree-of-freedom bicycle model based on the magic formula tire model has been used for simulations and hardware-in-the-loop experiments. A mathematical model is proposed in order to create an adaptive model-based optimization of the hysteresis parameters simultaneously while driving. A hardware-in-the-loop experimental setup has been used for the driving tests. The weave and the double-lane change tests have been performed with different drivers in order to demonstrate and quantify the optimization methods that are presented in this work...|$|R

50|$|Steering {{geometry}} changes due to {{bumps in}} the road may cause the front wheels to steer in different directions together or independent of each other. The <b>steering</b> <b>linkage</b> should be designed to minimize this effect.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} types of steering. Taildragger {{aircraft}} may be steered by rudder alone (depending upon the prop wash produced by the aircraft to turn it) with a freely pivoting tail wheel, or by a <b>steering</b> <b>linkage</b> with the tail wheel, or by differential braking (the use of independent brakes {{on opposite sides of}} the aircraft to turn the aircraft by slowing one side more sharply than the other). Aircraft with tricycle landing gear usually have a <b>steering</b> <b>linkage</b> with the nosewheel (especially in large aircraft), but some allow the nosewheel to pivot freely and use differential braking and/or the rudder to steer the aircraft, like the Cirrus SR22.|$|E
40|$|The {{steering}} {{task for}} heavy haul locomotives can involve {{high levels of}} tractive effort during curving on steep gradients. Traction curving has been reported as problematic for current steering locomotive bogies [1], [3], [4]. The Centre for Railway Engineering (CRE) has been investigating traction steering performance. Improvements in traction steering performance will produce more efficient rail transport. Simulations involving curving and hunting evaluations have been completed {{for a wide range}} of traction bogie designs. A new bogie design concept is proposed involving yaw actuation of the bogie frame with forced <b>steering</b> <b>linkages</b> (AY-FS Bogie). Simulation tests have shown this concept able to reduce traction curving wear by 61 % from improved steering under traction. The bogie concept is also capable of high speed stability performance. AY-FS bogie has further advantages over AWY bogie designs, [6] in that none of the actuation equipment or sensors for AY-FS bogie’s need to be mounted on the bogie frame. Further development of the research is needed with a prototype design simulation testing to optimise the suspension settings and control design for optimised performance...|$|R

40|$|The {{steering}} system of a {{rear wheel drive}} open wheel racecar is the only directional control the driver possesses while driving. <b>Steering</b> <b>linkages</b> must be carefully designed to allow cars to navigate turns without exhausting the driver. Motorsports vehicles are designed to make tight turns while maximizing tire grip to maintain higher velocities in corners. Steering geometry must be optimized not only for car performance, but also to maximize driver comfort and improve the "feel" of the vehicle. In competitive motorsports, the {{steering system}} is critical to vehicle performance: an incorrectly designed system can at best cost a few fractions of a second on the track, and at worst cause severe driver injury. In the Formula SAE competition, student teams are tasked with designing and manufacturing all subsystems of a racecar for an annual competition while balancing safety, cost, and performance. This thesis will introduce fundamentals of steering system design, and will document in detail the design, analysis, manufacture, and testing of the 2017 MIT FSAE steering system. by Steven Gerasimoff.

5000|$|Radio-controlled cars use {{a common}} set of {{components}} for their control and operation. All cars require a transmitter, which has the joysticks for control, or in pistol grip form, a trigger for throttle and a wheel for turning, and a receiver which sits inside the car. The receiver changes the radio signal broadcast from the transmitter into suitable electrical control signals for the other components of the control system. Most radio systems utilize amplitude modulation for the radio signal and encode the control positions with pulse width modulation. Upgraded radio systems are available that use the more robust frequency modulation and pulse code modulation. Recently however, 2.4 GHz frequency radios have become the standard for hobby-grade R/C cars. The radio is wired up to either electronic speed controls or servomechanisms (shortened to [...] "servo" [...] in common usage) which perform actions such as throttle control, braking, steering, and on some cars, engaging either forward or reverse gears. Electronic speed controls and servos are commanded by the receiver through pulse width modulation; pulse duration sets either the amount of current that an electronic speed control allows to flow into the electric motor or sets the angle of the servo. On these models the servo is attached to at least the steering mechanism; rotation of the servo is mechanically changed into a force which steers the wheels on the model, generally through adjustable turnbuckle linkages. Servo savers are integrated into all <b>steering</b> <b>linkages</b> and some nitro throttle linkages. A servo saver is a flexible link between the servo and its linkage that protects the servo's internal gears from damage during impacts or stress.|$|R

40|$|The {{important}} initial {{step for}} remediation {{of hazardous waste}} is contaminant analysis since the cleanup operation can not begin until the contaminants in hazardous waste sites have been clearly identified. Ames Laboratory, one of the U. S. Department of Energy sites, has developed a robotic sampling system for automation of real-time contaminant analysis in situ which will provide the advantage of lowering the cost per sample, eliminating personnel exposure to hazardous environments, and allowing quicker results. Successful accomplishment of real-time contaminant analysis will require a remote manipulator to perform the sampling tasks in remote and unstructured surroundings, and a remote-controlled guide vehicle to move a remote manipulator into the desired sampling location;This thesis focuses on the design and construction of a remote-controlled guide vehicle to move the robotic sampling system into the contaminated field to obtain soil samples at the desired locations, {{the development of an}} integrated dynamic model of a remote manipulator, the identification of dynamic parameters in the integrated dynamic model, and the design of a mobile robotic sampling system. A four-wheeled vehicle prototype has been constructed and its performance tested manually in the field to verify the design requirements. To remotely control the vehicle, mechanical requirements to activate the brake, throttle, transmission, and <b>steering</b> <b>linkages</b> were determined based on experimental results. A teleoperated control utilizing hundred feet long umbilical cords was first employed to remotely control the vehicle. Next, the vehicle was modified to remotely operate in the field by radio control without the aid of long umbilical cords, satisfying all the design specifications;To reduce modeling error in the robotic system, the integrated dynamic system comprised of a remote manipulator (located on a trailer pulled by the remote-controlled guide vehicle) and its drive system has been modeled. The friction model as a function of velocity is included. The dynamic parameters such as velocity-dependent friction and gravity torque in the integrated dynamic model have been determined based on experimental results;Finally, a robotic arm, a sampling tool, and a soil recovery fixture for a mobile robotic sampling system to be mounted on the remote-controlled guide vehicle have been designed and analyzed. The integrated dynamic model for the robotic arm (mounted on the remote-controlled guide vehicle) and its drive system has also been developed...|$|R
