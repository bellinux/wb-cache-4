25|$|Historically, {{there are}} several {{scientific}} approaches to the explanation of temperature: the classical thermodynamic description based on macroscopic empirical variables that {{can be measured in}} a laboratory; the kinetic theory of gases which relates the macroscopic description to the probability distribution of the energy of motion of gas particles; and a microscopic explanation based on <b>statistical</b> <b>physics</b> and quantum mechanics. In addition, rigorous and purely mathematical treatments have provided an axiomatic approach to classical thermodynamics and temperature. <b>Statistical</b> <b>physics</b> provides a deeper understanding by describing the atomic behavior of matter, and derives macroscopic properties from statistical averages of microscopic states, including both classical and quantum states. In the fundamental physical description, using natural units, temperature may be measured directly in units of energy. However, in the practical systems of measurement for science, technology, and commerce, such as the modern metric system of units, the macroscopic and the microscopic descriptions are interrelated by the Boltzmann constant, a proportionality factor that scales temperature to the microscopic mean kinetic energy.|$|E

25|$|From a more {{abstract}} point of view, swarm behaviour is the collective motion {{of a large}} number of self-propelled entities. From the perspective of the mathematical modeller, it is an emergent behaviour arising from simple rules that are followed by individuals and does not involve any central coordination. Swarm behaviour is also studied by active matter physicists as a phenomenon which is not in thermodynamic equilibrium, and as such requires the development of tools beyond those available from the <b>statistical</b> <b>physics</b> of systems in thermodynamic equilibrium.|$|E
25|$|Neural field {{models are}} another {{important}} tool in studying neural oscillations {{and are a}} mathematical framework describing evolution of variables such as mean firing rate in space and time. In modeling the activity {{of large numbers of}} neurons, the central idea is to take the density of neurons to the continuum limit, resulting in spatially continuous neural networks. Instead of modelling individual neurons, this approach approximates a group of neurons by its average properties and interactions. It is based on the mean field approach, an area of <b>statistical</b> <b>physics</b> that deals with large-scale systems. Models based on these principles have been used to provide mathematical descriptions of neural oscillations and EEG rhythms. They have for instance been used to investigate visual hallucinations.|$|E
