The {{purpose of this paper}} is to provide guidance for successful alignment of space business processes with ISO 27001 standard and to present solutions for typical space industry problems in implementing risk mitigation measures. The scope of this paper is limited to the ground segment security only, space segment security is considered out of scope. Each space mission varies with security requirements and in-orbit duration depending on its mission objectives, but all missions of an organization use some common ground segment infrastructure which is shared across several missions for cost efficiency. Risk mitigation measures and strategies that protect each mission’s assets whilst benefitting from using shared infrastructure are presented in this paper. The solution allows missions with High, Medium or Low security requirements to co-exist and interoperate without compromising security.

40|$|This paper studies optimal {{monetary}} policy in a two-sector small open economy model under <b>segmented</b> <b>asset</b> markets and sticky prices. We solve the Ramsey problem under full commitment, and characterize the optimal {{monetary policy}} in {{a version of}} the model calibrated to the Chilean economy. The contributions of the paper are twofold. First, under the optimal policy the volatility of nontradable inflation is near zero. Second, stabilizing non-tradable inflation is optimal regardless of the financial structure of the small open economy. Even for a moderate degree of price stickiness, implementing a monetary policy that mitigates asset market segmentation is highly distortionary. This last result suggests that policymakers should resort to other instruments in order to correct financial imperfections. ...|$|R

At the same time, the model has completely classical long-run predictions, featuring quantity theoretic and Fisherian properties.

Our finding is, first, that {{the response of the}} money supply growth rate to a money demand shock required to stabilize inflation is not affected by the existence of a liquidity effect, but the response of the nominal interest rate is. Second, when the monetary authority adopts a Taylor rule, whether or not it should be active to obtain local determinacy of equilibria depends on the existence of a liquidity effect. Our results suggest that the monetary authority should be careful about the existence and the degree of a liquidity effect particularly when the nominal interest rate is used as the policy instrument.

It offers a theoretical framework to incorporate multiple asset holdings in a tractable heterogeneous-agent model, in which the central bank implements policies by changing the supply of nominal bond and money. This model features competitive search, which produces distributions of money and bond holdings as well as price dispersion among submarkets. At a high enough bond supply, the equilibrium shows segmentation in the asset market; only households with good income shocks participate in the bond market. When deciding whether {{to participate in the}} asset market, households compare liquidity services provided by money with returns on bond. Segmentation in the asset market is generated endogenously without assuming any rigidities or frictions in the asset market. In an equilibrium with a <b>segmented</b> <b>asset</b> market, open-market operations affect households’ participation decisions and, therefore, have real effects on the distribution of assets and prices in the economy.

40|$|Abstract. Starting {{with the}} seminal work of Black (1985 [8]) and De Long et. al (1990 [36]), {{financial}} economists have studied the impact of less informed or irrational investors (so-called "noise traders") on mis-pricing. Empirical evidence on noise traders, however, suffers from the twin difficulties of identifying noise traders and demonstrating their impact on asset prices. In this paper we study the price impact of adding noise traders {{in the form of}} distant speculators to a financial market using unique transactions level data on US residential housing. Distant purchasers may be less informed about local housing market conditions and prone to excessive reliance on capital appreciation in earning a financial return. Our evidence shows that out of town, but not local, speculators, purchase houses at times and in markets when prices are rising rapidly. Next we show that adding out of town speculators to a market causes excess house price appreciation using a novel experimental design. We also demonstrate that out of town speculators likely earn lower returns than local purchasers. We conjecture that large inflows of distant speculators might help signal newly forming bubbles and outline how our identification strategy can be used to identify potential bubbles in other settings with <b>segmented</b> <b>asset</b> markets...|$|R

40|$|This paper studies how income-based, {{progressive}} {{taxes and}} transfers may reduce aggregate volatility by protecting the economy against expectation-driven business cycles. Eliminating “local” sunspots that are arbitrarily {{close to an}} indeterminate steady state requires, for sensible parameter values, strong levels of progressivity {{so as to make}} labor supply close to inelastic. However, progressive taxes and transfers are shown to be ineffective to rule out stable deterministic cycles (and the associated “global” sunspots) that are located close to a determinate steady state. Our results are formalized within two benchmark models and show how the efficiency of progressive fiscal schemes as local automatic stabilizers depends on the fiscal base. In the first setting with heterogeneous agents and <b>segmented</b> <b>asset</b> markets in which wage income mostly finances consumption, we show that progressive taxes and transfers should be made dependent on labor income, so as to rule out local indeterminacy. On the contrary, progressive fiscal rules should be applied to capital income in an overlapping generations economy where consumption comes from savings income. Incidentally, the latter results suggest that capital income taxes may be desirable, when progressive, to make local expectation-driven fluctuations less likely. In both frameworks, key to the results is the property that progressive fiscal rules provide insurance in the presence of imperfect capital markets. progressive taxes and transfers, business cycles, sunspots, endogenous cycles. ...|$|R
