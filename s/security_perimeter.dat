25|$|Later {{investigation}} found {{that someone had}} called Lieberman's cell phone from the apartment at 4 a.m. Lieberman does not remember it, but thinks he may have awoken briefly to check his voicemail. When he got up for work at 6:30, his wife had still not returned. That evening, after the terrorist attacks, {{he was able to}} use his medical credentials to get through the <b>security</b> <b>perimeter</b> and return to their apartment. Since the window had been left open, dust from the towers had accumulated throughout. There were tracks in it from the couple's two kittens, but none from any human.|$|E
25|$|Civil {{liberties and}} {{political}} groups were {{also concerned about}} changes to NSW law enacted for the APEC meeting, giving the NSW Police Force new powers, including a suspension of the normal function of habeas corpus, freedom of movement, an excluded persons blacklist and other civil liberties. Police and security forces had also erected a <b>security</b> <b>perimeter</b> around much of inner city Sydney. Another point of criticism {{is the cost of}} security for the event with official budget figures at A$169 million. New South Wales Police Minister David Campbell justified the strong security presence and curtailment of civil liberties on the fear of 'violent protest' from the Mutiny collective, and other protest groups.|$|E

5000|$|Since {{at least}} the Roman Empire, fortifications, walls and {{barriers}} have been {{an important part of}} protecting sovereign territories and private property. <b>Perimeter</b> <b>security</b> is designed with the primary purpose to either keep intruders out or captives contained within the area the boundary surrounds. Both natural and manmade barriers can serve as <b>perimeter</b> <b>security.</b> Governments utilize <b>perimeter</b> <b>security</b> not only for the safety of their citizens, but to control the flow of commerce and immigration, as well as to protect vital infrastructure from vandals and terrorists. Property owners and organizations of all sizes use various man-made technology to achieve varying degrees of <b>perimeter</b> <b>security.</b>|$|R
25|$|Park Row, {{historically}} a major artery {{linking the}} Financial District to Chinatown and the Bowery, {{has been closed}} to civilian traffic since 2001. The NYPD asserts that this is necessary to protect its headquarters from a truck bomb attack. Chinatown residents are increasingly frustrated at the disruption caused by {{the closure of the}} thoroughfare, especially nearby residents. People who live nearby argue that the police department has placed a chokehold on an entire neighborhood and that if One Police Plaza is such an obvious terrorist target, perhaps it should be moved from a residential area. Members of the Civic Center Residents Coalition have been fighting the <b>security</b> <b>perimeter</b> around the building for years. Park Row reopened for use only by foot traffic and MTA buses in 2005, and those restrictions remain in place today.|$|E

500|$|The ISU {{created a}} <b>security</b> <b>perimeter,</b> {{beginning}} with the outer boundary, specifically bordered by King Street to the north, Lake Shore Boulevard to the south, Yonge Street to the east, and Spadina Avenue to the west, where vehicles would be restricted during the summit dates. Residents who lived within the security zone were issued registration cards prior to the summit and other pedestrians who wished to enter the security zone were only {{able to do so}} at one of 38 checkpoints, where they were required to present two pieces of photo identification and provide justification for entry. The area surrounding the Metro Toronto Convention Centre itself was fenced and off-limits to civilians and protesters. The [...] high fence, contracted to SNC-Lavalin by Public Works and Government Services Canada and installed by two Gormley, Ontario-based companies, was built at a cost of [...] and installation began on June 7. The Toronto Police Service installed 77 additional closed-circuit television security cameras in the area and purchased four Long Range Acoustic Devices which were to be in use exclusively during the summit. The ISU decided on also using water cannons for riot control.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fortress}} {{also came}} to be encircled {{by a kind of}} no man's land: the Austrians introduced a <b>security</b> <b>perimeter</b> in 1749, inside of which no permanent construction was allowed. This was in order to keep a clear field of fire, to keep the view unobstructed, and so as not to provide cover to attackers. Under the Prussians, the perimeter was extended to [...] from the external lines of fortification. Luxembourg's first railway station, built in 1859 on the Plateau Bourbon, fell within the perimeter, and therefore had to be constructed out of wood.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2005, the Task Force {{published}} a report praising the SPP initiative and pushing for greater economic integration by 2010. They repeated their {{call for the}} [...] "establishment by 2010 of a North American economic and security community, the boundaries {{of which would be}} defined by a common external tariff and an outer security perimeter." [...] In the report the Task Force said that a North American Community, which would be similar to the European Community which preceded the EU, should not rely on [...] "grand schemes of confederation or union" [...] and did not suggest a supranational government or a common currency. The Task Force’s recommendations included developing a North American common market and <b>security</b> <b>perimeter,</b> among other common goals.|$|E
50|$|Ranch Hand {{started as}} a limited program of {{defoliation}} of border areas, <b>security</b> <b>perimeters,</b> and crop destruction. As the conflict continued, the anti-crop mission took on more prominence, and (along with other agents) defoliants became used to compel civilians to leave Viet Cong-controlled territories for government-controlled areas. It was also used experimentally for large area forest burning operations that failed to produce the desired results.|$|R
5000|$|Like other U.S. Army bands, {{other than}} premier ensembles, the 191st Army Band is {{reconfigurable}} {{as a light}} infantry platoon and, during combat operations, would reinforce military police [...] "by performing command post security, all-source production section <b>security,</b> and <b>perimeter</b> <b>security</b> for the ... EPW central collecting point and EPW holding area".|$|R

2500|$|Prisoners in minimum {{security}} facilities {{are considered to}} pose little physical risk {{to the public and}} are mainly non-violent [...] "white collar criminals". Minimum security prisoners live in less-secure dormitories, which are regularly patrolled by correctional officers. As in medium {{security facilities}}, they have communal showers, toilets, and sinks. A minimum-security facility generally has a single fence that is watched, but not patrolled, by armed guards. At facilities in very remote and rural areas, there may be no fence at all. Prisoners may often work on community projects, such as roadside litter cleanup with the state department of transportation or wilderness conservation. Many minimum security facilities are small camps located in or near military bases, larger prisons (outside the <b>security</b> <b>perimeter)</b> or other government institutions to provide a convenient supply of convict labor to the institution. Many states allow persons in minimum-security facilities access to the Internet.|$|E
2500|$|On 7 December, Morsi {{supporters}} and anti-Morsi demonstrators continued their protests in different cities including Cairo, Alexandria, and Assiut. Demonstrators in Assiut chanted [...] "No Brotherhood, no Salafis, Egypt is a civic state." [...] Dozens of protesters threw rocks and glass bottles at Morsi's home in Sharkia province {{and tried to}} push aside a police barrier. Advisers and Brotherhood leaders acknowledged that outside his core base of Islamist supporters Morsi felt increasingly isolated {{in the political arena}} and even within his own government. Opposition leaders {{said in a statement that}} Morsi's 6 December dialogue offer failed to meet [...] "the principles of real and serious negotiations" [...] and displayed [...] "the complete disregard" [...] for the opposition's demands. They said they would not negotiate with Morsi until he cancels his 22 November decree and calls off the 15 December referendum on the draft constitution. Opposition protesters marched on the presidential palace and breached a <b>security</b> <b>perimeter</b> built by the military's elite Republican Guard – charged with protecting the palace – which withdrew behind the palace walls. The Egyptian newspaper Al-Masry Al-Youm also reported that individuals suspected of protesting against the Muslim Brotherhood were being tortured and beaten in a facility run by the Brotherhood in Heliopolis, a Cairo suburb.|$|E
