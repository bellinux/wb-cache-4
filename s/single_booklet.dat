50|$|After {{returning}} to Japan, Rie finished her {{primary and secondary}} education in Tokyo at Aoyama Gakuin from 1995 to 2003. In 2007, she graduated from the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design of the University of the Arts London in fine art (having shifted in interest from fashion design and graphic design). Upon graduation, she returned to Tokyo, Japan, and has since resided there full-time. Rie often designs much of her own album and <b>single</b> <b>booklets</b> and features her own paintings in them as well.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} adventure {{is essentially}} an adventure kit including a backstory, maps and one or more objectives for the players to fulfill. Some include numerous illustrations. A Dungeon Master could purchase these pre-made adventures and use it or parts of it for a gaming session. The early format was a <b>single</b> <b>booklet</b> inserted, but not fixed, in a cardboard cover. As time went by the format and information included in module increased in variety. Dark Sun modules, for example, contained top-spiralbound notebooks. Eventually, the line blurred somewhat between what was an accessory or supplement and a module.|$|E

5000|$|While AD&D {{was still}} in the works, TSR was {{approached}} by an outside writer and D&D enthusiast, John Eric Holmes, who offered to re-edit and rewrite the original rules into an introductory version of D&D. Although TSR was focused on AD&D at the time, the project was seen as a profitable enterprise and a way to direct new players to anticipate the release of the AD&D game. It was published in July 1977 as the Basic Set, collecting together and organizing the rules from the original D&D boxed set and Greyhawk supplement into a <b>single</b> <b>booklet,</b> which covered character levels 1 through 3, and included dice and a beginner's module. The booklet featured a blue cover with artwork by David C. Sutherland III. The [...] "blue booklet" [...] explained the game's concepts and method of play in terms that made it accessible to new players not familiar with tabletop miniatures wargaming. Unusual features of this version included an alignment system of five alignments as opposed to the three or nine alignments of the other versions. This Basic Set was very popular and allowed many to discover and experience the D&D game for the first time. Although the Basic Set is not fully compatible with AD&D, as some rules were simplified to make the game easier for new players to learn, players were expected to continue play beyond third level by moving on to the AD&D version.|$|E

40|$|The Nordic nations {{contribute}} {{greatly to}} Third World development but unless aid programmes {{can be sustained}} in economic, social and environmental terms by the recipients themselves they will, in the long run, have been useless. The mayor Nordic bilateral aid agencies chose 14 of their successful projects which had obvious environmental spin-offs, and commissioned a journalist from each country concerned to make an independent report - the first known uncensored evaluation of donor nations' work - at the Nordic Conference on Environment and Development at Saltsjobaden, Stockholm, in May 1987. The result is Towards Sustainable Development, a set of 14 studies, funded by SIDA and published by Panos. Although the views {{are those of the}} authors, the donors have been permitted marginal comments. The studies cover the questions that people actually on the ground are asking: who should repair the leaks in a drinking-water pipeline - trained mechanics or unskilled villagers? Where can nomad women find firewood for their bakery without furthering deforestation? How can a huge pulp mill fit into a peasant environment? Freelance Sri Lankan Journalist Mallika Wanigasundara's report of a NORAD-backed project in Hambantota, which helps peasants with loans for houses and seed, new wells, restoring tanks, taungya plantations and cookstoves, exemplifies the theme that emerges strongly from all 14 cases - that even with mas sive external aid and a less unjust distribution of the world's wealth, each recipient country must find a way of sustaining development on its own. Locally there has been considerable support for the Hanbantota programme, which has adapted Buddhist environmental traditions, perhaps - as Wanigasundara's title 'Farming with Ahimsa' suggested - because the Buddha's doctrine of non-violence to plants has taken a firm root in this region. But nonetheless crops are often trampled and water tanks damaged by animals and, if the NORAD aid scheme is to achieve long-term success, community involvement must be improved. Among the subjects covered were: marginal soil, marginal farms (Kenya); glaciers of the desert (Mauritania); why Kenyans save their soil (Kenya); research for peasant farmers (Tanzania); trees for the poor (Orissa, India); managing a forest (Tanzania); in a dry land (Turkana, Kenya); farming with Ahimsa (Sri Lanka); piped water by the people (Malawi); paper at a price (Tanzania); Mtera Dam (Tanzania) and waging war on rice pests (Bangladesh). Such independent Third World critiques must be fundamental to a complete understanding of how development can be sustainable.

40|$|Objectives Coeliac Disease (CD) is {{a common}} chronic {{autoimmune}} disorder characterised by sensitivity to gluten. This study investigated the relationships between CD illness representations, coping, self-efficacy, health related quality of life, wellbeing, psychological distress and dietary self-care (following a gluten free diet) among adults with coeliac disease. Design A questionnaire-based correlation design was used to investigate the hypothesised relationships between illness representations and outcomes. Methods Ninety six adults with CD, recruited through dietician clinics, completed a <b>single</b> <b>booklet</b> of questionnaires about their beliefs, experiences and behaviour {{in relation to their}} CD. In addition serology (CD antibody levels) and clinician rated levels of dietary self-care (both taken within one month of participation) were employed as additional measures of behaviour. Results Results of regression analyses showed that some aspects of illness representation, particularly estimates of consequences and emotional impact were related to some psychosocial outcomes but not levels of dietary self-care (which was generally high among the sample). Conclusions Illness representations may be useful in explaining some psychosocial outcome for CD, but more research would be needed to assess whether they are useful in explaining dietary behaviour among this population. Findings related to coping and self-efficacy are also discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND—Standards {{for good}} {{practice}} in clinical risk management {{issued by the}} Clinical Negligence Scheme for Trusts indicate that "appropriate information is provided to patients on {{the risks and benefits}} of proposed treatment, and of the alternatives available before a signature on a consent form is sought".  AIMS—To investigate the practicability and patient acceptability of a postal information and consent booklet for patients undergoing outpatient gastroscopy.  METHODS—Information about gastroscopy procedure, personalised appointment details, and a carbonised consent form were compiled into a <b>single</b> <b>booklet.</b> This was mailed to patients well in advance of their endoscopic procedure. Patient satisfaction for this new process was assessed by questionnaire.  RESULTS— 275 patients received a patient information booklet. Of these, 150  (54. 5 %) returned the consent form by post when they confirmed their attendance; 141  (94 %) had signed the form, and the other nine requested further information. Of the remaining 125  booklets sent out, 115  (92 %) forms were brought back {{on the day of the}} investigation having been previously signed. The remaining 10  (8 %) required further information before signing the form. An audit of 168  patients was used to test reaction to the booklet and the idea of filling in the form before coming to hospital; 155  patients (92. 2 %) reported the information given in the booklet to be "very useful", and all reported it to be "clear and understandable".  CONCLUSION—A specifically designed patient information booklet with integral consent form is accepted by patients, and improves the level of understanding prior to the investigation being carried out.    Keywords: consent; endoscopy; gastroscop...|$|E
40|$|The {{purposes}} of the study were: (1) To identify the extent of role stress and explore its antecedents and (2) To determine the impact of role stress on the university. A causal model was developed and tested to address the following question: What are the relationships of role conflict and ambiguity to selected antecedent and consequent variables as perceived by higher education administrators?^ Variables included individual characteristics of administrators (age, sex, job tenure, years in higher education administration and role orientations), organizational characteristics of the academic institutions (organizational level and formalization), role stress (role conflict and ambiguity) and organizational commitment. ^ Five hundred and fourteen (514) academic and non-academic administrators from the six publicly-supported, doctorate-granting New England universities were sent a questionnaire containing measures of all variables in a <b>single</b> <b>booklet.</b> A 70 % response rate was obtained yielding a total sample of 362. ^ Data analysis began with three separate path analyses performed on three pseudo-random splits of the total data set for cross-validation purposes. Results of these analyses were used to develop a single, trimmed, preferred model which was compared with the fully saturated model for the total data set. Subsequent analyses determined the direct, indirect, spurious, and unanalyzed effects. ^ The substantive analysis of the trimmed, preferred model demonstrated support for contentions of both role theory and the psychology of organizational commitment. That is, that the university organization can create stress, which in turn, influences commitment to it. Five variables were found to exert direct effects on organizational commitment and explained 36 % of the systematic variance in this criterion. These included: age, sex, organizational role orientation, role conflict and role ambiguity. Three variables were highly predictive of role conflict, but explained only 13 % of the systematic variance in this criterion. The three variables exerting direct effects were: formalization, professional role orientation, and organizational level. Three variables were also found to be highly predictive of role ambiguity. Formalization, years in higher education administration and age exerted direct effects and explained 29 % of the systematic variance in this criterion. ...|$|E
