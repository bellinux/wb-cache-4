40|$|While {{the recent}} {{technologies}} for XML (Extensible Markup Language) Web Services {{are an important}} step towards the goal of application-toapplication (A 2 A) and business-to-business (B 2 B) integration, they do not address all management-related issues. Our Web <b>Service</b> <b>Offerings</b> Language (WSOL) enables formal specification of important management information [...] classes of service (modeled as <b>service</b> <b>offerings),</b> various types of constraint (functional, QoS, access rights), and management statements (e. g., prices, penalties, and management responsibilities) [...] for XML Web Services. To demonstrate the usefulness of WSOL {{for the management of}} XML Web Services and their compositions, we have developed a corresponding management infrastructure, the Web <b>Service</b> <b>Offerings</b> Infrastructure (WSOI). WSOI enables monitoring and accounting of WSOL <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> and their dynamic manipulation. To support monitoring of WSOL <b>service</b> <b>offerings,</b> we have extended the Apache Axis open-source SOAP engine with WSOI-specific modules, data structures, and management ports. To support dynamic manipulation of WSOL <b>service</b> <b>offerings,</b> we have developed appropriate algorithms, protocols, and management port types and built into WSOI modules and data structures for their implementation. Apart from provisioning of WSOL-enabled XML Web Services, we are using WSOI to perform experiments comparing dynamic manipulation of WSOL <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> and alternatives...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{selection}} of transport operators {{has become a}} complex decision making process with multi-criteria aspects. Deciding on which transport operator to use depends on various <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> that can be different for each company. Retailers such as those from France, the Netherlands, Sweden and UK look to improve logistical performance {{in areas such as}} lead time, flexibility and reliability, and improve customer relations. In the past the main critical aspects of retailers were cost and service optimisation. An additional factor could play a role in their {{selection of}} transport operators and this is green <b>service</b> <b>offerings.</b>   Research question: Which <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> are important for French, Dutch, Swedish and UK retailers in their selection of transport operators? Sub question 1 : Are the retailers willing to use green <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> and why? Sub question 2 : Which of the green <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> are important for French, Dutch, Swedish and UK retailers in their selection of transport operators?   Purpose: The {{purpose of this paper is}} to find out what the most important <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> are for French, Dutch, Swedish and UK retailers in their selection of transport operators. It also aims to determine if French, Dutch, Swedish and UK retailers are willing to use green <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> and explain why. Finally, it will attempt to identify which of the green <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> are important for French, Dutch, Swedish and UK retailers in their selection of transport operators.   Method: This thesis was conducted by applying the deductive approach and is based on a quantitative research method. The sampling method used for this thesis is non-probability sampling. Data was collected through questionnaires with French, Dutch, Swedish and UK retailers. French, Dutch, Swedish and UK retailers have been selected for the sample population in order to find out how important green <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> might be for them when they are purchasing the services of a transport operator. French, Dutch, Swedish and UK retailers from different sectors were chosen in order to achieve an objective overview of the retail industry from each country when selecting transport operators.         Conclusion: Traditional <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> are more important than green <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> for French, Dutch, Swedish and UK retailers that participated in this research paper. However, when looking at the results of the data, some green <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> were perceived to be important. The authors therefore believe that when French, Dutch, Swedish and UK retailers are selecting transport operators their first focus is on the traditional <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> that are very important to them. However, if a French, Dutch, Swedish or UK retailer is encouraged by the following motivators: customer expectations, measurable improvement or economic incentives. They might pursue the green <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> that are important for their business activities...|$|R

25|$|The Romanesque House is an {{impressive}} piece of evidence of a former grange of Pforta Monastery that was constructed to ensure economic independence. They were run by bearded lay brothers (conversi). The foundation of those granges was made possible because many rulers assigned possessions in return for burial rights for family members on the monastery grounds. The Cistercians successfully sold agricultural and craft products on the markets in Halle, Naumburg, Jena and Erfurt. With even greater success, they managed to enlist parts of the peasant population into their <b>service,</b> <b>offering</b> the liege lords compensation payments for their release from personal bondage. As {{a result of its}} aggressive economic policy of establishing granges, Pforta acquired a charter in 1215 to transport carts and loads through the margraviates of Meissen and Lower Lusatia – and thus to Silesia – without being charged taxes or dues.|$|E
40|$|Dynamic {{engineering}} and adaptation of complex e- and m-commerce systems supports business agility and flexibility. This work-in-progress paper presents research on service components with several distinct classes of <b>service,</b> called <b>service</b> <b>offerings,</b> and their dynamic adaptation. Having multiple <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> enables a <b>service</b> component to provide to every consumer an appropriate {{level of service}} and quality of service (QoS). It also supports different capabilities, rights, and needs of consumers of the service component. Service components and <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> are described in a comprehensive XML-based specification that describes functionality, dependencies from other service components, functional and QoS constraints, authorization policies, as well as cost. Dynamic adaptation mechanisms that we explore {{are based on the}} manipulation of <b>service</b> <b>offerings.</b> Our mechanisms enhance robustness of the relationship between a service component and its consumer. This robustness is important in eand m-commerce systems due to the issues of trust and customer retention. 1...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – Despite the {{increased}} focus on industrial services in manufacturing companies, little research {{to date has}} focused on understanding the roles of local and central organizations in global service management. In order to address this research gap, the paper investigates how industrial <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> are developed and managed in multinational manufacturing companies. Design/methodology/approach – A qualitative case study with respondents from two internationally leading manufacturers was conducted. Eight industrial <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> with different characteristics serve as units of analysis. Findings – A broad portfolio of industrial <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> implies having a very wide range of skill sets, including both global efficiency and local responsiveness. With specialized and extensive offerings, it becomes more {{important to have a}} high level of central-local and product-service integration and to internalize service provision. Furthermore, with global customers, the central service organization needs to assume a more prominent role, initiating both an organizational exploitation of current service capabilities and the exploration of new ones. Research limitations/implications – The main focus was on <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> performed by high-volume manufacturing companies operating primarily in developed markets. Originality/value – Previous studies of industrial service management in manufacturing companies have not explicitly considered the roles of central and local organizations. Thus, the authors were able to complement the existing theory. The paper promotes {{a deeper understanding of the}} complexity of managing <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> on a global basis.
