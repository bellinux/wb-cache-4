The aforementioned tunability of properties is potentially useful in optics and photonics. In particular, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and photo-detectors based on a single nanotube have been produced in the lab.

30|$|With {{increasing}} {{development of}} miniaturized electronic devices, {{the research on}} integrated power supplies become more urgent to meet the demanding applications, including micro-robots, smart bracelets, and strain sensors [1 – 3]. Miniaturized <b>supercapacitors</b> with high-rate performance are a promising candidate for powering these future devices [4, 5]. Moreover, linear <b>supercapacitors</b> have attracted much attention because their flexibility is well suited for wearable electronics [6, 7]. However, these fiber-shaped energy devices have to experience a dramatically stretching process in practical wearable applications. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} evaluate their properties when they are dynamically stretched. Carbon nanotubes are the more suitable for the electrode materials of linear <b>supercapacitors</b> [8 – 10]. However, energy density of <b>supercapacitors</b> is not high, which hindered the further development of the linear <b>supercapacitors</b> in the field of wearable devices. In order to improve the energy density of <b>supercapacitors,</b> it is common to use pseudocapacitive material to modify electrodes, such as conductive polymers (e.g., PANI, PPy) or metal oxides (e.g., MnO 2) [9, 11 – 14]. However, linear <b>supercapacitors</b> suffer a severe loss of capacity at high rates due to the trade-off of axial electron transport. Optimizing axial conductivity of electrodes is a key to circumvent this trade-off. Compared with the flexible linear <b>supercapacitors,</b> the stretchable linear <b>supercapacitors</b> have much poorer rate performances and they are usually tested at low scan rates (0.01 – 0.1  V s− 1) [10, 11, 13]. Therefore, it is a key to improve the rate performance of the stretchable <b>supercapacitors.</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>Supercapacitors</b> are the {{promising}} energy storing device {{due to their}} high power density, fast charge time, and long-term stability. The performance of <b>supercapacitors</b> greatly depends {{on the structure of}} electrode materials [1]. Due to the large surface area, unique pore structure, and good chemical and mechanical stability, carbon materials show great potential application to catalysis [2], adsorption [3], and <b>supercapacitors</b> [4, 5]. The nanostructured carbon materials are always designed to improve the performance of <b>supercapacitors</b> [6, 7].|$|R
25|$|The {{amount of}} double-layer {{as well as}} pseudocapacitance stored per unit voltage in a <b>supercapacitor</b> is {{predominantly}} {{a function of the}} electrode surface area. Therefore, <b>supercapacitor</b> electrodes are typically made of porous, spongy material with an extraordinarily high specific surface area, such as activated carbon. Additionally, the ability of the electrode material to perform faradaic charge transfers enhances the total capacitance.|$|E

30|$|<b>Supercapacitors,</b> {{also called}} ultracapacitors, can have higher power density than batteries, {{which means that}} <b>supercapacitors</b> can deliver energy much faster (within a few seconds) than batteriers [98]. <b>Supercapacitors</b> are also capable of storing 100 – 1000 of times more energy than {{conventional}} electrolytic capacitors [98]. However, energy densities of <b>supercapacitors</b> (1 – 10  Wh/kg) are much lower than batteries (100 – 150  Wh/kg) [98, 99]. <b>Supercapacitors</b> can be classified electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors depending upon their charge storage mechanisms [100, 101]. EDLCs store charges based upon the electrostatic adsorption of electrolyte ions on porous carbon electrodes while pseudocapacitors utilize redox reactions of electroactive species such as conducting polymers and metal oxides [100, 102].|$|R
30|$|Great {{efforts are}} being devoted to {{developing}} <b>supercapacitors</b> with large energy density {{to bridge the}} performance gap between <b>supercapacitors</b> and batteries [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. In a second frontier, there also exists a huge gray area on the Ragone plot between <b>supercapacitors</b> and electrolytic capacitors. <b>Supercapacitors</b> provide much larger capacitance than electrolytic capacitors, but their frequency response is several orders of magnitude lower, typically limited below 1  Hz, whereas the latter can response at kilohertz (kHz) or higher. Therefore, conventional <b>supercapacitors</b> cannot work as capacitors for current ripple filtering and pulse smoothing. Developing high-frequency <b>supercapacitors</b> that can respond at kHz frequencies [12, 13] is an interesting area that will find many applications in power electronics, DC power design, and pulse power storage and generation, in replacing the currently used electrolytic capacitors that have a much lower capacitance density, and therefore, a bulky size.|$|R
