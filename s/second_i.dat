5|$|Goldsman took on {{the project}} as he admired the <b>second</b> <b>I</b> Am Legend film adaptation, The Omega Man. A rewrite was done to {{distance}} the project from the other zombie films inspired by the novel, {{as well as from}} the recently released 28 Days Later, although Goldsman was inspired by the scenes of a deserted London in the British horror film to create the scenes of a deserted New York City. A 40-page scene-by-scene outline of the film was developed by May 2006. When delays occurred on Smith's film Hancock, which was scheduled for 2007, it was proposed to switch the actor's films. This meant filming would have to begin in 16 weeks: production was given a green light, using Goldsman's script and the outline. Elements from Protosevich's script were introduced, while the crew consulted with experts on infectious diseases and solitary confinement. Rewrites continued throughout filming, because of Smith's improvisational skills and Lawrence's preference to keep various scenes silent. The director had watched Jane Campion's film The Piano with a low volume so as to not disturb his newborn son, and realized that silence could be very effective cinema.|$|E

From the firm foundations of real confidence I was able to get after the bowling and repay Hall, particularly, for some of the anguish he had caused me.

500|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, Tomarken asked Larson why {{he decided}} not to pass his {{remaining}} spins before he did, considering the lead he rapidly gained over Litras and Long.

[...] According to Shimizu, their relationship lasted several years and continued even while Jolie was romantically involved with other people. In 2003, when asked if she was bisexual, Jolie responded, [...] "Of course. If I fell in love with a woman tomorrow, would I feel that it's okay to want to kiss and touch her? If I fell in love with her? Absolutely! Yes!" ...|$|E
500|$|Martin, who {{finished}} second, was candid about the result, [...] "We did really well to finish <b>second.</b> <b>I</b> just don't {{think we were}} in [...] league today." [...] In the post-race press conference, Kenseth said of his result, [...] "We didn't qualify very good, but we were really happy with our car. When the race started, I didn't think we were quite {{as good as we}} were yesterday (in practice), but we were able to have really good pit stops." [...] Logano, who was involved in the biggest accident of the race, [...] "The biggest thing was, I was fine the whole time, [...] I'm not really sure what happened. The spotter was clearing me low.

500|$|AllMusic's Ned Raggett {{noted that}} [...] "Early Elvis would have {{approved}} of the music, Wilde of the words", and described the track as [...] "an audacious end result by any standard". Tim DiGravina, of the same organisation, wrote that [...] "Debating {{the merits of the}} track here would be a bit pointless, as it's a classic song from one of the last great classic bands. It might as well be called 'This Charming Song'." [...] In 2007, Oasis songwriter Noel Gallagher described the first time he heard the track: [...] "The <b>second</b> <b>I</b> heard 'This Charming Man' everything made sense. The sound of that guitar intro was incredible. The lyrics are fuckin' amazing, too. People say Morrissey's a miserable cunt, but I knew straight away what he was on about." [...] In 2006, Liz Hoggard from The Independent said that [...] "This Charming Man ... is about age-gap, gay sex".|$|E

[...] The singer also decided to record [...] "Pretty Hurts" [...] because she wanted to shift her focus to the beauty industry, which she felt was [...] "the most humiliating, judgmental place you can be as a woman". She saw the track's theme as representation of [...] "finding that thing in the world that makes you truly happy," [...] and felt that the song was in line with the album's theme of [...] "finding beauty in imperfections". Speaking to iTunes Radio, Beyoncé explained: [...] "I feel like sometimes the world is a big contest, we're all being judged. I wanted to capture how humiliating and insecure that makes you feel." ...|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after his}} {{departure}} from the British-Irish band One Direction, Zayn started working on his debut solo studio album; months later, on 22 July 2015, {{it was announced that}} Zayn was recording new music with record producer Malay Ho, after the producer posted a photo with the singer on his Instagram account. Malik's management team reached out to him because Zayn was a fan of his work with artists such as John Legend, Alicia Keys and Frank Ocean. Later, Ho heard [...] "Pillowtalk" [...] and [...] "Fool for You" [...] before signing on to produce the record, and thought Malik's voice was [...] "incredible" [...] and agreed to work with him. The two recorded most of the songs in the Studio Suite at the Palms Casino Resort, inside Malik’s Beverly Hills Hotel room, {{and in the middle of}} the woods. As recalled by Ho, the work had a [...] "super creative, super free" [...] atmosphere. Zayn admitted that [...] "He’s just an amazing person. Like from the <b>second</b> <b>I</b> met him I just knew he was kind of different. He looks into every instrument in high detail and he understands how to break it down." ...|$|E
500|$|Reprise Records {{president}} Howie Klein {{spent a lot}} of time in {{the studio}} with the band during recording, and recalled that, [...] "What I realized immediately is that they had seemed to mature in their musical direction. It wasn't just more of the same. [...] There was so much growth in the band." [...] The musical maturation displayed on Nimrod was partially inspired by Bikini Kill's Reject All American (1996), which encouraged Armstrong to balance [...] "rough punk rock songs" [...] and [...] "delicate pretty songs". [...] Armstrong wrote [...] "Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)" [...] in 1990 and did not show the song to his bandmates until the Dookie recording sessions in 1993. [...] During the sessions, the song was determined to be too different from the rest of the songs on Dookie, and producer Rob Cavallo was unsure of how to structure the recording, like [...] "Haushinka" [...] that was recorded for dookie, but omitted. [...] When the time came to record Nimrod, Armstrong decided to use the song, and Cavallo suggested they add strings to the track. [...] He sent the band to play foosball in another room while he recorded the strings, which took [...] "like fifteen, twenty minutes, maybe a half an hour at the most." [...] Cavallo reflected on his decision to add the strings [...] "I knew we had done the right thing. [...] I knew it was a hit the <b>second</b> <b>I</b> heard it." ...|$|E

500|$|Prior to {{independence}} being declared, a Committee of Five {{was charged with}} drafting the Declaration, and included Adams, along with Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Robert R. Livingston and Roger Sherman. The Committee, after discussing the general outline that the document should follow, decided that Jefferson would write the first draft. Jefferson particularly thought Adams should write the document; but Adams persuaded the Committee to choose Jefferson while agreeing to consult with Jefferson personally. Adams recorded his exchange with Jefferson on the question: Jefferson asked, [...] "Why will you not? You ought to do it." [...] To which Adams responded, [...] "I will not – reasons enough." [...] Jefferson replied, [...] "What can be your reasons?" [...] And Adams responded, [...] "Reason first, you are a Virginian, and a Virginian ought to appear {{at the head of}} this business. Reason <b>second,</b> <b>I</b> am obnoxious, suspected, and unpopular. You are very much otherwise. Reason third, you can write ten times better than I can." [...] "Well," [...] said Jefferson, [...] "if you are decided, I will do as well as I can." [...] Adams concluded, [...] "Very well. When you have drawn it up, we will have a meeting." [...] The Committee left no minutes, and the drafting process itself is uncertain – accounts written many years later by Jefferson and Adams, although frequently cited, are otherwise contradictory. Although the first draft was written primarily by Jefferson, Adams assumed a primary role in its completion. After editing the document further, Congress approved it on July 4. Many years later Jefferson hailed Adams as [...] "the pillar of [...] support on the floor of Congress, [...] ablest advocate and defender against the multifarious assaults it encountered." ...|$|E

[...] All of us are afraid to be affected or sentimental, and therefore the general nature of our family relationships is comradely, or masculine, so to speak." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reflecting in 1993 on his {{relatively}} late {{start in}} writing fiction, DeLillo said [...] "I wish I had started earlier, but evidently I wasn’t ready. First, I lacked ambition.
