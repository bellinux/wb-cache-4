5|$|During {{a routine}} liposuction {{operation}} in Winnetka, Illinois, Dr. Harrison Lloyd (John Juliani) suddenly begins to remove so much fat {{from a patient}} that the patient dies. Following the unusual experience, Lloyd tells Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) that he killed the patient because he was possessed. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is skeptical about Lloyd's claims, believing he's only making it up to escape legal consequences. Mulder inspects the operation room and discovers a pentagram burned into the floor; he begins to suspect that witchcraft might have {{played a part in}} the crime. Meanwhile, the staff at Lloyd's clinic are shocked when another plastic surgeon, Dr. Ilaqua (Paul Raskin), murders an elderly patient by burning a hole through her cheek and neck with a <b>surgical</b> <b>laser,</b> severing her brain stem. Scully interviews Ilaqua, who claims that he cannot remember anything of the incident. Mulder's suspicions are strengthened when he reviews the tape of the second murder, and he sees a pentagram-like pattern on the stomach of the victim.|$|E

50|$|Holo/Or's Dual Wavelength lens was {{the first}} {{commercial}} DOE in the world. These lenses correct the strong chromatic and spherical aberrations between a CO2 laser and its red aiming, and unite both beams to a single diffraction-limited focal point beam, {{by the use of}} a diffractive surface pattern. This product continues to be used in <b>surgical</b> <b>laser</b> systems and FTIR systems.|$|E
50|$|Hard tissue <b>surgical</b> <b>lasers</b> are {{dominated}} by Er:YAG lasers operating at the wavelengths of 2.94 µm. Laser eye surgery utilizes excimer lasers in the UV range of wavelengths. Unlike many solid-state and diode lasers in the visible and near infrared wavelength range (600-2,000 nm), the carbon dioxide laser wavelength (10.6 µm) is highly absorbed by in-vivo soft tissues containing water. Furthermore, modern CO2 laser technology makes these lasers far more affordable than solid-state Er:YAG lasers, which also feature a wavelength that is highly absorbed by water. Because of their wavelength and precision, CO2 lasers remain the dominant soft-tissue <b>surgical</b> <b>lasers.</b>|$|R

50|$|After asking Magneto {{which of}} their philosophies was right, Karima helps Magneto {{to revive the}} Professor from his coma and defends him against Joanna Cargill's murder attempt. Karima tries to stop Cargill by bombarding her with {{microwave}} radiation, but her physical invulnerability proves {{to be too much}} for her, and Cargill severely damages her. Magneto manages to stop Cargill from killing Xavier by firing a <b>surgical</b> <b>laser</b> into her eye when Exodus shows up and after trying to kill Magneto, engages the Professor in a fight on the astral plane.|$|E
50|$|He {{has been}} an avid proponent of furthering the use of lasers in foot and ankle surgery. Inspired {{by the work of}} Isaac Kaplan, (considered {{by many to be the}} father of laser surgery,) he studied Kaplan’s {{research}} and applied it to foot and ankle surgery helping to pioneer several techniques with the CO2 laser. He has written numerous publications on the application for their use beginning in 1986 with the publication of “Soft Tissue Bunion Repair with a CO2 Surgical Laser” in The Journal of Current Podiatric Medicine which explains the <b>surgical</b> <b>laser</b> technique he helped develop.|$|E
50|$|After {{the events}} of Messiah Complex, she escaped with the other Acolytes and Professor X's body, taking him to an unknown part of the world. Frenzy in {{particular}} did not {{want anything to do}} with Professor Xavier, and instead wished to kill him. After arguing with her fellow Acolytes over the matter, Frenzy confronted Xavier, Omega Sentinel, and a depowered Magneto, and attacked, severely damaging Omega Sentinel. She was stopped by Magneto, who used a <b>surgical</b> <b>laser</b> on Frenzy's eye to fry her brain. While Xavier thought she was dead, Magneto revealed she is most likely alive. Exodus, upon learning of this, swore to destroy Magneto.|$|E

50|$|Laser {{surgery is}} {{commonly}} used on the eye. Techniques used include LASIK, {{which is used to}} correct near and far-sightedness in vision, and photorefractive keratectomy, a procedure which permanently reshapes the cornea using an excimer laser to remove a small amount of tissue. Types of <b>surgical</b> <b>lasers</b> include carbon dioxide, argon, Nd:YAG laser, and Potassium titanyl phosphate.|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} use of lasers {{in surgery}} and medicine began only {{shortly after the}} development of the first working laser system. However, the development of practical, effective, and safe <b>surgical</b> <b>lasers</b> has been lengthy with many obstacles and delays.

50|$|The CO2 laser {{remains the}} best <b>surgical</b> <b>laser</b> for {{the soft tissue}} where both cutting and {{hemostasis}} are achieved photo-thermally (radiantly). CO2 lasers {{can be used in}} place of a scalpel for most procedures, and are even used in places a scalpel would not be used, in delicate areas where mechanical trauma could damage the surgical site. CO2 lasers are the best suited for soft tissue procedures in human and animal specialties, as compared to other laser wavelengths. Advantages include less bleeding, shorter surgery time, less risk of infection, and less post-op swelling. Applications include gynecology, dentistry, oral and maxillofacial surgery, and many others.|$|E
50|$|The crew faces many {{obstacles}} during the mission. An arteriovenous fistula {{forces them to}} detour through the heart, where cardiac arrest must be induced to avoid turbulence, through the inner ear (all outside personnel have to remain silent to prevent turbulence) and replenish their supply of oxygen in the lungs. When the <b>surgical</b> <b>laser</b> needed to destroy the clot is damaged, it becomes obvious there is a saboteur on the mission. They are forced to cannibalize their wireless telegraph to repair the device. By the time they finally reach the clot, they have only six minutes remaining to operate and then exit the body.|$|E

50|$|The {{gameplay}} of Trauma Center: Under the Knife 2 {{is similar}} to its predecessor, featuring improved graphics and surgical instruments. The game is divided into multiple chapters on a linear plotline. In each chapter, the player must complete an operation using the Touch Screen. The player is ranked based on multiple scoring factors. Once a chapter is completed, it can be replayed on another difficulty level. Extra, difficult chapters are unlocked upon the game's completion. Surgical tools used include the <b>surgical</b> <b>laser,</b> antibiotic gel, drain, forceps, ultrasound, magnification tool, scalpel, needle, syringe, defibrillator, wire, and an air compressor and penlight in extenuating circumstances. The player can also use the Healing Touch once per operation to slow time.|$|E
50|$|An {{option for}} {{minimally}} invasive and long-term effective therapy is laser phototherapeutic keratectomy. Laser PTK involves the <b>surgical</b> <b>laser</b> {{treatment of the}} cornea to selectively ablate cells on the surface layer of the cornea. It is thought that the natural regrowth of cells in the following days {{are better able to}} attach to the basement membrane to prevent recurrence of the condition. Laser PTK {{has been found to be}} most effective after epithelial debridement for the partial ablation of Bowman's lamella, which performed prior to PTK in the surgical procedure. This is meant to smoothen out the corneal area that the laser PTK will then treat. In some cases, small-spot PTK, which only treats certain areas of the cornea may also be an acceptable alternative.|$|E
50|$|During {{the summer}} of 2009, rapid {{evaporative}} ionization mass spectrometry (REIMS) was described. This is the second generation method. Primarily, lipid components of tissues provide the information, but different metabolite molecules and certain proteins also allow detection. The most important advantage of the specificity of mass spectrometry data is at the histological level, providing the opportunity to identify biological tissue based on chemical composition. The REIMS method is unique, in that, while the above-described mass spectrometry techniques specific to the particular method developed ion sources should be used, {{but it is difficult}} in the case of ion source devices used in surgical practice. With the operation of a variety of tissue-cutting tools, such as a diathermy knife, a <b>surgical</b> <b>laser,</b> or an ultrasonic tissue atomizer, an aerosol is formed having a composition characteristic of the tissue cut, which also contains ionized cell constructs.|$|E
50|$|Because the {{infrared}} laser is {{invisible to the}} surgeon's eye, typically a companion HeNe laser is used in conjunction. However, the eye lens acts as a prism, so {{the infrared}} light bends at a shallower angle than the red light, causing chromatic aberration. This means the area highlighted by the HeNe laser is not precisely the area being affected Nd:YAG laser, and therefore some <b>surgical</b> <b>lasers</b> have an added adjustment to compensate.|$|R

50|$|While Roger is gone, Herman spies Jessica Rabbit {{pushing a}} cart of milk bottles and gives chase, {{eventually}} following a runaway milk bottle into {{the emergency room}} where Roger is strapped to the table while the surgeons had disappeared for a lunch break. Herman mistakes a large <b>surgical</b> <b>laser</b> for a bottle and climbs up onto it, nearly dissecting Roger in the process. The laser detaches itself from the ceiling and flings a table of scalpels and hypodermic needles at Roger, who avoids them, but is electrocuted in the process. The laser flies {{around the room and}} lodges itself under Roger's stretcher and he and Herman both eject from the emergency room, causing Roger to gag up the rattle and Baby Herman to again swallow it, before crashing into a wheelchair, they then fly down the hall and into an open elevator shaft due to wet floors causing the wheelchair they landed on to skid out of control. Baby Herman's diaper parachutes him safely to a floor while Roger ends up getting crushed by an elevator while trying to catch Herman. Eventually they end up in a room with piles of gas pumps which are ignited and the pair are launched miles into the air. As they fall, Herman coughs up the rattle and Roger swallows it again. As they crash back into the hospital, Roger crashes through several floors before landing smack down on the receptionist floor in the hospital. As he recovers, Baby Herman lands on Roger, causing him to cough up the rattle again, finally ending their adventure. But Roger's celebration is short lived when he sees the bill for their rampant destruction and faints that he didn't win again. Herman then crawls over to the rattle and as the screen fades to black there is a gulping sound as he again swallows the rattle.|$|E
