In response, Gulf Arab states have started to make strategic investments in the country, with Saudi Arabia building livestock export infrastructure and the United Arab Emirates purchasing large farmlands. Most livestock is exported through the northern Port of Bosaso and Port of Berbera. In March 2013, livestock traders also resumed exports from the southern Port of Mogadishu.

40|$|Salting is {{an ancient}} {{technology}} widely used {{in combination with other}} actions to preserve meat by water activity depression and development of desired sensorial properties. In recent times the health and nutritional concerns about sodium intake has led to a reduction of the salt content in processed meat products also {{in the case of the}} traditional ones. This is not easy task in the dry cured ham as salt plays an important technological role in the control of endogenous enzymes involved in the development of the main quality characteristics and in the water state of the final product. In this study the effects of changes in the salting process conditions on the salt diffusion and water state of a traditional smoked dry cured ham have been investigated. Raw hams of two different size (small-S and large-L) were subjected to a 2 - or 3 - salting steps process. Salt content, moisture and aw were determined on three muscle portions of the ham before and after salting up to 90 days of processing. The decrease of the number of salting steps reduced the salt diffusion and the salt content of the inner regions of the L-hams while no meaningful effects occurred when the same experimental procedure was applied to the small size raw hams. NaCl content and aw values of all the ham samples resulted to fit a linear model (r 2 > 0. 80) and the linear equation was used to predict the final aw value of the differently <b>salted</b> <b>dry</b> cured hams. The predictive model highlighted the risk that based on the salt content determined at the end of the resting, 2 -salting steps-L dry-cured hams will achieve an aw > 0. 92 value that could impair the microbial stability of the product and compromise the sensory quality.

40|$|We {{believe that}} researching the cuisine {{consumed}} by the royal family, in particular the king, during the 500 -year long Chosun Dynasty is an interesting and meaningful endeavor. This task {{is an important part}} of unraveling the cultural significance of Korean cuisine in the 21 st century, a new age of gastronomy. Until now, research has largely focused on recreating Chosun royal cuisine based on oral statements from staff in the last royal kitchen or the Uikwe (儀軌), the Royal Protocols which recorded food consumed at banquets. However, little research has been conducted on ordinary royal cuisine {{consumed by the}} king, mainly because of a lack of materials to study. This article aims to shed light on this topic and recreate what every day royal cuisine looked like in the late stages of the Chosun Dynasty by examining joseoksangsikbalgi (朝夕上食撥記, memos of morning and evening ancestral rites table) and judaryebalgi (晝茶禮撥記, memos of daytime tea ceremonies). The memos are similar to the chanpumdanja (饌品單子, literally meaning “a list of dishes served on the table”) that recorded national banquets and therefore do not contain records of ordinary royal cuisine. However, the memos of morning and evening ancestral rites table still remain. These documents describe food offered to the deceased, which was the same as the meals they regularly ate while alive. Accordingly, we attempted to reproduce the traditional table setting for ordinary royal cuisine served to King Kojong (高宗) by analyzing these memos. King Kojong (1852 – 1919) was the 26 th king of the Chosun Dynasty, and a detailed description of the sangsik (上食, ancestral rites table) prepared following his death in January 1919 is present in the morning and evening sangsik memos and daytime tea ceremony memos from October 11, 1919. After analyzing the memos from after King Kojong's death in 1919, we were able to determine that the cuisine consisted of rice as bap (a main staple rice), kuk (a kind of soup), tang (stew), banchan (side dishes) such as meat, jeok (skewers), jeon (Korean pancakes), greens and <b>salted</b> <b>dry</b> fish, kimchi, seasonings such as soy sauce, kochujang (red pepper paste) and mustard as well as fruits and fruit salad for dessert. We determined that in addition to bap (rice), kuk (soup), tang (stew), kimchi and sauces, there were 7 – 9 banchan (side dishes) that served to create a balanced meal. On examination of the esthetic elements of Chosun royal cuisine, we found that the cuisine followed Confucian customs and formalities, and the kobaeumsik (고배음식, religious food serviced by layer upon layer) that symbolizes the power of the king. In addition to this, royal cuisine also embodied the philosophy of yaksikdongwon (藥食同源), an ideology which focuses on the health function of food. It was also nutritionally balanced and achieved synergy between yin (陰) and yang (陽). We believe that studying the cuisine of the Chosun royal family will ultimately play a role in spreading awareness about Korean royal cuisine around the world and creating materials that can be referred to for further research on royal cuisine and culture. However, we cannot be certain that the records present in the sangsik memos are truly representative of what the king ate on a daily basis, and more detailed analysis is required on this point...|$|E
