40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the {{challenges}} faced whilst developing <b>exclusion</b> <b>lists</b> for the high-interaction client honeypot, Capture-HPC. <b>Exclusion</b> <b>lists</b> are Capture client system behaviours which {{are used in the}} decision making process when determining if a particular behaviour is malicious or benign. As <b>exclusion</b> <b>lists</b> are the main decision making method used by Capture-HPC to classify a given webpage as benign or malicious, we identify a number of issues with current research which are often overlooked. <b>Exclusion</b> <b>lists</b> by nature require constant updating as they are developed to meet the specific requirements of a particular operating system, web browser and application system environment. Any changes to these would mean the possibility of a given client to display different benign behaviour which consequently means new exclusions required. As a result of their specific version requirements, <b>exclusion</b> <b>lists</b> are not transferable from clients. We propose a set of recommendations to aid in the creation of <b>exclusion</b> <b>lists.</b> We also present and discuss some common drive-by-download attacks which we have captured using our Windows 7 compatible <b>exclusion</b> <b>lists...</b>|$|R

It places the <b>exclusion</b> <b>lists</b> {{in the context of the}} social and political structure of the United States and the state of Florida, and interprets its significance within that context. I provide a detailed accounting of the contents of the lists, identify ways in which the lists reveal weaknesses in Florida’s voter list maintenance procedures up to 2000, and identify the types of errors made and biases in the production {{and use of the}} lists. The three major findings of the analysis are: a) the 2000 felons’ <b>exclusion</b> <b>list</b> had a considerable number of errors in it, probably more than 25 % of the names on the list were on there in error; b) these errors were racially biased, such that more African-American registered voters were on the list in error than either Whites or Latinos; and c) that the decentralized process by which the felons’ list was used to purge the voter rolls resulted in a sometimes judicious but sometimes partisan purging process – Democratic county supervisors were less likely to use the felons’ list than Republican ones, but even the latter found considerable, biased errors in the list. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMass spectrometry, in {{the past}} five years, has {{increased}} in speed, accuracy and use. With the ability of the mass spectrometers to identify increasing numbers of proteins the identification of undesirable peptides (those not from the protein sample) has also increased. Most undesirable contaminants originate in the laboratory and come from either the user (e. g. keratin from hair and skin), or from reagents (e. g. trypsin), that are required to prepare samples for analysis. We found that a significant amount of MS instrument time was spent sequencing peptides from abundant contaminant proteins. While completely eliminating non-specific protein contamination is not feasible, it is possible to reduce the sequencing of these contaminants. For example, <b>exclusion</b> <b>lists</b> can provide a list of masses {{that can be used to}} instruct the mass spectrometer to ‘ignore’ the undesired contaminant peptides in the list. We empirically generated be-spoke <b>exclusion</b> <b>lists</b> for several model organisms (Homo sapiens, Caenorhabditis elegans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Xenopus laevis), utilising information from over 500 mass spectrometry runs and cumulative analysis of these data. Here we show that by employing these empirically generated lists, it was possible to reduce the time spent analysing contaminating peptides in a given sample thereby facilitating more efficient data acquisition and analysis. Biological significanceGiven the current efficacy of the Mass Spectrometry instrumentation, the utilisation of data from ~ 500 mass spec runs to generate be-spoke <b>exclusion</b> <b>lists</b> and optimise data acquisition is the significance of this manuscript.

50|$|The key {{distinction}} {{is that a}} warranty strictly covers defects in workmanship and materials, while service plans cover product failure in general with a <b>list</b> of <b>exclusions.</b> While the <b>exclusion</b> <b>list</b> includes most situations that would disqualify a product from warranty coverage, {{there are things that}} fall outside the product's condition that aren't excluded, such as power surges. However, this is offset by the infrequency of covered conditions, and misinterpretation.
