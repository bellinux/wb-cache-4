25|$|Other cities had mints {{because they}} were the capitals of principalities subject to the Holy See, or in virtue of a {{privilege}} granted them by some prince; and when these feudal states fell to the Holy <b>See,</b> <b>they</b> retained the mints as papal establishments. This was so in the case of Camerino (from Leo X to Paul III), Urbino, Pesaro and Gubbio (under Julius II, Leo X and Clement XI), Ferrara (from Clement VIII), Parma and Piacenza (from Julius II to Paul III).|$|E
25|$|The first {{mention of}} radar in the UK was a 1930 {{suggestion}} made by W. A. S. Butement and P. E.

The War Office was uninterested and did not provide funding for further development. The matter was mentioned in passing in the January 1931 issue of the Inventions Book of the Royal Engineers.|$|E

25|$|The Slitheen {{appeared}} in the New Series Adventures novel The Monsters Inside by Stephen Cole. When the Ninth Doctor and Rose are arrested in the Justicia System in the year 2501, the Doctor shares a cell with Dram Fel-Fotch and Ecktosca Fel-Fotch Happen-Bar Slitheen, who claim that after the Earth incident, {{the remnants of the}} family went bankrupt and had become historians. The Slitheen had not actually given up business, and were in conflict with a more influential family, the Blathereen. When the Doctor and Rose defeat an attempted Blathereen takeover of the system, the Slitheen are pleased to <b>see</b> <b>they</b> can once again become the profit-holders of their race. The Blathereen were mentioned again in the Sarah Jane adventures episode Revenge of the Slitheen.|$|E
25|$|Eyelid {{fluttering}} {{artifacts of}} a characteristic type were previously called Kappa rhythm (or Kappa waves). It is usually {{seen in the}} prefrontal leads, that is, just over the eyes. Sometimes they are seen with mental activity. They are usually in the Theta (4–7nbsp&Hz) or Alpha (7–14nbsp&Hz) range. They were named because they were believed to originate from the brain. Later study revealed they were generated by rapid fluttering of the eyelids, sometimes so minute {{that it was difficult}} to <b>see.</b> <b>They</b> are in fact noise in the EEG reading, and should not technically be called a rhythm or wave. Therefore, current usage in electroencephalography refers to the phenomenon as an eyelid fluttering artifact, rather than a Kappa rhythm (or wave).|$|E
25|$|The other {{surprise}} was that ground returns caused a false signal that always {{appeared at the}} same range as the aircraft's current altitude, no matter where the dish was pointed. This was {{in much the same}} fashion as the Mk. IV, but in this case, the signal was much smaller whenever the dish was not pointed down. Instead of a wall of noise at the range of the aircraft's altitude, the signal caused a faint ring, leaving targets on either side visible. The ring was initially very wide, caused by returns not only directly under the aircraft but further away as well. After several months of work, Hodgkin and Edwards managed to provide a tuning control that muted down the weaker signals, leaving a sharp ring indicating the aircraft altitude. This too was a useful indicator for the operators, as they could <b>see</b> <b>they</b> were at the same altitude as their target when the ring overlapped the target blip.|$|E

25|$|Feeling qualms of guilt, {{they went}} to go tell the king of Samaria, and called to the porters of the city telling them what they had seen, and the porters told the king's {{household}} within. The king arose in the night, and told his servants that he suspected that the Arameans had hidden in the field, thinking that when the Samaritans came out, {{they would be able}} to get into the city. One of his servants suggested that some men take five of the horses that remained and go see, and they took two chariots with horses to go and <b>see.</b> <b>They</b> went after the Arameans as far as the Jordan River, and all the way was littered with garments and vessels that the Arameans had cast away in their haste, and the messengers returned and told the king. So the people went out and looted Arameans' camp, so that the price of fine flour and two measures of barley each dropped to a shekel, as God had said it would. And the king appointed the captain on whom he leaned to take charge of the gate, and the people trampled him and killed him before he could taste of the flour, just as the man of God Elisha had said.|$|E
25|$|Cao Cao {{had stayed}} in Wan for more than 10 days when Zhang Xiu {{suddenly}} rebelled and launched a surprise attack on Cao's camp. Cao Cao was caught unprepared so he retreated with a few horsemen. Dian Wei stood guard {{at the entrance to}} the camp and prevented Zhang Xiu's soldiers from advancing further. The enemy then scattered and broke into Cao Cao's camp from the other entrances. Dian Wei had about a dozen men with him and they were all heavily outnumbered by Zhang Xiu's forces. However, Dian Wei fought bravely with a long ji, and with each swing of his weapon, he broke more than ten enemy spears. As the battle went on, Dian Wei's men were eventually all killed and Dian himself had sustained several wounds all over his body, but he continued fighting the enemy at close quarters with short weapons. Dian Wei grabbed two enemies and killed them, and the others did not dare to approach him. Dian Wei then rushed forward and slew several more enemy soldiers before eventually succumbing to his wounds. Just before his death, he was still glaring and swearing at the enemy. Only after confirming that Dian Wei was dead did the enemies dare to come forward and decapitate him. Dian Wei's head was passed around for Zhang Xiu's men to <b>see.</b> <b>They</b> also came to look at his headless body.|$|E

500|$|The game's {{weak and}} {{inconsistent}} enemy artificial intelligence {{was a common}} subject of criticism.

The gadgery {{was seen as a}} useful gameplay feature, with AllGame noting that players need to figure out the proper way to use each gadget. Although GameZone highlighted the multiplayer mode for its replay value and teamplay options, critics agreed that the game felt short in comparison to Perfect Dark. The artificial intelligence of multiplayer bots was also a frequent criticism. According to GameSpot, [...] "they generally amount to nothing more than fragging".

500|$|From his {{vantage point}} William Hulton {{perceived}} the unfolding events as {{an assault on}} the yeomanry, and on L'Estrange's arrival at 1:50pm, at the head of his hussars, he ordered them into the field to disperse the crowd with the words: [...] "Good God, Sir, don't you <b>see</b> <b>they</b> are attacking the Yeomanry; disperse the meeting!" [...] The 15th Hussars formed themselves into a line stretching across the eastern end of St Peter's Field, and charged into the crowd. At about the same time the Cheshire Yeomanry charged from the southern edge of the field. At first the crowd had some difficulty in dispersing, as the main exit route into Peter Street was blocked by the 88th Regiment of Foot, standing with bayonets fixed. One officer of the 15th Hussars was heard trying to restrain the by now out of control Manchester and Salford Yeomanry, who were [...] "cutting at every one they could reach": [...] "For shame!

500|$|In March 1931 Gibbons {{had become}} engaged to Allan Webb, a budding actor and opera singer five years her junior.

On 1 April 1933 the couple were married at St Matthew's, Bayswater.

[...] It had won against works by two [...] more experienced writers, Bowen and Rosamond Lehmann. [...] This outcome irritated Virginia Woolf, herself a former Prix [...] Étranger winner, who wrote to Bowen: [...] "I was enraged to <b>see</b> <b>they</b> gave the £40 (the cash value of the prize) to Gibbons; still, now you and Rosamond can join in blaming her". Cooke observes that of all the Prix [...] Étranger winners from the inter-war years, only Cold Comfort Farm and Woolf's To the Lighthouse are remembered today, and that only the former has bequeathed a phrase that has passed into common usage: [...] "something nasty in the woodshed".|$|E
