The first sensor estimates combustion variability {{for the purpose of}} controlling exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and the second sensor estimates the pressure peak position for control of ignition timing. Use of EGR in engines is important because the technique can reduce fuel consumption and NOx emissions, but recirculating too much can have the adverse effect with e. g. increased fuel consumption and poor driveability of the vehicle. Since EGR also affects the phasing of the combustion (because of the diluted gas mixture with <b>slower</b> <b>combustion)</b> it is also necessary to control ignition timing otherwise efficiency will be lost.

Hemicellulose attained 48 % decompositionafter torrefaction at 523 K while lignin decomposition was limited to 65 % after torrefaction at 573 K. Co-torrefaction ligno-hemicellulosic compounds followed a similar trend for torrefaction behavior of biomass samples.

By measuring the quantity of carbon dioxide and heat produced by confining a live guinea pig in this apparatus, and by comparing the amount of heat produced when sufficient carbon was burned in the ice calorimeter to produce the same amount of carbon dioxide as that which the guinea pig exhaled, they concluded that respiration was in fact a <b>slow</b> <b>combustion</b> process.

6000|$|By the words, {{necessary}} of life, I mean whatever, of {{all that}} man obtains by his own exertions, has been from the first, or from long use has become, so important to human life that few, if any, whether from savageness, or poverty, or philosophy, ever attempt to do without it. To many creatures there is in this sense but one necessary of life, Food. To the bison of the prairie it is {{a few inches of}} palatable grass, with water to drink; unless he seeks the Shelter of the forest or the mountain's shadow. None of the brute creation requires more than Food and Shelter. The necessaries of life for man in this climate may, accurately enough, be distributed under the several heads of Food, Shelter, Clothing, and Fuel; for not till we have secured these are we prepared to entertain the true problems of life with freedom and a prospect of success. Man has invented, not only houses, but clothes and cooked food; and possibly from the accidental discovery of the warmth of fire, and the consequent use of it, at first a luxury, arose the present necessity to sit by it. We observe cats and dogs acquiring the same second nature. By proper Shelter and Clothing we legitimately retain our own internal heat; but with an excess of these, or of Fuel, that is, with an external heat greater than our own internal, may not cookery properly be said to begin? Darwin, the naturalist, says of the inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego, that while his own party, who were well clothed and sitting close to a fire, were far from too warm, these naked savages, who were farther off, were observed, to his great surprise, [...] "to be streaming with perspiration at undergoing such a roasting." [...] So, we are told, the New Hollander goes naked with impunity, while the European shivers in his clothes. Is it impossible to combine the hardiness of these savages with the intellectualness of the civilized man? According to Liebig, man's body is a stove, and food the fuel which keeps up the internal combustion in the lungs. In cold weather we eat more, in warm less. The animal heat {{is the result of a}} <b>slow</b> <b>combustion,</b> and disease and death take place when this is too rapid; or for want of fuel, or from some defect in the draught, the fire goes out. Of course the vital heat is not to be confounded with fire; but so much for analogy. It appears, therefore, from the above list, that the expression, animal life, is nearly synonymous with the expression, animal heat; for while Food may be regarded as the Fuel which keeps up the fire within us--and Fuel serves only to prepare that Food or to increase the warmth of our bodies by addition from without--Shelter and Clothing also serve only to retain the heat thus generated and absorbed.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that direct-injection (DI) is a {{technology}} enabler for stratified combustion in spark-ignition (SI) engines. At full-load or wide-open throttle (WOT), partial charge stratification can suppress knock, enabling greater spark advance and increased torque. Such split-injection or double-pulse injection strategies are employed when using gasoline in DI (GDI). However, as the use of biofuels is set to increase, is this mode still beneficial? In the current study, the authors attempt to answer this question using two gasoline-alternative biofuels: firstly, ethanol; the widely used gasoline-alternative biofuel and secondly, 2, 5 -dimethylfuran (DMF); the new biofuel candidate. These results have been benchmarked against gasoline in a single-cylinder, spray-guided DISI research engine at WOT (Î»= 1 and 1500 rpm). Firstly, single-pulse start of injection (SOI) timing sweeps were conducted with each fuel to find the highest volumetric efficiency and IMEP. The resulting optimum SOI timing for gasoline was then used as the first injection (SOI 1) with each fuel in the split-injection tests. In this instance, second SOI timing (SOI 2) sweeps were made using two split-ratios (SOI 1 :SOI 2 = 1 : 1 and 2 : 1). For the single-pulse SOI timing sweeps, the change in IMEP when using ethanol is symmetrical either side of the maximum. However, when using gasoline and DMF, the behavior is asymmetrical, with maximums later and earlier than with ethanol, respectively. For split-injection, the maximum IMEP increases when fuelled with the biofuels, whilst maintaining acceptable engine stability. This increase, however, is much more dependent on SOI 2 timing than with gasoline, due to the deterioration of in-cylinder mixing and <b>slower</b> <b>combustion.</b> Copyright Â© 2012 SAE International...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new intake port {{configuration}} has been designed, analyzed {{by means of}} 3 D CFD simulation and experimentally tested on a turbocharged Spark Ignition (SI) engine, {{with the aim of}} addressing the issue of the poor in-cylinder turbulence levels which are typical of the Early-Intake-Valve-Closing (EIVC) strategies adopted in Variable Valve Actuation (VVA) systems at part load to reduce pumping losses. The proposed intake port layout promotes turbulence by increasing the tumble motion at low valve lifts in order to achieve a proper flame propagation speed at part load. The new layout was proved to have a significant and positive effect in improving the EGR tolerance and in shortening the combustion process, especially at the lower loads, which are the more critical for VVA systems using an EIVC strategy. However, under full load operating conditions the new design (which enhances the tumble motion at the low valve lifts used at part load, but decreases the tumble intensity under the full lift operation used at full load) did not reach the performance targets, since the knock mitigation was not sufficient to compensate for the loss in combustion efficiency due to the <b>slower</b> <b>combustion.</b> The proposed solution could therefore be exploited only if a reduction of the engine full load performance is allowed in view of the significant benefits during part load operation.

The fireball was created from a 1. 5 liter balloon filled with a propane-oxygen mixture (1 1, the incompletely oxidized products from the primary burn mix with the surrounding air and may be oxidized in a secondary combustion process. The unique feature of the present experiments was a repeatable secondary pressure pulse for sufficiently rich mixtures. The secondary pressure rise was observed repeatably for all initiation configurations. The nature of the secondary pressure pulse is a strong function of the initial equivalence ratio. For [Greek Phi] = 1 and 1. 5, no secondary pressure waves are observed. An acoustic analysis of the measured pressure histories {{has been carried out}} to infer the rate of volume displacement and the total volume displaced by the secondary combustion. The results of the acoustic analysis are in reasonable agreement with both a simplified thermodynamic model predicting the total volume displacement assuming constant-pressure combustion for the secondary burn and the analysis of the fireball luminosity of the high-speed images. For nearly stoichiometric mixtures, [Greek Phi] = 1 and 1. 5, the leading blast wave peak pressures and impulses are comparable with the previously-measured gaseous and high explosive blasts when the energy content of the balloon only is used to formulate Sachs scaling variables.

50|$|The {{generation}} of heat {{in large quantities}} accompanies most explosive chemical reactions. The exceptions are called entropic explosives and include organic peroxides such as acetone peroxide It is the rapid liberation of heat that causes the gaseous products of most explosive reactions to expand and generate high pressures.

For example, although a unit mass of coal yields {{five times as much}} heat as a unit mass of nitroglycerin, the coal cannot be used as an explosive (except in the form of coal dust) because the rate at which it yields this heat is quite slow.
