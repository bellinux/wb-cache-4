50|$|Jacqueline Ayer {{was born}} in New York City to Jamaican parents. Her father Edward Brandford was a graphic artist who founded The Brandford Modeling Agency, the first {{licensed}} African-American agency in the United States. Her mother, Thelma Brandford, was a <b>sample</b> <b>cutter</b> and shop steward for the ILGWU (International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union). Ayer {{grew up in the}} 'Coops', an East Bronx cooperative built for garment workers. She went to the High School of Music & Art in New York and then Syracuse University, followed by the Académie de la Grande Chaumière (drawing), the École Paul Colin (graphics) and the École des Beaux-Arts (painting) in Paris.|$|E
5000|$|Monome devices do {{not produce}} any sound on their own; they must be {{connected}} to a computer via USB, in which an app affords use to the device. The creators of Monome said: [...] "The wonderful thing about this device is that is doesn't do anything really... It wasn't intended for any specific application. We'll make several applications, and others will make more. We hope to share {{as many of these}} as possible." [...] A core design principle of the Monome {{is that it is not}} intended for any one specific application — the function of each button and the decision as to which lights are lit are completely up to the software communicating with the device over the Open Sound Control protocol. The Monome is not strictly a musical device. Depending the software used, the Monome can function as anything from a <b>sample</b> <b>cutter</b> to a math machine.|$|E
30|$|Milled {{ore sample}} {{used for the}} {{investigation}} {{was obtained from the}} BCL concentrator plant. The sample was collected at the cyclone overflow launder feeding the rougher flotation bank, using a <b>sample</b> <b>cutter</b> at 15  min intervals for a period of 2  h. Each time a sample was cut, the density of the pulp was checked for consistency with a density gauge. The total slurry collected, about 33  kg, was stirred and a sample was taken from the bucket, filtered and the residue dried. The dried sample was rolled to break any lumps and then split using a rotary splitter to get representative samples. Sieve analysis of the dry sample was done using √ 2 sieve series from 212 to 38  µm, to establish the feed particle size distribution (PSD) of the ore.|$|E
50|$|Raster passes are {{the most}} basic of all {{machining}} strategies for the finishing or semi-finishing of a part during computer-aided manufacturing (CAM). In raster passes machining the milling cutter moves along curves on the cutter location surface (CL surface) obtained by intersecting the CL surface with vertical, parallel planes. Many CAM systems implement this strategy by <b>sampling</b> <b>cutter</b> location points on these curves by calculating intersection points of the CL surface and as many vertical lines as needed to approximate the curve to the desired accuracy.|$|R
40|$|The author designs an {{up-to-date}} rock cutter for mining {{machines and}} presents a matrix {{to determine its}} service life depending {{on the strength of}} the rock being broken. The dependence of the cutter service life on the strength of the rock being broken is proved. Advanced designs of rock cutters by the leading companies are described. The author develops an original design of a rock cutter which provides greater cutting surface, increased strength and prolonged service life. Pilot <b>samples</b> of the <b>cutters</b> ready to the test run are presented...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to design the {{sampling}} method for collection of phytophilous macroinvertebrates associated with submersed parts of hard emergent littoral vegetation in still waters, which will join technical sampler unpretentiousness, sampling simplicity and maximal quantitative accuracy. For these purposes, we developed a modified Gerking´s frame box <b>sampler</b> with movable <b>cutter</b> for <b>sampling</b> of animals in the littoral macrophyte beds and a new type of core sampler for collection of animals inhabiting the root zone of emergent plant beds. Both sampling devices are suitable for studies targeted on macroinvertebrates monitoring. The comparative sampling using frame box sampler and benthos handnet was performed in the littoral of three carp ponds. The sampling procedure utilizing the frame sampler was more labour demanding however it enabled significantly (P < 0. 05) more efficient collection of slowly moving or sedentary animals...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1967 Sampling {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to compare {{the efficiency of the}} four officially recommended methods of sampling small seeds: automatic sampling [...] at two sampling speeds, hand sampling, Nobbe tier sampling, and stick trier sampling. Synthetic lots of orchard-grass, ryegrass, Kentucky bluegrass, and alfalfa seed were prepared containing known numbers of the common weed and other crop seed contaminants of these species. Samples were taken systematically from each of the synthetic lots by each of the four methods. The samples were analyzed and the results were statistically evaluated using the t-test for individual contaminant analyses and the F-test for total sample contaminant analyses. Automatic sampling was shown to be an accurate method of sampling all the small seed species studied. In addition, the results clearly demonstrate that increasing the <b>sample</b> <b>cutter</b> speed does not affect the accuracy of automatic sampling. Hand sampling and Nobbe tier sampling were less accurate methods of sampling, however, was demonstrated to be an inaccurate method of sampling all the small seeds studied...|$|E
30|$|The {{thickness}} of non-woven fabric was tested with ASTM D 5729 - 97 standard. The tensile properties of non-woven fabric measured according to ASTM standard D 5034. The gram per square meter of fabric {{was measured by}} preparing the <b>sample</b> on GSM <b>cutter</b> and weighing it on electronic weighing balance. The GSM of non-woven fabric tested with ASTM D 3776 - 96 standard. EPI and PPI were measured on one inch pick glass. The crease recovery angle of fabrics was tested on Shirley crease recovery tester. The rectangular specimen of size 2 ″×[*] 1 ″ was prepared and crease recovery angle in degrees were measured. The bending length of fabrics was tested on Eureka stiffness tester. The stiffness of non-woven fabric tested according to ASTM D 5732 - 95 standard. The air permeability of the fabric was measured on FX 3300 Air permeability tester. The air permeability of non-woven fabric tested in accordance with ASTM D 737 - 96 standard. The bursting strength of fabric measured on Eureka bursting strength tester. The bursting strength is tested in accordance with ASTM D 3786 - 87 standard for non-woven fabric.|$|R
40|$|The ship {{breaking}} {{workers are}} exposed to various hazards such as accidents and injuries, exposure to asbestos, heavy metals like lead and polychlorinated biphenyls and noise exposure. The present cross sectional study was carried out to find the pattern and prevalence of health morbidities among ship breaking workers and their associated epidemiological factors. The study included 405 ship-breaking workers. Data collection on pre-designed proforma was followed by complete clinical examination, pulmonary function testing and chest radiography (PA View) of each worker. Blood <b>sample</b> of gas <b>cutters</b> was collected for lead estimation. The study also included audiometry of 187 workers and workplace monitoring for air lead levels. The radiological evaluation showed 12 (2. 96 %) subjects with 1 / 1 and higher opacities whereas the spirometric evaluation revealed 65 (16 %) subjects with obstructive, 6 (1. 5 %) with restrictive and 5 (1. 2 %) with combined type of impairment. The workplace air lead level monitoring revealed normal lead values while 323 (18. 4 %) subjects showed blood lead levels> 30 g/m. The audiometric evaluation of workers suggested normal results for all the workers. The workers in ship breaking {{are exposed to}} dust and lead.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to develop {{guidelines}} for construction of low volume concrete roads in Sri Lanka. A survey was carried out to study current concrete road construction practices and knowledge of the contractors involved in concrete road construction. Survey results show that good practices have not been adopted in low volume road construction in Sri Lanka. The authors have introduced best practices which can be easily adopted by the local road construction industry. Incorrect joints construction was observed in concrete roads during the site visit and the Authors have introduced a new device for contraction joint construction. A modification to the available method was proposed to measure surface undulation on local concrete pavements and allowable undulation was determined through field investigation. A comparison of various kinds of concrete producing and curing methods and their performance were studied. The authors have evaluated the effectiveness of rebound hammer method which has been used for quality control by some consultants. Rebound hammer reading was compared with compressive strength which was found out from core <b>cutter</b> <b>samples.</b> Double beam vibrator with inbuilt camber was introduced to consolidate and form the camber of the surface layer. Check lists for subgrade /subbase, shoulder, formwork and concrete placing and finishing have been introduced to address weakness and enhance the quality of the pavement construction. Quality and Cost control techniques in the field of low volume concrete road construction in Sri Lanka are also described. Further, the proposed guideline describes the most appropriate methods for preparation of subgrade, subbase and shoulder, and mixing, placing and finishing of concrete...|$|R
