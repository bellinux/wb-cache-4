5000|$|September 1, 2000: En {{route to}} aerial display, Helicopter Enstrom F28A bearing {{registration}} N9244 departed Toronto City Centre Airport with a fibreglass moose, known as Bruce the Moose, under hoist. At approximately 100 feet the <b>sling</b> <b>hook</b> failed and the moose {{fell to the}} ground approximately 200 feet from the departure point, just off of airport property. Although Bruce suffered minor damage he was able to perform his duties at the air show.|$|E
50|$|The Sea Stallion has a {{fuselage}} design {{similar to}} the Sikorsky S-61R/Jolly Green Giant series. It has a passenger door {{on the right side}} of the fuselage behind the cockpit and a power-operated rear loading ramp. The fuselage was watertight, though not intended for amphibious use, and only landed on water in emergencies. The Stallion has mechanical flight controls which are backed by three independent hydraulic systems. Armor protects crew and vital systems. The CH-53A carries a crew of four; pilot, copilot, crew chief, and an aerial observer, a load of 38 troops, 24 litters with medical attendants, an internal cargo load of 8000 lb or an external load of 13000 lb on the single-point <b>sling</b> <b>hook.</b> The CH-53A is equipped with a pair of 7.62×51mm NATO M60 machine guns that point out to each side of the fuselage.|$|E
50|$|The CH-46 has a {{cargo bay}} with a rear loading ramp {{that could be}} removed or left open in flight for {{extended}} cargo or for parachute drops. An internal winch is mounted in the forward cabin {{and can be used}} to pull external cargo on pallets into the aircraft via the ramp and rollers. A belly <b>sling</b> <b>hook</b> (cargo hook) which is usually rated at 10000 lb. could be attached for carrying external cargo. Although the hook is rated at 10000 lb., the limited power produced by the engines precludes the lifting of such weight. It usually has a crew of three, but can accommodate a larger crew depending on mission specifics. For example, a Search and Rescue variant will usually carry a crew of five (Pilot, Co-Pilot, Crew Chief, Swimmer, and Medic) to facilitate all aspects of such a mission. A pintle-mounted 0.50 in (12.7 mm) Browning machine gun is mounted {{on each side of the}} helicopter for self-defense. Service in southeast Asia resulted in the addition of armor with the guns.|$|E
25|$|In a fixed-key balafon, {{the keys}} are {{suspended}} by leather straps just above a wooden frame, under which are hung graduated-size calabash gourd resonators. A small hole in each gourd {{is covered with}} a membrane traditionally of thin spider's-egg sac filaments (nowadays more usually of cigarette paper or thin plastic film) to produce the characteristic nasal-buzz timbre of the instrument, which is usually played with two gum-rubber-wound mallets while seated on a low stool (or while standing using a shoulder or waist <b>sling</b> <b>hooked</b> to its frame).|$|R
5000|$|The {{regulations}} define {{lifting equipment}} as [...] "work equipment for lifting or lowering loads and includes its attachments used for anchoring, fixing or supporting it". [...] The regulations involve anything which involves {{the lifting of}} goods or people at work. Equipment covered would include lifts, cranes, ropes, <b>slings,</b> <b>hooks,</b> shackles, eyebolts, rope and pulley systems and forklift trucks. [...] The regulations apply to all workplaces and all {{the provisions of the}} 'Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998' also apply to lifting equipment.|$|R
5000|$|Snap <b>hook</b> <b>sling</b> mount, a {{term for}} several sling mount {{standards}} (i.e. HK-type snap hook or Magpul Paraclip).|$|R
25|$|Harnesses for the timpani were {{originally}} just slings. Corps usually used 2 snare <b>slings</b> and <b>hook</b> {{them around the}} player, and onto his timpani. Some corps rigged wooden blocks between the drum and the player, to help balance issues, as the drums were carried high on the body. Some corps used harnesses for a few years, while some continued using slings.|$|R
40|$|Abstract • Limited {{admissible}} stress {{induced by}} handling {{tools such as}} internal compression due to spreaders etc. The LHC project, collider and experiments, is an assembly of thousands of elements, large or small, heavy or light, fragile or robust. Each element has its own transport requirements that constitute a real challenge to handle. • No lifting points situated above the centre of gravity are generally foreseen, which makes the lifting and handling operations unstable • Lifting points shall be used only with vertical slings (avoid convergence of the <b>slings</b> on crane <b>hook</b> by means of intermediate tools) Even simple manoeuvres could lead to difficulties i...|$|R
60|$|Despite my intense excitement, I {{was calm}} enough to follow directions. But when I struck I felt no weight at all--no {{strain on the}} line. Frantically I wound and jerked--again and again! I never felt him at all. Suddenly my line rose--and then, bewilderingly near the boat, when I was looking far off, the water split with a roar and out shot a huge, gleaming, white-and-purple fish. He blurred in my sight. Down he went with a crash. I wound the reel like a madman, but I never even half got up the slack line. The {{swordfish}} had run straight toward the boat. He leaped again, in a place I did not expect, and going down, instantly came up in another direction. His speed, his savageness, stunned me. I could not judge of his strength, for I never felt his weight. The next leap I saw him <b>sling</b> the <b>hook.</b> It was a great performance. Then that swordfish, finding himself free, leaped for the open sea, and every few yards he {{came out in a}} clean jump. I watched him, too fascinated to count the times he broke water, but he kept it up till he was out of sight on the horizon.|$|R
5000|$|Trent Fitzgerald of PopCrush praised it saying, [...] "The {{collection}} boasts six anthemic tunes {{that should}} get you charged {{for the summer}} months ahead. Standouts include the bombastic song [...] "Money and the Power", the inspiring track [...] "Sunset" [...] and the laid-back remix of [...] "Bad Ass"." [...] The Source said of the EP [...] "What makes this it appealing though is the balance Kid Ink found in allowing listeners into the carefree, TMZ lifestyle he’s caught up in due to his fame and also capturing themes the average person can relate to-grinding everyday to achieve goals." [...] NMB of XXL said, [...] "Throughout the EP, Ink shows confidence in his rhymes and a strong command of his <b>hooks,</b> <b>slinging</b> catchy boasts alongside A$AP Ferg and French Montana on “Bossin’ Up”. Walking the line between singing and rapping on songs like “Fuck Sleep” and “Sunset” Ink’s sound has a distinctly laid-back California feel on the whole." ...|$|R
