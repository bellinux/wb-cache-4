25|$|In the church, {{small changes}} were {{gradually}} implemented by 2010. The previous church benches {{have been replaced}} by folding chairs, which allow a more flexible use of the available space. The present main altar is no longer used for the church services of the centre for meditation meditation and {{has been replaced by a}} small wooden altar, which forms a circle with the folding chairs. <b>Stairlifts</b> or wheelchair ramps have been installed for barrier-free access to the church interior or other premises. The crypt and the rooms of the former parsonage were redesigned for the use as a meditation center.|$|E
50|$|Outdoor <b>Stairlifts</b> {{come with}} seats, perches, footplates or {{platforms}} and are sold worldwide. They {{are similar to}} indoor <b>stairlifts</b> but with improved weatherproofing.|$|E
50|$|These {{come under}} the general {{definition}} of <b>stairlift</b> and are usually of much heavier construction than a domestic <b>stairlift.</b>|$|R
50|$|Codes of {{practice}} and technical specifications apply to <b>stairlift</b> manufacture.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>stairlift</b> chairs {{can also}} be moved and used as indoor wheelchairs.|$|R
50|$|Today, self-installation of <b>stairlifts</b> is {{becoming}} a common trend for people interested in DIY projects. <b>Stairlifts</b> are available for purchase that can be self-installed.|$|E
50|$|These are {{the most}} common type of <b>stairlifts</b> used in private {{dwellings}} with straight stairs and have a straight rail (track) which is attached to the steps of the staircase. Straight-rail <b>stairlifts</b> can usually be installed within days of being ordered and, having a rail which is simply cut to length from a stock part, they are the least expensive <b>stairlifts.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{power rating}} of drive motors for {{domestic}} straight rail <b>stairlifts</b> may be around 250 watts.The power requirement will be greater for heavy loads, very steep inclines, and wheelchair platform <b>stairlifts.</b>|$|E

50|$|The seat of {{a curved}} rail <b>stairlift</b> {{may have to be}} tilted so it remains {{horizontal}} whilst going around curves and negotiates different angles of incline. This requires an additional motor and link system.|$|R
50|$|Some {{manufacturers}} provide curved-rail <b>stairlifts</b> {{made from}} modular parts. These {{have the advantage}} of quick delivery time (the installer brings many parts and picks from them), though the rail may not follow the shape of the stairs as closely as a factory-made stairlift. Modular <b>stairlifts</b> take longer to install that custom-made <b>stairlifts,</b> so they are usually similar in price to a custom-made curved-rail stairlift.|$|E
50|$|More recently, {{domestic}} <b>stairlifts</b> {{have been}} powered from rechargeable batteries and use direct current (DC). One of the selling points {{is that a}} DC stairlift will continue to function during a power outage, provided the batteries are sufficiently charged. Most <b>stairlifts</b> have a 'chargepoint' where the unit will 'park' to charge its batteries. Some straight <b>stairlifts</b> {{have the ability to}} charge continuously no matter where they are left along the track.|$|E
50|$|These {{are made}} to follow {{the shape of an}} {{individual}} staircase (curved stairs). On staircases with intermediate flat landings they eliminate the need for multiple straight <b>stairlifts</b> by providing a continuous ride up {{the entire length of the}} staircase. Because the rail is custom-made to follow the staircase, and because the chair is more complex that on a straight-rail stairlift (it has to be able to remain level while traveling along a track which changes direction and angle), curved-rail <b>stairlifts</b> are usually more costly than <b>stairlifts</b> for straight stairs. Specifying a curved-rail <b>stairlifts</b> usually involves careful measurement, design and manufacturing, and the installation process usually takes longer than for a straight domestic stairlift.|$|E

She sees an old photograph of Hector, Tabitha and Andras as children, but Andras does not look disabled. Katy's friend Shell arrives and plays with Hector's <b>stairlift,</b> sending it upstairs. Katy warns Shell not to break anything, and is startled to see the now-live cat. Katy tries to call her father so she can leave, but the house has no mobile phone signal and the house phone's party line is tied up. As she prepares to leave, the <b>stairlift</b> returns downstairs and Andras's bell rings. Katy is scared of going upstairs, but, at Shell's insistence, the two go to check on him.|$|R
50|$|To ensure {{footbridges}} {{are accessible}} to disabled and other mobility-impaired people, careful consideration is also given to provision of access lifts or ramps, {{as required by}} relevant legislation (e.g. Disability Discrimination Act 1995 in the UK). Some old bridges in Venice are now equipped with a <b>stairlift</b> so that residents with a disability can cross them.|$|R
50|$|<b>Stairlifts</b> {{are largely}} {{operated}} using a {{control on the}} arm of the lift. This is either a switch or a toggle type lever. This larger toggle switch enables users even with limited mobility or painful condition to use <b>stairlifts</b> easily and safely.|$|E
50|$|Some {{manufacturers}} produce <b>stairlifts</b> with trays {{instead of}} seats for moving goods between different levels, usually in commercial or industrial buildings. Some businesses have purchased normal domestic <b>stairlifts</b> purely as goods transporters and put {{items such as}} boxes of stationery on the seat.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>stairlifts</b> {{today are}} {{operating}} using the {{rack and pinion}} system.|$|E
50|$|Most {{swivel seats}} have a safety switch so the <b>stairlift</b> wonâ€™t move unless the seat is locked into its travel position. Special models with seats facing {{the bottom of}} the {{staircase}} have been produced for users with spinal or other conditions which prevent use of the conventional seat layout. More room is need on the landing with these special seats.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>stairlift</b> is a {{mechanical}} device for lifting people {{up and down}} stairs. For sufficiently wide stairs, a rail is mounted to the treads of the stairs.

50|$|Stairs are not {{suitable}} for wheelchairs and other vehicles. A <b>stairlift</b> is a mechanical device for lifting wheelchairs up and down stairs.

50|$|A <b>stairlift</b> is a {{mechanical}} device for lifting people and wheelchairs {{up and down}} stairs. Sometimes special purpose lifts are provided elsewhere to facilitate access for the disabled, for example at entrances to raised bus stops in Curitiba, Brazil (illustrated above). A wheelchair lift is specifically designed to carry the user and the wheelchair. This can either be through floor or utilizing the staircase.|$|R

5000|$|During {{the early}} days of curved rail <b>stairlifts</b> there was no second user market because of the {{difficulty}} of matching rails to a different layout.

Many owners have had to pay to have unwanted curved <b>stairlifts</b> removed.|$|E
