50|$|When {{approaching}} {{by train}} from either direction, <b>point</b> <b>indicators</b> showing the lie of the weighted points {{can be seen}} when the train is approaching Irton Road railway station. The <b>point</b> <b>indicators</b> consist of a light on a black, circular background. A steady white light indicates that the weighted points are set for the train to enter the left-hand line of the two railway lines, while a flashing white light (rarely seen) indicates that the weighted points are set for the train to enter the right-hand line of the two railway lines. Exceptionally, no light illuminated either indicates that the weighted points are incorrectly set for either light-hand or right-hand train movements, or {{that there is some}} power or mechanical failure with the <b>point</b> <b>indicators.</b> These <b>point</b> <b>indicators</b> are normally inactive, only becoming active (illuminating) when a train passes a detection module, located on the track further back from the station than the <b>point</b> <b>indicators.</b>|$|R

Further along the track to the north-east are two sets of points, both controlled by electrical motors activated by lever 11 of the signal frame in the signal cabin. To the south-west of Gill Street are three sets of semi-trailable points - which either can be manually operated or can allow trains through before resetting themselves; three <b>points</b> <b>indicators</b> (black box with white chevrons); and two cable-operated semaphore towers.|$|R

40|$|We {{obtain a}} shaping gain with a {{non-uniform}} probability {{distribution of the}} <b>signal</b> <b>points</b> in a high order signal constellation. To obtain non-equiprobable <b>signal</b> <b>points,</b> we assign a non-uniform amount of distinct bit labels to the <b>signal</b> <b>points.</b> The proposed method is integrated in a bit interleaved coded modulation scheme with iterative demapping and decoding (so called BICM-ID scheme). This iterative process resolves the ambiguities that arise when several bit labels are assigned to one <b>signal</b> <b>point.</b> We derive a greedy algorithm to get a close to optimum probability distribution of the <b>signal</b> <b>points</b> and we use a binary switching algorithm to optimize the bit-mapping. At a rate of 3 bits per channel use, we obtain shaping gains over 1 dB for a 16 ASK signal constellation. In combination with irregular convolutional codes, we achieve an iterative decoding threshold at 0. 7 dB below {{the capacity of the}} uniform distribution. ...|$|R

30|$|The past {{median filter}} {{operates}} on the pixel {{points of the}} image by the same operation method, which causes {{the value of the}} real <b>signal</b> <b>point</b> to change, and the image has a fuzzy problem, so it is not suitable for the system application of this paper. If the true pixel <b>signal</b> <b>point</b> and the <b>signal</b> <b>point</b> contaminated by noise are accurately distinguished, the misoperation of the true pixel <b>signal</b> <b>point</b> can be avoided, and the clarity of the courseware image can be improved. Using the improved switch median filtering method, the pixel of the courseware image can be accurately judged to avoid misoperation of the true pixel <b>signal</b> <b>point.</b> For a pixel of a suspected color image, there is a strong correlation between adjacent points, and the brightness value of a point in the image is close to the brightness value of the adjacent point. The pixel points of the isolated point of the pixel and the image portion of the edge portion are generally considered to be noise points. Therefore, in a courseware image, if there is a large difference between the value of a certain pixel point and its neighborhood value, the correlation between the pixel point and the neighborhood is low, and the point {{is considered to be a}} noise point, which needs to be performed filter processing. If the point value is close to the neighbor value, it is the true <b>signal</b> <b>point.</b>|$|R

40|$|Introduction This Recommendation {{describes}} aspects {{which are}} pertinent to {{and should be}} considered in the design of international signalling networks. Some or all of these aspects may also be relevant to the design of national networks. Some aspects are dealt with for both international and national networks (e. g. availability), others are discussed {{in the context of the}} international network only (e. g. number of <b>signalling</b> transfer <b>points</b> in a <b>signalling</b> relation). A number of aspects require further study for national networks. This Recommendation also gives in Annex A examples of how the signalling network procedures may be applied to the mesh network representation. The national and international networks are considered to be structurally independent and, although a particular <b>signalling</b> <b>point</b> may belong to both networks, <b>signalling</b> <b>points</b> are allocated <b>signalling</b> <b>point</b> codes according to the rules of each network.

In this paper, we focus on the acceleration cycle in the euro area, namely the peaks and troughs of the growth rate which delimitate the slowdown and acceleration phases of the economy. Our aim is twofold: First, we put forward a reference turning point chronology of this cycle on a monthly basis, based on gross domestic product and industrial production index.
