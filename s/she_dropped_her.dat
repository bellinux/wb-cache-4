And here, and in the house of another uncle, Thomas Woolson, she spent the next four years, at Claremont, N. H. At the close of this time, her father gathered his family once more about him, in Oberlin, Ohio, where he afterwards held offices of trust under the United States Government. She joined him at that place, and in 1837 entered Oberlin College which had recently been established there, at first with no thought of taking a college course of study; but, as her perception of its advantages widened, <b>she</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>her</b> desultory work and, preparing herself in the languages, entered the class of 1844, becoming one of the earliest young women who pursued a liberal course of education in a co-educational environment She was then at the head of her father's family and found it necessary to do much of her studying at night. When she neared the close of her junior year, her eyesight failed, and it was many years before she regained substantial use of her eyes. In 1845, she received the degree of AB. in 1845.|$|E

According to Kinne, she last saw Patricia where <b>she</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>her</b> off near the Jones house, speaking to an unknown man in a green 1957 Ford.

Kinne's response was, after leaving Jones, to call John Boldizs and ask him to help her search for Patricia Jones. Shortly before midnight, and within hours of Kinne's conversation with Walter Jones, she and Boldizs had found the body of a woman in a secluded area approximately one mile outside of Independence. According to Boldizs, he had been the one to suggest searching the area in which they encountered the body; it was a spot to which they had often gone on dates before.|$|E

500|$|Eastwood and Locke {{went on to}} star in The Gauntlet, Every Which Way But Loose, Bronco Billy, Any Which Way You Can and Sudden Impact. According {{to former}} {{longtime}} associate Fritz Manes, as quoted by author McGilligan, Eastwood was devoted to her between 1976 and 1980 at the least, but discreetly kept up several [...] "maintenance relationships" [...] (such as with Tunis) during that period. McGilligan claims Eastwood returned to his [...] "habitual womanizing" [...] in the early 1980s, becoming involved with story analyst Megan Rose, actress Jamie Rose (who played a bit part in Tightrope), animal rights activist Jane Brolin (who had intermittent liaisons with Eastwood between the early 1960s and late 1980s) and Jacelyn Reeves, a stewardess he met at the Hog's Breath Inn, among others. He was still living with Locke when he conceived two children with Reeves: a son Scott Eastwood (born Scott Reeves; March 21, 1986) and daughter Kathryn Eastwood (born Kathryn Reeves; February 2, 1988), whose birth certificates both said [...] "Father declined." [...] The affair with Reeves was not reported anywhere until an exposé article {{was published in the}} Star tabloid in 1990. It quoted Reeves as saying [...] "Some family members tell me to file a paternity suit against Clint, but I don't want to." [...] The children continued to be unacknowledged by mainstream news sources {{for more than a decade}} thereafter. Eastwood's relationship with Locke (at the time unaware of his infidelities) ended acrimoniously in April 1989, and the post-breakup litigation dragged on for years. Locke filed a palimony lawsuit against him after he changed the locks on their home and moved her possessions into storage when she was at work filming her second directorial feature, Impulse. In court, Eastwood downplayed the intensity of their relationship. He described Locke as a [...] "roommate" [...] before quickly redescribing her as a [...] "part-time roommate." [...] Locke's estranged brother told The Tennessean that Eastwood still truly loved her, but could no longer take her [...] "addiction" [...] to husband Gordon Anderson. Anticipating that Eastwood was going to misrepresent the marriage, Locke asked Anderson to surrender all claims on any of her assets that as her legal spouse he was entitled to. [...] "In an extraordinary gesture of love and faith in me, Gordon signed away everything without hesitation." [...] During the trial, an investigative journalist contacted Locke and informed her of Eastwood's other family. [...] "I spoke with the nurse in the delivery room, and she confirmed that they are Clint's children. I'll send copies of the birth certificates to you and a photo of Jacelyn, if you want them," [...] Locke quotes the informant. [...] "My mind was still searching to get all his actions lined up. For at least the last four years of our relationship, Clint had been living this double life, going between me and this other woman, and having children with her. Two babies had been born during the last three years of our relationship, and they weren't mine." [...] As the case went on, Locke developed breast cancer and said the treatments sapped her will to fight. <b>She</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>her</b> suit in November 1990 in exchange for a settlement package which included a lump sum plus monthly payments from Eastwood and a $1.5 million directing deal at Warner Bros., but sued him again for fraud in 1995 when she became convinced the deal with Warner was a sham, finally settling out of court in September 1996. Since then, Locke has made discrediting comments about Eastwood.|$|E
