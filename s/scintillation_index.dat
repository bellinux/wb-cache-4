40|$|The {{experimental}} {{estimate of}} radio waves scintillation, caused by plasma density irregularities in the ionosphere, is usually attempted {{by means of}} <b>scintillation</b> <b>indices</b> which are essentially standard deviations of stochasticly fluctuating parts of the received radio wave intensity and phase.

The measurement instrument is a pupil camera from which images are recorded and intensity <b>scintillation</b> <b>index,</b> power <b>scintillation</b> <b>index,</b> probability density function of intensity and intensity correlation width are derived. A preliminary analysis of measurements from three satellite passed is performed, presented and discussed. The intensity <b>scintillation</b> <b>index</b> ranges from ~ 0. 25 to ~ 0. 03 within elevations of 26 to 66 deg. Power <b>scintillation</b> <b>index</b> varies from ~ 0. 08 to ~ 0. 006 and correlation width of intensity between ~ 11 and ~ 3 cm.

The turbulence is generated by the short‐term fluctuations in the electric field imposed on the polar cap ionosphere by electric field mapping from the magnetosphere. The model uses an ionospheric imaging algorithm to specify the state of the ionosphere throughout. The growth rates are used to estimate mean amplitudes for the irregularities, and these mean amplitudes are compared with observations of the <b>scintillation</b> <b>indices</b> S 4 and s by calculating the linear correlation coefficients between them. The scintillation data are recorded by GPS L 1 band receivers stationed at high northern latitudes. A total of 13 days are analyzed, covering four separate magnetic storm periods.

The analysis indicates that the correlation coefficient between ROTI and S (4) /sigma (I broken vertical bar) is about 0. 6 if data from all GPS satellites are used together. If each individual satellite is considered, the correlation coefficients are above 0. 6 on average and sometimes above 0. 8. The analysis also shows that the ratio of ROTI and S (4) varies between 1 and 4. The ratio ROTI/sigma (I broken vertical bar), varies between 2 and 9. In addition, it is also found {{that there is a}} good consistency between the temporal variations of ROTI with scintillation activity under different ionospheric conditions. ROTI has a high correlation relationship with <b>scintillation</b> <b>indices</b> on geomagnetically disturbed days or in solar active months.

Such receivers are able to measure the amount of scintillation affecting a satellite signal in both amplitude and phase by making use of correlation data from the tracking processing blocks. This is normally done by computing two indices: the S 4 for amplitude scintillation and the phase deviation due to scintillations [3]. However, as more telecommunication systems are likely to work in frequency bands close to GNSS signals in the next years, monitoring of scintillation activity might be threatened by the presence of Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) in the operation area.

40|$|Gaussian {{distribution}} {{is used to}} describe the power law along the propagation path and phase screen of the non-Kolmogorov turbulence is proposed based on the equivalent refractive-index structure constants. Various simulations of Gaussian beam propagation in Kolmogorov and non-Kolmogorov turbulence are used for telling the difference between isotropic and anisotropic turbulence. The results imply that the non-Kolmogorov turbulence makes a great influence on the simulations via power law in spectrum and the number of phase screens. Furthermore, the influence is mainly reflected in light intensity and beam drift. Statistics suggest that when Gaussian beam propagate through single phase screen of non-Kolmogorov, maximum and uniformity of light intensity increase first and then decrease with power law, and beam drift firstly increases and then to stabilize. When Gaussian beam propagate through multiple phase screens, relative errors of beam drift decrease with the number of phase screens.
