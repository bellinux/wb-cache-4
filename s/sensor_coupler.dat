Recent developments of the UV writing technique at Southampton have allowed the realisation of high quality Bragg gratings in silica-on-silicon by simultaneous writing of the channel waveguides and gratings (the direct grating writing technique). This approach together with wavelength detuning, allows an unprecedented range of wavelengths to be written under software control.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{demonstrate}} a simple design of a fiber optic displacement sensor using a multimode plastic fiber coupler based on reflective intensity modulation technique. Design/methodology/approach – The performances of this sensor are investigated by correlating the detector output with different light sources, coupling ratios and various real objects with different reflectivity properties namely aluminum, brass and copper. In contrast to the output profile produced by probes with multiple fibers placed adjacently together, this sensor uses only one fiber for sending and receiving the light and therefore only the back slope exists. Findings – Aluminum exhibit the highest performance among the real objects when coupled with a red He-Ne laser and a coupling ratio of 50 : 50 with a sensitivity, linear range, resolution and dynamic range of 1. 7 mV/mm, 1. 5 mm, 16 m m, and 5. 0 mm, respectively.

40|$|A biosensoric {{approach}} has been developed to determine the activity of telomerase in tumor cell lysates. An optical <b>sensor,</b> the grating <b>coupler,</b> was used to monitor the association and dissociation of unlabeled compounds on the sensor surface in real time, by virtue of an evanescent field. An oligonucleotide was immobilized {{on the surface of}} the optical biosensor and linked with two other oligonucleotides by complementary sequences in an overlapping manner. The 3 '-end of the last one carried the sequence of the telomeric substrate (TS) primer used for elongation by telomerase in the telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay. This primer sequence was phosphorothioate (PS) -modified, which is known to strongly increase the affinity to the primer binding site of telomerase protein and consequently the velocity of the telomerase reaction. We show that the PS primer binds to the modified biosensor and is elongated effectively by the telomerase from HL- 60 cell lysates. A synthesis rate of 1 nucleotide/min was determined. The inhibitory effect of peptide nucleic acid (PNA) was shown by using immobilized TS. The velocity of the telomerase reaction was slowed down and the signal intensity was below the signal-to-noise ratio. Most nucleic acid detection systems use amplification steps such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to increase the amount of the probe. Since telomerase is a polymerase itself amplification of DNA by PCR is not required. Furthermore, no purification steps were required since all measurements were performed with crude cell extract...|$|R
40|$|On-line partial {{discharge}} (PD) detection for {{high voltage cable}} systems is important as it ensures that possible faults can be detected and remedied before catastrophic failure occurs. Of growing interest {{is the use of}} non-conventional field coupling techniques to detect PD signals and the VHF capacitive <b>coupler</b> <b>sensor</b> is finding increasing application in PD detection systems due to its low cost, reliability and applicability to online detection. However, it has a major disadvantage as {{it is very difficult to}} quantify the sensor output voltage in terms of the conventional PD quantity, apparent charge. Proposed methods rely on pulse injection either at the cable termination or via another coupler in order to obtain a calibration ratio, these approaches have been assessed experimentally. In addition, frequency response (FR) measurements have been taken and used to generate a transfer function relating the coupler output to signals present on the cable core conductor. The transfer function has been used as the central component of a simulation model that estimates the calibration ratio. Good agreement has been achieved between the simulation model output and experimental results. PD tests have also been undertaken on a section of 66 kV HV cable, containing an earthed needle within the cable dielectric. Obtained results have been compared with measurements using the conventional electrical detection method. Results indicate that a better estimation of reduced charge is possible using a frequency response measurement to provide coefficients for a simulation model than existing pulse injection calibration methods...|$|R
40|$|M. Ing. This thesis {{covers the}} theory and {{development}} of fused, biconically tapered, fibre-optic couplers and their application in sensors. The optical coupling between fibres is described {{by means of the}} coupled-mode theory {{in the case of a}} weakly guiding coupler. Firstly, simplified expressions for the guided modes in an optical fibre are derived. This is followed by the derivation of the coupled-mode equations for a perturbed waveguide. The coupled-mode equations are then used, together with the expressions for the guided modes, to determine the coupling coefficient for a weakly guiding coupler. In the case where the coupler is not weakly guiding, a model based on a rectangular dielectric waveguide is presented. A process for the manufacture of fibre-optic couplers, based on the fusion and elongation technique, was developed. This process is described and special attention is paid to the influence which different process parameters has on the properties of the couplers. During the development, the coupling theory was utilized to optimize the process. Results obtained with couplers manufactured by this process, are presented. A specific application of couplers, namely a new type of fibre-optic <b>coupler</b> <b>sensor,</b> was developed. The operation of the sensor relies on the change of the coupling ratio with an axially applied mechanical strain. Analog signal processing of the two outputs yields a signal which is directly proportional to the strain and which is independent of fluctuations of the light source power. The sensor was investigated experimentally by manufacturing temperature and elongation sensors which work on this principle. The operation and features of these sensors are presented, together with very promising experimental results...|$|R
40|$|Following the {{intensive}} development of isolated (i. e., not coupled with on-chip waveguide) vertically rolled-up microtube ring resonators (VRU-MRRs) for both active and passive applications, {{a variety of}} microtube-based devices has been realized. These include microcavity lasers, optical <b>sensors,</b> directional <b>couplers,</b> and active elements in lab-on-a-chip devices. To provide more advanced and complex functionality, the focus of tubular geometry research is now shifting toward (i) refined vertical light transfer in 3 D stacks of multiple photonic layers and (ii) to make microfluidic cooling system in the integrated optoelectronic system. Based on this motivation, this PhD research {{is devoted to the}} demonstration and the implementation of monolithic integration of VRU-MRRs with photonic waveguides for 3 D photonic integration and their optofluidic applications. Prior to integration, high-quality isolated VRU-MRRs on the flat Si substrate are firstly fabricated by the controlled release of differentially strained titanium-dioxide (TiO 2) bilayered nanomembranes. The fabricated microtubes support resonance modes for both telecom and visible photonics. The outcome of the isolated VRU-MRRs is a record high Q (≈ 3. 8 × 10 ^ 3) in the telecom wavelength range with optimum tapered optical fiber resonator interaction. To further study the optical modes in the visible and near infrared spectral range, μPL spectroscopy is performed on the isolated VRU-MRRs, which are activated by entrapping various sizes of luminescent nanoparticles (NPs) within the windings of rolled-up nanomembranes based on a flexible, robust and economical method. Moreover, it is realized for the first time, in addition to serving as light sources that NPs-aggregated in isolated VRU-MRRs can produce an optical potential well {{that can be used to}} trap optical resonant modes. After achieving all the required parameters for creating a high-quality TiO 2 VRU-MRR, the monolithic integration of VRU-MRRs with Si nanophotonic waveguides is experimentally demonstrated, exhibiting a significant step toward 3 D photonic integration. The on-chip integration is realized by rolling up 2 D pre-strained TiO 2 nanomembranes into 3 D VRU-MRRs on a microchip which seamlessly expanded over several integrated waveguides. In this intriguing vertical transmission configuration, resonant filtering of optical signals at telecom wavelengths is demonstrated based on ultra-smooth and subwavelength thick-walled VRU-MRRs. Finally, to illustrate the usefulness of the fully integrated VRU-MRRs with photonic waveguides, optofluidic functionalities of the integrated system is investigated. In this work, two methods are performed to explore optofluidic applications of the integrated system. First, the hollow core of an integrated VRU-MRR is uniquely filled with a liquid solution (purified water) by setting one end of the VRU-MRRs in contact with a droplet placed onto the photonic chip via a glass capillary. Second, the outside of an integrated VRU-MRR is fully covered with a big droplet of liquid. Both techniques lead to a significant shift in the WGMs (Δλ≈ 46 nm). A maximum sensitivity of 140 nm/refractive index unit, is achieved. The achievements of this PhD research open up fascinating opportunities for the realization of massively parallel optofluidic microsystems with more functionality and flexibility for analysis of biomaterials in lab-on-a-tube systems on single chips. It also demonstrates 3 D photonic integration in which optical interconnects between multiple photonic layers are required...|$|R
