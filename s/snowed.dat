5|$|Faced {{with one}} last push over {{mountains}} that {{were described as}} much worse than the Wasatch, the ragtag company had {{to decide whether to}} forge ahead or rest their cattle. It was October 20 and they had been told that the pass would not be <b>snowed</b> in until the middle of November. William Pike was killed when a gun being loaded by William Foster was discharged negligently, an event that seemed to make the decision for them; family by family, they resumed their journey, first the Breens, then Kesebergs, Stanton with the Reeds, Graveses, and Murphys. The Donners waited and traveled last. After a few miles of rough terrain, an axle broke on one of the Donners' wagons. Jacob and George went into the woods to fashion a replacement. George Donner sliced his hand open while chiseling the wood, but it seemed a superficial wound.|$|E

Upon his return to Genoa City, he believes that Cassie is alive {{and that he is}} still married to Sharon and kisses her, intent on winning her back. However, soon his memory returns, and he reunites with Phyllis and Summer. Jack, Phyllis, Nick and Sharon soon start a business venture, creating a new magazine entitled Restless Style. However, the four constantly clash, and Jack and Sharon are driven out of the company. However, Nick and Sharon grow closer. While in Paris searching for a teenage Noah, Nick and Sharon share a kiss on the bridge, which is witnessed by Phyllis. Back in Genoa City, Nick and Sharon are <b>snowed</b> in at the Abbott cabin and end up making love. Their emotional affair continues, and they sleep together a second time three months later. This results in Sharon's pregnancy. She gives birth to Faith Newman in September 2009. She is stolen by Nick's brother Adam Newman at birth, presumed dead for months. Faith is eventually returned to her parents, after Sharon developed a relationship and married a manipulative Adam, unaware of his actions. Nick's marriage to Phyllis is over by this point.|$|E

This study investigated the differences between artificial <b>snow</b> and natural <b>snow</b> in two adjacent ski slopes.

For more general conclusions, I think it is important to study the vegetation under artificial <b>snow</b> during a longer period and in several areas...|$|R

In dry <b>snow</b> conditions, forest coverage and <b>snow</b> density are the two major error parameters in passive microwave <b>snow</b> mapping. The error on <b>snow</b> water equivalence estimation is directly proportional to the error in estimated <b>snow</b> density and forest coverage. For Quebec, ignoring the fraction of the forest cover may cause up to 49 % <b>snow</b> depth or water equivalence underestimation.
