A case study is presented <b>of</b> a reciprocal <b>secondment</b> between a government department and a university. Enablers of knowledge translation included flexibility and support, a prior relationship between the two organisations, and a government culture that values use of research in policy making. Barriers included the lack of a planned approach with agreed outcomes, and a lack of evaluation at the end <b>of</b> the <b>secondment.</b> Recommendations for future secondments include establishing ongoing secondments between organisations; trialling different types of secondments; and having a detailed plan at the beginning <b>of</b> a <b>secondment,</b> including how the success <b>of</b> the <b>secondment</b> will be measured, and a formal evaluation at the end...|$|R

To achieve the objectives of this paper, it has been divided into five parts. The first part is the theoretical framework of the issue in which we address the importance <b>of</b> <b>secondment</b> <b>of</b> personnel {{in the public sector}} in Saudi Arabia. Then I will review the concept and importance <b>of</b> the <b>secondment</b> <b>of</b> personnel in general. In the second part we will review several international experiences, while in the third part, we will focus on the current reality <b>of</b> the <b>secondment</b> regulations applied in Saudi Arabia. In the fourth part, we will analyze the current situation by identifying strengths and weaknesses in the <b>secondment</b> regulation <b>of</b> the personnel in Saudi Arabia. Finally, the study will propose a policy to activate, coordinate and encourage the <b>secondment</b> <b>of</b> personnel in Saudi Arabia. It is worth mentioning that the paper concluded that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia devoted a regulation for the <b>secondment</b> <b>of</b> personnel both within and outside Saudi Arabia, through the public sector personnel may be seconded to some government, regional or international bodies. However, within the Kingdom does not allowed to second the public sector personnel except for some government agencies that have special private system and this deprives several government agencies {{to take advantage of the}} unique experiences in some government agencies. In addition, I will suggest new regulations that will allow private sector to second their employees to government agencies. In conclusion there is a need to develop the secondment regulation to allow the <b>secondment</b> <b>of</b> the government agencies personnel among them, regardless of being a ministry or a public institution, as there is an urgent need to add regulatory articles for the secondment to second Saudi employees working in the private sector to various government agencies through the <b>secondment</b> <b>of</b> their services for specific periods such as four years as an example along with providing them with financial incentives to encourage their services secondment...|$|R

40|$|It {{is common}} {{practice}} in university faculties of education to second teachers for limited periods. However, few recent studies have examined how secondees perceive themselves in this role, particularly {{in relation to the}} increased demands to assume research as well as teaching duties. Three seconded school personnel were interviewed to explore their experiences <b>of</b> <b>secondment</b> in a faculty of education in Canada. One had previously been a teacher, one an educational consultant, and the third a principal. Qualitative data analysis revealed (a) the differences between schools and faculty; (b) the benefits <b>of</b> <b>secondment</b> for secondees and the institution; (c) secondees' identity as teachers; (d) secondees' mixed feelings about research; and finally (e) the drawbacks and issues in being seconded.

40|$|Background - Experiential {{approaches}} to skills development using secondment models are shown to benefit healthcare organisations more generally, but {{little is known}} about the potential of this approach to develop capacity for knowledge translation (KT). Aim - To evaluate the success of KT capacity development secondments from the perspective of multiple stakeholders. Methods - A pluralistic evaluation design was used. Data were collected during 2011 - 12 using focus group and individual interviews with 14 clinical and academic secondees, and five managers from host and seconding organisations to gain insight into participants’ perceptions of the success <b>of</b> <b>secondments</b> and the criteria by which they judged success. Six After Action Reviews were undertaken with KT project teams to explore participants’ perceptions of the contribution secondees made to KT projects. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with three healthcare managers on completion of projects to explore the impact <b>of</b> <b>secondments</b> on the organisation, staff and patients. Qualitative content analysis was used to identify criteria for success. The criteria provided a framework through which the overall success <b>of</b> <b>secondments</b> could be judged. Results - Six criteria for judging the success <b>of</b> the <b>secondments</b> at individual, team and organisation level were identified: KT skills development, effective workload management, team working, achieving KT objectives, enhanced care delivery, enhanced education delivery. Benefits to the individual, KT team, seconding and host organisations were identified. Implications for practice - Hosting teams should provide mentorship support to secondees, and be flexible to accommodate secondees’ needs as team members. On-going support of managers from seconding organisations is needed to maximise the benefits to individual secondees and the organisation. Conclusions - Experiential {{approaches to}} KT capacity development using secondments can benefit individual secondees, project teams, seconding and host organisations. </p...|$|R

Some, on the other hand, argue that `partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' should be "balanced" with the criminal responsibility of the offender, which is {{greater than that of}} those whose execution of the sentence is fully suspended and is smaller than that of those whose sentence is partially executed. However, I think that this method of judgment ignores the requirements of Article 27 - 2, simply imposing the `penalty' in the community, which has no desirable effect on the offender's rehabilitation. Furthermore, such method of judgment might assign a longer `penalty' to the offender whose sentence had been fully executed with short or no parole term, because of his/her criminal responsibility. In this paper, I reconsider the discussion on `partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' and `full <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' in order to clarify the image of those whose sentence is `partially suspended' under Article 27 - 2.
