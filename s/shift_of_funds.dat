40|$|This paper {{examines}} two {{educational policy}} changes in New York state: performance standards, which {{are designed to}} boost performance, particularly in troubled districts; and school property tax relief, {{which is designed to}} offset the state�s high property tax burden. Our analysis pays particular attention to variation in educational costs across districts and to school districts � responses to policy change. A school district�s performance can be moved toward a standard by improving the district�s efficiency, increasing the district�s property tax rate, or increasing the district�s state aid. We find that raising efficiency up to the current �best-practice � level would not be sufficient to bring many districts up to even minimal performance standards. Moreover, without increases in aid or efficiency, many districts could not reach performance standards without a dramatic increase in their tax rate. In principle, a performance-based foundation aid system could help low-performing districts reach a standard. However, New York City currently receives so little aid, despite its relatively high costs and low wealth, that such an aid system would require a major <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> to the City and, without {{a significant increase in the}} state aid budget, would result in a significan...|$|E

This paper exploits this episode as a natural experiment to investigate the crowding-out effects of a government-owned depository institution on local economies. The panel data of 47 prefectures from 1995 to 2004 show that the prefectures where local funds were heavily invested in the postal saving system in the early 1990 s tended to experience a larger <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> into private banks from the postal saving system in the early 2000 s, suggesting that the exogenous maturing of PSCs was in part responsible for the observed shifts in the allocation of local funds. More importantly, the (instrumented) flow of local funds to private banks from the postal saving system has statistically robust and economically important positive effects on local output and on the number of small firms, but not on the number of large firms. These results provide empirical support for the view that a government-owned depository institution has crowding-out effects on local economies and, in particular, on small firms that rely on local banks in direct competitio...|$|E
40|$|M. Com. (Economics) Access {{to health}} care is a basic human right in South Africa. Primary health care is viewed by the South African {{government}} as the means to improving access {{to health care}} in the country. The concept of primary health care is based on the importance of first contact with a primary health worker. The Department of Health introduced free primary health care because it believes that the most significant barrier to access to health care is poverty. When a service is provided for free there is no income generated from user fees and the issue of funding becomes very important. This study performs an analysis of the free primary health care programme in South Africa and how it is financed. An important feature that characterizes South Africa is high inequality which is reflected in the high level ofpreventable diseases as well as high incidents of chronic diseases. The implementation of free primary health care has led to improved access to health care and somewhat improved the health status of the South African population. In order to address the inequalities in the health sector there must be funding targeted towards the needs of the poor. Government's fiscal policy places limits on the expansion of public expenditure, which poses a strain on resources flowing to the health sector. In addition to that {{there has not been a}} significant <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> from higher levels of care to primary health care.

40|$|It is well {{documented}} that motor vehicle crashes are a public safety concern. However, traditional approaches do not always lend themselves to addressing the complete extent of this 2 ̆ 2 safety problem 2 ̆ 2. Identifying {{the extent of the}} 2 ̆ 2 safety problem 2 ̆ 2 is an important step in optimizing safety fund allocation and analyzing horizontal curve safety. This study investigates the allocation of safety expenditures in Iowa, relative to crash data. The matching of crash data with safety expenditures suggests the <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> from the high crash density, state system to facilities on the low density, local system. However, the redistribution of funding should also consider factors such as crash density and benefit cost. Furthermore, because some crashes are too widely distributed to be identified using traditional high crash location methodology; a balance of systematic and high crash location methods should be considered. Ultimately, the optimum balance of safety resources should reduce the most possible fatal and serious injury crashes. This study also investigated a systematic method for identifying and estimating geometric parameters on horizontal curves. A validation of this method showed that as horizontal curve radius decrease, sensitivity to errors in the estimated curve radius increase. Although some large errors associated with the estimated curve radius were found, predicted crash frequency for all curves was found to be no more than twenty percent different than the actual predicted crash frequency. Lastly, safety performance functions created for the horizontal curve database did not yield a concrete correlation between curve radius and crash frequency. Because of the random nature of fatal and major injury crashes, care is advised when creating crash models for these crashes...|$|E

40|$|This {{study of}} one region {{is in many}} ways {{relevant}} for others. In 1994, {{at the request of the}} Regional Alliance for Transit (RAFT), the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) used RAFT's assumptions in a run of its computer model of land use and transportation for the nine counties of the San Francisco, California, region. The RAFT run assumed the same population and employment growth for 2010 as MTC. RAFT assumptions combined a pricing reform, land use changes, and a <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> from freeways to transit. The pricing reform was to, in effect, pay employees the value of their "free" parking at work if they did not use it. The land use changes were to stop growth in the green belt and to revitalize neighborhoods and industries in transit-served areas. Funds were shifted from freeways to CalTrain upgrades, commuter rail, light rail, express bus services and local buses. RAFT proposed only three highway projects: one was to test against a competing freeway proposed in Hayward; a second for the I- 238 bottleneck, and the third for Route 4 in Contra Costa. Regionally, performance was measured using many indices. For the Hayward project, it was measured in terms of mode choice, of level of service on highways, and of BART ridership. The RAFT plan performed significantly better than MTC's Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) on all measures regionally and in Hayward. MTC claimed it could not implement the RAFT plan, and RAFT responded to MTC. Despite limitations on its powers, MTC can still condition funding for transportation projects on land use, and can plan on the basis of market-based pricing reform and transit supported by land use and pricing reform. The problem is MTC's willingness to use the powers it has, which depends, in turn, on support from local governments. ...|$|E
40|$|Using a {{quasi-experimental}} time-series {{design and}} employing a multiple regression technique, {{we examined the}} fiscal impacts and redistributive effects of the recently enacted federal education block grant on Michigan's 525 K- 12 school districts. Two important policy questions were addressed: Are resource allocations for targeted school districts likely {{to be affected by}} the adoption of different federal grant mechanisms? If so, will there be a shifting of resources away from or toward these districts? We found that the movement to the block grant mechanism resulted in a definite <b>shift</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> away from former Emergency School Aid Act (ESAA) districts, districts with high proportions of poverty children, highly urbanized districts, and large districts toward smaller and rural districts. The implications of these changes in federal policy are discussed. Early in the Reagan administration, the Congress enacted the Education Consolida-tion and Improvement Act of 1981 (ECIA, 1981). Chapter 2 of this act called for the consolidation into a single block grant of 28 prior categorical programs, most of which were relatively small competitive grant pro-grams. The two largest programs consoli-dated under the block grant were Title IV-B of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), which provided funds to both public and private schools on a formula basis to purchase materials, equipment, and li-brary resources; and the Emergency School Aid Act (ESAA), which provided assistance to school districts undergoing desegregation. In contrast with the wide distribution of Title IV-B funds, ESAA funds had been concen-trated for the most part on large urban dis-tricts. The Administration contended that the block grant would substantially reduce the burden that results from federal intervention and regulations, that it would return to the states considerable decision-making power and flexibility in programming, and that ulti-mately it would be a much more effective and efficient way to deliver federal education funds to the states and to local districts.

40|$|Introduction One {{issue in}} the {{argument}} about the merits of pegged and oating exchange rates involves the magnitude of transactions costs in the foreign exchange market under alternative exchange rate regimes. The higher the transactions costs, the greater the deterrence to international trade.

We {{assume that the}} asset's return follows an auto-regressive model and use long-term investment growth as the objective of a market timing strategy which entails the <b>shifting</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> between a risky asset and a riskless asset. We give the optimal trading strategy for a finite investment horizon, and analyze its limiting behavior. For a finite horizon, the optimal decision in each step depends on two threshold values. If the return today is between the two values, nothing needs to be done, otherwise funds will be shifted from one asset to another, depending on which threshold value is being exceeded. When investment horizon tends to infinity, the optimal strategy converges to a stationary policy, which is shown to be closely related to a well-known technical trading rule, called Momentum Index trading rule. An integral equation of the two threshold values is given. Numerical results for the limiting stationary strategy are presented. The results confirm the obvious guess that the no-transaction region increases as the transaction cost increase. Finally, the limiting stationary strategy is applied to data in the Hang Seng Index Futures market in Hong Kong. The out-of-sample performance of the limiting stationary strategy {{is found to be}} better than the simple strategy used in literature, which is based on an 1 -step ahead forecast of return.

In addition, we also look at the components of, as well as interrelationship among, these variables. Annual data from 1949 - 50 to 1998 - 99 are used and the period is further divided into five decades. The analyses show a greater expansion in these variables in the 1970 s. However, these expansions can be attributed to phenomenal expansions in prices. Real income, on the other hand, improved marginally. Real income expanded significantly in the 1960 s and remained stable till the 1980 s but significantly declined in the 1990 s. This is an alarming situation and requires suitable remedial measures. Similarly, the analyses show a significant decline in NFI in the 1990 s. In fact, it has been negative {{for the last four years}} indicating capital outflow from the country which is also alarming. The analyses also indicate a significant difference between measures of money, M 1 and M 2, in the 1990 s due to the opening of foreign currency deposits.

Officials reported they had discretion to reallocate one third <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> and nearly one half of staff time. Multivariate OLS analyses did not support our hypothesis that higher proportions of revenues from local sources would be associated with higher discretion in allocation. Bivariate analyses indicated a positive association between discretion and the ability to meet community needs. Focus group participants shared concerns about economic and emotional burdens associated with social distancing measures, including fear of job loss due to illness or school closure. Many objected to closing religious institutions and expressed distrust of government. Groups did not reach consensus on allocation of scarce resources, but they did emphasize fairness. They made utilitarian and egalitarian arguments for giving priority to the most vulnerable, children, and those who could keep society functioning. Some expressed public-spirited attitudes and showed capacity for deliberation. Together, the findings from these studies suggest that officials’ discretion in allocation may be important in meeting community needs and that deliberation may be useful in gauging community support, eliciting community concerns, and garnering public trust. Future research should focus on collecting accurate revenue and expenditure data, producing evidence of effectiveness, and supporting needs assessments prior to allocation...|$|R
40|$|One {{issue in}} the {{argument}} about the merits of pegged and floating exchange rates involves the magnitude of transactions costs in the foreign exchange market under alternative exchange rate regimes. The higher the transactions costs, the greater the deterrence to international trade. Moreover, the higher these costs, the greater the scope for national monetary independence, and more fully the monetary authority in one country could follow policies that might cause the rates of return on assets denominated in its currency to di‹er from rates of return on comparable assets denominated in other currencies, for any given impact in inducing flows of short-term capital. In contrast, the lower the transactions costs in the foreign exchange market, the more the case for national monetary independence must rest on other deterrents to the <b>shifts</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> among national financial centers, such as uncertainty about changes in exchange rates. Transactions costs in the foreign exchange market are not explicit, as in the markets with stan- dardized commissions like the home real estate market and organized security and commodity exchanges. Instead, transactions costs are implicit, as in the over-the-counter security market, and are collected by broker-dealers, primarily the large commercial banks, in the spreads between the prices at which they buy and sell foreign exchange. The transactions costs in the foreign exchange market may di‹er by the pair of currencies involved, {{by the size of}} the transaction, by the customer buying the foreign exchange, by the bank selling the foreign exchange, and even by the center in which a particular transaction such as the purchase of dollars with sterling occurs. However, from the point of view providing insights about the scope for monetary independence, the key consider- ation is the estimate of transactions costs incurred by those who pay the lowest costs – the banks in their transactions with each other. The next section discusses previous approaches to the measurement of transactions costs in the foreign exchange market. Then a new approach to estimate the transactions costs using futures prices is presented...|$|R
