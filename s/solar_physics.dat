40|$|We {{advocate}} the extraterrestrial <b>solar</b> neutrino <b>physics</b> (etSNP) {{as a means}} of investigating <b>solar</b> neutrino <b>physics</b> (SNP). As we already know, the dominant and subdominant (vacuum) oscillation lengths would be approximately one kilometer and one hundred kilometers. On the other hand, we know so far that the matter-enhanced oscillations take place only in the core of the Sun. Thus, the etSNP, i. e. <b>solar</b> neutrino <b>physics</b> that could be extracted outside the Earth, would assume a special unique role. The etSNP experiments include (1) a satellite (detector) around the Earth or around the Jupiter or others (to provide the shadow, for the matter-enhanced neutrino oscillations), (2) during the Sun-Venus-Earth eclipse or similar, and (3) the chemical compositions of the geology type (as in the Jupiter or in the Venus, to study the origins of these planets). To be specific, we note that the reactions induced by the ^ 8 B solar neutrinos, in view of the sole high energy nature (E_ν^max= 14. 03 MeV), would be most interesting in the solar environment. Moreover, the experiments such as the chemical compositions of the geology type (on the Venus or Jupiter) and the matter-enhanced oscillations when the Sun-Venus-Earth eclipse, or the Sun-Mercury-Earth eclipse, may also be interesting...|$|R
2500|$|According to David Shayler, Lind [...] "could never {{understand}} why he {{was not on the}} [...] crew as cience ilot" [...] due to his work on the mission's Earth resources package; this could likely be attributed to seniority and specialization, as all of the Science Pilots were drawn from Group 4 and Skylab 4 Science Pilot Edward Gibson (like Lind, an atmospheric physicist) had taken on an additional research program in <b>solar</b> <b>physics</b> and worked on the Apollo Telescope Mount while Lind was still on track to be assigned to a lunar mission. Although he cross-trained with Lenoir and briefly proposed swapping positions with his crewmate, he elected to retain his original assignment due to the greater likelihood of the rescue mission (which could only accommodate the Commander and Pilot) amid the space program's dwindling flight opportunities.|$|E

2500|$|To {{shape the}} science of the film, Boyle and Garland hired {{scientific}} advisers, including NASA employees and astrophysicists. Brian Cox, a professor of particle physics at the University of Manchester, was hired to advise {{the cast and crew}} after the director had seen Cox on the science TV series Horizon. Cox gave regular lectures to the film's cast members about <b>solar</b> <b>physics,</b> and also advised the filmmakers to scale down the nuclear device in the film from the mass of the Moon to the size of Manhattan. In the film's backstory, a Q-ball enters and is caught in the Earth's Sun, and begins to eat it away. According to Cox, the Sun would not be dense enough in real life to stop a Q-ball, but filmmakers took creative licence in writing the backstory. Cox noted in the DVD commentary that several inaccuracies were permitted to allow for plot. He also dismissed criticisms of the film by scientists: [...] "Sunshine is not a documentary. It's trying to just, in an hour and forty minutes, get across a feeling of what it's like – not only to be a scientist, because obviously there's much more in it than that. So, I found it interesting to watch the kind of people that get upset because the gravity is wrong." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{opposition}} to this view, some historians of science, including non-Catholics such as J.L. Heilbron, A.C. Crombie, David Lindberg, Edward Grant, Thomas Goldstein, and Ted Davis, {{have argued that}} the Church had a significant, positive influence on the development of Western civilization. They hold that, not only did monks save and cultivate the remnants of ancient civilization during the barbarian invasions, but that the Church promoted learning and science through its sponsorship of many universities which, under its leadership, grew rapidly in Europe in the 11th and 12th centuries. Copernicus, Galileo Galilei, and Johannes Kepler all considered themselves Christian. St.Thomas Aquinas, the Church's [...] "model theologian," [...] argued that reason is in harmony with faith, and that reason can contribute to a deeper understanding of revelation, and so encouraged intellectual development.
