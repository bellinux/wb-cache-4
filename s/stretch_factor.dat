40|$|With {{deep sea}} {{petroleum}} explorations {{become more and}} more popular, some geological phenomena have emerged: extension of lower crust and upper crust is inhomogeneous; shelf break has been moved rapidly after crustal stretching. These geological phenomena are important to the continental margin evolution. To investigate the thinning of the whole crust and the contribution of the upper crust versus the lower crust to the crustal stretching since the Cenozoic, we calculated the <b>stretching</b> <b>factors</b> of the upper and the lower crust based on the 13 seismic lines in the Baiyun Sag from CNOOC. The results indicated that the whole crustal thickness decreases seaward while the whole crustal <b>stretching</b> <b>factor</b> increases from shelf to slope. Our calculations showed that the lower crustal <b>stretching</b> <b>factor</b> is higher than that of the upper crust in the Baiyun Sag. In the Cenozoic, deformation of the Baiyun Sag is controlled mainly by ductile shearing rather than brittle shearing. Based on the numerical modeling, we can conclude the initial crust in the Baiyun Sag is thermally attenuated. The <b>stretching</b> <b>factor</b> (beta) of the lower crust increases from the north to the south of the continental margin, indicating two stretching centers: the Baiyun Sag and the Liwan Sag. The geometry of the shelf break and the beta isoline trap have the similar trend in 23. 8 and 13. 8 Ma, both located in the intense deforming zone of the lower crust, and therefore we conclude the stretching and flowing of the lower crust cause the displacement of the shelf break before and after 23. 8 Ma.

Two structural interpretations of seismic line GSP 97 - 19 have been considered: (1) a Mid-Late Jurassic rift basin based upon seismic interpretation f well-defined tilted fault blocks, with subsidence modelling of the thick overlying sediment section predicting high lithosphere <b>stretching</b> <b>factors</b> of up to fi = 6; (2) a Mid-Jurassic-Early Cretaceous rift responsible for a thick Barremian-Aptian synrift sequence within the basin centre resulting in reduced maximum lithospheric <b>stretching</b> <b>factors</b> of / 3 [...] = 2. 3. The variance in published estimates of crustal thickness beneath the basin cannot distinguish between these scenarios. A comparison between <b>stretching</b> <b>factors</b> and the amount of observable upper-crustal faulting suggests that depth-dependent lithospheric stretching may be a feature of the basin, as in other sedimentary basins along the Atlantic margin, and is directly associated with the onset of Cretaceous plate break-up in the Atlantic. The Porcupine Basin is a large north-south-trending sedimentary basin, located on the continental shelf c. 200 km west of Ireland (Fig. 1).

Abstract Lithospheric stretching is the key process in forming extensional sedimentary basins at passive rifted margins. This study explores the <b>stretching</b> <b>factors,</b> resulting extension, and structural evolution of the Møre segment on the Mid-Norwegian continental margin. Based on the interpretation of new and reprocessed high-quality seismic, we present updated structural maps of the Møre margin that show very thick post-rift sediments in the central Møre Basin and extensive sill intrusion into the Cretaceous sediments. A major shift in subsidence and deposition occurred during mid-Cretaceous.
