5|$|Two former {{restaurants}} operated at the campus: the Conservatory Restaurant was led {{by students}} of the Farm-to-Table concentration in the CIA's bachelor's degree programs. The Wine Spectator Greystone Restaurant (WSGR) was run by students in the associate degree program in culinary arts.

The WSGR initially served food of the Mediterranean cuisines, and was at first professionally run. Later on, it became fully student-run, however changes in late 2015 led to lunch service <b>staffed</b> <b>by</b> students and dinner service <b>staffed</b> <b>by</b> employees.

5|$|In the 4th century, the {{production}} of weapons and equipment was highly centralised (and presumably standardised) {{in a number of}} major state-run arms factories, or fabricae, documented in the Notitia. It is unknown when these were first established, but they certainly existed by the time of Diocletian. In the 2nd century, there is evidence of fabricae inside legionary bases and even in the much smaller auxiliary forts, <b>staffed</b> <b>by</b> the soldiers themselves. But there is no evidence, literary or archaeological, of fabricae outside military bases and <b>staffed</b> <b>by</b> civilians during the Principate (although their existence cannot be excluded, as no archaeological evidence has been found for the late fabricae either). Late fabricae were located in border provinces and dioceses. Some were general manufacturers producing both armour and weapons (fabrica scutaria et armorum) or just one of the two. Others were specialised in {{one or more of the}} following: fabrica spatharia (sword manufacture), lanciaria (spears), arcuaria (bows), sagittaria (arrows), loricaria (body armour), clibanaria (cataphract armour), and ballistaria (catapults).|$|E
