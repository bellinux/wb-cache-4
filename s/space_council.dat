25|$|Early in John F.

25|$|The {{legal basis}} for the EU/ESA {{co-operation}} is provided by a Framework Agreement which entered into force in May 2004.

25|$|Kennedy also {{appointed}} Johnson Chairman of the National Aeronautics <b>Space</b> <b>Council.</b> The Soviets {{beat the}} US {{with the first}} manned spaceflight in April 1961, and Kennedy gave Johnson the task of evaluating {{the state of the}} US space program and recommending a project that would allow the US to catch up or beat the Soviets. Johnson responded with a recommendation that the US gain the leadership role by committing the resources to embark on a project to land an American on the Moon in the 1960s. Kennedy assigned priority to the space program, but Johnson's appointment provided potential cover in case of a failure.|$|E
50|$|One of the Open <b>Space</b> <b>Council's</b> {{projects}} is the Conservation Lands Network, {{a vision for}} the region's efforts to preserve biodiversity. Part of a five-year science-based study by over 125 organizations and individuals, the project was tasked to identify the most essential lands needed to sustain the natural infrastructure of the region. The Conservation Land Network studied over 4.3 e6acre km2 and over 1,000 variables, such as redwood forests and California red legged frog habitats. Along with the Subtidal Habitat Goals Project and the Baylands Ecosystem Goals Project, this project is part of a science-based, regional approach to protecting biodiversity of the Bay Area.|$|R

IIT housed many research organizations: IIT Research Institute (formerly Armour Research Foundation and birthplace of magnetic recording wire and tape as well as audio and video cassettes), the Institute of Gas Technology, and the American Association of Railroads, among others.|$|E
25|$|T. Keith Glennan {{had been}} {{appointed}} the first Administrator of NASA, with Hugh L. Dryden (last Director of NACA) as his Deputy, at {{the creation of the}} agency on October 1, 1958. Glennan would report to the president through the National Aeronautics and <b>Space</b> <b>Council.</b> The group responsible for Project Mercury was NASA's Space Task Group, and the goals of the program were to orbit a manned spacecraft around Earth, investigate the pilot's ability to function in space, and to recover both pilot and spacecraft safely. Existing technology and off-the-shelf equipment would be used wherever practical, the simplest and most reliable approach to system design would be followed, and an existing launch vehicle would be employed, together with a progressive test program. Spacecraft requirements included: a launch escape system to separate the spacecraft and its occupant from the launch vehicle in case of impending failure; attitude control for orientation of the spacecraft in orbit; a retrorocket system to bring the spacecraft out of orbit; drag braking blunt body for atmospheric reentry; and landing on water. To communicate with the spacecraft during an orbital mission, an extensive communications network had to be built. In keeping with his desire to keep from giving the U.S. space program an overly military flavor, President Eisenhower at first hesitated to give the project top national priority (DX rating under the Defense Production Act), which meant that Mercury had to wait in line behind military projects for materials; however, this rating was granted in May 1959, {{a little more than a}} year and a half after Sputnik was launched.|$|E
500|$|Agnew {{was sworn}} in along with Nixon on January 20, 1969; as was customary, he sat down {{immediately}} after being sworn in, and {{did not make a}} speech. Soon after the inauguration, Nixon appointed Agnew as head of the Office of Intergovernmental Relations, to head government commissions such as the National <b>Space</b> <b>Council</b> and assigned him to work with state governors to bring down crime. It became clear that Agnew would not be in the inner circle of advisors. The new president preferred to deal directly with only a trusted handful, and was annoyed when Agnew tried to call him about matters Nixon deemed trivial. After Agnew shared his opinions on a foreign policy matter in a cabinet meeting, an angry Nixon sent Bob Haldeman to warn Agnew to keep his opinions to himself. Nixon complained that Agnew had no idea how the vice presidency worked, but did not meet with Agnew to share his own experience of the office. Herb Klein, director of communications in the Nixon White House, later wrote that Agnew had allowed himself to be pushed around by senior aides such as Haldeman and John Mitchell, and that Nixon's [...] "inconsistent" [...] treatment of Agnew had left the vice president exposed.|$|E

2500|$|The 1958 National Aeronautics and Space Act, {{which created}} NASA, created a National Aeronautics and <b>Space</b> <b>Council</b> chaired by the President to help advise him, which {{included}} the Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, NASA Administrator, Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, plus up to {{one member of the}} federal government, and up to three private individuals [...] "eminent in science, engineering, technology, education, administration, or public affairs" [...] appointed by the President. Before taking office as President, John F. Kennedy persuaded Congress to amend the Act to allow him to set the precedent of delegating chairmanship of this council to his Vice President (Lyndon B. Johnson). The Council was discontinued in 1973 during the presidency of Richard M. Nixon. In 1989, President George H. W. Bush re-established a differently constituted National <b>Space</b> <b>Council</b> by executive order, which was discontinued in 1993 by President Bill Clinton.|$|E

This flight {{was the first to}} reach the Moon and also the first to orbit the Moon. Anders took a celebrated photograph of an Earthrise.
