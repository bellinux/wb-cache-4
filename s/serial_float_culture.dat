40|$|In {{this study}} we {{dissected}} retinal organoid morphogenesis in human embryonic stem cell (hESC) -derived cultures and established a convenient method for isolating large quantities of retinal organoids for modeling human retinal development and disease. Epithelialized cysts were generated via <b>floating</b> <b>culture</b> of clumps of Matrigel/hESCs. Upon spontaneous attachment and spreading of the cysts, patterned retinal monolayers with tight junctions formed. Dispase-mediated detachment of the monolayers and subsequent <b>floating</b> <b>culture</b> led to self-formation of retinal organoids comprising patterned neuroretina, ciliary margin, and retinal pigment epithelium. Intercellular adhesion-dependent cell survival and ROCK-regulated actomyosin-driven forces are required for the self-organization.

For medical applications, therapeutic retinal cells, such as retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells or photoreceptor precursors, must be generated under completely defined conditions. To this purpose, we have developed a two-step xeno-free/feeder-free (XF/FF) culture system to efficiently differentiate hiPSCs into retinal cells. This simple method, relies only on adherent hiPSCs cultured in chemically defined media, bypassing embryoid body formation. In less than 1 month, adherent hiPSCs are able to generate self-forming neuroretinal-like structures containing retinal progenitor cells (RPCs). <b>Floating</b> <b>cultures</b> of isolated structures enabled the differentiation of RPCs into all types of retinal cells in a sequential overlapping order, with the generation of transplantation-compatible CD 73 + photoreceptor precursors in less than 100 days. Our XF/FF culture conditions allow the maintenance of both mature cones and rods in retinal organoids until 280 days with specific photoreceptor ultrastructures. Moreover, both hiPSC-derived retinal organoids and dissociated retinal cells can be easily cryopreserved while retaining their phenotypic characteristics and the preservation of CD 73 + photoreceptor precursors. Concomitantly to neural retina, this process allows the generation of RPE cells that can be effortlessly amplified, passaged, and frozen while retaining a proper RPE phenotype. These results demonstrate that simple and efficient retinal differentiation of adherent hiPSCs can be accomplished in XF/FF conditions.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There are no cures or efficacious {{treatments}} for severe motor neuron diseases. It {{is extremely difficult}} to obtain naïve spinal motor neurons (sMNs) from human tissues for research due to both technical and ethical reasons. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are alternative sources. Several methods for MN differentiation have been reported. However, efficient production of naïve sMNs and culture cost were not taken into consideration in most of the methods. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We aimed to establish protocols for efficient production and enrichment of sMNs derived from pluripotent stem cells. Nestin+ neural stem cell (NSC) clusters were induced by Noggin or a small molecule inhibitor of BMP signaling. After dissociation of NSC clusters, neurospheres were formed in a <b>floating</b> <b>culture</b> containing FGF 2. The number of NSCs in neurospheres could be expanded more than 30 -fold via several passages. More than 33 % of HB 9 + sMN progenitor cells were observed after differentiation of dissociated neurospheres by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and a Shh agonist for another week on monolayer culture. HB 9 + sMN progenitor cells were enriched by gradient centrifugation up to 80 % purity. These HB 9 + cells differentiated into electrophysiologically functional cells and formed synapses with myotubes during a few weeks after ATRA/SAG treatment.

In India, fish production and consumption is considered to be important and needs to be promoted. As capture fisheries have almost become stagnant, diversification of aquaculture is highly necessary. Considering the limited scope of freshwater aquaculture and the availability of vast coastline, open sea cage culture gained importance in the present day mariculture practice. Open sea <b>floating</b> cage <b>culture</b> is an alternative sustainable practice for rearing fish and shellfish species and polyculture along with seaweeds may also improve profitability and sustainability. Open sea cage culture is an aquaculture production system where high density of fish is cultured in floating cages. Floating cages are widely used in commercial aquaculture and individual cage units of desired shapes and sizes can be tailored to suit the needs...|$|R
40|$|Background Liver-to-pancreas {{conversion}} offers {{new possibilities}} for β-cell engineering for {{type 1 diabetes}} therapy. Among conceivable sources of liver cells, we focused on BMEL cells. These untransformed mouse embryonic liver cells have been reproducibly isolated from different inbred mice strains and {{have the potential to}} differentiate into hepatocytes and cholangiocytes in vitro and in vivo. Findings Strikingly, we find here that adherent BMEL cells display functional similarities with multipotent pancreatic precursor cells, namely Pdx 1 and Ngn 3 expression, and further express Hnf 6 in <b>floating</b> aggregate <b>culture.</b> Hes 1, a direct repressor of Ngn 3 and pancreatic endocrine commitment, is expressed in adherent BMEL cells and decreases with time in aggregate culture. However, Hes 1 decrease fails to initiate activation of late-stage pancreatic endocrine transcription factors. Conclusion Here we report that BMEL cells present features of pancreatic endocrine progenitor cells. In the field of diabetes research, BMEL cells are of potential interest for the study of inductive signals critical for in vitro β-cell maturation in-liver-to-pancreas conversion...|$|R
40|$|Contraction of type I {{collagen}} gels is an {{in vitro}} model of tissue remodeling. In addition to fibroblasts, some epithelial cells can mediate this process. We therefore hypothesized that alveolar epithelial cells might contract extracellular matrices {{and have the}} potential to directly participate in the remodeling of the lung after alveolar injury. A 549 cells were plated on top of collagen gels, and the gels were <b>floated</b> in <b>culture</b> medium. A 549 cells contracted the gels in a time- and cell density–dependent manner. A 549 cells, as well as human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) and rat alveolar epithelial cells (RalvEC) contracted collagen gels more when they were plated on top of the gel than when they were embedded inside, in contrast to human fetal lung fibroblast (HFL 1), which contracted more when cast inside. The amount of hydroxyproline in the collagen gels remained unchanged throughout the contraction. Anti–� 1 integrin antibody inhibited A 549 cell–mediated contraction...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} (1) {{find out the}} potential of the resources used by the community in Pulau Bauluang, (2) analyze the strategic development used by the community for sustainable use of resources. This research wasconducted in April-June 2013 in Pulau Bauluang, Selayar Regency. The population was fishermen, fish seller,housewives and those involved in mariculture. Total sample was 32 people. A survey and an FGD wasconducted for data acquirement. Data then analysed by descriptive correlation through qualitative approach. Results showed that (1) apart from housing, land use was dominated by coconut plantation and poultryhusbandry. Pulau Bauluang also has the potential for (religion-based) tourism. Marine resources used was forfish-catching and <b>floating</b> cage <b>culture.</b> The community was still focusing on using marine resources, hence thepotentials for the marine resources (especially corals) being degraded is still very high. (2) Strategicdevelopment based on SWOT analysis was in the position for diversification strategy (Quadrant II). In that case,it can be applied for communities 2 ̆ 7 activities in sustainable use of resources...|$|R
