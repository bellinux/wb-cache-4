500|$|... "La Couchette" [...] is {{the first}} episode of the second series of British dark comedy {{anthology}} Inside No. 9.

500|$|The <b>sleeper</b> <b>carriage</b> setting gave Shearsmith and Pemberton {{a number}} of [...] "traumatic" [...] {{elements}} to exploit, such as claustrophobia, proximity to strangers, motion, and the various elements associated with settling down to sleep, such as flatulence and getting undressed. These characteristics led to elements typical of Pemberton and Shearsmith's work—characteristics of what The Guardian critic Sam Wollaston calls [...] "Shearsmith'n'Pembertonism"—including [...] "macabre horror, stiff-handling, cadaver spooning" [...] and multiple twists. Commentators stressed how the characters are generally not particularly likable people, and one critic observed that the actors are somewhat typecast; [...] "Hesmondhalgh was frumpy but compassionate, while Whitehall played yet another clueless, posh student". The characters are mostly archetypes of British comedy—such as [...] "the rude German traveller" [...] and [...] "the British snob"—and the norms of these archetypes are used for both humour and to advance the plot. The archetypes are gradually unspun; for instance, the apparently well-meaning Les is revealed as somewhat xenophobic. The discovery of the body reveals the humanity of the various characters. For instance, Jorg is revealed to be more ill than vulgar, and Hugo is shown to be poor. Maxwell's character, by contrast, is not subverted.|$|E

500|$|The {{story was}} {{inspired}} by the intimacy of <b>sleeper</b> <b>carriages,</b> in which people aim to sleep in close proximity to strangers. [...] "La Couchette" [...] draws upon the literary tropes associated with stories, such as Murder on the Orient Express and Strangers on a Train, following characters unknown to one another while travelling. The various characters—played by actors somewhat typecast—correspond to British comedy archetypes, and much of the episode's story and humour derives from the characters' unlikability. Critics responded positively to [...] "La Couchette", commending the cast and script, but noted that Inside No. 9 is something of an acquired taste. On its first showing, the episode was watched by 1.1 million viewers (6.1% of the audience).|$|R
50|$|Podstakanniks {{appeared}} in Russian tea {{culture in the}} late 18th century, when drinking tea became common in Russia. Very soon they became not just practical utensils, but also works of art, just like samovars that were used for boiling water. Expensive podstakanniks {{for the rich and}} the elite were made of silver; however, they were not very practical, since they would get quite hot very quickly due to the high thermal conductivity of silver. By the 20th century, podstakanniks became very widespread. They were found extremely useful on railroads, as tea was served in moving carriages that were shaking. A bare glass was more likely to fall, scalding people with hot tea. The Russian railroads still use the podstakannik extensively in <b>sleeper</b> <b>carriages.</b>|$|R

50|$|Original {{products}} {{included the}} manufacture of stump-jump implements, strippers, windmills, pumps, horse-rakes, wheat separators, ploughs, harrows, scarifiers, and other agricultural and general implements. The firm later produced tramcars and railway rolling stock, assembled Ford Model Ts, and manufactured a range of stationary engines. It manufactured over 600 O class trams, which were not only used in Sydney, but also Brisbane, Melbourne, Ballarat and Bendigo. It manufactured {{many different types of}} rolling stock such as brake vans, coal wagons, Bradfield suburban carriages, 12 wheel carriages for the New South Wales Government Railways and <b>sleeper</b> <b>carriages</b> for the Trans-Australian Railway in 1915. There was a large fire in 1908 that totally destroyed the carriage shop and some completed railway carriages ready for delivery, as well as many uncompleted carriages and trams. This resulted in 150 men losing their jobs. Stationary engines were made in several sizes for general use, initially copies of the Scottish Melvin. The Commonwealth Government purchased both horizontal and vertical engines for use on the Trans-Australian Railway for pumping water into overhead tanks for the steam locomotives.|$|R

50|$|By the 1970s the {{carriages}} were dated {{and in need}} of replacement. They {{were not}} air conditioned, and during the ship voyage, while inside the ship, they became notably hot in summertime. This was exacerbated by the chaining of the vehicles to the ship's deck, an activity underneath the sleeping compartments which inevitably woke most passengers up {{during the middle of the}} night. The carriages were over 40 years old, and by some margin were the oldest passenger vehicles running on the British network. The CIWL livery was replaced on some, but not all, carriages by standard SNCF blue sleeper car livery including the SNCF logo and a prominent white stripe along the bodyside. Consideration was given to using British Rail Mark 1 <b>sleeper</b> <b>carriages</b> built in the late 1950s, but these too were dated and the idea was never adopted. The Night Ferry platform and trains as it was in 1974 are featured towards the end of the final Steptoe and Son episode, the 1974 Christmas special. The Night Ferry was also used in part during the 1976 Children's Film Foundation drama Night Ferry.|$|R

50|$|In 1907 the E type <b>carriage</b> <b>sleepers</b> were {{entering}} service and these sleepers were rendered obsolete, so the O fleet was split roughly equally {{between the two}} railways. In March 1908 the Mann Boudoir cars were reallocated; 1O and 4O went to the South Australian Railways; the pair were issued numbered 116 and 117 in the SAR fleet, while 2O and 3O became Sleeper No.6 and Mildura in the Victorian Railways' fleet. 29O and 30O were retained in Joint Stock service until further E type sleeping cars had been delivered, but they were allocated names Latrobe and Hindmarsh respectively.|$|R
50|$|When The Overland {{service was}} {{converted}} from E type carriages {{to a new}} steel, fully airconditioned train, eight new sleeping cars were built. The interiors of these new cars were of a more modern design than the older cars. The roomette cars had a zigzag corridor instead of a straight one, and the compartments had {{the shape of a}} trapezium. This enabled the use of the toilet and washbasin units while the bed was still down, not possible in the older roomettes.In 1949 the classleader, Allambi, entered service, followed by Tantini, Weroni, Dorai, Mururi and Chalaki in 1950 and Nomuldi and Mokai in 1951. Of those, Allambi, Tantini, Mururi and Chalaki were roomette cars with zigzag corridors; the other four were standard compartment-style twinette cars.The sleeping cars were of two types. Twinette cars had two-berth compartments (as had the E and Mann cars before them), but each compartment had an adjoining toilet and shower room; roomette cars had single-berth compartments either side of a central aisle, and a shower room {{at the end of the}} car. The new cars were not numbered, but instead given names based on Aboriginal words related to sleep or dreams.Additional carriages were built a few years later, with Roomettes Nankuri and Purpawi in 1955, Twinettes Tolkini (later Malkari) and Tandeni (later Paiti) in 1956, Twinettes Yanni and Kuldalai in 1957 and Roomettes Juki and Tarkinji in 1958.Two further cars were built in 1967, Twinettes Tawarri and Yankai, for a total fleet of eighteen. These last two had a slightly different interior layout.In 1971, the SAR's share in roomette cars Allambi and Tantini and twinette cars Dorai and Weroni was sold to the Victorian Railways for use on the Vinelander to Mildura. They were repainted dark blue and their names removed; these names were then applied to the same type of new cars built to replace them.The new sleepers, Weroni and Dorai (1971) and Allambi and Tantini (1972) were built with the altered interior matching the 1967 batch (though Allambi and Tantini were still roomettes).Under Victorian Railways, the cars had blue painted where maroon had previously been used, with Vinelander nameplates on the carriage sides in place of the names. The cars were numbered as Sleepers Nos 11 to 14, previously Allambi, Tantini, Weroni and Dorai. The New Deal in 1983 saw the four Victorian Railways <b>Sleeper</b> <b>carriages</b> renumbered to SJ 281 to 284, and the carriages were repainted again, this time with orange replacing the blue, with V/Line logos on plates fitted to the left ends.|$|R
