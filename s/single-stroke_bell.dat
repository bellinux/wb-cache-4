25|$|The NYSE's {{opening and}} closing bells mark the {{beginning}} and the end of each trading day. The 'opening bell' is rung at 9:30am ET to mark the start of the day's trading session. At 4pm ET the 'closing bell' is rung and trading for the day stops. There are bells located in each of the four main sections of the NYSE that all ring at the same time once a button is pressed. There are three buttons that control the bells, located on the control panel behind the podium which overlooks the trading floor. The main bell, which is rung at the beginning and end of the trading day, is controlled by a green button. The second button, colored orange, activates a <b>single-stroke</b> <b>bell</b> that is used to signal a moment of silence. A third, red button controls a backup bell which is used in case the main bell fails to ring.|$|E
50|$|Another type, the <b>single-stroke</b> <b>bell,</b> has no {{interrupting}} contacts. The hammer {{strikes the}} gong once {{each time the}} circuit is closed. These are used to signal brief notifications, such as a shop door opening for a customer, rather than continuous warnings.|$|E
50|$|Fire {{alarm bells}} {{are divided into}} two categories: {{vibrating}}, and single-stroke. On a vibrating bell, the bell will ring continuously until the power is cut off. When power is supplied to a <b>single-stroke</b> <b>bell,</b> the bell will ring once and then stop. It will not ring again until power is turned off and on again. These were frequently used with coded pull stations.|$|E
50|$|System tests {{could be}} {{conducted}} {{in one of two}} ways: In a coded pull station, there is either a test hole on the front (usually activated with an Allen wrench) or a test switch on the inside. Turning the switch one way causes the notification appliances to sound continuously (or in the case of <b>single-stroke</b> <b>bells,</b> ding once). Turning it the other way and then activating the pull allows a silent test to be done in which the station's mechanical parts are checked to ensure proper function. Once pulled, the station would do at least four rounds of code before resetting itself. Coded pulls were typically used in new fire alarm systems until roughly the 1950s, and then occasionally into the 1970s. Until the early 1990s, some panels were made with an extra zone to accommodate any existing coded pull stations. Nowadays, coded pull stations are very rare and almost never seen in working fire alarm systems.|$|R
50|$|A simple {{development}} of the <b>single-stroke</b> <b>bell</b> was the sprung bell. This had previously been used, mechanically actuated, for servant-call bells in large houses. Instead of working a clapper, the electromagnet shook the whole bell, which was mounted on a flexible spiral spring. The inertia of the heavy bell on the light spring would continue ringing for some seconds after the stroke. Although the sound would rapidly die away, the visible trembling of the bell could indicate which bell had been rung, amongst a panel of several.|$|E
50|$|The block {{instrument}} {{consists of a}} small cabinet; its front face displays two indicators — telegraph needles — and has a commutator handle (some early designs of {{block instrument}}s had miniature semaphore arms instead of needles). The upper indicator shows {{the state of the}} forward section, on the line leading away from the signal box. The commutator is used by the signalman to indicate the state of the section approaching his signal box, and the lower indicator repeats the commutator position. All indications are repeated on a similar instrument {{at the other end of}} the block section, in the associated signal box. The commutator has three positions and each of the two indicators has three positions: normal (or line blocked), line clear, and train on line. Either integral to the instrument or separately mounted, there is a <b>single-stroke</b> <b>bell</b> and a bell operating device, either a tapper or a plunger.|$|E
