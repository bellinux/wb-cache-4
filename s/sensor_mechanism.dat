Vesco claims that the foo fighters were in fact a form of ground-launched, {{automatically}} guided, jet-propelled flak mine called the Feuerball (Fireball). This device, supposedly operated by special SS units, [...] resembled a tortoise shell in shape, and it flew by means of gas jets that spun like a Catherine wheel around the fuselage. Miniature klystron tubes inside the device, {{in combination with the}} gas jets, created the characteristic glowing spheroid appearance of the foo fighters. A crude form of collision avoidance radar ensured the craft would not crash into another airborne object, and an onboard <b>sensor</b> <b>mechanism</b> would even instruct the machine to depart swiftly if it was fired upon. The purpose of the Feuerball, according to Vesco, was twofold. The appearance of this weird device inside a bomber stream would (and indeed did) have a distracting and disruptive effect on the bomber pilots. Also, Vesco alleges that the devices were also intended to have an [...] "offensive" [...] capability. Electrostatic discharges from the klystron tubes would, he stated, interfere with the ignition systems of the engines of the bombers, causing the planes to crash. Although there is no hard evidence to support the reality of the Feuerball drone, this theory has been taken up by other aviation/ufology authors, and it has even been cited by some as the most likely explanation for the phenomena -- in at least one recent TV [...] "documentary" [...] on Nazi Secret Weapons.|$|E

50|$|A urine sensor is a {{necessary}} part of any bedwetting alarm. A basic urine sensor consists of two electricity conductors separated by moisture absorbing insulating material. A low DC electric voltage, provided by batteries, is applied across these conductors. This low voltage is usually about 3 volts, {{so as not to be}} dangerous to the user. When this insulating material (frequently cotton cloth as in common briefs) absorbs urine, it allows electricity to pass through it and between the conductors, resulting in a small electric current in the conductors. The conductors are attached to an alarm device, which triggers an alarm when it senses this current. Most sensors and alarms are engineered based on this concept. Note that unless the urine reaches the <b>sensor</b> <b>mechanism</b> and adequately wets the briefs (or insulator between the conductors), the urine may not be sensed and the alarm will not activate. Sensors are usually classified in terms of their attachment mechanisms to the briefs or other urine absorbing medium. The major sensor attachment categories are mechanical clips, sticky tape or pads for flat surface sensors, magnetic attachment, and wiring sewed into special briefs.|$|E

40|$|Supercapacitors {{are likely}} to be adopted as power sources for {{wearable}} sensors; in particular where the <b>sensor</b> <b>mechanism</b> relies on energy harvesting. A specific advantage of supercapacitors over traditional batteries is their performance over large numbers of discharge cycles. Likewise, in the case of wearable devices, it is essential to efficiently manage the available power. Supercapacitors exhibit a small recovery effect, in part due to ion diffusion. Modelling this effect allows an increase in available energy to be realized following the sleep times during a discharge cycle thus increasing the time between charging for wearables. This paper presents the increase in useful lifetime that can be achieved via the recovery effect in a typical wearable device...|$|E

Before this mycorrhizal interaction {{can be established}} however, plant roots must be capable of detecting potential beneficial fungal partners and initiating the gene expression patterns necessary to begin symbiosis. To predict a plant root – mycorrhizal fungi sensor systems, we analyzed in vitro experiments of Populus tremuloides (aspen tree) and Laccaria bicolor (mycorrhizal fungi) interaction and leveraged over 200 previously published transcriptomic experimental data sets, 159 experimentally validated plant transcription factor binding motifs, and more than 120 -thousand experimentally validated protein-protein interactions to generate models of pre-mycorrhizal sensor systems in aspen root. These <b>sensor</b> <b>mechanisms</b> link extracellular signaling molecules with gene regulation through a network comprised of membrane receptors, signal cascade proteins, transcription factors, and transcription factor biding DNA motifs. Modeling predicted four pre-mycorrhizal sensor complexes in aspen that interact with fifteen transcription factors to regulate the expression of 1184 genes in response to extracellular signals synthesized by Laccaria. Predicted extracellular signaling molecules include common signaling molecules such as phenylpropanoids, salicylate, and, jasmonic acid. This multi-omic computational modeling approach for predicting the complex sensory networks yielded specific, testable biological hypotheses for mycorrhizal interaction signaling compounds, <b>sensor</b> complexes, and <b>mechanisms</b> of gene regulation...|$|R

When a query ex-pires, some sensors return to sleep and the CDS is restored. Our simulation results show that the solution is effective and it improved network lifetime...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCentral {{initiation}} of plus strand synthesis is a conserved feature of lentiviruses and certain other retroelements. This complication {{of the standard}} reverse transcription mechanism produces a transient “central DNA flap” in the viral cDNA, which has been proposed to mediate its subsequent nuclear import. This model has assumed that the important feature is the flapped DNA structure itself rather than the process that produces it. Recently, an alternative kinetic model was proposed. It posits that central plus strand synthesis functions to accelerate conversion to the double-stranded state, thereby helping HIV- 1 to evade single-strand DNA-targeting antiviral restrictions such as APOBEC 3 proteins, and perhaps to avoid innate immune <b>sensor</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The model is consistent with evidence that lentiviruses must often synthesize their cDNAs when dNTP concentrations are limiting and with data linking reverse transcription and uncoating. There may be additional kinetic advantages for the artificial genomes of lentiviral gene therapy vectors...|$|R

40|$|Before they infect {{red blood}} cells and cause malaria, Plasmodium parasites undergo an obligate and {{clinically}} silent expansion phase in the liver that is supposedly undetected by the host. Here, we demonstrate the engagement of a type I interferon (IFN) response during Plasmodium replication in the liver. We identified Plasmodium RNA as a previously unrecognized pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) capable of activating a type I IFN response via the cytosolic pattern recognition receptor Mda 5. This response, initiated by liver-resident cells through the adaptor molecule for cytosolic RNA sensors, Mavs, and the transcription factors Irf 3 and Irf 7, is propagated by hepatocytes in an interferon-alpha/beta receptor-dependent manner. This signaling pathway is critical for immune cell-mediated host resistance to liver-stage Plasmodium infection, which we find can be primed with other PAMPs, including hepatitis C virus RNA.

All over the world cars are preferred for transportation, and accordingly the number of cars increases, unfortunately, together with pollutants. Boilers and powerplants are other sources of pollutants to the environment. Metal-Insulator-Silicon Carbide (MISiC) Field-effect sensors in car applications and boilers have the potential to reduce the amount of pollutants. These devices are sensitive to several gases in exhaust and flues gases, such as hydrogen, hydrocarbons, and ammonia (for the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) application).

The <b>sensor</b> <b>mechanism</b> is based on the tunable internal charge transfer (ICT) transition of molecule 1. Binding of Cd 2 + ion quenches the ICT transition, but turns on the π − π transition of the fluorophore, thus enabling ratiometric fluorescence sensing.

By establishing a stable contact between the oocyte vitelline membrane and an ion-sensitive field-effect (ISFET) sensor inside a microperfusion channel, changes in surface pH that are hypothesized to result from facilitated proton lateral diffusion along the membrane were detected. The solute diffusion barrier created between the sensor and the active membrane area allowed detection of surface proton concentration free from interference of solutes in bulk solution. The proposed <b>sensor</b> <b>mechanism</b> was verified by heterologously expressing membrane transport proteins and recording changes in surface pH during application of the specific substrates. Experiments conducted on two families of phosphate-sodium cotransporters (SLC 20 & SLC 34) demonstrated {{that it is possible}} to detect phosphate transport for both electrogenic and electroneutral isoforms and distinguish between transport of different phosphate species.

Some of the reviewed work include an automatic braking system that safely stops an automobile while approaching an obstruction to avoid collision. Another separate but related system is to have a detection device, which alerts the driver in case the automobile veers off the road by crossing either the centre or side painted lines.

40|$|The DNA {{replication}} machinery plays additional {{roles in}} S phase checkpoint control, although {{the identities of}} the replication proteins involved in checkpoint activation remain elusive. Here, we report that depletion of the prereplicative complex (pre-RC) protein Cdc 6 causes human nontransformed diploid cells to arrest nonlethally in G 1 -G 1 /S and S phase, whereas multiple cancer cell lines undergo G 1 -G 1 /S arrest and cell death. These divergent phenotypes are dependent on the activation, or lack thereof, of an ataxia telangiectasia and Rad 3 -related (ATR) -dependent S phase checkpoint that inhibits replication fork progression. Although pre-RC deficiency induces chromatin structural alterations in both nontransformed and cancer cells that normally lead to ATR checkpoint activation, the <b>sensor</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in cancer cells seem to be compromised such that higher levels of DNA replication stress/damage are required to trigger checkpoint response.
