The {{intertidal zone}} {{is also home to}} many several species from different taxa including Porifera, Annelids, Coelenterates, Mollusks, crustaceans, Arthropods, etc. Water is available regularly with the tides but varies from fresh with rain to highly saline and dry salt with drying between tidal inundations. Wave <b>splash</b> <b>can</b> dislodge residents from the littoral zone. With the intertidal zone's high exposure to the sun, the temperature range can be anything from very hot with full sun to near freezing in colder climates. Some microclimates in the littoral zone are ameliorated by local features and larger plants such as mangroves. Adaptation in the littoral zone allows the use of nutrients supplied in high volume on a regular basis from the sea, which is actively moved to the zone by tides. Edges of habitats, in this case land and sea, are themselves often significant ecologies, and the littoral zone is a prime example.|$|E

In a typical course, the boatful of riders floats through a small section of channel upon leaving the station, then engages a lift hill that takes them on a winding course in the water-filled trough. A second lifthill then culminates with an exciting drop and a splashdown finale.

Additionally, the exit path from the ride may cross over or go near to the flume, such that departing riders are drenched by the boat currently en route.|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of water drop impact at high impinging velocity onto superhydrophobic substrates is experimentally investigated. The solid substrate—comprised of regular and hydrophobic micropillars—is transparent, thereby facilitating close-up, top-or-bottom-view, high-speed imaging. With a sufficient impact velocity, {{instead of a}} completely-bouncing ‘‘Fakir’’ droplet, wetting <b>splashing</b> <b>can</b> occur, with an entrapped air bubble at the centre surrounded by a wetted area {{as well as an}} emission of satellite droplets during the advancing phase of spreading lamella. A large portion of the lamella travels upon air and subsequently recoils due to surface tension, forming a partial rebound on the central wet spot. We present and discuss quantitative results of the entrapped air bubble, the central wetted area, and the maximal spreading lamella as the impact velocity is increased. We further vary the lattice periodicity of the micro-patterns and find its profound influence on the macroscopic flow. More specifically, directional <b>splashing</b> <b>can</b> emerge, emitting secondary droplets in certain directions which are associated with the lattice. Directional <b>splashing</b> <b>can</b> be suppressed to a gentle spreading by decreasing the periodicity of the lattice and, furthermore, can be tuned to a completely-wetting splashing in the diagonal directions of the lattice by a larger periodicity, offering opportunities to control the wetting process. Finally, the elimination of directional splashing by reducing air pressure suggests that the underlying air is squeezed outwards by the falling droplet upon the solid boundary whereby the air flow is affected, leading to different splashing behavior...|$|R

40|$|Cu {{wire bonding}} {{research}} has exploded exponentially {{in the past}} few years. Many studies have been carried out to understand the different behaviours of Cu wire and Au wire. One of the observations on Cu wire bonding is the excessive formation of aluminium (Al) splash on the bond pad due to a higher bond force. This leads to pad peeling and bond failure resulting in poor reliability performance of Cu and PdCu wire semiconductor devices. It is known that the Al splash is influenced by the front-end pad metal process and back-end wire bond process. Reported is the design of an experiment carried out to study a few factors that could influence the Al splash. The characterisation work is implemented to understand the bond pad structure using the focused ion beam (FIB) followed by a hardness test of bond pad metallisation. Then the mechanical cross-section is taken to measure the Al splash in three different directions. The results show that Al <b>splash</b> <b>can</b> be controlled by optimising the bond pad thickness, hardness and additive for reliable Cu and PdCu wire bonding...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-The key {{components}} of watershed processes are inputs in precipitation, interactions of vegetation, soil and water including evapotranspiration (water yield), overland flow (erosion), and storage and filtering (nutrients), and outputs in streamflow. Fire effects occur at the vegetation-soil interface and can result in altering overland flow and infiltration rate of water. Fire can affect infiltration rates by collapsing soil structure and reducing soil porosity, contributing ash and charcoal residues which can clog soil pores, and raindrop <b>splash</b> <b>can</b> compact soil and firther contribute to loss of soil porosity. An extreme example {{is the development of}} hydrophobic soils as observed in the western U. S. following severe wildfire. Watershed responses to fire depend on intensity and severity. Many factors influence fire severity including {{the quality and quantity of}} fuels, soil properties, topography, climate, and weather. The most important factors influencing the response to fire are vegetation mortality and the loss of the forest floor which are directly proportional to fire severity. Vegetation mortality reduces nutrient and water uptake, soil stability with root death, and the litter source for forest floor replenishment. The forest floor litter and humus (duQ layers provide soil cover, act as a sponge, and enhance infiltration.

The challenge is that high-level health decisions require understanding complex interactions of diverse systems across many disciplines {{both inside and outside}} of healthcare, creating a need for experts across widely different domains to combine their data and models. Splash—the Smarter Planet Platform for Analysis and Simulation of Health—is a novel decision support framework that facilitates combining heterogeneous, pre-existing simulation models and data from different domains and disciplines. Splash leverages and extends data integration, search, and scientific-workflow technologies to permit loose coupling of models via data exchange. This approach avoids the need to enforce universal standards for data and models, thereby facilitating both model interoperability and reuse of models and data that were independently created or curated by different individuals or organizations. In this way <b>Splash</b> <b>can</b> help domain experts from different areas collaborate effectively and efficiently to attack complex health problems.

40|$|Motivation: The {{discovery}} of sparse amino acid patterns that match repeatedly {{in a set}} of protein sequences is an important problem in computational biology. Statistically significant patterns, that is, patterns that occur more frequently than expected, may identify regions that have been preserved by evolution and which may therefore play a key functional or structural role. Sparseness can be important because a handful of non-contiguous residues may play a key role, while others, in between, may be changed without significant loss of function or structure. Similar arguments may be applied to conserved DNA patterns. Available sparse pattern discovery algorithms are either inefficient or impose limitations on the type of patterns that can be discovered. Results: This paper introduces a deterministic pattern discovery algorithm, called Splash, which can find sparse amino or nucleic acid patterns matching identically or similarly {{in a set of}} protein or DNA sequences. Sparse patterns of any length, up {{to the size of the}} input sequence, can be discovered without significant loss in performances. Splash is extremely efficient and embarrassingly parallel by nature. Large databases, such as a complete genome or the non-redundant SWISS-PROT database can be processed in a few hours on a typical workstation. Alternatively, a protein family or superfamily, with low overall homology, can be analyzed to discover common functional or structural signatures. Some examples of biologically interesting motifs discovered by Splash are reported for the histone I and for the G-Protein Coupled Receptor families. Due to its efficiency, <b>Splash</b> <b>can</b> be used to systematically and exhaustively identify conserved regions in protein family sets.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse {{the impact of}} a {{circular}} disc on a free surface using experiments, potential flow numerical simulations and theory. We focus our attention both on the study of the generation and possible breakup of the splash wave created after the impact and on the calculation of the force on the disc. We have experimentally found that drops are only ejected from the rim located at the top part of the splash – giving rise to {{what is known as the}} crown splash – if the impact Weber number exceeds a threshold value Wecrit? 140. We explain this threshold by defining a local Bond number Botip based on the rim deceleration and its radius of curvature, with which we show using both numerical simulations and experiments that a crown splash only occurs when Botip? 1, revealing that the rim disrupts due to a Rayleigh–Taylor instability. Neglecting the effect of air, we show that the flow in the region close to the disc edge possesses a Weber-number-dependent self-similar structure for every Weber number. From this we demonstrate that Botip?We, explaining both why the transition to crown <b>splash</b> <b>can</b> be characterized in terms of the impact Weber number and why this transition occurs for Wecrit? 140. Next, including the effect of air, we have developed a theory which predicts the time-varying thickness of the very thin air cushion that is entrapped between the impacting solid and the liquid. Our analysis reveals that gas critically affects the velocity of propagation of the splash wave as well as the time-varying force on the disc, FD. The existence of the air layer also limits the range of times in which the self-similar solution is valid and, accordingly, the maximum deceleration experienced by the liquid rim, that sets the length scale of the splash drops ejected when We>Wecrit...|$|E

40|$|Since Ellison (1947) {{described}} {{the process of}} erosion as comprising a) the detachment of soil particles from the soil mass by raindrop impact, b) detachment by runoff, c) the transport of the detached particles by raindrop impact, and d) transport by runoff, research has been directed into the mechanics {{of each of these}} four phases and how the phases might be linked together {{in the form of a}} soil erosion model, such as the Meyer-Wischmeier (1969) model. From a literature review, it became evident that in spite of this work, gaps in knowledge still exist and that i) most studies on soil erosion tend to lump the processes together; ii) whilst a considerable amount of investigation has been carried out on splash erosion, the other processes have received very little attention; iii) there is no explicit study on the effects of factor-interactions on the processes and the role of the laboratory as a place for studying interactions by controlling factors has not attracted much attention; iv) equipment and techniques for the separate evaluation of the detachment and transport of soil particles by overland flow are not available; and v) studies on the hydraulic characteristics of overland flow in relation to the detachment and transport of soil particles in such flows are scarce. This study was therefore specifically aimed at establishing a sounder research base for modelling the subprocesses and ultimate~ for soil conservation design b,y: i) evaluating separate~ each of the above subprocesses; ii) assessing the influence of the factors affecting the processes, particular~ their interactioDS; and iii) examining the hydraulics of soil particle detachment and transport by overland flow with and without rain. As a means to achieve these objectives, a factorial experiment vas set up in the laboratory to examine both the individual effects of rainfall intensity (50, 80, 110, 140 mm h- 1), soil ~ (standard sand, ISIUld, clay loam and clay) and slope steep: 1. 8 Ss (3. 5, 7. 0, 10. 5 and 14. 0 per cent) and their interactions on each of the above subprocesses. Additionally, the effects of four rates of runoff (1. 0, 1. 6, 2. 2 and 2. 8 ~min) on the hydraulic characteristics of flow such as velocity, depth, Reyuolds number, Froude number and friction factor were examined and used in characterizing the detachment and transport of soil particles in these flows. For each subprocess, these variables were replicated four times. Splash detachment and transport were determined by simulating rainfall from a nozzle simulator over a target soil placed in a rectangular soil tray (10 x 20 x 4 cm) which being set in the centre of a catching tray (90 x 80 x 30 cm) allows for the separate determination of ups lope and downslope splash. The separate measurement of the detachment and transport of soil particles by overland flow with and without rain was carried out b,y using a specially designed rainfall simulator - bed flume facility with runoff and sediment input and measuring devices. The results were analysed by analysis of variance to show the Significance of soil type, rainfall in tensi ty, flow rate t slope steepness and their first and second order interactions in influencing the processes studied. Multiple correlation techniques were used to search for the best associations between the erosion influencing variables and soil loss. RegreSSion analySis was used for establishing predictive equations for detachment and transport rates. Detachment of the test soils by <b>splash</b> <b>can</b> be placed in rank order of standard sand, sand, clay and clay loam with increasing resistance. For splash transport the order is standard sand) clay > sand > clay loam. For each soil type there are significant increases in splash detachment and transport with increasing rain intensity and slope steepness. The most significant interactions influencing the two splash processes are soil x intensity and slope x intensity for detachment and transport respectivel,J. Significant interactions show that the factors are not independent of each other; the simple effects of a factor differ, and the magnitude of any simple effect varies according to the level of the other factors of the interaction term. The factors influencing detachment by flow without rain rank in ~ order of importance as soil type, slope steepness and discharge. The corresponding order for flow with rain is discharge, slope steepness and soil type. The order of soil detachability for both flow with and without rain is standard sand, sand ~ clay loam> clay. There are also significant increases in detachment rate as slope steepness and flow rate increase. It is further shown that the first and second order interactions of the above factors Significantly influence detachment by flow. On a relative basis, the second order interaction is small and the importance of the first order interactions can be placed in an increasing order of slope x soil, slope x discharge t and discharge x soil for flow without rain. For flow with rain, they rank as slope x soil, discharge x soil, and slope x discharge. The slope x soil interaction showed that as slope steepens the influence of each Boil on detachment rates increases with the proportionate increase being greater for sand and standard sand than for clay and clay loam. The slope x discharge interaction revealed significant increases in detachment rate for all slopes as discharge increased. The magnitude of the response is however greater at the lower than higher slopes. As slope steepness increases, detachment rates by flow with and without rain are also enhanced. The increase was proportionately more for the 1. 0 and 1. 6 J/min than 2. 2 and 2. 8 J/min flows. The Boil x discharge interactiC?n also indicated that, for flow without rain, detachability increases more for clay and clay loam than for the sand and standal'd sand as discharge increases. In the presence of rain however, the response of the soils did not differ much. Detachment by flow without rain is predominantly by rilling. In the presence of rain, detacbment rates by flow are increased about three fold and relatively even removal of soil particles from the eroding bed is characteristic. Raindrop impact thus appears to inhibit rill formation by overland flow especially on small slope steepnesses. There is a critical slope steepness at which both raindrop impact and overland flow contribute equally to total detachment. At slopes lower than the critical value, raindrop impact is the main detaching agent whilst flow predominates the detachment process at steeper slopes. The critical slope steepness is soil specific and decreases in the order of clay ~ clay loam) sand ~ standard sand. The transport of soil particles by combined flow and rain is significantly influenced by soil type, slope steepness, flow rate and their first and second order interactions. Transport rates decreased in the order of sand > standard sand) clay) clay loam. Increases in discharge and slope steepness significantly increased transport capacity. For a discharge range of 1. 0 - 2. 8 l/min, transport capacity increased four fold. The most significant interaction that influences transport capacity is slope x soil. Where factors interact significantly, interpretation of results based solely on the main effects of the influencing factors m& 1 result in loss of vital information and lead to wrong conclusions. For example, examination of the slope x soil interaction showed that at lower slopes (3. 5 and 7. 0 per cent) combined flow and rain has a greater transport capacity for the larger clay and clay loam aggregates than for the fine grains of sand and standard sand. This is obscured when effects are averaged over all the slopes as is the case when only main effects are considered...|$|E
