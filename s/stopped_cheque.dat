[...] Those instructions were confirmed in writing, and entered by Barclays Bank in its computer system. [...] However, due to an error the payment was made. [...] Once the bank discovered the error, they contacted the receiver and demanded repayment of the sum, but the receiver (Mr Sowman) refused. [...] The bank accepted that it was not entitled to debit the account of the Association, and brought proceedings against the Company for the return of the monies which it had mistakenly paid out under the <b>stopped</b> <b>cheque.</b>|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{has three}} objectives: first, {{to examine the}} law {{relating}} to loss allocation resulting from fraud with consumer payment instruments and determine whether this allocation is efficient; second, to determine whether any right to stop or reverse payment associated with the payment instrument is efficient; and third, to suggest changes and reforms to achieve efficiency in these two areas. The basic test to determine efficiency of allocation of fraud loss {{to be used in}} the thesis involves looking at the following questions: which party in the transaction or system can, because of size, wealth, insurance, or the ability to pass on costs, best bear the risk of non–payment? Which party can most easily avoid the loss? And which rule is the least costly rule to enforce? In regard to electric funds transfer it was found that the test in the current Electronic Funds Transfer Code (EFT Code), although purporting to be worked out on efficiency principles is, in fact, unduly complicated and the thesis recommends the adoption of simple failure to report loss theft or fraud by the consumer as a test for allocation of fraud loss. Signature credit cards are currently not covered by the EFT Code and fraud loss allocation is determined by contract law but, nevertheless, a similar test is advocated in regard to them too. In regard to cheques it was found the forgery rule as regards the drawer’s signature and the ancillary Ligget rule are basically efficient but the rule regarding indorser’s signature is inefficient - making cheques not transferable would help eliminate this inefficiency. As to fraudulent alterations, it was advocated that paying banks should bear total loss for fraudulent and material alterations with a right, of course, against the person who has made the alteration. In regard to financial institution cheques, the thesis recommends that the definition of a financial institution cheque (which covers bank cheques) should be extended to cover cheques drawn by one financial institution on another one. It recommends that where consideration has been provided at any stage for a bank cheque then it should be able to be enforced. It was also advocated that the gist of the Australian Paper Clearing System assurances needs to be enshrined in legislation (an example of the sort of legislative change that would hopefully ensure certainty of payment has also been suggested). To ameliorate the position from an efficiency perspective, the following is also advocated: a duty of care in regard to the safekeeping of bank cheques should be introduced; responsibility for alterations should also be placed on the issuing banks as a spur to devise alteration proof bank cheques; and when consumers buy bank cheques they should be asked for what purpose it is being purchased and this should be written by the banks on the front of the bank cheque. Whether a uniform rule for fraud loss allocation across different payment systems is a possibility is also explored. It was found that a uniform rule for fraud loss allocation would seem to be more efficient than making efficiency ameliorations to existing fraud allocation tests in the various payment systems. Allied with the problem of fraud loss allocation is the issue of whether consumers should have a right of stopping or reversing payment if consumers perceive they are the potential victims of fraud or sharp dealing. Again the thesis examined whether this is efficient. In regard to cheques it was found that the right to stop payment is efficient but that such a right could be ameliorated by allowing the drawer a right to set up any dispute against the vendor in the same action where the vendor/payee brings an action on the <b>stopped</b> <b>cheque.</b> Moreover, the right to stop cheques should be explicitly extended to stolen cheques. In addition banks should have to reaccredit the account in accordance with the stop payment order and banks should have the burden of proving that no loss stemmed from their error. On the other hand, in regard to financial institution cheques (including bank cheques) if they are to be effective cash substitutes, efficiency demands that purchasers not be allowed to use their disputes with the vendor, even if they may seem to involve fraud, to stop the banks paying out on the bank cheques, unless there is a court order. As to signature credit cards it is advocated the gist of American law on chargebacks absent any territorial restrictions should be put into Australian federal legislation. Allegations of contractual non compliance should require the buyer to send the goods back to the seller or, at least be able to show a bona fide attempt to do so, as a precondition to the exercise of chargeback rights and as part of a requirement that the buyer should make an attempt to first settle the matter with the seller. Proposed federal legislation covering chargebacks should also extend to other forms of electronic payment like BPAY as well as PIN credit cards. Chargeback rights should also apply where debit systems mimic cash but with a $ 150 threshold before they apply and subject to the goods being returned to the seller. Finally, the thesis explores whether a uniform right to stop payment would be more efficient than the inconsistency and inefficiency of current Australian stop payment rules and concludes that such right should be along the lines of the never enacted American Uniform New Payments Code since is clear, concise and efficient compared with other attempts to formulate uniform rules. ...|$|E

50|$|Applying {{the facts}} to the case, {{the court held that}} (1) the mistake of the bank in {{overlooking}} the instruction to <b>stop</b> the <b>cheque</b> caused the payment; that (2) as the bank was acting without mandate, no obligation of the Association to the payee was discharge, and it follows from this that the payee gave no consideration to the bank for payment; (3) {{there was no evidence of}} any change of position by the recipient. Accordingly, the court ordered that the sums be repaid to the bank.|$|R

5000|$|A {{dishonoured cheque}} cannot be {{redeemed}} for its value and is worthless; {{they are also}} known as an RDI (returned deposit item), or NSF (non-sufficient funds) cheque. Cheques are usually dishonoured because the drawer's account has been frozen or limited, or because there are insufficient funds in the drawer's account when the cheque was redeemed. A cheque drawn on an account with insufficient funds {{is said to have}} bounced and may be called a rubber cheque. [...] Banks will typically charge customers for issuing a dishonoured cheque, and in some jurisdictions such an act is a criminal action. A drawer may also issue a <b>stop</b> on a <b>cheque,</b> instructing the financial institution not to honour a particular cheque.|$|R
5000|$|In the United Kingdom, Ireland, and France, cheques {{are still}} popular, partly because cheques remain {{free of charge}} to {{personal}} customers; however, bank-to-bank transfers are increasing in popularity. Since 2001, businesses in the United Kingdom have made more electronic payments than cheque payments. Automated payments rose from 753 million in 1995 to 1.1 billion in 2001 and cheques declined in that same period of time from 1.14 to 1.1 billion payments. Most utilities in the United Kingdom charge lower prices to customers who pay by direct debit than for other payment methods, including electronic methods. The vast majority of retailers in the United Kingdom and many in France have not accepted cheques {{as a means of}} payment for several years, and cheque guarantee cards are no longer issued. For example, Shell announced in September 2005 that it would no longer accept cheques at its UK petrol stations. This was soon followed by other major fuel retailers, such as Texaco, BP, and Total. Asda announced in April 2006 that it would <b>stop</b> accepting <b>cheques,</b> initially as a trial in the London area, and Boots announced in September 2006 that it would <b>stop</b> accepting <b>cheques,</b> initially as a trial in Sussex and Surrey. Currys (and other stores in the DSGi group) and WH Smith also no longer accept cheques. Cheques are now widely predicted to become a thing of the past, or at most, a niche product used to pay private individuals or for the very large number of small service providers who are not willing to provide their bank details to customers to allow electronic payments to be made to them or do not wish to be burdened with checking their bank accounts frequently and reconciling them with amounts due (for example, music teachers, driving instructors, children's sports lessons, small shops, schools). The UK Payments Council announced in December 2009 that cheques would be phased out by October 2018, but only if adequate alternatives were developed. They intended to perform annual checks on the progress of other payments systems and a final review of the decision would have been held in 2016. Concerns were expressed, however, by charities and older people, who are still heavy users of cheques, and replacement plans were criticized as open to fraud. [...] It was therefore announced by the UK Payments Council in July 2011 that the cheque would not be eliminated. 432 million inter-bank cheques and credit-items worth £472 billion were processed in the United Kingdom in 2016 according to Payments UK.|$|R

His father was often away from home but sent regular pay cheques to 9Newcastle Road, Liverpool, where Lennon lived with his mother; the <b>cheques</b> <b>stopped</b> when he went absent without leave in February 1944. When he eventually came home six months later, he offered to look after the family, but Julia—by then pregnant with another man's child—rejected the idea. After her sister Mimi complained to Liverpool's Social Services twice, Julia gave her custody of Lennon. In July 1946, Lennon's father visited her and took his son to Blackpool, secretly intending to emigrate to New Zealand with him. Julia followed them—with her partner at the time, 'Bobby' Dykins—and after a heated argument his father forced the five-year-old to choose between them. Lennon twice chose his father, but as his mother walked away, he began to cry and followed her, although this has been disputed. According to author Mark Lewisohn, Lennon's parents agreed that Julia should take him and give him a home as Alf left again. A witness who was there that day, Billy Hall, has said the dramatic scene often portrayed with a young John Lennon having to make a decision between his parents never happened. It would be 20 years before he had contact with his father again.|$|R
