The camera follows Squires' gun to his desk drawer and we're kept aware of its presence thanks to Nina and Squires' [...] "If I’d <b>shot</b> <b>you,</b> here in the dark/With an empty gun?

Nina is shown drinking from the poisoned cup one of two times she admiringly calls Squires [...] "devious" [...] (a hint at her true feelings about him) and once again when she emphasises the word [...] "plan". While Squires is telling the story of the Sphinx and she seems to be gazing at the statue of it, she's actually looking at the photograph of her brother on display directly below.|$|E
500|$|At the 56th Annual Grammy Awards in January 2014, Metallica {{performed}} [...] "One" [...] with Chinese pianist Lang Lang. In March 2014, Metallica began a tour called [...] "Metallica By Request", {{in which}} fans request songs {{for the band}} to perform. A new song, titled [...] "Lords of Summer" [...] was written for the concerts and released as a [...] "first take" [...] demo in June 2014. In June 2014, the band headlined the Glastonbury Festival {{in an attempt to}} attract new fans. Ulrich said, [...] "We have one <b>shot,</b> <b>you</b> never know if you'll be invited back". In November 2014, Metallica performed at the closing ceremony of BlizzCon 2014. In January 2015, Metallica announced a [...] "Metallica Night" [...] with the San Jose Sharks, which featured a Q session with the band and a charity auction benefiting the San Francisco Bay Chapter of the Sierra Club, but no performances. They were announced to headline Lollapalooza in March 2015, returning to perform there {{for the first time in}} 20 years. On May 2, 2015, Metallica performed their third annual Metallica Day at AT Park. Metallica were also announced to play at X Games for the first time at X Games Austin 2015 in Austin, Texas. On June 14, 2015, Hetfield and Hammett performed The Star-Spangled Banner live via electric guitars prior to game 5 of the NBA Finals between the Cleveland Cavaliers and Golden State Warriors at Oracle Arena in Oakland, California.

2500|$|The {{project of}} co-writing was {{expedited}} by the {{collaboration between the}} four co-writers on the internet working from different geographical locations. With Iñárritu in Los Angeles, Giacobone and Bo in Buenos Aires, and Dinelaris in New York, the script was mainly written through Skype calls and emails. Although this complicated the writing process, Dinelaris said he believed the best ideas in Birdman came from Skype sessions {{at two in the}} morning where he and Giacobone were [...] "cracking each other up". Incorporating the one-shot feature also affected the writing. Bo said [...] "We wrote everything thinking of this one shot, and a lot of decisions that would mostly be taken in the editing room were taken before shooting". The one-shot approach meant the scenes could not be removed or re-ordered in post-production, so the writers needed to be [...] "very, very sure about what was on the page." [...] As a result, it took about a year and a half to complete the final draft. As Dinelaris summarized: [...] "You have to be an idiot to do it all in one <b>shot.</b> <b>You</b> have to be an idiot to attempt it. It takes a great, great deal of ignorance to not pay attention to the difficulties and to think you're going to do this. Birdman looks like a good idea now, but [...] we did not know how we would land." ...|$|E
50|$|For forward <b>shots,</b> <b>you</b> can {{use your}} index finger, middle finger, or even the 'scissors' shot. Before shooting, try {{touching}} the striker with your fingernail, {{to be sure that}} its really on line. This will improve your accuracy and prevent you from hurting your finger.|$|R
5000|$|The line [...] "no security" [...] {{appears in}} the song, [...] "One Hit (To the Body)" [...] on the Dirty Work (1986) album. [...] "It's one <b>shot</b> when <b>you</b> love me, one <b>shot</b> when <b>you</b> leave me, I don't need no security, I just need me some peace." ...|$|R
50|$|Jacobs noted some {{interesting}} challenges during {{the shooting of}} video with seagulls flying {{in and out of}} the building for shelter due to the heavy rain on the day of the shoot. Sharon Corr once said that in some <b>shots,</b> <b>you</b> can, in fact, see the birds landing in the galleries.|$|R
2500|$|Academy Award nominee, screenwriter and {{director}} Josh Olson, most {{famous for his}} screenplay for A History of Violence, made a video review of Sorcerer for the Trailers from Hell webseries in 2007. He praised the movie highly, stating that it is Friedkin's best effort ("Sorcerer is Friedkin {{at the top of}} his game") and was [...] "at least equal to the original." [...] He also applauded the atmosphere, which he said had [...] "a wonderful tone to it and a real sense of dread and desperation [...] it's tight and suspenseful, every scene grabs you by the collar, and it's beautifully <b>shot.</b> <b>You</b> can feel the humidity down there in South America. You can feel the sweat on the sticks of dynamite." [...] He concluded the review by saying that the only aspect in which the movie failed was the fact that it came out around the same time as Star Wars. Olson felt that [...] "the movie deserved a huge audience" [...] as well as fantasizing that [...] "somewhere there's an alternate universe where Sorcerer is a massive game-changing hit in Hollywood and I'm doing Trailers from Hell commentary on some unknown cult classic called Star Wars. In that world Hollywood has spent the next 30 years making smart, edgy movies for grown-ups, the literacy rate is 100%, we haven't been in a war since Vietnam and world hunger is just a memory." ...|$|E

50|$|Wind Scroll: Indicated by a tornado, this scroll is {{technically}} the weakest of the Chi powers, {{in terms of}} damage, but it makes up for that {{in its ability to}} fling the enemies around and blow them off balance. It's also one of only two scrolls that allows you to control the Chi <b>Shots</b> <b>you</b> fire, though guiding the mini-tornadoes produced by the <b>Shot</b> leaves <b>you</b> open to attack. The Chi Blast, however, leaves no such opening, as it creates a venerable hurricane of twisters to force the opponent's to reenact the house sequence in The Wizard of Oz.|$|R
50|$|Besides {{asking the}} {{bartender}} for your desired number of Antlers, {{you are also}} able to order the <b>shots</b> nonverbally. Once <b>you</b> have {{the attention of the}} bartender, possibly by making deer noises from across the bar, simply bring your hands to your head, and denote the number of <b>shots</b> <b>you</b> want by holding up the same number of fingers as if your fingers were deer antlers. For example, if <b>you</b> wanted six <b>shots,</b> as in the accompanying picture, you could hold up three fingers with each hand.|$|R
5000|$|... "My first {{assignment}} was a re-entry story," [...] Peck remembers. [...] "What {{do you do}} when you're coming back after the flood? Do <b>you</b> need tetanus <b>shots?</b> Do <b>you</b> need hepatitis (<b>shots)?</b> What do <b>you</b> do if there are snakes in the water?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Think so?' said Lorimer doubtfully, {{in answer}} to the 'rattling good screed' passage of Pringle's speech. 'Well, I wish you'd have a <b>shot.</b> <b>You</b> might as well.' ...|$|E

5000|$|Before {{principal}} photography was complete, Wyler {{left for}} Rome to start work on Ben Hur, delegating {{creation of the}} final scenes involving McKay and Julie to his assistant Robert Swink, whose resulting scenes pleased Wyler {{so much that he}} wrote Swink a letter stating: [...] "I can't begin to tell you how pleased I am with the new ending... The <b>shots</b> <b>you</b> made are complete perfection." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, come; that settles the question, doesn't it? You must be {{shaken by}} your fall, {{or you would}} not talk like that, Higgs. Look, here runs the spoor--see the blood? Well, let's go steady and keep our wind. We may come on her anywhere, but don't you try any more long {{distance}} <b>shots.</b> <b>You</b> won't kill another lion at {{two hundred and fifty}} yards." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Diable, {{that was}} a good shot!" [...] he exclaimed, as his shako was struck from his head by a bullet. [...] "That is the worst of these fellows. They are uncommonly good <b>shots.</b> <b>You</b> see, almost all these {{mountain}} men are accustomed to carry guns, and the charcoal burners and shepherds eke out a living by shooting game and sending it down to the towns." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Get down, Bo, an' let's see {{how good}} a <b>shot</b> <b>you</b> are, said Dale. Bo slowly withdrew her fascinated gaze from the lion and looked with a rueful smile at Dale.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Why, yes," [...] said Momont. [...] "We had {{to bear a}} good deal, but we did bear it manfully and well. We {{were all}} led out to be <b>shot,</b> <b>you</b> know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No time to explain. I may be <b>shot,</b> <b>you</b> know, {{or taken}} prisoner, though the latter's not likely. In any case {{remember}} that I confess myself guilty! God bless you, dear, dear girl." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all. If they {{detected}} him, and I {{really do}} not {{see that there is}} a chance of their doing so, disguised as he was, they would have seized him and probably killed him, but there would be no firing. He has gone unarmed, you know, and would offer no resistance. Those <b>shots</b> <b>you</b> heard were doubtless the result of some drunken quarrel over the loot." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Boy, {{you must}} be daft, to tell me I don't know when I bring down a deer. The deer is mine, and if <b>you</b> <b>shot</b> at him <b>you</b> wasted your powder, that's all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What have <b>you</b> <b>shot?</b> {{what have}} <b>you</b> shot?" [...] cried a shrill and {{somewhat}} weak {{voice in the}} distance. In another moment {{the owner of the}} voice appeared, running eagerly towards the two men.|$|R
6000|$|... "Only {{that we were}} on the keen jump for Injins," [...] {{continued}} the stranger, [...] "we wouldn't have seen you at all, and might hev <b>shot</b> <b>you</b> when we did. What possessed you to stay here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I trust, Tom," [...] said Wilkins, [...] "that {{you will}} {{permit me to}} follow you. I am the worst <b>shot,</b> <b>you</b> know, and the worst and best should go {{together}} on the acknowledged principle that extremes meet." ...|$|E

5000|$|There {{are those}} who believe that the come shot, or, as some refer to it, the [...] "money shot," [...] is the most {{important}} element in the movie and that everything else (if necessary) should be sacrificed at its expense. Of course, this depends on the outlook of the producer, but the one thing is for sure: if you don't have the come <b>shots,</b> <b>you</b> don't have a porno picture.|$|R
5000|$|Players {{take the}} role of a cattle driver on the Chisholm Trail, {{bringing}} their cattle to set destinations while defending them against cattle rustlers and wranglers. The game has nine levels. You can choose any of the levels from the start menu and the level selected determines how long you have been on the trail, how many steers you have, how many <b>shots</b> <b>you</b> have, and how many wranglers and rustlers must be eliminated.|$|R
6000|$|... "Keep line, lads; steady!" [...] {{shouted the}} major {{as they neared}} the crest. [...] "Now {{get ready for a}} charge; go right at them. Don't fire a <b>shot</b> till <b>you</b> are within five paces, then give them three barrels of your revolvers; then at them with the sword; and keep your other <b>shots</b> in case <b>you</b> are pressed. Hurrah!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear, dear! Carried away by excitement, were you? You {{must really}} be more careful, Tell. One {{of these days}} you will be getting {{yourself}} into trouble. But {{it seems to have}} been a very fine <b>shot.</b> <b>You</b> are a capital marksman, I believe?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Don’t {{you believe}} me? Oh, you modest creature. Well, {{let me assure}} you that under {{ordinary}} circumstances {{it would have been a}} good <b>shot.</b> <b>You</b> are sufficiently remarkable. But you seem a pretty acute customer too. The circumstances are extraordinary. By Jove they are!” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aw, what's {{the good}} of talkin'? We got you red-handed. Right up there's where you left the trail when you heard him comin'. You laid among the trees an' bushwhacked him. A short <b>shot.</b> <b>You</b> couldn't 'a' missed. Pierre, go an' get that gun he dropped." ...|$|E
5000|$|After {{boarding}} a plane, you {{fly through}} a canyon. There {{are a few}} narrow stretches and ice particles are <b>shot</b> at <b>you.</b>|$|R
