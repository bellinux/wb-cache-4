40|$|FEROS is a fiber-fed {{bench-mounted}} prism-crossdispersed echelle spectro-graph for the ESO 1. 52 -m {{telescope at}} La Silla. It works in quasi Littrow mode and in white pupil configuration. For {{the object and}} the nearby sky, the complete optical spectrum from 370 – 860 nm is re-corded in one exposure with a resolving power of R = 48, 000 {{by the use of}} a two-beam, two-slice image slicer. A first concept of FEROS, which is supposed to replace ECHELEC at the 1. 52 -m telescope, was presented by Pasquini et al., 1992, “FEROS for the ESO 1. 52 -m Telescope”, 32 nd Scientific Technical Committee Meeting, Garch-ing. Designed as a fiber-linked spectro-graph connected to the permanently mounted Boller & Chivens spectrograph it has the advantage of being always available. The fibre entrance of FEROS is mounted on the <b>slit</b> <b>unit</b> of the Boller & Chivens spectrograph, and it will be pos-sible to change from one spectrograph to the other by a simple translation of the <b>slit</b> <b>unit.</b> Because FEROS provides high-dispersion spectroscopy with a wide, si-multaneous wavelength coverage, this instrument mounted on an intermediate-size telescope fills a gap in the present and future ESO instrumentation park. It will allow to realise many important sci-entific programmes (a few of which are described below) of objects down to about 16 th magnitude with high effi-ciency, little constraints on operations and will relieve the pressure on larger telescopes.

40|$|CYCLOPS 2 is {{an upgrade}} for the UCLES high {{resolution}} spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope, scheduled for commissioning in semester 2012 A. By replacing the 5 mirror Coudé train with a Cassegrain mounted fibre-based image slicer CYCLOPS 2 simultaneously provides improved throughput, reduced aperture losses and increased spectral resolution. Sixteen optical fibres collect {{light from a}} 5. 0 arcsecond^ 2 area of sky and reformat it into {{the equivalent of a}} 0. 6 arcsecond wide slit, delivering a spectral resolution of R = 70000 and up to twice as much flux as the standard 1 arcsecond slit of the Coudé train. CYCLOPS 2 also adds support for simultaneous ThAr wavelength calibration via a dedicated fibre. CYCLOPS 2 consists of three main components, the fore-optics unit, fibre bundle and <b>slit</b> <b>unit.</b> The fore optics unit incorporates magnification optics and a lenslet array and is designed to mount to the CURE Cassegrain instrument interface, which provides acquisition, guiding and calibration facilities. The fibre bundle transports the light from the Cassegrain focus to the UCLES spectrograph at Coudé and also includes a fibre mode scrambler. The <b>slit</b> <b>unit</b> consists of the fibre slit and relay optics to project an image of the slit onto the entrance aperture of the UCLES spectrograph. CYCLOPS 2 builds on experience with the first generation CYCLOPS fibre system, which we also describe in this paper. We present the science case for an image slicing fibre feed for echelle spectroscopy and describe the design of CYCLOPS and CYCLOPS 2. Comment: 9 pages, 6 figures, published in Proc. SPIE 844...|$|R
5000|$|MOSFIRE : MOSFIRE (Multi-Object Spectrometer for Infra-Red Exploration) {{is a third}} {{generation}} instrument for the W. M. Keck Observatory. MOSFIRE was delivered to Keck Observatory on February 8, 2012 and first light on the Keck I telescope was obtained on April 4, 2012. A Multi-Object Spectrograph For Infra-Red Exploration and wide-field camera for the near-infrared (0.97 to 2.41 μm), MOSFIRE's special feature is the cryogenic Configurable <b>Slit</b> <b>Unit</b> (CSU) that is reconfigurable under remote control in less than 6 minutes without any thermal cycling. Bars move in from each side to form up to 46 short slits. When the bars are removed MOSFIRE becomes a wide-field imager. The instrument was developed by teams from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and the University of California, Santa Cruz, (UCSC). The Co- Principal Investigators are Ian S. McLean (UCLA) and Charles C. Steidel (Caltech), and the project was managed by WMKO Instrument Program Manager, Sean Adkins. MOSFIRE was {{funded in part by}} the Telescope System Instrumentation Program (TSIP), which is operated by AURA and funded by the National Science Foundation, and by a private donation to WMKO by Gordon and Betty Moore.|$|R
40|$|EMIR {{is one of}} {{the first}} common user {{instruments}} for the GTC, the 10 meter telescope operating at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory (La Palma, Canary Islands, Spain). EMIR is being built by a Consortium of Spanish and French institutes led by the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias (IAC). EMIR is primarily designed to be operated as a MOS in the K band, but offers a wide range of observing modes, including imaging and spectroscopy, both long slit and multiobject, in the wavelength range 0. 9 to 2. 5 μm. This contribution reports on the results achieved so far during the verification phase at the IAC prior to its shipment to the GTC for being commissioned, which is due by mid 2015. After a long period of design and fabrication, EMIR finally entered into its integration phase by mid 2013. Soon after this, the verification phase at the IAC was initiated aimed at configuring and tuning the EMIR functions, mostly the instrument control system, which includes a sophisticated on line data reduction pipeline, and demonstrating the fulfillment of the top level requirements. We have designed an ambitious verification plan structured along the three kind of detectors at hand: the MUX and the engineering and scientific grade arrays. The EMIR subsystems are being integrated as they are needed for the purposes of the verification plan. In the first stage, using the MUX, the full optical system, but with a single dispersive element out of the three which form the EMIR suite, the two large wheels mounting the filters and the pseudo-grisms, plus the detector translation unit holding the MUX, were mounted. This stage was mainly devoted to learn about the capabilities of the instrument, define different settings for its basic operation modes and test the accuracy, repeatability and reliability of the mechanisms. In the second stage, using the engineering Hawaii 2 FPA, the full set of pseudo-grisms and band filters are mounted, which means that the instrument is fully assembled except for the cold <b>slit</b> <b>unit,</b> a robotic reconfigurable multislit mask system capable of forming multislit pattern of 55 different slitlets in the EMIR focal plane. This paper will briefly describe the principal units and features of the EMIR instrument as the main results of the verification performed so far are discussed.

40|$|A {{previously}} developed model describing colloidal fouling of membrane filters (Sethi, 1997) {{predicts that}} operation {{under conditions of}} constant transmembrane pressure should result in less fouling than operation at constant permeate flux. These predictions were tested {{in a series of}} laboratory experiments. The influence of particle size and mode of operation on the specific permeate flux performance of a cross-flow flat <b>slit</b> membrane <b>unit,</b> was evaluated using an ultra-filtration membrane mounted in an existing Osmonics SEPA CF membrane module. Experiments of three hours in duration were conducted with polystyrene latex particles (100 nm, 430 nm, and 1000 nm) which resulted in a strong correlation between particle size and specific permeate flux. Consistent with theoretical prediction, less fouling was observed in a constant pressure mode of operation. However difference in between the two modes of operation with different particle sizes were not as great as anticipated. Indications for a strong influence of the flowing layer on the specific permeate flux performance were found for the 1000 nm particles. Future research for {{a better understanding of the}} role of the flowing layer and cake resistance in membrane fouling is needed and recommended...|$|R
40|$|We {{perform a}} {{detailed}} study of the gamma-ray burst GRB 091127 /SN 2009 nz host galaxy at z= 0. 490 using the VLT/X-shooter spectrograph in <b>slit</b> and integral-field <b>unit</b> (IFU). From {{the analysis of the}} optical and X-ray afterglow data obtained from ground-based telescopes and Swift-XRT we confirm the presence of a bump associated with SN 2009 nz and find evidence of a possible jet break in the afterglow lightcurve. The X-shooter afterglow spectra reveal several emission lines from the underlying host, from which we derive its integrated properties. These are in agreement with those of previously studied GRB-SN hosts and, more generally, with those of the long GRB host population. We use the Hubble Space Telescope and ground based images of the host to determine its stellar mass (M_star). Our results extend to lower M_star values the M-Z plot derived for the sample of long GRB hosts at 0. 3 <z< 1. 0 adding new information to probe the faint end of the M-Z relation and the shift of the LGRB host M-Z relation from that found from emission line galaxy surveys. Thanks to the IFU spectroscopy we can build the 2 D velocity, velocity dispersion and star formation rate (SFR) maps. They show that the host galaxy has a perturbed rotation kinematics with evidence of a SFR enhancement consistent with the afterglow position.

40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of proteinuria {{associated with}} immune complex disease is incompletely understood. A quantitative electron-microscopic study was undertaken {{to determine the}} relative contribution of lesions in capillary loops and mesangial basement membrane areas and their possible correlations to urinary protein excretion data. Pathologic features including the loss of foot processes (and slit diaphragms), the formation of junctional complexes in visceral epithelium, {{and the distribution of}} immune complexes in basement membrane were assessed in glomeruli of mice with lupus nephritis. Swiss albino mice served as control animals. In control animals the distribution of split pores per unit length of basement membrane was approximately 60 % higher in capillary loop compared to mesangial basement membrane areas. In mice with lupus nephritis, the {{reduction in the number of}} <b>slit</b> pores per <b>unit</b> length of basement membrane to 30 % or less of normal, the formation of epithelial junctions, and the relative distribution of immune complexes were not statistically different in capillary versus mesangial basement membrane areas. Animals with murine lupus showed poorly selective proteinuria, but the correlation between features studied and extent of protein excretion was poor. The results of these studies 1) establish the relative distribution of slit pores in mesangial and peripheral loop basement membrane, 2) demonstrate that glomerular changes associated with immune complex deposition are comparable in capillary and mesangial basement membrane areas, and 3) are consistent with a focal and nonuniform alteration in glomerular permeability properties associated with immune complex disease...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Mimir, a new facility-class {{near-infrared}} {{instrument for}} the 1. 8 m Perkins telescope on Anderson Mesa outside Flagstaff, Arizona, was commissioned {{and has been}} operating for three years. Mimir is multifunction, performing wide-field (F= 5) and narrow-field (F= 17) imaging, long-slit spectroscopy, and imaging polarimetry. The F= 5 mode images at 0. 59 ″ per pixel onto the 1024 × 1024 pixel ALADDIN III InSb array detector, giving a 100 × 100 field of view. In the F= 17 mode, the plate scale is 0. 18 ″ per pixel. Optically, Mimir is a refractive reimager for the F= 17 : 5 Perkins beam. A six-lens collimator produces an achromatic 25 mm pupil, which is imaged by a five-lens camera (F= 5), a four-lens camera (F= 17), or a two-lens pupil viewer onto the detector. Three filter wheels precede the pupil, one follows the pupil. The wheels contain a rotating half-wave plate, broadband filters, narrowband filters, grisms, long-pass filters, a wire grid, and thermal IR blockers. The first telescope focus is within Mimir, where a <b>slit</b> and decker <b>unit,</b> consisting of two linear motion cars, selects one of 13 slit scenes. The slit and decker cars, the four filter wheels, the half-wave plate rotation, and the camera selector are all driven by stepper motors within the cold vacuum space. Cooling is provided by a CTI 1050 two-stage, closed-cycle helium refrigerator, keeping the optics, filters, and internal surfaces between 65 and 75 K and the detector at 33. 5 K. Switching between Mimir’s different modes takes only a few seconds, making it a versatile tool for conducting {{a wide range of}} investigations and for quickly reacting to changing observing conditions.

40|$|The {{development}} of the Small Deflection Energy Analyzer (SDEA) charged-particle spectrometer for energy and angle distributions responds to a longstanding need to measure the wind velocity vector in Earth s thermosphere, and to obtain the ion-drift vector in the ionosphere. The air and ions above 120 km are endowed with bulk velocities and temperatures just like air near the ground, but with separate spatial and temporal variations. It {{is important to understand}} these not only for study of the physics and chemistry of the Sun-Earth connection, but also for spacecraft orbit predictions, and communications through the ionosphere. The SDEA consists of a pair of parallel conducting plates separated by a small distance, with an entrance slit on one end, and an exit slit on the other. A voltage applied to these plates develops an electric field between the plates, and this field deflects ions passing through it. If an ion has too little energy, it will strike one of the plates. If it has too much, it will strike the back wall. An ion with the amount of energy being searched for will have its trajectory bent just enough to exit the back <b>slit.</b> The SDEA <b>units</b> are compact, rectangular, and operate with low voltages. The units can be built up into small arrays. These arrays could be used either to widen the field of view or to sharpen an existing one. This approach {{can also be used to}} obtain angular distributions in two planes simultaneously, thus cutting down the ion source power requirements in half. This geometry has enabled a new mass-spectrometer concept that can provide miniaturized mass spectrometers for use in industrial plants, air-pollution monitoring, and noxious-gas detection...|$|R
40|$|Context. We {{continue}} our investigation {{on how the}} cluster environment affects the evolution of galaxies. Aims. By examining both galaxy structure and internal kinematics of cluster galaxies at lookback times of similar to 5 Gyr we study the nature and impact of possible interactions at the peak epoch of cluster assembly. Methods. Going beyond our previous measurements of two-dimensional rotation curves, we here observe the whole velocity field of the galaxies of the sample. We achieve a complete coverage and optimal spatial sampling of galaxy sizes by placing three adjacent and parallel FORS 2 MXU (Mask eXchange <b>Unit)</b> <b>slits</b> onto each object yielding simultaneously several emission and absorption lines. We reconstruct the gas velocity field and decompose it into circular rotation and irregular motions using a harmonic decomposition method called kinemetry. To measure the irregularity in the gas kinematics, we de. ne 3 parameters: sigma(PA) (the standard deviation of the kinematic position angle within a galaxy), Delta phi (the average misalignment between kinematic and photometric position angles) and k(3, 5) (squared sum of the higher order Fourier terms). Results. We present {{the analysis of the}} velocity fields and morphology of 22 distant galaxies in the MS 0451. 6 - 0305 field with 11 members at z = 0. 54 and a local sample from SINGS. Using local, undistorted galaxies the three parameters sigma(PA), Delta phi and k(3, 5) can be used to establish the regularity of the gas velocity fields. Among the galaxies for which we could measure these parameters, we find both field ones (4 of 8) and cluster members (3 of 4), which have a velocity field that we consider both irregular and asymmetric. We show that these fractions are underestimates {{of the total number of}} objects with irregular velocity fields. The values of the irregularity parameters for cluster galaxies are not very different from those of the field galaxies, implying that there are isolated field galaxies that are as distorted as the cluster members. None of the deviations in our small sample correlate with photometric/structural properties like luminosity or disk scale length in a significant way. Conclusions. We have demonstrated that our 3 D-spectroscopic method successfully maps the velocity field of distant galaxies. Together with a structural analysis the importance and efficiency of cluster specific interactions can be assessed quantitatively...|$|R
40|$|The Savannah River Site disposes {{of certain}} types of {{radioactive}} waste within subsurface-engineered facilities. One of the tools used to establish the capacity of a given site to safely store radioactive waste (i. e., that a site does not exceed its Waste Acceptance Criteria) is the Performance Assessment (PA). The objective of this document is to provide the geochemical values for the PA calculations. This work is being conducted {{as part of the}} on-going maintenance program that permits the PA to periodically update existing calculations when new data becomes available. Because application of values without full understanding of their original purpose may lead to misuse, this document also provides the geochemical conceptual model, approach used for selecting the values, the justification for selecting data, and the assumptions made to assure that the conceptual and numerical geochemical models are reasonably conservative (i. e., reflect conditions that will tend to predict the maximum risk to the hypothetical recipient). The geochemical parameters describe transport processes for 38 elements (> 90 radioisotopes) potentially occurring within eight disposal <b>units</b> (<b>Slit</b> Trenches, Engineered Trenches, Low Activity Waste (LAW) Vault, Intermediate Level (ILV) Vaults, TRU-Pad- 1, Naval Reactor Waste Pads, Components-in-Grout Trenches, and Saltstone Facility). This work builds upon well-documented work from previous PA calculations (McDowell-Boyer et al. 2000). The new geochemical concepts introduced in this data package are: (1) In the past, solubility products were used only in a few conditions (element existing in a specific environmental setting). This has been expanded to > 100 conditions. (2) Radionuclide chemistry in cementitious environments is described through the use of both the Kd and apparent solubility concentration limit. Furthermore, the solid phase is assumed to age during the assessment period (thousands of years), resulting in three main types of controlling solid phases, each possessing a unique set of radionuclide sorption parameters (Kd and solubility concentration limit). (3) A large amount of recent site-specific sorption research has been conducted since the last PA (McDowell-Boyer et al. 2000). These new data have replaced previous Kd values derived from literature values, thus reducing uncertainty and improving accuracy. Finally, because this document will be used by future PA calculations and external acceptance of the document will eventually be required, this document was extensively reviewed. The review process, including the internal review, site review, and external review process is described...|$|R
40|$|The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL), in {{response}} to a request from Solid Waste Management (SWM), conducted a Special Analysis (SA) to evaluate the performance of nineteen heat exchangers that are to be disposed in the E-Area low level waste facility Slit Trench 9 (ST 9). Although these nineteen heat exchangers were never decontaminated, the majority of the radionuclides in the heat exchanger inventory list were determined to be acceptable for burial because they are less than the 'generic' waste form inventory limits given in the 2008 Performance Assessment (PA) (WSRC, 2008). However, as generic waste, the H- 3 and C- 14 inventories resulted in unacceptable sum-of-fractions (SOFs). Initial scoping analyses performed by SRNL indicated that if alterations were made to certain external nozzles to mitigate various potential leak paths, acceptable SOFs could be achieved {{through the use of a}} 'Special' waste form. This SA provides the technical basis for this new 'Special' waste form and provides the inventory limits for H- 3 and C- 14 for these nineteen heat exchangers such that the nineteen heat exchangers can be disposed in ST 9. This 'Special' waste form is limited to these nineteen heat exchangers in ST 9 and applies for H- 3 and C- 14, which are designated as H- 3 X and C- 14 X, respectively. The SA follows the same methodology used in the 2008 PA and the 2008 SA except for the modeling enhancements noted below. Infiltration rates above the heat exchangers are identical to those used in the 2008 PA; however, flow through the heat exchangers is unique. Because it is unknown exactly how sealed heat exchanger openings will perform and how surface and embedded contaminants will be released, multiple base cases or scenarios were established to investigate a set of performances. Each scenario consists of flow options (based on the performance of sealed openings) and a near-field release of contaminants (based on corrosion and diffusion performance). Two disposal configurations were analyzed where heat exchangers were assumed to be disposed four across and five lengthwise (the 4 x 5 configuration, with one empty) and three across and seven lengthwise (the 3 x 7 configuration, with two empty). A large range of conditions was considered. For example, peak well concentrations at the 100 -m boundary for H- 3 are shown in Figure ES- 1 for a wide range of configurations (i. e. release mechanism and degree of sealing options). The maximum contaminant level (MCL) and a 10 % SOF goal for H- 3 are also shown. The 10 % goal was based on an estimated volume fraction that these nineteen heat exchangers would consume in ST 9 and was solely used for scoping purposes to assess disposal feasibility and sealing requirements. Because various line breaks and poor sealing greatly exceeded that 10 % goal, the determination was made that mitigating activities were needed, such as protection from line breaks and better sealing. An initial set of scenarios was run to assess the requirements for sealing the heat exchanger openings and the need to ensure that the sealed heat exchangers stayed sealed during transit and disposal operations. After discovering that such mitigating activities were required, additional scenarios were run that included the mitigating activities. Scenarios deemed to have a very low probability of occurrence were excluded from consideration for calculating inventory limits (for example, those scenarios that assumed an instantaneous release of contaminants along with poor sealing). The SA used the most recent K{sub d} values for the C- 14 analyses and the most recent Dose Conversion Factors for H- 3 and C- 14 which have been updated since the 2008 PA was issued. This SA took into account the location and the disposal timing of these heat exchangers. The disposal location is within a small area of the overall <b>Slit</b> Trench <b>unit</b> (about 6 % of the total) and is behind a line that is 200 ft from the down-gradient edge of ST 9. The disposal timing is assumed to be after July 1, 2012 (because disposals cannot occur until this document is approved and mitigating activities are completed) which means that the disposal occurs after the first time period for the 2008 PA beta-gamma pathway (that time period is from December 1995 until December 2007), thus that pathway time period is not considered. Table ES- 1 provides new 'Special' waste form groundwater pathway inventory limits for C- 14 X and H- 3 X in the heat exchangers. Inventory limits for generic C- 14 and H- 3 in the West Slit Trenches are included for comparison. The lowest limit for generic C- 14 is 1. 9 E- 1 Ci, while for C- 14 X it is 2. 7 E 0, an increase of more than 14 times. Because time windows are employed, at later times C- 14 X exhibits lower limits than those for generic C- 14 because with its smaller K{sub d} the C- 14 moves much faster. The lowest limit for generic H- 3 is 3. 6 E 0 Ci, while for H- 3 X it is 1. 7 E 3, an increase of almost 500 times...|$|R
