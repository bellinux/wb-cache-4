25|$|Dissection in U.S. {{high schools}} became {{prominent}} in 1987, when a California student, Jenifer Graham, sued to require her school {{to let her}} complete an alternative project. The court ruled that mandatory dissections were permissible, but that Graham could ask to dissect a frog that had {{died of natural causes}} rather than one that was killed for the purposes of dissection; the practical impossibility of procuring a frog that had died of natural causes in effect let Graham opt out of the required dissection. The suit gave publicity to anti-dissection advocates. Graham appeared in a 1987 Apple Computer commercial for the virtual-dissection software Operation Frog. The state of California passed a Student's Rights Bill in 1988 requiring that objecting <b>students</b> <b>be</b> allowed to complete alternative projects. Opting out of dissection increased through the 1990s.|$|E

The studio also cast 200 extras for various school scenes, including one in the pool, but required that all auditioning <b>students</b> <b>be</b> at least 16 years old.

2500|$|During {{the time}} that Akers was alive, till 1966, money was {{allocated}} to paint and display the engine. In 1969, a group of MSU students formed the Michigan State University Railroad Club as a railfan group. Steve Reeves, a student and part-time employee of the Museum, whose responsibility was to display the engine on football weekends, sent out a notice in the State News that the Railroad Club would be meeting. [...] Those early meetings did not discuss {{the restoration of the}} engine. [...] Instead, they were slide shows of engines various members had seen on trips across the US, most of which were diesels. In 1970, at the suggestion of Randy Paquette, the club investigated the possibility of restoring the locomotive to running condition and started on that goal in 1971, with Baker's permission. Baker later stated that he thought having <b>students</b> <b>be</b> occupied with restoring a locomotive was far more in keeping with his idea of the image the university should be presenting than campus protests. [...] Dr. Breslin, the university vice president, was not so sure. [...] After the club started removing the sheet metal and exposing a rusty boiler, Breslin sent Baker to the engine with two messages. The first was the instruction to paint the engine. (The university needs to look good, even when it is being worked on). The second message was the day the students stop working on the engine is the day the torches come out. [...] The locomotive was safe as long as the students kept working on it. To emphasize, he had the hopper car next to the engine cut up the next week.|$|E

6000|$|We {{boast that}} we {{belong to the}} Nineteenth Century and are making the most rapid strides of any nation. But {{consider}} how little this village does for its own culture. I {{do not wish to}} flatter my townsmen, nor to be flattered by them, for that will not advance either of us. We need to be provoked--goaded like oxen, as we are, into a trot. We have a comparatively decent system of common schools, schools for infants only; but excepting the half-starved Lyceum in the winter, and latterly the puny beginning of a library suggested by the State, no school for ourselves. We spend more on almost any article of bodily aliment or ailment than on our mental aliment. It is time that we had uncommon schools, that we did not leave off our education when we begin to be men and women. It is time that villages were universities, and their elder inhabitants the fellows of universities, with leisure--if they are, indeed, so well off--to pursue liberal studies the rest of their lives. Shall the world be confined to one Paris or one Oxford forever? Cannot <b>students</b> <b>be</b> boarded here and get a liberal education under the skies of Concord? Can we not hire some Abelard to lecture to us? Alas! what with foddering the cattle and tending the store, we are kept from school too long, and our education is sadly neglected. In this country, the village should in some respects take the place of the nobleman of Europe. It should be the patron of the fine arts. It is rich enough. It wants only the magnanimity and refinement. It can spend money enough on such things as farmers and traders value, but it is thought Utopian to propose spending money for things which more intelligent men know to be of far more worth. This town has spent seventeen thousand dollars on a town-house, thank fortune or politics, but probably it will not spend so much on living wit, the true meat to put into that shell, in a hundred years. The one hundred and twenty-five dollars annually subscribed for a Lyceum in the winter is better spent than any other equal sum raised in the town. If we live in the Nineteenth Century, why should we not enjoy the advantages which the Nineteenth Century offers? Why should our life be in any respect provincial? If we will read newspapers, why not skip the gossip of Boston and take the best newspaper in the world at once?--not be sucking the pap of [...] "neutral family" [...] papers, or browsing [...] "Olive Branches" [...] here in New England. Let the reports of all the learned societies come to us, and we will see if they know anything. Why should we leave it to Harper & Brothers and Redding & Co. to select our reading? As the nobleman of cultivated taste surrounds himself with whatever conduces to his culture--genius--learning--wit--books-- paintings--statuary--music--philosophical instruments, and the like; so let the village do--not stop short at a pedagogue, a parson, a sexton, a parish library, and three selectmen, because our Pilgrim forefathers got through a cold winter once on a bleak rock with these. To act collectively is according to the spirit of our institutions; and I am confident that, as our circumstances are more flourishing, our means are greater than the nobleman's. New England can hire all the wise men in the world to come and teach her, and board them round the while, and not be provincial at all. That is the uncommon school we want. Instead of noblemen, let us have noble villages of men. If it is necessary, omit one bridge over the river, go round a little there, and throw one arch at least over the darker gulf of ignorance which surrounds us.|$|E
