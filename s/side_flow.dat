50|$|Tubular Forced Circulation Evaporators employs an axial {{circulation}} pump which navigates {{the flow of}} liquid in a circular motion through the system’s heat exchanger {{in which it is}} superheated. Thereafter, when the liquid reaches the separator the liquid pressure decreases dramatically forcing a portion of the liquid to be rapidly boiled off. This design is specifically for products and/ or particulates with a diameter of over 2mm. As the evaporation action occurs only in the separator and not in the heat exchanger, fouling is reduced despite higher levels of turbulence in the design. Alternatively, another design parameter is the optimisation of liquid velocity in the tube <b>side</b> <b>flow</b> which is regulated by the {{circulation pump}}.|$|E

Effect of cutting feed on the maximum scallop height of machining surface is researched and microscopic observation of surface topography is made through the hard cutting experiment. In certain conditions, the machining surface roughness and the cutting off trace increase with cutting feed.

30|$|Ultra-precision cutting {{is one of}} {{the most}} common methods in realizing the nanometric surface {{roughness}} and sub-micrometric form accuracy. Based on the assumption that the workpiece material is removed ideally and the machined surface texture is the replication of tool nose profile, the surface roughness could attain nanometric even sub-nanometric scale, if simply decreasing the feed and increasing the tool nose radius. However, it always deviates from its ideal value due to many factors, such as, material properties of workpiece [1 – 4] and cutting tool geometry [5 – 7]. The <b>side</b> <b>flow</b> of workpiece material, which is a result of the interactions between cutting tool and workpiece material, is considered to be an important role in causing the deviation [8]. It is the plastic deformation of workpiece material at a direction opposite to the feed direction [9]. Two mechanisms are proposed to describe the formation of material <b>side</b> <b>flow</b> [7]. The first one is the squeeze between the tool flank face and the machined surface especially when the uncut chip thickness (UCT) is less than the minimum uncut chip thickness. The second one is due to the trailing edge notch. The material is pressed aside under high temperature and pressure. Material <b>side</b> <b>flow</b> has been modeled by 3 D thermo elasto-viscoplastic finite element method and found that more <b>side</b> <b>flow</b> is generated with higher nose radius and lower feed [10]. The <b>side</b> <b>flow</b> of material has been taken into account to predict the machined surface roughness [8, 11].|$|E

30|$|When cutting {{with the}} { 100 }[*]<[*] 011 [*]>[*]direction whose <b>side</b> <b>flow</b> is the smallest, atoms do not {{flow to the}} side until {{a small amount of}} atoms reach the {{shearing}} plane. The flow up region in front of the cutting tool is bounded by the shearing plane which expands from the tip of the stagnation region as shown in Fig.  5 c. Similar results are obtained when cutting with the direction of { 110 }[*]<[*] 1 – 10 >. But more material flows {{to the side of the}} cutting edge forming the relatively larger <b>side</b> <b>flow</b> on the machined surface. With the cutting direction of { 110 }[*]<[*] 001 >, the shearing plane is the twin boundary, as shown in Fig.  5 e, which expands under the tool edge. Therefore, large part of material flow up in front of the tool edge and small part of material flow to the side of the tool edge. Thus it can be seen that the <b>side</b> <b>flow</b> is influenced by the anisotropic nature of the material. At different cutting directions, the size of the <b>side</b> <b>flow</b> has great difference which would finally affect the machined surface quality. Therefore, the cutting directions of { 100 }[*]<[*] 011 >, { 110 }[*]<[*] 001 >, and { 110 }[*]<[*] 1 – 10 [*]>[*]are beneficial to obtain a better surface quality. For further increasing the machined surface quality, the feed and the tool geometry could be optimized which are discussed in the next sections.|$|E
