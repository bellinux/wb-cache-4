Volatile sulfur compounds, including volatile organic sulfur compounds (VOSCs) and hydrogen sulfide, have been reported as the most odorous compounds in digestion emissions and impurities which can damage facilities for generation, transportation, storage, and utilization of biogas.

The kinetics for the identified VOSC degradation and conversion processes were determined at 35 and 55 °C respectively. Mixed-second order kinetics were found to best fit the conversion processes. A model was established based on the identified processes and estimated kinetic constants. To extend the model to VOSC release in anaerobic <b>sludge</b> <b>digestion,</b> mesophilic and thermophilic incubations were conducted with four different sludge samples.

The model simulations for VOSC behavior in thermophilic batch incubation were able to represent the observed VOSC releases. However, the simulations could not well fit the observed VOSC release at 35 ° because the model did not include the unidentified DMS generation mechanism. Application of the model to bench-scale digesters was lack-of-fit. It may have been due to imprecise estimation of the degradable sulfur in the feed sludge.

Although further increase of AR addition decreased the concentrations of both soluble COD and VFA, their contents in these systems with AR addition at any concentration investigated were still higher {{than those in the}} blank, which resulted in higher methane yields in these systems.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In designated nutrient-sensitive areas, phosphorus must be removed from sewage before it is discharged to the receiving water body. Phosphorus-rich sludge is generated, which is usually digested anaerobically prior to disposal. This research investigated the effect of phosphorus enrichment on metal and phosphorus fractionation in anaerobically digested sludge. The use of two complementary sequential chemical extraction procedures to measure phosphorus and metal fractionation, was a key focus of the research. The fractionation procedures were tested by sequentially extracting inorganic compounds (phosphates, sulphides and carbonates) which showed that the operationally defined metal and phosphorus fractions were not always representative of precise metal phases. Species were tentatively assigned to metal and phosphorus fractions using model compound results. Laboratory-scale batch anaerobic digestion experiments were performed, in which model compounds were used to simulate conditions of soluble and insoluble phosphorus enrichment. Soluble phosphorus at concentrations of 500 mg/l or greater was found to retard volatile solids removal and methane production in the laboratory digesters. Soluble phosphorus enrichment facilitated precipitation of calcium, magnesium and manganese but increased trace metal solubility, particularly that of chromium. Enrichment of digesters with Na 2 HP 04 and MgCb caused struvite to precipitate in digesters containing 1000 mg/l of additional phosphorus. FeP 04 enrichment of digested sludge showed that ferric iron was reduced to ferrous iron, releasing soluble phosphorus into the digester. Most of the phosphorus was reprecipitated as ferrous phosphate, causing co-precipitation of magnesium, manganese and cobalt. By contrast, A 1 P 04 added to the digesters was stable in the sludge. Full-scale CPR <b>sludge</b> <b>digestion</b> (Fe 2 (S 04) 3 dosing) caused soluble phosphorus in the digester to decrease below 0. 05 mg/l. Phosphorus remained associated with iron in the sludge fraction but soluble calcium and magnesium concentrations in the full-scale digester increased {{as a result of}} CPR <b>sludge</b> <b>digestion.</b> Comparison of laboratory and full-scale results showed that the fate of iron-precipitated phosphorus in digested sludge was primarily dependent pn the molar ratio of Fe:P in the sludge.

The ammonium load, that in this way can be recycled to the facility, can contribute 30 % of the total ammonium loading. Because of this additional ammonia freight, a clarification plant requires larger activated sludge tanks {{and the need for}} oxygen increases, i. e., higher investment and energy costs arise in the treatment of the waste water. In a Fraunhofer IGB project, the filtrate of a biological <b>sludge</b> <b>digestion</b> developed at the IGB was studied. This wash water containing sludge has, because of the higher degree of decomposition in the <b>sludge</b> <b>digestion,</b> a higher ammonium content of 2 g/L than the wash water containing sludge in conventional clarification plants. Also, this muddy water is free of particles and microorganisms for the necessary microfiltration. These prerequisites permit the cost effective obtaining of the ammoni um from the sludge filtrate. To separate the ammonium from the muddy water, a hollow fiber membrane contactor is used. The filtrate is stripped with air. The ammonia laden air is washed with acids or freed of its ammonia load by cooling. Marketable products are thus obtained of ammonium salts such as fertilizer or ammonia solution for flue gas desulfurization. With this process the ammonium concentration in the muddy water can be reduced to over 99 % without pH elevation. A higher pH value can considerably accelerate the ammonium removal by the shift of the ammonium/ammonia equilibrium. The addition of alkali has the disadvantage that the waste water becomes loaded with chemicals, in this case, dissolved salts. Technically worthwhile is the ammonium reduction by 90 - 95 % that can be made with the "saved" energy through smaller ammonium loads in the clarification plant...|$|E
