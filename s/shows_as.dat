5|$|Executives at Tetragrammaton Records, Deep Purple's American label, {{thought that}} it would have been more {{profitable}} to have a new album to promote during the US tour, besides the already successful Shades of Deep Purple. Moreover, the eight tracks recorded in May for Deep Purple's debut album and performed live in the British gigs of July and August were deemed insufficient for their <b>shows</b> <b>as</b> headliners in the US. For these reasons, they were pushed back into the studio just a couple of months before the tour began, even though their debut album had not been released in the United Kingdom yet.|$|E
5|$|From the {{renovation}} in 1980 until 1985 the non-profit 5th Avenue Theatre successfully operated as {{a venue for}} touring Broadway <b>shows.</b> <b>As</b> the United States went through an economic downturn from 1985 to 1989 there was a shortage of touring shows for venues like the 5th. Consequently, many of the country's Broadway houses went unused for extended periods of time. However, the 5th remained open during these years with a reduced staff and was used for community events and local promoters.|$|E

5|$|When the Italian {{physicist}} Galileo Galilei first {{observed the}} planet in the early 17thcentury, he found it showed phases like the Moon, varying from crescent to gibbous to full and vice versa. When Venus is furthest from the Sun in the sky, it shows a half-lit phase, {{and when it is}} closest to the Sun in the sky, it <b>shows</b> <b>as</b> a crescent or full phase. This could be possible only if Venus orbited the Sun, and this was among the first observations to clearly contradict the Ptolemaic geocentric model that the Solar System was concentric and centred on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2000, Hi-5 have {{performed}} annually at Vision Australia's Carols by Candlelight in Melbourne, which are broadcast {{live by the}} Nine Network on Christmas Eve.

Several members have noted the <b>shows</b> <b>as</b> a highlight {{of their time in}} the group and over the years it became common for the performance to be the final concert of departing members. Hi-5 did not perform at the Carols between 2013 and 2015, and during this time, appeared at local Christmas events. Hi-5 returned to Carols by Candlelight in 2016 as part of their reestablished partnership with Nine.|$|E

5|$|In 1993, a new {{band called}} Inveigh Catharsis formed in Des Moines, with Gray on bass, Brainard on guitar and Colsefni on drums. Jordison jammed {{occasionally}} with this group. Brainard eventually left to join Jordison and Jones in Modifidious, participating in demo recordings {{at the end}} of '93 and early in '94. During 1994 Modifidious sometimes played the same <b>shows</b> <b>as</b> Crahan's Heads on the Wall band. Gray formed a death metal band called Body Pit, soon becoming popular in the local scene. Modifidious stopped playing in the wake of death metal's increasing pull. Gray failed to get Jordison to join Body Pit, but soon after he recruited local guitar teacher Mick Thomson, the band broke up.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the cast}} members {{at the time were}} {{relatively}} unknown actors—Texans who had played roles in commercials, television, and stage <b>shows,</b> <b>as</b> well as performers whom Hooper knew personally, such as Allen Danziger and Jim Siedow. Involvement in the film propelled some of them into the motion picture industry. The lead role of Sally was given to Marilyn Burns, who had appeared previously on stage and served on the film commission board at UT Austin while studying there. Teri McMinn was a student who worked with local theater companies, including the Dallas Theater Center. Henkel called McMinn to come in for a reading after he spotted her picture in the Austin American-Statesman. For her last call-back he requested that she wear short shorts, which proved to be the most comfortable of all the cast members' costumes.|$|E

5|$|The 8-track {{tapes of}} the three shows were {{carefully}} put in storage by Warner Bros. Japan for future use. For the album's 21st anniversary in 1993, Deep Purple author and archivist Simon Robinson decided to enquire via the band's management if the tapes could be located. He discovered the entire show had been recorded well, including all the encores. In July, Robinson and Darron Goodwin remixed the tapes at Abbey Road Studios for an expanded edition, that was then mastered by Peter Mew in September. To compromise between including {{as much of the}} <b>shows</b> <b>as</b> possible and setting a realistic price that most fans would accept, they decided to release a 3-CD box set, titled Live in Japan. This included all {{of the three}} main shows except for two tracks already available on the original album. In their place were two previously unreleased encores.|$|E
5|$|The {{duration}} of each touring show was traditionally split into two acts of an hour each separated by a 30-minute interval; however, as of 2014, due to cost cutting issues, the shows have now {{been reduced to a}} shorter 55-minute first act followed by a 50-minute second act, still including a 30-minute interval. Permanent shows are usually 90 minutes in length without any intermission. This excludes Joyà (the permanent show in Riviera Maya, Mexico), which is only 70 minutes in length. Typically touring <b>shows</b> <b>as</b> well as resident shows perform a standard 10 shows a week. Touring shows usually have one 'dark day' (with no performances) while resident shows have two.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} date for Corgis {{appearing in the}} show ring in Wales is 1925. Captain J. P. Howell called together a meeting of breeders of both the Pembroke and the Cardigan varieties, and formed the Welsh Corgi Club, with an initial membership of 59 members. A general breed standard was drawn up, and Corgis {{began to appear in}} conformation shows. Until this point, neither breed had been specifically bred for looks. Members of this club were primarily interested in the Pembroke variety, although the Cardigan variety also appeared. At that point the breeds were referred to as the Pembrokeshire and Cardiganshire varieties; the names were later shortened. There were a number of disputes between breeders of the two types in early <b>shows,</b> <b>as</b> judges who were breeders of one type would often favour them. The Welsh Corgi appeared at Crufts {{for the first time in}} 1927.|$|E

5|$|The son of Harry Church Whorf and Sarah Edna Lee Whorf, Benjamin Lee Whorf {{was born}} on April 24, 1897 in Winthrop, Massachusetts. Harry Church Whorf was an artist, {{intellectual}} and designer– first working as a commercial artist and later as a dramatist. Benjamin had two younger brothers, John and Richard, who both {{went on to become}} notable artists. John became an internationally renowned painter and illustrator; Richard was an actor in films such as Yankee Doodle Dandy and later an Emmy-nominated television director of such <b>shows</b> <b>as</b> The Beverly Hillbillies. Benjamin was the intellectual of the three and at a young age he conducted chemical experiments with his father's photographic equipment. He was also an avid reader, interested in botany, astrology, and Middle American prehistory. He read William H. Prescott's Conquest of Mexico several times. At the age of 17 he began to keep a copious diary in which he recorded his thoughts and dreams.|$|E
5|$|Following his leaving, Mitsuda {{has only}} worked on one more {{original}} game with Square, composing for 1999's Chrono Cross, {{the sequel to}} Chrono Trigger. He has worked on over a dozen games since then, including the spiritual sequel to Xenogears, , and major titles such as Shadow Hearts and Luminous Arc. In addition to video games, Mitsuda has composed music for the anime Inazuma Eleven and for the independent album Kirite. On November 22, 2001, Mitsuda formed Procyon Studio as a company to produce his music, along with a record label, Sleigh Bells. The company consisted of only Mitsuda as composer {{along with a few}} sound producers for several years, but has since expanded to include six employees. Mitsuda and Procyon Studio have also produced more arranged albums, such as Sailing to the World and 2009's Colours of Light, a compilation album of vocal pieces Mitsuda has composed. The studio was also involved in co-designing the KORG DS-10 synthesizer program for the Nintendo DS, and its successor for the Nintendo 3DS, KORG M01D. Mitsuda claims that, for the projects Procyon had been working on in the late 2000s, he was focusing more on working as a music producer for a team of artists rather than just as a composer. Despite that, Mitsuda continued to compose for several notable games in the 2010s, such as the Inazuma Eleven series, Soul Sacrifice, Xenoblade Chronicles 2, and Valkyria Revolution, with the latter marking his first fully solo game soundtrack in eight years. Around the same time, Mitsuda also began to compose for non-video game media, including several NHK-produced television <b>shows,</b> <b>as</b> well as anime series such as Black Butler and adaptions of Inazuma Eleven.|$|E
