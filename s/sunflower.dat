The later scene of Vincent van Gogh attempting to paint <b>sunflowers</b> a century before the auction has been noted by several critics. Peter Rainer wrote in 1990 that [...] "The scene where he destroys his canvasses {{in a field of}} <b>sunflowers</b> has an almost oracular power. In moments like these Altman gets so far inside Vincent's impacted agonies that the effect is almost dizzying." [...] Roger Ebert wrote of [...] "a remarkable scene in a field of <b>sunflowers,</b> where, as van Gogh paints, Altman's camera darts restlessly, aggressively, at the flowers, turning them from passive subjects into an alien hostile environment. The film is able to see the <b>sunflowers</b> as Altman believed van Gogh saw them." ...|$|R
