25|$|Bisociation: This is a {{technical}} term coined by Arthur Koestler. He {{says that a}} funny text is situated in two different semantic levels. In the beginning, the hearer or reader is aware of only one of them. In the punch line, the second level comes up so <b>suddenly</b> <b>that</b> they start laughing. The sudden coming up of the second level is the point. For example: I only want your best – your money.|$|E
25|$|When {{camouflage}} {{fails to}} protect them, blue-tongued skinks {{will try to}} ward off attackers by displaying their blue tongues, and the frill-necked lizard will display its brightly colored frill. These same displays are used in territorial disputes and during courtship. If danger arises so <b>suddenly</b> <b>that</b> flight is useless, crocodiles, turtles, some lizards, and some snakes hiss loudly when confronted by an enemy. Rattlesnakes rapidly vibrate {{the tip of the}} tail, which is composed of a series of nested, hollow beads to ward of approaching danger.|$|E
25|$|On 24 November, Kellermann massed 16,000 French {{troops on}} the Duero near Valdestillas. Badly outnumbered, the French {{prepared}} to defend themselves. But on this day the Army of the Left received news of the Ocaña disaster. Understanding that this dire event meant that the French could spare plenty of soldiers to track down his army, Del Parque bolted to the south, intending to shelter {{in the mountains of}} central Spain. On 25 November, Del Parque slipped away so <b>suddenly</b> <b>that</b> Kellermann did not even begin his pursuit until the next day. For two days, the French were unable to catch up with their adversaries. But on the afternoon of 28 November, their light cavalry found the Army of the Left camped at Alba de Tormes.|$|E

500|$|Arthur {{returned}} {{to being a}} lawyer, {{and with the help}} of additional contacts made in the military, he and the firm of Arthur & Gardiner flourished. [...] Even as his professional life improved, however, Arthur and his wife experienced a personal tragedy as their only child, William, died <b>suddenly</b> <b>that</b> year at the age of three. [...] The couple took their son's death hard, and when they had another son, Chester Alan Jr., in 1864, they lavished attention on him. [...] They also had a daughter, Ellen, in 1871. Both children survived to adulthood.|$|E
500|$|The {{reaction}} to the game's cancellation was overwhelmingly negative. Commentators in the industry media felt that the decision was representative of the diminishing relevance of adventure games, with many concluding that LucasArts was moving to maintain its position with low risk Star Wars-themed titles instead of the adventure games that had brought them success in earlier years. Freelance Polices cancellation is often cited as {{the culmination of the}} adventure genre's decline. The decision came so <b>suddenly</b> <b>that</b> some magazines accidentally published favorable previews of the game after LucasArts' announcement. A fan web site named [...] "Save Sam and Max" [...] presented a petition of 32,000 signatures to LucasArts conveying the fans' disappointment. Steve Purcell, the creator of the Sam & Max franchise, stated that he was disappointed by LucasArts' decision: ...|$|E

500|$|When he escapes the {{building}} and enters the mall, Hall feels he is disturbed by advertisements calling to him by name {{not only because they}} will give away his presence, but also because they remind him of his lost place in society, and he begins [...] "to see through the false consciousness his (illusory) previous position as fixed subject had allowed him." [...] Spielberg said that Anderton is being punished for his previous callous unconcern for anything but the effectiveness of the PreCrime program. [...] "He's dirtied {{by the fact that he}} doesn't spend much time thinking about the moral consequences. It's just like a sporting event almost — and then <b>suddenly</b> <b>that</b> whole sporting event makes him the soccer ball." [...] His doubts about his own future lead him to examine his previous life to better understand himself according to Hall. He runs through his role in the PreCrime system, and his son's disappearance [...] "to reconstruct his past." [...] After Leo Crow in fact kills himself, Anderton becomes healed, and later has [...] "recreated himself as the subject he was previously through the knowledge that he is not a killer." [...] Although he has satisfactorily repaired his self-image, Anderton is not the same person, as he not longer believes in the PreCrime system. Hall says that Burgess' final dilemma; namely, his desire to keep PreCrime running, his inability to bring himself to kill Anderton, and his desire to live, drives him to see his only suitable action to be suicide. [...] "Burgess has been left truly alone by events," [...] argues Hall. [...] "His wife fainted when she saw the images of the murder and Anderton has been the cause of this rupture." ...|$|E
500|$|On 13 August, after {{sighting}} a small patrol boat, three abandoned merchant {{ships were}} passed, {{some of them}} close by with boats showing flares. The convoy was sighted early in the morning, with the destroyer leading the tanker in astern of the line. The destroyer then informed the Convoy Commander of the tanker's condition. Torpedo planes flew in to distract attention from Junkers 88s which were coming in from a height. The convoy had detected these by R.D.F but could not sight them and the escorts were slow in opening fire on them. [...] was hit, probably by {{about three or four}} bombs, and blew up with a tremendous explosion leaving [...] "a great pylon of flame on the sea". Ashanti signalled Ledbury to pick up survivors. The destroyer went to the scene, but it was originally thought impossible that anyone could survive such a terrific explosion and mass of flames, but on approaching, men were seen in the water. The destroyer entered the inferno, and after manoeuvring around the debris field the destroyer picked up forty-four survivors, and one body was buried that evening with military honours. Some time later it was discovered that Ledbury had on board survivors from both Waimarama and Melbourne Star. This happened because when Waimarama blew up it happened so <b>suddenly</b> <b>that</b> Melbourne Star passed right through the flames. Those aft on board Melbourne Star thought that their own ship had gone up and had jumped over the side. By half past-nine Ledbury had completed the recovery of survivors. By this time the Commander estimated that the destroyer was about thirty miles astern of the convoy, which meant that they had to speed up in order to reach the ships. Captain Hill then sent a message to Admiral Burrough, 'Interrogative STOP rejoin or go home'. When the signal rating brought in Burrough's reply it became apparent that the signal groups had been received corruptly, since the admiral was apparently ordering Ledbury to [...] "proceed to the Orkney and Shetland Islands". After considering the signal, Captain Hill assumed that it plainly intended the destroyer to return to Gibraltar, however that he might be forgiven for not interpreting it correctly, and so Ledbury ignored the signal and set course for Ohio.|$|E
2500|$|The {{title of}} the film was decided late in the script's development. O'Bannon had quickly dropped the film's {{original}} title, Star Beast, but {{could not think of}} a name to replace it. [...] "I was running through titles, and they all stank", O'Bannon said in an interview, [...] "when <b>suddenly,</b> <b>that</b> word alien just came out of the typewriter at me. Alien. It's a noun and it's an adjective." [...] The word alien subsequently became the {{title of the}} film and, by extension, the name of the creature itself.|$|E

He took her on trips to New York to see Broadway shows. [...] As Radner wrote in It's Always Something, when she was 12, her father developed a brain tumor, and the symptoms began so <b>suddenly</b> <b>that</b> he told people his eyeglasses were too tight. Within days, he was bedridden and unable to communicate, and remained in that condition until his death two years later.|$|E

[...] Only {{a few of the}} men could swim. The boat came to pieces, with the hull sinking almost immediately and the superstructure floating free. [...] All the members of the crew were able to survive, by hanging on to the floating wreckage, although some were in the water for more than an hour.|$|E

2500|$|Lind died at her {{residence}} at Brookside, Salthill, Slough, {{at the age}} of 61, having become ill rather <b>suddenly</b> <b>that</b> year. [...] Her obituary from The Times said, [...] "She was very pretty; she was very graceful; there was something appealing about her which might almost be called childish. She had a queer and very attractive little croak in her voice, and an elementary, little-girlish way of saying things which made them peculiarly engaging, and caused her saying of them to stick in the memory with a permanence which their wit or point might by no means justify. Add to this the enchanting lissomeness and beauty of all such movements as she was mistress of, and a stage personality (as we call it) which was like no one else's, and there is more than justification for the glow which the remembrance of her performances kindles." [...] Lind's funeral took place at St. Mary's Church, Slough, on Friday, 31 August 1923, and she was buried in Windsor Cemetery.|$|E
2500|$|After {{watching}} Michigan's 12–11 {{victory over}} Chicago in 1898, Louis Elbel, {{who was at}} the time a student in the University of Michigan School of Music, was inspired to write [...] "The Victors," [...] which was later adopted as Michigan's fight song. [...] He reportedly began composing the song at his sister's house in the Englewood section of Chicago and continued the effort on the return train ride from Chicago to Ann Arbor. [...] Elbel's lyric, [...] "Champions of the West," [...] refers to Michigan's having won the Western Conference championship {{for the first time in}} the school's history. [...] Elbel later recalled:"We were crazed with joy. [...] We paraded in the dark. We yelled and followed our U-M Band, singing to the tune of 'Hot Time in the Old Town.' It struck me quite <b>suddenly</b> <b>that</b> such an epic should be dignified by something more elevating, for this was not ordinary victory. [...] My spirits were so uplifted that I was clear off the earth, and that is when 'The Victors' was inspired. I put in a lot of 'hails' and I knew the fellows would get them in with the proper emphasis. Through them, the title suggested itself, and I dedicated it to the Michigan team of 1898." ...|$|E
2500|$|I had {{a terrific}} {{friendship}} with Sheila Florance. In fact she acted in {{my very first}} film, and we always used to joke that I would make her a star. When I heard <b>suddenly</b> <b>that</b> she was dying of cancer I visited her immediately. There was no sentimentality or anything on her part—she was an incredible woman—but she said jokingly, 'There is still time to turn me into a star, but let's be quick.' I went home and spent three days and three nights writing the script and then with Barry Dickins and Sheila we did another draft. She was given eight weeks to live and so we made A Woman's Tale with this hanging over us. This motivated us, of course, but Sheila had a degree of greatness about her. She was a very powerful woman. It was an amazing challenge {{to make a film}} about life, in the face of death. To get the money of course was impossible and I had to pawn everything I had. People have asked me how we did it but to some extent we were idiotically courageous in taking this risk. Sheila and I joked all the time. I would say to Sheila, [...] "Please don't die on me or you'll kill me". She would reply, [...] "Don't worry I'll be a good girl." ...|$|E

2500|$|Like Euripides, both Aeschylus and Sophocles created comic effects {{contrasting}} {{the heroic}} with the mundane, but they employed minor supporting characters for that purpose, whereas the younger poet was more insistent, using major characters as well. His comic touches {{can be thought}} to intensify the overall tragic effect, and his realism, which often threatens to make his heroes look ridiculous, marks a world of debased heroism: [...] "The loss of intellectual and moral substance becomes a central tragic statement". Psychological reversals are common and sometimes happen so <b>suddenly</b> <b>that</b> inconsistency in characterization is an issue for many critics, such as Aristotle, who cited Iphigenia in Aulis as an example (Poetics 1454a32). For others, psychological inconsistency is not a stumbling block to good drama: [...] "Euripides is {{in pursuit of a}} larger insight: he aims to set forth the two modes, emotional and rational, with which human beings confront their own mortality." [...] Some however consider unpredictable behaviour to be realistic in tragedy: [...] "everywhere in Euripides a preoccupation with individual psychology and its irrational aspects is evident....In his hands tragedy for the first time probed the inner recesses of the human soul and let passions spin the plot." [...] The tension between reason and passion is symbolized by his character's relationship with the gods, as in Hecuba's prayer, answered not by Zeus, nor by the Law of Reason, but by brutal Menelaus as if speaking on behalf of the old gods, and most famously in Bacchae, where the god Dionysus savages his own converts. And yet when the gods appear deus ex machina, as they do in eight of the extant plays, they appear [...] "lifeless and mechanical". Sometimes condemned by critics as an unimaginative way to end a story, the spectacle of a [...] "god" [...] making a judgement or announcement from a theatrical crane might actually have been intended to provoke scepticism about the religious and heroic dimension of his plays. Similarly his plays often begin in a banal manner that undermines theatrical illusion. Unlike Sophocles, who established the setting and background of his plays in the introductory dialogue, Euripides used a monologue in which a divinity or human character directly and simply tells the audience all it needs to know {{in order to understand the}} subsequent action.|$|E
