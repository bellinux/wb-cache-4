40|$|As {{transistor}} size is scaled down, {{the performance}} is degraded and many problems, so called shortchannel effects, arise. To address this problem, a vertical transistor structure such as vertical nanowire is suggested. In a vertical nanowire field-effect-transistor, the Ohmic contact {{at the top}} of the nanowire not only covers the top surface, but also wraps around the <b>sidewall.</b> Because the <b>sidewall</b> is considered to be different from the top surface, it is necessary to study the <b>sidewall</b> Ohmic contact properties such as the contact resistivity. In this thesis, to explore <b>sidewall</b> contact resistivity, a theoretical model for <b>sidewall</b> contacts is developed. For the suggested test structure, the fin <b>sidewall</b> contact (FSWC) structure, the <b>sidewall</b> contact is modeled with a transmission line model (TLM), and by using TLM, the <b>sidewall</b> contact resistance is derived. Also, an extraction method of the <b>sidewall</b> contact resistivity from the total resistance measured in FSWC structure is developed. Next, process steps to fabricate FSWC structure are developed. FSWC structure is made for Mo/n+-InGaAs contacts. The key step is that the fin etch mask on top of InGaAs is not removed and the metal (Mo) is sputtered so that InGaAs is contacted by the Mo only through the <b>sidewall.</b> Therefore, only a <b>sidewall</b> contact is made without a top contact. Also, to investigate the way to improve the <b>sidewall</b> contact resistivity, the effect of digital etch and annealing on the <b>sidewall</b> contact resistivity is explored. With the measured total resistance in FSWC structure and the extraction method for <b>sidewall</b> contact resistivity, <b>sidewall</b> contact resistivity for each split of digital etch and annealing are extracted. As a summary of the effect of digital etch and annealing, two cycles of digital etch or sequential annealing up to 400 °C improves the <b>sidewall</b> contact resistivity with little sacrifice in semiconductor resistivity. The best result of <b>sidewall</b> contact resistivity is 3. 7 ± 0. 01 [Omega] x [mu]m 2 at 400 °C annealing, which is about 1. 9 times improvement over the non-annealed value, 6. 9 ± 0. 05 [Omega] x [mu]m 2 but still about 5. 4 times larger than the reported top contact resistivity of 0. 69 ± 0. 3 [Omega] x [mu]m 2. by Dongsung ChoiThesis: S.

25|$|The {{surgical}} {{management of}} nasal defects and deformities divides the nose into six (6) anatomic subunits: (i) the dorsum, (ii) the <b>sidewalls</b> (paired), (iii) the hemilobules (paired), (iv) the soft triangles (paired), (v) the alae (paired), and (vi) the columella. Surgical correction and reconstruction comprehend the entire anatomic subunit {{affected by the}} defect (wound) or deformity, thus, the entire subunit is corrected, especially when the resection (cutting) of the defect encompasses more than 50 per cent of the subunit. Aesthetically, the nose—from the nasion (the midpoint of the nasofrontal junction) to the columella-labial junction—ideally occupies one-third of the vertical dimension of the person’s face; and, from ala to ala, it ideally should occupy one-fifth of the horizontal dimension of the person's face.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} the temperature boundary conditions at the <b>sidewall</b> on the heat transport in Rayleigh-Bénard (RB) convection using direct numerical simulations. For relatively low Rayleigh numbers Ra the heat transport is higher when the <b>sidewall</b> is isothermal, kept at a temperature T_c+Δ/ 2 (where Δ is the temperature difference between the horizontal plates and T_c the temperature of the cold plate), than when the <b>sidewall</b> is adiabatic. The reason is that in the former case part of the heat current avoids the thermal resistance of the fluid layer by escaping through the <b>sidewall</b> that acts as a short-circuit. For higher Ra the bulk becomes more isothermal and this reduces the heat current through the <b>sidewall.</b> Therefore the heat flux in a cell with an isothermal <b>sidewall</b> converges to the value obtained with an adiabatic <b>sidewall</b> for high enough Ra (≃ 10 ^ 10). However, when the <b>sidewall</b> temperature deviates from T_c+Δ/ 2 the heat transport at the bottom and top plates is different from the value obtained using an adiabatic <b>sidewall.</b> In this case the difference does not decrease with increasing Ra thus indicating that the ambient temperature of the experimental apparatus can influence the heat transfer. A similar behavior is observed when only a very small <b>sidewall</b> region close to the horizontal plates is kept isothermal, {{while the rest of the}} <b>sidewall</b> is adiabatic. The reason is that in the region closest to the horizontal plates the temperature difference between the fluid and the <b>sidewall</b> is highest. This suggests that one should be careful with the placement of thermal shields outside the fluid sample to minimize spurious heat currents. Comment: 27 pages, 16 figure...|$|R

40|$|Microfluidic {{channels}} {{enable the}} control of cell positioning and the capturing of cells for high-throughput screening and other cellular applications. In this paper, a simple microfluidic platform is proposed for capturing small volumes of cells using <b>sidewall</b> microgrooves. The cell docking patterns in the channels containing <b>sidewall</b> microgroove are also studied. Both numerical and experi‐ mental investigations are performed within channels containing <b>sidewall</b> microgrooves of three different widths (i. e., 50, 100 and 200 μm). It is observed that channels containing <b>sidewall</b> microgrooves {{play an important role}} in regulating cell positioning and patterning. The obtained results revealed that 10 to 14 cells were positioned inside the <b>sidewall</b> channels of 200 μm width, two to five cells were positioned within the channels of 100 μm width, and one to two individual cells were docked within the <b>sidewall</b> channel of 50 μm width. Particle modelling shows the prediction of cell positioning within <b>sidewall</b> micro‐ grooves. The positions of cells docked within microgroove- containing channels were also quantified. Furthermore, the shear stress variation and cell positioning in the <b>sidewall</b> microgrooves were correlated. Therefore, these <b>sidewall</b> microgroove-containing channels could be potentially useful for regulating cell positioning and patterning on two-dimensional surfaces, three-dimensional microenvir‐ onments and high-throughput screening. Cell patterning and positioning are of great importance in many biological applications, such as drug screening and cell-based biosensing...|$|R

Each arch could accommodate anything from 60 to 150 or so persons.

Subways were actual thoroughfares also in the shape of arches, normally allowing passage underneath railway lines.|$|E

25|$|Similarities {{between the}} English and New England barn are that {{buildings}} {{were used for}} multiple purposes: the cows were in tie-ups {{on one side of}} the main floor, typically a narrower space on the warmer side of the building, and hay storage and a stable were in the other side, typically the colder side. Both types of barns were sometimes built with big doors on both ends of the drive floor so a wagon team could drive through and generally called a drive through barn. Occasionally the back door was small and only used for ventilation or winnowing. There were likely loose poles called a scaffold on the beams above the drive floor and loft floors above the tie-ups. There may be a transom window above the barn doors and windows were used as needed in some of the walls, but more windows are likely to be found in the New England barn.
