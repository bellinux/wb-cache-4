5|$|The DB9's {{interior}} {{is made with}} leather and walnut wood. In newer editions, the leather is additionally given hand-stitched accents and joins. On the dashboard, satnav and Bluetooth are standard in later models (options on earlier models). Later models also offered a Dolby Prologic sound <b>system</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> connected to satellite radio, a six-CD changer, an iPod connector, a USB connector, or an auxiliary input jack.

5|$|Each {{engine is}} {{supplied}} by a separate 1,074 litre (276 US Gallon, 230 Imperial Gallon) fuel tank using dual booster pumps. Optional {{fourth and fifth}} tanks {{can be added to}} act as a reservoir supply, topping up the main tanks during flight, increasing range or endurance. The AW101 can also be outfitted with a probe for aerial refuelling. Self-sealing fuel tanks are an optional item to be selected by the customer. An inlet particle separator <b>system</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> installed, protecting the engine when operating in sandy environments.|$|E
5|$|Red maple is a {{good choice}} of a tree for urban areas when there is ample room for its root system. Forming an {{association}} with Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi can help A. rubrum grow along city streets. It is more tolerant of pollution and road salt than Sugar Maples, although the tree's fall foliage is not as vibrant in this environment. Like several other maples, its low root <b>system</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> invasive and it makes a poor choice for plantings near paving. It attracts squirrels, who eat its buds in the early spring, although squirrels prefer the larger buds of the silver maple.|$|E
50|$|Rewriting <b>systems</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> seen as {{programs}} that infer end-effects {{from a list}} of cause-effect relationships. In this way, rewriting <b>systems</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> considered to be automated causality provers.|$|R

50|$|Embedded {{systems are}} used in transportation, fire safety, safety and security, medical {{applications}} and life critical systems, as these <b>systems</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> isolated from hacking and thus, be more reliable. For fire safety, the <b>systems</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> designed to have greater ability to handle higher temperatures and continue to operate. In dealing with security, the embedded <b>systems</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> self-sufficient {{and be able to}} deal with cut electrical and communication systems.|$|R
5|$|The {{combination}} of the distance and proper motion of this <b>system</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used to compute the transverse velocity of IK Pegasi as 16.9 km/s. The third component, the heliocentric radial velocity, can be measured by the average red-shift (or blue-shift) of the stellar spectrum. The General Catalogue of Stellar Radial Velocities lists a radial velocity of -11.4 km/s for this system. The {{combination of}} these two motions gives a space velocity of 20.4 km/s relative to the Sun.|$|E
5|$|The {{distance}} to the IK Pegasi <b>system</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> measured directly by observing the tiny parallax shifts of this system (against the more distant stellar background) as the Earth orbits around the Sun. This shift was measured to high precision by the Hipparcos spacecraft, yielding a distance estimate of 150 light years (with an accuracy of Â±5 light years). The same spacecraft also measured the proper motion of this system. This is the small angular motion of IK Pegasi across the sky because of its motion through space.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the English Poor Law <b>system</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> traced back to late medieval {{statutes}} dealing with beggars and vagrancy {{but it was only}} during the Tudor period that the Poor Law system became codified. Monasteries, the primary source of poor relief, were dissolved by the Tudors Reformation causing poor relief to move from a largely voluntary basis to a compulsory tax that was collected at a parish level. Early legislation was concerned with vagrants and making the able-bodied work, especially while labour was in short supply following the Black Death.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the <b>system</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> traced to a {{tropical}} wave that moved across the eastern Caribbean {{in the last week}} of May.

5|$|The {{vascular}} (blood) <b>system</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{impacted by}} solid tumors. Between 15 and 25 percent of {{deep vein thrombosis}} is caused by cancer (often by a tumor compressing a vein), {{and it may be}} the first hint that cancer is present. It causes swelling and pain in the legs, especially the calf, and (rarely) in the arms. The superior vena cava (a large vein carrying circulating, de-oxygenated blood into the heart) may be compressed by a tumor, causing superior vena cava syndrome, which can cause chest wall pain among other symptoms.|$|E
5|$|In {{designing}} the 777 {{as its first}} fly-by-wire commercial aircraft, Boeing decided to retain conventional control yokes rather than change to sidestick controllers as used in many fly-by-wire fighter aircraft and in many Airbus airliners. Along with traditional yoke and rudder controls, the cockpit features a simplified layout that retains similarities to previous Boeing models. The fly-by-wire system also incorporates flight envelope protection, a system that guides pilot inputs within a computer-calculated framework of operating parameters, acting to prevent stalls, overspeeds, and excessively stressful maneuvers. This <b>system</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> overridden by the pilot if deemed necessary. The fly-by-wire system is supplemented by mechanical backup.|$|E

5|$|In {{this kind}} of system, the {{developers}} set {{the properties of the}} camera, such as its position, orientation or field of view, during the game creation. The camera views will not change dynamically, so the same place will always be shown under the same set of views. An early example of {{this kind of}} camera <b>system</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> seen in Alone in the Dark. While the characters are in 3D, the background on which they evolve has been pre-rendered. The early Resident Evil games are notable examples of games that use fixed cameras. The God of War series of video games is also known for this technique.|$|E
5|$|Kepler's laws of {{planetary}} motion describe {{the orbits of}} objects about the Sun. Following Kepler's laws, each object travels along an ellipse with the Sun at one focus. Objects closer to the Sun (with smaller semi-major axes) travel more quickly {{because they are more}} affected by the Sun's gravity. On an elliptical orbit, a body's distance from the Sun varies over the course of its year. A body's closest approach to the Sun is called its perihelion, whereas its most distant point from the Sun is called its aphelion. The orbits of the planets are nearly circular, but many comets, asteroids, and Kuiper belt objects follow highly elliptical orbits. The positions of the bodies in the Solar <b>System</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> predicted using numerical models.|$|E
5|$|Space itself {{possesses}} symmetry. It {{looks the}} same no matter how one rotates it, and the resulting rotational symmetry {{is referred to as}} isotropy of space. In the present case it is common to use passive rotations, meaning that the observer rotates themself. Mathematically, the active operation of a rotation is performed by multiplying position vectors by a rotation matrix. A passive rotation is accomplished by rotating only the basis vectors of the coordinate system. (The coordinate <b>system</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> thought of as being fixed in the rotated observer. The observer is physically rotated.) In this way, every point in space obtains new coordinates as if it was somehow physically rigidly rotated.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the <b>system</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> traced to a {{tropical}} depression roughly midway between the Lesser Antilles and {{the west coast of}} Africa at 1800 UTC on September 7. Though initially believed to have developed on September 11, the disturbance was found to have formed earlier in post-season reanalysis, based on data from the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set. In its early developmental stages, the disturbance remained a tropical depression with little change in intensity. At 0600UTC on September10, it intensified into a tropical storm while still east of the Lesser Antilles. Closer to the islands, ships reported a quickly intensifying tropical cyclone with low barometric pressures, strong winds and heavy thunderstorms, although most of the activity occurred to the east of its center.|$|E
