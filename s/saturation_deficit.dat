Saturated soils were found in localities with specific land use (grassland, meadows) or farming systems (livestock production with high manure production). Smaller deficits occurred at higher altitudes, probably due to the combined effect of cooler temperature and the presence of meadows. Some very sandy soils appeared to be almost saturated, largely due to their very small fine fraction.

Worldwide, it has been implicated in successful biocontrol {{in only a few}} widely separated localities. C perminutus contributes little to control P. citri in field situations in south-east Queensland, Australia, but invades insectary cultures and reduces mealybug populations considerably under these controlled conditions. This discrepancy between poor field performance and good performance under controlled conditions was investigated to establish whether climatic factors inhibit the field performance of this species in the biological control of P. citri. Subsequent laboratory examination of the influence of varied humidities and temperatures on the activity levels and survival of C perminutus revealed a low tolerance for high <b>saturation</b> <b>deficits</b> (i. e., low % RH at high T degreesC) with reduced reproductive output. The influence of different food sources on adult survival and reproduction was also quantified, to establish if the adverse effects of climate could be overcome by supplementing adult diet. Neither honeydew from their mealybug hosts nor nectar from Alphitonia flowers significantly enhanced parasitoid survival. A subsequent test of five nectar species revealed a significant difference in their influence on C. perminutus survival and reproduction, with only Alpinia zerumbet proving to be as suitable as honey. The floral species that proved suitable in the laboratory need to be checked for their attractiveness to C perminutus in the field and for their ability to enhance the survival and reproductive output of parasitoids. This information suggests that the prevailing dry conditions in south-east Queensland citrus-growing areas apparently impede successful biological control of P. citri by C perminutus, but possibilities are available for habitat manipulation (by providing suitable nectar sources for adult parasitoids) to conserve and enhance C perminutus activity in the field.

40|$|Summary We modeled {{the effects}} of climate change and two forest {{management}} scenarios on wood production and forest carbon balance in French forests using process-based models of forest growth. We combined data from the national forest in-ventory and soil network survey, which were aggregated over a 50 × 50 -km grid, i. e., the spatial resolution of the climate sce-nario data. We predicted and analyzed the climate impact on potential forest production over the period 1960 – 2100. All models predicted a slight increase in potential forest yield until 2030 – 2050, followed by a plateau or a decline around 2070 – 2100, with overall, a greater increase in yield in northern France than in the south. Gross and net primary productivities were more negatively affected by soil water and atmospheric water vapor <b>saturation</b> <b>deficits</b> in western France because of a more pro-nounced shift in seasonal rainfall from summer to winter. The rotation-averaged values of carbon flux and production for different forest management options were estimated during four years (1980, 2015, 2045 and 2080). Predictions were made using a two-dimensional matrix covering the range of lo-cal soil and climate conditions. The changes in ecosystem fluxes and forest production were explained by the counterbal-ancing effect of rising CO 2 concentration and increasing water deficit. The effect of climate change decreased with rotation length from short rotations with high production rates and low standing biomasses to long rotations with low productivities and greater standing biomasses. Climate effects on productiv-ity, both negative and positive, were greatest on high fertility sites. Forest productivity in northern France was enhanced by climate change, increasingly from west to east, whereas in the southwestern Atlantic region, productivity was reduced by cli-mate change to an increasing degree from west to east...|$|R

In an experimental arena with zones at different climatic conditions, starved R. prolixus nymphs prefer a cooler and more humid zone, stopping there more often and for longer periods. This is probably a behavioural adaptation to limit water loss and reduce metabolic rate. In the Venezuelan State of Portuguesa, temperature and humidity were monitored in three kinds of potential refugia during the dry season: (i) in a palm roof; (ii) in a crack of the wall of a house; and (iii) in a palm tree crown. Fluctuations in temperature and <b>saturation</b> <b>deficit</b> are not very different inside and outside the palm roof except during a few hours of the day when the sun is at its zenith. In the crack of the wall, the diurnal temperature range is reduced to 6. 5 C compared with 12. 4 C outside, and the <b>saturation</b> <b>deficit</b> varies by only 7. 6 hPa compared with 28. 6 hPa outside. In the palm tree crown, the daily temperature range is only 4. 2 C compared with 13. 8 C outside, and the <b>saturation</b> <b>deficit</b> is permanently < 5 hPa. The micro...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of an auxanometer capable of detecting 0. 67 um increments in plant elongation and its application {{to the study of}} hypocotyl elongation in intact Lupinus angustifolius seedlings is described. A displacement transducer, in conjunction with a carrier wave oscillator-demodulator and a digital voltmeter, was utilised to detect changes in length of the elongating hypocotyls of four day old lupin seedlings. The design of a root bathing solution chamber and environmental control chamber is outlined. With the aid of these two chambers the following environmental parameters could be varied independently:- temperature, water potential and aeration of the root bathing solution; temperature, relative humidity, and gaseous composition of the environment; composition and intensity of light within the environmental chamber. Problems encountered in effecting rapid changes of these parameters are discussed. The viability of the auxanometer as an effective tool for plant growth research was tested by its application to the study of growth rates under a variety of environmental changes. Short term growth responses of lupin hypocotyls to changes in relative humidity, root temperature, and osmotic potential of the root bathing solution, plus exposure to anaerobic nitrogen and carbon dioxide atmospheres, have yielded the following results:- 1. Variations in <b>saturation</b> <b>deficits</b> of between 2. 9 and 16. 2 mbar altered growth rates only marginally. 2. Fluctuations in root temperatures between 23 and 43 °C scarcely effect hypocotyl growth rates. 3. Growth responses to changes in osmotic potential of the root bathing solution are similar to those described by Acevedo et al (1971) with intact maize leaves. 4. Periods of anaerobic nitrogen conditions yielded results comparative with those of Gillbank et al (1972), Who studied the effects of cyanide on growth of wheat coleoptile segments, except for nitrogen treatments of more than 30 minutes in duration. 5. Exposure of seedlings to an anaerobic carbon dioxide atmosphere stimulates hypocotyl growth rates by up to eight times, the results indicating that CO 2 stimulates the utilisation of a growth precursor within the cell whilst simultaneously inhibiting its synthesis. The results illustrate both the versatility and the potential of the described auxanometer in the description of plant growth responses to environmental changes, consequently aiding in the identification of the causal mechanisms of plant growth processes...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe compare {{assimilation}} and respiration rates, and water use strategies in four divergent ecosystems located in cold-continental central Siberia and in semi-arid southern Africa. These seemingly unrelated systems {{have in common}} a harsh and highly seasonal environment with a very sharp transition between the dormant and the active season, and with vegetation facing dry air and soil conditions for {{at least part of}} the year. Moreover, the northern high latitudes and the semi-arid tropics will likely experience changes in key environmental parameters (e. g., air temperature and precipitation) in the future; indeed, in some regions marked climate trends have already been observed over the last decade or so. The magnitude of instantaneous or daily {{assimilation and}} respiration rates, derived from one to two years of eddy covariance measurements in each of the four ecosystems, was not related to the growth environment. For instance, respiration rates were clearly highest in the two deciduous systems included in the analysis (a Mopane woodland in northern Botswana and a Downy birch forest in Siberia; > 300 mmol m ? 2 d ? 1), while assimilation rates in the Mopane woodland were relatively similar to a Siberian Scots pine canopy for a large part of the active season (ca. 420 mmol m ? 2 d ? 1). Acknowledging the limited number of ecosystems compared here, these data nevertheless suggest that factors like vegetation type, canopy phenology or ecosystem age can override larger-scale climate differences in terms of their effects on carbon assimilation and respiration rates. By far the highest rates of assimilation were observed in Downy birch, an early successional species. These were achieved at a rather conservative water use, as indicated by relatively low levels of ?, the marginal water cost of plant carbon gain. Surprisingly, the Mopane woodland growing in the semi-arid environment had significantly higher values of ?. However, its water use strategy included a very plastic response to intermittently dry periods, and values of ? were much more conservative overall during a rainy season with low precipitation and high air <b>saturation</b> <b>deficits.</b> Our comparison demonstrates that forest ecosystems can respond very dynamically in terms of water use strategy, both on interannual and much shorter time scales. It remains to be evaluated whether and in which ecosystems this plasticity is mainly due to a short-term stomatal response, or goes hand in hand with changes in canopy photosynthetic capacity...|$|R
