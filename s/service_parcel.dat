40|$|Solar {{photovoltaic}} (PV) {{energy conversion}} offers a sustainable method of producing electricity {{to maintain and}} improve {{the standard of living}} within cities. Planning for large-scale adoption of PV in cities, however, provides a challenge to urban planners because of the distributed nature of PV. This paper develops a new methodology to determine a city's PV potential by analysis of solar PV generation potential by distribution feeder given the solar exposure and orientation of rooftops serviced by a specific feeder within the city. The methodology is applied to an example feeder, and then can be scaled to apply to the network of any city. The method comprises the following steps: (i) rooftop extraction from aerial photos; (ii) <b>service</b> <b>parcel</b> and territory matching based on geographical information system (GIS) data; (iii) simulation of the solar exposure of the customers connected to distribution feeders based on local meteorological conditions and the general roof orientation of the customers serviced by the feeder; and (iv) sensitivity analyses of electricity yield as a function of PV module efficiency. Experience from the case study such as trade-offs between time consumption and data quality is discussed to highlight a need for connectivity between demographic information, electrical engineering schematics and GIS. Finally conclusions are developed to provide final methodology with the most and useful information from the highest constrained sources and can be adapted anywhere in the world...|$|E
40|$|International audienceToday {{road haulage}} is France's most {{important}} transport mode, proving {{its ability to}} meet shippers' demands. Road haulage has several success factors, {{some of which are}} technical (for example, the speed and density of the motorway and road network). Others are economic (the low price or road transport). Last but not least, relationships among road hauliers {{play a major role in}} competitiveness. Among other factors, the opportunity that large companies have to subcontract with very small ones, with very low fixed costs and great flexibility, is often quoted as a major advantage. The ECHO survey, conducted in France in 2004, provides information on 10 000 shipments made by 3000 shippers. For each shipment, the survey gives details about the shipper, the shipment itself, and each company providing transport or logistics services for that shipment. The survey allows us to analyze subcontracting, by showing us each stage at which a shipment is contracted to the next carrier. This analysis reveals the frequency of subcontracting in France, and gives us the opportunity to study why subcontracts are made. Of course, some of the subcontracts are mainly cost driven. However, others aim at using the specialized skills of a particular haulier (a frequent service to a given destination, for example). Finally, the aim of some subcontracts is to increase transport chain efficiency. The usual transport segments are studied : single parcel delivery <b>service,</b> <b>parcel</b> delivery service, less than truck load, full truck load. The share of shipments and the number of tonnes which fall under the purview of subcontracting are studied. For each transport segment, subcontracting is described in terms of size of companies involved, services provided, and the reason for subcontracting. These results demonstrate the main features of several different types of subcontracting relationships. Beyond the search for low costs, the paper highlights the various forms of partnership between road hauliers...|$|E
