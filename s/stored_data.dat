25|$|The spacecraft's onboard {{computer}} system was contained in an Integrated Electronics Module (IEM), {{a device that}} combined core avionics into a single box. The computer featured two radiation-hardened IBM RAD6000s, a 25megahertz main processor, and a 10MHz fault protection processor. For redundancy, the spacecraft carried a pair of identical IEMs. For data storage, the spacecraft carried two solid-state recorders able to store up to one gigabyte each. The IBM RAD6000 main processor collected, compressed, and <b>stored</b> <b>data</b> from MESSENGERs instruments for later playback to Earth.|$|E

25|$|The {{cathode ray}} tube (CRT) is a vacuum tube that {{contains}} one or more electron guns and a phosphorescent screen, and is used to display images. It modulates, accelerates, and deflects electron beam(s) onto the screen to create the images. The images may represent electrical waveforms (oscilloscope), pictures (television, computer monitor), radar targets, or others. CRTs have also been used as memory devices, {{in which case the}} visible light emitted from the fluorescent material (if any) is not intended to have significant meaning to a visual observer (though the visible pattern on the tube face may cryptically represent the <b>stored</b> <b>data).</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{hard disk}} drive (HDD), hard disk, hard drive or fixed disk is a data storage device that uses {{magnetic}} storage to store and retrieve digital information using one or more rigid rapidly rotating disks (platters) coated with magnetic material. The platters are paired with magnetic heads, usually arranged on a moving actuator arm, which read and write data to the platter surfaces. Data is accessed in a random-access manner, meaning that individual blocks of data can be stored or retrieved in any order and not only sequentially. HDDs are a type of non-volatile storage, retaining <b>stored</b> <b>data</b> even when powered off.|$|E
500|$|In dynamic RAM (DRAM), each bit of <b>stored</b> <b>data</b> {{occupies}} a separate memory cell that is electrically implemented with one capacitor and one transistor. [...] The charge state of a capacitor (charged or discharged) is what determines whether a DRAM cell stores [...] "1" [...] or [...] "0" [...] as a binary value. [...] Huge numbers of DRAM memory cells are packed into integrated circuits, together with some additional logic that organizes the cells {{for the purposes}} of reading, writing and refreshing the data.|$|E
30|$|A Storage Area Network (SAN) is a {{dedicated}} device that provides network access to consolidated, block level storage. SAN architectures are alternative to <b>storing</b> <b>data</b> on disks attached to servers or <b>storing</b> <b>data</b> on Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices connected through general purpose networks - which are using file-based protocols.|$|R

500|$|As {{a result}} of storing data bits using {{capacitors}} that have a natural discharge rate, DRAM memory cells lose their state over time and require periodic rewriting of all memory cells, which is {{a process known as}} refreshing. [...] As another result of the design, DRAM memory is susceptible to random changes in <b>stored</b> <b>data,</b> which are known as soft memory errors and attributed to cosmic rays and other causes. [...] There are different techniques that counteract soft memory errors and improve the reliability of DRAM, of which error-correcting code (ECC) memory and its advanced variants (such as lockstep memory) are most commonly used.|$|E
500|$|What {{would become}} Star Fox Adventures was {{initially}} developed by Rare as Dinosaur Planet, a Nintendo 64 game {{unrelated to the}} Star Fox series. According to lead software engineer Phil Tossell, development of Dinosaur Planet began {{after the release of}} Diddy Kong Racing, with two teams to work on the latter title and Jet Force Gemini {{towards the end of the}} Nintendo 64's lifespan. The game was changed many times during early development before Rare settled on the eventual idea of a open world adventure-game based around two interwoven stories. The plot concerned Sabre (whose role was given to Fox) and Krystal, along with sidekicks Tricky and Kyte (who both appear in the finished game), and Randorn, a wizard who was Sabre's father and Krystal's adoptive father (who was dropped entirely). The game featured elements such as the 'SwapStone', which would let the player switch between Krystal and Sabre. Dinosaur Planet was intended to be Rare's last game for the Nintendo 64 and was adorned with gameplay and cinematics introduced by [...] Dinosaur Planet initially utilised the Nintendo 64's Expansion Pak and was housed in a 512-megabit (64 megabyte) cartridge, which would have placed it among the largest Nintendo 64 games by <b>stored</b> <b>data.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Historically, the {{management}} of <b>stored</b> <b>data</b> has involved two aspects — the physical management of block devices [...] such as hard drives and SD cards, and devices such as RAID controllers that present a logical single device based upon multiple physical devices (often undertaken by a volume manager, array manager, or suitable device driver), and {{the management}} of files stored as logical units on these logical block devices (a file system).|$|E
2500|$|Through VII, roadway {{markings}} {{and road}} signs could become obsolete. [...] Existing VII applications use sensors within vehicles which can identify markings on the roadway or signing {{along the side}} of the road, automatically adjusting vehicle parameters as necessary. [...] Ultimately, VII aims to treat such signs and markings as little more than <b>stored</b> <b>data</b> within the system. This could be in the form of data acquired via beacons along a roadway or stored at a centralised database and distributed to all VII-equipped vehicles.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the chief}} {{usability}} problems of the floppy disk is its vulnerability; even inside a closed plastic housing, the disk medium is highly sensitive to dust, condensation and temperature extremes. As with all magnetic storage, it is vulnerable to magnetic fields. Blank disks have been distributed with an extensive set of warnings, cautioning the user not to expose it to dangerous conditions. Disks must not be roughly treated or removed from the drive while the magnetic media is still spinning, since doing so is likely to cause damage to the disk, drive head, or <b>stored</b> <b>data.</b> On the other hand, the 3½‑inch floppy has been lauded for its mechanical usability by HCI expert Donald Norman: ...|$|E
2500|$|Typical {{hard disk}} drives attempt to [...] "remap" [...] {{the data in}} a {{physical}} sector that is failing to a spare physical sector provided by the drive's [...] "spare sector pool" [...] (also called [...] "reserve pool"), while relying on the ECC to recover <b>stored</b> <b>data</b> {{while the number of}} errors in a bad sector is still low enough. The S.M.A.R.T (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) feature counts the total number of errors in the entire HDD fixed by ECC (although not on all hard drives as the related S.M.A.R.T attributes [...] "Hardware ECC Recovered" [...] and [...] "Soft ECC Correction" [...] are not consistently supported), and the total number of performed sector remappings, as the occurrence of many such errors may predict an HDD failure.|$|E
2500|$|The problem started {{because on}} both {{mainframe}} computers and later personal computers, storage was expensive, from {{as low as}} $10 per kilobyte, to in many cases as much as or even more than US$100 per kilobyte. It was therefore very important for programmers to reduce usage. Since programs could simply prefix [...] "19" [...] to the year of a date, most programs internally used, or stored on disc or tape, data files where the date format was six digits, in the form MMDDYY, MM as two digits for the month, DD as two digits for the day, and YY as two digits for the year. As space on disc and tape was also expensive, this also saved money by reducing the size of <b>stored</b> <b>data</b> files and data bases.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{possible}} explanation for the phenomenon of déjà vu is the occurrence of [...] "cryptomnesia", which is where information learned is forgotten but nevertheless stored in the brain, and similar occurrences invoke the contained knowledge, leading to a feeling of familiarity because the event or experience being experienced has already been experienced in the past, known as [...] "déjà vu". Some experts suggest that memory is a process of reconstruction, rather than a recall of fixed, established events. This reconstruction comes from stored components, involving elaborations, distortions, and omissions. Each successive recall of an event is merely a recall of the last reconstruction. The proposed sense of recognition (déjà vu) involves achieving a good [...] "match" [...] between the present experience and our <b>stored</b> <b>data.</b> This reconstruction, however, may now differ so much from the original event that we [...] "know" [...] we have never experienced it before, even though it seems similar.|$|E
