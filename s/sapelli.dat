50|$|<b>Sapelli's</b> {{political}} career arguably commands multifaceted {{perceptions of a}} legacy.|$|R
50|$|It {{would be}} fair to state that <b>Sapelli's</b> {{resignation}} is given far more analysis than his actual service as Vice President.|$|R
50|$|To {{put into}} context <b>Sapelli's</b> {{reputation}} within Uruguayan political culture, {{it may be}} noted also that the reputation of a predecessor as Vice President of Uruguay, Alberto Guani, has largely emerged unscathed despite having served in the Administration of President of Uruguay Gabriel Terra, who, as President Bordaberry was later to do, ruled by decree.|$|R

50|$|Some {{observers}} {{would argue}} that <b>Sapelli's</b> action in dissociating himself with Juan María Bordaberry in 1973, under whom he had been serving, demonstrated {{himself to be a}} figure of constitutional principle. Others {{would argue that}} the position of Vice President of Uruguay, and such power as the holder of the office exercises, is mainly significant {{to the extent that the}} holder is prepared to identify himself unreservedly with the current President of Uruguay, and that in any case the office of Vice President of Uruguay originated from the period of the Presidency of Gabriel Terra, 1931-1938, who ruled by decree.|$|R

50|$|Abdala was succeeded 1972 as Vice President of Uruguay by Jorge <b>Sapelli,</b> whose {{differences}} with the Administration in which he served would, unlike Abdala, lead him to repudiate the office of Vice President, and which thus went into abeyance for many years.|$|E

50|$|Only the Valiant or The Charge of the Brave (Spanish:La carga de los valientes) is a 1940 Argentine {{historical}} drama film {{directed by}} Adelqui Migliar and starring Santiago Arrieta, Domingo <b>Sapelli</b> and Anita Jordán.

50|$|It may {{be noted}} also that, unlike some holders of the {{somewhat}} intermittent office of Vice President of Uruguay (e.g., the distinguished Uruguayan diplomat Alberto Guani), <b>Sapelli</b> {{was a relatively}} untried political figure prior to his assumption of the Vice Presidency, and as such was largely dependent upon the patronage of President Juan María Bordaberry, whom he in any case publicly repudiated in 1973.|$|E
5000|$|He was Vice President of Uruguay from 1985 to 1990, in {{the first}} period of {{democratic}} government after the civilian-military administration of 1973-1985, serving under President Julio María Sanguinetti. A notable feature of his appointment to office was that the Vice Presidency had been vacant since the resignation of Vice President Jorge <b>Sapelli</b> in 1973.

50|$|It {{may also}} be {{observed}} that when <b>Sapelli</b> repudiated President Bordaberry in 1973, {{the circumstances of the}} office of Vice President of Uruguay going into abeyance, it was not until 1985 that the office was revived. Thus his legacy is many-faceted, with the (in the past) long ruling Colorado Party (Uruguay) somewhat belatedly holding him to be a figure of principle, while ironically celebrating him as one who caused the office which he held to go into abeyance for over a decade.|$|E
50|$|Savage Pampas (Spanish:Pampa bárbara) is a 1945 Argentine {{historical}} film {{directed by}} Lucas Demare and Hugo Fregonese and starring Francisco Petrone, Luisa Vehil and Domingo <b>Sapelli.</b> The film's sets {{were designed by}} Germán Gelpi.

50|$|Before {{and after}} his period of Presidential office, he was {{identified}} with schemes for agricultural improvement; his Agriculture minister was Benito Medero. In personal terms, one of Bordaberry's actions which proved in hindsight to have been disadvantageous was his appointment of Jorge <b>Sapelli</b> as Vice President of Uruguay, given the latter's resignation and public repudiation of him in 1973. On June 27, 1973; Bordaberry dissolved Congress, suspended the Constitution and gave the military and police the power to take whatever measures it deemed necessary to restore order. For the next three years, he ruled by decree {{with the assistance of}} a National Security Council ("COSENA").|$|E
50|$|Traditional {{methods of}} data {{collection}} for participatory monitoring use paper and pen. This has advantages in terms of low cost of materials and training, simplicity, and reduced potential for technical hitches. However, all data must be transcribed for analysis, which takes time and can be subject to transcription errors. Increasingly, participatory monitoring initiatives incorporate technology, from GPS recorders to georeference the data collected on paper, to drones to survey remote areas, phones to send simple reports via SMS, or smartphones to collect and store data. Various apps exist to create and manage data collection forms on smartphones (e.g. Open Data Kit, <b>Sapelli</b> and others).|$|E
50|$|Approximately {{the lower}} {{two thirds of}} the {{province}} is covered in rain forest, which grows progressively thicker as one travels south. The forests are composed of hardwood evergreens of species such as dibetu, ebony, iroko, mahogany, obeche, and <b>sapelli,</b> some of which grow to heights of 70 metres or more. There are also numerous ferns and orchids. This forest is stratified into several levels. The first is composed of straight, thick-rooted trees averaging about 40-metres tall. After this grow shorter, thinner trees with highly placed clusters of leaves. Sparse grasses and other plants make up the ground layer. In areas closer to settlements and roads, human groups have harvested the larger trees, thus exposing the forest floor to more direct sunlight and allowing thick vegetation to thrive. The upper third of the province (beginning at about the latitude of Bertoua and Batouri) is dominated by humid, wooded savanna. Trees here are sparser, but still may grow to be as tall as 20 metres.|$|E
