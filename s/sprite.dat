5|$|Firebird Suite—1919 Version by Igor Stravinsky. A <b>Sprite</b> is awoken by her companion, an elk, and accidentally wakes the Firebird, a fiery {{spirit of}} {{destruction}} {{in a nearby}} volcano who destroys the forest and seemingly the <b>Sprite.</b> The <b>Sprite</b> survives and the elk encourages her to restore the forest to its normal state. Introduced by Angela Lansbury.|$|E
5|$|The {{moon was}} later {{named after the}} {{character}} Puck who appears in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, a little <b>sprite</b> who travels around the globe at night with the fairies. In Celtic mythology and English folklore, a Puck is a mischievous <b>sprite,</b> imagined as an evil demon by Christians.|$|E
5|$|In King Arthur and King Cornwall, the Green Knight again {{features}} as Bredbeddle, and {{is depicted as}} one of Arthur's knights. He offers to help Arthur fight a mysterious <b>sprite</b> (controlled by the magician, King Cornwall) which has entered his chamber. When physical attacks fail, Bredbeddle uses a sacred text to subdue it. The Green Knight eventually gains so much control over the <b>sprite</b> through this text that he convinces it to take a sword and strike off its master's head.|$|E
50|$|Sedge <b>sprites</b> {{are similar}} to {{sphagnum}} <b>sprites</b> and southern <b>sprites.</b>|$|R

5000|$|<b>Sprites</b> were {{multiplexed}} across vertical raster lines (over 8 <b>sprites,</b> sometimes up to 120 <b>sprites).</b> A common {{perception is}} that no more than 8 <b>sprites</b> could appear at once on the screen, but assigning new Y coordinates once it has started being drawn made it reappear further down the screen.|$|R
5|$|The North American {{release of}} the game as Dragon Warrior II was created by Enix {{themselves}} and published in 1990. Unlike the original Japanese Famicom version, which used passwords for saving, the NES version used an internal battery backup instead to record the player's progress. The storyline introduction in Moonbrooke is presented exclusively in Dragon Warrior II. In the Japanese original, the game starts right with the injured soldier from Moonbrooke entering Midenhall castle, seeking help from its king. The dialogue of the American localization often used (intentionally) archaic English vocabulary, among other differences from the Japanese version. Like Dragon Warrior, the American version of Dragon Warrior II was censored in some aspects; for example, it used a ghost-like <b>sprite</b> instead of the original defeated character's coffin with cross <b>sprite.</b>|$|E
5|$|Artemis Fowl II is the twelve-year-old prodigy, who has {{dedicated}} {{his life to}} criminal activities. He leads the Fowl criminal empire, which has been established by his family for generations. After significant research, Artemis believes that he has confirmed the existence of fairies. He tracks down an alcoholic <b>sprite</b> posing as a healer in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and travels there with his bodyguard Butler to obtain from her The Book of the People—the Fairy holy book that is written in Gnommish.|$|E
5|$|In Shine Runners, {{the player}} must collect Shine Sprites (an object from Super Mario Sunshine). The player can attack other racers {{to take away}} a Shine <b>Sprite</b> from them, and racers with the fewest Shine Sprites are {{eliminated}} from the game over time. In single player, if the human player is eliminated from the round, the game ends {{and the results are}} randomized.|$|E
5000|$|... 32 single-color <b>sprites</b> in defined layers {{allowing}} higher-numbered <b>sprites</b> to transparently flow over lower-numbered <b>sprites.</b> <b>Sprites</b> {{are available}} at 8×8 pixels or 16×16 pixels, with a 'magnify' bit that doubled all sprites' size but not their resolution. A single bit is available in hardware for coincidence (collision detection), and the console supports automatic movement via an interrupt routine in the ROM. There can {{be no more than}} 4 visible <b>sprites</b> per horizontal scanline.|$|R
5000|$|Children create code in objects called <b>sprites</b> - {{which can}} be {{characters}} or things. ScratchJr comes with a library of <b>sprites,</b> and <b>sprites</b> can be edited or new ones created using the [...] "Paint Editor".|$|R
5000|$|Moving <b>sprites,</b> {{with the}} {{competition}} usually {{focused on the}} number of visible <b>sprites</b> per frame.|$|R
5|$|Much {{like its}} predecessor, the game {{received}} generally positive reviews for its gameplay, <b>sprite</b> animations, and character roster. The Sega Saturn version, utilizing the 4MB RAM expansion cartridge, was praised {{for being an}} arcade-perfect conversion. Due to the memory limitations of the PlayStation, tag team battles were, once again, removed from its port, resulting in more mixed critical reception. A sequel, , was released in 1998.|$|E
5|$|On April 18, 2010, {{the episode}} of Pokémon Sunday showed game footage {{of a player}} {{character}} walking around in a 3D environment and a single screenshot depicting a battle between the player's Zoroark and an enemy Zorua. Host Shoko Nakagawa made note of how the player's Zoroark's <b>sprite</b> was a full body <b>sprite</b> as viewed from behind, when in the past all such sprites only showed a smaller portion of the player's Pokémon's body. On May 9, 2010, the episode of Pokémon Sunday revealed silhouettes of the three Pokémon available to choose from {{at the beginning of}} the games, which were later revealed to be the Grass Snake Pokémon Tsutarja, the Fire Pig Pokémon Pokabu, and the Sea Otter Pokémon Mijumaru. Other information revealed is that the game takes place in the Isshu Region which includes the Hiun City metropolis. On May 16, 2010, the episode of Pokémon Sunday showed game battle footage, illustrating the new in-battle animations and dynamic camera positioning; also described were Zoroark's Illusion ability and the special Zoroark acquired by the movie ticket pre-order gift Pokémon.|$|E
5|$|The Voyager 2 probe {{observed}} in 1989 {{a handful of}} geyser-like eruptions of nitrogen gas and entrained dust from {{beneath the surface of}} Triton in plumes up to 8km high. Triton is thus, along with Earth, Io, and Enceladus, one of the few bodies in the Solar System on which active eruptions of some sort have been observed. The best-observed examples are named Hili and Mahilani (after a Zulu water <b>sprite</b> and a Tongan sea spirit, respectively).|$|E

50|$|While subsectors are {{guaranteed}} to be in order, the <b>sprites</b> within them are not. Doom stores a list of <b>sprites</b> to be drawn ("vissprites") and sorts the list before rendering. Far away <b>sprites</b> are drawn before close ones. This causes some overdraw but usually this is negligible.|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{the small}} size of NES <b>sprites,</b> most moving objects are made of {{multiple}} ones. Only 8 <b>sprites</b> can be drawn per scanline, and so the PPU contains an [...] "overflow" [...] flag that is set if more than 8 <b>sprites</b> appear on a scanline.|$|R
5|$|The {{game was}} {{released}} to generally positive reviews, with critics praising its gameplay and <b>sprite</b> animation quality. While the Sega Saturn port received praise {{for maintaining the}} experience of the original arcade version, the PlayStation port was met with mixed to negative critical reception for removing several features, such as tag team battles. The changes were done in response to the technical limitations of the PlayStation. A sequel to the game, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, was released in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the first}} two Uranian moons were {{discovered}} in 1787, they were not named until 1852, a year after two more moons had been discovered. The responsibility for naming was taken by John Herschel, son of the discoverer of Uranus. Herschel, instead of assigning names from Greek mythology, named the moons after magical spirits in English literature: the fairies Oberon and Titania from William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, and the sylphs Ariel and Umbriel from Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock (Ariel is also a <b>sprite</b> in Shakespeare's The Tempest). The reasoning was presumably that Uranus, as god {{of the sky and}} air, would be attended by spirits of the air.|$|E
5|$|In the game's present, Nagi's {{descendant}} and self-proclaimed greatest warrior, Susano, {{refuses to}} believe in Nagi's legend and frees Orochi, who escapes and curses the lands, sapping the life from Nippon. Sakuya, the wood <b>sprite</b> and guardian of Kamiki Village, calls forth Amaterasu, the sun goddess, known to the villagers as the reincarnation of the white wolf Shiranui, and asks her to remove the curse that covers the land. Accompanied by the artist Issun (an inch-high creature known as a Poncle), Amaterasu begins to restore the land to its normal state.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Transient Luminous Events (TLEs) {{are light}} {{emissions}} {{that occur in}} middle and upper atmosphere above thunderstorms. The most well-known and well-documented of these events are <b>sprites.</b> Usually <b>sprites</b> are associated with electric fields produced by positive cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning. On March 04 th, 2006 <b>sprites</b> were observed above a Mesoscale Convective System (MCS) over Paraguay during a field campaign. A total of 94 <b>sprites</b> were observed. <b>Sprites</b> occur predominantly on storms with high vertical development. The difference between Water Vapor (WV) and Infrared (IR) weather satellite channels is an important parameter to assess {{the depth of the}} storm and infer how penetrative are the clouds. WV IR > 0 implies overshooting cases. About 80 % of the <b>sprites</b> observed in this study occurred over regions with a positive difference between the WV and IR channels. The assessment of this parameter is the first approach of a new methodology to study these phenomena, <b>sprites...</b>|$|R

5|$|The <b>Sprite</b> Slam Dunk Contest was contested by {{defending}} champion Dwight Howard, 2006 champion Nate Robinson, 2005 contestant J. R. Smith and rookie Rudy Fernández. Fernández won the online voting on NBA.com {{to determine the}} fourth contestants, beating fellow rookies Joe Alexander and Russell Westbrook. This {{was the first time}} a dunk contestant was chosen by the fans. Fernández also became the first ever international player to participate in the contest. Smith was named as a late replacement for Rudy Gay, who was forced to withdraw from the contest due to injury.|$|E
5|$|The series' {{first three}} titles, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, and Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes, {{received}} praise for their frantic gameplay style, visual flair, playable character rosters, {{and the quality}} of their <b>sprite</b> animations. The games' Dreamcast and Sega Saturn ports were also lauded for their technical performance, matching the capabilities of the arcade versions. Conversely, the PlayStation ports were criticized for their removal of tag team battles and noticeable decline in frame rate and animation quality – changes which stemmed from the console's RAM limitations.|$|E
5|$|The {{setting and}} events of Strange Journey are {{unrelated}} {{to any other}} entry in the Shin Megami Tensei series. The game {{is set in the}} early 21st century on the continent of Antarctica. During the game's opening, a massive atomic collapse occurs at the South Pole, causing the creation of the , a black void which swallows anything it touches and threatens to engulf the Earth. The space within the Schwarzwelt is occupied by spaces representing the many vices of humanity, acting as a critique of them. The main bases are special amphibious vehicles: Red <b>Sprite</b> No. 1, the protagonist's vehicle, Blue Jet No. 2, Elves No. 3, and Gigantic No. 4.|$|E
5000|$|Spectran <b>Sprites</b> - Bombo, Popo {{and other}} Spectran <b>Sprites</b> are {{native to the}} diamond planet Spectra (Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer). Unlike Rainbow Land <b>Sprites,</b> they have spherical antennae. Their furry feet are useful in {{polishing}} the surface of Spectra. Many wear goggles and are of lighter, cool colors like ice blue, lavender and gray. The Spectran <b>Sprites</b> (with the exception of Popo) were enslaved by Glitterbots when the Dark Princess attempted to steal Spectra for her own.|$|R

50|$|The act of {{creating}} <b>sprites</b> {{is a form}} of pixel art. It is sometimes referred to as <b>spriting,</b> especially in the hobbyist community.|$|R
5|$|Zelenin and Jimenez {{respectively}} {{side with}} Law and Chaos, while a resurrected Gore becomes Neutral. Depending on the choices {{made during the}} game, the protagonist has the choice of allying with either Law, Chaos or following a Neutral route and continuing with the original mission. If he sides with Law, the protagonist and Zelenin defeat both Jimenez and Mem Aleph before using the Cosmic Eggs to create a World of Law, with Zelenin worshiped as a channel to God for humanity, which is forced to surrender its free will. If he sides with Chaos, he and Jimenez help Mem Aleph and defeat Zelenin, using the Eggs to fulfill the Schwarzwelt's original purpose and create a world where humans and demons live together in a primal world where only the strong survive. In both the Law and Chaos routes, Arthur chooses to destroy his new personality to save the protagonist after the Red <b>Sprite</b> is damaged by Gore. If the protagonist rejects Law and Chaos, Gore transmits the necessary information {{for the destruction of}} the Schwarzwelt to him before truly passing on. After defeating Zelenin, Jimenez, and Mem Aleph, the protagonist and surviving crew escape in the Red <b>Sprite</b> while Arthur sacrifices himself to ensure the destruction of the Schwarzwelt, although there is a chance of it reappearing if humanity continues its abuse of the Earth.|$|E
5|$|DMA Design founder David Jones began {{developing}} Walker {{following the}} release of Blood Money in 1989. The inspiration for the game's mech originated in a <b>sprite</b> from Lemmings (1991) originally designed for Blood Money. The graphics and animation for Walker were designed by Scott Johnston, who later worked on Hired Guns (1993). Johnston, a freelancer at the time, wrote a small program to correctly render the walker's head in position, which could then be altered in Deluxe Paint. In early 1990, Jones scrapped Walker because the design was not coming together, and began development on a new game called Gore!; this was soon scrapped. Following {{the completion of the}} Commodore 64 and TurboGrafx-16 ports of Shadow of the Beast, Jones hired Ian Dunlop and Neill Glancy to continue working on Walker; Glancy redesigned the game. Raymond Usher wrote the game's soundtrack.|$|E
5|$|Due to the Famicom's {{restricted}} hardware capabilities, the remake {{is entirely}} two-dimensional. Special compensation {{was made for}} some of the in-battle sprites such as Cloud Strife's, combining two 16x24 pixel sprites side-by-side instead of the usual single <b>sprite</b> to account for weapons such as Cloud's sword or Barret's gun. While most Japanese games use only 8x8-pixel hiragana or katakana fonts, and most Chinese games use 4-color 16x16-pixel tiles stored in dedicated CHR ROM pages, this game uses its own several-hundred 16x16-pixel monochrome font instead. The script itself is strewn in chunks across the code; {{at the beginning of each}} piece of text for dialog boxes is a three digit number preceded by an @-symbol, signifying which character portrait to display.|$|E
