A number of tools were created during the early 1990s to address the problem.|$|E

40|$|For {{part-time}} <b>sysadmins,</b> {{a record}} of past actions is an invaluable tool that provides guidance in repairing or extending system services. However, requiring <b>sysadmins</b> to keep a detailed log of changes made to a live system can often seem like a low priority task when compared to addressing long and growing to-do lists. This problem is worse if the system administrator is a part-time volunteer and an overworked student. In this paper we present Trackle, an integrated trouble ticket and solution tracking system which takes the legwork out of creating and maintaining this sort of institutional memory. Furthermore, Trackle is designed to allow untrained student <b>sysadmins</b> to bootstrap their knowledge by peeking over the shoulders of their more experienced colleagues – even if those colleagues graduated years earlier. We accomplish this by tracking the exact actions taken by <b>sysadmins,</b> showing what lines were changed and in which configuration files. We allow experienced and inexperienced <b>sysadmins</b> alike to freely annotate and cross-reference these shell session logs through an integrated Wiki web interface...|$|R

2500|$|The Greek {{wiretapping}} case of 2004-05, {{also referred}} to as Greek Watergate, involved the illegal telephone tapping of more than 100mobile phones on the Vodafone Greece network belonging mostly to members of the Greek government and top-ranking civil servants. The taps began sometime near the beginning of August 2004 and were removed in March 2005 without discovering the identity of the perpetrators. The intruders installed a rootkit targeting Ericsson's AXE telephone exchange. According to IEEE Spectrum, this was [...] "the first time a rootkit has been observed on a special-purpose system, in this case an Ericsson telephone switch." [...] The rootkit was designed to patch the memory of the exchange while it was running, enable wiretapping while disabling audit logs, patch the commands that list active processes and active data blocks, and modify the data block checksum verification command. A [...] "backdoor" [...] allowed an operator with <b>sysadmin</b> status to deactivate the exchange's transaction log, alarms and access commands related to the surveillance capability. The rootkit was discovered after the intruders installed a faulty update, which caused SMS texts to be undelivered, leading to an automated failure report being generated. Ericsson engineers were called in to investigate the fault and discovered the hidden data blocks containing the list of phone numbers being monitored, along with the rootkit and illicit monitoring software.|$|E

30|$|In {{previous}} sections we {{have discussed}} {{the role of the}} operations team in a reasonably abstract manner. Operations is a core part of any large organisation and as technology, knowledge and work culture has evolved so to have the roles which comprise operations. For the last 20 years the maintenance of software and hardware systems has fallen under the preview of a system administrator. For the longest time operations and system administration were largely interchangeable. <b>Sysadmins</b> have typically been responsible for a broad and often ill-defined range of maintenance and deployment roles of which monitoring inevitably is a large component. System administrators are not developers or software engineers, they do not typically implement new software or modify current systems. Therefore when a monitoring tool reports a fault with an application it is beyond their responsibilities to delve into application code in order to resolve the issue and prevent its reoccurrence. Instead, <b>sysadmins</b> are typically limited to altering configuration, system settings and other tuneable parameters in order to resolve an issue. If a problem arises with an application which cannot be fixed by <b>sysadmins</b> then generally, the problem is communicated to development staff who then resolve the problem. Often communication between these two groups is facilitated through issue trackers, project management software or other collaboration tools. As monitoring is the prerogative of the administrator (and due to the administrator-developer divide) monitoring tools have typically produced performance metrics, status codes, failure notifications and other values that are of direct use to the administrator. This leads to administrators using monitoring tools in a reactive manner: they take corrective action when a monitoring tool alerts them.|$|R
