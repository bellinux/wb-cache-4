40|$|The Hollow Cylinder Apparatus (HCA) is {{the only}} soil test device that can {{facilitate}} independent control of both the magnitudes and directions of the principal stresses. The stress history and loading conditions {{at a point in}} a soil deposit can be reproduced on a Hollow Cylindrical (HC) specimen, and its constitutive behaviour and pore-pressure response measured. However, shortcomings in the equipment, instrumentation and the procedural approaches can potentially invalidate the test results obtained from existing HCAs. Measurement and process control limitations confine their operation to static testing over the strain range from 0. 0001 to 0. 20. Many of the existing HCAs are incapable of generalised stress path testing. A new HCA that can simulate the complex loading conditions at a point in a soil deposit, on a hollow cylindrical test specimen, was developed. It facilitates accurate measurements of the specimen?s constitutive and pore-pressure responses over the complete strain range during stress path testing or displacement-controlled loading. Test specimen dimensions, which limit the stress non-uniformity during testing to an acceptable level, were identified. A sample preparation apparatus was also developed and a technique was perfected to reconstitute saturated sand specimens in the new apparatus. The research and development of the new HCA?s cell, its pressure systems, the <b>servo-mechanisms,</b> which displace and rotate the loading piston, their instrumentation and ancillary equipment, are described. Linear actuators control the hydraulic systems, which apply the inner and outer confining pressures and the back-pressure to the specimen. Innovative <b>servo-mechanisms,</b> which induce an axial force and a torque across the specimen, are mounted beneath the cell {{so that it can be}} readily assembled and disassembled by an operator. The cell?s tie bars are located inside its acrylic cylinder and the load path through it is extremely stiff. The <b>servo-mechanisms</b> can quasi-statically or dynamically load specimens of all soil types, weak rock and pavement base materials in direct compression, extension or pure torsion, to failure. They can also apply tensile normal stresses to the test specimen to facilitate investigations into the engineering properties of materials other than soil. The mechanisms have a low inertia, zero backlash and insignificant compliance values. The axial force, torque and the confining pressures that are applied and the specimen 2 ̆ 7 s polar deformational, pore-pressure and volume change responses can be accurately measured. Its static deformational response can be measured over the specimen?s zone of uniform stress, near its mid-height using instruments located inside the cell. These instruments can be remotely relocated during a test to accommodate the specimen?s deformational response. The control sensitivity of the pressure systems and <b>servo-mechanisms</b> and the instruments 2 ̆ 7 resolution and accuracy values are sufficient to facilitate low amplitude cyclic testing in order to determine the soil?s quasi-elastic constitutive properties. The specimen 2 ̆ 7 s boundary displacements can also be measured using instruments located outside the cell. They facilitate dynamic measurements over the reduced strain range from the order of 10 - 4 strain, to failure. A hollow-shaft type encoder was uniquely incorporated in this instance to measure the specimen 2 ̆ 7 s twist. The <b>servo-mechanisms</b> can readily produce the high-speed response, which is necessary to facilitate accurate dynamic testing. A complementary control system was integrated in the new HCA with the aim of developing a fully automated stress path and displacement-controlled test device. Test specimens of 71 mm inner diameter, 100 mm outer diameter and 200 mm high were selected in view of theoretical and practical considerations. These dimensions also facilitate the testing of undisturbed samples. The development of the sample preparation apparatus and the technique, which employs the wet-pluviation method followed by tapping that was perfected, is described. This technique can consistently reconstitute specimens with a uniform controlled density and their dimensions have excellent repeatability...|$|R

40|$|The {{flight control}} systems, {{designed}} {{in order to}} assure the necessary safety level even in failure conditions, are generally characterized by a proper redundant layout. The redundancies must be designed in order to assure an adequate system behavior when some failures are present; in fact an incorrect layout may cause serious shortcomings concerning the response when some component is not operational. Therefore the usual correct design activities request the complete analysis of the system behavior in failure condition. The work analyses the response of a redundant secondary flight control hydraulic <b>servo-mechanism</b> equipped with some proper equalization devices, {{when some of the}} most probable and representative failures are present. It must be noted that the redundancy layout, designed in order to assure the necessary safety level even in failure conditions, may behave improperly during normal operations, if the system architecture is unsuitable, when manufacturing defects are present. The improper behavior, generally consisting of force fighting or speed fighting caused by different offsets or asymmetries between the two sections of the system, may be usually overcome by means of a suitable equalization device. Therefore, the system behavior during and following the failure transient greatly depends on both its redundancy architecture and related equalization device.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{adaptive}} suppression of disturbances on Blu-ray disc drives <b>servo-mechanisms.</b> The proposed methodology is intended for enhancing playability of low quality media at higher rotational speeds. One of the main problems in controlling an optical disc drive concerns the control of the radial lens position which assures the disc playback. However, due to the rotary nature of the Blu-ray disc the most important sources of disturbances concern those that present periodic behaviour. The frequency of such disturbances is proportional to the disc speed and inversely depends on the radial lens position, making more difficult the task of the tracking-controller when a high speed playback is required. Here, a new parametric adaptation algorithm is proposed to reject the main narrow-band disturbances without increasing the controller bandwidth. The proposed scheme makes use of the internal model principle and the Youla–Kucera parameterization. The parametric adaptation algorithm together with the robust stability and performance analysis are part of the main contribution of this paper.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{illustrates}} {{the application of}} Multibody System Dynamics (MSD) coupled to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for the aeroelastic analysis of detailed aircraft models undergoing arbitrary free flight motion. Computational AeroServoElasticity (CASE) requires the concurrent modeling of rather different aspects of aeromechanics, including rigid body dynamics, structural flexibility, fluid flow, <b>servo-mechanisms</b> for actuators. Considering all these issues within a single monolithic solver is particularly difficult, and possibly not worth the effort. An efficient alternative consists in building CASE modeling capability using independently developed software for each single domain: structure, fluid and mechanism analysis. The partitioned approach relies on dedicated software based on the most appropriate techniques to address the dynamics of each specific field. Efficiency is guaranteed since each subsystem can be modeled independently and only the time and spatial scales of interest are considered. Another advantage is the great flexibility in setting up the model: the designer can indeed choose the most appropriate tools, trading accuracy for computational costs, demanding for higher-order fidelity methods only when simplified ones cannot be applied, or their validation is required.
