5|$|Hydroquinone lightens {{the skin}} when applied topically by {{inhibiting}} tyrosinase, the enzyme responsible for converting the amino acid tyrosine {{to the skin}} pigment melanin, and is used to treat acne-associated postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. By interfering with new production of melanin in the epidermis, hydroquinone leads to less hyperpigmentation as darkened skin cells are naturally shed over time. Improvement in skin hyperpigmentation is typically seen within six months when used twice daily. Hydroquinone is ineffective for hyperpigmentation affecting deeper layers of skin such as the dermis. The use of a sunscreen with SPF15 or higher {{in the morning with}} reapplication every two hours is recommended when using hydroquinone. Its application only to affected areas lowers the risk of lightening the color of normal skin but can lead to a temporary ring of lightened skin around the hyperpigmented area. Hydroquinone is generally well-tolerated; side effects are typically mild (e.g., skin irritation) and occur with use of a higher than the recommended 4% concentration. Most preparations contain the preservative <b>sodium</b> <b>metabisulfite,</b> which has been linked to rare cases of allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and severe asthma exacerbations in susceptible people. In extremely rare cases, repeated improper topical application of high-dose hydroquinone has been associated with an accumulation of homogentisic acid in connective tissues, a condition known as exogenous ochronosis.|$|E

40|$|Bitter gourd (Momordica charantia) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{vegetables}} in Southeast Asia. It is a member of the cucurbit family and is also known as bitter melon or balsam pear. It is a good source of ascorbic acid and is used in the treatment of infectious diseases. It is anti-diabetic, stimulant, stomachic, laxative, blood purifier and control diabetes. This seasonal vegetable can be made available for the consumers in off seasons also in the form of juice. The juice can be made shelf stable by using various chemical additives. Therefore, the aim of the experiment was to compare the effect of different chemical additives namely <b>Sodium</b> benzoate, Potassium <b>metabisulfite</b> (KMS) and their combination, on the physicochemical and phytochemical parameters and antioxidant activity of Bitter gourd juice. The storage was done for 6 months at room temperature and the analysis was conducted at the interval of one month. For the physicochemical parameters like TS, TSS, acidity and Total Phenols, very slight but non-significant change was observed. Color values (Lab), Vitamin C and antioxidant activity changed significantly (p≤ 0. 05). The variation was found in the color of different samples. Considering all the parameters, samples treated with potassium metabisulfite (KMS) maintained the maximum nutrient stability...|$|R
40|$|The {{differential}} lead-zinc flotation {{process has}} been practised since 1912, yet selectivity in the process remains a significant technical issue in many operations. The minerals processing operation at Zinifex Limited's Century Mine, which uses differential flotation, began in November 1999 and the flotation behavior of the ore remains a major research interest. The present study was aimed to determine the possible mechanisms of sphalerite recovery during carbon pre-flotation and lead flotation in this operation including identification of the variables that affect these two flotation stages and also identify depressants for sphalerite that offer better selectivity during these stages. To achieve this aim, the study was undertaken in two stages: a review of literature related to selectivity during lead-zinc flotation, and an experimental program consisting of bench-scale flotation tests wherein the various experimental variables were systematically varied. A comparison between the data generated {{to those of the}} plant was also undertaken. The review of literature revealed four basic mechanisms of sphalerite recovery: activation of the sphalerite surface, composite particle flotation with galena and gangue, graphitic inclusions in the mineral surface and entrainment in the froth. The depression or rejection of sphalerite on the other hand could be affected by grinding, froth washing and the use of chemical depressants including cyanides, zinc sulfate, abraded iron and iron sulfate, sodium sulfide, <b>sodium</b> sulfite and <b>metabisulfite,</b> and organic depressants derived from selective collectors. The results from the experimental program indicate that: (a) activation of the sphalerite surface as a mechanism of sphalerite recovery during lead flotation was not significant at the Century Mine concentrator, (b) the recovery of sphalerite during the carbon pre-flotation was predominantly due to a bulk flotation action and entrainment in the froth, (c) composite particle recovery was a significant contributing factor in the recovery of sphalerite in lead flotation, and (d) mineral oxidation was only significant for galena and occurred mostly during pre-flotation, but the use of cyanide adequately counters any effect on sphalerite recovery. The investigation on the variables that affect the pre-flotation and lead flotation circuits revealed that: (a) reducing the pulp density and the amount of frother added during pre-flotation significantly reduced the bulk flotation action and entrainment of sphalerite in the froth, b) grinding the ore finer (P 80 = 40 μm) reduced the recovery of sphalerite as composite particles during lead flotation, and (c) the pulp pH was best maintained at natural pH during pre-flotation and at an elevated alkaline pH (pH 9. 5) during lead flotation for optimal selectivity. In terms of depressants it was found that zinc sulfate specifically depressed sphalerite during lead flotation...|$|R

25|$|For {{external}} exposure, bathing the {{mucous membrane}} surfaces that have contacted capsaicin with oily compounds such as vegetable oil, paraffin oil, petroleum jelly (Vaseline), creams, or polyethylene glycol {{is the most}} effective way to attenuate the associated discomfort; since oil and capsaicin are both hydrophobic hydrocarbons the capsaicin that has not already been absorbed into tissues will be picked up into solution and easily removed. Capsaicin can also be washed off the skin using soap, shampoo, or other detergents. Plain water is ineffective at removing capsaicin, as are bleach, <b>sodium</b> <b>metabisulfite</b> and topical antacid suspensions.

Some individuals may be so sensitive that low dose aspirin therapy can increase risk for both atopy and WDEIA.|$|E
