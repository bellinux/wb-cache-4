25|$|At {{the same}} time as AM radio began, {{telephone}} companies such as AT were developing the other large application for AM: sending multiple telephone calls through a <b>single</b> <b>wire</b> by modulating them on separate carrier frequencies, called frequency division multiplexing.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 70s serial {{analogue}} protocols were developed. These multiplexed {{a series of}} analogue levels onto a <b>single</b> <b>wire,</b> with embedded clocking signal similar to a composite video signal (in the case of Strand Lighting's European D54 standard, handling 384 dimmers) or separate clocking signal (in {{the case of the}} US standard AMX192).|$|E
25|$|A {{quadruplex}} telegraph {{is a type}} {{of electrical}} telegraph which allows a total of four separate signals to be transmitted and received on a <b>single</b> <b>wire</b> at the same time. With two signals in each direction, quadruplex telegraphy thus implements a form of multiplexing. The quadruplex telegraph was invented by Thomas Alva Edison in 1874, which enabled Western Union to save money by greatly increasing the number of messages the company could send without building new lines. It also allowed the company to use its existing lines more efficiently to meet seasonal increases in message traffic and to lease excess capacity for private lines.|$|E

25|$|When {{designing}} a device capable of computing, {{it is often}} necessary to convert parallel data lines into a serial data stream. This conversion allows different pieces of data to {{be reduced to a}} time-dependent series of values on a <b>single</b> <b>wire.</b> Figure 9 shows such a parallel-to-serial conversion QCA device. The numbers on the shaded areas represent different clocking zones at consecutive 90-degree phases. Notice how all the inputs are on the same clocking zone. If parallel data were to be driven at the inputs A, B, C and D, and then driven no more for at least the remaining 15 serial transmission phases, the output X would present the values of D, C, B and A –in that order, at phases three, seven, eleven and fifteen. If a new clocking region were to be added at the output, it could be clocked to latch a value corresponding to any of the inputs by correctly selecting an appropriate state-locking period.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} magnetoconductance of topological {{insulator}} nanowires in a longitudinal magnetic field, including Aharonov-Bohm, Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak, perfectly conducting channel, and universal conductance fluctuation effects. Our {{focus is on}} predicting experimental behavior in <b>single</b> <b>wires</b> in the quantum limit where temperature is reduced to zero. We show that changing the Fermi energy E_F can tune a wire from from ballistic to diffusive conduction and to localization. In both ballistic and diffusive <b>single</b> <b>wires</b> we find both Aharonov-Bohm and Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak oscillations with similar strengths, accompanied by quite strong universal conductance fluctuations (UCFs), all with amplitudes between 0. 3 G_ 0 and 1 G_ 0. This contrasts strongly with the average behavior of many wires, which shows Aharonov-Bohm oscillations in the ballistic regime and Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak oscillations in the diffusive regime, with both oscillations substantially larger than the conductance fluctuations. In <b>single</b> <b>wires</b> the ballistic and diffusive regimes can be distinguished by varying E_F and studying {{the sign of the}} AB signal, which depends periodically on E_F in ballistic wires and randomly on E_F in diffusive wires. We also show that in long wires the perfectly conducting channel is visible at a wide range of energies within the bulk gap. We present typical conductance profiles at several wire lengths, showing that conductance fluctuations can dominate the average signal. Similar behavior will be found in carbon nanotubes...|$|R

The {{direction of the}} electromotive force is given by Lenz's law which states that an induced current will flow in the direction that will oppose the change which produced it.

To increase the generated EMF, a common approach is to exploit flux linkage by creating a tightly wound coil of wire, composed of N identical turns, each with the same magnetic flux going through them. The resulting EMF is then N times that of one <b>single</b> <b>wire.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Cincinnati {{was one of}} {{only three}} cities in North America whose streetcars used double {{overhead}} trolley wire (two wires for each track) and twin trolley poles on each streetcar, the only others being Havana, Cuba, and the small Merrill, Wisconsin system. All routes used double trolley wire, the only exception being on route 78, a portion of which outside the city limits had only a <b>single</b> <b>wire</b> for each track. [...] On all other North American streetcar systems the rails served as the return path for the electric current collected via the trolley pole, but this requires proper bonding of the rails to prevent stray current from escaping and interfering with nearby utility lines, such as telephone lines. In Cincinnati, the primary early streetcar operating company, the Cincinnati Street Railway, chose to install double-wire from the beginning, to save money.|$|E

Two short thick wires were {{selected}} to serve as terminations, by which contact could be made or broken with the electromotor. The compound helix, consisting of i and ii (1053.), was adjusted so that the extremities of the two helices could be placed in communication with the two terminal wires, {{in such a manner}} that the current moving through the thick wires should be divided into two equal portions in the two helices, these portions travelling, according to the mode of connexion, either in the same direction or in contrary directions at pleasure. In this manner two streams could be obtained, both of which could be stopped simultaneously, because the disjunction could be broken at G or F by removing a <b>single</b> <b>wire.</b> When the helices were in contrary directions, there was scarcely a sensible spark at the place of disjunction; but when they were in accordance there was a very bright one.|$|E

Several of the effects, as, for instances, {{those with}} helices(1066.), with {{according}} or counter currents (1097. 1098.), {{and those on}} the production of lateral currents (1090.), appeared to indicate that a current could produce an effect of induction in a neighbouring wire more readily than in its own carrying wire, in which case it might be expected that some variation of result would be produced if a bundle of wires were used as a conductor instead of a <b>single</b> <b>wire.</b> In consequence the following experiments were made. A copper wire one twenty-third of an inch in diameter was cut into lengths of five feet each, and six of these being laid {{side by side in}} one bundle, had their opposite extremities soldered to two terminal pieces of copper. This arrangement {{could be used as a}} discharging wire, but the general current could be divided into six parallel streams, which might be brought close together, or, by the separation of the wires, be taken more or less out of each other's influence. A somewhat brighter spark was, I think, obtained on breaking contact when the six wires were close together than when held asunder.|$|E
