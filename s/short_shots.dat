5|$|Aronofsky's {{first two}} films, Pi and Requiem for a Dream, were low-budget and used montages of {{extremely}} <b>short</b> <b>shots,</b> {{also known as}} hip hop montages. While an average 100-minute film has 600 to 700 cuts Requiem for a Dream features more than 2,000. Split-screen is used extensively, along with extremely tight closeups. Long tracking shots, including those shot with an apparatus strapping a camera to an actor, called the Snorricam, and time-lapse photography are also prominent stylistic devices. Often with his films, Aronofsky alternates between extreme closeups and extreme wide shots {{to create a sense}} of isolation.|$|E
25|$|The {{movement}} of the batsman for a particular delivery depends on the shot being attempted. Front-foot shots are played with the weight on the front foot (left foot for a right-hander) and are usually played when the ball is pitched up to the batsman, while back-foot shots are played putting the weight onto the back foot, usually to bowling that is pitched <b>short.</b> <b>Shots</b> may also be described as vertical bat shots, in which the bat is swung vertically at the ball (e.g. when playing a drive or leg glance), or horizontal or cross-bat shots, in which the bat is swung horizontally at the ball (e.g. when playing the pull or cut shot).|$|E
500|$|The {{fight between}} Mulder and X was heavily edited by Fox's {{broadcast}} standards department. Despite {{the fact that}} most of the action was done by stunt doubles, Steven Williams was injured during the filming of the fight scene. The opening scene with the restaurant shooting was filmed mostly on two handheld cameras, with director R. W. Goodwin using a variety of <b>short</b> <b>shots</b> and rapid cuts to different perspectives. This was done to create a chaotic scene which would contrast with how the character of Thinnes' character Jeremiah Smith was presented—shots focused on him were filmed using a Steadicam to allow the character to seem [...] "rock steady". The film used was also overcranked, where the frame rate of the recording is much higher than that which will be played back, slowing down the footage when it is played at a normal frame rate. This gave a slow motion effect to Thinnes' movements, in order to aid the [...] "Godlike" [...] impression Goodwin wanted.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an evaluation of}} a plastic defect in injection molding before it occurs in the process; it {{is known as the}} <b>short</b> <b>shot</b> defect. The evaluation of different parameters which affect the possibility of <b>short</b> <b>shot</b> defect is the aim of this paper. The analysis of <b>short</b> <b>shot</b> possibility is conducted via SolidWorks Plastics and Taguchi method to determine the most significant parameters. Finite Element Method (FEM) is employed to analyze two circular flat polypropylene plates of 1 mm thickness. Filling time, part cooling time, pressure holding time, melt temperature and gate type are chosen as process and geometric parameters, respectively. A methodology is presented herein to predict the possibility of the short-shot occurrence. The analysis determined melt temperature is the most influential parameter affecting the possibility of <b>short</b> <b>shot</b> defect with a contribution of 74. 25 %, and filling time with a contribution of 22 %, followed by gate type with a contribution of 3. 69 %. It was also determined the optimum level of each parameter leading to a reduction in the possibility of <b>short</b> <b>shot</b> are gate type at level 1, filling time at level 3 and melt temperature at level 3. Finally, the most significant parameters affecting the possibility of <b>short</b> <b>shot</b> were determined to be melt temperature, filling time, and gate type...|$|R

2500|$|The {{field was}} just barely {{large enough to}} fit a {{baseball}} diamond. [...] In order to shoehorn even an approximation of a baseball field onto the playing surface, the left-field fence was set at only [...] from the plate.

They also expressed concern that cherished home run records, especially Babe Ruth's 1927 seasonal mark of 60, might easily fall as a result of 250-foot pop flies going over the left-field fence. Sports Illustrated titled a critical editorial [...] "Every Sixth Hit a Homer!" [...] Players, too, complained, with Milwaukee Braves' ace Warren Spahn calling for a rule that would require any home run to travel at least [...] before it could be considered a home run.|$|E

5000|$|Lob wedges can be {{used for}} a variety of shots {{including}} pitch and runs and pitching over an obstacle, particularly shots requiring a very high arc, a large amount of backspin or both. [...] Pitching over an obstacle is used in situations where a hazard of some sort, usually a water hazard, bunker or tree, is located in the line of the shot between the ball's current location and the target (often on the putting green). By utilizing a lob wedge for these <b>short</b> <b>shots,</b> the ball is carried much higher in the air than with a standard iron causing significantly less roll on the landing surface. This is most often important for <b>short</b> <b>shots</b> into difficult pin placements. [...] Before the invention of the lob wedge, or to create a shot similar to the lob wedge, the golfer was required to perform the shot with a sand wedge or pitching wedge and to modify the shot by cutting across the ball making a glancing blow, a much riskier shot.|$|E
