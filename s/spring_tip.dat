50|$|A banana {{connector}} (commonly {{banana plug}} for the male, banana socket or banana jack for the female) is a single-wire (one conductor) electrical connector used for joining wires to equipment. The term 4 mm connector is also used, especially in Europe, {{although not all}} banana connectors will mate with 4 mm parts. The plug is typically a four-leafed <b>spring</b> <b>tip</b> that fits snugly into the jack. The plugs are frequently used to terminate patch cords for electronic test equipment.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn {{experimental}} {{approach for}} producing relative charge density maps of biological surfaces using the {{atomic force microscope}} is presented. This approach, called D minus D (D–D) mapping, uses isoforce surfaces collected at different salt concentrations to remove topography and isolate electrostatic contributions to the tip-sample interaction force. This approach is quantitative for surface potentials below 25 mV, and does not require prior knowledge of the cantilever <b>spring</b> constant, <b>tip</b> radius, or tip charge. In addition, D–D mapping does not require tip-sample contact. The performance of D–D mapping is demonstrated on surfaces of constant charge and varying topography (mechanically roughened mica and stacked bilayers of dipalmitolphosphatidylserine), a surface of varying charge and varying topography (patches of dipalmitolphosphatidylcholine on mica), and bacteriorhopsin membranes adsorbed to mica...|$|R

40|$|In (hand) tips- grasping, {{an object}} is {{constrained}} by multiple tips of fingers which apply forces to an object. The IPC grasping controller introduced in [2], gives a physi-cally based methodology to implement an Intrinsically Passive Control (IPC) strategy {{in order to}} grasp with either a multi finger hand or manipulation with multiple arms. This strategy has been successfully implemented and extended in different applications as also reported in [4]. The idea which is schematically reported in Fig. 1, {{is based on a}} (virtual) physically inspired controller composed of a number of geometric springs (contact <b>springs)</b> connecting the <b>tips</b> of the fingers of the hand (or the end of the multi limb system) to a virtual object. This virtual object is by itself connected to a new spring which can be used to move the all ensemble around. The goal of the virtual object is to create damping injection in the system in order to achieve a proper be-haviour. The grasping is obtained by changing the lengths of the contact <b>springs</b> once the <b>tips</b> are positioned around the objects to be grasped. Changing the lengths of the springs in a geometrical consistent way, can be done as explained in [3]...|$|R

50|$|A minimum metal mine is a {{land mine}} that is {{designed}} to use the smallest amount of metal possible in its construction. Typically, the only metal components are located inside the fuze mechanism which triggers detonation. Both minimum metal anti-tank and anti-personnel mines exist. Some designs contain virtually no metal at all e.g. less than a gram. This is achieved by encasing the explosive charge in a plastic, wooden, or glass body, with metallic components limited to the few small parts in the fuze which can not easily be made from other materials, such as the <b>spring,</b> striker <b>tip,</b> and shear pin. Minimum metal mines are extremely difficult to detect using conventional metal mine detectors and usually require modern techniques, such as robotic Multi Period Sensing (MPS) equipment, to identify, but it is still too difficult to find non-metallic mines. These techniques are usually restricted to well-funded international mine clearing organizations and major militaries, making minimum metal mines especially pernicious where they are encountered.|$|R

40|$|A {{theoretical}} and experimental study {{is made to}} investigate the effect on plate vibrations of varying the stiffness of corner elastic point supports. A theoretical model is developed using a Rayleigh-Ritz analysis which approximates the plate mode shapes as products of free-free beam modes. The elastic point supports are modelled both as massless translational springs, and <b>springs</b> with <b>tip</b> masses. The tip masses are included to better represent the experimental supports. An experiment is constructed using the bending stiffness of horizontal beams to support a square plate at its four corners. The stiffness of these supports can be varied over such a range that the plate fundamental frequency is lowered to 40 % of the rigid support frequency. The variation with support stiffness of the frequencies of the first eight plate modes is measured, and compared with the theoretical results. The plate mode shapes for rigid supports are analyzed using holographic interferometry. There is excellent agreement between the {{theoretical and}} experimental results, except for high plate modes where the theoretical model is demonstrated to be inadequate...|$|R

A cantilever beam with a nonlinear <b>spring</b> at its <b>tip</b> serves to illustrate the developments.

5000|$|After {{graduating from}} Michigan, Rehor played {{professional}} football. In October 1917, {{he joined the}} Massillon Tigers. [...] When {{it was announced that}} Rehor would join the Tigers, The Evening Independent in Massillon ran a feature story on Rehor, billing him as the [...] "Newest Tiger Giant." [...] The article noted:"Rehor, who graduated from Michigan last <b>spring,</b> <b>tips</b> the beam at 255 pounds. He stands nearly six feet tall {{and was one of the}} big men on the Michigan eleven for three seasons. The Michigan giant will arrive here early Saturday morning. He comes here backed by a reputation of being one of the best linemen who played college foot ball in 1916. He should be a tower of strength to the Tiger line, especially when the big battles with Akron, Canton and Youngstown are staged."Rehor started at right guard in Massillon's 14 - 6 victory over Buffalo. After the game, The Evening Independent wrote: [...] "Rehor with his 256 odd pounds bowled over the visiting linemen and formed a defensive bulwark that couldn't be budged." [...] After a 3 - 0 loss to Akron, the paper noted that the team put up a strong battle on defense with Rehor and Copley (playing at right guard and right tackle) playing [...] "strong defensive games, tackling hard and accurately." [...] In a 28 - 0 victory over the Columbus Panhandles, Rehor also handled kickoffs. After the game, the Massillon paper wrote: [...] "Exhibiting the same stonewall defense that has characterized their play all season, the Tigers had little trouble in stopping the battering tactics of the Panhandles ... The visitors made four first down but three of them came on forward passes and the other on a penalty. Gains through the Tiger line were few and far between as Nash, Copley, Thornhill, Wesbecher, Rehor and Rambaud were in every mixup and dropped the heavy Panhandle backs in their tracks most of the time." [...] During the fourth quarter of the last game of the regular season, Rehor got into a fight with [...] "Unk" [...] Russell of the Canton Bulldogs, and both were ejected by the referee. The Massillon newspaper reported: [...] "Rehor claimed that Russell had slugged him in scrimmage. Fritz's fighting blood became warm and he wasn't long opening hostilities with the giant Pennsylvanian. Fists flew freely for a few seconds but the mix up was stopped without damage to either player." ...|$|R

5000|$|The tip of an épée {{comprises}} several parts including: the mushroom-shaped movable tip; its housing or [...] "barrel", {{which is}} threaded to the blade; a contact spring; {{and a return}} <b>spring.</b> The <b>tips</b> are generally {{held in place by}} two small grub screws, which thread into the sides of the tip through elongated openings {{on either side of the}} barrel. The screws hold the tip within the barrel but are allowed to travel freely in the openings. While this is the most common system, screwless variations do exist. The return spring must allow the tip to support a force of 750 g-f N without registering a touch. Finally, an épée tip must allow a shim of 1.5 mm to be inserted between the tip and the barrel, and when a 0.5 mm shim is inserted and the tip depressed, it should not register a touch. The contact spring is threaded in or out of the tip to adjust for this distance. These specifications are tested at the start of each bout during competitions. During competitions, fencers are required to have a minimum of two weapons and two body wires in case of failure or breakage.|$|R
