5|$|In 1996, Lexus debuted {{its first}} <b>sport</b> <b>utility</b> vehicle, the LX 450, {{followed}} by the third generation ES 300 sedan. The marque's plans for developing an SUV model had accelerated during the U.S.-Japan tariff discussions of 1995. Lexus added the first luxury-branded crossover SUV, the RX 300, and the second generation GS 300 and GS 400 sedans in 1998. The RX crossover targeted suburban buyers who desired an upmarket SUV but did not need the LX's off-road capability. It was particularly successful, eventually becoming the marque's top-selling model ahead of the ES sedan. The same year, Lexus made its debut in South America's most populous country when it launched sales in Brazil. In 1999, Lexus recorded its 1 millionth vehicle sold in the U.S. market and was ranked the top-selling premium car maker in the U.S. overall.|$|E
