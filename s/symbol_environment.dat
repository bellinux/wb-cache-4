An analysis of vandalism from a situational-positivistic, or a motivational-psychological, approach hardly gives an understanding of vandalism as a meaningful individual and social act. A humanistic and cultural perspective can supply ways to understand a nonprescribed behavior such as vandalism. The original meaning of vandalism is plundering and laying waste of a civilization's <b>symbols</b> and <b>environment.</b> This appropriation of physical environment also occurs in the industrialized societies' urban environment and then often is perceived as motiveless. "Free zones" develop in societies where norms and obligations are neutralized. Vandalism is nonprescribed in that it appears in these free zones where norms, obligations, utility, and common sense are switched off. The environment is "marked" by damaging or destroying objects to change {{the message of the}} physical milieu. Vandalism is a gesture of "negative honor," which reflects a complex of feelings. Vandalism comprises two sides of an autonomy problem: to be isolated from an unwanted membership (juvenile vandalism) and to be free of an unwanted outside position (adult vandalism).

30|$|However, the {{mechanisms}} by which sex and gender identity exert influence on entrepreneurs’ growth intentions and the moderating influences that constitute boundary conditions of the theory {{are in need of}} further investigation. Self-construal is such a potential moderator of the relationship between gender, gender identity, and growth intentions. Self-construal refers to individuals’ culturally contingent thoughts, feelings, and actions that are concerned with one’s understanding of the self as connected to others (interdependent self-construal) or distinct from others (independent self-construal) (Markus & Kitayama, 1991). Individuals’ exposure to certain conditions can increase the likelihood they exhibit independent (individualistic) or interdependent (collectivistic) tendencies (Hong et al., 2000). The concepts of “entrepreneur” and “entrepreneurship” are considered male-gendered (Ahl, 2006; Lewis, 2006). Cues or <b>symbols</b> in the <b>environment</b> that entrepreneurs utilize to operate their business could make independent self-construal more accessible (Hong et al., 2000), since the masculine identity highlights individuals’ unique attributes (Cross & Madson, 1997). A systematic consideration of the potential moderating effects of self-construal will contribute to a fuller understanding of the conditions under which the effects of sex on growth intentions are more likely to hold.|$|R
40|$|This paper explores, from a {{narrative}} perspective, the organizational change process {{resulting from a}} string of take-overs within a tire manufacturing company in Spain. It elaborates {{on the effects of}} these changes in the way people reconstruct the organization and their role as its employees through the stories they share. These stories compose a collectively reproduced narrative that guides, and therefore constrains, employees' historical recollections. They are the vehicle through which people reproduce and challenge their cultural order in the organization through their (re) production and generation within that order. It is by way of narratives and the space they create that people are able to make sense of a changing situation using both their personal experiences and the <b>symbols</b> their cultural <b>environment</b> provides. Storytelling becomes then the constant process of reformulation that opens a space for the development of individual awareness and competence within the cultural constraints that the organization imposes on its members. These findings imply that we should take the discursive elements that both constrain our descriptions and our explanations of organizational change process seriously, and if possible provide opportunities for more or less intentional (re) interpretations of those processes when planning organizational interventions...|$|R

The intent is not simply to oppose their work, but to explore a tension which has implications for the ethical dimension of this emerging discipline. Uexküll’s functional cycle {{is associated with the}} image of a circle, which, while emphasizing the integration of organism and environment, is shown to invoke solipsism, and an overly deterministic depiction of ecological relations. Peirce’s drawing of a labyrinth is taken to represent a maze, which, while exemplifying the evolutionary play of ecosystems, may entail a level of unpredictability that is catastrophically chaotic. The root of these diverging depictions is identified with the role of subjectivity in engendering semiotic relations in {{the work of}} both Uexküll and Peirce. Where the more regressive aspects of Uexküll’s theoretical biology are mitigated by a teleological interpretation of life’s underlying causality, orientating agency within Peirce’s work depends upon attention to the idea of the self in his philosophy of signs.

In other words, it aims at demostrating how the Croatian Međimurje County may become recognizable as a tourist destination on the basis of its ethnographic heritage, which exists even today in different ways. The first part of the paper deals with the role of image in the choice of destination and defines the term “destination image”. A particular emphasis is placed on the analysis of the impact of autochthonous music on the image of the Međimurje County. It proves the thesis that autochthonous music plays an important role in the presentation and dissemination of the recognizable image of Međimurje. As shown in this paper, the music of Međimurje is a resource characterized by dynamism, change and adaptability. It is also a source of inspiration of numerous musicians and, thanks to its uniqueness in terms of authenticity, representativeness or rarity, it becomes a quality <b>symbol</b> of the <b>environment</b> in which it came to be. In this sense, the paper offers an insight into the way in which the music of Međimurje might be used to improve the understanding and acceptance of certain communication content by making the message clearer and easier to understand. It is evident that the market evaluated the autochthonous music of Međimurje in the past and will continue to evaluate it to an increasing extent in the future, so claims about its incompatibility with commercialism and utilitarianism may only be accepted conditionally. The second part of the paper includes a description of the methodological frame of the field research that has been conducted as well as a report on its results. In this way, the analysis of the role which the music of Međimurje plays in the creation of image acquires its concrete meaning, since the results of the research can be interpreted with regard to their assumptions and their efficiency in practice...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} developed out of {{an interest}} to clarify people's values and to relate these to a repertoire of past, present and future behavioural or environmental patterns. Cognitive maps, derived from Repertory Test and Laddering techniques, directly illustrate this relationship between superordinate values and subordinate behaviours, objects, <b>symbols</b> and <b>environments.</b> Repertory Test and Laddering Technique are associated with Personal Construct Psychology. This dissertation describes Personal Construct Psychology and related methodology as founded by Kelly (1955). It then follows one branch of the further development of the theory. The second generation developments of Hinkle (1965) are examined, followed by subsequent developments and applications; particularly those of Little (1983) and Eden (1977, 1978, 1980, 1988). Using an action research approach, the methods developed by these personal construct psychologists, were applied to problems in three organisational interventions : 1. an individual client vocational-redundancy counselling situation, 2. an intervention with a work group who were experiencing dysfunctional internal relationships and, 3. in a team-building intervention with the inaugural Board of Trustees of a Primary School. In all cases the procedure used Repertory Test and Laddering procedures to identify individual cognitive maps. In the latter projects these were aggregated to form group cognitive maps, and in all cases the final intent was to produce a policy or specification for action. A pre-test post-test untreated control groups design {{was used in the}} final study to assess the comparative progress and development of three school Boards of Trustees. In the vocational-redundancy counselling case, the procedure provided the client with a policy for action that he could use to guide future career and lifestyle behaviours. It revealed both lack of control over one's anticipated future and the need to reconstrue one's future, as sources of negative response to severance for this client. The study clearly demonstrated the notion that a construct is defined by that which is both superordinate and subordinate to it, and in particular enabled the client to define what his religious beliefs meant to him. In subsequent studies this method of construct definition formed the basis of a procedure for the content analysis of cognitive maps, describing them verbally and for aggregating them into collective cognitive maps. With the dysfunctional work group, identification of a collective cognitive map formed a description of the groups functions and was translated into a statement of purpose. It was also useful for enhancing self awareness, organisational awareness and for clarifying both group and individual role. In the team building intervention with a school's Board of Trustees, the Treatment group displayed not only improvement on more scales than the control groups, but also improvement of greater magnitude than the control groups. This data supported the Treatment group's self report of benefits gained from the intervention. The intervention provided the Board with a guiding policy for action, which they were then able to apply directly to formal policies required by statute. It was demonstrated, therefore, in three separate organisational contexts, that an applied personal construct, cognitive map approach, based on repertory test and laddering techniques, was viable for intervention purposes where role clarification, values clarification and formation of a policy for action was desired. Methods were refined for portraying cognitive maps and expressing these verbally. Issues surrounding organisation development content analysis of construct systems and the role of action research were discussed. The processes and findings of the dissertation were related back to the theory of personal construct psychology. Kelly founded Personal Construct Psychology in the applied setting, and it is claimed that it is in the applied setting that it displays particular power...|$|R

ABSTRACT Experimental research in creativity suggests an inter-relationship between the physical environment and individual creativity. But can the physical environment also influence the creative problem-solving process in organizations, which depend as much on the organization?s processes as the individual people for their creative production? To begin to answer this question, this study examines {{the impact of the}} physical environment on the creative problem-solving process of a highly acclaimed, European consulting firm which specializes in ?ideas?. The research design employs a hybrid methodology, which combines traditional case study method with narrative inquiry. Data on how the physical environment was perceived to impact this firm?s creative problem-solving process was gathered through open ended, semi-structured interviews of the organization?s key employees, including the project managers, CEOs of a typical project, and also through direct, informal observation of the creative problem-solving process. Key clients from the project case were also interviewed. Published material on the organization and the organization?s official Web site was used to collect additional data. All interview data was taped, transcribed verbatim, analyzed for major themes. A narrative or story was then developed using Labov?s six-point framework. The narrative entitled ?The Tacit Dimension? gives a real account of the client?s subjective experience of the creative problem-solving process and how the physical environment influences it. Results indicate three major functions of the physical environment in supporting creative problem solving: 1) knowledge management, 2) symbolic communication, 3) functional support. The first major function of the physical environment in supporting creative process is to create and dissipate knowledge to both employees and clients alike, about the functioning of the creative problem solving process ? knowledge management The second major function employs signs and <b>symbols</b> in the <b>environment</b> to build appropriate expectations and mindsets which support a healthy creative problem solving process ? symbolic communication. The narrative shows that the clients depended on the symbolism embedded within the physical environment of the organization as an assurance of its creative ability thereby making them more receptive to nontraditional procedures and building trust in the process. The symbolic communication also promoted the creative problem solving abilities in the employees. Lastly, the environment should be functional to support idea generation by allowing adequate flexibility ? functional support. By providing spaces that efficiently support the work processes but are also flexible enough to adapt and improvise, creatively and functionally empowers the employees to generate creative ideas...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} several decades, the topic of child {{development}} in a cultural context has received {{a great deal of}} theoretical and empirical investigation. Investigators from the fields of indigenous and cultural psychology have argued that childhood is socially and historically constructed, rather than a universal process with a standard sequence of developmental stages or descriptions. As a result, many psychologists have become doubtful that any stage theory of cognitive or socialemotional development can be found to be valid for all times and places. In placing more theoretical emphasis on contextual processes, they define culture as a complex system of common symbolic action patterns (or scripts) built up through everyday human social interaction by means of which individuals create common meanings and in terms of which they organize experience. Researchers understand culture to be organized and coherent, but not homogenous or static, and realize that the complex dynamic system of culture constantly undergoes transformation as participants (adults and children) negotiate and re-negotiate meanings through social interaction. These negotiations and transactions give rise to unceasing heterogeneity and variability in how different individuals and groups of individuals interpret values and meanings. However, while many psychologists—both inside and outside the fields of indigenous and cultural psychology–are now willing to give up the idea of a universal path of child development and a universal story of parenting, they have not necessarily foreclosed on the possibility of discovering and describing some universal processes that underlie socialization and development-in-context. The roots of such universalities would lie in the biological aspects of child development, in the evolutionary processes of adaptation, and in the unique symbolic and problem-solving capacities of the human organism as a culture-bearing species. For instance, according to functionalist psychological anthropologists, shared (cultural) processes surround the developing child and promote in the long view the survival of families and groups if they are to demonstrate continuity in the face of ecological change and resource competition, (e. g. Edwards 2 ̆ 6 Whiting, 2004; Gallimore, Goldenberg, 2 ̆ 6 Weisner, 1993; LeVine, Dixon, LeVine, Richman, Leiderman, Keefer, 2 ̆ 6 Brazelton, 1994; LeVine, Miller, 2 ̆ 6 West, 1988; Weisner, 1996, 2002; Whiting 2 ̆ 6 Edwards, 1988; Whiting 2 ̆ 6 Whiting, 1980). As LeVine and colleagues (1994) state: A population tends to share an <b>environment,</b> <b>symbol</b> systems for encoding it, and organizations and codes of conduct for adapting to it (emphasis added). It is through the enactment of these population-specific codes of conduct in locally organized practices that human adaptation occurs. Human adaptation, in other words, is largely attributable to the operation of specific social organizations (e. g. families, communities, empires) following culturally prescribed scripts (normative models) in subsistence, reproduction, and other domains [communication and social regulation]. (p. 12) It follows, then, that in seeking to understand child development in a cultural context, psychologists need to support collaborative and interdisciplinary developmental science that crosses international borders. Such research can advance cross-cultural psychology, cultural psychology, and indigenous psychology, understood as three sub-disciplines composed of scientists who frequently communicate and debate with one another and mutually inform one another’s research programs. For example, to turn to parental belief systems, the particular topic of this chapter, it is clear that collaborative international studies are needed to support the goal of crosscultural psychologists for findings that go beyond simply describing cultural differences in parental beliefs. Comparative researchers need to shed light on whether parental beliefs are (or are not) systematically related to differences in child outcomes; and they need meta-analyses and reviews to explore between- and within-culture variations in parental beliefs, with a focus on issues of social change (Saraswathi, 2000). Likewise, collaborative research programs can foster the goals of indigenous psychology and cultural psychology and lay out valid descriptions of individual development in their particular cultural contexts and the processes, principles, and critical concepts needed for defining, analyzing, and predicting outcomes of child development-in-context. The project described in this chapter is based on an approach that integrates elements of comparative methodology to serve the aim of describing particular scenarios of child development in unique contexts. The research team of cultural insiders and outsiders allows for a look at American belief systems based on a dialogue of multiple perspectives...|$|R
