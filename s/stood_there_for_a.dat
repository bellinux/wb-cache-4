500|$|One {{formality}} left were New York's late-in-the-season primary {{elections on}} September 12, {{which in this}} case merely served to ratify the state party conventions' choices. [...] Lazio won unopposed, while Clinton won 82percent of the vote in easily defeating unknown Manhattan doctor Mark McMahon, who ran on the grounds that [...] "the Clintons have tried to hijack the Democratic Party." [...] For her part, Clinton said that she was [...] "surprised, in a way [...] I <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> minute, staring at my name." [...] In any case, the general election was already well underway.|$|E

If a lion chases you to the bank of a river filled with crocodiles, you will leap into the water, convinced {{you have a chance to}} swim to the other side." [...] The donor heart came from a young woman, Denise Darvall, who had been rendered brain dead in an accident on 2 December 1967, while crossing a street in Cape Town. On examination at Groote Schuur hospital, Darvall had two serious fractures in her skull, with no electrical activity in her brain detected, and no sign of pain when ice water was poured into her ear. [...] Coert Venter and Bertie Bosman requested permission from Darvall's father for Denise's heart to be used in the transplant attempt. The afternoon before his first transplant, Barnard dozed at his home while listening to music. [...] When he awoke, he decided to modify Shumway and Lower's technique. [...] Instead of cutting straight across the back of the atrial chambers of the donor heart, he would avoid damage to the septum and instead cut two small holes for the venae cavae and pulmonary veins. [...] Prior to the transplant, rather than wait for Darvall's heart to stop beating, at his brother Marius Barnard's urging, Christiaan had injected potassium into her heart to paralyse it and render her technically dead by the whole-body standard. Twenty years later, Marius Barnard recounted, [...] "Chris <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few moments, watching, then stood back and said, 'It works.'" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{sprang to}} his feet and <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, unsteadily.|$|E
60|$|Thinking of all this, he <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> hour {{alone with}} his hands in his trousers' pockets.|$|R
60|$|What {{a breath}} I drew! But I felt so weak and shaky that I {{had to take}} hold {{of the side of}} the scow, and <b>stand</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while before I waded ashore. The boy who was {{standing}} by me was Rectus. He did not have that name then, and I didn't know him.|$|R
5000|$|In July 2016, Caine {{changed his}} name by deed poll to his long-time stage name {{in order to simplify}} {{security}} checks at airports. [...] "security guard would say, 'Hi Michael Caine,' and suddenly I’d be giving him a passport with a different name on it Joseph Micklewhite. I could <b>stand</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> hour. So I changed my name." ...|$|R
60|$|Dale <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> blank moment, and then, {{taking up}} his rifle, he strode away.|$|E
60|$|She {{crossed the}} room towards the {{hearthrug}} and <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, leaning against the mantelpiece.|$|E
60|$|The {{young man}} <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while waiting, {{and then walked}} off with a loud laugh.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If,' {{said the}} other, {{retaining}} his hand while he spoke; 'if {{when you come}} back, you miss me from my old corner, and should hear from anyone where I am lying, come and look upon my grave. Think that I might have been as honest and as happy as you! And let me think, when I know time is coming on, that some one like my former self may <b>stand</b> <b>there,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, and remember me with pity and forgiveness! Walter, good-bye!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, look here, sonny, <b>stand</b> right <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> minute, will you, while I go out? I won't be gone a great while, an' you {{can finish}} up your breakfast." ...|$|R
60|$|She took {{both his}} hands and held them <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment. Then {{she walked to the}} door, made sure that it was {{securely}} fastened, and <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> listening <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment.|$|R
60|$|He fitted the {{combination}} and swung open the door. He <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, speechless. Something in his attitude attracted the Inspector's attention.|$|E
60|$|As he ceased {{speaking}} the doctor moved quietly {{up to the}} side of the stretcher, put his finger on his wrist, and <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> minute, then he bent down and listened.|$|E
60|$|As we <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, spellbound by {{the sight}} of those fearsome creatures occupying the very thrones of the sovereigns of England, the low growl was repeated, and a great male rose slowly to his feet.|$|E

60|$|Kenneth {{pushed back}} {{his chair and}} rose from the table. He {{walked to the window}} and <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> {{whistling}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few moments, and then left the room without a word.|$|R
50|$|The woman <b>stands</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while, {{then she}} {{goes back into the}} bathroom, with Sloan right behind her. She picks up a picture of the two of them, and throws it into the toilet, symbolizing the end of the relationship. She takes a {{toothbrush}} and then walks through Sloan, who becomes transparent--making a reference to how he was never really <b>there</b> <b>for</b> her. She goes out of the bathroom, to the door, and stops to look back at the band playing. Sloan looks at her, then looks away. She leaves the house, presumably for good.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite certain. He {{suddenly}} appeared {{by the side}} of that gray bowlder, <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, and sunk down again. I expect he must have got a view of one of the men somewhere along the top." ...|$|E
6000|$|Carryl came up {{with the}} lady on his arm; and as he <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, in the coolest, most {{indifferent}} tone in the world, said, [...] "Oh! by the by, Miss Ellis, let me present my friend Mr. Seymour." ...|$|E
60|$|He <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> minute very sorrowful, {{and then}} 'e patted both their 'eads and went downstairs. Ginger and Peter lay {{listening}} for a bit, {{and then they}} turned their pore bound-up faces {{to each other and}} tried to talk with their eyes.|$|E
40|$|You {{had to see}} it {{to believe}} it.

6000|$|With {{a fierce}} leap as of a maniac, {{he was at}} the door, pounding, rattling, and uttering hoarse and furious outcries. Even through his fury he heard quickened footsteps--her light, reckless, half-hysterical laugh--a bound upon the staircase--the hurried {{unbolting}} and opening of distant doors, as the lighter one with which he was struggling at last yielded to his blind rage, and threw him crashing into the sitting-room. The back door was wide open. He could hear the rustling and crackling of twigs and branches in different directions down the hillside, where the fugitives had separated as they escaped. And yet he <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant, dazed and wondering, [...] "What next?" ...|$|R
60|$|There was a solemnity and {{profound}} quietude about {{the scene and}} the hour which harmonised well with the sedate spirit of the young Eskimo, as he <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time contemplating the wonders and the beauties {{of the world around}} and about him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hullo!" [...] said Mr. Scogan, {{catching}} {{him by the}} arm; {{dazed and}} hardly conscious {{of what he was}} doing or where he was, Denis <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment like a somnambulist. [...] "What's the matter?" [...] Mr. Scogan went on. [...] "you look disturbed, distressed, depressed." ...|$|E
60|$|Juanna saw also, and {{springing}} {{forward on}} to a rock, <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{moment in the}} full glare of the sun. Instantly a murmur went up from the host; a great voice called a command; the barbs of steel flickered like innumerable stars, and sank downwards.|$|E
6000|$|He <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> silent <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, looking, not at her, but at {{the costly}} {{ornaments}} which stood {{at the foot of}} the huge pier-glass over the fireplace. Why did he not go now? why did he <b>stand</b> <b>there</b> silent and thoughtful? why--why was he so cruel to her? ...|$|R
6000|$|He <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> sulky <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, {{and then}} 'e invented a noise that nothing living could miss hearing; even Bill couldn't. He moved in 'is sleep, and arter Silas 'ad done it twice more {{he turned and}} spoke to 'is missis about it. [...] "D'ye hear?" [...] he ses; [...] "stop it. Stop it at once." ...|$|R
60|$|When I {{came home}} to dinner my uncle {{had not yet been}} home. Still it was early. I sat staring at the clock for some time and, when its ticking began to irritate me, I left the room. I mounted the {{staircase}} and gained {{the upper part of the}} house. The high cold empty gloomy rooms liberated me and I went from room to room singing. From the front window I saw my companions playing below in the street. Their cries reached me weakened and indistinct and, leaning my forehead against the cool glass, I looked over at the dark house where she lived. I may have <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> hour, seeing nothing but the brown-clad figure cast by my imagination, touched discreetly by the lamplight at the curved neck, at the hand upon the railings and at the border below the dress.|$|R
60|$|The officer {{bowed and}} hastened from the {{apartment}} in search of Butzow. The girl approached the window and <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time, {{looking out at the}} surging multitude that pressed around the palace gates, filling Margaretha Street with a solid mass of happy faces.|$|E
60|$|Blanche silently {{crossed the}} room to the sofa on which Anne was sitting, and <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, looking at her. She sat down, and laid her head on Anne's shoulder. Sorrowfully and quietly, she put the letter into her bosom--and took Anne's hand, and kissed it.|$|E
60|$|David had <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{few minutes}} {{like a man}} stunned. Then he had {{turned and walked away}} up the lane under the birches. He said nothing--then or at any other time. From that day no {{reference}} to his wife or her concerns ever crossed his lips.|$|E
60|$|I <b>stood</b> <b>there,</b> resting, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment, preparatory {{to turning}} and {{retracing}} my {{steps to the}} launch, when, without warning, something whizzed through space straight toward me. There was a dull thud of impact as it struck the tree, and as I dodged {{to one side and}} {{turned to look at the}} thing I saw a heavy spear imbedded in the wood not three inches from where my head had been.|$|R
60|$|I {{stood waiting}} and watching, hands shading my eyes, expecting every moment to {{distinguish}} him. Very probably I <b>stood</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> quite <b>a</b> long time. I tried to shout, and {{was reminded of}} the thinness of the air. I made an undecided step back towards the sphere. But a lurking dread of the Selenites made me hesitate to signal my whereabouts by hoisting one of our sleeping-blankets on to the adjacent scrub. I searched the crater again.|$|R
50|$|After {{submitting}} it and {{not hearing}} a response, he becomes worried {{and returns to the}} publishers, Pleyel & Desjardins, to ask about it. No one there knows what happened to it, and do not seem to care. Claudin persists, but Maurice Pleyel rudely tells him to leave and goes back to the etchings he was working on. Finally giving up, Claudin <b>stands</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment and hangs his head sadly. Someone begins to play music in the next room, and he looks up in shock when he hears it. It is his concerto that is merely being endorsed and praised by Franz Liszt. Convinced that Pleyel is trying to steal his concerto, Claudin leaps up and begins to strangle him. Just as he tosses the body of Pleyel to the floor, Georgette, the publisher's assistant, throws etching acid at Claudin. Screaming and wailing, he dashes out the door clutching his face. Now being hunted down by the police for murder, he flees to the sewers of the Opera. Claudin steals a prop mask from the costume department to cover his now-disfigured face.|$|R
