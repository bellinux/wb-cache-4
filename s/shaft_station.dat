They were single-storey structures {{to allow for}} future commercial development above and had elevations faced in beige terracotta. Each station had lifts manufactured by the Sprague Electric Company in New York. The lifts were provided {{in a variety of}} sizes and configurations to suit the passenger flow at each station. Generally they operated in sets of two or three in a shared <b>shaft.</b> <b>Station</b> tunnel walls were finished in plain white ceramic tiles and lit by electric arc lamps. The electricity to run the trains and the stations was supplied from the power station at Wood Lane at 5,000V AC which was converted at sub-stations along the route to 550V DC to power the trains via a third rail system.|$|E
50|$|At {{locations}} where the Shaft Barrel meets horizontal workings {{there is a}} <b>Shaft</b> <b>Station</b> which allows men, materials and services to enter and exit the shaft. From the station tunnels (drifts, galleries or levels) extend towards the ore body, sometimes for many kilometers. The lowest <b>Shaft</b> <b>Station</b> is most often the point where rock leaves the mine levels and is transferred to the shaft, if so a Loading Pocket is excavated {{on one side of}} the shaft at this location to allow transfer facilities to be built.|$|E
50|$|Beneath {{the lowest}} <b>Shaft</b> <b>Station</b> the shaft {{continues}} {{on for some}} distance, this area {{is referred to as}} the Shaft Bottom. A tunnel called a Ramp typically connects the bottom of the shaft with the rest of the mine, this Ramp often contains the mine's water handling facility, called the Sump, as water will naturally flow to the lowest point in the mine.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{document}} {{as stated in the}} ''Technical Work Plan for Subsurface Design Section FY 01 Work Activities'' (CRWMS M&O 2001 a, pg. 14) is to review and evaluate the most current concepts for shaft siting and configuration. The locations of the shaft sites will be evaluated in reference to the overall subsurface ventilation layout shown in Figure 1. The scope will include discussions on pad size requirements, shaft construction components such as collars, <b>shaft</b> <b>stations,</b> sumps, ground support and linings, head frames, fan ducting and facility equipping. In addition to these, shaft excavation methodologies and integration with the overall subsurface construction schedule will be described. The Technical Work Plan (TWP), (CRWMS M&O 2001 a), for this document has been prepared in accordance with AP- 2. 21 Q, ''Quality Determinations and Planning for Scientific, Engineering and Regulatory Compliance Activities''. This document will be prepared in accordance with AP- 3. 10 Q, ''Analysis and Models''. This document contributes to Site Recommendation (SR).

40|$|In {{order to}} {{properly}} design a shaft {{it is necessary}} to acquire full information about the rock mass in the exploration area. It is especially crucial {{in the case of the}} deposit of an unusual vertical intrusion shape, occurring at a great depth. Such a situation implies that the shaft lining design must take into consideration not only the geomechanical properties of the rock mass but also the virgin stresses (often having significant values). In this paper, the methodology of the shaft lining and <b>shaft</b> <b>station</b> lining design for a deep shaft is presented based on the Victoria Mine located in Canada. Taking into consideration the geological structure as well as the results of the laboratory tests, the properties of the rock mass were derived. Next, the numerical calculation was performed based on the elasto-plastic model of the rock mass. The numerical analysis consisted of simulation of the multistage technology of the shaft excavation and lining execution. This allowed to estimate the forces in rock bolts of the temporary ground support as well as stresses in the final concrete lining of the shaft...|$|E

40|$|The U 1 H Shaft Project is {{a design}} build {{subcontract}} {{to supply the}} U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) a 1, 045 ft. deep, 20 ft. diameter, concrete lined shaft for unspecified purposes. The subcontract awarded to Atkinson Construction by Bechtel Nevada to design and construct the shaft for the DOE has been split into phases with portions of the work being released as dictated by available funding. The first portion released included the design for the shaft, permanent hoist, headframe, and collar arrangement. The second release consisted of constructing the shaft collar {{to a depth of}} 110 ft., the service entry, utility trenches, and installation of the temporary sinking plant. The temporary sinking plant included the installation of the sinking headframe, the sinking hoist, two deck winches, the shaft form, the sinking work deck, and temporary utilities required to sink the shaft. Both the design and collar construction were completed on schedule. The third release consisted of excavating and lining the shaft to the station depth of approximately 950 feet. Work is currently proceeding on this production sinking phase. At a depth of approximately 600 feet, Atkinson has surpassed production expectation and is more than 3 months ahead of schedule. Atkinson has employed the use of a Bobcat 331 excavator as the primary means of excavation. the shaft is being excavated entirely in an alluvial deposit with varying degrees of calcium carbonate cementation. Several more work packages are expected to be released in the near future. The remaining work packages include, construction of the <b>shaft</b> <b>station</b> a depth of 975 ft. and construction of the shaft sump to a depth of 1, 045 ft., installation of the loading pocket and station steel and equipment, installation of the shaft steel and guides, installation of the shaft utilities, and installation of the permanent headframe, hoist, collar utilities, and facilities...|$|E

40|$|This Geotechnical Analysis Report (GAR) {{presents}} and interprets geotechnical {{data from the}} underground excavations at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). The data, which are obtained {{as part of a}} regular monitoring program, are used to characterize conditions, to compare actual performance to the design assumptions, and to evaluate and forecast the performance of the underground excavations. GARs have been available to the public since 1983. During the Site and Preliminary Design Validation (SPDV) Program, the architect/engineer for the project produced these reports quarterly to document the geomechanical performance during and immediately after early excavations of the underground facility. Since completion of the construction phase of the project in 1987, the management and operating contractor for the facility has prepared these reports annually. This report describes the performance and condition of selected areas from July 1, 2005, to June 30, 2006. It is divided into nine chapters. Chapter 1 provides background information on WIPP, its mission, and the purpose and scope of the geomechanical monitoring program. Chapter 2 describes the local and regional geology of the WIPP site. Chapters 3 and 4 describe the geomechanical instrumentation in the <b>shafts</b> and <b>shaft</b> <b>stations,</b> present the data collected by that instrumentation, and provide interpretation of these data. Chapters 5 and 6 present the results of geomechanical monitoring in the two main portions of the WIPP underground (the access drifts and the waste disposal area). Chapter 7 discusses the results of the Geoscience Program, which include fracture mapping and borehole observations. Chapter 8 summarizes the results of geomechanical monitoring and compares the current excavation performance to the design requirements. Chapter 9 lists references...|$|R
