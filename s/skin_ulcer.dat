50|$|An ulcer is a sore on {{the skin}} or a mucous membrane, {{accompanied}} by the disintegration of tissue. Ulcers can result in complete loss of the epidermis and often portions of the dermis and even subcutaneous fat. Ulcers are most common {{on the skin}} of the lower extremities and in the gastrointestinal tract. An ulcer that appears on the skin is often visible as an inflamed tissue with an area of reddened skin. A <b>skin</b> <b>ulcer</b> is often visible in the event of exposure to heat or cold, irritation, or a problem with blood circulation. They can also be caused {{due to a lack of}} mobility, which causes prolonged pressure on the tissues. This stress in the blood circulation is transformed to a <b>skin</b> <b>ulcer,</b> commonly known as bedsores or decubitus ulcers. Ulcers often become infected, and pus forms.|$|E

50|$|The wounds {{from which}} ulcers arise {{can be caused}} by a wide variety of factors, but the main cause is {{impaired}} blood circulation.

Cutaneous loxoscelism results from serious bites causing a necrotising <b>skin</b> <b>ulcer</b> in about 50% of bites with destruction of soft tissue and may take months, and rarely years to heal, leaving deep scars.

A sample of 437 people exposed to Class B sludge (living within 1 mi of sludged land) - and using a control group of 176 people not exposed to sludge (not living within 1 mi of sludged land) reported the following: [...] "Results revealed that some reported health-related symptoms were statistically significantly elevated among the exposed residents, including excessive secretion of tears, abdominal bloating, jaundice, <b>skin</b> <b>ulcer,</b> dehydration, weight loss, and general weakness. The frequency of reported occurrence of bronchitis, upper respiratory infection, and giardiasis were also statistically significantly elevated.

40|$|Objective: To {{establish}} {{evidence and}} standards for syndrome differentiation of patients with chronic <b>skin</b> <b>ulcer</b> of lower limbs, {{which can be used}} to supervise and further improve the clinical treatment. The evidence and standards would also lay a foundation for the integrative evaluation system of clinical effects. Methods: This is a prospective study of clinical case collection and analysis. The syndrome factors of chronic <b>skin</b> <b>ulcer</b> of lower limbs were collected from clinical cases, and then the essential factors of syndromes were chosen to make cluster analysis and principal component analysis. After syndrome classification, specialist consultation was performed. Forecasting syndrome models were established {{on the basis of the}} statistical analysis and the specialist consultation. Results: The syndrome factors in 338 cases of chronic <b>skin</b> <b>ulcer</b> of lower limbs were clustered into four syndrome categories including deficiency of both qi and blood, spleen deficiency with dampness encumbrance, qi deficiency with blood stasis and blood stagnation with dampness-heat. The deficiency of both qi and blood, and qi deficiency with blood stasis were merged into qi deficiency with blood stasis by expert revision. The primary and secondary symptoms were identified by principal component analysis and average ranking determined by experts. The qi deficiency with blood stasis, spleen deficiency with dampness encumbrance, and blood stagnation with dampness-heat could reflect the clinical syndrome characteristics in patients with chronic <b>skin</b> <b>ulcer</b> of lower limbs. Conclusion: Chronic <b>skin</b> <b>ulcer</b> of lower limbs can be differentiated in three syndrome types, and differentiation of local symptoms of the ulcer is very important in syndrome differentiation of chronic <b>skin</b> <b>ulcer</b> of lower limbs...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — With Skin Ulcers {{are caused}} {{due to the}} {{increase}} in UV radiation which is caused by the ozone depletion with the culture of the sun. Other causes of skin cancer are burns, scars, sores, radiation or certain chemicals like arsenic. However, if detected earlier all forms of skin cancers are curable. This relies heavily on classifying skin lesion at an early stage. Data from patient concerning both, their individual features and wound origin are collected. <b>Skin</b> <b>ulcer</b> images and medical diagnosis about its grade can be stored, thereby submitting these data to the data mining procedures in order to detect some relations between them. Computationally generating a <b>skin</b> <b>ulcer</b> grade inference can help medical experts to accomplish therapeutic procedures. Also it accelerates healing process towards a better patient life quality with lower medical assistance costs. Detection of Stage I skin ulcers become more difficult by unaided visual inspection and/or by using currently available techniques with subjects having darker skin due to increased melanin content. Therefore they are more prone towards developing Stage –II and Stage –III skin ulcers compared to white patients. It is therefore necessary to develop a low-cost, non-contact, imaging-based Stage-I <b>skin</b> <b>ulcer</b> detection system for use by support staff in assisted living and skilled nursing facilities to increase their ulcer detection rate. Therefore study of necessary algorithms makes it easier to detect <b>skin</b> <b>ulcer</b> and heal the patient rather in early stages. Moreover, classifiers can help in classifying the skin lesion and help dermatologist to diagnose the problem...|$|E

30|$|RV {{has been}} {{reported}} to result primarily from vasculitis of small and medium-sized vessels (Genta* et al. 2006). However, many reports have stated that RV occurs in the aorta, a very large vessel (Sandring and Weil 1961; Falicov and Cooney 1964; Reimer et al. 1976; Rush et al. 1986; Sketchler and Waxman 1987; Mimura 1 and Sueishi 1989; Gravallese et al. 1989; Towned et al. 1991; Nakabayashi et al. 1998; Korkmaz et al. 2001; Miller et al. 2006; Verweij 1 et al. 2012; Mariani and Alexander 2013). RA-associated aortitis essentially occurs in patients with severe RA, indicating an association with RV (Towned et al. 1991). The following risk factors for RV onset have been reported: high-titre rheumatoid factors, course of 1  year or more after the onset, presence of bone erosions, and presence of rheumatoid nodules (Voskuyl et al. 1996). The first two features were observed in our patient. Furthermore, our patient exhibited a <b>skin</b> <b>ulcer,</b> which {{has been reported}} in approximately 90 % of RV patients (Genta* et al. 2006). However, the patient’s skin biopsy showed no findings suggestive of vasculitis. This might be because the biopsy specimen was obtained from a relatively shallow site; vasculitis might have been detected if the deeper dermal layer had been sampled. It is also entirely possible that the <b>skin</b> <b>ulcer</b> was caused by vasculitis based on the following observations: “no findings suggesting history of trauma, pressure ulcer, or infection”; “vasculitis is the first cause suspected when a deep <b>skin</b> <b>ulcer</b> is observed”, as in this patient; “FDG-PET/CT shows FDG uptakes at the ulcer site, suggesting inflammation”; and “the patient responded well to steroid treatment”. Confirmation that our patient’s <b>skin</b> <b>ulcer</b> resulted from vasculitis would satisfy the Scott and Bacon criteria (Turesson and Jacobsson 2004) for RV, and it is entirely possible that the aortitis in our patient was associated with RV.|$|E

RESULTS: An improvement of <b>skin</b> <b>ulcers</b> was observed in 24 / 26 patients; in particular, 22 / 26 wounds completely healed, 2 / 26 showed a partial healing, in only 2 patients <b>skin</b> <b>ulcers</b> did not change during the 6 -month follow-up.
