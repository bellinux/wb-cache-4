5|$|Chemical {{defense is}} another {{important}} defense found among species of Coleoptera and Lepidoptera, usually being advertised by bright colors, such as the monarch butterfly. They obtain their toxicity by <b>sequestering</b> the chemicals from the plants they eat into their own tissues. Some Lepidoptera manufacture their own toxins. Predators that eat poisonous butterflies and moths may become sick and vomit violently, learning not to eat those types of species; this is actually the basis of Müllerian mimicry. A predator who has previously eaten a poisonous lepidopteran may avoid other species with similar markings in the future, thus saving many other species as well. Some ground beetles of the Carabidae family can spray chemicals from their abdomen with great accuracy, to repel predators.|$|E
5|$|Kinne's {{second trial}} {{for the murder of}} James Kinne began on March 23, 1964. As jury {{selection}} got underway that day, the public was initially barred from the proceedings, but the restriction was soon loosened and the media were allowed into the courtroom. An unusually long jury selection process made {{the first day of the}} trial last fourteen hours, beginning at 9 a.m. and not ending until nearly midnight the same day; presiding judge Paul Carver noted that due to the notoriety of the case, he had been forced to choose between <b>sequestering</b> the entire jury pool overnight and forcing the court into a long day. The eventual jury, all men, were immediately sequestered, but days later, a mistrial was declared after it emerged that a law partner of prosecutor Lawrence Gepford had once been retained by one of the jurors.|$|E
5|$|The {{parasite}} {{is relatively}} protected from {{attack by the}} body's immune system because {{for most of its}} human life cycle it resides within the liver and blood cells and is relatively invisible to immune surveillance. However, circulating infected blood cells are destroyed in the spleen. To avoid this fate, the P.falciparum parasite displays adhesive proteins {{on the surface of the}} infected blood cells, causing the blood cells to stick to the walls of small blood vessels, thereby <b>sequestering</b> the parasite from passage through the general circulation and the spleen. The blockage of the microvasculature causes symptoms such as in placental malaria. Sequestered red blood cells can breach the blood–brain barrier and cause cerebral malaria.|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} {{of a range of}} spending cuts beginning automatically on March 1 st due to the <b>sequester</b> remains very real with only a few days remaining until the deadline. The <b>sequester</b> will cut spending, but also likely impact economic recovery and growth. While some may laud the <b>sequester</b> for finally reducing spending, it is also a clumsy tool for making policy relying upon broad, but moderate, cuts rather than more well thought out cuts to specific programs. Despite this, few ordinary Americans are too concerned about the potential <b>sequester...</b>|$|R
5000|$|On February 22, 2013, {{shortly before}} the United States federal budget <b>sequester</b> took effect, The Washington Post {{published}} a column by Woodward in which he criticized the Obama administration for their statements in 2012 and 2013 that the <b>sequester</b> had been proposed by Republicans in Congress; Woodward said his research showed that the <b>sequester</b> proposal had originated with the White House. Press Secretary Jay Carney confirmed, [...] "The <b>sequester</b> {{was something that was}} discussed, and as has been reported, it was an idea that the White House put forward." ...|$|R
50|$|Despite harvesting, biomass crops may <b>sequester</b> carbon. For example, soil {{organic carbon}} has been {{observed}} to be greater in switchgrass stands than in cultivated cropland soil, especially at depths below 30 cm. The grass <b>sequesters</b> the carbon in its increased root biomass. Typically, perennial crops <b>sequester</b> much more carbon than annual crops due to much greater non-harvested living biomass, both living and dead, built up over years, and much less soil disruption in cultivation.|$|R
5|$|Transcription {{produces}} a single-stranded RNA molecule known as messenger RNA, whose nucleotide sequence is complementary to the DNA {{from which it}} was transcribed. The mRNA acts as an intermediate between the DNA gene and its final protein product. The gene's DNA {{is used as a}} template to generate a complementary mRNA. The mRNA matches the sequence of the gene's DNA coding strand because it is synthesised as the complement of the template strand. Transcription is performed by an enzyme called an RNA polymerase, which reads the template strand in the 3' to 5'direction and synthesizes the RNA from 5' to 3'. To initiate transcription, the polymerase first recognizes and binds a promoter region of the gene. Thus, a major mechanism of gene regulation is the blocking or <b>sequestering</b> the promoter region, either by tight binding by repressor molecules that physically block the polymerase, or by organizing the DNA so that the promoter region is not accessible.|$|E
5|$|Being {{frozen in}} an iceberg {{for a hundred}} years while in the Avatar State drained much of Aang's life energy. While he did not feel the effects for many years, after he entered middle age in his 50s, the strain of this {{exertion}} increasingly weighed upon his body. Ultimately, it resulted in Aang dying at the relatively young biological age of 66, in 153 AG. Aang was survived by his wife, Katara, and his three children, but he did not live to see his grandchildren, all of whom would be powerful Airbenders. Prior to his death, Aang tasked the Order of the White Lotus with finding and guiding the new Avatar after him. When Aang died, the Avatar spirit reincarnated into the Southern Water Tribe female Korra. Aang intended for the Order to simply guide and guard Korra, but several mishaps in the aftermath of Aang's death (including a kidnapping attempt by the anarchist Zaheer) and the still-fragile state of relations between the now-Five Nations resulted in Katara and Tenzin <b>sequestering</b> Korra in a compound at the South Pole, bringing teachers to her instead of allowing her to seek out her own.|$|E

25|$|The {{proposed}} deal eliminated some of {{the spending}} cuts required by the <b>sequester</b> by $45 billion of the cuts scheduled to happen in January and $18 billion of the cuts scheduled to happen in 2015. This did not decrease federal spending; instead, by {{reducing the amount of}} spending cuts the government was going to be forced to make by the <b>sequester,</b> it actually increased government spending by $45 billion and $18 billion over what would have been spent had the <b>sequester</b> remained in place. Some Republicans wanted Speaker John Boehner to pursue a temporary measure that would cover the rest of Fiscal Year 2014 at the level set by the <b>sequester</b> – $967 billion, rather than pass this budget deal, which would have $45 billion in additional spending.|$|R

25|$|Carbon dioxide sinks {{that store}} {{carbon dioxide in}} the Earth's crust by injecting it into the subsurface, or in the form of {{insoluble}} carbonate salts (mineral sequestration), are considered carbon negative. This is because they are removing carbon from the atmosphere and <b>sequestering</b> it indefinitely and presumably for a considerable duration (thousands to millions of years). However, Carbon Capture technology remains, at best, theoretical and is yet to reach more than 33% efficiency. Furthermore, this process could be rapidly undone, for example by earthquakes or mining.|$|E
