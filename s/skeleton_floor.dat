40|$|Luminal {{breast cancer}} is the most {{frequently}} encountered type of human breast cancer and accounts for half of all breast cancer deaths due to metastatic disease. We have developed new in vivo models of disseminated human luminal breast cancer that closely mimic the human disease. From initial lesions in the tibia, locoregional metastases develop predictably along the iliac and retroperitoneal lymph node chains. Tumors cells retain their epithelioid phenotype throughout the process of dissemination. In addition, systemically injected metastatic MCF- 7 cells consistently give rise to metastases in the <b>skeleton,</b> <b>floor</b> of mouth, adrenal glands, {{as well as in}} the lungs, liver, brain and mammary fat pad. We show that growth of luminal breast cancer metastases is highly dependent on estrogen in a dose-dependent manner and that estrogen withdrawal induces rapid growth arrest of metastatic disease. On the other hand, even though micrometastases at secondary sites remain viable in the absence of estrogen, they are dormant and do not progress to macrometastases. Thus, homing to and seeding of secondary sites do not require estrogen. Moreover, in sharp contrast to basal-like breast cancer metastasis in which transforming growth factor-beta signaling plays a key role, luminal breast cancer metastasis is independent of this cytokine. These findings have important implications for the development of targeted anti-metastatic therapy for luminal breast cancer...|$|E

Blažek from the Institute of Archaeological Monuments Preservation of North-West Bohemia in Most. Based on ceramic artefacts, <b>skeleton</b> findings, monolithic <b>floor</b> finish and stone artefacts the dating and partial inclusion into a wider framework of the locality in question was performed. All results were compared with those in other selected Bohemian localities.

40|$|Accidental falls are {{the major}} cause of serious {{injuries}} in toddlers, with most of these falls happening at home. Instead of providing immediate fall detection based on short-term observations, this paper proposes an early-warning childcare system to monitor fall-prone behaviors of toddlers at home. Using 3 D human <b>skeleton</b> tracking and <b>floor</b> plane detection based on depth images captured by a Kinect system, eight fall-prone behavioral modules of toddlers are developed and organized according to four essential criteria: posture, motion, balance, and altitude. The final fall risk assessment is generated by a multi-modal fusion using either a weighted mean thresholding or a support vector machine (SVM) classification. Optimizations are performed to determine local parameter in each module and global parameters of the multi-modal fusion. Experimental {{results show that the}} proposed system can assess fall risks and trigger alarms with an accuracy rate of 92 % at a speed of 20 frames per second...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} air-conditioning loads {{by several}} air-conditioning patterns and heat methods of a super high-rise residence {{by using the}} dynamic simulation software “THERB ” (the simulation software of the thermal environment of residential buildings) which can estimate temperature, humidity, sensible temperature, and heating/cooling load for multiple zones of buildings. As high-rise residences, the ratio that the structural <b>skeleton</b> dominates a <b>floor</b> area is bigger than that of ordinary residences, and its skeleton is used concrete generally. Heat capacity has a considerable impact on air-conditioning load of high-rise residences. Meanwhile, aspects of air-conditioning style, heat insulation style, structural form and building direction affect to air-conditioning load of high-rise residences significantly. Recently, high-rise residences are to {{be more and more}} important factor in our life with its rapid development. It is respected that most people will chose high-rise residences, because of its popularization. Therefore, we must reduce energy consumption for keeping environment load reduction in high-rise residences. Based on above mentioned, heat environment impact on high-rise residences will become an important issue in our society...|$|R
60|$|Early that morning, Tarzan of the Apes {{had gone}} to the cabin by the sea, where he passed many an hour at such times as the tribe was ranging in the vicinity. On the <b>floor</b> lay the <b>skeleton</b> of a man--all that {{remained}} of the former Lord Greystoke--lay as it had fallen some twenty years before when Kerchak, the great ape, had thrown it, lifeless, there. Long since had the termites and the small rodents picked clean the sturdy English bones. For years Tarzan had seen it lying there, giving it no more attention than he gave the countless thousand bones that strewed his jungle haunts. On the bed another, smaller, skeleton reposed and the youth ignored it as he ignored the other. How could he know that the one had been his father, the other his mother? The little pile of bones in the rude cradle, fashioned with such loving care by the former Lord Greystoke, meant nothing to him--that one day that little skull was to help prove his right to a proud title was as far beyond his ken as the satellites of the suns of Orion. To Tarzan they were bones--just bones. He did not need them, for there was no meat left upon them, and they were not in his way, for he knew no necessity for a bed, and the <b>skeleton</b> upon the <b>floor</b> he easily could step over.|$|R
