5|$|In November 2006 Jim Crone and Sergeant Major Pete Jackson, senior tunnel guide {{with the}} Royal Gibraltar Regiment, met {{possibly}} {{the only member}} of Operation Tracer still alive when they travelled to meet Dr. W. A. Bruce Cooper at his home in England. Cooper, 92 at the time, provided an opportunity to shed light on the operation with his direct involvement in the mission as a Surgeon-Lieutenant in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve (RNVR). He recalled <b>stories</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> colleagues, his training, and his feelings about the task.|$|E
5|$|Mosley {{identified}} {{his major}} achievement as FIA President as {{the promotion of}} the European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP or Encap). He has also promoted increased safety and the use of green technologies in motor racing. In 2008, <b>stories</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> sex life appeared in the British press, along with unfounded allegations regarding Nazi connotations. Mosley successfully sued the newspaper that published the allegations and maintained his position as FIA president. He stood {{down at the end of}} his term in 2009 and was replaced by his preferred successor, Jean Todt.|$|E
5|$|Rollins {{also has}} toured {{all over the}} world doing spoken word {{performances}} and his shows frequently last for over three hours. His spoken word style encompasses stand up comedy, accounts of experiences he's had in the world of music and during his extensive travels around the globe, self-deprecating <b>stories</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> own shortcomings, introspective recollections from his own life (such as the death of his friend, Joe Cole), commentaries on society and playful, sometimes vulgar, anecdotes.|$|E

5|$|While Jenner was alive, {{very few}} people knew of him, {{and the effects of}} his evangelism were largely unrecognised. After his death, however, <b>stories</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> evangelism {{circulated}} widely. Stories of his evangelistic activities generated a largely oral tradition, and elements of some stories contradicted others. Many storytellers said that Jenner was small in stature and that he had white hair; this description is contradicted by interviews with family members.|$|E
5|$|Until about 1571/1572 Dudley {{supported}} Mary Stuart's succession {{rights to}} the English throne. He was also, from the early 1560s, on the best terms with the Protestant lords in Scotland, thereby supporting the English or, as he saw it, the Protestant interest. After Mary Stuart's flight into England (1568) Leicester was, unlike Cecil, in favour of restoring her as Scottish queen under English control, preferably with a Protestant English husband, such as the Duke of Norfolk. In 1577 Leicester had a personal meeting with Mary and listened to her complaints about her captivity. By the early 1580s Mary had come to fear Leicester's influence with James VI, her son, in whose privy chamber the English Earl had placed a spy. She spread <b>stories</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> supposed lust for the English throne, and when the Catholic anti-Leicester libel, Leicester's Commonwealth, was published in 1584 Dudley believed that Mary was involved in its conception.|$|E
5|$|Walt Disney, {{the creator}} of the {{concepts}} for Disneyland and the Disneyland Railroad, always had a strong fondness for trains. As a young boy, he wanted to become a train engineer like his father's cousin, Mike Martin, who told him <b>stories</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> experiences driving main-line trains on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. As a teenager, he obtained a news butcher job on the Missouri Pacific Railway, selling various products to train passengers, including newspapers, candy, and cigars. Many years later, after co-founding the Walt Disney Company with his older brother Roy O. Disney, he started playing polo. Fractured vertebrae and other injuries led him to abandon the sport on the advice of his doctor, who recommended a calmer recreational activity. Starting in late 1947, he developed an interest in model trains after purchasing several Lionel train sets.|$|E

Having heard <b>stories</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> parents' ancestors, he wanted to visit Africa, which he considered his spiritual home. Delany and three other young black men were accepted into Harvard Medical School but African Americans were not accepted into the school after white students reportedly petitioned the school to exclude non-white applicants.|$|E
25|$|Levi {{was almost}} unrecognisable {{on his return}} to Turin. Malnutrition edema had bloated his face. Sporting a scrawny beard and wearing an old Red Army uniform, he {{returned}} to Corso Re Umberto. The next few months gave him an opportunity to recover physically, re-establish contact with surviving friends and family, and start looking for work. Levi suffered from the psychological trauma of his experiences. Having {{been unable to find}} work in Turin, he started to look for work in Milan.

25|$|In 1942, {{shortly before}} moving to California, Miller began writing Sexus, the first novel in The Rosy Crucifixion trilogy, a fictionalized account documenting the six-year period {{of his life in}} Brooklyn falling in love with June and {{struggling}} to become a writer. Like several of his other works, the trilogy, completed in 1959, was initially banned in the United States, published only in France and Japan. In other works written during his time in California, Miller was widely critical of consumerism in America, as reflected in Sunday After The War (1944) and The Air-Conditioned Nightmare (1945). His Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymus Bosch, published in 1957, is a collection of <b>stories</b> <b>about</b> <b>his</b> life and friends in Big Sur.|$|E
