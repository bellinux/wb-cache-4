50|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determines that}} the {{probable}} {{cause of the}} accident was {{the failure of the}} 18th rail car to properly negotiate a curve because of the inadequate <b>side</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>clearance</b> of the B-end truck assembly, likely due to a broken side bearing wedge plate attachment bolt, which caused a wheel to climb the rail, which derailed the car. Contributing to the derailment was (1) the undesirable contact of the truck bolster bowl rim with the car body center plate and (2) the hollow worn wheels on the 18th car, which further diminished the steering ability of the truck assembly.|$|E

Due to the deviations of dimension and roundness the contact areas between the bearing components cannot be predicted. Hence contact detection is necessary. For this purpose the herein presented concept {{is based on a}} raytrace algorithm.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{influences}} of the <b>bearing</b> <b>clearance,</b> which is a common fault for machines, to the chatter stability of milling process are examined by using numerical simulation method. The results reveal {{that the presence of}} <b>bearing</b> <b>clearance</b> could make the milling process easier to enter the status of chatter instability and can shift the chatter frequency. In addition, the spectra analysis to vibration signals obtained under the instable milling processes show that the presence of <b>bearing</b> <b>clearance</b> could introduce more frequency components to the vibration responses but, however, under both the stable and instable milling processes, the generated frequency components will not violate the ideal spectra structures of the vibration responses of the milling process, which are usually characterized by the tooth passing frequency and its associated higher harmonics for the stable milling process and by the complex coupling of the tooth passing frequency and the chatter frequency for the instable milling process. This implies that, even under the case with <b>bearing</b> <b>clearance</b> fault, the stability of the milling process can still be determined by viewing the frequency spectra of the vibration responses. Moreover, the phenomena of the chatter frequency shift and the generation of more components provide potential ways to detect the <b>bearing</b> <b>clearance</b> in machines. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A {{completely}} {{new type of}} externally pressurized gas thrust bearing is proposed and its static characteristics are analyzed. Unlike conventional gas bearings whose load capacity depends on the viscosity of gas, the load capacity of this new type of bearing is independent of the viscosity of gas since it utilizes the choking phenomenon of gas flow to maintain high pressure in the <b>bearing</b> <b>clearance.</b> Also the change of {{the location of the}} throat generates bearing stiffness. Since the flow is supersonic at the exit of the <b>bearing</b> <b>clearance,</b> the flow conditions downstream of the exit do not affect the flow inside the <b>bearing</b> <b>clearance.</b> Accordingly, the load capacity increases proportionally to the supply pressure. Thus, the main disad-vantage of conventional gas bearings, namely, the deficiency of their load capacity is overcome. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{computational}} work investigates {{planetary gear}} load sharing of three-mount suspension wind turbine gearboxes. A three dimensional multibody dynamic model is established, including gravity, bending moments, fluctuating mesh stiffness, nonlinear tooth contact, and <b>bearing</b> <b>clearance.</b> A flexible main shaft, planetary carrier, housing, and gear shafts are modeled using reduced degrees-of-freedom through modal compensation. This drivetrain model is validated against the experimental data of Gearbox Reliability Collaborative for gearbox internal loads. Planet load sharing is a combined effect of gravity, bending moment, <b>bearing</b> <b>clearance,</b> and input torque. Influences {{of each of}} these parameters and their combined effects on the resulting planet load sharing are investigated. Bending moments and gravity induce fundamental excitations in the rotating carrier frame, which can increase gearbox internal loads and disturb load sharing. <b>Clearance</b> in carrier <b>bearings</b> reduces the bearing load carrying capacity and thus the bending moment from the rotor can be transmitted into gear meshes. With <b>bearing</b> <b>clearance,</b> the bending moment can cause tooth micropitting and can induce planet bearing fatigue, leading to reduced gearbox life.

40|$|Abstract − In this Part II study, rotordynamic {{stability}} {{analyses were}} carried out to confirm improvements to the stability of a process high-speed lightweight centrifugal compressor, depending {{on the effects of}} tilting pad jour-nal bearing designs. The bearing design variables considered were the clearances, LBPs, LOPs, and preloads. The results showed that the rotordynamic stability of the subject compressor rotor-bearing system improves exactly in accordance with the effects of the bearing design variables, which were determined in the preceding Part I study, owing to reduced bearing stiffnesses. Specifically, it was confirmed that the stability of the rotor system can be greatly improved by increasing both the machined and assembled <b>bearing</b> <b>clearances,</b> but there were no stability improvements by simply changing from an LBP to an LOP design. In addition, it was confirmed that for given fixed machined <b>bearing</b> <b>clearances,</b> the stability can be additionally improved by decreasing the pre-loads, i. e., by increasing the assembled clearances. In conclusion, {{it may be necessary to}} improve the designs of the original tilting pad bearings to obtain a sufficient margin of rotordynamic stability against a possible aero-dynamic cross-coupled stiffness in a process high-speed centrifugal compressor. Thus, increasing the machined and assembled <b>bearing</b> <b>clearances</b> and decreasing the preload could be effective solutions...|$|R

40|$|Nonlinear {{analysis}} methods are developed which {{will enable the}} reliable prediction of the dynamic behavior {{of the space shuttle}} main engine (SSME) turbopumps in the presence of <b>bearing</b> <b>clearances</b> and other local nonlinearities. A computationally efficient convolution method, based on discretized Duhamel and transition matrix integral formulations, is developed for the transient analysis. In the formulation, the coupling forces due to the nonlinearities are treated as external forces acting on the coupled subsystems. Iteration is utilized to determine their magnitudes at each time increment. The method is applied to a nonlinear generic model of the high pressure oxygen turbopump (HPOTP). As compared to the fourth order Runge-Kutta numerical integration methods, the convolution approach proved to be more accurate and more highly efficient. For determining the nonlinear, steady-state periodic responses, an incremental harmonic balance method was also developed. The method was successfully used to determine dominantly harmonic and subharmonic responses fo the HPOTP generic model with <b>bearing</b> <b>clearances.</b> A reduction method similar to the impedance formulation utilized with linear systems is used to reduce the housing-rotor models to their coordinates at the <b>bearing</b> <b>clearances.</b> Recommendations are included for further development of the method, for extending the analysis to aperiodic and chaotic regimes and for conducting critical parameteric studies of the nonlinear response of the current SSME turbopumps...|$|R
