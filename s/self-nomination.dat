25|$|In North Africa, {{after the}} 8 November 1942 putsch by the French resistance, most Vichy figures were arrested, {{including}} General Alphonse Juin, chief commander in North Africa, and Admiral François Darlan. However, Darlan was released, and U.S. General Dwight D.

After Darlan signed an armistice with the Allies and took power in North Africa, Germany violated the 1940 armistice with France and invaded Vichy France on 10 November 1942 (operation code-named Case Anton), triggering the scuttling of the French fleet in Toulon.|$|E
25|$|Operation Torch was the American and British {{invasion}} of French North Africa, Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, started on 8 November 1942, with landings in Morocco and Algeria. The long-term {{goal was to}} clear German and Italian forces from North Africa, enhance naval control of the Mediterranean, and prepare for an {{invasion of}} Italy in 1943. The Vichy forces initially resisted, killing 479 Allied forces and wounding 720. Vichy Admiral Darlan initiated cooperation with the Allies. The Allies recognized Darlan's <b>self-nomination</b> as High Commissioner of France (head of civil government) for North and West Africa. He ordered Vichy forces there to cease resisting and cooperate with the Allies, and they did so. By the time the Tunisia Campaign was fought, the French forces in North Africa had gone over to the Allied side, joining the Free French Forces.|$|E

2500|$|In {{contrast}} with the 2007 parliamentary elections, candidates in this election could be elected on party lists or through <b>self-nomination.</b> There were 87 parties registered for the elections to compete in electoral districts. For the nationwide list the voters could choose between 22 parties. Several parties united together under [...] "umbrella" [...] parties. For example, the election list of All-Ukrainian Union [...] "Fatherland" [...] included members of Reforms and Order Party, People's Movement of Ukraine, Front of Changes, For Ukraine, People's Self-Defense, Civil Position and Social Christian Party. This electoral list {{was the result of}} negotiations within the opposition Dictatorship Resistance Committee.|$|E
2500|$|In June, 2011 the Venice Commission {{reviewed}} {{a proposed}} Draft Law {{on the election}} of Ukrainian parliamentary members. The proposal sought to re-instate a parallel voting system – used in the 1998 and 2002 elections – {{with the establishment of}} 225 local single-member districts elected (in one round) by a first-past-the-post electoral system (candidate with the highest vote total wins); and the remaining 225 parliamentary seats being elected nationwide on a proportional party-list system with a 5% support threshold; and excluding political blocs from all elections. The option [...] "Vote against all" [...] was also made defunct in the proposal (according to a November 2012 opinion poll by Research & Branding Group (otherwise) 17% of the voters would have voted [...] "against everybody" [...] during the elections). The opposition and Ukrainian analysts accused the Party of Regions of [...] "rewriting the law so that the president could secure a majority in the next Verkhovna Rada." [...] In October 2011 the Venice Commission recommended Ukraine should not return to a mixed election system. Nevertheless, on 17 November 2011 the Ukrainian Parliament approved an election law almost identical to the June 2011 proposed Draft Law. This new law satisfied the major opposition parties Batkivschyna and Front for Change; but was condemned by the core party of Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc, Our Ukraine. Candidates could be elected on party lists or through <b>self-nomination.</b> On 8 December 2011 President Viktor Yanukovych signed the new election law. Since then several parties merged with other parties.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study was to develop and assess a method for obtaining peer-, self and teacher-nominations of the {{participant}} roles in peer victimisation appropriate for use with {{children between the ages of}} five and eight years. Sixty-eight five-year-olds and 69 eight-year-olds and their teachers took part. Peer-nominations (including <b>self-nominations)</b> were obtained from five- and eight-year-olds for participant roles of aggressor, reinforcer, assistant, defender, outsider, passive and provocative victim; and similar nominations from their teachers. At both ages, children were able to nominate for all the roles, and consistent gender differences were found. Test-retest reliability (over an interval of one week) was moderate to high for all roles in eight-year-olds, but only for aggressor and provocative victim, in five-year-olds. There was evidence for role discrimination, but five-year-olds gave similar nominations for aggressor and provocative victim. Within-class pupil agreement was significant for aggressor and provocative victim at both ages, and for passive victim and defender at eight years. Peer- and teacher-ratings showed better agreement with each other than with <b>self-nominations.</b> The findings are discussed in relation to children’s developing abilities to identify and report various roles, as well as developmental changes in the nature of peer-aggression...|$|R

50|$|In 1999 Cho {{attracted}} controversy when, {{while serving}} {{as one of the}} jurors for the third annual Ignatz Awards, which are awarded to small press creators or creator-owned projects published by larger publishers, he nominated his own book Liberty Meadows. Writer Ed Brubaker, one of the original jurors and developers of the award, criticized that year's jury for their lack of support and acknowledgment of independent works, and for allowing <b>self-nomination.</b> Brubaker also questioned whether the guidelines he and Expo board member Chris Oarr had developed for the Awards were provided to that year's judges. The Comics Journal reacted to this by saying that this revealed some flaws in the Ignatz nomination system, but Cho defended his decision by explaining that few of the submissions he received as a judge were deserving of nomination, and that the Ignatz coordinator he consulted instructed him to use his own judgment, as there were no rules against <b>self-nomination.</b> Cho eventually won two Ignatz Awards that year for Outstanding Artist and Outstanding Comic, and although he did not cast the winning vote, he regrets his <b>self-nomination</b> as a mistake he would never again repeat.|$|E

30|$|Two-thirds of 2018 {{production}} {{come from}} international institutions, clearly displaying JORT’s diversity in authorship. Often, the author team {{is made up}} of academics from different countries who collaborate with a profitable synergy towards the same objective. One-quarter of our associate editors is based in countries other than Italy, as well as half of the advisors and many reviewers. Very soon, a renewal is planned in the editorial structure of the journal, to satisfy the ambitions of those who have contributed more (e.g. peer-reviewing) to JORT’s success and to allow some rest to those who have been proud defenders of JORT from the very early days of this enthusiastic editorial experience. This renewal will represent a further opportunity to increase the international diversity of the journal. JORT’s submissions previously outnumbered the referees and associate editors dedicated to each research field; at the same time, musculoskeletal research has developed in so many directions that regular updates and new designations were required. The recent history of our journal has taught us that <b>self-nominations</b> with strict requirements in terms of both proficiency and commitment allowed us to assign JORT’s key positions more wisely than third-party nominations did in the past. These features should be confirmed by high author-level scientometrics and hopefully might associate with countries of origin marked by high scientific output (USA, UK, India, China, Japan etc.), although such information cannot be considered a criterion of preference.|$|R
