5|$|The 14-story Centurion Tower was {{completed}} in 1970 {{at a cost of}} $4.2 million. In 2011 it was announced that the tower would be renovated and be renamed to Nobu, and to operate as the first Nobu Hotel with a restaurant. The concept was that the tower was to be a boutique hotel within the resort. Because the exterior was unchanged, the interior with only 181 rooms, small by Vegas standards, is more spacious with bigger rooms than the standard hotel. The motif is Asian luxury with high end amenities, including a sake bar and strict security which uses optical scanners. Each room has a sitting area, a spacious bedroom with black lacquered furniture and artworks. The bathroom contains a double-sized stall with a teak <b>shower</b> <b>stall,</b> black tiles and a large rain-style showerhead.|$|E

When the two were evicted from their apartment for storing food products in it, they decided to live at the store. Because it was zoned for commercial use, there was no <b>shower</b> <b>stall,</b> so they bathed using a water hose attached to their dishwasher.|$|E

Swedien said of Jackson recording the song, that, [...] "I tried {{all sorts of things}} with Michael – for instance, he would sing the main vocal part and we'd double it one time and then I'd ask him to step away from the mic and do it a third time and that really changed the acoustics in the room so it gave Michael's vocals a unique character … We recorded some of those background vocals in the <b>shower</b> <b>stall</b> at Westlake." ...|$|E
500|$|Mendes called American Beauty a rite {{of passage}} film about {{imprisonment}} and escape from imprisonment. The monotony of Lester's existence is established through his gray, nondescript workplace and characterless clothing. In these scenes, he is often framed as if trapped, [...] "reiterating rituals that hardly please him". He masturbates in the confines of his shower; the <b>shower</b> <b>stall</b> evokes a jail cell and the shot is the first of many where Lester is confined behind bars or within frames, such as when he is reflected behind columns of numbers on a computer monitor, [...] "confined [...] nearly crossed out". The academic and author Jody W. Pennington argues that Lester's journey is the story's center. His sexual reawakening through meeting Angela is the first of several turning points as he begins to [...] " [...] off the responsibilities of the comfortable life he has come to despise". After Lester shares a joint with Ricky, his spirit is released and he begins to rebel against Carolyn. Changed by Ricky's [...] "attractive, profound confidence", Lester is convinced that Angela is attainable and sees that he must question his [...] "banal, numbingly materialist suburban existence"; he takes a job at a fast-food outlet, which allows him to regress to a point when he could [...] "see his whole life ahead of him".|$|E

The men’s club locker room also offered amenities such as individual <b>shower</b> <b>stalls,</b> fan rooms and steam baths.
