40|$|Almost all the X-ray afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) {{observed}} by the Swift satellite have a shallow decay {{phase in the}} first thousands of seconds. We show that in an inhomogeneous jet (multiple-subjet or patchy-shell) model the superposition of the afterglows of off-axis <b>subjets</b> (patchy shells) can have the shallow decay phase. The necessary condition for obtaining the shallow decay phase is that gamma-ray bright <b>subjets</b> (patchy shells) should have gamma-ray efficiency higher than previously estimated, and should be surrounded by gamma-ray dim <b>subjets</b> (patchy shells) with low gamma-ray efficiency. Our model predicts that events with dim prompt emission have the conventional afterglow light curve without the shallow decay phase like GRB 050416 A.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a search technique that {{is sensitive to}} a broad class of signals with large final state multiplicities. Events are clustered into large radius jets and jet substructure techniques are used to {{count the number of}} <b>subjets</b> within each jet. The search consists of a cut on the total number of <b>subjets</b> in the event as well as the summed jet mass and missing energy. Two different techniques for counting <b>subjets</b> are described and expected sensitivities are presented for eight benchmark signals. These signals exhibit diverse phenomenology, including 2 -step cascade decays, direct three body decays, and multi-top final states. We find improved sensitivity to these signals as compared to previous high multiplicity searches as well as a reduced reliance on missing energy requirements. One benefit of this approach is that it allows for natural data driven estimates of the QCD background. Comment: 36 pages, 12 Figures, 5 Tables; journal versio...|$|R

50|$|The {{fourth and}} final {{movement}} returns to the sonata's home key of D minor. It is the most virtuosic of all four movements, and the frenzied, passionate character, along with the meter of 6/8, are suggestive of a tarantella. The structure {{is similar to the}} first movement, with two contrasting subjects linked together by interludes of melodic fragments and modulations. After a four-measure introduction in which the piano states the beginning of the first subject accompanied by the violin with a virtuosic series of broken chords, the two instruments switch roles and the violin states the first subject in its entirety, a lyrical but stormy, impassioned melody, accompanied in the piano by the same broken-chord figure originally seen in the violin. The second part of the first subject is a nervous, stammering series of melodic fragments, full of sharp dynamic contrasts. The piano then states, unaccompanied, the second subject in C major. This theme bears some resemblance to the second theme of last movement of his Piano Sonata No. 3 (Brahms). This is an elegant, stately and calm melody, played simply and straightforwardly. The violin then plays the melody and the piano adds some syncopated rhythms to the accompaniment, bringing back an echo of the movement's overall agitated character. Soon enough, right as the violin finishes playing the melody, the development section begins with tarantella material in the piano, played pianissimo and una corda. The violin echoes the piano, and the piece moves through several modulations. A brief restatement of the first subject then ensues, followed by a remarkable interlude: the piano plays a stripped-bare, simplified version of the first subject pianissimo in the slower tempo of the second <b>subjet,</b> accompanied by a chromatic, understated syncopated figure in the violin. It builds to a climactic restatement of the beginning of the first subject in F minor, which then leads into a virtuosic development of the tarantella-like material of the first subject. After a return to {{the second part of the}} first subject, the second subject is restated in F major, again unaccompanied in the piano, and then again taken up by the violin. As in the exposition, it leads directly into a recapitulation of the first subject material. A full-blown return to the first subject leads to a thundering conclusion in D minor.|$|E

40|$|The nuclear {{modification}} of jet splitting in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC energies is studied {{based on the}} higher twist formalism. Assuming coherent energy loss for the two splitted <b>subjets,</b> a non-monotonic jet energy dependence is found for the nuclear {{modification of}} jet splitting function: strongest modification at intermediate jet energies whereas weaker modification for larger or smaller jet energies. Combined with the smaller size and lower density of the QGP medium at RHIC than at the LHC, this explains the CMS-STAR groomed jet puzzle [...] strong nuclear modification of the momentum sharing $z_g$ distribution at the LHC whereas no obvious modification of the $z_g$ distribution at RHIC. In contrast, the observed nuclear modification pattern of the groomed jet $z_g$ distribution cannot be explained solely by independent energy loss of the two <b>subjets.</b> Our result may be tested in future measurements of groomed jets with lower jet energies at the LHC and larger jet energies at RHIC, for different angular separations between the two <b>subjets.</b> Comment: 10 pages, 12 figure...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} some of {{the first}} experimental results of the k⊥ jet algorithm at a hadron collider. Gluon jets dominate the final state of proton-antiproton (ppÂ¯) collisions at high center-of- mass energies (s = 1800 GeV). Quark jets make up a significant fraction of the jet cross section only at high jet transverse momentum pT or low s. For fixed pT, we compare jets at s = 1800 GeV to s = 630 GeV, and interpret differences in terms of differing contributions from gluon and quark jets. We define jets with a successive combination algorithm based on relative transverse momenta (k⊥). To study jet structure, the k⊥ algorithm is then applied within the jet to resolve <b>subjets.</b> We measure the number of <b>subjets</b> within mixed quark and gluon jet samples at s = 1800 and 630 GeV. A simple method is used to extract measurements of pure quark and gluon jet samples separately.

For the multiple <b>subjet</b> model in which all the subjets have the same intrinsic properties, off-axis events show Ep prop. Eiso^a with 0. 4 <a< 0. 5.

Although the scatter around the Amati correlation is large in the simulation, the results are consistent with the observed properties of GRBs with known redshifts and the BASTE GRBs with pseudo redshifts derived from the lag-luminosity correlation.

40|$|Untersuchung der Substruktur von Quarkjets und Gluonjets aus dem Z 0 -Zerfall The {{substructure}} of identified quark and gluon jets is {{studied by}} measuring the mean and the width of their <b>subjet</b> multiplicity distributions. This analysis is based on about 3 · 10 6 hadronic Z 0 decays recorded by the ALEPH detector at the LEP storage ring. From these events, approximately 72 000 nearly symmetric three-jet events are selected using the Durham algorithm with a jet resolution parameter y cut = y 1 = 0. 1. The jets are then analyzed using a smaller cut-off y 0 (y 1) so that subjets are resolved. A gluon jet is identified by requiring evidence for long-lived heavy-flavour hadrons {{in the other two}} jets of the three-jet event; this results in a sample of 4005 gluon jet candidates with a purity of 94. 4 %. By measuring the mean and the standard deviation of the <b>subjet</b> multiplicity distribution for quark and gluon jets {{as a function of the}} <b>subjet</b> resolution scale y 0, one can study the transition from hard to soft QCD. That is, one can determine the range of <b>subjet</b> scales in which perturbative predictions are reliable, and at what scale nonperturbative effects become large. These observables are also studied as a function of jet energy, opening a new degree of freedom for QCD tests. When comparing quark and gluon jets one can see that within a certain range of jet energy the mean <b>subjet</b> multiplicities differ by up to a factor of about 3 and the standard deviations differ by up to a factor of about 2. All the measured quantities are compared with the predictions of Monte Carlo models and perturbative QCD calculations, which are now available for quark and gluon jets separately. The latter comparison shows that leading and next-to-leading logarithmic contributions are necessary to extend perturbative descriptions down to lower momentum-transfers.
