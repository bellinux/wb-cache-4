5|$|Following Spies' speech, {{the crowd}} was {{addressed}} by Parsons, the Alabama-born editor of the radical English-language weekly The Alarm. The crowd was <b>so</b> <b>calm</b> that Mayor Carter Harrison Sr., who had stopped by to watch, walked home early. Parsons spoke {{for almost an hour}} before standing down in favor of the last speaker of the evening, the British socialist Samuel Fielden, who delivered a brief ten-minute address. Many of the crowd had already left as the weather was deteriorating.|$|E
5|$|My dearest Hogg my baby is dead—will {{you come}} to see me as soon as you can. I wish to see you—It was {{perfectly}} well when I went to bed—I awoke in the night to give it suck it appeared to be sleeping so quietly that I would not awake it. It was dead then, but we did not find that out till morning—from its appearance it evidently died of convulsions—Will you come—you are <b>so</b> <b>calm</b> a creature & Shelley is afraid of a fever from the milk—for I am no longer a mother now.|$|E
25|$|Practise meditation, and {{by and by}} {{your mind}} will be <b>so</b> <b>calm</b> and fixed that you will {{find it hard to}} keep away from meditation.|$|E
60|$|All this {{business}} with details <b>so</b> <b>calmed</b> {{him that he}} wondered if he really cared to see her at all. Besides, it was so late--after half-past eight.|$|R
60|$|Jack now {{deemed it}} prudent {{to bring the}} scene to a close, <b>so,</b> <b>calming</b> himself {{as well as he}} could, he took a steady aim, and, {{watching}} his opportunity, fired.|$|R
6000|$|... "As well {{might you}} seek {{to restore the}} breath to a dead man," [...] she answered, and her voice was <b>so</b> oddly <b>calm,</b> <b>so</b> cold and bare of expression, that Gregory shuddered to hear it.|$|R
500|$|Although {{the air was}} clear, {{there was}} no moon, and with the sea <b>so</b> <b>calm,</b> {{there was nothing to}} give away the {{position}} of the nearby icebergs; had the sea been rougher, waves breaking against the icebergs would have made them more visible. Because of a mix-up at Southampton the lookouts had no binoculars; but reportedly binoculars would not have been effective in darkness which was total except for starlight and the ship's own lights. The lookouts were nonetheless well aware of the ice hazard, as Lightoller had ordered them and other crew members to [...] "keep a sharp look-out for ice, particularly small ice and growlers".|$|E
500|$|American Pharoah's gentle {{demeanor}} is also distinctive, {{in that he}} is fond {{of people}} and, particularly for a young racehorse, surprisingly calm around them. As Baffert explained, [...] "Horses of his caliber are not that nice and sweet. They're just sort of tough. If I brought Bayern out here, you can't get near him, he's too aggressive. 's just so different than any horse I've ever had." [...] He was not always <b>so</b> <b>calm,</b> described initially as [...] "a {{little bit of a}} headcase," [...] but Baffert explained that after his anxiety-ridden first race, people worked with him, schooling him in the track paddock for about two weeks, when [...] "all the sudden he got really sweet and really mellow." ...|$|E
2500|$|Police detectives {{later said}} it {{appeared}} Ferguson {{had been planning}} the shooting {{for more than a}} week. Chief Joseph Flynn of the Long Island Rail Road police said, [...] "This was the work of a deranged, maniacal person who {{for a variety of reasons}} decided to explode." [...] None of Ferguson's victims were black, although it was unclear whether any other black passengers were aboard the train. Ferguson showed no emotion as he sat in the back of a police car, which some passengers said was as shocking and disturbing as the violence of the shooting itself. Upon seeing Ferguson, one of the victims became hysterical and shouted, [...] "How can he be sitting there <b>so</b> <b>calm</b> after everything he did?" ...|$|E
60|$|This {{was a great}} trial, but {{he would}} not allow her to sit up; and her own sense showed her that if this was to be a long illness, it would not do to waste her strength. She knew he was quiet at night, and her trustful temper <b>so</b> <b>calmed</b> and {{supported}} her, {{that she was able to}} sleep, and thus was not as liable to be overworked as might have been feared, and as Philip thought she must be.|$|R
60|$|Such was our life. <b>So</b> in <b>calm</b> {{and peace}} (for we had secured a Tory chuckerouto from Birmingham) passed the even tenor of out days.|$|R
60|$|She was dead. No sleep <b>so</b> {{beautiful}} and <b>calm,</b> <b>so</b> free from trace of pain, so fair to look upon. She seemed a creature {{fresh from the}} hand of God, {{and waiting for the}} breath of life; not one who had lived and suffered death.|$|R
2500|$|On {{the second}} play of this {{potential}} game-winning drive, Dallas committed a 15-yard holding penalty (its second offensive holding of the game) on the 42-yard line, {{which was a}} spot foul, pushing the team {{all the way back}} to its own 27-yard line (the NFL did not reduce the penalty for offensive holding to 10 yards until 1974). Then, on second down and 35, Morton threw a pass that slipped through the hands of running back Dan Reeves and bounced for an interception into the arms of linebacker Mike Curtis, who then returned the ball 13 yards to the Cowboys' 28-yard line. Two plays later, O'Brien kicked the go ahead 32-yard field goal, giving Baltimore a 16–13 lead with five seconds left in the game. O'Brien says he was [...] "on automatic" [...] and was <b>so</b> <b>calm</b> and concentrating so hard that he didn't hear anything and saw only the ball. In an enduring image from Super Bowl V, after O'Brien's game-winning field goal Bob Lilly took off his helmet and hurled it through the air in disgust.|$|E
2500|$|The 79th {{running of}} the Tokyo Yushun took place over 2400 metres on firm ground at Tokyo on 27 May. World Ace headed the betting from Gold Ship with Deep Brillante third choice on 7.5/1. The other runners {{included}} Grandezza, Just A Way, Alfredo, Fenomeno and Historical (Mainichi Hai Stakes). In the build-up to the race the colt's groom had praised his attitude and temperament saying [...] "He's <b>so</b> <b>calm</b> usually it's almost frightening. He doesn't need any babysitting whatsoever. He's an intelligent horse, and he always runs his heart out in races". After tracking the leaders Iwata sent the colt into third approaching the final turn before taking the lead 200 metres out. In an extremely tight finish Deep Brillante held on to win by a nose from Fenomeno, with Tosen Homareboshi, World Ace, Gold Ship and Cosmo Ozora close behind. Less than two lengths covered the first six finishers. After the race Iwata, who was winning {{the race for the}} first time, said [...] "Praise him not me. It was his guts that won it as he was completely empty at the finish. I have always thought he was the best horse in this generation so we trained him very hard to get a big success. We thought he was the best one and I am proud that we could prove it." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 22 May 1916, it was {{discovered}} that Seydlitz was still not watertight after repairs and would not now be ready until the 29th. The ambush submarines were now on station and experiencing difficulties of their own: visibility near the coast was frequently poor due to fog, and sea conditions were either <b>so</b> <b>calm</b> the slightest ripple, as from the periscope, could give away their position, or so rough as to make it very hard to keep the vessel at a steady depth. The British had become aware of unusual submarine activity, and had begun counter patrols that forced the submarines out of position. UB-27 passed Bell Rock on the night of 23 May on its way into the Firth of Forth as planned, but was halted by engine trouble. After repairs it continued to approach, following behind merchant vessels, and reached Largo Bay on 25 May. There the boat became entangled in nets that fouled one of the propellers, forcing it to abandon the operation and return home. U-74 was detected by four armed trawlers on 27 May and sunk [...] south-east of Peterhead. U-75 laid its mines off the Orkney Islands, which, although they played no part in the battle, were responsible later for sinking the cruiser [...] carrying Lord Kitchener (head of the army) on a mission to Russia on 5 June. U-72 was forced to abandon its mission without laying any mines when an oil leak meant it was leaving a visible surface trail astern.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept was}} also {{brought about by}} the lyrics, which are about sneaking out in the night and getting up to no good without your parents knowing. The idea of her {{crawling}} through her bed into this other world made it fantastical and have creative licence to have a few surreal elements. The bed scene was made up of thirty or so mattresses inside a tent of giant silk. The light was amazing, and once inside the bed set it felt <b>so</b> <b>calming</b> and peaceful. This serenity really reflects Pixie's performance in this section.|$|R
60|$|The judge looked sternly at Sam {{for full}} two minutes, but Sam's {{features}} were <b>so</b> perfectly <b>calm</b> and serene {{that the judge}} said nothing, and motioned Serjeant Buzfuz to proceed.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are so different, <b>so</b> dreadfully <b>calm.</b> You frighten me. I {{feel you}} have {{something}} terrible planned all the while. But whatever you do, don't do anything rash. Don't get excited--" ...|$|R
60|$|She was <b>so</b> <b>calm!</b> and I was so {{far from}} it, so nearly frantic.|$|E
60|$|When {{you came}} to-night, <b>so</b> <b>calm</b> and self-possessed, I admired you as I'd never admired you before.|$|E
60|$|He seemed, {{almost to}} himself, {{to be playing}} a part, he was <b>so</b> <b>calm</b> yet so {{gracefully}} happy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Slay me, Harmachis!" [...] she moaned; [...] "slay me, or I slay myself! My {{burden is}} too great for me to bear! Be not <b>so</b> deadly <b>calm!</b> Curse me, and slay!" ...|$|R
60|$|Eve turned quickly, {{and looked}} towards her kinsman. He was {{standing}} near the table, with folded arms, and his fine face expressing all the sarcasm and contempt that a countenance <b>so</b> singularly <b>calm</b> and gentleman-like, could betray.|$|R
60|$|Small wonder. The vessel {{does not}} exist that can be steered in <b>so</b> {{absolute}} a <b>calm.</b>|$|R
60|$|Feversham, however, chanced {{to observe}} that this man who had shown himself {{hitherto}} <b>so</b> <b>calm</b> looked suddenly most singularly perturbed.|$|E
60|$|Eric {{rose and}} lighted the lamp, rather {{wondering}} at Mrs. Williamson's unusual exhibition of nerves. She was generally <b>so</b> <b>calm</b> and composed.|$|E
6000|$|BERNARDO: Look not <b>so</b> <b>calm</b> and happy, or even whilst [...] 15 I stand {{considering}} what I {{have to say}} My heart will break.|$|E
60|$|Six bells {{were struck}} on deck. Eleven! He drank {{a glass of}} water, and sat down for ten minutes or <b>so</b> to <b>calm</b> himself. Then {{he got out of}} his chest a small bull's-eye lantern of his own and lit it.|$|R
60|$|Ole having {{filled the}} pipe, lighted it; then, {{leaning over the}} taffrail, he gazed placidly into the dark waters, which were <b>so</b> {{perfectly}} <b>calm</b> that every star in the vault above could be compared with its reflection in the abyss below.|$|R
60|$|The {{voice was}} low, but yet <b>so</b> clear and <b>calm,</b> that every {{syllable}} rang through Aben-Ezra's tingling ears....|$|R
6000|$|The {{stars were}} very big and bright, <b>so</b> <b>calm,</b> so cold, that it somehow hurt {{me to look}} at them. Not like men's lives, surely! ...|$|E
60|$|I {{fear that}} if he comes Otto might kill him. Otto is <b>so</b> <b>calm,</b> I dread {{to think of what}} would happen if he were aroused.|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>calm</b> {{and firm}} {{and full of}} {{assurance}} was his tone, so unquestionable his right to command them, that the men sprang instantly to obey him.|$|E
60|$|In a {{short time}} the boat {{was close to the}} beacon, and the water was <b>so</b> very <b>calm</b> that day, {{that they were able to}} venture to hand the packet of letters with which they had come off into the beacon, even {{although}} the tide was full.|$|R
60|$|The doctor {{gripped the}} sides of his chair and stared at this man who {{discussed}} a matter <b>so</b> terrible with <b>calm</b> and perfect ease.|$|R
60|$|Seb. The tempest is o'erblown, {{the skies}} are clear, And the sea charmed into a <b>calm</b> <b>so</b> still, That not a wrinkle ruffles her smooth face.|$|R
