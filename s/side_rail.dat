5|$|When built, the {{surrounding}} area was composed of dirt roads and private residences. The Southern Pacific Railroad's 1868 west <b>side</b> <b>rail</b> line ran down Fourth Avenue past City Hall and the county courthouse. The city and county governments fought the railroad to remove the dirty and noisy steam locomotives from this route, succeeding in 1912. Southern Pacific's electric interurban line continued on the tracks until the 1930s. In 2007, work began on adding light rail tracks on Fifth Avenue for the planned MAX Green Line, and trains once again ran past City Hall starting in 2009.|$|E

40|$|This article {{explores the}} use of <b>side</b> <b>rails</b> {{within the context of}} {{physical}} restraint in gerontological practice. It is debated that <b>side</b> <b>rails</b> can be considered as a form of physical restraint if the individual cannot voluntarily remove/lower the device if he/she wishes to do so. The value of <b>side</b> <b>rails</b> as a protective medium is debated with regard to their association with injuries sustained as a result. <b>Side</b> <b>rails</b> should be used with caution and within a risk management context. Frailty should not be an indicator for {{the use of}} <b>side</b> <b>rails,</b> an individualized approach to determine patient's suitability to <b>side</b> <b>rails</b> is advocated...|$|R
40|$|To {{explore the}} safety of the {{standard}} and the low hospital bed, we report on a microanalysis of 15 patients’ ability to ingress, move about the bed, and egress. The 15 participants were purposefully selected with various disabilities. Bed conditions were randomized with <b>side</b> <b>rails</b> up or down and one low bed with <b>side</b> <b>rails</b> down. We explored the patients’ use of the <b>side</b> <b>rails,</b> bed height, ability to lift their legs onto the mattress, and ability to turn, egress, and walk back to the chair. The standard bed was too high for some participants, both for ingress and egress. <b>Side</b> <b>rails</b> were used by most participants when entering, turning in bed, and exiting. We recommend that <b>side</b> <b>rails</b> be reconsidered as a means to facilitate in-bed movement, ingress, and egress. Furthermore, single deck height settings for all patients are not optimal. Low beds as a safety measure must be re-evaluated...|$|R
40|$|Light-weight {{surgical}} robots {{like the}} DLR MIRO can be {{mounted on the}} <b>side</b> <b>rails</b> of the surgical table. Using this normed mechanical interface reduces the introduction costs and enhances the flexibility of robotic systems in surgery. Lifting the robot arms manually on the <b>side</b> <b>rails</b> and fixate them there, however, is arduous for the OR staff and bears the risk of accidentally dropping the robot. The DLR MIDAS is a manually driven transport and docking device for up to four MIRO robot arms. Its design guarantees a safe transfer of the robot arms from the transport cart to the <b>side</b> <b>rails</b> of the surgical table and vice versa: During the whole docking procedure the robot {{is connected to the}} cart or to the <b>side</b> <b>rails...</b>|$|R
25|$|The current Penn Station is {{completely}} underground, and sits below Madison Square Garden, 33rd Street, and Two Penn Plaza. The station has three underground levels: concourses {{on the upper}} two levels and train platforms on the lowest. The two levels of concourses, while original to the 1910 station, were extensively renovated during the construction of Madison Square Garden, and expanded in subsequent decades. The tracks and platforms are also largely original, except for some work connecting the station to the West <b>Side</b> <b>Rail</b> Yard and the Amtrak Empire Corridor serving Albany and Buffalo, New York.|$|E

2500|$|By the 1960s the Grace Memorial Bridge {{had become}} insufficient, with its two narrow 10-foot (3 m) lanes built for Ford Model As and its steep grades {{of up to}} 6 percent. Later changes to the <b>side</b> <b>rail</b> and curb reduced the lane width further. A new bridge was {{constructed}} alongside and parallel to it. Named for the then-South Carolina Highway Commissioner, the Silas N. Pearman Bridge opened in 1966 at cost of $15 million. Its three lanes, at a modern 12-foot (3.7 m) width, opened to northbound traffic while its older counterpart carried the southbound traffic into downtown Charleston. One lane was reversible on the Pearman bridge, which led to signs warning [...] "Use lanes with green arrow" [...] and [...] "Do not use red X lane" [...] on the bridge.|$|E

6000|$|I looked round {{for some}} weapon. Nothing. Then with an {{inspiration}} I {{turned over the}} deck chair, put my foot {{on the side of}} it, and tore away the <b>side</b> <b>rail.</b> It happened that a nail came away with the wood, and projecting, gave a touch of danger to an otherwise petty weapon. I heard a step outside, and incontinently flung open the door and found Montgomery within a yard of it. He meant to lock the outer door!

60|$|While the Indian {{went to get}} cedar bark, etc., {{to carry}} his canoe with, we cooked the dinner on the shore {{in the midst of}} a {{sprinkling}} rain. He prepared his canoe for carrying in this wise. He took a cedar shingle or splint eighteen inches long and four or five wide, rounded at one end, that the corners might not be in the way, and tied it with cedar bark by two holes made midway, near the edge on each side, to the middle crossbar of the canoe. When the canoe was lifted upon his head bottom up, this shingle, with its rounded end uppermost, distributed the weight over his shoulders and head, while a band of cedar bark, tied to the crossbar on each side of the shingle, passed round his breast, and another longer one, outside of the last, round his forehead; also a hand on each <b>side</b> <b>rail</b> served to steer the canoe and keep it from rocking. He thus carried it with his shoulders, head, breast, forehead, and both hands, as if the upper part of his body were all one hand to clasp and hold it. A cedar tree furnished all the gear in this case, as it had the woodwork of the canoe. One of the paddles rested on the crossbars in the bows. I took the canoe upon my head and found that I could carry it with ease, but I let him carry it, not caring to establish a different precedent. This shingle remained tied to the crossbar throughout the voyage, was always ready for the carries, and also served to protect the back of one passenger.|$|E
