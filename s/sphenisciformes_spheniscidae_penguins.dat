50|$|<b>Penguins</b> (order <b>Sphenisciformes,</b> family <b>Spheniscidae)</b> are a {{group of}} aquatic, flightless birds. They live almost {{exclusively}} in the Southern Hemisphere, with only one species, the Galapagos penguin, found north of the equator. Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage, and their wings have evolved into flippers. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid {{and other forms of}} sealife caught while swimming underwater. They spend about half of their lives on land and half in the oceans.|$|R
50|$|Bird {{migration}} {{is not limited}} to birds that can fly. Most species of <b>penguin</b> (<b>Spheniscidae)</b> migrate by swimming. These routes can cover over 1000 km. Dusky grouse Dendragapus obscurus perform altitudinal migration mostly by walking. Emus Dromaius novaehollandiae in Australia have been observed to undertake long-distance movements on foot during droughts.|$|R
40|$|Seabirds {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{threatened}} groups of birds globally and, overall, their conservation status is deteriorating rapidly. Southern hemisphere countries are over-represented in the number of species of conservation concern yet long-term phenological data on seabirds in the southern hemisphere is limited. A better understanding of the implications of changes in the marine and terrestrial environments to seabird species is required in order to improve their management and conservation status. Here we conducted a meta-analysis of the phenological drivers and trends among southern hemisphere seabirds. Overall there was a general trend towards later phenological events over time (34 % of all data series, N = 47; 67 % of all significant trends), though this varied by taxa and location. The strongest trends towards later events were for seabirds breeding in Australia, the Laridae (gulls, noddies, terns) and migratory southern polar seabirds. In contrast, earlier phenologies were more often observed for the <b>Spheniscidae</b> (<b>penguins)</b> and for other seabirds breeding in the Antarctic and subantarctic. Phenological changes were most often associated with changes in oceanographic conditions, with sea-ice playing an important role for more southerly species. For some species in some locations, such as the Little Penguin Eudyptula minor in south-eastern Australia, warmer oceans projected under various climate change scenarios are expected to correspond to increased seabird productivity, manifested through earlier breeding, heavier chicks, an increased chance of double brooding, at least in the short-term...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Nutrition and {{predation}} {{have been}} considered two primary agents of selection important {{in the evolution of}} avian life history traits. The relative importance of these natural selective forces in the evolution of avian embryonic developmental period (EDP) remain poorly resolved, perhaps in part because research has tended to focus on a single, high taxonomic-level group of birds: Order Passeriformes. The marine bird families Alcidae (auks) and <b>Spheniscidae</b> (<b>penguins)</b> exhibit marked variation in EDP, as well as behavioural and ecological traits ultimately linked to EDP. Therefore, auks and penguins provide a unique opportunity to assess the natural selective basis of variation in a key life-history trait at a low taxonomic-level. We used phylogenetic comparative methods to investigate the relative importance of behavioural and ecological factors related to nutrition and predation in the evolution of avian EDP. Results Three behavioural and ecological variables related to nutrition and predation risk (i. e., clutch size, activity pattern, and nesting habits) were significant predictors of residual variation in auk and penguin EDP based on models predicting EDP from egg mass. Species with larger clutch sizes, diurnal activity patterns, and open nests had significantly shorter EDPs. Further, EDP was found to be longer among birds which forage in distant offshore waters, relative to those that foraged in near shore waters, in line with our predictions, but not significantly so. Conclusion Current debate has emphasized predation as the primary agent of selection driving avian life history diversification. Our results suggest that both nutrition and predation have been important selective forces in the evolution of auk and penguin EDP, and highlight the importance of considering these questions at lower taxonomic scales. We suggest that further comparative studies on lower taxonomic-level groups will continue to constructively inform the debate on evolutionary determinants of avian EDP, as well as other life history parameters. </p...|$|R

40|$|Analysis of {{nucleotide}} sequence variation at a microsatellite DNA locus revealed extensive size homoplasy of alleles in Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae). Variation in the flanking regions at this locus allowed discrimination between mechanisms proposed for length changes in microsatellite DNA alleles. We further examined {{the structure of}} alleles for the same microsatellite DNA locus across 11 additional species of <b>penguin</b> (<b>Spheniscidae)</b> by mapping allele sequen-ces onto an independent penguin phylogeny. Our analysis indicated that the repeat motifs appear to have evolved independently on several occasions. We observed sequence instability in the region bordering the repeat tract with a transversional bias predominating. We propose that this bias results from inaccurate DNA replication owing to the sequence context of this repeat tract. Because we show that regions flanking repeat sequences exhibit this mutational bias, this cautions {{against the use of}} such regions for phylogeny reconstruction...|$|R
40|$|<b>Penguins</b> (<b>Spheniscidae)</b> {{represent}} a monophyletic group comprised of 17 species (Stonehouse 1975; Williams 1995). Found {{exclusively in the}} Southern Hemisphere, these flightless diving birds occupy {{a wide range of}} habitats from Antarctica to the Galápagos Islands (Williams 1995). Currently, ten species are listed on IUCN’s Red List (BirdLife International 2000) as either ‘endangered’ or ‘vulnerable’. Genetic markers would be useful for resolving issues relevant to the conservation of this group. The entire Adélie penguin mitochondrial (mt) DNA control region has been reported (Ritchie and Lambert 2000) but to date, no general spheniscid PCR-primers that target this useful hypervariable sequence exist. Here we report four novel polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers designed for the mtDNA control region that amplify across a broad range of penguin species. In addition, we show cross-amplification of nuclear microsatellite loci isolated from Adélie penguins in other penguin species.

40|$|We {{identified}} and compared gross and microscopic lesions {{associated with the}} cestode, Parorchites zederi, in the digestive tracts of three species of <b>penguins</b> (<b>Spheniscidae)</b> : the Chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarctica), Gentoo (Pygoscelis papua), and Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae). The gastrointestinal tracts of 79 recently dead individuals (71 chicks and eight adults) were collected in locations throughout the Antarctic Peninsula during summer field trips in 2006 – 09. Parorchites zederi {{was found in the}} small intestine of 37 animals (47 %), and 23 (62 %) of these had parasite-associated lesions. The cestodes were either free in the intestinal lumen, clustered within mucosal ulcers, or deeply embedded in the intestinal wall. Histopathologic changes were most severe in adult Gentoo Penguins and included transmural fibrogranulomatous enteritis, hemorrhage, and edema. This report of pathology associated with P. zederi in the digestive tracts of penguins can serve as reference to monitor health in Antarctic birds associated with environmental changes.

40|$|The plotopterids (Aves, Plotopteridae) were a {{group of}} extinct wing-propelled marine birds that are known from Paleogeneaged sediments (Eocene to Miocene), mostly around the Pacific Rim (especially Japan and the {{northwest}} coast of North America). While these birds exhibit a strikingly similar wing morphology to <b>penguins</b> (<b>Spheniscidae),</b> they also share derived characters with pelecaniform birds that are absent in penguins and exhibit apparently superficial similarities with auks (Alcidae: Charadriiformes). Despite quite an abundant fossil record, these birds have been little studied, and in particular their functional morphology remains little understood. Here we present osteological overviews of specimens from the northwest coast of Washington state (USA). We give an amended diagnosis for the well-represented North American genus, Tonsala Olson, 1980, describe a new large species, and examine the functional morphology of plotopterids showing that the ratio of humeral strength to femoral strength is quite low in one well-represented species Tonsala buchanani sp. nov., relative to both extant penguins and alcids. While the femoral strength of Tonsala buchanani is ‘penguin-grade’, its humeral strength is more ‘alcid-grade’. These results have implications for understanding the mode-of-locomotion of these extinct marine birds. Although not related to Spheniscidae, our descriptions and functional results suggest that Tonsala buchanani sustained similar loads in walking, but slightly lower humeral loads during swimming, than a modern penguin. This suggests a swimming mode that is more similar to living alcids, than to the highly-specialised locomotor strategy of living and fossi...|$|R
40|$|When {{monitoring}} {{species with}} extensive ranges in harsh climates, comprehensive studies across a species' range are both logistically and technically challenging and therefore rare. Such scarcity in data collection {{is particularly true}} in the polar regions where sea ice and weather constraints prevent widespread access to sites {{for much of the}} year, specifically during winter. <b>Penguins</b> (<b>Spheniscidae)</b> show large variations in winter strategies with many species migrating long distances while others are distinctly sedentary, remaining at the colony year-round. However, in some species, their attendance at the breeding site during the nonbreeding winter period depends greatly on the colony location and environmental factors. Here we aim to examine fluctuations in winter attendance at the breeding site in Gentoo Penguins (Pygoscelis papua) along a latitudinal gradient of 7 sites, ranging from Martillo Island, a colony in Argentina, to Petermann Island, a colony located toward the southern edge of the species' range on the Western Antarctic Peninsula. We use an established network of cameras to observe winter populations of penguins across a large latitudinal gradient. This study provides the first evidence of across-year variation in Gentoo Penguin nonbreeding attendance at the breeding site. We found that both temporal and spatial factors drive winter attendance in this species with distinct patterns between years and colony locations, particularly at the edges of its range. Additionally, environmental and temporal factors, including sea ice extent directly offshore and photoperiod, appear to dictate Gentoo Penguin winter attendance across their range. As Gentoo Penguins are neither sedentary nor migratory during the nonbreeding period, understanding patterns in winter site occupation across time and space provides insight into half of the species' annual cycle and has important implications in the face of changes in climate, direct human disturbance, and fisheries activities...|$|R
40|$|International audience: Cumulative human impacts {{across the}} world's oceans are considerable. We {{therefore}} examined a single model taxonomic group, the <b>penguins</b> (<b>Spheniscidae),</b> {{to explore how}} marine species and communities might be at risk of decline or extinction in the southern hemisphere. We sought to determine the most important threats to penguins and to suggest means to mitigate these threats. Our review has relevance to other taxonomic groups in the southern hemisphere and in northern latitudes, where human impacts are greater. Our review {{was based on an}} expert assessment and literature review of all 18 penguin species; 49 scientists contributed to the process. For each penguin species, we considered their range and distribution, population trends, and main anthropogenic threats over the past approximately 250 years. These threats were harvesting adults for oil, skin, and feathers and as bait for crab and rock lobster fisheries; harvesting of eggs; terrestrial habitat degradation; marine pollution; fisheries bycatch and resource competition; environmental variability and climate change; and toxic algal poisoning and disease. Habitat loss, pollution, and fishing, all factors humans can readily mitigate, remain the primary threats for penguin species. Their future resilience to further climate change impacts will almost certainly depend on addressing current threats to existing habitat degradation on land and at sea. We suggest protection of breeding habitat, linked to the designation of appropriately scaled marine reserves, including in the High Seas, will be critical for the future conservation of penguins. However, large-scale conservation zones are not always practical or politically feasible and other ecosystem-based management methods that include spatial zoning, bycatch mitigation, and robust harvest control must be developed to maintain marine biodiversity and ensure that ecosystem functioning is maintained across a variety of scales.

40|$|Microsatellites {{are widely}} used as genetic markers for {{examining}} a variety of biological questions. Despite their widespread use, {{little is known about}} the processes by which they evolve. An accurate understanding of these processes is essential for their correct use as population genetic markers. In this study, microsatellite loci from both living and cryopreserved (AMS 14 C dated at up to 6424 years BP ± 80) Antarctic Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) were examined in order to gain insights into temporal population genetics and the evolution of microsatellite loci. Firstly, ancient DNA extracted from Adélie penguin subfossil bones was found to be extremely well-preserved and readily allowed the amplification of single-copy nuclear microsatellite DNA. Genotyping six microsatellite loci in ancient and living samples from three populations of Adélie penguins in the Terra Nova Bay region allowed a comparison of genetic change over time. Although the ancient sample sizes were limiting, several statistical tests indicated that the ancient and living populations from Inexpressible Island were genetically distinct. In addition, differentiation was also inferred between the three ancient populations that were examined, which is in contrast to the lack of differentiation found between the living populations. These genetic changes may be a result of population expansion out of ice-age refugia since the Last Glacial Maximum. To study microsatellite evolution over a substantial time period, up to 500 living and 100 cryopreserved Adélie penguins were genotyped at six microsatellite loci. No novel electromorph alleles were detected in the ancient samples. Numerous alleles were sequenced from four of these loci in both Adélie penguins and several other species of <b>penguin</b> (<b>Spheniscidae).</b> Analysis of these sequences provided an insight into the mutational processes occurring at these loci. In particular, these allele sequences revealed extensive size homoplasy, both within Adélie penguins and between penguin species. At one locus, variation in the flanking region allowed discrimination between the mechanisms proposed for length change at microsatellite loci. Slippage was the most plausible mechanism for length change. In this same locus, instability was observed in the region bordering the repeat tract with a transversional bias predominating. This bias may be a caused by inaccurate DNA replication resulting from structural features of DNA...|$|R
