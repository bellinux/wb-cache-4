5|$|In Iberia, {{the western}} Mediterranean and {{northwest}} Africa, the common starling may {{be confused with}} the closely related spotless starling, the plumage of which, as its name implies, has a more uniform colour. At close range it can be <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> latter has longer throat feathers, a fact particularly noticeable when it sings.|$|E
5|$|By 14 August Ohio {{was stopped}} with {{no hope of}} getting her engines going {{as she had been}} hit again whilst in tow of Penn. As Ledbury {{approached}} the estimated position of the tanker, the destroyer could find no sign of her. A little later, Commander Hill sighted gunfire ahead, and considering it to be Ohios escorts beating off reconnaissance snoops, the destroyer turned course towards the flashes on the horizon. As Ledbury approached Ohio, it was <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tanker was lying deep in the water, with a bent line of deck. Here, Hill turned towards his number one and said ' It looks as though we're too late '.|$|E
30|$|In Figures 1 - 3, we <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> smaller ε and α, {{the better}} the regularized {{solution}} is. Moreover, we <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> a posteriori parameter choice also works well.|$|R
30|$|In Figure  4 and Figure  5, we <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{numerical}} {{results are}} in good agreement with the exact shape. We <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> smaller ε, the better the computed approximation is.|$|R
50|$|For the Inverse we can <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Proximate is {{reflected}} inversely through the Object {{and then through}} the Patient, then we can <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Obviative {{is reflected}} through the Subject and then through the Agent.|$|R
5|$|Catherine Martell (Piper Laurie) {{learns that}} a new life {{insurance}} policy has been taken out in her name, by Josie Packard (Joan Chen) and Benjamin Horne (Richard Beymer). Martell had been planning with Horne to burn down Packard's sawmill in order to cheaply purchase the land it occupies. Packard speaks to Horne over the telephone, cooperating with the sawmill arson, but arranging to burn it down with Martell inside. As Packard hangs up, it is <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> recently paroled killer Hank Jennings (Chris Mulkey) has been beside her.|$|E
5|$|The {{destruction}} of the Tuileries Palace affected the aesthetic relationship between the Palais du Louvre and the Arc de Triomphe, as it could now be <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two structures {{were not on the}} same axis. The Palais des Tuileries had served to disguise the fact that the Palais du Louvre is skewed slightly (6.33°) relative to the Axe historique (also known as the Voie Triomphale), a seven-kilometre straight line of structures and thoroughfares, including the Place de la Concorde, Champs-Élysées, the Arc de Triomphe and the Grande Arche de La Défense.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} case of orbital {{resonance}} in exoplanets {{has been noted}} between Kepler-9b and Kepler-9c. The two planets, whose orbits correspond in a roughly 1:2 ratio, maintain the orbit of the other by gravitational tug. Kepler-9b's orbit grows, on average, four minutes longer every orbital period. Eventually, this trend will reverse and increase. Over time, it can be <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> planets' orbits oscillate slightly {{above and below the}} 1:2 ratio. Alycia Weinberger of the Carnegie Institution has stated that the Kepler-9 gas giants probably formed further away from the star than they are, and the appearance of the orbital resonance phenomenon may help explain the history of their inward migration.|$|E
30|$|Just set the {{transformation}} function as t(x)= 1 −x. It {{is easy to}} <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> resulting distances in the walk-through example are symmetric and reflexive. Furthermore, we can <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> distances (0.4472, 0.8944, 1) conform to the triangle inequality property. So, t∘s is a distance function.|$|R
30|$|According to Table  1, we {{can easily}} <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{standard}} deviations of the estimators θ̂_n and θ̌_n are small.

25|$|It can {{be easily}} <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> only {{possible}} degree of a triangle from T is 0, 1, or 2, and that the degree 1 corresponds to a triangle colored with the three colors 1, 2, and 3.|$|E
25|$|A glide {{reflection}} is {{the composition}} of a reflection across a line followed by a translation {{in the direction of}} that line. It can be <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> order of these operations does not matter (the translation can come first, followed by the reflection).|$|E
