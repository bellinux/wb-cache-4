40|$|Purpose The {{development}} and implementation of a pharmacist-managed outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) program in a county teaching hospital are described. Summary A pharmacist-managed OPAT program was developed and implemented at a county teaching hospital to provide consistent evaluation, approval, and monitoring of patients requiring OPAT for the treatment of infection. The developmental and implementation stages of the OPAT program included (1) a needs assessment, (2) the identification of resources necessary for program operation, (3) delineation of general OPAT program operations and activities of individual OPAT clinicians, (4) the development of patient selection criteria, including a plan of care algorithm, and (5) acquisition of administrative support to approve the program. In this program, the OPAT pharmacist plays an integral role in the management and oversight of OPAT patients, working under a collaborative agreement with infectious diseases physicians. The OPAT pharmacist assists with appropriate patient and regimen <b>selection,</b> <b>confirmation</b> of orders on discharge, assuring that laboratory tests for safety surveillance are performed and evaluated, performing routine monitoring for adverse events and line complications, and assuring the removal of the vascular access device upon the completion of OPAT. Conclusion: The OPAT program provides structured monitoring, patient follow-up, and led to improvements in patient outcome with minimization of treatment and line-related adverse events...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} few years there has been a move towards {{assessing}} and appraising the quality of teaching in Australian universities. While some law schools have on their own initiative paid more attention to this process, in others the issue has arisen {{in the context of the}} move towards staff assessment and appraisal which developed out of the second tier National Wage negotiations in the tertiary education sector in 1988. Until these developments, there had been little or no attempt to scrutinise teaching within law schools. It has been commonly accepted that where teaching has been scrutinised for the purposes of promotion, confirmation and recruitment, scrutiny was often based on rumour, innuendo and hearsay. In this context, then, the move towards more rigorous scrutiny of teaching in law schools should be welcome. Of course, there are arguments for and against more rigorous scrutiny of teaching. Why should teaching be ignored or paid lipservice in <b>selection,</b> <b>confirmation</b> and promotion when it is an important and time consuming component of the work of academics in law schools? If teaching is important, it should be taken seriously in recruitment and promotion. This means scrutinising it carefully and fairly. If, as seems likely, academics working in law schools in the 1990 s will become much more accountable for their teaching, we had better get used to the idea of teaching being more rigorously scrutinised. This, however, raises a problem of vertical equity. Why should today’s new teachers have their teaching rigorously examined when in the past teaching was largely ignored and, where it was scrutinised, this was done in a far less rigorous fashion than the assessment of research? It is often argued that scrutinisation of teaching is difficult to do, and therefore should not be attempted. It is this last point that this article seeks partly to address. More particularly, this article examines why and how teaching should be scrutinised. The purpose of the process of scrutinising teaching is often overlooked. It is the purpose of this article to suggest that there are at least three major reasons for these processes: evaluation, assessment and staff appraisal and that they should be separated, with different methods used for each...|$|E

The mechanisms developed for goal interpretation rely on explicit goal recognition (<b>selection)</b> and <b>confirmation</b> of feasibility. A goal state contains all the information required by the planner.

Microarray analysis provides the chance to accelerate studies by comparison of the expression of thousands of genes in these tumours and consequently identify targeting genes. We compared the transcriptional profile of 4, 608 genes in tumours of 15 patients including 6 anaplastic astrocytomas (WHO grade III) and 9 glioblastomas (WHO grade IV) using microarray analysis. The microarray data were corroborated by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of two selected genes.

Our efficient photometric+kinematic selection process identified 104 low-mass candidates which we observed with ground-based spectroscopy. We collected infrared observations of the latest spectral types (>M 5) to search for low gravity objects. These and all <M 5 candidates were observed with high-resolution optical spectrographs to measure the radial velocities and youth indicators, such as lithium absorption and H-alpha emission, needed to confirm BPMG membership, achieving a 63 % confirmation rate. We also compiled the most complete census of the BPMG membership with which we tested the efficiency and false-membership assignments using our <b>selection</b> and <b>confirmation</b> criteria. We assess a group age of 22 +/- 6 Myr using the new census, consistent with past estimates. With the now densely sampled lithium depletion boundary, we resolve the broadening of the boundary by either an age spread or astrophysical influences on lithium burning rates. We find that 69 % of the now known members with AFGKM primaries are M stars, nearing the expected value of 75 %. However, the new IMF for the BPMG shows a deficit of 0. 2 - 0. 3 Msun stars by a factor of approximately 2.

40|$|Background: Alpha-amylases are {{digestive}} enzymes which hydrolyze starch glycosidic bonds to glucose, maltose, maltotriose and dextrin which have diverse applications {{in a wide}} range of industries such as food, textile, paper, detergents representing approximately 30 % of the world enzyme production. Objectives: In this study, the gene encoding the alpha-amylase enzyme of native isolated Bacillus subtilis was ampliﬁed with specific primers containing of NotI and AscI restriction sites by PCR and then sequenced. Purified PCR product and shuttle episomal vector p 316 TDH 3 were cut by restriction enzymes and cloned into Escherichia coli and yeast hosts. Materials and Methods: The haploid auxotroph (ura 3 -) strain of S. cerevisiae and p 316 TDH 3 were used as the host and vector for cloning and expression of the alpha amylase gene, respectively. In native Bacillus sp. the amyE gene without signal sequence was ampliﬁed with specific primers that introduced AscI and NotI restriction sites. After constructing the recombinant plasmid, it was transformed into E. coli competent cells. Then, colonies <b>selection</b> and <b>confirmation</b> were performed and the extracted plasmid was introduced to competent yeast cells using carrier sperm DNA. Recombinant yeast cells could grow on minimal media and produce extracellular enzyme. Results: The presence of alpha-amylase gene in recombinant bacteria was certificated by colony-PCR method.

The findings show that the Senate's powers depend on several factors, such as, the institutional resources with which presidents count in this chamber (which includes not only the size of the parliamentary majority but also their power in the Committee of Acuerdos), the category of the position to be filled (whether involving Supreme Court justices or not), presidential ambitions in other policy areas (such as re-election), and the rules regulating the <b>selection</b> and <b>confirmation</b> of candidates (such as the secrecy or publicity of the legislative process).

Purified AtPAP 15 has been shown to exhibit both phytase and phosphomonoesterase activities in acidic pH with maximal activity at pH 4. 5. AtPAP 15 is a phosphorus starvation inducible (PSI) gene that is expressed highly during phosphorus deficient conditions. In the current study, AtPAP 15 was overexpressed in Nicotiana tabaccum under cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV 35 S) constitutive promoter. After PCR confirmation of the gene, plants were transferred to the greenhouse and allowed to grow in pots. The pots contained Sta-Green potting mix (Lowe’s Inc., Mooresville, North Carolina,U. S.). Individual flowers were covered to ensure selfpollination. Seeds that were generated (T 1 generation) were used for functional analyses. The T 1 seeds were germinated in different phosphorus conditions- phosphorus deficient (0 mM), optimum inorganic phosphorus (1. 25 mM), high inorganic phosphorus (20 mM) and high organic phosphorus (20 mM AMP and IHP) - and analyzed for total biomass, primary root length, soluble phosphorus (Pi) content and acid phosphomonoesterase (Apase) activity. Results demonstrated that under high organic phosphorus conditions, transgenic lines presented increased biomass, longer primary root length, high total soluble phosphorus and high Apase activity than the wild-type. These findings will have important implications for soils with high phosphorus content since most phosphorus in soil is available in organic form.

Until recently, fewer than a half-dozen unobscured quasar sightlines suitable for the HeII Gunn-Peterson test were known; although these handful demonstrated great promise, the small sample size limited confidence in cosmological inferences. We have recently added nine more such clean HeII quasars, exploiting SDSS quasar samples, broadband UV imaging from GALEX, and high-yield UV spectroscopic confirmations from HST. Here we markedly expand this approach by cross-correlating SDSS DR 7 and GALEX GR 4 + 5 to catalog 428 SDSS and 165 other quasars with z> 2. 78 having likely (~ 70 %) GALEX detections, suggesting they are bright into the far-UV.

The current TB lengthy {{antibiotic therapy}} fails {{to be effective}} against multidrug and extremly resistant strains. To this end, improved understanding of the fundamental biology of this complex disease is needed {{to come up with}} radical advances in TB control. Pathology is intimately linked to the interplay between the host immune response and the persistence of the mycobacterium. In the lungs -the major affected organ- M. tuberculosis has a preferential tropism for alveolar macrophages, dendritic cells and type II alveolar pneumocytes. Whereas the colonization of macrophages by M. tuberculosis has been comprehensively studied, much less is knowm abaout that of lungs epithelial cells in which the bacillus penetrates but hardly replicates. To uncover key cellular genes involved in the invasion of M. tuberculosis in pneumocytes, we undertook a genome wide RNAi screening on the M. tuberculosis infected type II pneumocyte cell model A 549. To do this we established a method relying on high content high troughput microscopy enabling the screening of a library of 20 000 RNAi and the <b>selection</b> and <b>confirmation</b> of the 88 RNAi hits. Among them, we carried out a more thorough study on ARFGAP 1 for which silencing led to extensive bacterial internalization inside the epithelial cells followed by strong replication.

We also report observations for 13 / 17 known Tuc-Hor members in this spectral type range, and that 62 additional candidates {{are likely to be}} unassociated field stars; the confirmation frequency for new candidates is therefore 129 / 191 = 67 %. We have used RVs, Halpha emission, and Li 6708 absorption to distinguish contaminants and bona fide members. Our expanded census of Tuc-Hor increases the known population by a factor of ~ 3 in total and by a factor of ~ 8 for members with SpT>K 3, but even so, the K-M dwarf population of Tuc-Hor is still markedly incomplete. The spatial distribution of members appears to trace a 2 D sheet, with a broad distribution in X and Y, but a very narrow distribution (+/- 5 pc) in Z. The corresponding velocity distribution is very small, with a scatter of +/- 1. 1 km/s about the mean UVW velocity. We also show that the isochronal age (20 [...] 30 Myr) and the lithium depletion age (40 Myr) disagree, following a trend seen in other PMS populations. The Halpha emission follows a trend of increasing EW with later SpT, as seen for young clusters. We find that members have been depleted of lithium for spectral types of K 7. 0 -M 4. 5. Finally, our purely kinematic and color-magnitude selection procedure allows us to test the efficiency and completeness for activity-based selection of young stars. We find that 60 % of K-M dwarfs in Tuc-Hor do not have ROSAT counterparts and would be omitted in Xray selected samples. GALEX UV-selected samples using a previously suggested criterion for youth achieve completeness of 77 % and purity of 78 %. We suggest new selection criteria that yield > 95 % completeness for ~ 40 Myr populations. (Abridged) Comment: Accepted to AJ; 28 pages, 12 figures, 5 tables in emulateapj forma...|$|R
40|$|Purpose : To {{evaluate}} peri-operative multicatheter interstitial pulsed-dose-rate brachytherapy (PDR-BT) with an intra-operative catheter placement {{to boost}} the tumor excision site in breast cancer patients treated conservatively. Material and methods: Between May 2002 and October 2008, 96 consecutive T 1 - 3 N 0 - 2 M 0 breast cancer patients underwent breast-conserving therapy (BCT) including peri-operative PDR-BT boost, followed by whole breast external beam radiotherapy (WBRT). The BT dose of 15 Gy (1 Gy/pulse/h) was given {{on the following day}} after surgery. Results: No increased bleeding or delayed wound healing related to the implants were observed. The only side effects included one case of temporary peri-operative breast infection and 3 cases of fat necrosis, both early and late. In 11 patients (11. 4 %), subsequent WBRT was omitted owing to the final pathology findings. These included eight patients who underwent mastectomy due to multiple adverse prognostic pathological features, one case of lobular carcinoma in situ, and two cases with no malignant tumor. With a median follow-up of 12 years (range: 7 - 14 years), among 85 patients who completed BCT, there was one ipsilateral breast tumor and one locoregional nodal recurrence. Six patients developed distant metastases and one was diagnosed with angiosarcoma within irradiated breast. The actuarial 5 - and 10 -year disease free survival was 90 % (95 % CI: 84 - 96 %) and 87 % (95 % CI: 80 - 94 %), respectively, for the patients with invasive breast cancer, and 91 % (95 % CI: 84 - 97 %) and 89 % (95 % CI: 82 - 96 %), respectively, for patients who completed BCT. Good cosmetic outcome by self-assessment was achieved in 58 out of 64 (91 %) evaluable patients. Conclusions : Peri-operative PDR-BT boost with intra-operative tube placement followed by EBRT is feasible and devoid of considerable toxicity, and provides excellent long-term local control. However, this strategy necessitates careful patient <b>selection</b> and histological <b>confirmation</b> of primary diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|The {{value is}} a social event that has an {{important}} role in the human life, since forming of firstly societies till now. In reality, the human life has been formed from set of selections that people set forth from that a system of values. The nature of value is <b>selection</b> and freely <b>confirmation</b> on one hand value is guidance and determiner of social trends and on the other hand determiner of social action and manner that are manifesting on rules and manners, regulations, holy principles and routine life methods (Schwartz and Anat 2004). Indeed values are mental judgment of people. In reality these are values that form special frameworks for social people-because they know which manner is suitable in each situation. The values are important determiner of the performance method, actions&rsquo; route and how to prefer targets in cultural,educational, family, political and religious systems for each society. In scope of considering for manner science, the values are one of the pivotal conceptions that has created the background of convergence amid different scopes of humanities and acted as a key conception for systematic studying in humanities (Schwartz, 1999). Understanding of thevalues of commercial students is useful for their guidance can be used for rising of education, reinforcement and their successive training. The commercial students will be coming professionals and nowadays people pay attention to the ethical in jobs and the members of profession are encouraged to follow the whole ethics, furthermore the understanding of values for commercial students is useful for their guidance. Determining of value differences between men and women with the remarkable presence of women in commercial jobs can be important for anticipating and controlling of coming manners that are related to job and managing ofhuman recourses. Furthermore considering of ethical insight of commercial students and men and women seem essential. The aim of this article is comparison of ethical values and value systems between accounting and non accounting students and men and women...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{study is}} an {{in-depth}} empirical investigation {{that seeks to}} compare consumer expectations to perceptions {{in the delivery of}} service within community banks in the southern United States. It has as its aim to develop a useful instrument to evaluate service quality by comparing consumer expectations to their perceptions of delivered service. An additional purpose is to determine bank chief executive officers’ ability to predict consumer expectations in the area of service delivery. The theoretical portion of the study focused upon a review of the history of banking in the United States and its subunit, the State of Texas, which is uniquely different from the banking systems of Europe and Asia. The literature was also examined to review service quality and customer satisfaction. In order to examine methods to predict service quality in community banks, an investigation was carried out among consumers of fifteen community banks in the southern United States. The collection of the data was driven by six research hypotheses and involved two questionnaires. One questionnaire ask for customer expectations versus perceptions. A second questionnaire required the chief executive officers of the consumers’ banks to state their perceptions of what their consumers expected in the way of service delivery. The main findings of the research built upon and extended the research by Ittner and Larcker (1996) which noted that the three prime components of customer satisfaction revolved around three specific antecedents—perceived quality, perceived value, and customer expectations, the study strongly reinforced and confirmed the importance of the three antecedents. This study indicated that while expectations are very high, perceptions are also high, but not as high as expectations. Milligan (1995) advanced the idea that it should be obvious that the element of service quality was the primary driver in bank <b>selection,</b> but no <b>confirmation</b> study was made by him or others comparing the five factors (service quality, location, advertising, recommendation of others, and service charges/fees). This study concluded that service quality was {{the most important factor in}} the selection of a community bank in the southern United States. With no specific literature relating specifically to bankers’ perceptions of service delivery expectations by consumers, one of the most significant findings in this study noted that 77. 3 percent of the responses to the questions indicated a match of bankers’ perceptions with consumers’ expectations. While outcomes indicated that perceptions were equal to or greater than expectations, this does not conclusively prove that satisfactory service quality will tend to be associated with outcomes equal to or above expectations. This could indicate that the customers did not expect much in the way of outstanding service. Based upon results obtained from surveys, there appears to be a high likelihood that a bank could reasonably predict the retention of customers using the overlaid plots that in this study show high expectations and high perceptions. However, this study could not conclusively substantiate that gender, income, and education impact service quality in community banks. Given the limited amount of literature relating to the delivery of service quality by community banks in the United States, this study provides both researchers and practitioners an empirical study of both consumers’ and bankers’ expectations and perceptions of service delivery, which had not been fully explored in the past...|$|R
