50|$|Drill string compensators {{are just}} giant springs between the drill bit and rig. These consist {{of one or}} more {{hydraulic}} cylinders and air bottles. In between, a medium separator is sometimes used. If there is no <b>spring</b> <b>element,</b> movement of the drill rig would immediately place enormous forces on the drill bit and pull the drill bit off the bottom of the hole.A spring has a force/displacement curve. To get only small force variations on the drill bit, the hysteresis of the spring should be small and the curve should be horizontal, or the gas volume should be large. This is more difficult for a hook-mounted compensator than for a top-mounted one. Several patents are in use for a solution to provide this horizontal curve with a relatively small volume of gas.
