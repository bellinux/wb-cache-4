50|$|A spinner <b>handle</b> is a <b>shaft</b> and <b>handle</b> with a drive fitting—most {{commonly}} ¼"—at {{the end for}} attaching interchangeable sockets. This {{allows one}} to use a single handle {{with a number of}} sizes instead of having a separate nut driver for each size. However, a spinner lacks the benefit of a hollow shaft; thus, a common alternative system is a single <b>handle</b> with interchangeable <b>shafts</b> in each size.|$|R

These were attached to <b>shafts</b> or <b>handles</b> by means of ochre and plant adhesive or alternatively fat mixed with plant material. Segments often were made with a cutting edge along their entire length, which requires that they be attached to their hafts without twine and so, calls for particularly strong adhesive glue.|$|R

5000|$|Phillips {{screwdrivers}} come {{in several}} standard sizes, ranging from tiny [...] "jeweler's" [...] {{to those used}} for automobile frame assembly—or #000 to #4 respectively. This size number is usually stamped onto the shank (<b>shaft)</b> or <b>handle</b> for identification. Each bit size fits a range of screw sizes, more or less well. Each Phillips screwdriver size also has a related shank diameter. The driver has a 57° point and tapered, unsharp (rounded) flutes. The #1 and smaller bits come to a blunt point, but the #2 and above have no point, but rather a nearly squared-off tip, making each size incompatible with the other.|$|R

The index and middle finger typically guide the <b>shaft,</b> while the <b>handle</b> is cradled in the palm.

50|$|Paddles {{commonly}} used in canoes consist of a wooden, fibreglass, carbon fibre or metal rod (the <b>shaft)</b> with a <b>handle</b> on one end and a rigid sheet (the blade) on the other end.

500|$|A defender is {{a player}} {{position}} whose primary {{responsibility is to}} prevent the opposing team from scoring. Unlike in field lacrosse where some defensive players carry [...] "long poles" [...] (a lacrosse stick with a [...] <b>shaft</b> or <b>handle),</b> all box lacrosse defenders play with a maximum [...] long stick. Defensive tactics include cross checking (where a player uses the shaft of his stick to push the opposition player off balance), body checking (where a player makes contact with the opposition player in order to slow him down), and stick checking (where a player makes contact with the opposition player's stick in order to knock the ball loose).|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} form of {{electroless}} nickel plating produces a nickel phosphorus alloy coating. The phosphorus content in electroless nickel coatings can range from 2% to 13%. It is commonly used in engineering coating applications where wear resistance, hardness and corrosion protection are required. Applications include oil field valves, rotors, drive <b>shafts,</b> paper <b>handling</b> equipment, fuel rails, optical surfaces for diamond turning, door knobs, kitchen utensils, bathroom fixtures, electrical/mechanical tools and office equipment. It is also commonly used as a coating in electronics printed circuit board manufacturing, typically with an overlay of gold to prevent corrosion. This process is known as electroless nickel immersion gold.|$|R
5000|$|A {{nut driver}} {{is a tool}} for {{tightening}} nuts and bolts.

They are typically used for lower torque applications than wrenches or ratchets and are frequently used in the appliance repair and electronics industries.|$|R

Most screws are [...] "self locking" [...] and axial force on the shaft will not turn the screw.|$|R
50|$|Most {{examples}} of eccentric flints {{have been recovered}} from caches interred under Maya monuments and buildings. Thus, a cache under the altar of Copan's stela M, {{at the foot of}} the Hieroglyphic Stairway, rendered three identical eccentric flints, each shaped like a human figure extending into a tang and evincing six human head outgrowths. Nine eccentric flints with human figures found in an early Copan temple room (temple 16, Rosalila phase), and originally wrapped in a deep blue cloth, show similar tangs. The presence of these tangs suggests that the examples concerned may originally have been set into a <b>shaft</b> or <b>handle,</b> possibly as the head of a sceptre, or as the blade of an axe. Some flint eccentrics were unsuitable for wearing or carrying and they may have been sculpted specifically to be buried as an offering.|$|R

50|$|The {{elevator}} motor {{was located}} {{at the top of}} the shaft or beside the bottom of the <b>shaft.</b> Pushing the <b>handle</b> forward would cause the cab to rise; backwards would make it sink. The harder the pressure, the faster the elevator would move. The handle also served as a dead man switch: if the operator let go of the handle, it would return to its upright position, causing the elevator cab to stop. In time, safety interlocks would ensure that the inner and outer doors were closed before the elevator was allowed to move.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an Optical 3 D Shaft Inspection System needed for the survey and monitoring of Water <b>Handling</b> <b>Shafts</b> in the German Ruhrgebiet. The development is part of the RAG R&D project “ABSMon”. The end of the German hard coal mining at the end of 2018 has been determined with the Steinkohlefinanzierungsgesetz (SteinkohleFinG) from 2007 - 12 - 20. About three hundred years before now the near surface hard coal mining began in the southern Ruhr Area and in our days advanced to the northern Ruhr Area with mining depth of around - 1. 500 meters. The mine workings are kept dry by mine water pumping. When the active mining activities will have finished a controlled Water Handling will raise and keep the mine water to levels predetermined by the Mining Authorities. A monitoring with a mobile wireline shaft survey system is needed to run the Water <b>Handling</b> <b>Shafts</b> for an enduring Water Management. At the moment only laser scanner systems are available, but also optical systems are needed to enable the near real-time inspection with 3 D presentation and 3 D examination during the measurement campaign. An approach is presented that uses a camera to generate high resolution and textured 3 D models of mining shafts and tunnels for inspection purposes...|$|R
50|$|For the {{purposes}} of this article the ball will be assumed to be 73 mm in diameter. Ball size does play a significant part in stickwork and ball control (as does the weight and hardness of the ball) but an investigation of these is outside the scope of this article. The width of stick handles does vary (as does the horizontal length of stick heads) but for clarity and convenience the <b>shaft</b> of the <b>handle</b> just above the head has been taken as 46 mm, which is fairly common, and the sticks scaled from that measurement.|$|R
50|$|In 1910 Arthur Roussel {{was hired}} to build a machine that would enable the public to view a film inside their home. Pathé Frères {{introduced}} a 28 mm film size for home use. 28 mm film was preferable because it wasn’t as flammable as the nitrate based 35 mm film, usage of the 28 mm film also gave Pathé Frères exclusivity, by way of patents. The 28 mm wide film had one sprocket hole per frame on one edge of the film, 3 on the other; the large image size of 19 mm x 14 mm allowed the projected picture to be of a very high quality.The 28 mm Pathéscope K.O.K. cine-projector was patented in 1911. This projector featured dynamo lighting which was “powered by a belt from a large flywheel connected to the main <b>shaft.</b> The <b>handle</b> had to be manually turned in order to project a 30 inch picture. The projector “sold for 30 dollars which included two printed films, a screen, metal carrying case and cleaning outfit.|$|R
