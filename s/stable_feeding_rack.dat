50|$|The stable is {{typically}} historically the second-oldest building type on the farm. The world’s oldest horse stables {{were discovered in}} the ancient city of Pi-Ramesses in Qantir, in Ancient Egypt, and were established by Ramesses II (c.1304-1237 BC). These stables covered approximately 182,986 square feet, had floors sloped for drainage, and could contain about 480 horses.Free-standing stables began to be built from the 16th century. They were well built and placed near the house due to the value that the horses had as draught animals. High-status examples could have plastered ceilings to prevent dust falling through into the horses’ eyes. Relatively few examples survive of complete interiors (i.e. with stalls, mangers and <b>feed</b> <b>racks)</b> from the mid-19th century or earlier.|$|R

Twelve healthy Italian Holstein cows, divided into two homogeneous groups of six each, were involved. The TMR delay was applied either for one (on Tuesday; single delay, SD) or for three consecutive days (Tuesday to Thursday; repeated delay, RD) to one group at a time while the other acted as control. A week of pause was interposed between treatments and the order of the treatment was randomised. Behaviour was observed by instantaneous scan sampling every 2 min during seven half-hour periods on Tuesday and Thursday and blood samples were taken at 14 : 30 h on these days. Milk yield was recorded daily. Data were analysed by a mixed models for repeated measurements. The delay caused a marked increase in activities towards the <b>feeding</b> <b>rack</b> prior to <b>feeding</b> on day 1 when delay was applied both as SD (P< 0. 01) and RD (P< 0. 05). On the third day of delay, pre- and post-meal agonistic behaviour increased in delayed cows (P< 0. 01). Milk yield and blood parameters were not affected by the delay.

The results indicated that there were no significant differences in the energy, fat, or ash content of milk and cheese due to feeding; however, a significant influence of feeding on cheese protein and fatty acids in both milk and cheese was detected. Feeding on scrubby rangeland tended to increase the amounts of major polyunsaturated fatty acids in milk and cheese from goats. Pasteurization, which is mandatory in Mexico, did not alter the fatty acid concentrations in milk or cheese. Small goat-keepers using rangeland resources might claim better economical returns for products recognized as healthier.

40|$|During {{the last}} decades, many dairy farmers have {{actively}} advanced their farms toward automation. Automatic concentrate dispensers and automatic milking {{systems have been}} utilised for years, and several manufacturers have introduced automatic feeding systems (AFS). AFSs allow for the increase in frequency of feed distribution with significant advantages in terms of health and production. Furthermore, they provide a reduction of man labour related to preparation of feed, distribution, and propelling the ration closer to the <b>feeding</b> <b>rack.</b> The present research {{was focused on the}} monitoring of a dairy farm, located in the Veneto region of Italy, during the transition from a conventional feeding system (CFS), based on a tractor operated mixing wagon, to an automatic system equipped with stationary feeding hoppers, mixing unit, and distribution wagon operating on rail. The article reports a comparative analysis of the structural modifications required for the adoption of AFS, including an analysis of the AFS/CFS systems based on their functionality, energy, and man labour requirements.

In addition, AFS demonstrated a reduction in labour requirements and improvement of quality and consistency of work when feeding total mixed ration.
