500|$|The {{simplest}} of these circuits are {{a form of}} rectifier which take an AC voltage as input and outputs a doubled DC voltage. [...] The switching elements are simple diodes and they are driven to switch state merely by the alternating voltage of the input. [...] DC-to-DC voltage doublers cannot switch in this way and require a driving circuit to control the switching. [...] They frequently also require a <b>switching</b> <b>element</b> that can be controlled directly, such as a transistor, {{rather than relying on}} the voltage across the switch as in the simple AC-to-DC case.|$|E
500|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} and {{improvements to the}} basic Dickson charge pump. [...] Many of these are concerned with reducing {{the effect of the}} transistor drain-source voltage. [...] This can be very significant if the input voltage is small, such as a low-voltage battery. [...] With ideal switching elements the output is an integral multiple of the input (two for a doubler) but with a single-cell battery as the input source and MOSFET switches the output will be far less than this value since much of the voltage will be dropped across the transistors. [...] For a circuit using discrete components the Schottky diode would be a better choice of <b>switching</b> <b>element</b> for its extremely low voltage drop in the on state.

2500|$|The basic LCC {{configuration}} for HVDC uses a three-phase Graetz {{bridge rectifier}} or six-pulse bridge, containing six electronic switches, each connecting {{one of the}} three phases to one of the two DC terminals. A complete <b>switching</b> <b>element</b> is usually referred to as a valve, irrespective of its construction.

The two conducting valves connect two of the three AC phase voltages, in series, to the DC terminals. [...] Thus, the DC output voltage at any given instant is given by the series combination of two AC phase voltages. For example, if valves V1 and V2 are conducting, the DC output voltage is given by the voltage of phase 1 minus the voltage of phase 3.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an introduction to}} the design and simulation of a novel class of integrated photonic phased array <b>switch</b> <b>elements.</b> The main objective is to use nano-electromechanical (NEMS) based phase shifters of cascaded under-etched slot nanowires that are compact in size and require a small amount of power to operate them. The structure of the <b>switch</b> <b>elements</b> is organized such that it brings the phase shifting elements to the exterior sides of the photonic circuits. The transition slot couplers, used to interconnect the phase shifters, are designed to enable biasing one of the silicon beams of each phase shifter from an electrode located {{at the side of the}} phase shifter. The other silicon beam of each phase shifter is biased through the rest of the silicon structure of the <b>switch</b> <b>element,</b> which is taken as a ground. Phased array <b>switch</b> <b>elements</b> ranging from 2 × 2 up to 8 × 8 multiple-inputs/multiple-outputs (MIMO) are conveniently designed within reasonable footprints native to the current fabrication technologies. Chapter one presents the general layout of the various designs of the <b>switch</b> <b>elements</b> and demonstrates their novel features. This demonstration will show how waveguide disturbances in the interconnecting network from conventional <b>switch</b> <b>elements</b> can be avoided by adopting an innovative design. Some possible applications for the designed <b>switch</b> <b>elements</b> of different sizes and topologies are indicated throughout the chapter. Chapter two presents the design of the multimode interference (MMI) couplers used in the <b>switch</b> <b>elements</b> as splitters, combiners and waveguide crossovers. Simulation data and design methodologies for the multimode couplers of interest are detailed in this chapter. Chapter three presents the design and analysis of the NEMS-operated phase shifters. Both simulations and numerical analysis are utilized in the design of a 0 º- 180 º capable NEMS-operated phase shifter. Additionally, the response of some of the designed photonic phased array <b>switch</b> <b>elements</b> is demonstrated in this chapter.

A typical MIN consists of layers of <b>switching</b> <b>elements</b> that are connected {{together in a}} predefined topology. The routing capability of a network depends on its specific topology.

While delay jitter has been extensively studied in relation to various scheduling and routing algorithms, it has rarely been studied in relation to the properties of the network topology and the internal architecture of <b>switching</b> <b>elements.</b> The relationships between delay jitter and various attributes of the network are important in best-effort networks such as the Internet as well as in networks that allow negotiation of QoS parameters, such as in ATM networks.
