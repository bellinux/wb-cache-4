The optical scheme of a laser projection microscope (LPM) with a liquid crystal modulator (LCM) in treatment, observation and recording channels has been proposed, implemented and investigated. In the proposed scheme, LCM {{can act as a}} light beam <b>splitter,</b> <b>attenuator</b> and modulator simultaneously.

40|$|For {{long range}} {{transmissions}} of high {{amounts of data}} the glass fiber is the medium of choice. For an optical network many different connection devices are needed, such as multiplexers, <b>splitters,</b> <b>attenuators</b> etc. Typically such waveguide-based devices are produced using silica technology which involve cost intensive multi-step processes. In contrast to the inorganic waveguides polymer technology provides a lot of advantages, such as lower production costs, temperature insensitive devices and switches with low switching power. The authors have been working several years {{on the development of}} polymers for optical application. The current work is focussed on three material systems, polycyanurate ester resins, polyacrylates and triazine containing polymers. This paper focusses on the triazine containing polymers and the reduction of their birefringence via adjusting the CTE of the substrate...|$|R
40|$|Institute of Reliable Embedded Systems and Communication Electronics, Offenburg University of Applied Sciences, Germany has {{developed}} an automated testing environment, Automated Physical TestBeds (APTB), for analyzing the performance of wireless systems and its supporting protocols. Wireless physical networking nodes can connect to this APTB and the antenna output of this attaches with the RF waveguides. To model the RF environment this RF waveguides then establish wired connection among RF elements like <b>splitters,</b> <b>attenuators</b> and switches. In such kind of set up it’s well possible to vary the path characteristics by altering the attenuators and switches. The major advantage of using APTB {{is the possibility of}} isolated, well controlled, repeatable test environment in various conditions to run statistical analysis and even to execute regression tests. This paper provides an overview of the design and implementation of APTB, demonstrates its ability to automate test cases, and its efficiency...|$|R
40|$|The {{amount of}} data {{transferred}} via the internet redoubles every eight month, {{this results in a}} strong increasing demand on bandwidth. Today glass fiber is the medium of choice for long range transmission, but for an optical network a lot of devices, such as multiplexer, <b>splitter,</b> <b>attenuators</b> etc. are needed. Typically such waveguide-based devices are produced by using silica, but in contrast to the inorganic waveguides polymers provide a lot of advantages, such as lower production costs, temperature insensitive devices and switches with low switching power. Developed in the late sixties as base materials for printed circuit boards polycyanurate ester resins are a relatively new class of polymers. They have a high thermostability and amazing mechanical properties. Our past work was focussed on highly fluorinated polycyanurate systems for use as waveguide materials in integrated optics. Low optical losses of less than 0. 3 dB/cm 1550 nm were obtained and working optical prototypes were developed also. Our actual work is focused on related polymeric systems, which should remedy some disadvantages of the neat polycyanurates. Because of its outstanding thermomechanical properties and its excellent polishing ability, we extended the use of triazine-containing polymers as substrate materials for optical waveguiding devices. This paper is focused on the development of alternate triazine-containing polymeric substrates, the production of athermal integrated optical devices and the adjustment of the substrate-properties. For these specific devices polyacrylate systems are used as waveguiding materials...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we have {{demonstrated}} the fabrication of two different classes of devices which demonstrate the integration of simple MEMS structures with photonics structures. In the first class of device a suspended, movable Si waveguide was designed and fabricated. This waveguide {{was designed to be}} able to be actuated so that it could be brought into close proximity to a ring resonator or similar structure. In the course of this work we also designed a technique to improve the input coupling to the waveguide. While these structures were successfully fabricated, post fabrication and testing involved a significant amount of manipulation of the devices and due to their relatively flimsy nature our structures could not readily survive this extra handling. As a result we redesigned our devices so that instead of moving the waveguides themselves we moved a much smaller optical element into close proximity to the waveguides. Using this approach it was also possible to fabricate a much larger array of actively switched photonic devices: switches, ring resonators, couplers (which act as switches or <b>splitters)</b> and <b>attenuators.</b> We successfully fabricated all these structures and were able to successfully demonstrate <b>splitters,</b> switches and <b>attenuators.</b> The quality of the SiN waveguides fabricated in this work were found to be qualitatively compatible to those made using semiconductor materials...|$|R
50|$|Any {{component}} of the transmission line that has an input and output {{will contribute to the}} overall mismatch loss of the system. For example, in mixers mismatch loss occurs when there is an impedance mismatch between the RF port and IF port of the mixer. This is one of the principal reasons for losses in mixers. Likewise, a large amount of the loss in amplifiers comes from the mismatch between the input and output. Consequently, not all of the available power generated by the amplifier gets transferred to the load. This is most important in antenna systems where mismatch loss in the transmitting and receiving antenna directly contributes to the losses the system—including the system noise figure. Other common RF system components such as filters, <b>attenuators,</b> <b>splitters,</b> and combiners will generate some amount of mismatch loss. While completely eliminating mismatch loss in these components is near impossible, mismatch loss contributions by each component can be minimized by selecting quality components for use in a well designed system.|$|R
40|$|Abstract − The present {{contribution}} {{is focused on}} the measurement of the degradation induced in the case of two <b>splitters</b> and two <b>attenuators</b> used in optical fiber communication systems, under gamma and neutron irradiation. The measurements were carried out at specific wavelengths (λ = 1310 nm and λ = 1550 nm) or over a spectral band (λ = 1510 – 1620 nm), in order to evaluate the wavelength dependence of the phenomena. These components were also tested as it concerns the changes of the polarization state of optical radiation they guide. A second investigation was performed on the degradation of the operational parameters for a laser diode driving circuit and a Peltier TEC (thermoelectric cooler), under gammaray, neutron and electron beam irradiation. No significant changes were noticed in the spectral transmission of the two passive components, but the degradation of the light polarization parameters was a significant one under gammaray irradiation. In the case of the laser diode drivers a drop of 80 % of the laser diode optical power and the embedded photodiode responsivity was observed under gamma-ray and neutron irradiation...|$|R
40|$|Next-generation {{wireless}} mobile communications will {{be driven}} by converged networks that integrate disparate technologies and services. Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) {{are expected to be}} one of the next generation of wireless interconnection technologies, providing flexible high bandwidth wireless backhaul over large geographical areas. While single radio mesh nodes operating on a single channel suffer from capacity constraints, equipping mesh routers with multiple radios using multiple non-overlapping channels can significantly alleviate the capacity problem and increase the aggregate bandwidth available to the network. However, it is well known that multi-radio Mesh platforms face many limitations such as interference, radiation leakage, crosstalk and limited computing resource etc. A misperception among researchers is that the so called “crosstalk” is one of the limiting factors to the performance decrease in multi-radio Mesh networks, but through a series of experiments the results shows otherwise. In this paper, we present a unique experimental approach that utilizes antenna cables, <b>splitters,</b> couplers and <b>attenuators</b> etc. to create a controlled wireless environment, and results indicates, despite negligible effect, crosstalk is not a limiting factor, but rather the finite computing resource constrains the aggregated performance of multi-radio Mesh networks, and several other factors have been investigated as well...|$|R
40|$|All the {{commercial}} radios are half duplex {{in a sense}} that they are unable to transmitand receive at the same time on the same frequency. A full duplex radio simultaneouslytransmits and receives at that same time and on the same frequency thus doublingthe throughput of the existing systems. One of the fundamental challenges in enablingfull duplex is the cancellation of the self-interference that is caused by device’s owntransmitter. Considering the high level of the self-interference at the receiver front end,it is necessary to cancel out the interference in the analog domain to avoid the ADCsaturation. As one of the major focus of this thesis, all the existing methods, algorithmsand accomplishments in enabling full duplex have been summarized. A novel methodfor interference cancellation using cables, power <b>splitters</b> and step <b>attenuators</b> has beenimplemented on the actual hardware and its performance evaluation and limitations have been summarized. Currently deployed cellular networks use bands which have been licensed andapproved by the FCC. With the developments in cellular standards Rel- 10 LTE advanced which supports carrier aggregation has been established where a multiple carriers are aggregated to provide a larger bandwidth. As cellular operators explore the possibility of extending the carrier aggregation to the unlicensed spectrum in the 5 GHz, current developments in creating a friendly ecosystem in unlicensed bands have been summarized which form the basis of Rel- 13 LTE- Licensed Assisted Access...|$|R
