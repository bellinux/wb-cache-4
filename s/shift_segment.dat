25|$|The {{escalation}} of the Rhodesian Bush War in the 1970s led to {{a significant amount of}} rural displacement and interrupted agricultural activity. The disruption of veterinary services resulted in massive livestock losses, and the cultivation of cash crops was hampered by guerrilla raids. The murder of about three hundred white farmers during the war, as well as the conscription of hundreds of others into the Rhodesian Security Forces, also led to a drop in the volume of agricultural production. Between 1975 and 1976 Rhodesia's urban population doubled as thousands of rural dwellers, mostly from TTLs, fled to the cities to escape the fighting. A campaign of systematic villagisation followed as the Rhodesian Army <b>shifted</b> <b>segments</b> of the black population into guarded settlements to prevent their subversion by the insurgents.|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{describe}} the configuration, and investigate the mechanisms, of QRS changes occurring during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Background. QRS changes during PTCA have been attributed to both a passive ST <b>segment</b> <b>shift</b> and conduction disturbances (peri-ischemic block). The direct relation between ST <b>segment</b> <b>shift</b> and QRS changes, however, has not been established, and the definition of conduction disturbances remains to be clarified. Methods. Twelve-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) were recorded before PTCA, at the end of 2 min of PTCA and after return to baseline values in 29 patients (left anterior descending coronary artery [LAD] in 13 patients, right coronary artery [RCA] in 14 and left circumflex coronary artery in 2). Electrocardiographic complexes before and during PTCA were superimposed to determine the amplitudes of initial, terminal and total QRS deflection; the relations of QRS changes to baseline (TP segment) and ST segment shift; and the duration of QRS and corrected QT intervals. Results. 1) The direction of the initial QRS deflection was unchanged, but changes of its amplitude occurred. 2) Terminal QRS deflection changed in all patients with a ST <b>segment</b> <b>shift</b> > 17 % of the R amplitude, and the correlation between the decrease in the S amplitude and ST <b>segment</b> <b>shift</b> was significant (r = 0. 9, p < 0. 01) in patients with LAD PTCA. Correlation between changes in total QRS amplitude and ST <b>segment</b> <b>shift</b> in patients with RCA PTCA was weaker (r = 0. 54, p = 0. 056). 3) Transient conduction disturbance manifested by QRS widening in selected leads occurred in 2 of 29 patients. Conclusions. 1) Changes in terminal QRS deflection during PTCA are proportional to the magnitude of the ST <b>segment</b> <b>shift.</b> 2) Conduction disturbances manifested by increased QRS duration occurred infrequently. We suggest that the term peri-ischemic block be applied only to changes in QRS configuration associated with QRS widening...|$|R
40|$|We aim at {{efficiently}} classifying ALS data {{in urban}} areas by choosing an optimal combination of features and entities. Three kinds of entities are defined, namely, single points, planar segments and segments obtained by mean-shift segmentation. Various features are computed for these three entities. All derived features are assigned to different steps of our method. Our method is composed of a sequence of rule based classifications. After a rule based classification for planar segments and a context rule based classification for walls and roof elements 85 % of the data are well classified. Errors mainly appear {{in the area where}} rules are difficult to define, such as vegetation close to walls and above roofs. To eliminate these errors, we first group all the points in these areas into <b>segments</b> using mean <b>shift,</b> and then search for segments with potentially misclassified points using a distance ratio.

40|$|Although ST <b>segment</b> <b>shift</b> is {{a marker}} of {{myocardial}} ischemia, some patients have no ST <b>segment</b> <b>shift</b> during {{percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty}} (PTCA). The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate myocardial perfusion and metabolism in adaptation for ischemia using 201 TI and 123 I-BMIPP dual exercise stress myocardial single photon emission computed tomog-raphy (SPECT) (dual stress SPECT). In 28 patients with coronary artery disease, dual stress SPECT was performed 3 weeks before PTCA. Early and delayed images were obtained at 5 minutes and at 3 hours after termination of ergometer stress, respectively. During PTCA, 12 -lead ECG was recorded, and a significant ST <b>segment</b> <b>shift</b> was defined as more than 1 mm elevation or a depression of the J-point at the first ballooning. No collateral circulation on the coronary angiogram or 201 TI filling on the delayed images were observed on any of the target regions of PTCA. Patients were divided into 2 groups: with (Group A: n = 15) and without (Group B: n = 13) significant ST <b>segment</b> <b>shift</b> during PTCA. A redistribution of TI was observed in 14 (93 %) of Group A and 10 (77 %) of Group B patients. Incidence of BMIPP redistribution was significantly higher in Group B (11 [85 %]) than in Group A (3 [20 %]) (p < 0. 05). Redistribution of BMIPP means suppression of fatty acid metabolism during exercise stress. Augmentation of glucose metabolism is speculated to be an energy source in ischemic preconditioning...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{sought to}} study the {{relation}} between recurrent ST <b>segment</b> <b>shift</b> within 6 to 24 h of initial resolution of ST elevation after thrombolytic therapy and 30 -day and 1 -year mortality. Background. Rapid and stable resolution of ST segment elevation in relation to thrombolytic therapy in patients with an acute myocardial infarction is an indicator of culprit artery patency. Whether recurrence of ST <b>segment</b> <b>shift</b> during continuous ST monitoring after initial resolution is related to poor prognosis has not been studied. Methods. ST segment monitoring was performed within 30 min after thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. The predictive value of a new ST <b>segment</b> <b>shift</b> (assessed as ≥ 0. 1 -mV deviation from the baseline) 6 to 24 h after thrombolytic therapy was studied with respect to 30 -day and 1 -year mortality. Results. Of 734 patients, 243 had a new ST <b>segment</b> <b>shift</b> (33 %). The 30 -day mortality rate in patients with an ST shift (7. 8 %) {{was significantly higher than}} that in patients without an ST shift (2. 25 %, p = 0. 001), as was the 1 -year mortality rate (10. 3 % vs. 5. 7 %, respectively, p = 0. 025). Multivariable analysis revealed an independent predictive value of ST shift with respect to 30 -day mortality (p = 0. 008), even after consideration of multiple clinical risk factors in the overall Global Utilization of Streptokinase and TPA for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO) -I mortality model (p = 0. 0001). Moreover, the duration of the ST shift bore a direct relation with 1 -year mortality (p = 0. 008). Conclusions. Detection of ST <b>segment</b> <b>shift</b> early after thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction is a simple, noninvasive means of identifying patients at high risk and is superior to other commonly assessed clinical risk factors. Thus, patients with a new ST shift after the first 6 h, but within 24 h, represent a high risk group that may benefit from more aggressive intervention, whereas patients without evidence of an ST shift represent a low risk subgroup...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine in patients with unstable angina whether specific electrocardiographic abnormalities associated with ischemia, the presence of coronary lesions consistent with thrombosis on angiography or the presence of recurrent ischemia reflects increases in thrombin activity as manifested by increased plasma concentrations of fibrinopeptide A. The concentration of fibrinopeptide A in plasma was increased to 6. 7 ± 3. 1 nMfor the group as a whole (n = 29). Increases were greater in the 17 patients who exhibited reversible ST <b>segment</b> <b>shifts</b> (10. 2 ± 5. 2 nM) than in the 12 patients exhibiting reversible T wave abnormalities alone (1. 6 ± 0. 2 nM) (p < 0. 01).

40|$|Soral {{position}} has variously {{been used as}} a character in evaluating fern phylogeny. SEM study has shown that the leaf meristem system in tree ferns is primarily organized around a conspicuous marginal file of superficial, actively-dividing initial cells. In Cibotium the soral receptacle originates directly from the cells of the marginal initial file. The outer and inner indusia arise simultaneously early in development, on the adaxial and abaxial sides of the receptacle, respectively. In contrast, the receptacle in Dicksonia originates from an adaxially <b>shifted</b> <b>segment</b> of the marginal initial file. Furthermore, the outer indusium is initiated first, approximately at the time of receptacular differentiation, whereas the inner indusium does not become evident until after several sporangial rows have been initiated. Despite these differences, both genera demonstrate a fundamental relationship between the soral receptacle and the initial cells of the marginal meristem. Historically, a slightly abaxial position of the receptacle in Dicksonia was presupposed as a foundation of the 2 ̆ 2 phylogenetic slide 2 ̆ 2 in ontogeny of the sorus of tree ferns. This is shown to be in error and phylogenetic relationships based on this and other morphogenetic suppositions must be reexamined. It is proposed that a strict developmental definition of soral position may have phylogenetic significance. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHumans {{are remarkably}} {{sensitive}} in detecting small deviations from circularity. In tasks involving discrimination between closed contours, either circular in shape or defined by sinusoidal modulations {{of the circle}} radius, human performance {{has been shown to}} be limited by global processing. We assessed the amount of global pooling for different pattern shapes (different radial modulation frequencies, RF) when circular deformation was restricted to a fraction of the contour. The results show that the improvement in performance depends on the modulation frequency (the pattern shape) when increasing the number of cycles of an RF pattern. Global processing only extends up to modulation frequencies between 5 and 10. For higher frequencies, performance can be predicted by probability summation. Position uncertainty cannot explain these effects. In a circumstance where global pooling exceeds probability summation (RF= 5), we split the pattern up into five identical segments conserving the total amount of information presented. Thresholds are significantly affected by different global arrangements of these segments: (a) Occluding small parts of the pattern shows a significant effect on the position of occluders with performance lowest when gaps are placed at the points of maximum curvature. (b) <b>Shifting</b> <b>segments</b> away from the pattern centre (exploded condition) or displaying them out of concentric context (spiral condition) shuts down global processing. (c) Jittering segments radially disrupts both global and local processing. We conclude that RF patterns in the global processing range are analysed by detecting the points of maximum curvature and that, in this range, the visual system can only reliably process up to about 5 local curvature extrema...|$|R
5000|$|The 8088 is also (like the 8086) slow at {{accessing}} memory. The same ALU {{that is used}} {{to execute}} arithmetic and logic instructions is also used to calculate effective addresses. (There is a separate adder for adding a <b>shifted</b> <b>segment</b> register to the offset address, but the offset EA itself is always calculated entirely in the main ALU.) Furthermore, the loose coupling of the EU and BIU (bus unit) inserts communication overhead between the units, and the four-clock period bus transfer cycle is not particularly streamlined. (Contrast the two-clock period bus cycle of the 6502 CPU and the 80286's three-clock period bus cycle with pipelining down to two cycles for most transfers.) Most 8088 instructions that can operate on either registers or memory, including common ALU and data-movement operations, are at least four times slower for memory operands than for only register operands. Therefore, efficient 8088 (and 8086) programs avoid repeated access of memory operands when possible, loading operands from memory into registers to work with them there and storing back only the finished results. The relatively large general register set of the 8088 compared to its contemporaries assists this strategy. When there are not enough registers for all variables that are needed at once, saving registers by pushing them onto the stack and popping them back to restore them is the fastest way to use memory to augment the registers, as the stack PUSH and POP instructions are the fastest memory operations. (The same is probably not true on the 80286 and later; they have dedicated address ALUs and perform memory accesses much faster than the 8088 and 8086.) ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a computer simulation of electrocardiographic ST <b>segment</b> <b>shift</b> in myocardial ischaemia to elucidate {{the source of}} ST changes in both subendocardial and transmural ischaemia. A realistic torso model was constructed, in which the myocardium was represented by the bidomain model. In a normal heart, there is no current source during the ST segment {{and there is a}} minimal ST potential field. With myocardial ischaemia, the transmembrane potential of ischaemic cells changes, allowing current to flow between the ischaemic and nonischaemic regions, which generates ST <b>segment</b> <b>shift.</b> The ischaemic regions included in the model were those measured using fluorescent microspheres in a sheep model, and the transmembrane potentials were generated from values extracted from the literature. Subendocardial ischaemia in the territory supplied by either the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) or left circumflex coronary artery (LOX) was simulated, showing that the current source is produced at the ischaemic boundary, with the positive source at the ischaemic and the negative source at the normal side of the boundary. At the intramural boundary, the current flow is highly localised around the boundary, while at the lateral boundary normal to the endocardium, current flows both by crossing the boundary and through the intracavity blood. Epicardial ST depression is seen over the lateral boundary while endocardial ST elevation appears over the ischaemic region. The source in the septum is not seen on the epicardium because it is surrounded by highly conductive blood. LAD and LCX ischaemia share the lateral boundary and produce a similar pattern of epicardial ST depression on the left free wall. Transmural ischaemia of varying size was studied. Transmural ischaemia of a small region produces localised ST elevation over the ischaemic region with little ST depression elsewhere on the epicardium and a similar pattern on the endocardium with a much lower amplitude. Ischaemia in either the LAD or LCX territory produces a strong dipole on the epicardium over the left lateral region, with ST elevation on the ischaemic region and ST depression on the nonischaemic region. ST depression in transmural ischaemia is generated with ST elevation and {{is an integral part of}} the source, thus it is inevitable that ST depression on the body surface will be generated during ischaemia of a large region of myocardium. The effect of the myocardial anisotropy on ST potentials was also studied. The inclusion of myocardial anisotropy produces results somewhat closer to measured results in animal models. In conclusion, the bidomain model is successful in modelling the ST potential and the simulation in this study successfully explains the observations of ST <b>segment</b> <b>shift</b> during myocardial ischaemia. It provides useful guidance for the clinical interpretation of ST <b>segment</b> <b>shift...</b>|$|R

The ratio of ST <b>segment</b> <b>shift</b> to baseline ORS amplitude (ST/O) was computed for the Laplacian electrodes and the standard 12 leads. Defining ST/O = 0. 1 to be the minimum significant ST shift, Laplacian maps in all six patients revealed a significant ST shift during balloon inflation while the 12 lead ECG revealed a significant 5 T shift in only three patients. The mean peak value of ST/O in the Laplacian maps was 0. 40 versus 0. 13 in the 12 lead ECG (p = 0. 01). Laplacian maps of ST/O showed localized elevation over the expected region of distribution of the occluded vessel, often surrounded by a region of negative ST/O. The unipolar leads revealed a diffuse bipolar pattern of ST <b>segment</b> <b>shift.</b> ConclusionBody surface Laplacian mapping may provide a sensitive and accurate noninvasive means of detecting and localizing cardiac ischemia, superior to the 12 lead ECG.
