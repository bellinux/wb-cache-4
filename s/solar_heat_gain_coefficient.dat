40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study investigating the energy performance of electrochromic windows in a prototypical residential building under a variety of state switching control strategies. We used the DOE- 2. 1 E energy simulation program to analyze the annual cooling energy and peak demand as a function of glazing type, size, and electrochromic control strategy. A single-story ranch-style home located in the cooling-dominated locations of Miami, FL and Phoenix, AZ was simulated. Electrochromic control strategies analyzed were based on incident total solar radiation, space cooling load, and outside air temperature. Our results show that an electrochromic material with a high reflectance in the colored state provides the best performance for all control strategies. On the other hand, electrochromic switching using space cooling load provides the best performance for all the electrochromic materials. The performance of the incident total solar radiation control strategy varies {{as a function of the}} values of solar radiation which trigger the bleached and colored states of the electrochromic (setpoint range); i. e., required cooling decreases as the setpoint range decreases; also, performance differences among electrochromics increases. The setpoint range of outside air temperature control of electrochromics must relate to the ambient weather conditions prevalent in a particular location. If the setpoint range is too large, electrochromic cooling performance is very poor. Electrochromics compare favorably to conventional low-E clear glazings that have high <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> <b>gain</b> <b>coefficients</b> that are used with overhangs. However, low-E tinted glazings with low <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> <b>gain</b> <b>coefficients</b> can outperform certain electrochromics.

In this paper, the proposed methodology is implemented in the Fener simulation engine and compared with EnergyPlus for systems for which the assumptions of the ISO 15099 model are valid. Then, the Fener program is used to simulate the thermal behaviour of a zone with a fenestration system that contains sawtooth-shaped retro-reflecting interior blinds, which cannot be directly modelled with the ISO 15099 model.

40|$|Double skin facade {{systems are}} known to be capable of {{preventing}} overheating in curtain wall buildings to a certain degree. The system induces the efficient blocking of sunlight using a center blind during the summer season. Moreover, it enables overheated air in the cavity layer to be sent outdoors, resulting in a reduction of the use of energy for cooling. However, double skin facade systems can be problematic, in that they must be opened according to seasonal conditions to achieve greater energy consumption efficiencies. In current double skin facade systems, the width of the cavity layer was too wide for residents to easily operate the system. When considering this, research on an easy-to-open 270 mm slim-type double skin window (SDSW) was undertaken in order to confirm its energy efficient performance.

Recently, models were developed for complex fenestration systems – glazing systems with attachments such as venetian blinds and insect screens.

The results of this tool provide interior glass surface temperature and transmitted solar radiation which link into comfort analysis inputs required by the ASHRAE Thermal Comfort Tool –V 2 (ASHRAE, 2011). This tool is a simple-to-use calculator providing the total solar heat gain of a glazing system exposed to various angles of solar incidence. Given basic climate (solar) data, as well as the orientation of the glazing under consideration the solar heat gain can be calculated. The calculation incorporates the <b>Solar</b> <b>Heat</b> <b>Gain</b> <b>Coefficient</b> function produced for the glazing system under various angles of solar incidence WINDOW 6. 0 (LBNL, 2001). The significance of this work rests in providing an orientation-based heat transfer calculator through an easy-to-use tool (using Microsoft EXCEL) for user inputs of climate and <b>Solar</b> <b>Heat</b> <b>Gain</b> <b>Coefficient</b> (WINDOW- 6) data.

40|$|THERM is a state-of-the-art, Microsoft Windows{trademark}-based {{computer}} program developed at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) {{for use by}} building component manufacturers, engineers, educators, students, architects, and others interested in heat transfer. Using THERM, you can model two-dimensional heat-transfer effects in building components such as windows, walls, foundations, roofs, and doors; appliances; and other products where thermal bridges are of concern. THERM's heat-transfer analysis allows you to evaluate a product's energy efficiency and local temperature patterns, which may relate directly to problems with condensation, moisture damage, and structural integrity. THERM's two-dimensional conduction heat-transfer analysis {{is based on the}} finite-element method, which can model the complicated geometries of building products. The program's graphic interface allows you to draw cross sections of products or components to be analyzed. To create the cross sections, you can trace imported files in DXF or bitmap format, or input the geometry from known dimensions. Each cross section is represented by a combination of polygons. You define the material properties for each polygon and introduce the environmental conditions to which the component is exposed by defining the boundary conditions surrounding the cross section. Once the model is created, the remaining analysis (mesher and heat transfer) is automatic. You can view results from THERM in several forms, including U-factors, isotherms, heat-flux vectors, and local temperatures. This version of THERM includes several new technical and user interface features; the most significant is a radiation view-factor algorithm. This feature increases the accuracy of calculations in situations where you are analyzing non-planar surfaces that have different temperatures and exchange energy through radiation heat transfer. This heat-transfer mechanism is important in greenhouse windows, hollow cavities, and some aluminum frames. THERM is a module of the WINDOW+ 5 program under development by LBNL.

40|$|In this paper, <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> <b>gain</b> through glass {{daylighting}} roof {{is deeply}} studied by theoretical calculation method, taking Guangzhou in the Hot Summer and Warm Winter (HSWW) zone as an example. The {{direct solar radiation}} is calculated by Bouguer formula whereas the diffuse solar radiation is calculated by Berlage formula, representing {{the basis for the}} calculation method of the solar radiation intensity through the glass daylighting roof. Through the establishment of solar radiation calculation model, the <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> <b>gain</b> of the commonly used glass types has been calculated and analyzed, especially comparatively analyzing of Low-E cored-glass with double-coated silver and 6 + 12 A+ 6 insulating glass. Then, comparison between <b>solar</b> <b>heat</b> <b>gain</b> as calculated and measured by field measurement tested the indoor <b>solar</b> radiation <b>heat</b> <b>gain</b> distribution by using adjacent rooms with different glass types in a hot summer area, with the aim of demonstrating the effectiveness of the model. The research in this paper is expected to further improve the calculation accuracy of both thermal load and indoor temperature...|$|R
