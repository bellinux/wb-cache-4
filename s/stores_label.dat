40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{framework}} for sharing text labels among photographs. Digital photographs are usually organized by text labeling {{in order to}} search and browse a collection. But, labeling many photographs costs users much effort. On the other hand, many kinds of spatial sensors including GPS have become popular today. We assume {{there will be many}} photographs with spatial metadata such as geographic coordinates of cameras positions and directions. We, therefore, suggest label sharing system for such photographs in this paper. The system (i) <b>stores</b> <b>label</b> data placed on photographs by a user, and (ii) computes geographic locations of objects in the real world pointed by stored labels. When a photograph requires label data, the system (iii) selects and shares all label data which are judged to be seen in the photograph by considering field of view (FOV) of the photograph. In this framework, label texts are placed on appropriate positions on photographs, and that makes photographs clickable when label data have URLs...|$|E
40|$|Graph-based Semi-supervised {{learning}} (SSL) algorithms {{have been}} successfully used in {{a large number of}} applications. These methods classify initially unlabeled nodes by propagating label information over the structure of graph starting from seed nodes. Graph-based SSL algorithms usually scale linearly with the number of distinct labels (m), and require O(m) space on each node. Unfortunately, there exist many applications of practical significance with very large m over large graphs, demanding better space and time complexity. In this paper, we propose MAD-SKETCH, a novel graph-based SSL algorithm which compactly <b>stores</b> <b>label</b> distribution on each node using Count-min Sketch, a randomized data structure. We present theoretical analysis showing that under mild conditions, MAD-SKETCH can reduce space complexity at each node from O(m) to O(log m), and achieve similar savings in time complexity as well. We support our analysis through experiments on multiple real world datasets. We observe that MAD-SKETCH achieves similar performance as existing state-of-the-art graph- based SSL algorithms, while requiring smaller memory footprint {{and at the same time}} achieving up to 10 x speedup. We find that MAD-SKETCH is able to scale to datasets with one million labels, which is beyond the scope of existing graph- based SSL algorithms. Comment: 9 page...|$|E

5000|$|One of {{his most}} {{significant}} innovations was the [...] "band within a band" [...] concept, recording small groups to record hot small group sides for the various dime <b>store</b> <b>labels.</b> He started this in 1928 by arranging for members of Ben Pollack's band to make records under a bewildering array of pseudonyms on dime <b>store</b> <b>labels</b> — like Banner, Oriole, Cameo, Domino, and Perfect — while Pollack had an exclusive contract with Victor. Quite {{a number of these}} dime store small group records are considered major jazz classics by collectors. He printed [...] "small orchestrations" [...] transcribed off the record, so that non-professional musicians could see how great solos were constructed. This was later done by Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw, and several other bands.|$|R

50|$|Between early 1932 and 1939, Brunswick was ARC's {{flagship}} label, {{selling for}} 75 cents, {{while all of}} the other ARC labels were selling for 35 cents. Best selling artists during that time were Bing Crosby, the Boswell Sisters, the Mills Brothers, Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway, Abe Lyman, Casa Loma Orchestra, Leo Reisman, Ben Bernie, and Anson Weeks. Many of these artists moved over to Decca in late 1934, causing Brunswick to reissue popular records by these artists on the ARC dime <b>store</b> <b>labels</b> as a means to compete with Decca's 35 cent price.|$|R
50|$|From about 1928, with {{involvement}} from Irving Mills, {{members of}} Pollack's band moonlighted at Plaza-ARC and recorded a vast quantity of hot dance and jazz for their dime <b>store</b> <b>labels</b> — Banner, Perfect, Domino, Cameo, Lincoln, Romeo — under the names Mills' Merry Makers, Goody's Good Timers, Kentucky Grasshoppers, Mills' Musical Clowns, The Lumberjacks, Dixie Daises, The Caroliners, The Whoopee Makers, The Hotsy Totsy Gang, Dixie Jazz Band, and Jimmy Bracken's Toe Ticklers. Combining Pollack's regular recordings with these side groups made Pollack's {{one of the}} more prolific bands of the 1920s and 1930s.|$|R
50|$|As the Depression and the {{popularity}} of radio cut into record sales, most of the <b>store</b> <b>labels</b> were discontinued; another factor was that the younger record buyers looked for specific versions of their favorite tunes, so name artists like Glenn Miller and Benny Goodman made {{up the majority of}} discs sold. The last Oriole records seem to have been issued in January, 1937. All of the low-priced labels were dropped in April, 1938 and the American Record Corporation was acquired by the Columbia Broadcasting System later that year.|$|R
50|$|The {{algorithm}} continues this way, {{and creates}} new region labels whenever necessary. The {{key to a}} fast algorithm, however, is how this merging is done. This algorithm uses the union-find data structure which provides excellent performance for keeping track of equivalence relationships. Union-find essentially <b>stores</b> <b>labels</b> which correspond to the same blob in a disjoint-set data structure, {{making it easy to}} remember the equivalence of two labels by the use of an interface method E.g.: findSet(l). findSet(l) returns the minimum label value that is equivalent to the function argument 'l'.|$|R
50|$|In 1930, Cab Calloway and His Orchestra {{was hired}} to replace Duke Ellington at the Cotton Club, and {{recorded}} for Brunswick and the ARC dime <b>store</b> <b>labels</b> (Banner, Cameo, Conqueror, Perfect, Melotone, Banner, Oriole, etc.) from 1930-1932. In 1932, he signed with Victor for a year, but he was back on Brunswick in late 1934 through 1936, when he signed with manager Irving Mills's short-lived Variety in 1937, and stayed with Mills when the label collapsed and the sessions were continued on Vocalion through 1939, and then OKeh Records through 1942.|$|R
5000|$|Kaufman began {{recording}} in 1914, {{and recorded}} for Victor, Columbia, Vocalion, Gennett, Edison, Harmony, {{as well as}} all of the dime labels (Banner, Perfect, etc.).

Sometimes, {{as in the case of}} several of his 1927 [...] "Broadway Bell-Hops" [...] vocals, he was merely credited as [...] "Vocal Chorus". He was often credited as [...] "vocal refrain by George Beaver" [...] on the dime <b>store</b> <b>labels.</b>|$|R
40|$|Eye {{movements}} made by listeners during language-mediated visual search {{reveal a}} strong link between visual processing and conceptual processing. For example, upon hearing {{the word for}} a missing referent with a characteristic colour (e. g., “strawberry”), listeners tend to fixate a colour-matched distractor (e. g., a red plane) more than a colour-mismatched distractor (e. g., a yellow plane). We ask whether these shifts in visual attention are mediated by the retrieval of lexically <b>stored</b> colour <b>labels.</b> Do children who do not yet possess verbal labels for the colour attribute that spoken and viewed objects have in common exhibit language-mediated eye movements like those made by older children and adults? That is, do toddlers look at a red plane when hearing “strawberry”? We observed that 24 -montholds lacking colour term knowledge nonetheless recognized the perceptual–conceptual commonality between named and seen objects. This indicates that language-mediated visual search need not depend on <b>stored</b> <b>labels</b> for concepts...|$|R
