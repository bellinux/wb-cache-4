40|$|Abstract Fe 2 O 3 coated plate mica(Fe 2 O 3 /mica) for {{infrared}} reflectance red pigment was prepared under hydrothermal treatment. Fe 2 O 3 was perfectly coated on mica via {{the difference of}} surface charge between Fe 2 O 3 and mica particles at pH 3. Fe 2 O 3 /mica was then calcined at 800 oC to stabilize the coated layer on mica. The infrared(IR) reflectance pigments were characterized by X-ray diffraction, FE-SEM, zeta potential, and a UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer. In particular, the CIE color coordinate and IR reflectance properties of Fe 2 O 3 /mica pigments were investigated {{in relation to the}} thickness variation of the Fe 2 O 3 layer coated on mica of various lateral sizes. The isolation-heat red paints containing the pigments were prepared and optimized with a thinner, <b>settling</b> <b>agent,</b> and dispersant. Then, the films were made. The thermal property of isolation-heat on these films was observed through the relationship of the IR reflectance value, which was based on the variation of the Fe 2 O 3 layer’s thickness coated on mica and mica’s lateral size as IR reflectance pigment. With an increase in IR reflectance on these films, the thermal property of isolation-heat was effectively enhanced.

40|$|Abstract The {{impacts of}} {{sprinkler}} irrigation on infiltration, runoff and sediment loss of ten representative soils of Southern Portugal were assessed by laboratory sprinkler irrigation simulation tests. All soils showed very low permeability to applied water. The mechanical impact of water droplets enhanced soil dispersion and further lowered their infiltration capacity, particularly for high clay plus silt content soils {{that showed the}} poorest results. As a consequence, high runoff and sediment losses were also measured, primarily with the first irrigation. More moderate losses were observed thereafter. Soils with higher sand particle size fractions better absorbed the energy impact of droplets and showed higher infiltration rates and lower runoff and sediment losses. Polyacrylamide (PAM) applied to the soils through the irrigation water acted as a binding and <b>settling</b> <b>agent</b> to increase soils aggregate stability and infiltration and reduce runoff and sediment losses. Slope increase, from 2 · 5 to 5 %, decreased overall soils infiltration by 7 % and increased runoff and sediment losses by 10 and 27 %, respectively. Exposed to the same change in slope, PAM application boosted overall infiltration of treated soils to a 24 % difference and increased runoff by only 10 %. It had a less positive effect on sediment loss, the 5 % slope being responsible for a 52 % increase. In agreement with this the tests showed that, compared to the control, exposure of PAM-treated soil on 2 · 5 and 5 % slopes enhanced overall infiltration to 457 and 642 % respectively, reduced runoff by 25 % on both cases and lessened sediment loss by 39 and 27 %. The demonstrated ability of PAM to influence surface soil conditions of specific soils {{can be used to}} reduce the environmental risks associated with the intensive use of sprinkler irrigation in Southern Portugal. It offers a safe, practical and non-intrusive management alternative to current costly, labour- and energy-intensive practices of increasing the number of machine turns and building storage basins to control runoff and soil erosion...|$|E

In this paper, I advance two linked arguments against agency incompatibilism. I argue, first, that we do not exercise direct control over the fine-grained aspects of our movements. Rather, we control these movements indirectly, by intentionally engaging in broadly individuated action types (regarding which Steward concedes that the compatibilist has a plausible story to tell). Second, I argue that these aspects of our movements are lucky for us and, since this is true, they cannot play the role of grounding our agency. 14 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This {{doctoral}} research aims {{to contribute}} to the academic debate about whether and how evaluation is fostering the environmental democratization of urban governance in the European Union. The dissertation starts with identifying a long-lasting intellectual stalemate regarding the extent to which democratic forms of governance are able to address and tackle major environmental issues. It is argued that, once civil and political rights have been secured in a society (and that is the case in the chosen research context), democratization may further advance in terms of authentic political participation of different groups, and the coming under public scrutiny of previously neglected issues. Although these advancements may well occur within the state, a wider perspective on the polity in general may highlight emerging spaces of democratization at the crossroads where representative and non-elected authorities, civil society and market actors meet up. Environmental democratization is defined as a progress along three complementary processes: increasing franchise, expanding scope, and fostering authenticity. Three key environmental issues (namely voicing non-human <b>agents,</b> <b>settling</b> on the distribution of environmental pros and cons, and coping with socially disrupting risks) cut across environmental democratization processes. A mixed conception of democracy, both procedural and substantive, underpins the resulting model. As for evaluation, current environmental assessment systems are first reviewed to point to both strengths an...|$|R

In 1859, however, emigration dropped off with only 16 vessels arriving from Norway carrying 1,756 passengers. Of the over 28,460 Norwegians who came to Canada in the 1850s it is estimated that only 400 remained in Canada the majority moved on into the American west. A small settlement of Norwegians was begun at Gaspe Peninsula, Lower Canada, in 1854. A report in 1859, stated that 25 families, totaling 126 persons, were settled in the Gaspe.

Small scale vinification of these grapes was performed and the OA content at various stages was analysed.

Shiraz must was vinified by either static or rotary fermentation. No differences in the OA content of wine after pressing were noted. OA was concentrated in juice lees and gross lees. However, additional juice or wine recovered from lees after centrifugation did not display increased OA contamination compared to racked juice or wine. Addition of bentonite at 2. 5 g/L to a Semillon wine containing 56 mg grape-derived protein/L and ca. 8 μg OA/kg resulted in a 67 % reduction in OA concentration.
