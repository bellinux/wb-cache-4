40|$|Some <b>social</b> <b>choice</b> <b>models</b> {{assume that}} precise {{interpersonal}} comparisons of utility (either ordinal or cardinal) are possible, allowing a rich theory of distributive justice. Other models assume that absolutely no interpersonal comparisons are possible, or even meaningful; hence all Pareto-efficient outcomes are equally socially desirable. We compromise {{between these two}} extremes, by developing a model of `approximate' interpersonal comparisons of well-being, {{in terms of an}} incomplete preorder on the space of psychophysical states. We then define and characterize `approximate' versions of the classical egalitarian and utilitarian social welfare orderings. We show that even very weak assumptions about interpersonal comparability can yield preorders on the space of social alternatives which, while incomplete, are far more complete than the Pareto preorder (e. g. they select relatively small subsets of the Pareto frontier as being `socially optimal'). Along the way, we give sufficient conditions for an incomplete preorder to be representable using a collection of utility functions. We also develop a variant of Harsanyi's Social Aggregation Theorem. ...|$|R

40|$|We ask in {{this paper}} about the effect on social {{decisions}} of limiting the size of changes that voters may propose each time in an otherwise standard dynamic <b>social</b> <b>choice</b> <b>model.</b> The voting rule we study {{can be seen as}} an extension of Bowen's dynamic "majority voting" rule, and is closely related to the dynamic procedures for public good allocation in the literature (DrÉze and de la VallÊe Poussin 1971; Malinvaud 1971; Laffont and Maskin 1983; Chander 1993). Under general assumptions we prove existence and Pareto efficiency of equilibrium, and show that our rule motivates voters not to misrepresent preferences (more precisely, the rule is Strongly Locally Individually Incentive Compatible). Under Euclidean preferences we find that electoral cycles do not arise (i. e., the rule is convergent), that there is a unique equilibrium, and that the equilibrium coincides with the solution to an old problem of geometry, first addressed by Fermat, Torricelli, and Cavallieri. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} model of {{collective}} decision making in which voting and deliberation are treated simultaneously. Political theorists argue that public discussion can lead individuals to change their preferences. This aspect of democracy is typically ignored in models of social choice that focus exclusively on voting. In our model, individuals debate in a public forum and potentially revise their preferences in light of deliberation. Once this process is exhausted, a voting rule is applied to aggregate post-deliberation preferences into a social choice. Restricting attention to three alternatives, we identify conditions under which a democracy is truth-revealing {{in the sense that}} the deliberation path and the voting rule will always lead to the correct social choice being made, irrespective of the original profile of preferences and size of the electorate (provided the latter is finite). A critical parameter in the model is the persuasion cost. When this is low, a democracy is almost always truth-revealing. When it is high, we have the standard <b>social</b> <b>choice</b> <b>model</b> and truthful revelation is impossible. Moreover, we identify when and only when truthful revelation occurs in an interesting intermediate case...|$|E
40|$|PV-optimality in a capital-resource {{economy can}} imply {{decreasing}} utility over {{some portion of}} the time horizon. Various criteria have been proposed to maintain intergenerational equity defined as nondeclining utility, but these have some limitations and problems. This paper proposes a new welfare criteria incorporating present value to maintain efficiency, and an equity function with convex costs on declining utility. This criterion is economically efficient, time-consistent and recursive. An extension of dynamic programming to multiple value functions is developed to solve this problem. Increasing the equity weight increasingly eliminates declining portions of utility time paths. Sustainability implies increasing consumption in the early time periods and some intermediate time periods relative to PV-optimality. A surprising result is that sustainability can actually result in increased resource usage in early time periods, followed later by higher levels of resource stocks compared to PV-optimality. The sustainability analysis shows that while conventional benefit-cost and valuation analysis contribute to efficiency, they do not necessarily induce sustainability due to incorrect dynamic GE prices. Similar comments apply to Green NNP analysis. The concepts and extended DP methods developed in this paper extend naturally to uncertainty and can also be applied to generalized consumer and <b>social</b> <b>choice</b> <b>models</b> beyond those typically considered in the literature. growth, environment, intergenerational equity, dynamic programming, Research Methods/ Statistical Methods,...|$|R
40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>choice</b> <b>models</b> usually {{assume that}} choice is among pre-defined, uni-dimensional and “simple ” objects. Very often, on the contrary, choice is among multifeatured and “complex ” objects: a {{candidate}} in an election stands for an electoral programme which is a complex bundle of many interdependent political positions {{on a wide variety}} of issues. Also in committees and organizations of various sorts collective choices are most often made among policy “bundles ” and authorities can act upon the pre-choice stage of construction of such bundles. This pre-choice power of alternatives construction may grant authorities a highly effective device to influence the outcome of <b>social</b> <b>choice</b> even when the latter is totally free and democratic. In this paper we propose a model which investigates within a simple majority vote framework the role of the object construction power, an analogous to the agenda power. Even when object construction is simply defined as the possibility of assembling and dis-assembling a fixed set of choice components into bundles, we show that, under rather general condition, it can radically change the outcome of the majority voting process. In particular we show that any set of bundles (that we call “choice modules”) is associated to a set of possible social outcomes which can be attained depending upon the initial conditions. Moreover we shows that also Condorcet-Arrow cycles can appear or disappear depending upon which set of modules is chosen.

40|$|One test {{of whether}} a {{scholarly}} work has achieved canonical status is to ask respected scholars in the field which works, setting aside their own, are essential reads. William Fletcher’s article, The Structure of Standing, now in its twenty-fifth year, would almost certainly emerge {{at the top of}} any such lists among standing scholars. And yet, while many at this conference have built upon Fletcher’s insights, there remains notable disagreement concerning standing doctrine’s normative foundations. The central dispute concerns whether standing doctrine should be celebrated as furthering a “private-rights,” or instead, condemned as thwarting a “public-rights,” adjudicatory model. In a series of works employing social choice theory, I have presented standing doctrine as furthering a private-rights adjudicatory model. In separate high-profile works, Professors Heather Elliott and Jonathan Siegel have criticized this account, claiming it rests on the “great myth” that the judicial lawmaking is inextricably tied to dispute resolution, with precedent creation merely an incidental byproduct. Instead, Elliott and Siegel contend that the federal judiciary, including especially the Supreme Court, has the primary responsibility of announcing constitutional rules, with case resolutions a justificatory vehicle for performing that task. Siegel further maintains that if, as the <b>social</b> <b>choice</b> <b>model</b> suggests, standing raises the cost to ideological litigants of timing the path of case law to influence developing doctrine, it is no more effective than tossing a “few grains of sand” into the gears of the judicial-lawmaking apparatus. In this Article I respond to these critiques and defend the social choice analysis of standing and the private-rights model on which it rests. First, these and other public-rights scholars fail to appreciate that the private-rights model enhances the normative legitimacy and durability of precedent. If the justification for creating precedent is the present favorable conditions of judicial staffing, then the arguments for respecting the resulting precedent erode when those conditions change, favoring those opposing the precedent. Second, these critiques misread the <b>social</b> <b>choice</b> <b>model</b> of standing to imply that relaxing its limiting conditions undermines the claim that with reasonable assumptions, even if there are no changes in Supreme Court staffing, in the disposition of cases below, in intervening precedent, and in the jurisprudential views of sitting justices, ideological litigants can effect substantive doctrine through favorable case orderings. The opposite is true: Relaxing these limiting conditions has the potential to enhance, not diminish, incentives to manipulate case orderings for maximal doctrinal effect. Third, and finally, expanding the social choice analysis to account for (1) delays in lower federal courts or state courts, (2) the results of changed judicial staffing on the Supreme Court, and (3) the bidirectional nature of constitutional and prudential standing rules more likely generates a butterfly effect, with substantial implications for developing doctrine, than an inconsequential tossing of sand into the works of developing precedent...|$|E
40|$|In {{the short}} span of eight years, the Supreme Court has issued two {{seemingly}} opposite {{answers to the}} question of whether Congress has free reign to provide private citizens with standing to redress violations of federal environmental law, when those violations have not produced any discernible harm to the claimants. In his prior scholarship, Professor Maxwell Stearns has developed a model of standing based upon the theory of social choice, which focuses primarily upon constitutional standing rules. The recent doctrinal transformation from Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, to Friends of the Earth v. Laidlaw Environmental Services, Inc., has provided a valuable opportunity for Professor Stearns to expand his <b>social</b> <b>choice</b> <b>model</b> and to apply it in the context of statutory standing. In this article, which develops a preliminary model of environmental standing, Professor Stearns considers how bargaining over standing expands the issue spectrum for legislative bargaining as it affects the optimal compliance level under a proposed environmental statute. He then considers the differential signaling value of a citizen suit versus agency enforcement as a proxy for the optimal compliance level of the median member of the enacting Congress. The model of statutory standing, which grows out of this analysis, provides several valuable insights into recent environmental standing cases, and suggests a plausible means of reconciling Lujan and Laidlaw...|$|E

40|$|Understanding the {{determinants}} of activities and travel is critical for transportation policymakers, planners, and engineers to design and manage transportation systems. These systems, and their externalities, are interwoven with social systems in communities, cities, regions, and societies. But discrete <b>choice</b> <b>models</b> - the predominant modeling tool for researching travel behavior and planning transportation systems - are grounded in theories of individual decision-making. This dissertation expands knowledge about the incorporation of social interactions into activity-travel <b>choice</b> <b>models</b> {{in the areas of}} social capital and social network indicators; social influence motivations and informational conformity; and misspecification errors from social network data collection. Incorporating social capital into activity <b>choice</b> <b>models</b> involves using <b>social</b> capital indicators from surveys. Using a position generator question type, the role of social network occupational diversity in activity participation was explored and the performance of models using name generator and position generator data was compared. Access to the resources embedded in diverse networks (extensity) was found to positively correlate with leisure activity participation. Compared to core network indicators from name generators, position generator indicators were typically better at predicting activity participation in a cross-validation study. Current models of social influence in travel do not account for varying motivations for social influence such as for accuracy, affiliation, and self-concept. To test for an accuracy motivation, a latent class discrete <b>choice</b> <b>model</b> was formulated that places individuals into classes based on information exposure. Contrasting with existing work, this model showed that "more informed" households are more likely to own bicycles due to preference changes causing less sensitivity to smaller home footprints and limited incomes.

40|$|The primary {{research}} {{aim of this}} dissertation is to identify the strategies that best meet the information retrieval needs as expressed in the 2 ̆ 2 e-discovery 2 ̆ 2 scenario. This task calls for a high-recall system that, {{in response to a}} request for all available relevant documents to a legal complaint, effectively prioritizes documents from an enterprise document collection in order of likelihood of relevance. High recall information retrieval strategies, such as those employed for e-discovery and patent or medical literature searches, reflect high costs when relevant documents are missed, but they also carry high document review costs. Our approaches parallel the evaluation opportunities afforded by the TREC Legal Track. Within the ad hoc framework, we propose an approach that includes query field selection, techniques for mitigating OCR error, term weighting strategies, query language reduction, pseudo-relevance feedback using document metadata and terms extracted from documents, merging result sets, and biasing results to favor documents responsive to lawyer-negotiated queries. We conduct several experiments to identify effective parameters for each of these strategies. Within the relevance feedback framework, we use an active learning approach informed by signals from collected prior relevance judgments and ranking data. We train a classifier to prioritize the unjudged documents retrieved using different ad hoc information retrieval techniques applied to the same topic. We demonstrate significant improvements over heuristic rank aggregation strategies when choosing from a relatively small pool of documents. With a larger pool of documents, we validate the effectiveness of the merging strategy as a means to increase recall, but that sparseness of judgment data prevents effective ranking by the classifier-based ranker. We conclude our research by optimizing the classifier-based ranker and applying it to other high recall datasets. Our concluding experiments consider the potential benefits to be derived by modifying the merged runs using methods derived from <b>social</b> <b>choice</b> <b>models.</b> We find that this technique, Local Kemenization, is hampered by the large number of documents and the minimal number of contributing result sets to the ranked list.

The ethical assessment indicates that: 1. safety/effectiveness profile of treatment is guaranteed if its use is restricted to the patients subgroups who may benefit; 2. patients should be carefully informed, particularly in treatment deferral, and widespread information on these therapies should be implemented; 3. since treatment was proven to be cost-effective, its use is acceptable in respect of the resource macro-allocation. Concerning individual (micro-) allocation criteria: a. criteria for eligibility to treatment should be clearly identified and updated periodically; b. information on criteria for eligibility/deferral to treatment for specific patients subgroups should be made widely known. Interferon-based regimens will disappear from use within the next year, {{with the arrival of}} highly effective/ tolerable combination regimens of direct-acting antiviral, profoundly changing the <b>social</b> <b>choices.</b> Our <b>model</b> could nonetheless support future ethical assessment, since the evaluation pertaining ethical domain remains applicable overall...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} sports participation upon the subjective well‐being of individuals. Encouraging participation in sports activity is now an important public policy issue, as {{it is argued that}} there are benefits in terms of health and well‐being to individuals as well as to society through externalities. Controlling for personal and socio‐demographic characteristics affecting well‐being, this paper examines if participation in, and the frequency and duration of, 67 sports activities affects well‐being. The form in which sports participation takes place is also investigated by examining if social‐interaction sports produce more well‐being. This paper demonstrates that sports participation has a positive affect upon the subjective well‐being of the population and, moreover, estimates its monetary value. The effects are larger if one allows for <b>social</b> interactions. ordered <b>choice</b> <b>model,</b> heterogeneous thresholds, happiness, sports, willingness to pay measures, C 25, I 31, D 31, J 12,...|$|R
