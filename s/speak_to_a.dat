5|$|In 1927, Rashid al-Haj Ibrahim, {{the leader}} of the Young Men's Muslim Association of Haifa, a {{prominent}} merchant, and future associate of Darwaza, invited him to his home to <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> large group of students and notables about nationalist (qawmiyya) and patriotic (wataniyya) education. This was recognition that Darwaza's contribution to the spread of Arab nationalist sentiments gained influence not only in an-Najah School, but throughout Palestine.|$|E
5|$|On February 21, 1965, in Manhattan's Audubon Ballroom, MalcolmX {{began to}} <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{meeting of the}} Organization of Afro-American Unity when a {{disturbance}} {{broke out in the}} crowd of 400. As MalcolmX and his bodyguards moved to quiet the disturbance, a man rushed forward and shot Malcolm in the chest with a sawed-off shotgun. Two other men charged the stage and fired handguns, hitting MalcolmX 16 times.|$|E
5|$|Angel {{finds that}} he cannot {{stop talking about}} his divorce when trying to meet new women at a bar. After he meets a woman {{recovering}} from her own divorce, he has to leave her to <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> prostitute whom he sees across {{the room with a}} prosthetic hand and fingernails painted {{in the same way as}} the Ice Truck Killer's first victim. Working on a hunch that the Ice Truck Killer is an acrotomophiliac, Angel decides to speak to Debra's boyfriend, Rudy Cooper, a prosthetics specialist and (unbeknownst to anyone else) the actual Ice Truck Killer. Rudy cooperates with the interview upon realizing that Angel does not know his identity. Later, Angel is stabbed in a parking lot by a masked man. Angel manages to elbow him in the face before two men scare the attacker off. Minutes later, Rudy - who had earlier fallen out with Debra due to secretly having dinner with Dexter - arrives with flowers. They kiss, but Rudy backs away complaining of a cut lip, suggesting that he was Angel's attacker.|$|E

5|$|Black {{tracks the}} history of the second kidnapper, finding that he was {{involved}} in a military medical group; Swan's name is also associated with this group. As Black is investigating, Watts approaches him, showing him a second photograph of Taylor, now looking sickly, beside the canister. Watts believes she has less than two days to live. Meanwhile, Hollis has discovered that Swan frequently called Art Bell's Coast to Coast AM radio show under a pseudonym to discuss conspiracy theories about Gulf War syndrome. Bell invites Black onto the show to <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> listening Swan; the two realise that Black's wife was killed by a pathogen Swan was ordered to test on his troops during the Gulf War—an order which came from a group outside of the Army.|$|E
5|$|Dan's {{health is}} {{determined}} by a health bar, which reduces when Dan is hit. It will deplete completely if Dan drowns or falls from a great height. If Dan runs out of health, the game will end. Dan can extend his maximum health by collecting Life Bottles, which will automatically refill his health bar if it drops to zero. Also hidden throughout the game are Life Vials and Life Fountains that replenish Dan's health and fill any empty Life Bottles Dan has. In each level, there is a hidden Chalice of Souls, which can be collected if the player dispatches enough enemies (some Chalices are awarded via other means). If the player clears a level with a Chalice in hand, Dan is warped to the Hall of Heroes, where he can <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> hero who will give him rewards, such as weapons. If the player finishes the game with all the Chalices, the true ending is revealed.|$|E
5|$|In a {{checkout}} line, Veronica and Mac (Tina Majorino) {{discuss her}} relationship with Piz and what her FBI internship will mean for them. They then see someone getting arrested by the campus police for a fake debit card. Weevil injures himself, but finds himself unable to receive adequate benefits. Veronica gets Piz to accept her leaving for the internship. At the Sheriff’s station, Weevil is called out by several students as being the one who gave them the fake cards. Weevil is put in the jail cell, but he tells Veronica that he think they targeted him after he was showcased in the criminology class. She investigates several of {{the owners of the}} student IDs, who do seem genuine in accusing Weevil. Weevil gets bail, but Keith informs him that a student ID printing machine was found in the locker next to Weevil’s. Veronica and Wallace <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> mechanical engineering professor, who says that it would be impossible for Weevil to be the culprit. Piz invites Keith to appear on his show in an election special before Keith informs Veronica that Weevil’s fingerprints were found all over the investigation.|$|E

5|$|The Federation {{starship}} Enterprise, {{under the}} command of Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), brings aboard the elderly Admiral Mark Jameson and his wife Anne (Marsha Hunt) on request of Karnas (Michael Pataki), the Governor of Mordan IV. Karnas warns that a dissident terrorist group has taken a Federation Ambassador and his staff hostage, and demand to <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> negotiator. Jameson had negotiated a previous settlement on Mordan IV. As the ship travels to Mordan IV, they find that Jameson is becoming stronger and more able to move about on his own, and is no longer showing signs of the terminal Iverson's Disease he was known to have before he was beamed aboard. The crew discovers that Jameson has been taking an array of drugs to reverse the aging process over the last two years, and only recently has taken an overdose of the drugs to prepare himself for the negotiations. Jameson begins to appear younger and full of energy, but has frequent pains {{as a result of the}} overdose. By the time they are nearing Mordan, Jameson now appears as a young adult.|$|E
5|$|Thomas filmed a twelve-minute teaser for his {{new concept}} and {{presented}} it to The CW. The teaser was later released on the Veronica Mars third season DVD and the internet. The clip begins in medias res with Veronica, {{pretending to be a}} high schooler, talking to a teacher. The teaser flashes back to her first FBI meeting, and the viewers discover that she is investigating the teacher for sexual abuse allegations. She successfully catches the teacher on camera, and at the FBI, she runs into a former acquaintance named Seth. She investigates a potential bomber with another novice agent, and they <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> man who appears to be innocent. However, he points a gun at Veronica's partner as the clip ends.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to therapy for the child, or even instead of it, children may benefit if their parents <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> therapist, take parenting classes, attend grief counseling, or take other actions to resolve stressful situations {{that affect the}} child. Parent management training is a highly effective form of psychotherapy that teaches parents skills to reduce their child's behavior problems.|$|E

Allegations against the hospital were directed at the examining nurse who allegedly fabricated statements concerning the initial medical examination, her supervisor (who adopted those statements {{even though they were}} contrary to the examination), and the failure of the Hospital to supervise these employees.|$|E

25|$|The western yellowjacket {{is often}} a pest to humans. As outdoor human {{activity}} has increased, so, too, has the nuisance of V. pensylvanica. Concentrated garbage has become an alternative food supply, and colonies have emerged in and around areas of human impact, such as recreational parks and resorts. Though they tend not to sting unless a violent struggle occurs, they nonetheless violently protect their nests and can sting repeatedly. As a result, increased efforts into pest control have occurred. Because the chance of colony disturbance and resulting stings is great, the species is recommended to be controlled during outbreaks. The recommended treatment of stings is antihistamine ointments and tablets to reduce reactions. Those who are highly sensitive or allergic to stings should <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> physician about alternatives such as emergency kits with premeasured doses of epinephrine or desensitization procedures.|$|E
25|$|One of Raj's biggest {{personality}} quirks is his {{tendency to}} speak or act inappropriately, often landing him in trouble or {{leading to an}} angry reaction from whomever he has upset. This was particularly pronounced when he was {{under the influence of}} alcohol, which could cause a catch-22, since for years he needed alcohol to even <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> woman, but the alcohol led to him say the wrong things. On one occasion, just as Leonard and Penny are about to have sex in their hotel room, Raj enters and obliviously proceeds to climb into Sheldon's recently vacated bed, completely unaware of what he has interrupted. On another occasion, he openly discussed having had crushes on Penny and Bernadette directly in front of them, which caused both discomfort, and unwittingly hurting Amy's feelings when he admits that he never had a crush on her as well (despite Penny and Bernadette's best efforts to alert him to this fact).|$|E
25|$|LucasArts' {{previous}} graphic adventure, Sam & Max Hit the Road (1993), {{introduced a}} new inventory and interaction system to replace those of their prior games, which had taken up the lower third of the player's screen. Full Throttle continued to refine on the changes introduced in Sam & Max Hit the Road: Objects or characters with which Ben can interact are indicated by a red square appearing around the cursor's crosshairs when the cursor is placed over the object. When this occurs, holding down the left mouse button causes a contextual pie menu {{to appear in the}} shape of the emblem of Ben's biker gang: a flaming circle topped by a skull and flanked by a boot and a gloved hand. The player hovers the cursor over elements of the emblem and then releases the mouse button to attempt various interactions with the object; for example, selecting the skull's mouth to <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> character, its eyes to examine an object, or the hand to pick up, use, or pull the object. Right-clicking anywhere on the screen brings up the player's inventory of collected objects, which can be examined or dragged and dropped in order to use them with other items in the inventory or with objects or characters in the scene. These gameplay features would be further developed for The Curse of Monkey Island (1997).|$|E
