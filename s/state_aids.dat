40|$|One of the {{potential}} benefits of an economic approach to <b>State</b> <b>aid</b> control is to make relationships between the costs and the benefits of <b>State</b> <b>aid</b> more transparent and, by doing so, to provide guidance on how to focus <b>State</b> <b>aid</b> control efforts on those areas where the damage of <b>State</b> <b>aid</b> is the greatest. Where markets fail to deliver efficient outcomes, Government intervention, including the provision of <b>State</b> <b>aid,</b> can improve welfare. This is an accepted result in the economic literature. Many national or supra-national bodies do not provide a mechanism to monitor and discipline the <b>State</b> <b>aid</b> provided by its members.

40|$|European <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> {{control is}} {{currently}} at a turning point. The European Union and its member states are increasingly recognizing {{the need to}} rethink the balance between the various objectives of state intervention. Constraints on state budgets and concerns about the e¤ectiveness of <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> have increased the political pressure toward a more economic e¤ects-based approach in <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> and <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> control. Both at national and European level, the political mandate is for ‘‘less and better targeted <b>state</b> <b>aid.</b> ’’ 1 In this chapter we explore how increased reliance on economic insights in <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> con-trol can contribute toward enhancing the e¤ectiveness of <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> control. The economics of <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> control is related to several areas of economics: first, to public economics, since <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> {{is a form of}} public intervention in the economy; second, to the economics of com-petition, as <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> confers an advantage to some firms and thus has the potential to af-fect the competitive process; and third, to international trade theory, as <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> can a¤ect trading conditions. This latter aspect creates incentives for national governments to pursue national economic or political goals, which in turn provides a rationale for supranational (European) <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> control...|$|R

As a result, {{the number of}} Commission actions against Member States {{on the basis of}} fiscal <b>State</b> <b>aid</b> has increased in recent years, with some amazing results. It has also revealed overlap and concurrence, sometimes even contradiction between EU <b>State</b> <b>aid</b> law and other EU law affecting direct taxation. The author discusses four types of interaction/overlap between EU <b>State</b> <b>aid</b> law and other areas of (EU) (soft) law affecting direct taxation: - <b>State</b> <b>aid</b> and free movement rights; - <b>State</b> <b>aid</b> and harmful tax competition; - <b>State</b> <b>aid</b> and anti-abuse measures; and - <b>State</b> <b>aid</b> in the form of taxation itself. His conclusions are that (i) <b>State</b> <b>aid</b> is marching on the field of taxation; (ii) the Code of Conduct Group is marching on the field of tax disparities and therefore on tax harmonization; and (iii) the criteria for assessing fiscal restrictions on free movement rights, fiscal <b>State</b> <b>aid</b> and harmful tax competition are converging, resulting in more overlap between the three sets of rules...|$|R

40|$|According to the European Union {{point of}} view, the {{fundamental}} principle of <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> {{is to ensure}} that inside the single market, competition is not distorted. In this context, by exception <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> can be justified when they contribute to achieving EU's social and economic goals. This may take place when market forces obstruct the achieving of the proposed objectives or permit their achieving on unacceptable long terms and costs. This article is structured in four parts, focusing on European Union's vision regarding <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> measures. The first part of the article refers to the general context of <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> in EU. The second part of the article tries to define this concept according to European Commission point of view and also studies the <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> information provided by the EU, through its benchmarking instrument regarding <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> expenditure called <b>State</b> <b>Aid</b> Scoreboard. The third part of the article mainly presents the EU <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> evolution during the period 2007 - 2012 and establishes a methodological point of view in order to classify and divide <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> in two main categories: non-crisis <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> and crisis <b>state</b> <b>aid,</b> with the purpose of avoiding the distortion trends regarding <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> expenditure granted for the financial sector.

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} the economic significance of <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> {{and the main}} principles of European <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> control. It starts with a definition of <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> in European context and exceptions to the general ban of <b>state</b> <b>aid.</b> Then they are explored the motives for granting <b>state</b> <b>aid,</b> ranging from the correction of market failures over political motives to political economy considerations. They are described some procedures and coordination of granting <b>state</b> <b>aid,</b> then how <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> control fits into the framework of European competition policy before we comment extensively on the more economic approach to <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> control, as implemented by the European Commission, and the <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> action plan. Control of <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> is of increasing importance {{in the context of}} European competition policy in order to maintain a fair level of activity of all enterprises participating in the European markets, regardless of the Member State in which they reside. The theoretical fundamentals of <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> are important to be studied and applied. Were distinguished and described the main approaches in the evolution of economic theories in the field of <b>State</b> <b>aid.</b> Criteria were established to determine the government's actions as <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> and intervention methods analyzed. It is important to think about the implications of <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> at an early stage. Doing so allows assistance to be designed and given more quickly and effectively and avoids potential problems later. A program of assistance that does not follow the rules could be forced to close. Giving <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> illegally could result in the money having to be clawed back with possibly very serious consequences for the recipient. The European Commission monitors and controls <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> in the EU by requiring member states to notify the Commission in advance of proposed <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> in order to ensure compliance. If a European company believes that a competitor is receiving illegal aid then they should complain directly to the Commission on the complaints form. The Commission is obliged under the Procedural Regulation to act on any evidence of potential illegal aid and will therefore take complaints seriously, but all these aspects are described in the present research...|$|R

40|$|Taxation as <b>State</b> <b>Aid</b> The {{purpose of}} my thesis is to analyse {{taxation}} {{in connection with}} <b>state</b> <b>aid.</b> The reason for my research {{is to find out}} how Member States of European Union can use taxation without interfering with <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> provisions. The thesis is composed of three chapters. Chapter One is an introduction to the topic. There is a description of basic <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> provisions, taxation within European Union and the tax competition between Member States. Chapter Two examines article 107 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in respect of taxation. The chapter consists of nine parts. Five ones further discuss constituent elements of <b>state</b> <b>aid,</b> where the main attention is given to selectivity as the main problem in <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> cases. Another four parts focus on procedure, judicial review, recovery of <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> and de minimis regulation. This chapter is the key part of the thesis because it pursues better understanding of <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> definition with respect to taxation. Chapter Three concentrates on problems resulting from the intersection of <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> and taxation such as the influence on double taxation treaties, discretionary powers of Member State's authorities, different taxation of autonomous regions, and so on. Conclusions summarize the importance of <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> in internal market [...] ...|$|R

50|$|<b>State</b> <b>aid</b> for {{libraries}} (also {{known as}} <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> for public libraries, <b>state</b> <b>aid,</b> direct <b>aid</b> or <b>state</b> funding) is funding provided to public libraries by state {{governments in the}} United <b>States.</b> <b>State</b> <b>aid</b> is typically divided among all libraries in a state {{in the form of}} block grants. Each eligible library receives a percentage of <b>state</b> <b>aid</b> based on the library's budget, income and population served. <b>State</b> <b>aid</b> supplements local library budgets, and is particularly important for rural libraries and libraries supported by a small tax base. Other reasons <b>states</b> offer <b>aid</b> to libraries are to promote resource sharing among libraries; to encourage cities to establish and support libraries; and to establish minimum standards for libraries. <b>State</b> <b>aid</b> is combined with other forms of library funding—including federal aid, funding by local governments and private philanthropy—to provide money for library books, staff and information technology.
