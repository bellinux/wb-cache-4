This mode scatters signals mostly forwards and backwards when using horizontal polarization and side-scattering with vertical polarization. Forward-scattering typically yields propagation ranges of 800km. Scattering from snowflakes and ice pellets also occurs, but scattering from ice without watery surface is less effective. The most common application for this phenomenon is microwave rain radar, but rain <b>scatter</b> <b>propagation</b> can be a nuisance causing unwanted signals to intermittently propagate where they are not anticipated or desired. Similar reflections may also occur from insects though at lower altitudes and shorter range. Rain also causes attenuation of point-to-point and satellite microwave links.

40|$|International audienceThe {{paradigm}} of Compressive Sensing (CS) {{has emerged in}} the last few years as a flexible and powerful methodological strategy to address synthesis and analysis problems arising in wave <b>scattering</b> and <b>propagation</b> engineering. The success of CS techniques is motivated by several factors, including (i) their capability to address sampling/recovery problems overcoming the classical Nyquist/Shannon limits, (ii) their flexibility and ease of adaptation to several different scenarios, including array design, direction-of-arrival estimation, microwave and radar imaging, (iii) the availability of powerful, effective, and numerically efficient implementations of CS sampling and retrieval algorithms. Accordingly, and despite their relatively recent introduction, the research on the development, application, generalization, and customization of CS techniques has already become one of the most active areas within wave <b>scattering</b> and <b>propagation</b> engineering. Within this framework, this invited paper is aimed at illustrating the fundamental features of Compressive Sensing as well as at discussing its potential applicability in wave <b>scattering</b> and <b>propagation</b> problems also through a review of the recent advances in the state-of-the-art concerning CS. Some current research trends and open challenges will be also discussed...|$|R

The effect of complex weather, stumbling block and the transmitter and the receiver in different height are discussed.

30|$|In this work, we have {{proposed}} an empirical method {{to detect and}} measure phase offsets in HF interferometry data. The proposed method allows for reliable post-calibration of the historic data, i.e. when the conventional calibration using signal generators is frequently too challenging or nearly impossible, e.g. owing {{to changes in the}} hardware. The method is based on analysing the progression of elevation angle with range for ground scatter echoes and uses a gradual adjustment of the phase shift until the observed dependence agrees with that expected from a reflecting ionospheric layer. The theoretical basis for this technique was laid through the simulation of ground <b>scatter</b> <b>propagation</b> characteristics using numerical ray tracing and an analysis of the effects of phase fluctuations on elevation. The method was successfully applied to Hokkaido East SuperDARN radar data producing a reliable estimate of the virtual reflection height. The method also provides the basis to extend diagnostic capabilities of the network to a measure of the background electron density (Ponomarenko et al. 2011 b). The use of the proposed technique is not limited to SuperDARN and can be applied to any kind of HF interferometry data.|$|E
40|$|The {{bi-directional}} {{use of frequencies}} {{allocated for}} space communications {{has the potential to}} double the orbit/spectrum capacity available. The technical feasibility of reverse band use (RBU) at C-band (4 GHz uplinks and 6 GHz downlinks) is studied. The analysis identifies the constraints under which both forward and reverse band use satellite systems can share the same frequencies with terrestrial, line of sight transmission systems. The results of the analysis show that RBU satellite systems can be similarly sized to forward band use (FBU) satellite systems. In addition, the orbital separation requirements between RBU and FBU satellite systems are examined. The analysis shows that a carrier to interference ratio of 45 dB can be maintained between RBU and FBU satellites separated by less than 0. 5 deg, and that A carrier to interference ratio of 42 dB can be maintained in the antipodal case. Rain <b>scatter</b> <b>propagation</b> analysis shows that RBU and FBU earth stations require separation distances of less than 10 km at a rain rate of 13. 5 mm/hr escalating to less than 100 km at a rain rate of 178 mm/hr for earth station antennas in the 3 to 10 m range...|$|E
40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the synthesis and evaluation of inte-grated communication systems constructed specifically to perform in the presence of channel disturbances of the form encountered in multipathpropagation. In the communication system considered, information is conveyed from source to user by encoding it into electrical symbols at the transmitter and decoding it at the re-ceiver. Statistical theory, including information theory, is used throughout the paper. Gross aspects of multiple-mode propagation and ionospheric scattering are discussed, and previous efforts to improve systems affected by these disturbances are reviewed. System capacities are computed for the transmission of band-limited white Gaussian signals through fixed multiple-mode dis-turbances, and the optimum spectral distribution of transmitter power is found. In general, presence of additional paths does not upset the message-handling capabilities of the channel if suitable wide-band signals are used. Quasi-stationary path fluctuations are considered, and a technique for measurement of the multipath characteristic by the receiver is suggested. Capacities arefound for slow path delay fluctuations. Single-mode <b>scatter</b> <b>propagation</b> is considered as a complex multiplicative Gaussian process. The probability computing receiver is found analytically, and a physical realization is developed for small signal-to-noise ratios. Lower bounds to system capacity are found for a binary transmission through scatter. Incidental results are system capacities for a related multiplicative channel, and the capacity for a binary trans-mission through white Gaussian noise...|$|E

Moreover, we evaluate a hybrid beamforming technique using our proposed single-carrier beamforming methods at the RF along with a multicarrier technique using zero-forcing (ZF) at the baseband. Furthermore, we examine the performance of this method for a subconnected architecture, and with the use of digital phase shifters. Our simulation results and analysis indicate that single-carrier RF beamforming with multicarrier baseband techniques is indeed a promising solution for frequency-selective, rich scattering massive MIMO scenarios.
