500|$|In December 2016, Dota 2 was updated to {{gameplay}} version 7.00, {{known as}} [...] "The New Journey" [...] update. Prior to the update, the Dota series {{had been in}} version 6.xx for over a decade, marking the first major revision since IceFrog originally took over development of the original mod in the mid 2000s. The New Journey update added and changed numerous features and mechanics of the game, including adding the first original hero not ported over from Defense of the Ancients, a reworked map, a redesigned HUD, a pre-game phase that allows for players to discuss their team strategy, and a [...] "Talent Tree" [...] hero augmentation system. In April 2017, Valve announced changes to the game's ranked matchmaking system, with the main one requiring the registration of a unique phone number to a player's account in order to play them, an anti-griefing and <b>smurfing</b> practice they had previously implemented in their first-person shooter game, [...] Further changes to the game's matchmaking were brought in an update in November 2017, where the old numerical MMR system {{was replaced by a}} seasonal tiered one based on [...] "medals" [...] that are recalibrated every six months, a move that brought the game's ranked system closer to ones used in other competitive games such as Global Offensive and League of Legends.|$|E

The following day, Handy <b>Smurf</b> asks the <b>Smurf</b> for a remedy, so the <b>Smurf</b> gives him a recipe.

2500|$|In 2004 it was {{discovered}} that Portas's CDS-PP party had deposited 1,065,250 euros through 105 low-denomination deposits into the party's accounts in an attempt to circumvent monitoring regulations on political party funding and possibly on money-laundering (see <b>smurfing).</b> It was factually established that CDS-PP fabricated the donor receipts (including some using comical names such as [...] "Jacinto Leite Capelo Rego," [...] which in Portuguese is an erotic pun on words) but the real source of the money was never identified. In investigating, the police suspected the Espírito Santo Group (on whose bank the money was deposited) to have donated that money in connection with a tourism development named 'Portucale' in Benavente that entailed the cutting down of thousands of protected cork trees, which Paulo Portas, through his (until then) best friend and party colleague Luís Nobre Guedes, allegedly facilitated {{in the final days of}} the government to which they belonged. Paulo Portas denied any illegality and was not directly implicated in the case, while Nobre Guedes took the blame (and stopped talking to Paulo Portas). However, in investigating this case, the police intercepted phone calls that motivated another investigation into the costly purchase of two submarines by the Portuguese State (see below). It turned out that in addition to the Espírito Santo Group's real estate subsidiary in charge of the Portucale project (ESAF) there was another trading subsidiary (ESCOM) that was also an intermediary in a major submarines deal, for which it had received 30 million euros in advance and which was judicially suspected to have been the source of the CDS-PP deposits as a kickback pay-off for the submarines intermediation.|$|E
5000|$|Humans {{have found}} that {{replacing}} ordinary words with the term [...] "smurf" [...] at random is not enough: in one adventure, Peewit explains to some other humans that the statement [...] "I'm <b>smurfing</b> to the smurf" [...] means [...] "I'm going to the wood", but a Smurf corrects him {{by saying that the}} proper statement would be [...] "I'm <b>smurfing</b> to the smurf"; whereas what Peewit said was [...] "I'm warbling to the dawn". So [...] "I'm <b>smurfing</b> to the smurf" [...] {{is not the same as}} [...] "I'm <b>smurfing</b> to the smurf".|$|E

50|$|Dupuis, {{editor of}} the <b>Smurf</b> comics, first {{produced}} <b>smurf</b> figurines in 1959. The first one {{was a series of}} three figurines, 5 centimetres tall (Papa, Normal and Angry), followed in the next decade by some larger figurines. Those were only for sale in French- and Dutch-speaking countries. In 1965, Schleich, a German company, made the first truly mass-produced PVC <b>Smurf</b> collectible figurines (the first three being Normal <b>Smurf,</b> Gold <b>Smurf</b> and Convict <b>Smurf</b> (complete with black-and-white striped prisoner's outfit). In 1966, Spy <b>Smurf,</b> Angry <b>Smurf,</b> and Drummer <b>Smurf</b> appeared. In 1969, five more <b>smurfs</b> followed: Moon <b>Smurf,</b> Winter <b>Smurf,</b> Brainy <b>Smurf,</b> Guitar <b>Smurf,</b> and Papa <b>Smurf.</b> In the 1970s, <b>smurfs</b> were also produced by rival German company Bully.

The IMPCPA administers methamphetamine precursor control strategies that assist law enforcement in {{reducing the number of}} methamphetamine manufacturing labs in Southern Illinois. This strategy employs an automated pseudoephedrine purchase tracking system that identifies purchase patterns associated with <b>smurfing.</b> <b>Smurfing</b> is a tactic used by small batch labs to obtain significant amounts of pseudoephedrine. Individuals, known as smurfs, make small pseudoephedrine purchases at numerous pharmacies. These legal purchases are then combined to manufacture meth.|$|E

5000|$|A {{characteristic}} of the Smurf language is the frequent use of the undefinable word [...] "smurf" [...] and its derivatives {{in a variety of}} meanings.
