2500|$|A {{classic example}} of a <b>single-blind</b> <b>test</b> is the Pepsi Challenge. A tester, often a {{marketing}} person, prepares two sets of cups of cola labeled [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B". One set of cups is filled with Pepsi, while the other is filled with Coca-Cola. The tester knows which soda is in which cup but {{is not supposed to}} reveal that information to the subjects. Volunteer subjects are encouraged to try the two cups of soda and polled for which ones they prefer. One of the problems with a <b>single-blind</b> <b>test</b> like this is that the tester can unintentionally give subconscious cues which influence the subjects. In addition, it is possible the tester could intentionally introduce bias by preparing the separate sodas differently (e.g., by putting more ice in one cup or by pushing one cup closer to the subject). If the tester is a marketing person employed by the company which is producing the challenge, there's always the possibility of a conflict of interest where the marketing person is aware that future income will be {{based on the results of}} the test.|$|E

IOP by Goldmann applanation tonometer, systemic blood pressure and pulse rate in the supine position were recorded hourly before and after administration. In both groups a decrease in mean IOP was noted after one hour and this reduction reached its maximum three hours after the administration of propranolol. The absolute reduction was greater in the group with the highest initial IOP and in both groups the fall in mean IOP showed a clear dose-dependent correlation. The simultaneous mean decrease in pulse rate was also dose-correlated, but reached its maximum two hours after administration.

The design was a <b>single-blind</b> <b>test</b> of a neuropsychological intervention, with pre- and post-treatment assessments of personality and social behavior. MS patients underwent neurological examination and neuropsychological testing at baseline. The patients were then randomly assigned to neuropsychological counseling or standard, non-specific supportive psychotherapy. The active 12 -week treatment emphasized enhancement of insight through education, social skills training, and behavior modification. All patients were re-examined within 2 weeks of the termination of treatment. Neuropsychological technicians were blind to treatment condition. Both groups showed evidence of cognitive impairment and personality/ behavior disorder prior to treatment and were well matched on demographic, disability, and cognitive measures. Patients who underwent neuropsychological counseling showed significant positive response on measures of social behavior (e. g. excessive ego-centric speech) compared to those who underwent standard counseling. We conclude that these data support the use of non-pharmacological, neuropsychological counseling in patients with acquired, MS-associated behavior disorder.

40|$|To {{disclose}} a quackery called “revitalisation of tired {{water by}} hydronic technology”, scientific experiments {{have been conducted}} with drinking water kept in “ordinary, everyday-use” drinking glasses and so-called ‘informed’ glasses, a patent-protected product supposed {{to have an effect}} on the “structure, vitality and memory of water”. Drinking “informed” water is claimed to have a wide range of positive revitalising health effects (blue informed glass), to facilitate weight loss (red informed glass) and to have a stress-relieving action (green informed glass). Allegedly, by the use of the “orgon methodology”, information is coded into the glass, which action is additionally enforced by the addition of the “magic life” symbol - a specially designed energy condenser which, together with the selected information, is permanently introduced into the liquid contained in the glass. Since the manufacturer claimed the products to have a broad bactericidal action, regardless of the external conditions and completely independent from additional factor that would lead to the activation of the system, the efficacy of the informed drinking glass was tested using standardised, microbiological tests. Respecting the principle of a <b>single-blind</b> <b>test</b> for each of 5 samples of each type of the informed glass, growth reduction factor (RF) (difference log cfu/ml - colony per unit/ml of control glass and log cfu/ml of each informed glass) was determined after 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h in spring water experimentally contaminated with standardised ATCC strains of two types of bacteria and one yeast. The results showed a statistically significant bactericidal action of the blue informed glass with all strains-Enterococcus faecalis (RF 0. 62 / 0. 76), Salmonella enteritidis (RF 0. 87 / 0. 97), and Candida albicans (RF 0. 5 / 0. 60) - as opposed to the red and green glasses where this effect was negligible (RF < 0. 1). However, when the tests were repeated in complete darkness, none of the three informed glasses showed any bactericidal action. The obtained results indicate a fraud: bactericidal effect is rather a result of photocatalytic action of a hidden component used on purpose in the production of glass or subsequently applied by the use of nanotechnology (possibly antimony trioxide or titanium oxide) than of the so-called “orgon and hydronic technology”...|$|E

40|$|Background The {{transit time}} of the small intestine, in {{addition}} to lactase activity, may influence lactose digestion and thus {{play a role in}} the occurrence of lactose intolerance. The objectives of this study were to investigate the effect of lactose on the oro-cecal transit time (OCTT) in lactose digesters and maldigesters as well as the possible mechanisms underlying these effects. Materials and Methods Twenty-eight Chinese subjects and 16 Dutch subjects underwent one glucose and one lactose challenge in two <b>single-blinded</b> <b>tests.</b> Twenty of the Chinese subjects without complaints after the challenge then underwent another lactose challenge. A 6 -h symptom score (SSC) was recorded, breath-hydrogen concentration was measured and OCTT after consumption of glucose and lactose was determined with the lactose-[C- 13] ureide breath test. The lactose digestion index (LDI) was determined in both the Dutch and 20 Chinese subjects with the C- 13 /H- 2 -glucose test. Results Lactose digesters (n = 13) and maldigesters (n = 20) were classified based on the results of the LDI and the breath-hydrogen test. The OCTT after the lactose and glucose challenges did not differ in the digesters, whereas in the maldigesters the OCTT, after the lactose challenge, was shorter than that after glucose. There was no difference in OCTT after the glucose challenge between the maldigesters and the digesters. However, the OCTT after the lactose challenge in the maldigesters was shorter than that in the digesters. The LDI of the digesters was significantly higher than that of the maldigesters. The OCTT after the lactose challenge was not correlated to the LDI in the maldigesters nor in the digesters. Based on the SSC after the one glucose and two lactose challenges, a tolerant (n = 7) and an intolerant (n = 5) group were classified in the Chinese subjects. The two groups did not differ in their LDI or OCTT after the lactose challenge. The OCTT after the lactose challenge was not correlated to the SSC or the LDI. Conclusions Lactose triggers a faster oro-cecal transit in lactose maldigesters, but not in digesters. However, this could not be explained by intestinal distension resulting from the osmotic load posed by maldigested lactose, and thus suggests a direct effect of lactose on intrinsic factors regulating intestinal motility...|$|R

40|$|Background: Secondary {{thrombocytosis}} is {{a common}} clinical feature. In patients with cancer, it is {{a risk factor for}} venous thromboembolic events. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), thrombocytosis is so far considered a marker of active disease and may contribute to the increased thromboembolic risk in this population. Observed effects of iron therapy on normalization of platelet counts led us to hypothesize that iron itself may regulate megakaryopoiesis. Here, we want to test the effect of iron replacement on platelet count and activity in IBD-associated thrombocytosis. Methods: We performed a randomized, <b>single-blinded</b> placebo-controlled trial <b>testing</b> the effect of ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) in patients with IBD with secondary thrombocytosis (platelets. 450 G/L).

40|$|It has {{recently}} been demonstrated how perceptual learning, that is an improvement in a sensory/perceptual task upon practice, can be boosted by concurrent high-frequency transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS). It {{has also been shown}} that perceptual learning can generalize and produce an improvement of visual functions in participants with mild refractive defects. By using three different groups of participants (<b>single-blind</b> study), we <b>tested</b> the efficacy of a short training (8 sessions) using a single Gabor contrast-detection task with concurrent hf-tRNS in comparison with the same training with sham stimulation or hf-tRNS with no concurrent training, in improving visual acuity (VA) and contrast sensitivity (CS) of individuals with uncorrected mild myopia. A short training with a contrast detection task is able to improve VA and CS only if coupled with hf-tRNS, whereas no effect on VA and marginal effects on CS are seen with the sole administration of hf-tRNS. Our results support the idea that, by boosting the rate of perceptual learning via the modulation of neuronal plasticity, hf-tRNS can be successfully used to reduce the duration of the perceptual training and/or to increase its efficacy in producing perceptual learning and generalization to improved VA and CS in individuals with uncorrected mild myopia.

40|$|Abstract. Background: Patients with aspirin-sensitive {{respiratory}} {{and skin}} diseases experience cross reactions to all nonsteroidal anti-infl ammatory drugs (NSAIDs) which inhibit cyclooxigenase (COX) enzymes. The {{need to identify}} an alternative drug that is safe and reliable is a common problem in clinical practice. Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to test the tolerability of meloxicam in NSAID-sensitive patients. Methods: Between January 2005 and February 2006 we performed <b>single-blind</b> oral challenge <b>tests</b> with meloxicam in NSAID-intolerant patients, exposing them fi rst to placebo and then, after 30 minutes, to the fi rst dose of meloxicam (7. 5 mg). After 30 minutes, if no response appeared, the last dose of meloxicam (15 mg) was given, for a total accumulated dose of 22. 5 mg. The test was considered positive if urticaria, erythema, and/or angioedema appeared. Results: We tested 114 patients: 36 % men and 64 % women whose mean age was 45. 81 years. Meloxicam was well tolerated in 109 of the 114 patients (95. 62 %) and only 5 (4. 38 %) developed an adverse reaction (urticaria in all cases). Conclusion: This study shows that meloxicam can be a good option for NSAID-intolerant patients: it was safe for over 95 % of the patients and is easier to obtain than celecoxib or etoricoxib.

40|$|The {{responsiveness}} to non-invasive neuromodulation protocols shows high inter-individual variability, the reasons of which remain poorly understood. We here tested whether {{the response to}} intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) – an effective repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) protocol for increasing cortical excitability – depends on network properties of the cortical motor system. We furthermore investigated whether the {{responsiveness to}} iTBS is dose-dependent. To this end, we used a sham-stimulation controlled, <b>single-blinded</b> within-subject design <b>testing</b> {{for the relationship between}} iTBS aftereffects and (i) motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) as well as (ii) resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) in 16 healthy subjects. In each session, three blocks of iTBS were applied, separated by 15 min. We found that non-responders (subjects not showing an MEP increase of ≥ 10 % after one iTBS block) featured stronger rsFC between the stimulated primary motor cortex (M 1) and premotor areas before stimulation compared to responders. However, only the group of responders showed increases in rsFC and MEPs, while most non-responders remained close to baseline levels after all three blocks of iTBS. Importantly, there was still a large amount of variability in both groups. Our data suggest that responsiveness to iTBS at the local level (i. e., M 1 excitability) depends upon the pre-interventional network connectivity of the stimulated region. Of note, increasing iTBS dose did not turn non-responders into responders. The finding that higher levels of pre-interventional connectivity precluded a response to iTBS could reflect a ceiling effect underlying non-responsiveness to iTBS at the systems lev...|$|R

Following 2 weeks of wash-out of the current therapy and 1 week of placebo, 26 patients underwent two cycloergometer tests, before and 2 hours after placebo administration. Subsequently, 10 mg of nisoldipine twice daily or 40 mg of propranolol three times daily were administered over a 4 week period, in a randomized <b>single-blind</b> fashion. Cycloergometer <b>tests</b> were performed after 2 and 4 weeks, before and two hours after drug administration. Two patients, {{one out of the}} nisoldipine group and one out of the propranolol, were considered drop outs. Statistical analysis of the results was performed using two-way variance analysis. With both drugs, time to 1 mm exercise induced ST-segment depression (p less than 0. 01), time to angina (p less than 0. 01), and exercise tolerance (p less than 0. 01) improved furthermore, ST-segment and heart rate recovery time decreased (p less than 0. 01). Rate-pressure product values at ischemic threshold and at peak exercise remained unchanged with nisoldipine, while significant reductions were observed with propranolol (p less than 0. 01).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Skin testing {{with major}} and minor {{determinants}} of benzylpenicillin is recommended standard practice {{for the evaluation of}} patients with immediate hypersensitivity reactions to beta-lactams. However, commercial reagents for this purpose were recently dropped from the European market. OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we assessed a new brand of reagents for use in skin testing in patients with suspected penicillin allergy. METHODS: Prick tests and intradermal tests were performed with benzylpenicilloyl polylysine (PPL) and minor determinant mixture (MDM). Penicillin G, amoxicillin, and the culprit beta-lactam were also tested. If skin tests were negative, a <b>single-blind</b> oral challenge <b>test</b> was performed with the culprit active principle or penicillin. If both skin tests and challenge tests were negative, the same procedure was repeated between 2 and 4 weeks later. RESULTS: A total of 636 patients were assessed. The allergy study was positive in 69 patients. Skin tests with PPL were positive in 30 patients (46. 8 %) and with MDM in 28 (43. 7 %). Sixteen patients displayed a positive reaction to both PPL and MDM (25 %), while 42 patients (65. 6 %) had a positive reaction to either PPL or MDM alone. Thirty-two patients had positive skin test reactions to penicillin G or another p-lactam antibiotic. Five patients in whom a negative result was obtained in skin tests had a positive reaction to oral challenge. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that a new brand of determinants that is commercially available in Europe is a reliable and useful tool for the diagnosis of beta-lactam allergy.

Pureed &V products retain many beneficial components, including flavonoids, carotenoids, vitamin C and dietary fibres. This study aimed to establish the physiological effects of acute ingestion of F&V puree-based drink (FVPD) on vasodilation, antioxidant status, phytochemical bioavailability and other CVD risk factors. 24 Subjects, aged 30 - 70 years, completed the randomised, <b>single-blind,</b> controlled, crossover <b>test</b> meal study. Subjects consumed 400 ml FVPD, or fruit-flavoured sugar-matched control, after following a low-flavonoid diet for 5 days. Blood and urine samples were collected throughout the study day and vascular reactivity was assessed at 90 -minute intervals using laser Doppler iontophoresis (LDI). FVPD significantly increased plasma vitamin C (P= 0. 002) and total nitrate/nitrite (P= 0. 001) concentrations. There was a near significant time by treatment effect on ex vivo LDL oxidation (P= 0. 068), with a longer lag phase after consuming FVPD. During the 6 hours after juice consumption the antioxidant capacity of plasma increased significantly (P= 0. 003) {{and there was a}} simultaneous increase in plasma and urinary phenolic metabolites (P= 0. 05). There were significantly lower glucose and insulin peaks after ingestion of FVPD compared with control (P= 0. 019 and P= 0. 003) and a trend towards increased endothelium-dependent vasodilation following FVPD consumption (P= 0. 061). Overall, FVPD consumption significantly increased plasma vitamin C and total nitrate/nitrite concentrations, with a trend towards increased endothelium-dependent vasodilation. Pureed F&V products are useful vehicles for increasing micronutrient status, plasma antioxidant capacity and in vivo NO generation, which may contribute to CVD risk reduction...|$|R
40|$|Acute {{whiplash}} is {{a heterogeneous}} disorder that becomes persistent in 40 % to 60 % of cases. Estimates of recovery {{have not changed}} in recent decades. This randomized, <b>single-blind,</b> controlled trial <b>tested</b> whether multidisciplinary individualized treatments for patients with acute whiplash (< 4 weeks postinjury) could {{reduce the incidence of}} chronicity at 6 mo by 50 % compared to usual care. Participants (n = 101) were recruited from accident and emergency centres and the community. It was hypothesized that better recovery rates were achievable if the heterogeneity was recognised and patients received individualised interventions. Patients randomized to pragmatic intervention (n = 49) could receive pharmaceutical management (ranging from simple medications to opioid analgesia), multimodal physiotherapy and psychology for post-traumatic stress according to their presentations. The treatment period was 10 wks with follow-up at 11 weeks and 6 and 12 -months. The primary outcome was neck pain and disability (Neck Disability Index (NDI)). Analysis revealed no significant differences in frequency of recovery (NDI ? 8 %) between pragmatic and usual care groups at 6 months (OR 95 %, CI = 0. 55, 0. 23 - 1. 29), P = 0. 163) or 12 mo (OR 95 %, CI = 0. 65, 0. 28 - 1. 47, P = 0. 297). There was no improvement in current nonrecovery rates at 6 mo (63. 6 %, pragmatic care; 48. 8 %, usual care), indicating no advantage of the early multiprofessional intervention. Baseline levels of pain and disability had a significant bearing on recovery both at 6 and 12 mo in both groups, suggesting that future research focus on finding early effective pain management, particularly for the subgroup of patients with initial high levels of pain and disability, towards improving recovery rates.

40|$|Image {{segmentation}} {{has become}} a vital and often rate-limiting step in modern radiotherapy treatment planning. In recent years, the pace and scope of algorithm development, and even introduction into the clinic, have far exceeded evaluative studies. In this work we build upon our previous evaluation of a registration driven segmentation algorithm {{in the context of}} 8 expert raters and 20 patients who underwent radiotherapy for large space-occupying tumours in the brain. In this work we tested four hypotheses concerning the impact of manual segmentation editing in a randomized <b>single-blinded</b> study. We <b>tested</b> these hypotheses on the normal structures of the brainstem, optic chiasm, eyes and optic nerves using the Dice similarity coefficient, volume, and signed Euclidean distance error to evaluate the impact of editing on inter-rater variance and accuracy. Accuracy analyses relied on two simulated ground truth estimation methods: simultaneous truth and performance level estimation and a novel implementation of probability maps. The experts were presented with automatic, their own, and their peers' segmentations from our previous study to edit. We found, independent of source, editing reduced inter-rater variance while maintaining or improving accuracy and improving efficiency with at least 60 % reduction in contouring time. In areas where raters performed poorly contouring from scratch, editing of the automatic segmentations reduced the prevalence of total anatomical miss from approximately 16 % to 8 % of the total slices contained within the ground truth estimations. These findings suggest that contour editing could be useful for consensus building such as in developing delineation standards, and that both automated methods and even perhaps less sophisticated atlases could improve efficiency, inter-rater variance, and accuracy. © 2013 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.

40|$|ObjectiveDried {{blood spot}} (DBS) {{methodology}} offers significant advantages over venipuncture in vulnerable populations or large-scale studies, including reduced participant burden and higher response rates. Uncertainty about validity of cardiovascular risk biomarkers remains {{a barrier to}} wide-scale use. We determined the validity of DBS-derived biomarkers of CVD risk versus gold-standard assessments, and study-specific, serum-equivalency values for clinical relevance of DBS-derived values. MethodsConcurrent venipuncture serum and DBS samples (n= 150 adults) were assayed in CLIA-certified and DBS laboratories, respectively. Time controls of DBS standard samples were assayed <b>single-blind</b> along with <b>test</b> samples. Linear regression analyses evaluated DBS-to-serum equivalency values; agreement and bias were assessed via Bland-Altman plots. ResultsLinear regressions of venipuncture values on DBS-to-serum equivalencies provided R 2 values for TC, HDL-C, CRP of 0. 484, 0. 118, 0. 666, respectively. Bland-Altman plots revealed minimal systematic bias between DBS-to-serum and venipuncture values; precision worsened at higher mean values of CRP. Time controls reveal little degradation or change in analyte values for HDL-C and CRP over 30 weeks. ConclusionsDBS-assessed biomarkers represent a valid alternative to venipuncture assessments. Large studies using DBS should include study-specific serum-equivalency determinations to optimize individual-level sensitivity, viability of detecting intervention effects, and generalizability in community-level, primary prevention interventions.

FeAST, a prospective, randomized, <b>single-blind</b> clinical trial, <b>tested</b> the hypothesis that reduction of iron stores using phlebotomy would influence clinical outcomes in 1227 PAD patients randomized to iron reduction or control groups. The effects of statin administration were also examined in the Sierra Nevada Health Care (SNHC) cohort by measuring serum ferritin levels at entry and during the 6 -year study period. No difference was documented between treatment groups in all-cause mortality and secondary outcomes of death plus nonfatal myocardial infarction and stroke. Iron reduction in the main study caused a significant age-related improvement in cardiovascular disease outcomes, new cancer diagnoses, and cancer-specific death. MethodsTumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α, TNF-α receptors 1 and 2, interleukin (IL) - 2, IL- 6, IL- 10, and high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP) were measured at entry and at 6 -month intervals for 6 years. Average levels of ferritin and lipids at entry {{and at the end}} of the study were compared. The clinical course and ferritin levels of 23 participants who died during the study were reviewed. ResultsAt entry, mean age of entry was 67 ± 9 years for the SNHCS cohort, comparable to FeAST and clinical and laboratory parameters were equivalent in substudy participants randomized to iron reduction (n = 51) or control (n = 49). At baseline, 53 participants on statins had slightly lower mean entry-level ferritin values (114. 06 ng/mL; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 93. 43 - 134. 69) vs the 47 off statins (127. 62 ng/mL; 95 % CI, 103. 21 - 152. 02). Longitudinal analysis of follow-up data, after adjusting for the phlebotomy treatment effect, showed that statin use was associated with significantly lower ferritin levels (− 29. 78 ng/mL; Cohen effect size, − 0. 47 [tdf, 134 = 2. 33, P =. 02]). Mean follow-up average ferritin levels were higher in 23 participants who died (132. 5 ng/mL; 95 % CI, 79. 36 - 185. 66) vs 77 survivors (83. 6 ng/mL; 95 % CI, 70. 34 - 96. 90; Wilcoxon P =. 05). Mean follow-up IL- 6 levels were higher in dead participants (21. 68 ng/mL; 95 % CI, 13. 71 - 29. 66) vs survivors (12. 61 ng/mL; 95 % CI, 10. 72 - 14. 50; Wilcoxon P =. 018). Ferritin levels correlated (Pearson) with average IL- 6 levels (r = 0. 1845; P =. 002) and hsCRP levels (r =. 1175; P =. 04) during the study. ConclusionThese data demonstrate statistical correlations between levels of ferritin, inflammatory biomarkers, and mortality in this subset of patients with PAD. Clinical RelevanceThis research examined relationships between iron storage and inflammatory biomarkers in a cohort of 100 cancer-free PAD patients with peripheral arterial disease from the Veterans Affairs (VA) Sierra Nevada Health Care System (SNHCS) cohort participating in a prospective, randomized, single-blind, clinical trial to test the hypothesis that iron in excess of physiologic requirements promotes atherosclerosis. Calibrated phlebotomy was used to reduce iron storage in risk factor-matched participants. The main study, VA Cooperative Study (CSP) 410, demonstrated clinical benefits in reduction of death from primary and secondary end points for participants aged between 43 and 61 years. This SNHCS substudy demonstrated significant relationships between total body iron stores as determined by ferritin, inflammatory cytokines, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). Ferritin levels positively correlated with interleukin- 6 levels and hsCRP levels, whereas ferritin and interleukin- 6 levels were significantly higher in participants who died vs survivors. Statin administration reduced ferritin levels independently of phlebotomy, indicating an effect of these agents on iron metabolism. Our findings support a biologic rationale for measurement of serial ferritin levels in patients with atherosclerosis. Because iron-induced oxidative stress contributes to inflammatory responses, determination of optimal iron marker levels to be maintained by calibrated phlebotomy is a clinically relevant concept for future outcome studies...|$|R
