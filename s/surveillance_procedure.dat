40|$|The {{surveillance}} of multivariate processes has received growing attention {{during the last}} decade. Several generalizations of well-known methods such as Shew hart, CUSUM and EWMA charts have been proposed. Many of these multivariate procedures {{are based on a}} univariate summarized statistic of the multivariate observations, usually the likelihood ratio statistic. In this paper we consider the {{surveillance of}} multivariate observation processes for a shift between two fully specified alternatives. The effect of the dimension reduction using likelihood ratio statistics are discussed in the context of sufficiency properties. Also, an example of the loss of efficiency when not using the univariate sufficient statistic is given. Furthermore, a likelihood ratio method, the LR method, for constructing <b>surveillance</b> <b>procedures</b> is suggested for multivariate surveillance situations. It is shown to produce univariate <b>surveillance</b> <b>procedures</b> based on the sufficient likelihood ratios. As the LR procedure has several optimality properties in the univariate, it is also used here as a benchmark for comparisons between multivariate <b>surveillance</b> <b>procedures...</b>|$|R

40|$|The continual {{surveillance}} {{to detect}} changes {{has so far}} received large attention {{in the area of}} industrial quality control, where the monitoring of manufacturing processes to detect decreases in quality play an important role. However, also in other areas important examples can be found such as the surveillance of intensity care patients or the monitoring of economic trends. Often more than one measurement is made, resulting in a multivariate observation process. Many <b>surveillance</b> <b>procedures</b> for multivariate observation processes are based on summarizing statistics that reduces the multivariate process to a univariate process. This thesis studies such <b>surveillance</b> <b>procedures</b> when a change to a specific alternative is of interest. We give special attention to procedures based on likelihood ratio statistics of the observation vectors since these are known to have several optimality properties. Also, many procedures in use today can be formulated in terms of likelihood ratios. In report I we consider the surveillance of a multivariate process with a common change point for all component processes. We show that the univariate reduction using the likelihood ratio statistic for the observation vector from each observation time is sufficient for detecting the change. Furthermore, the use of a likelihood ratio-based method, the LR method, for constructing <b>surveillance</b> <b>procedures</b> is suggested for multivariate surveillance situations. The LR procedure, as several other multivariate <b>surveillance</b> <b>procedures,</b> can be formulated as univariate procedures based on the univariate process of likelihood ratios. Thus, evaluating these multivariate <b>surveillance</b> <b>procedures</b> which are based on this reduction can be done by using results for univariate procedures, for example those given in report II. The effects of not using a sufficient univariate statistic is also illustrated. In the second report a simulation study of some methods based on likelihood ratios of univariate processes is made. The LR method and the Roberts procedure are compared with two methods that today are in common use, the Shewhart and the CUSUM methods. Several different measurements of performance are used, such as the probability of successful detection, the predictive value and the expected delay of an alarm. The evaluation is made for geometrically distributed change points. For this situation the LR procedure meets several optimality criteria and is therefore suitable as a benchmark. The LR procedure is shown to be robust against misspecifications of the intensities. The CUSUM method appears in the simulations to be closer to the Shewhart method than to the Roberts method in several of the properties investigated, for example the run length distribution and the predictive value. Furthermore, the Roberts procedure is shown to have properties close to the LR procedure for moderately large intensities. It has therefore near optimal properties in these cases...|$|R
