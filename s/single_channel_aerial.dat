40|$|Independent {{component}} analysis (ICA) has found many uses in source separation in biomedical signals. We highlight a methodology and put forward an algorithm which allows <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> ICA {{to be performed}} on <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> biomedical signal recordings. The algorithm uses a fast, deflationary approach to efficiently extract independent processes underlying the <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> recordings. We show that for processes which are reasonably spectrally disjoint the algorithm can separate out individual sources. We show examples of this using brain signal recordings and abdominal foetal recordings...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{detecting}} fetal ECG using abdominal {{signal is}} a commonly used method, but fetal ECG signal {{will be affected}} by maternal ECG. Current FECG extraction algorithms are mainly aiming at multiple channels signal. They often assume there is only one fetus and did not consider multiple births. This paper proposed a <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> blind source separation (SCBSS) algorithm based on source number estimation using multi-algorithm fusion to process single abdominal signal. The method decomposed collected <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> signal into multiple intrinsic mode function (IMF) utilizing Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), mapping <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> into multiple channels. Four multiple channel source number estimation (MCSNE) methods (Bootstrap, Hough, AIC and PCA) were weighting fused to estimate accurate source number and the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) was employed to determine weighted coefficient. According to source number and IMF, nonnegative matrix was constructed and nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) was employed to separate mixed signals. Experiments used <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> signal mixed by four man-made signals and <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> ECG mixed by two to verify the proposed algorithm. Results showed that the proposed algorithm could determine number of independent signal in single acquired signal. FECG could be extracted from <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> observed signal and the algorithm can be used to solve separation of MECG and FECG...|$|R

30|$|In plan view, {{two types}} of {{migration}} are found for <b>single</b> <b>channels</b> inside the complex channel—lateral migration and paleocurrent migration. From the profile, there are lateral, indented and swing migrations. Lateral migration is horizontal, with the thickness of sand bodies {{similar to that of}} <b>single</b> <b>channel.</b> While for indented and swing patterns, the thickness of sand bodies is basically larger than that of a <b>single</b> <b>channel.</b> There are weakly restricted and non-restricted channel systems in this area. From the provenance direction and vertical direction, the channel system tends to evolve from weakly restricted to non-restricted.|$|R
40|$|A radio {{direction}} finding (DF) {{system is}} an antenna array and a receiver arranged in a combination to determine the azimuth angle of a distant emitter. Basically, all DF systems derive the emitter location from an initial determination of the angle-of-arrival (AOA). Radio direction finding techniques have classically been based on multiple-antenna systems employing multiple receivers. Classic techniques such as MUSIC [1][2] and ESPRIT use simultaneous phase information from each antenna to estimate the angle-of-arrival of the signal of interest. In many scenarios (e. g., hand-held systems), however, multiple receivers are impractical. Thus, <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> techniques are of interest, particularly in mobile scenarios. Although the amount of existing research for <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> DF is considerably less than for multi-channel direction finding, <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> direction finding techniques have been previously investigated. Since many of the <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> direction finding techniques are older analog techniques and have been analyzed in previous work, we will investigate a new <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> direction finding technique that takes specific advantage of digital capabilities. Specifically, we propose...|$|R

Conventional wisdom says that dual distribution <b>channels</b> outperform one <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> based on the whole supply chain's performance in the capacity and the supplier's profit. However, this paper finds that the channel structure in the distribution {{plays an important role}} in these performances. The results show that at least one of the dual channels should be centralised in order to outperform the <b>single</b> centralised <b>channel</b> and two decentralised channels always do better than one <b>single</b> decentralised <b>channel.</b> <b>single</b> channels; dual channels; capacity; supplier profit; channel structure; distribution channels; centralised channels; decentralised channels; product distribution. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{decrease}} in intracellular pH (pHi) inhibits whole-cell Kir 4. 1 currents. To understand channel biophysical properties underlying this inhibition, <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> Kir 4. 1 currents were studied in inside-out patches using symmetric concentrations of K+ applied {{to each side}} of the plasma membrane. Under such conditions, inward rectifying currents were observed in about 2 of 3 patches. At pH 7. 4, these currents showed a <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> conductance of 22 pS with a channel open-state probability (Popen) of ≈ 0. 9. The effects of intracellular protons on macroscopic Kir 4. 1 currents were examined in giant inside-out patches at various pH levels of internal solutions. Current amplitude increased with a modest acidification (pH 7. 0 and 6. 6), and decreased with further reductions in pHi. The Kir 4. 1 currents were completely suppressed at pH 5. 4. These effects were fast and reversible. Low pHi inhibited Popen and enhanced <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> conductance in a concentration-dependent manner with pK (midpoint pH value for channel inhibition) of 6. 0 and 6. 8, respectively. At pH 5. 8, Popen was inhibited by 70 % and <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> conductance increased by 35 %. Washout brought both Popen and <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> conductance rapidly back to baseline levels. Theoretical currents were calculated using percentage changes in Popen and <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> conductance at each pH level tested. The trajectory of these currents is very close to that of experimental currents recorded from giant patches. Thus, opposite effects of intracellular protons on Popen and <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> conductance are demonstrated, which are likely to result in changes of macroscopic Kir 4. 1 currents with low pH...|$|R
40|$|The {{abilities}} of <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> cystometry and standard multichannel cystometry to diagnose bladder instability were compared in 100 women {{taking part in}} a single blind crossover trial. In 93 of the women both tests yielded the same result. The <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> system detected every case of detrusor instability but in seven women suggested detrusor contractions that were not evident on multichannel cystometry. These were probably due to changes in abdominal pressure. It is concluded that <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> cystometry when used in conjunction with simple urethral tests can provide most of the information that is obtained in specialist centres investigating bladder function...|$|R

Flood (2001) defines a channel-levee system as a <b>single</b> <b>channel</b> with a levee at each side. These levees are formed by the overspilling and flow stripping of turbidity currents. These are most likely to occur during sea level lowstands. A collection of these channels and levees along with overbank sediments form a channel-levee complex.|$|R
