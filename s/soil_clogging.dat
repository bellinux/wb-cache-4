The potential for water quality to be affected is especially high in alluvial aquifers with a shallow depth to water.

Analyses of water from two lysimeters in the unsaturated zone indicate leachate from the feedlot has percolated to a depth of at least 5 feet but not to a depth of 20 feet.

40|$|Particle {{movement}} and deposition {{are known to}} be serious problems for filtration systems. Dramatic reductions in filter permeability are observed in such cases as consequence of deposition of fine particles transported by fluid in the porous media. Accumulation and deposition of suspended solids in porous media can ultimately lead to clogging. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to assess some relations governing filtration behaviour. Packed sand columns were used to investigate <b>soil</b> <b>clogging,</b> focusing on the questions of identification and the description of porosity damage. Some laboratory filtration tests were carried out using various granular sizes of filters and changes in soil water retention, pore size distribution, and saturated hydraulic conductivity due particle deposition were investigated. The results obtained show that filtration and likely clogging depend on particle concentration and flow conditions. The research results clearly show under what conditions <b>soil</b> <b>clogging</b> occurs and how to mitigate this problem. This potential for clogging has been expressed in terms of soil-type parameters used in soil physics, such as a pore damage index, which gives engineers and geo-hydrologists a tool to assess the potential for clogging in a specific soil condition.

The aforementioned trends are expected to lead to an acute water-deficit condition, since potential evapotranspiration shall increase (both for winter and summer crops) with parallel decrease of precipitation share to irrigation, and obviously effective precipitation for natural groundwater replenishment is expected to further decrease or even vanish over specific years and/or periods. Consequently, water demands will need to be catered for by either groundwater abstractions and/or further abstractions from surface water bodies, thus magnifying the water-deficient budget conditions that have already been established in PRB, as described above. Moreover, as deduced from the presented results, during the wet seasons and especially during winter, a high precipitation intensity variability is anticipated along with overall decrease in total precipitation heights that could potentially lead to: (a) increased flash flood events, (b) <b>soil</b> <b>clogging</b> effects, (c) decreased natural recharge of groundwater bodies.

Limited field work has been conducted on quantifying and modeling pipeflow and internal erosion processes in the field with either natural or artificially created soil pipes. This research utilized an innovative constant-head trench system to conduct constant-head soil pipe experiments in two contrasting streambanks: Dry Creek in northern Mississippi and Cow Creek in northern Oklahoma. Experiments included open pipes, in which the soil pipe was directly connected to the constant- head trench and open at the streambank face, and clogged pipes, which involved plugging the outlet of the soil pipe using soil excavated adjacent to the pipe. A tensiometer network {{was used to measure}} soil water pressures surrounding open and clogged pipe outlets on the streambank face. When pipeflow occurred, flow and sediment samples were collected using flow collection pans to quantify sediment concentrations. Flow and sediment data were used with an existing turbulent pipeflow and internal erosion model to estimate erodibility and critical shear stress properties of the soils, which were subsequently compared to similar properties derived from jet erosion tests. <b>Clogged</b> <b>soil</b> pipes resulted in pore water pressure increases in the soil adjacent to the pipe, which generally remained below saturation during these experimental periods, except at locations close to the plug.

Calibrated erodibility coefficients were much smaller than those measured with jet erosion tests. For the more erodible streambank soils of Cow Creek, sediment concentrations approached 40 g L- 1.

The use of graded rocks or gravel was incorporated {{in all of the}} soil series {{with the exception of the}} Wahiawa series. The Wahiawa and Lahaina soil lysimeters employed a top surface application scheme while the Tantalus and Jaucas lysimeters utilized a lateral flow scheme. Two residential cottages served as the domestic waste water source and produced flows ranging from 3. 15 to 5. 04 X 10 ^ 6 m^ 3 /s (72 - 115 gpd). In general, the Tantalus and Jaucas series attained relatively higher removal efficiencies than the Wahiawa and Lahaina series. However, in all of the soil series, only moderate constituent removals were observed particularly for dissolved solids, organics, ammonia nitrogen, and bacteria. The only constituents which showed high removals were suspended solids and phosphorus.

40|$|The {{assumption}} of ideal drain performance is {{taken into consideration}} {{in the design and}} modeling of subsurface drainage system. In reality however, this is generally not so, and the flow encounters additional resistances due to pipe slotting and clogging around the drains. The present study is intended to investigate the effect of different parameters on the characteristics of subsurface drainage of irrigated land utilizing perforated tile drainage pipes. The saturated flow towards perforated drainage pipes is investigated by means of both laboratory experiments and numerical analysis. The effect of the perforation ratio of the pipe on the entrance resistance and exit hydraulic gradient was studied. The study was performed experimentally by using the sand box model technique and numerically by using energy balance method. Three soil types having different permeabilities were used. The perforation ratio of the drainage pipe was changed to take 3. 3 %, 4. 96 % and 6. 62 %. Two cases of water level were chosen. The results indicated that, the perforation ratio affects not only the seepage discharge but also the water table elevation for the flow towards the pipe. Increasing the perforation ratio of drainage pipe causes an increasing of the seepage flow towards the drain. It was found also, that the coefficient of entrance resistance decreases with the increase of both the perforation ratio and the mean diameter of soils. For fine texture soils and for high perforation ratio, the coefficient of entrance resistance is increased. So, it is concluded that the use of envelope from coarse soil around the pipe will decrease the <b>soil</b> <b>clogging</b> and hence the entrance resistance.

Based on its current National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, the WWTP will require additional reduction of temperature and ammonia levels in the summer, especially in the critical month of September. The present research focuses {{on the performance of}} a 0. 15 ha constructed pilot wetland during the summer and early fall of 2009. The wetland was intended to demonstrate the feasibility of using treatment wetlands to lower temperature and ammonia during an annual operational period (approximately June through October). Point sensors and a fiber optic distributed temperature sensor (DTS) were used to assess temperature treatment during the study. Infiltration was monitored to characterize the hydrogeologic behavior of the site. A wetland water budget was used to determine system-wide infiltration, and heat pulses applied to a subsurface fiber optic cable were used to assess infiltrative variability. The results showed that temperature reduction in the pilot wetland was marginal over the study period. In the September critical month, significantly more treatment occurred in the WWTP storage lagoon than in the wetland (about 4 °C cooling compared to 1. 2 °C in the wetland). Decreasing the hydraulic retention time from 2. 5 to 0. 5 days in mid-September did not change the average temperature treatment. DTS data demonstrated that all temperature reduction occurred {{in the first half of}} the wetland. Infiltration was greater than outflow for most of the study, and steadily decreased through time. The highest and lowest infiltration velocities were within a factor of 2, and this range also declined between November 2008 and June 2009. Potential explanations for decreasing infiltration include <b>soil</b> <b>clogging</b> and settling.

Among the six options tested with different combinations of crops, irrigation methods, and effluent application rates, the most acceptable was California grass, which was grown in plots (0. 5 acre each) surrounded by an earth berm and border-flood irrigated intermittently at an average rate of 20 in. /wk. For this option, the production of 1 mgd of recharge water requires a 14. 6 -acre plot. For all options, recharge through 3 ft of vegetated, fairly permeable soil overlying 30 ft of permeable, reef limestone rock stabilized groundwater chlorides to 245 mg/l, stripped virtually all effluent nitrogen, and inactivated effluent bacteria. Toxics analyzed (pesticides, solvents, and heavy metals) were all below action or detectable levels.

Yet evidence for clogging is incomplete, as research has focussed on identifying the presence of ash in soil; the actual flow processes remain unknown. We conducted laboratory infiltration experiments coupled with microscope observations in pure sands, saturated hydraulic conductivity analysis, and interaction energy calculations, to test whether ash can clog pores (i. e. block pores such that infiltration is hampered and ponding occurs). Although results confirmed previous observations of ash washing into pores, clogging was not observed in the pure sands tested, nor were conditions found for which this does occur. Clogging by means of strong attachment of ash to sand was deemed unlikely given the negative surface charge of the two materials. Ponding due to washing in of ash was also considered improbable given the high saturated conductivity of pure ash and ash-sand mixtures.

40|$|This {{project is}} a {{combination}} of mechanical engineering and sustainable development in developing countries. The goal has been to build a windmill driven water pump and to design a small-scale irrigation system for SCC-Vi Agroforestry’s demonstration farm in Musoma, Mara region, Tanzania. The purpose was to enable SCC-Vi Agroforestry to demonstrate and spread knowledge about these techniques to farmers in the region. In 2007, two students from Halmstad University conducted a field study in the Mara region and found that many farmers lack clean and running water. Back in Sweden they constructed a prototype of a windmill that employs wind energy to pump water using a semi-rotary pump. The intention is that local farmers should be able to build their own windmill, and thus have running water in their household. However, the windmill has never been built in Tanzania. The windmill construction in this report is based on the prototype, but the original drawings were changed to fit the specific situation in Tanzania better. Important throughout the project has been to minimise cost and to only use material that local farmers can get hold of. Building and assembling of the windmill were then performed by the authors in co-operation with local workers. The windmill drives a pump that pumps water from a well to a tank for further use in irrigation. Calculations have been made on the energy available in the wind and an energy analysis was then performed to see what wind speed is required for the system to work. If wind speed is low, the windmill can be adjusted by placing the connecting rod closer to the rotation centre where it requires less work to function. As a result of that, the volume of water per stroke will decrease and it will take longer time to fill the tank. This project was carried out during the rainy season when there is less wind; therefore the windmill has not been tested during optimal wind speed conditions. The tests that have been performed during the circumstances at the time showed that the performance of the windmill is consistent with the theoretical calculations. A proposed design for a simple drip irrigation system has been developed based on the conditions at the project area. It is constructed of plastic pipes with holes that emit water. Covers are in place to prevent <b>soil</b> from <b>clogging</b> the holes. Building the irrigation system was not part of this project...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to extend {{previous}} studies investigating the <b>clogging</b> of <b>soil</b> by ponded hog manure and to clarify the meaning and the magnitude of the "manure seal". Specific objectives are related to the effect of <b>clogging</b> upon <b>soil</b> hydraulic conductivity: to measure the effect of clogging with time, to measure the effect of clogging with depth, and to determine the effect of <b>soil</b> texture upon <b>clogging.</b> Seven <b>soils</b> were studied in column tests in a controlled environment. Hog manure was ponded on the soils for a period of 185 days and the soils were monitored for changes in apparent hydraulic conductivity, hydraulic conductivity with depth and visual alterations. The soil-manure interface was found to govern infiltration into the soil and the apparent hydraulic conductivity of the soil column. This layer was 5 mm to 7 mm thick and was a result of particulate matter in the manure <b>clogging</b> the surface <b>soil</b> pores which increased in thickness with time. Soils below this layer retained their ability to conduct flow with the exception of some reduction in hydraulic conductivity caused by small particulate matter passing through the clogged layer and air entrapment caused by fermentation. The <b>clogging</b> of the <b>soil</b> reduced the apparent hydraulic conductivity of the soil columns to less than 10 - 6 cm/s within 5 to 25 days and to less than 10 - 7 cm/s within 20 to 30 days. The time required to reduce the apparent hydraulic conductivity of the soil column was dependent on soil texture and was less for soils with less than 25 % clay content and more for soils with more than 25 % clay content...|$|R

Moura-Ficalho aquifer (MF) is a karstic-fissured aquifer made of Paleozoic carbonate rocks (dolomitic rocks and marbles) in the Alentejo region, located in south of Portugal. Beside this predicted decrease in recharge, in this aquifer the situation was increased by <b>soil</b> erosion and <b>clogging</b> of sink holes and other karstic recharge structures, so in MF decrease in recharge has been detected and, for this reason more research and measures to reverse this desertification evolution are required. The unbalanced condition of this aquifer was first detected after {{the implementation of a}} monitoring piezometric network (Costa, in ERHSA, 2001) and the calibration of a groundwater flow model using data collected from October 2000 until December 2005 (Costa, 2008). According to the transient model developed on a monthly base, by A. Costa, water recharge was not enough to compensate the water losses by the aquifer. The simulation period included one wet year (2000 / 01), three mean years (from 2001 to 2004) and a very dry year (2004 / 05). However, mean annual precipitation in these five years was 530 mm, which equals the mean annual precipitation estimated by considering long time series. Furthermore, according to predicted climate changes, the climate trends towards drier weather and so, this problem will tend to become increased, probably not only in MF but also in other karstic aquifer in southern part of Portugal. This work intends to investigate the relationship between groundwater and surface water, and to detect areas where the natural recharge is taking place and where it should be increased in order to mitigate this environmental problem. To reach this aim, several scenarios of the former groundwater modeling outputs were worked out with the help of Geographic Information System (Arc GIS). Also the subject about artificial recharge of aquifers was developed and applied to this region...|$|R
40|$|Many geoenvironmental {{applications}} {{make use}} of granular drainage layers. Design guidelines for these drains recommend a granular soil that provides for filtration of the adjacent base soil. Filtration criteria have been developed through laboratory studies in which fine soils under a concentrated gradient of water are protected from erosion by a filter soil. The primary objective in these studies has been the geotechnical stability of earth-fill structures, while drainage was a secondary consideration. Granular drainage layers have therefore been constructed using fine sand. The subsequent migration of fine soil into these drains has resulted in significant loss in permeability. The main research objective was to develop design criteria for granular drains {{to be used for}} long term operation in environmental applications. The secondary objective was to investigate the relationships between grain size distribution of drain materials and clogging by fines. This was done through a laboratory study where changes in permeability were measured in granular soils infiltrated with fines. Lastly, the effect of salinity on fines deposition was also investigated. The hypothesis of the current study is that coarser granular drains minimize the impact of clogging and provides a better alternative to traditional drain designs for long term environmental applications. The laboratory study was performed with three granular drainage soils: a French Drain sand designed using the traditional filter design method, a coarser uniform sand, and a coarser graded sand with approximately 40 % gravel sized particles. Three fine soils were used to infiltrate the drainage soils; however, their particle size distributions were not significantly different from one another. The results indicate that the permeability of all three drainage soils could be reduced by approximately one order of magnitude with continuous flow of a high concentration of fines (5 g/L). The permeabilities of the sands were reduced to a lesser extent with a lower concentration of fines. Permeabilities of the graded soils decreased more slowly with a lower concentration of fines, when considering pore volumes of flow. However, the rate of permeability decrease was ultimately influenced by the amount of fines delivered to the sample. A lower concentration of fines did not significantly slow the rate of permeability reduction in the uniform sand. All three sands retained a similar mass of fines (samples were split and fines content measured following each test). Salinity in the pore water did not significantly affect deposition, likely {{due to the fact that}} the fines contained a small amount of clay sized particles. When considering that all three drainage <b>soils</b> became <b>clogged</b> with fines during the tests, the coarse soils maintained a relatively high permeability due to the fact that their pre-test permeabilities were high. This information, along with the results from the literature review, has led to the development of recommended new design criteria for granular drains to be used for long-term geoenvironmental applications. Test results from an earlier study found that dispersive soils subject to high gradients can be successfully protected by a filter coarser than the coarse graded soil used in the current study. It therefore follows that a granular soil intended for groundwater collection applications can be made to be coarser than the current accepted practice. A proposed granular drain design band is presented in the current study...|$|R
40|$|Impact {{of erosion}} on the silting of dams, on the {{recharging}} groundwater and on coastal marine intrusion in the Mediterranean semi-arid area: Case of Boukourdane dam (Algeria). Description of the subject. Water erosion {{is a particularly}} important issue, especially in the Mediterranean and semi-arid zone. This zone is characterized by irregular rainfall patterns, which have a considerable influence on soil loss. In mountainous areas, water erosion phenomena are accentuated by steep slopes and low ground cover. The dams draining these areas undergo siltation linked to significant erosion. The silting of the dams drastically limits their capacity and thus their operating life. When used for recharging aquifers, the resuspension of fine particles may accumulate in the recharge areas and reduce infiltration capacity by <b>clogging</b> <b>soil</b> porosity. This leads to a significant reduction of groundwater levels. Additionally, groundwater situated in the coastal zone is submitted to intensive pumping. These two phenomena make groundwater particularly sensitive to marine intrusions. Objectives. This article aims, {{on the one hand}} to quantify the rate of siltation {{in the case of the}} Boukourdane dam (northern Algeria), which is used to recharge groundwater. On the other hand, the article also shows the reduction in permeability in the capturing field with the current management of releases. Method. Solid rates were set in relation to the liquid flow and sediment concentration occasionally taken from the wadi. The relation established made it possible to evaluate the solid contributions to the dam of Boukourdane. The impact of the releases on recharging the well field was evaluated by grouping wells and the well field mushrooms using heuristic k-means. Regressions were applied to the piezometric variations of each group. Results. This dam is fed by a catchment area of 156 km². Sediment transport was estimated from empirical formulas. The specific degradation rate was estimated at 366 t·km- 2 ·year- 1 during the 1993 to 2005 period. The increase in the frequency of extreme rainfall resulted in an increase in the soil erosion rate to 446 t·km- 2 ·year- 1 during the 1993 to 2013 period. The volume of sediments accumulated in the dam reached 8 · 104 m³·year- 1 and 11 · 104 m³·year- 1 respectively during these two periods. Conclusions. A change in the management of current releases has a positive impact on the partial restoration of the hydraulic conductivity and de facto, on the fight against marine intrusion...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1982 Geotextiles are {{synthetic}} fabrics {{which may}} be substituted for graded aggregate to protect ocean and coastal structures from erosion and soil instability adjacent to the structure. They are commonly used as a filter and as a structural membrane between an undisturbed sediment surface below and an erosion resistant coarse aggregate above. Geotextiles provide a cost effective alternative to graded aggregate in marine foundations. The need for rational design procedures {{has led to a}} theoretical description of the combined soil-geotextile behavior which quantifies failure potential and facilitates optimum geotextile selection. A two-dimensional analytical model has been developed for a three layered system; two different soils separated by a geotextile. The soil response is modeled by Biot consolidation theory and an unsteady form of Darcy's equation in which each soil is considered homogeneous, isotropic and linearly elastic. The soil layers are coupled through the geotextile which acts as an elastic permeable membrane. Soil displacements and stresses and fluid pressures and flows are determined analytically. Potential failure conditions are identified from the cyclic shear stress ratio and from a Mohr- Coulomb stress analysis. Two series of laboratory experiments were conducted at the Oregon State University Wave Research Facility to verify the model. The large scale facility includes a wave channel which is 12 feet wide, 15 feet deep and 342 feet long. A test section 36 feet long was constructed in the wave channel and filled with approximately three feet of fine sand, a geotextile and one foot of gravel. The test section was exposed to simple harmonic and random waves with heights up to four and one-half feet and periods to eight seconds in water depths to eight feet. The pore water pressure was monitored continuously at seven to ten soil depths and three to five lateral positions and recorded on magnetic tape along with the displacement of the free surface. Four geotextile conditions were tested including woven, impermeable, semi-rigid and no geotextile. Wave-induced liquefaction was observed for a low permeability geotextile. The experimental results verify the soil-geotextile interaction model and also provide insight into the dynamic response of horizontally layered soils. Results indicate that for the permeabilities of commonly available geotextiles that the hydraulic properties of the geotextile are dominated by the adjacent <b>soil</b> properties. However, <b>clogging</b> of the geotextile increases the potential for soil failure. The pore pressure amplitude response is frequency selective, the higher frequencies being more highly damped. For a given soil condition a "worst" wave period may exist which produces maximum failure potential. Conversely, for a given design wave, there is a "worst" combination of backfill and armor in terms of potential failure...|$|R
