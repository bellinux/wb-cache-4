5|$|A {{significant}} benefit of Operation Dragoon {{was the use}} of the port facilities in Southern France, especially the large ports at Marseille and Toulon. After Operation Cobra and Operation Dragoon, the Allied advance slowed almost to a halt in September due to a critical lack of <b>supplies.</b> <b>The</b> ports were quickly brought back into service, together with the railroad system in Southern France. Thereafter, large quantities of supplies could be moved north to ease the supply situation. In October, 524,894 tons of supplies were unloaded, which was more than one third of the Allied cargo shipped to the Western front.|$|E

25|$|Initially the bids by Bombardier and Siemens, Alstom Projects India Ltd and {{consortium}} comprising BEML, Mitsubishi and Hyundai Rotem were shortlisted to <b>supply</b> <b>the</b> {{rolling stock}} and coaches. In February 2009, the BEML-led consortium was awarded <b>the</b> contract to <b>supply</b> 150 coaches and rolling stock {{for the first}} phase of the project.

On 27 March 2017, BEML announced that it had won an 1,421 crore contract to <b>supply</b> <b>the</b> coaches.

5|$|Britain was {{the world}} leader in the {{construction}} of railways, and their use to expand trade and coal <b>supplies.</b> <b>The</b> first successful locomotive-powered line in Scotland, between Monkland and Kirkintilloch, opened in 1831. Not only was good passenger service established by the late 1840s, but an excellent network of freight lines reduce the cost of shipping coal, and made products manufactured in Scotland competitive throughout Britain. For example, railways opened the London market to Scottish beef and milk. They enabled the Aberdeen Angus to become a cattle breed of worldwide reputation.|$|E
5|$|By {{this stage}} of the insurgency, the MNLA had largely split into small groups of guerrillas, which existed by basing {{themselves}} in a chosen rural area, subverting local villagers and accumulating from them manpower and <b>supplies.</b> <b>The</b> lot of any security forces posted nearby was to play a constant game of hide-and-seek with the communists, whereby the army would indefinitely search for and destroy any base camps and food caches the MNLA set up. The Commonwealth leaders surmised that the MNLA could not possibly resist such a campaign forever, and would, in time, simply give up attempting to regroup.|$|E
5|$|Cross-river traffic {{increased}} {{following the}} establishment of the Royal Arsenal in 1671. To enable movement of troops and <b>supplies,</b> <b>the</b> army established its own ferry in 1810. The following year an Act of Parliament established a commercial ferry company, but it was dissolved in 1844. In 1846 the Eastern Counties and Thames Junction Railway extended its lines to include a Thames wharf branch; eventually three steam ferries operated, but they proved inadequate to meet the growing demand. In October 1880 a public meeting was held in Woolwich to discuss setting up a locally run steam-ferry service, but the cost was seen as prohibitive.|$|E

5|$|During the {{southern}} party's absence the relief ship Morning arrived, bringing fresh <b>supplies.</b> <b>The</b> expedition's organisers {{had assumed that}} the Discovery would be free from the ice in early 1903, enabling Scott to carry out further seaborne exploration and survey work before winter set in. It was intended that Discovery would return to New Zealand in March or April, then home to England via the Pacific, continuing its magnetic survey en route. Morning would provide any assistance that Scott might require during this period.|$|E
5|$|For {{several days}} the men {{attempted}} {{to salvage the}} tools and provisions that had been loaded on the Aimable, but a bad storm prevented them from recovering more than food, cannons, powder, and {{a small amount of}} the merchandise. The ship sank on March 7. The French watched the Karankawa loot the wreckage. As French soldiers approached the Native American village to retrieve their <b>supplies,</b> <b>the</b> villagers hid. On discovering the deserted village, the soldiers not only reclaimed the looted merchandise but also took animal pelts and twocanoes. The angry Karankawa attacked, killing twoFrenchmen and injuring others.|$|E

Before escaping from the explosion, the party encounters a dark knight whom Maria thinks she recognizes as Leon.|$|E

The preparations for Hurricane Jimena cost the American Red Cross $5,000 (2003 USD).|$|E

5|$|In 1980 AFL–CIO President Lane Kirkland {{appointed}} Kahn {{to organize}} the AFL–CIO's support of Solidarity. The AFL–CIO sought approval in advance from Solidarity's leadership, to avoid jeopardizing their position with unwanted or surprising American help. Politically, the AFL–CIO supported the twenty-one demands of the Gdansk workers, by lobbying to stop further U.S. loans to Poland unless those demands were met. Materially, the AFL–CIO established the Polish Workers Aid Fund. By 1981 it had raised almost $300,000, which was used to purchase printing presses and office <b>supplies.</b> <b>The</b> AFL–CIO donated typewriters, duplicating machines, a minibus, an offset press, and other supplies requested by Solidarity.|$|E
