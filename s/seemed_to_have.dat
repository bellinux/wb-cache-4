5|$|During {{the rule}} of the Aryacakravarti rulers, the laws {{governing}} the society was based on a compromise between a matriarchal system of society that <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> had deeper roots overlaid with a patriarchal system of governance. These laws <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> existed side by side as customary laws to be interpreted by the local Mudaliars. In some aspects such as in inheritance the similarity to Marumakattayam law of present-day Kerala and Aliyasanatana of modern Tulunadu was noted by later scholars. Further Islamic jurisprudence and Hindu laws of neighboring India also <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> affected the customary laws. These customary laws were later codified and put to print during the Dutch colonial rule as Thesavalamai in 1707. The rule under earlier customs <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been females succeeded females. But when the structure of the society came to be based on patriarchal system, a corresponding rule was recognized, that males succeeded males. Thus, we see the devolution of muthusam (paternal inheritance) was on the sons, and the devolution of the chidenam (dowry or maternal inheritance) was on the females. Just as one dowried sister succeeded another, we had the corresponding rule that if one’s brother died instate, his properties devolved upon his brothers to the exclusion of his sisters. The reason being that in a patriarchal family each brother formed a family unit, but all the brothers being agnates, when one of them died his property devolved upon his agnates.|$|E
5|$|A leucistic Coragyps atratus brasiliensis was {{observed}} in Piñas, Ecuador in 2005. It had white plumage overall, with only the tarsus and tail {{as well as some}} undertail feathers being black. It was not an albino as its skin <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> had the normal, dark color and {{it was part of a}} flock of some twenty normally plumaged individuals.|$|E
5|$|As of mid-day Monday, August 29, {{the eye of}} Hurricane Katrina passed east of the City {{subjecting}} it to hurricane wind conditions, but sparing New Orleans {{the worst}} impact. The City <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> escaped most of the catastrophic wind damage and heavy rain that had been predicted. Most buildings came through well structurally.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, {{the price of}} uranium had fallen, {{and the costs of}} nuclear power had risen, and the anti-nuclear {{movement}} <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> won its case. The Campaign Against Nuclear Energy disbanded itself in 1988, two years after the Chernobyl Disaster.|$|E
5|$|Even in {{his early}} years, Linnæus <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a liking for plants, flowers in particular. Whenever he was upset, {{he was given a}} flower, which {{immediately}} calmed him. Nils spent much time in his garden and often showed flowers to Linnaeus and told him their names. Soon Linnæus was given his own patch of earth where he could grow plants.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{influenced}} {{him with}} certain moral principles, though Gandhi {{himself had been}} influenced by The Kingdom of God Is Within You, a nonviolent classic written by Christian anarchist Leo Tolstoy. In turn, both Gandhi and Martin Luther King had read Tolstoy, and King, Gandhi and Tolstoy had been strongly influenced by Jesus' Sermon on the Mount. King quoted Tolstoy's War and Peace in 1959.|$|E

5|$|Sviatoslav {{has long}} been a hero of Belarusian, Russian, and Ukrainian patriots due to his great {{military}} successes. His figure first attracted attention of Russian artists and poets during the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774), which provided obvious parallels with Sviatoslav's push towards Constantinople. Russia's southward expansion and the imperialistic ventures of Catherine II in the Balkans <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been legitimized by Sviatoslav's campaigns eight centuries earlier.|$|E

25|$|Prothesis {{generally}} did {{not apply}} to short *a (which developed into *o or nasal *ǫ), although some East Slavic dialects <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> developed it regardless. There <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been some uncertainty concerning the interpretation of long *ā as a rounded or unrounded vowel. Prothesis <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> applied intermittently <b>to</b> it; when it does apply *ā- → *jā- is frequent, but *ā- → *vā- is also found.|$|R

5|$|Artificial ruins, {{built to}} {{resemble}} remnants of historic edifices, {{were also a}} hallmark of the period. They were usually built as centre pieces in aristocratic planned landscapes. Follies were similar, although they differed from artificial ruins in that they were not part of a planned landscape, but rather <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> no reason for being built. Both drew on elements of castle architecture such as castellation and towers, but served no military purpose and were solely for display.|$|E
5|$|Both studios now faced rival projects, {{which could}} {{undercut}} their own long-term financial stability and plans. Columbia had no consistent movie franchise, and had sought Spider-Man since 1989; MGM/UA’s only reliable source of theatrical income {{was a new}} James Bond film {{every two or three}} years. An alternate 007 series could diminish or even eliminate the power of MGM/UA’s long-running Bond series. Likewise, an MGM/UA Spider-Man film could negate Columbia’s plans to create an exclusive cash cow. Both sides <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> strong arguments for the rights to do such films.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} months of 1930 Aiello {{arranged}} several unsuccessful assassination attempts against Capone bodyguards, including Jack McGurn, Phil D'Andrea and Rocco De Grazia. Aiello hoped to leave Capone vulnerable by depleting his security, and Capone began to suspect Aiello had spies within the Chicago Outfit because he <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> inside knowledge about where his targets would be and when. In August 1930, two months before Aiello's death, the state's attorney conducted a raid on Aiello's home, obtaining records as part of a series of raids by the United States government to fight against gangland activities in Chicago.|$|E

5|$|Everyone I {{talked to}} <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a {{relative}} {{or a friend}} who'd been through it. That was the other thing – everyone reacts to the problem differently so there's no textbook way of playing Ruth in her present situation. In fact, the way I'm playing her now might surprise some people because in the past she's been such a strong character and here she is collapsed and weeping and thinking the worst. Occasionally you may suggest to the script editor that you don't think your character will react a certain way, but with Ruth I have absolute trust in the scriptwriter's characterisation.|$|E
5|$|He {{was dressed}} in a strange way. A šajkača was pulled to the front of his head and almost {{completely}} covered his forehead. His eyebrows were hardly visible. Under its weight, the ears <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> collapsed. He wore a kind of long, black coat, covered in mud and held in place by a string. He used another piece of string for a belt, and from it hung a pot for boiling water, a tea strainer, a canteen, and other useful things. He walked slightly bent forward, followed everywhere by the noise of the things clashing at his waist.|$|E
5|$|Hoping {{to punish}} Basarab, King Charles I mounted a {{military}} campaign {{against him in}} 1330. The king marched to Severin and took it from Basarab. The voivode asked for a truce, offering to refund 7,000 silver marks for {{the costs of the}} army, and showed himself ready to continue paying tribute to the king and send his son as a hostage to the royal court. But the king refused and advanced with his host into Wallachia where everything <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been laid waste.|$|E

5|$|Lancaster’s main ally was Guy Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick. Warwick was {{the most}} fervently and {{consistently}} antagonistic of the earls, and remained so until his early death in 1315. Other earls were more amenable. Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, was Gaveston’s brother-in-law and stayed loyal to the king. Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke, would later {{be one of the}} king’s most central supporters, yet at this point he found the most prudent course of action was {{to go along with the}} reformers. Of the barons, at least Robert Clifford and William Marshall <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> royalist leanings.|$|E

His Vision Racing teammate, Ed Carpenter also earned a career best start with the 2nd best qualifying time. However, both cars failed technical inspection, meaning they had {{to start at the}} rear of the field. Foyt drove his No. 2 entry from the last position (25th) to a ninth-place finish in the race.|$|E

30|$|It can be {{seen that}} the four {{analyses}} just outlined differ a lot. Nevertheless, the non-uniqueness theory considers all of them to be legitimate, because each <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> its own advantage. For example, the “finest” analysis <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the best phonemic economy (although it assumes an oversized syllable structure), and the CVX analysis <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the most consistent syllable structure (although it has the largest consonant inventory). There <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be no consistent set of criteria that all approaches can be measured against.|$|R
