According to the global authority on nature conservation, International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the sea turtles of the Hawaiian Islands were also once under the threat of near extinction, but are now thriving and their conservation status reclassified as [...] "Least Concern" [...] according to the IUCN Red List. [...] Thus, Yeh established Sea Turtles 911 under Hawaiian jurisdiction, and changed the course of his life by returning to China to save the sea turtles he had hopelessly witnessed being sold. Building a floating sea turtle hospital in a Chinese fishing village known for its extensive sea turtle poaching, Yeh makes a point to work with people of all types to support sea turtle conservation in the area, including government officials, academia, fishermen and poachers, community members, local and international volunteers. At a sea turtle release event held at the Ritz-Carlton, Sanya, Yeh stated, [...] "For our release events, if we can bring multiple sectors in our community together, it will be very beneficial to sea turtle conservation in China. It is my hope that we can put other issues aside and agree on sea turtle rights, for the advancement of sea turtle conservation." [...] Local community members, including fishermen and coast guard police, describe Yeh as a true [...] "Haigui" [...] or a [...] "returning sea turtle," [...] and defer to his expertise when endangered sea turtles are rescued and in need of medical attention.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Solar salinas are {{man-made}} systems {{exploited for}} {{the extraction of}} salt, by solar and wind evaporation of seawater. Salt production achieved by traditional methods is associated with landscapes and environmental and patrimonial values generated throughout history. Since the mid-twentieth century, this activity has been facing a marked decline in Portugal, with most salinas either abandoned or subjected to destruction, making it necessary to find a strategy to reverse this trend. It is, however, possible to generate revenue from salinas at several levels, not merely in terms of good quality salt production, but also by obtaining other products that can be commercialized, or by exploring their potential for tourism, and as research facilities, among others. Furthermore, with an adequate management, biodiversity can be restored to abandoned salinas, which constitute important feeding and breeding grounds for resident and migratory aquatic birds, {{many of which are}} protected by European Community Directives. The aims of this manuscript are to present a brief overview on the current <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>sea</b> salt exploitation in Portugal and to stress the importance of recovering these salinas for the conservation of this particular environment, for the regional economy, the scientific community and the general public. The Aveiro salina complex is presented in detail, to exemplify salina structure and functioning, as well as current problems and potential solutions for artisanal salinas. </p...|$|E

While most climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP 5) archive simulate {{a decrease in}} Antarctic sea ice area over the recent past, whether these models can be dismissed as being wrong depends on {{more than just the}} sign of change compared to observations. We show that internal sea ice variability is large in the Antarctic region, and both the observed and modeled trends may represent natural variations along with external forcing. While several models show a negative trend, only a few of them actually show a trend that is significant compared to their internal variability on the time scales of available observational data. Furthermore, the ability of the models to simulate the mean <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>sea</b> ice is also important. The representations of Antarctic sea ice in CMIP 5 models have not improved compared to CMIP 3 and show an unrealistic spread in the mean state that may influence future sea ice behavior. Finally, Antarctic climate and sea ice area will be affected not only by ocean and air temperature changes but also by changes in the winds. The majority of the CMIP 5 models simulate a shift that is too weak compared to observations. Thus, this study identifies several foci for consideration in evaluating and improving the modeling of climate and climate change in the Antarctic region...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge of the {{physical}} characteristics and chemical composition of marine organic aerosols is needed for the quantification of their effects on solar radiation transfer and cloud processes. Global emission estimates of marine organic aerosol are {{in a range of}} 2 to 70 Tg yr− 1 and occur over regions most susceptible to aerosol perturbations. This review examines research pertinent to the chemical composition, size distribution, mixing state, emission mechanism, and climatic impact of marine primary organic aerosols associated with sea spray. Numerous measurements have shown that both the ambient mass concentration of marine organic aerosol and size-resolved organic mass fraction of sea spray aerosol are related to surface ocean biological activity. Recent studies have also indicated that fine mode (smaller than 200 nm in diameter) marine organic aerosols can have a size distribution independent from sea-salt, while coarse mode aerosols (larger than 1000 nm in diameter) {{are more likely to be}} internally-mixed with sea-salt. Climate studies have found that marine organic aerosols can cause large local increases in the cloud condensation nuclei concentration, with the potential to have a non-negligible influence on the anthropogenic aerosol indirect forcing. Despite these signs of climate-relevance for marine organic aerosols, the source strength, chemical composition, mixing state, hygroscopicity, cloud droplet activation potential, atmospheric aging, and removal of marine organic aerosols remain poorly quantified.

However, several studies {{indicate}} that perennial sea ice initiated at least 18 ‒ 13 Myrs ago which {{emphasizes the importance of}} understanding climate forcings and feedbacks through the Miocene (23 ‒ 5 Myrs). In more detail, changes in CO 2 might have varied between preindustrial levels (278 parts per million, ppm) and 500 ppm. Furthermore, the control of northward water mass transport by active changes of the Greenland-Scotland Ridge (GSR) sill depth might has affected the actual <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>sea</b> ice (perennial vs. seasonal) in the Arctic. Here, we investigate the sensitivity of sea ice to GSR depth and CO 2 changes by means of a fully coupled ocean-atmosphere General Circulation Model (GCM) with integrated terrestrial vegetation dynamics (community of earth system models, COSMOS). The model setup comprise a global reconstruction of the mid-Miocene 20 ‒ 15 Myrs ago (continental geography, orography, bathymetry, ice-sheet geography and topography) and a change of CO 2 levels in the atmosphere. Especially, we additionally integrated a high resolution bathymetric dataset for the northern North Atlantic, GSR, Nordic Seas and the Eurasian Basin. Independently, within the range of CO 2 reconstructions and different ocean depth settings of the Greenland-Scotland Seaway the model is capable to reproduce perennial as well as seasonal Arctic ice cover. Based on our results, we conclude that sea ice within the Miocene climate was variable and highly sensitive to different forcings mechanisms. ...|$|E

More specifically, parent lipids {{and some of their}} oxidation products were quantified in suspended (collected by filtration) and sinking (collected with sediment traps at 5 and 30 m) particles from Resolute Passage (Canada) during a period of spring ice melt in 2012 and the outcomes compared with those obtained from related sea ice samples analyzed previously. Our data show that suspended cells in the near surface waters appeared to be only very weakly affected by photooxidative processes, likely indicative of a community of unaggregated living cells with high seeding potential for further growth. In contrast, we attribute the strong photooxidation state of the organic matter in the sediment traps deployed at 5 m to the presence of senescent and somewhat aggregated sea ice algae that descended only relatively slowly within the euphotic zone, and was thus susceptible to photochemical degradation. On the other hand, the increased abiotic preservation of the sinking material collected in the sediment traps deployed at 30 m, likely reflected more highly aggregated senescent sea ice algae that settled sufficiently rapidly out of the euphotic zone to avoid significant photooxidation. This better-preserved sinking material in the deeper sediment traps may therefore contribute more strongly to the underlying sediments. A three-component conceptual scheme summarizing the abiotic behavior of Arctic sea ice algae in underlying waters is propose...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} the first template for estimating relative sea level curves and their associated uncertainties. More specifically, the thesis estimates the changing <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>sea</b> {{level in the}} Humber estuary, UK, {{over the course of}} the Holocene. These estimates are obtained through Bayesian methods involving Gaussian processes. Part of the task involves collating data sources from both archaeologists and geologists which have been collected during frequent study of the region. A portion of the thesis is devoted to studying the nature of the data, and the adjustment of the archaeological information so it can be used in a format suitable for estimating former sea level. The Gaussian processes are used to model sea-level change via a correlation function which assumes that data points close together in time and space should be at a similar elevation. This assumption is relaxed by incorporating non-stationary correlation functions and aspects of anisotropy. A sequence of models are fitted using Markov chain Monte Carlo. The resultant curves do not pre-suppose a functional form, and give a comprehensive framework for accounting for their uncertainty. A further complication is introduced as the temporal explanatory variables are stochastic: they arise as radiocarbon dates which require statistical calibration. The resulting posterior date densities are irregular and multi-modal. The spatio-temporal Gaussian process 2 model takes account of such irregularities via Monte Carlo simulation. The resultant sea-level curves are scrutinised at a number of locations around the Humber over a selection of time periods. It is hoped that they can provide insight into other areas of sea-level research, and into a broader palaeoclimate framework...|$|E

Climate change displacement is predicted to affect approximately 200 million people by 2050. The enormity of climate change displacement demands financial resources that vulnerable populations lack.

There is also large uncertainty regarding the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>sea</b> ice cover in the mPWP. Evidence for both perennial and seasonal mPWP Arctic sea ice is found through analyses of marine sediments, whilst in a multi-model ensemble of mPWP climate simulations, half of the ensemble simulated ice-free summer Arctic conditions. Given the strong influence that sea ice exerts on high latitude temperatures, {{an understanding of the}} nature of mPWP Arctic sea ice would be highly beneficial. Using the HadCM 3 GCM, this paper explores the impact of various combinations of potential mPWP orbital forcing, atmospheric CO 2 concentrations and minimum sea ice albedo on sea ice extent and high latitude warming. The focus is on the Northern Hemisphere, due to availability of proxy data, and the large data–model discrepancies in this region. Changes in orbital forcings are demonstrated to be sufficient to alter the Arctic sea ice simulated by HadCM 3 from perennial to seasonal. However, this occurs only when atmospheric CO 2 concentrations exceed 300 ppm. Reduction of the minimum sea ice albedo from 0. 5 to 0. 2 is also sufficient to simulate seasonal sea ice, with any of the combinations of atmospheric CO 2 and orbital forcing. Compared to a mPWP control simulation, monthly mean increases north of 60 ◦N of up to 4. 2 ◦C (SST) and 9. 8 ◦C (SAT) are simulated. With varying CO 2, orbit and sea ice albedo values we are able to reproduce proxy temperature records that lean towards modest levels of high latitude warming, but other proxy data showing greater warming remain beyond the reach of our model. This highlights the importance of additional proxy records at high latitudes and ongoing efforts to compare proxy signals between sites...|$|E

The salt-mass distributions of sea-salt particles, ranging from 10 ^- 11 gm to 10 ^- 7 gm are obtained by combined use of hand-operated impactors and rod samplers. The vertical distribution of sea-salt particles in the lowest several meters above the sea surface can be expressed by a modified form of Toba 2 ̆ 7 s equilibrium theory of sea-salt particles, by introducing the effective relative humidity. The feature of the mean salt-mass distribution of the number concentration of sea-salt particles, θ, at a height of 6 m for each wind force, for the salt-mass class of log m ≦ 2. 25 (m : the salt mass in 10 ^- 12 gm unit), is close to a straight-line segment on a logarithmic diagram, and it is expressed, as the first approximation, by Junge 2 ̆ 7 s form concerning the size distribution of aerosols in the atmosphere. It is found that the number concentration of sea-salt particles, θ, increases linearly on a logarithmic diagram with a dimensionless variable, u_*L/ν, which represents the overall degree of the breaking of wind waves, where u_*is the friction velocity, L the significant wave length and ν the kinematic viscosity of air. The reference level of the production of sea-salt particles, z_ 1 -surface, is newly introduced, and the number concentration of sea-salt particles at the z_ 1 -surface, θ_ 1 is discussed. The character of the salt-mass distribution of θ_ 1 is always almost same, even though the wind speed and the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>sea</b> surface may change, and the absolute value of θ_ 1 is proportional to u_*L/ν. The production rate of sea-salt particles, F_ 1, at the z_ 1 -surface {{can be obtained from}} the value of θ_ 1 by F_ 1 = w_sθ_ 1, where w_s represents the terminal velocity of sea-water droplet.

In conclusion, the values of θ_ 1 and F_ 1 are presented for each class of salt mass as a function of u_*L/ν.
