5|$|A BT46 {{competed in}} 'B' {{specification}} {{once again in}} 1979 in the Gunnar Nilsson Trophy race at Donington Park. This was an event held {{to raise funds for}} the Gunnar Nilsson Cancer Fund. Originally intended as a non-championship Formula One race, without FIA sanction it was instead run in a time trial format, with victory going to the fastest <b>single</b> <b>lap</b> recorded. As it was not an FIA event, the car's illegality was not a factor. Nelson Piquet drove, coming fourth of the five cars competing.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the race, all the cars lined up on the grid per FIA race procedure. As Charlie Whiting signalled the green light to start the {{formation}} lap, a full field of twenty cars set off as normal for a <b>single</b> <b>lap</b> before forming the starting grid. At the banked Turn 13, the entrance to the pit lane (and the turn that was the centre of the controversy), all teams that ran Michelin tyres returned to their pits, leaving just six cars from the three Bridgestone teams (Ferrari, Jordan, and Minardi) to start the race.|$|E
50|$|The 2013 {{season was}} the first season using the Generation 6 race car, the Car of tomorrow's successor, and marked the return to the {{qualifying}} procedure that was used before the 2005 season. However, at the two road courses on the schedule drivers qualified in groups instead of <b>single</b> <b>laps.</b> In September 2012, NASCAR removed a ban introduced in the 2008 season on testing at tracks that were {{on any of the}} premier series' schedules, replacing it with a testing limit.|$|R

Jimmy Spencer and Jeremy Mayfield each also led a <b>single</b> <b>lap</b> during the long green-flag period that ended on lap 107 when Dan Pardus hit the wall in turn two. Gordon had been leading {{at the time of}} the caution; he lost the lead to rookie Kenny Irwin, Jr. during pit stops, and Irwin retained the lead after the resumption of racing on lap 110, leading 15 laps in total until being passed by Gordon on lap 123 on account of having a flat tire, just before the caution came out once again for a rain shower.|$|E

5|$|The {{championship}} resumed {{three weeks}} later in China, with the lead-in period to the race marked by Lotus F1 protesting the legality of Mercedes's rear wing design. The FIA rejected the protest, and with Mercedes allowed to continue racing with their car unchanged, Nico Rosberg took his – and the team's – first pole position since their return to Formula One in , while a penalty to Lewis Hamilton for a gearbox change promoted Michael Schumacher to second on the grid. Schumacher would ultimately retire from the race {{after the first round}} of stops when it was discovered that one of his wheels had not been attached properly. Rosberg took an early lead in the race, and while his attempt to complete the race with only two pit stops came under threat from second-placed Jenson Button, a mistake by Button's pit crew during his final stop handed Rosberg a nineteen-second advantage over Kimi Räikkönen. Räikkönen was attempting a similar two-stop strategy, but his tyres wore out seven laps {{from the end of the}} race, and he lost eleven positions in a <b>single</b> <b>lap.</b> This forced Rosberg to drive conservatively to preserve his tyres while Button recovered from his disastrous pit stop to pass Sebastian Vettel for second. Button was held up by the incumbent World Champion long enough for Rosberg to preserve his tyres, and he became the 103rd person to win a Grand Prix. The result was also Mercedes's first win as a constructor since Juan Manuel Fangio won the 1955 Italian Grand Prix. Button was second, with Hamilton scoring his third consecutive third place, giving him a two-point championship lead over Button; Fernando Alonso, who had been leading the championship before the race, finished ninth. After two retirements in the opening rounds of the championship, Romain Grosjean scored his first points in Formula One by finishing sixth.|$|E

Sowing is an apt name for this activity, since not only are many games traditionally played with seeds, but placing seeds one at a time in different holes reflects the physical act of sowing. If the sowing action stops after dropping the last seed, the game is considered a <b>single</b> <b>lap</b> game.|$|E
25|$|The {{race was}} won by Bill Elliott in the No. 11 Ford for Junior Johnson and Associates. Owner-driver Alan Kulwicki, driving the No. 7 Ford, {{finished}} second behind Elliott, and secured the series title {{by virtue of}} having led the most laps during the race. It was the closest points championship battle in NASCAR history at the time (10 points), and Kulwicki's margin of most laps led compared to Elliott's total was a mere <b>single</b> <b>lap.</b>|$|E

50|$|The season saw the {{introduction}} of a revised qualifying system: after two timed qualifying sessions, the sixteen fastest riders were admitted to the newly created Superpole, which determined the first four rows of the starting grid; during this session each rider went on the track in reverse qualifying order to take a <b>single</b> flying <b>lap.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Italians {{continued}} to dominate their race after the war, now again on a <b>single</b> big <b>lap</b> through Italy. Mercedes made another good effort in 1952 with the underpowered Mercedes-Benz 300 SL Gullwing, scoring second with the German crew Karl Kling/Hans Klenk that {{later in the}} year would win the Carrera Panamericana. Caracciola, in a comeback attempt, was fourth.|$|R
25|$|Allison would mathematically {{clinch the}} {{championship}} if he finished sixth or better, {{regardless of the}} other five drivers' performances. If Allison were to lead a <b>single</b> <b>lap</b> during the race, {{all he had to}} do was finish 7th or better; if he had led the most laps, he needed only to finish 8th or better. Numerous other championship scenarios generally favored Allison, provided he finished ahead of his competitors, and led a lap during the race. Allison led second-place Alan Kulwicki by 30 points and Bill Elliott by 40.|$|E
25|$|Points {{were awarded}} {{for the first}} ten places but the amounts changed during the series' run: 15 for the winner, 12 for second place, 10 for third place, 8 for fourth place, 6 for fifth place, 5 for sixth place, and so on with 4, 3, 2, and one point for tenth place. Points were awarded in a {{different}} way for the Sprint Race: 10 for the winner, counting down 8, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 point for eighth place. In addition, one point was awarded to the team that set the fastest <b>single</b> <b>lap</b> time in either the Sprint or Main Race. Cash prizes were also awarded.|$|E
25|$|For {{much of the}} sport's history, {{qualifying}} sessions differed {{little from}} practice sessions; drivers would have one or more sessions in which to set their fastest time, with the grid order determined by each driver's best <b>single</b> <b>lap,</b> with the fastest on pole position. Grids were generally limited to 26 cars – if the race had more entries, qualification would also decide which drivers would start the race. During the early 1990s, the number of entries was so high that the worst-performing teams had to enter a pre-qualifying session, with the fastest cars allowed through to the main qualifying session. The qualifying format began {{to change in the}} late 1990s, with the FIA experimenting with limiting the number of laps, determining the aggregate time over two sessions, and allowing each driver only one qualifying lap.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{tightening}} torques {{on the life}} of plates bolted using <b>single</b> and double <b>lap</b> joints was investigated. The effect of plate thickness using an aircraft grade aluminium alloy with double lap joints was also studied. Constant amplitude fatigue tests, under load control, were carried out, with a near zero stress ratio, on plain specimens (for bench mark purposes) and on both <b>single</b> and double <b>lap</b> joint specimens, for which several torque levels were applied on the bolted joints. The objective of the fatigue tests was to demonstrate failure trends for each joint type, material thickness and torque loading, rather than the generation of comprehensive S-N curves. Possible factors that affected the fatigue life of the bolted joints are discussed and conclusions are drawn with respect to the beneficial effects of tightening torques on the bolted <b>single</b> and double <b>lap</b> joints.

25|$|During {{its final}} years, the Minardi team {{was almost as}} famous for its {{politics}} as its racing. Stoddart was described as the Formula One teams' unofficial shop steward. During his time as team principal, Stoddart campaigned for reduced costs in the sport. He appealed to the competing car manufacturers for an agreement where the independent (and, on the whole, financially weaker) teams in Formula One would get cheaper engine deals than at present. In return, the team principals who would benefit from this would support the works teams {{when it came to}} opposing new rule changes enforced by the FIA, such as the proposed ban on traction control. Before the start of the 2004 season, however, Stoddard threatened to withdraw his support against the ban on traction control, but later changed his mind. Midway through the 2004 season, the other teams voted to change the unpopular <b>single</b> <b>lap</b> qualifying system back to the old 1 hour format, but Stoddart voted against because it would also mean the 107% rule being reintroduced; this meant the change never occurred, as a unanimous vote was required to change something so significant {{in the middle of a}} season. Before the 2005 Australian Grand Prix Stoddart initially threatened to withdraw his cars if they were made to comply with the revised regulations for 2005. Stoddart claimed that Minardi could not afford to adapt their cars. Once again Stoddart ended up withdrawing his threat. Stoddart has also repeatedly called for the resignation of the FIA's President, Max Mosley, particularly in the aftermath of the 2005 United States Grand Prix where the majority of teams withdrew from the race due to safety concerns about their Michelin tyres. While Minardi had run Bridgestone tyres, Stoddart had offered to compromise with the Michelin teams but Mosley had rejected it.|$|E

During the race's qualifying session, Schumacher {{had one of the}} quickest times during the first session and was fastest in the second session; but a fuel pressure problem prevented him from completing a <b>single</b> <b>lap</b> during the third session, forcing him to start the race in tenth position. Early in the race Schumacher moved up to sixth place. However, in overtaking Alonso's teammate, Giancarlo Fisichella, Schumacher experienced a tyre puncture caused by the front wing of Fisichella's car. Schumacher pitted and consequently fell to 19th place, 70 seconds behind teammate and race leader Felipe Massa. Schumacher recovered and overtook both Fisichella and Räikkönen to secure fourth place. His performance was classified in the press as [...] "heroic", an [...] "utterly breath-taking drive", and a [...] "performance that... sums up his career".|$|E

Tournament mode consists of four single races in each tournament; the player who earns the most points wins. Time trials and speed laps involve obtaining the fastest time in either three laps or a <b>single</b> <b>lap.</b> The final race mode is called [...] "Zone Mode", in which survival is the goal, as the player's ship increasingly accelerates to extreme speeds. In addition to the five race modes, Wipeout HD provides a [...] "Photo Mode", which can be activated after the player completes a race.
