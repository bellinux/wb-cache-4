5|$|In the 1970s, {{a lawsuit}} {{challenging}} this segregation {{led to a}} 1983 settlement agreement in which St. Louis County school districts agreed to accept black <b>students</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> city on a voluntary basis. State funds were used to transport students to provide an integrated education. The agreement also called for white <b>students</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> county to voluntarily attend city magnet schools, {{in an effort to}} desegregate the City's remaining schools. Despite opposition from state and local political leaders, the plan significantly desegregated St. Louis schools; in 1980, 82 percent of black students in the city attended all-black schools, while in 1995, only 41 percent did so. During the late 1990s, the St. Louis voluntary transfer program was the largest such program in the United States, with more than 14,000 enrolled students.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{increasingly}} dire military outlook, Nasjonal Samling's {{position at the}} head of the government, albeit with its ambiguous relationship to the Reichskommissariat, remained unassailable.
