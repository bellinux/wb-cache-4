40|$|Achieving high {{performance}} {{is one of}} the most difficult challenges in designing digital circuits. Flip-flops and adders are key blocks in most digital systems and must therefore be designed to yield highest performance. In this thesis, a new {{high performance}} <b>serial</b> <b>adder</b> is developed while power consumption is attained. Also, a statistical framework for the design of flip-flops is introduced that ensures that such sequential circuits meet timing yield under performance criteria. Firstly, a high performance <b>serial</b> <b>adder</b> is developed. The new adder is based on the idea of having a constant delay for the addition of two operands. While conventional adders exhibit logarithmic delay, the proposed adder works at a constant delay order. In addition, the new adder's hardware complexity is in a linear order with the word length, which consequently exhibits less area and power consumption as compared to conventional high performance adders. The thesis demonstrates the underlying algorithm used for the new adder and followed by simulation results. Secondly, this thesis presents a statistical framework for the design of flip-flops under process variations in order to maximize their timing yield. In nanometer CMOS technologies, process variations significantly impact the timing performance of sequential circuits which may eventually cause their malfunction. Therefore, developing a framework for designing such circuits is inevitable. Our framework generates the values of the nominal design parameters; i. e., the size of gates and transmission gates of flip-flop such that maximum timing yield is achieved for flip-flops. While previous works focused on improving the yield of flip-flops, less research was done to improve the timing yield in the presence of process variations...|$|E

In our research {{we focus on the}} effective utilization of the SET technologys specific characteristic, i. e., the ability to control the transport of individual electrons. We pursue two main research directions: Single Electron Encoded Logic (SEEL) and Electron Counting (EC) arithmetic. All the design we propose are verified by means of simulation and evaluated in terms of area, delay and energy consumption. The first line of research, i. e., the SEEL paradigm, is based on encoding Boolean variables as a net charge of zero or one electron thus charge transport in a SEEL gate due to switching activity is limited to one electron. Within the SEEL paradigm we first propose a generic Threshold Logic Gate (TLG) from which we derive a Boolean logic gate family. Subsequently, we investigate the behavior of the SEEL TLG as a network component, argue that buffering is a method to reduce crosstalk problems and propose four SEEL buffers. A buffer choice is argued, based on TLG buffering suitability, and subsequently utilized to implement buffered Boolean gates. We next explore SEEL implementations of memory elements and propose static latches, flip-flops and dynamic memory elements. Given the above components, i. e., SEEL Boolean gates, threshold gates and memory elements, we propose building blocks for <b>serial</b> <b>adders,</b> ripple carry adders, carry-lookahead adders and tree multipliers and evaluate the above adders and multipliers. The second line of research, i. e., the EC paradigm, is based on encoding integer values as charge and performing arithmetic operations on charge encoded operands.
