5|$|Wilfrid's {{association}} with Cædwalla may have benefited him in other ways: the Life of Wilfrid {{asserts that the}} Archbishop of Canterbury, Theodore, expressed a wish that Wilfrid <b>succeed</b> <b>him</b> in that role, {{and if this is}} true it may be a reflection of Wilfrid's {{association with}} Cædwalla's southern overlordship.|$|E

5|$|During {{his time}} in Sussex Wilfrid was {{reconciled}} with Archbishop Theodore; the Vita Sancti Wilfrithi says that Theodore expressed a desire for Wilfrid to <b>succeed</b> <b>him</b> at Canterbury.

5|$|King John I {{accepted}} Ottoman suzerainty in 1529, {{but in the}} Treaty of Nagyvárad of 1538 {{he conceded}} {{the right of the}} Habsburgs to <b>succeed</b> <b>him</b> after his death.

Mandela and the Executive supported Jacob Zuma, a Zulu who had been imprisoned on Robben Island, as Mbeki's replacement for Deputy President. Zuma's candidacy was challenged by Winnie, whose populist rhetoric had gained her a strong following within the party, although Zuma defeated her in a landslide victory vote at the election.|$|E
