40|$|Organisms {{can respond}} to and cope with {{stressful}} environments {{in a number of}} ways including behavioural, morphological and physiological adjustments. To understand the role of behavioural traits in thermal adaptations we compared heat resistance, locomotor (walking and flying) activity, flight performance and morphology of three European populations of Musca domestica (Diptera: Muscidae) originating from different thermal conditions (Spain, Switzerland and Denmark) at benign and stressful high temperatures. <b>Spanish</b> <b>flies</b> showed greater heat resistance than Swiss and Danish flies. Similarly, at the stressful high temperature <b>Spanish</b> <b>flies</b> flew the furthest and Danish flies the shortest distance. Neither body size nor wing loading affected flight performance, although flies with narrower wings tended to fly further (wing shape effect). Swiss flies were most active in terms of locomotor activity at the benign temperature, whereas the <b>Spanish</b> <b>flies</b> were able to stay active for longer at the stressful temperature. Population differences in behavioural traits and heat resistance were obtained using flies held for several generations in a laboratory common garden setting; therefore we suggest that exposure to and avoidance of high temperatures under natural conditions has been an important selective agent causing the suggested adaptive differentiation between the populations...|$|R

As a child, her stepmother enforced strict discipline and an austere life of labor. [...] She was not allowed to have any friends, and if she was caught talking to people not approved by Livia, she was punished. (Graves describes an occasion, which is probably fiction, when a commoner introduces himself to Julia, and Julia has her hair cut off by Livia as punishment.) [...] Livia's cruelty is due to her desire for her line to rule (Tiberius and his descendants), not Julia's, as Julia was from Augustus's previous marriage. [...] Julia's behaviour resulted from Livia's and her son (Julia's 3rd husband) Tiberius' mistreatment of her. [...] Tiberius not being sexually attracted because of her womanly curves (preferring nymph-like women), Livia has Julia take <b>Spanish</b> <b>Fly</b> to try and seduce Tiberius, which leads to her sexual appetite. In the end, Livia manages to turn even Augustus against Julia and, as historical fact proves, she was sent into exile. Augustus initially allows Livia to select the island, and Julia was sent to tiny Pandataria. He later relents and asks where she is; upon discovering that she is stuck on that desolate, tiny isle, he selects the pleasant town of Reggio off the strait of Messina instead.|$|E

It was verified that {{the contribution of the}} alkaline-earth elements in the original composition is fundamental to easily obtain glass-ceramics with a fine microstructure which improves the mechanical properties. Otherwise, with a small addition of Ay ash and without dolomite, very stable glassy materials were obtained that did not exhibit any visible etching either in water or in acid media. Therefore, the combined vitrification/devitrification technique is a suitable methodology for the recycling and exploitation of coal fly ash. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
