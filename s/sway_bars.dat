50|$|An {{anti-roll}} bar (roll <b>bar,</b> anti-sway <b>bar,</b> <b>sway</b> <b>bar,</b> stabilizer bar) {{is a part}} of many automobile suspensions that helps reduce the body roll of a vehicle during fast cornering or over road irregularities. It connects opposite (left/right) wheels together through short lever arms linked by a torsion spring. A <b>sway</b> <b>bar</b> increases the suspension's roll stiffness—its resistance to roll in turns, independent of its spring rate in the vertical direction. The first stabilizer bar patent was awarded to Canadian inventor Stephen Coleman of Fredericton, New Brunswick on April 22, 1919.|$|R
2500|$|Car and Driver {{declared}} [...] "Even {{the most}} jaded car critics {{are in fact}} tripping over each other {{trying to be the}} first to anoint this sedan to be the best full-sized Chevrolet ever made."

These links work in tandem with the coil springs, dampers, and <b>sway</b> <b>bar</b> to control all six degrees of freedom of the axle. The upper links (orange) and the lower links (yellow) work in tandem to control the pitch, yaw and the fore and aft movement (surge). The panhard rod (green) controls the left and right movement (sway). While the springs and dampers (not shown) control the up and down movement (heave) and the roll is controlled by the <b>sway</b> <b>bar</b> (also not shown).|$|R

2500|$|After the season, an ugly {{controversy}} {{emerged with}} Jack Roush of Roush Fenway Racing, who accused MWR of stealing {{one of his}} team's <b>sway</b> <b>bars</b> after a September 2007 race. [...] While Waltrip and some other drivers, such as Jeff Gordon, argued that parts are often inadvertently swapped during post-race inspection, Roush held a lengthy news conference in March 2008 to accuse [...] "the non-descript Toyota team" [...] (MWR) of deliberately stealing the bar and threatened legal action. [...] However, Roush, who had previously accused Toyota teams of being [...] "ankle-biting Chihuahuas" [...] and brought up Pearl Harbor {{in his effort to}} keep Toyota out of NASCAR, did not pursue such a lawsuit as NASCAR declared that the Toyota teams did nothing wrong and that Roush's ideas against Toyota were ridiculous.|$|E
2500|$|The Ion Red Line is an {{overlooked}} GM performance car, as the Saturn brand was not {{marketed as}} selling high-performance vehicles. [...] The Red Line claims a 0–60mph time of 6.0 seconds, and a 1/4 mile time of 14.1 seconds. [...] GM Performance re-tuned {{the spring and}} bushing rates, and reduced the ride height by about 10mm, and added larger 4-wheel disc brakes. The car was also equipped with 17-inch forged alloy wheels and Dunlop Sport SP9000 [...] 215/45 tires, thicker performance <b>sway</b> <b>bars,</b> re-valved shock absorbers, and Recaro racing seats.
