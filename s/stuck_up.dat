25|$|Killer or German {{skittles}}: A {{game for}} any number of people. Each starts with 3 lives. Each bowls only one ball at a time. The first bowls at a full frame and the skittles are not <b>stuck</b> <b>up</b> until all nine are hit down. Each time a player fails to hit a single pin (but they can hit as many as they like), he or she loses a life. The winner is the last one left with a life intact. Usually played for money, e.g. £1 or 50p a game each player - the winner takes the pot. Found in the Somerset and Bristol areas.|$|E
25|$|In 1815 CE, Purnananda Burhagohain, the Prime Minister of Ahom kingdom, sent a {{deputation}} {{to arrest}} Badan Chandra Borphukan, the Ahom viceroy at Guwahati, who was charged for atrocities committed {{on the people}} of Lower Assam, but, being warned in time by his daughter, Pijou Gabharu, who had married one of the Premier’s sons, he escaped to Bengal. He proceeded to Calcutta, and alleging that Purnananda Burhagohain was subverting the Ahom Government and ruining the country, endeavored to persuade the Governor-General Lord Hastings to dispatch an expedition against Purnananda Burhagohain. Lord Hasting, however, refused to interfere in any way. Meanwhile Badan Chandra had <b>stuck</b> <b>up</b> a friendship with the Calcutta Agent of the Burmese government and he went with this man to the Court of Amarapura, where he was accorded an interview with the Burmese king, Bodawpaya. He repeated his misrepresentations regarding the conduct of Purnananda Burhagohain, alleging that he had usurped the King's authority, and that owing to his misgovernment, the lives of all, both high and low, were in danger. At last he obtained a promise of help. Towards {{the end of the year}} 1816 an army of about eight thousand men under the command of General Maha Minhla Minkhaung was dispatch from Burma with Badan Chandra Borphukan. It was joined en route by the chiefs of Mungkong, Hukong and Manipur, and, by the time Namrup was reached, its number had swollen to about sixteen thousand. Purnananda Burhagohain sent an army to oppose the invaders. A battle was fought at Ghiladhari in which the Assamese army was routed. At this juncture Purnananda Burhagohain died or some say, committed suicide by swallowing diamonds, leaving the entire Ahom government leaderless. His eldest son, Ruchinath was appointed as Burhagohain. The Ahom war council decided to continue the war; and a fresh army was hastily equipped and sent to resist the Burmese. Like the former one, it was utterly defeated, near Kathalbari east of Dihing. The Burmese continued their advance pillaging and burning the villages along their line of march. Ruchinath Burhagohain endeavored in vain to induce the reigning Ahom monarch Chandrakanta Singha to retreat to Guwahati, and then, perceiving that the latter intended to sacrifice him, in order to conciliate Badan Chandra and his Burmese allies, fled westwards to Guwahati.|$|E

In her book Neighbours: The First 10 Years, Josephine Monroe wrote that Charlene did not like to be patronised and had a sharp tongue. Monroe observed that Charlene's feisty side helped endure her to viewers. In keeping with her tomboyish nature, Charlene trained as a mechanic after leaving school and got an apprenticeship with Rob Lewis (Ernie Bourne). The character's style often consisted of khaki overalls, baggy sweatshirts and her hair set in a perm. A reporter for the Daily Mail said this look helped to launch Minogue [...] "into the public eye" [...] as Charlene.|$|E

500|$|Pick {{introduced}} a common advertising policy, improving {{the appearance of}} stations by standardising poster sizes, limiting the number used and controlling their positioning. Before he took control of advertising, posters had been <b>stuck</b> <b>up</b> on any available surface on station buildings and platform walls in a crowded jumble of shapes and sizes that led to complaints from passengers {{that it was difficult}} to find the station name. Pick standardised commercial poster sizes on printers' double crown sheets, arranging these in organised groups to enable the station name to be easily seen. The Underground's own promotional posters were smaller, using single or paired double royal sheets, and were arranged separately from the commercial advertising. Pick described the process: [...] "after many fumbling experiments I arrived at some notion of how poster advertising ought to be. Everyone seemed quite pleased and I got a reputation that really sprang out of nothing." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{spinster}} {{for many}} years, Mavis resisted the advances of men, often {{too shy to}} allow dating to progress beyond {{the initial stages of}} courtship. Ian Randall comments that [...] "Many a man has been smitten with Mavis Riley, but unfortunately she always seemed to attract the drippier of the male species". In 1976 a love interest was introduced for Mavis in the form of Derek Wilton (Peter Baldwin), {{but it was more than}} a decade before the couple finally married in 1988, after simultaneously jilting each other four years earlier. Barbara Knox, who plays Rita, said, [...] "She [...] was quite a tough little character. You know, a lot of girls would have gone through with , and she stuck to her guns and said 'No, no this isn't right.' Again, dithering and weepy, but she was tough enough to do it. That scene [...] is reflective of the two of them. That was the essence of the friendship, they <b>stuck</b> <b>up</b> for each other and [...] great friends, all the way through." ...|$|E
500|$|Classic Coronation Street was a {{recreation}} of 1960s Coronation Street. It starred Wood as the show's gossiping Ena Sharples, with Julie Walters as Martha Longhurst and Lill Roughley as Minnie Caldwell, with Ena telling them the [...] "gossip" [...] she has {{heard about the}} show's plotlines {{for the next two}} decades.

500|$|Leno {{began to}} drink heavily after performances, and, by 1901, {{like his father}} and {{stepfather}} before him, he had become an alcoholic. He gradually declined physically and mentally and displayed frequent bouts of erratic behaviour that began to affect his work. By 1902, Leno's angry and violent behaviour directed at fellow cast members, friends and family had become frequent. Once composed, he would become remorseful and apologetic. His erratic behaviour was often {{a result of his}} diminishing ability to remember his lines and inaudibility in performance. Leno also suffered increasing deafness, which eventually caused problems on and off stage. In 1901, during a production of Bluebeard, Leno missed his verbal cue and, as a result, was left <b>stuck</b> <b>up</b> a tower for more than twenty minutes. At the end of the run of Mother Goose in 1903, producer Arthur Collins gave a tribute to Leno and presented him, on behalf of the Drury Lane Theatre's management, with an expensive silver dinner service. Leno rose to his feet and said: [...] "Governor, it's a magnificent present! I congratulate you and you deserve it!" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{head was}} often {{displayed}} on London Bridge, for centuries the route by which many travellers {{from the south}} entered the city. [...] Several eminent commentators remarked on the displays. [...] In 1566 Joseph Justus Scaliger wrote that [...] "in London there were many heads on the bridge... I have seen there, {{as if they were}} masts of ships, and at the top of them, quarters of men's corpses". [...] In 1602 the Duke of Pommerania-Stettin emphasised the ominous nature of their presence when he wrote [...] "near the end of the bridge, on the suburb side, were <b>stuck</b> <b>up</b> the heads of thirty gentlemen of high standing who had been beheaded on account of treason and secret practices against the Queen". [...] The practice of using London Bridge in this manner ended following the hanging, drawing and quartering in 1678 of William Staley, a victim of the fictitious Popish Plot. [...] His quarters were given to his relatives, who promptly arranged a [...] "grand" [...] funeral; this incensed the coroner so much that he ordered the body to be dug up and set upon the city gates. [...] Staley's was the last head to be placed on London Bridge.|$|E

[...] Guitarist Darren Middleton says of Coghill [...] "Jon likes movies with explosions in them", and has also described him as stubborn. Fellow guitarist Ian Haug says Coghill is an excellent arranger, explaining [...] "he can listen to it all, just sort of sit back and go, 'Okay, that's a really good bit.'" [...] Coghill himself has described himself as a [...] "superhero". He has also stated that he shares the band's hatred of band photos. Coghill says he shares the stereotype of drummers being the most [...] "out there" [...] member of the band. He says this is true because [...] "We have so much energy...We’re <b>stuck</b> <b>up</b> the back and we’re more likely to do stupid shit to get rid of it."

Despite her high school popularity – the character {{is the most popular}} girl at Middleton High School, along with Bonnie Rockwaller – Kim is not <b>stuck</b> <b>up</b> and remains very much devoted to her academics, being a straight-A student. However, her reputation as [...] "a brainiac" [...] does not harm her popularity. The character's intellect counters negative stereotypes commonly associated with cheerleaders; she often incorporates her cheerleading routines into battle.< Meanwhile Bonnie, who is described as [...] "Kim's polar opposite", is depicted as [...] "a typical cheerleader", reflecting what Kim [...] "could have become". A running gag, Bonnie constantly complains about Kim's tardiness for cheerleading practice due to her tasking job. Described by Tracey McLoone of PopMatters as [...] "clever, as well as graceful and physically fit", the character also disproves the belief that brawn is superior to brains in battle. However, Kim is not a tomboy, and exhibits personality traits and interests typically associated with teenage girls, including shopping and fangirling over popular trends. Flawed, the character also has a tendency to come off as judgmental, jealous and overly competitive at times. Her best female friend Monique represents [...] "Kim’s bridge between the world of super-spy, superhero action, and the world of high school, and stuff teen girls care about", keeping the character [...] "grounded". Despite her confidence as a young woman, Kim remains very much concerned about her love life, which is sometimes treated as one of her weaknesses. Mike McDaniel of the Houston Chronicle joked that [...] "Nothing's impossible with Kim Possible -- except maybe landing a date." [...] Feminist Fairytales observed that Kim [...] "contain a ide range of differences in one person". Much of the character's dialogue consists of [...] "not-so-typical teen slang" [...] including [...] "So not the drama" [...] and [...] "No big", as well as her signature catchphrase [...] "What's the sitch?".|$|E

2500|$|Kelly began {{associating with}} bushranger Harry Power. According to The Singleton Argus, on 16 March 1870, Power and Kelly <b>stuck</b> <b>up</b> and robbed a Mr McBean. Later that year on 2 May, Kelly {{was charged with}} robbery in company and accused of being Power's accomplice. The victims could not {{identify}} Kelly and the charges were dismissed. He was then charged with armed robbery, but the principal witness could not be located and the charges were dismissed. He was then charged a third time, for a hold-up with Power against a man named Murray. Although the victims for the third charge {{were reported to have}} also failed to identify Kelly, they had in fact been refused a chance to identify him by Superintendents Nicolas and Hare. Instead, Superintendent Nicolas told the magistrate that Kelly fitted the description and asked for him to be remanded to the Kyneton court for trial. Instead of being sent to Kyneton, he was sent to Melbourne where he spent the weekend in the Richmond lock-up before transferring to Kyneton. No evidence was produced in court, and he was released after a month. Historians tend to disagree over this episode: Some see it as evidence of police harassment; others believe that the Kelly family intimidated the witnesses, making them reluctant to give evidence. Another factor in the lack of identification may have been that the witnesses had described Power's accomplice as a [...] "half-caste". However, Superintendent Nicolas and Captain Standish believed this {{to be the result of}} Kelly going unwashed.|$|E
