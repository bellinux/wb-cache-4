25|$|The second-wave bands {{broadened the}} music's scope, with the {{introduction}} of new and diverse musical influences into the <b>sound.</b> <b>Record</b> labels such as Nervous and Crazy Love helped the genre to expand, although it still remained largely unnoticed in the United States, where the albums were poorly distributed and most psychobilly bands preferred to play weekenders than to tour. Nick 13 states that while other British youth trends such as scooter riding, the skinhead subculture, and 2 Tone ska crossed over to the United States during the 1980s, psychobilly did not.|$|E

2500|$|Porter {{served for}} four years as the chief {{engineer}} under guitarist and producer Atkins. Porter became the engineer big-name artists wanted to work with, and he was influential in creating the Nashville <b>sound.</b> <b>Record</b> producer Owen Bradley once asked Atkins how he got his sound, and Atkins said, [...] "it was Bill Porter." [...] He recorded more than 579 records that charted—49 were top 10, 11 were number one, and 37 were certified gold records. Most were recorded at what is now RCA's Studio B in Nashville, where Porter {{was responsible for the}} sound. (At the time, there was only one studio, with no letter designation. In 1964, a more modern studio was added to the building, and the earlier one became known as [...] "Studio B".) The studio's acoustics were problematic, with resonant room modes creating an uneven frequency response. To lessen the problem, Porter took $60 from the studio's petty cash and bought [...] fiberglass acoustic ceiling panels which he and Tommy Strong, his assistant engineer, cut into triangles and hung from the ceiling at varying heights; these were called [...] "Porter Pyramids".|$|E
