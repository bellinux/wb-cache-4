50|$|<b>Sinigrin</b> is a {{glucosinolate}} {{that belongs}} {{to the family of}} glucosides found in some plants of the Brassicaceae family such as Brussels sprouts, broccoli, and the seeds of black mustard (Brassica nigra). Whenever sinigrin-containing plant tissue is crushed or otherwise damaged, the enzyme myrosinase degrades <b>sinigrin</b> to a mustard oil (allyl isothiocyanate), which is responsible for the pungent taste of mustard and horseradish. Seeds of white mustard, Sinapis alba, will give a much less pungent mustard because this species contains a different glucosinolate, sinalbin.|$|E
50|$|The {{glucosinolate}} <b>sinigrin,</b> among others, {{was shown}} {{to be responsible for}} the bitterness of cooked cauliflower and Brussels sprouts. Glucosinolate have been shown to alter animal eating behavior.|$|E
50|$|Gluconasturtiin {{is named}} from its {{occurrence}} in watercress (Nasturtium officinale). Among the vegetables, {{it is also}} found in horseradish (Armoracia rusticana) along with <b>sinigrin.</b> Both compounds elicit a pungent taste.|$|E
50|$|Sinalbin is a {{glucosinolate}} {{found in}} the seeds of white mustard, Sinapis alba, and in many wild plant species. In contrast to mustard from black mustard (Brassica nigra) seeds which contain <b>sinigrin,</b> mustard from white mustard seeds has only a weakly pungent taste.|$|E
5000|$|Allyl isothiocyanate can be {{obtained}} from the seeds of black mustard (Brassica nigra) or brown Indian mustard (Brassica juncea). When these mustard seeds are broken, the enzyme myrosinase is released and acts on a glucosinolate known as <b>sinigrin</b> to give allyl isothiocyanate.|$|E
50|$|Mixing ground {{mustard seeds}} with water causes a {{chemical}} reaction between two compounds in the seed: the enzyme myrosinase and various glucosinolates such as <b>sinigrin,</b> myrosin, and sinalbin. The myrosinase enzyme turns the glucosinolates into various isothiocyanate compounds known generally as mustard oil. The concentrations of different glucosinolates in mustard plant varieties, and the different isothiocyanates that are produced, make different flavors and intensities.|$|E
50|$|Another {{way to gain}} allyl cyanide is to use rat {{intestinal}} microbiota. By adding <b>sinigrin</b> to rat {{intestinal microbiota}} and subsequent incubation under anaerobe conditions, this will lead to desulfosinigrin. Further incubation yields allyl cyanide as the major degradation product. More degradation products are isothiocyanate and 1-cyano-2,3-epithiopropane.

50|$|The intact {{horseradish}} root has hardly any aroma.

50|$|Overcooking will {{render the}} buds gray and soft, and they then develop a strong flavor and odor that some dislike.

For taste, roasting Brussels sprouts is a common way to cook them to bring out flavor. Common toppings or additions for Brussels sprouts include Parmesan cheese and butter, balsamic vinegar, apple cider vinegar, bacon, pistachios, pine nuts, mustard, brown sugar, chestnuts or pepper. Another popular way of cooking Brussels sprouts is to sauté them.|$|E
50|$|Ascorbate is a known {{cofactor}} of myrosinase, {{serving as}} a base catalyst in glucosinolate hydrolysis.For example, myrosinase isolated from daikon (Raphanus sativus) demonstrated an increase in V max from 2.06 µmol/min per mg of protein to 280 µmol/min per mg of protein on the substrate, allyl glucosinolate (<b>sinigrin)</b> when {{in the presence of}} 500 µM ascorbate.Sulfate, a byproduct of glucosinolate hydrolysis, has been identified as a competitive inhibitor of myrosinase.In addition, 2-F-2-deoxybenzylglucosinolate, which was synthesized specifically to study the mechanism of myrosinase, inhibits the enzyme by trapping one of the glutamic acid residues in the active site, Glu 409.|$|E
50|$|These are {{generally}} mustard oils, which {{are characterized by}} a burning taste; their principal occurrence is in mustard and Tropaeolum seeds. <b>Sinigrin,</b> or the potassium salt of inyronic acid not only occurs in mustard seed, but also in black pepper and in horseradish root. Hydrolysis with baryta, or decomposition by the ferment myrosin, gives glucose, allyl mustard oil and potassium hydrogen sulfate. Sinalbin occurs in white pepper; it decomposes to the mustard oil, glucose and sinapin, a compound of choline and sinapic acid. Jalapin or scammonin occurs in scammony; it hydrolyses to glucose and jalapinolic acid.|$|E
5000|$|Cabbage aphids {{produce a}} {{myrosinase}} (beta-thioglucoside glucohydrolase) enzyme in head and thoracic muscles; the aphids also uptake glucosinolates, particularly <b>sinigrin,</b> from the plants {{on which they}} feed, storing the glucosinolates in their haemolymph. (Glucosinolates are natural defenses for plants in the order Brassicales against pests and herbivores.) The combination of the glucosinolates and the myrosinase enzyme produces a violent chemical reaction that releases the mustard oil chemical allyl isothiocyanate. The defense mechanism has a dramatic {{negative effect on the}} survival of the larval ladybird predator Adalia bipunctata. The chemical defence of the aphids has been likened to a [...] "walking mustard oil bomb".|$|E
50|$|The pungency of the {{condiment}} mustard {{results when}} {{ground mustard seeds}} are mixed with water, vinegar, or other liquid (or even when chewed). Under these conditions, a chemical reaction between the enzyme myrosinase and a glucosinolate known as <b>sinigrin</b> from the seeds of black mustard (Brassica nigra) or brown Indian mustard (Brassica juncea) produces allyl isothiocyanate. By distillation one can produce a very sharp-tasting essential oil, sometimes called volatile oil of mustard, containing more than 92% allyl isothiocyanate. The pungency of allyl isothiocyanate {{is due to the}} activation of the TRPA1 ion channel in sensory neurons. White mustard (Brassica hirta) does not yield allyl isothiocyanate, but a different and milder isothiocyanate.|$|E

50|$|The {{name was}} {{originally}} given to plant products of this nature, {{in which the}} other part of the molecule was, in the greater number of cases, an aromatic aldehydic or phenolic compound (exceptions are <b>sinigrin</b> and jalapin or scammonin).

Much attention has been given to the non-sugar parts (aglyca) of the molecules; the constitutions of many have been determined, and the compounds synthesized; and in some cases the preparation of the synthetic glucoside effected.|$|E
40|$|As it {{pertains}} to insect herbivores, the preference-performance hypothesis posits that females will choose oviposition sites that maximize their offspring’s fitness. However, both genetic and environmental cues contribute to oviposition preference, and occasionally “oviposition mistakes” occur, where insects oviposit on hosts unsuitable for larval development. Pieris virginiensis is a pierine butterfly native to North America that regularly oviposits on an invasive plant, Alliaria petiolata, but the caterpillars are unable to survive. Alliaria petiolatahas high concentrations of the glucosinolate <b>sinigrin</b> in its tissues, {{as well as a}} hydroxynitrile glucoside, alliarinoside. We investigated <b>sinigrin</b> as a possible cause of mistake oviposition, and <b>sinigrin</b> and alliarinoside as possible causes of larval mortality. We found that <b>sinigrin</b> applied to leaves of Cardamine diphylla, a major host of P. virginiensis that does not produce <b>sinigrin,</b> had no effect on oviposition rates. We tested the effect of <b>sinigrin</b> on larval performance using two host plants, one lacking <b>sinigrin</b> (C. diphylla) and one with <b>sinigrin</b> naturally present (Brassica juncea). We found no effect of <b>sinigrin</b> application on survival of caterpillars fed C. diphylla, but <b>sinigrin</b> delayed pupation and decreased pupal weight. On B. juncea, <b>sinigrin</b> decreased survival, consumption, and caterpillar growth. We also tested the response of P. virginiensis caterpillars to alliarinoside, a compound unique to A. petiolata, which was applied to B. oleracea. We found a significant reduction in survival, leaf consumption, and caterpillar size when alliarinoside was consumed. The ‘novel weapon’ alliarinoside likely is largely responsible for larval failure on the novel host A. petiolata. <b>Sinigrin</b> most likely contributes to the larval mortality observed, however, we did not observe any effect of <b>sinigrin</b> on oviposition by P. virginiensis females.

40|$|A {{hollow fiber}} {{microdialysis}} sampling coupled online to ion-pair liquid chromatography was investigated {{as an alternative}} to sample pretreatment for the direct determination of <b>sinigrin</b> in cruciferous vegetables without desulfation. After microdialysis, the dialysate was online injected into the chromatographic system to analyze the <b>sinigrin</b> with UV detection at 227 nm. Parameters affecting the microdialysis efficiency, such as flow rate, polarity modifier, pH in perfusion stream, pH, and salt added in sample solution, were studied. Through ion suppression in the donor phase and ion-pair formation in the acceptor phase, the microdialysis efficiency of <b>sinigrin</b> was enhanced. Experimental results revealed that the microdialysis of a sample solution (pH 2. 0) using 0. 1 M tetrabutylammonium (pH 12) as a perfusate at 10 mu L/min flow rate maximized the extraction efficiency.

40|$|Allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), {{which occurs}} in many common cruciferous vegetables, was {{recently}} {{shown to be}} selectively delivered to bladder cancer tissues through urinary excretion and to inhibit bladder cancer development in rats. The present investigation was designed {{to test the hypothesis}} that AITC-containing cruciferous vegetables also inhibit bladder cancer development. We focused on an AITC-rich mustard seed powder (MSP- 1). AITC was stably stored as its glucosinolate precursor (<b>sinigrin)</b> in MSP- 1. Upon addition of water, however, <b>sinigrin</b> was readily hydrolyzed by the accompanying endogenous myrosinase. This myrosinase was also required for full conversion of <b>sinigrin</b> to AITC in vivo, but the matrix of MSP- 1 had no effect on AITC bioavailability. <b>Sinigrin</b> itself was not bioactive, whereas hydrated MSP- 1 caused apoptosis and G 2 /M phase arrest in bladder cancer cell lines in vitro. Comparison between hydrated MSP- 1 and pure <b>sinigrin</b> with added myrosinase suggested that the anticancer effect of MSP- 1 was derived principally, if not entirely, from the AITC generated from <b>sinigrin.</b> In an orthotopic rat bladder cancer model, oral MSP- 1 at 71. 5 mg/kg (<b>sinigrin</b> dose of 9 μmol/kg) inhibited bladder cancer growth by 34. 5 % (P < 0. 05) and blocked muscle invasion by 100 %. Moreover, the anticancer activity was associated with significant modulation of key cancer therapeutic targets, including vascular endothelial growth factor, cyclin B 1 and caspase 3. On an equimolar basis, the anticancer activity of AITC delivered as MSP- 1 appears to be more robust than that of pure AITC. MSP- 1 is thus an attractive delivery vehicle for AITC and it strongly inhibits bladder cancer development and progression...|$|E
40|$|Alliaria petiolata (garlic mustard, Brassicaceae) {{contains}} the glucosinolate <b>sinigrin</b> {{as well as}} alliarinoside, a γ-hydroxynitrile glucoside structurally related to cyanogenic glucosides. <b>sinigrin</b> may defend this plant against {{a broad range of}} enemies, while alliarinoside confers resistance to specialized (glucosinolate-adapted) herbivores. Hydroxynitrile glucosides and glucosinolates are two classes of specialized metabolites, which generally do not occur in the same plant species. Administration of [UL- 14 C]-methionine to excised leaves of A. petiolata showed that both alliarinoside and <b>sinigrin</b> were biosynthesized from methionine. The biosynthesis of alliarinoside was shown not to bifurcate from <b>sinigrin</b> biosynthesis at the oxime level in contrast to the general scheme for hydroxynitrile glucoside biosynthesis. Instead, the aglucon of alliarinoside was formed from metabolism of <b>sinigrin</b> in experiments with crude extracts, suggesting a possible biosynthetic pathway in intact cells. Hence, the alliarinoside pathway may represent a route to hydroxynitrile glucoside biosynthesis resulting from convergent evolution. Metabolite profiling by LC-MS showed no evidence of the presence of cyanogenic glucosides in A. petiolata. However, we detected hydrogen cyanide (HCN) release from <b>sinigrin</b> and added thiocyanate ion and benzyl thiocyanate in A. petiolata indicating an enzymatic pathway from glucosinolates via allyl thiocyanate and indole glucosinolate derived thiocyanate ion to HCN.

40|$|Cruciferous vegetables, such as Brassica, {{which contain}} {{substantial}} quantities of glucosinolates, {{have been suggested}} to possess anticarcinogenic activity. Cutting and chewing of cruciferous vegetables releases the thioglucosidase enzyme myrosinase, which degrades glucosinolates to isothiocyanates and other minor metabolites. Cooking of cruciferous vegetables inactivates the myrosinase enzyme, allowing intact glucosinolates to reach the large intestine, {{where they can be}} degraded by the indigenous microflora into isothiocyanates.

A method was developed to extract <b>sinigrin</b> from whole Brassica j uncea tissues. The optimal time of extraction wi th boiling phosphate buffer (0. 7 mM, pH= 6. 38) and methanol/water (70 : 30 v/v) solutions were both 25 minutes. Methanol/water extracted 13 % greater amount of <b>sinigrin</b> than phosphate buffer solution. Degradation of <b>sinigrin</b> in boiling phosphate buffer solution (0. 13 %/minute) was similar to the loss of <b>sinigrin</b> during the extraction procedure. The loss of <b>sinigrin</b> from boiling methanol/water was estimated to be O. Ol%/minute. Brassica juncea extract clean up was accomplished by an ion-pair solid phase extraction (SPE) method. The recovery of <b>sinigrin</b> was 92. 6 % and coextractive impurities were not detected in the cleaned up extract. Several high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods were developed for the determination of <b>sinigrin.</b> All the developed methods employed an isocratic mobile phase system wi th a low concentration of phosphate buffer solution, ammonium acetate solution or an ion-pair reagent solution. A step gradient system was also developed. The method involved preconditioning the analytical column with phosphate buffer solution and then switching the mobile phase to 100 % water after sample injection. <b>Sinigrin</b> and benzyl-glucosinolate were both studied by HPLC particle beam negative chemical ionization mass spectrometry (HPLCPB- NCI-MS). Comparison of the mass spectra revealed the presence of fragments arising from the ~hioglucose moiety and glucosinolate side-chain. Variation in the slnlgrin concentration within Brassica juncea plants was studied (Domo and Cutlass cuItivars). The <b>sinigrin</b> concentration in the top three leaves was studied during growth of each cultivar. For Cutlass, the minimum (200 ~ 100 ~g/g) and maximum (1300 ~ 200 ~g/g) concentrations were observed at the third and seventh week after planting, respectively. For Domo, the minimum (190 ~ 70 ~g/g) and maximum (1100 ~ 400 ~g/g) concentrations were observed at the fourth and eighth week after planting, respectively. The highest <b>sinigrin</b> concentration was observed in flower tissues 2050 ± 90 ~g/g and 2300 ± 100 ~g/g for Cutlass and Domo cultivars, respectively. Physical properties of AITC were studied. The solubility of AITC in water was determined to be approximately 1290 ~g/ml at 24 °C. An HPLC method was developed for the separation of degradation compounds from aqueous AITC sample solutions. Some of the degradation compounds identified have not been reported in the literature: allyl-thiourea, allyl-thiocyanate and diallyl-sulfide. In water, AITC degradation to' diallyl-thiourea was favored at basic pH (9. 07) and degradation to diallyl-sulfide was favored at acidic pH (4. 97). It wap necessary to amend the aqueous AITC sample solution with acetonitrile ?efore injection into the HPLC system. The acetonitrile amendment considerably improved AITC recovery and the reproducibility of the results. The half-life of aqueous AITC degradation at room temperature did not follow first-order kinetics. Beginning with a 1084 ~g/ml solution, the half-life was 633 hours. Wi th an ini tial AITC concentration of 335 ~g/ml the half-life was 865 hours. At 35 °C the half-life AITC was 76 + 4 hours essentially independent of the iiisolution pH over the range of pH= 4. 97 to 9. 07 (1000 ~g/ml). AITC degradation was also studied in soil at 35 °C; after 24 hours approximately 75 % of the initial AITC addition was unrecoverable by water extraction. The ECso of aqueous AITC against the root-lesion nematode (Pratylenchus penetrans) was determined to be approximately 20 ~g/ml at one hour exposure of the nematode to the test solution. The toxicological study was also performed with a myrosinase treated Brassica juncea extract. Myrosinase treatment of the Brassica juncea extract gave nearly quantitative conversion of <b>sinigrin</b> into AITC. The myrosinase treated extract was of the same efficacy as an aqueous AITC solution of equivalent concentration.

The most abundant glucosinolate in mustard, leaf mustard, kale, and radish was <b>sinigrin.</b> In leaf mustard, the <b>sinigrin</b> content ranged from 193. 05 μmol/g to 215. 52 μmol/g, and in mustard, the <b>sinigrin</b> contents of blue mustard and red mustard were 219. 08 μmol/g and 215. 73 μmol/g, respectively. Kale and radish contained 137. 79 μmol/g and 120. 25 μmol/g, respectively, of <b>sinigrin.</b> Gluconapin was the most abundant glucosinolate in winter turnip rape, at 121. 17 μmol/g. Chinese cabbage contained mostly glucocochlearin (79. 88 μmol/g). These results will be useful in the development of environmentally friendly plant-based pesticides by allowing for proper control of glucosinolates based on those present in the chosen plant species. ...|$|E

As a desirable cruciferous plant, Ethiopian mustard (Brassica carinata A. Braun) and its glucosinolate <b>sinigrin</b> were tested in the in vivo Drosophila melanogaster (SMART) and the in vitro HL 60 (human promyelocytic leukaemia cell line) systems. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of plant samples confirmed the presence of <b>sinigrin</b> as principal B. carinata glucosinolate. SMART was performed by feeding D. melanogaster larvae either with different concentrations of plant/compound samples or combining them with hydrogen peroxide (a potent oxidative mutagen) being both antimutagenics. HL 60 assays showed the tumoricidal activity of plant samples (IC = 0. 28 mg·mL) and the breakdown products of <b>sinigrin</b> hydrolysis (IC = 2. 71 μM). Our results enhance the potential of B. carinata as health promoter and chemopreventive in both systems and the leading role of <b>sinigrin</b> in these effects.

40|$|Although within-plant {{variation}} in the nutrient and allelochemical composition of phloem sap has been invoked to explain patterns of host use by phloem-feeding insects, {{little is known about}} within-plant {{variation in}} phloem chemistry. Here I describe a new technique in which I use the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae Sulz., to investigate within-plant {{variation in the}} concentrations of chemicals in the phloem sap of black mustard, Brassica nigra (L.) Koch (Cruciferae). Relationships between the concentrations of chemicals in aphid diets and honeydew were established using honeydew from aphids fed on artificial diets with known concentrations of amino acids, sucrose, and <b>sinigrin.</b> These relationships were applied to honeydew from aphids fed on different aged leaves of black mustard to estimate the concentrations of the chemicals in phloem sap. <b>Sinigrin</b> concentration was estimated to be high (> 10 mM) in phloem sap in young leaves, calling into question the prevailing opinion that phloem sap contains only low concentrations of allelochemicals. High concentrations may function as defenses against sap-feeding herbivores. Within-plant variation in phloem sap composition was high: (1) young leaves had high concentrations of nutrients (216 mM amino acids, 26 % sugar) and <b>sinigrin</b> (> 10 mM); (2) mature and presenescent leaves had lower concentrations of nutrients (77 – 83 mM amino acids, 19 – 20 % sugar) and low concentrations of <b>sinigrin</b> (1 – 2 mM); and (3) senescing leaves had high concentrations of nutrients (199 mM amino acids, 25 % sugar) and low concentrations of <b>sinigrin</b> (3 mM) ...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo foi {{investigar}} a influência da sinigrina no comportamento de busca e seleção do predador Orius insidiosus (Say, 1832) (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) pela presa Plutella xylostella (L., 1758) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae). Foi avaliado o desenvolvimento, reprodução e preferência de O. insidiosus predando lagartas de P. xylostella alimentadas com sinigrina. Foi possível observar que os predadores que consumiram lagartas alimentadas com folhas de couve pulverizadas com sinigrina na concentração de 1, 6 mg/mL apresentaram período ninfal mais curto, menor consumo de presas e também menor viabilidade ninfal. Os predadores adultos consumiram maior número de presas que ingeriram sinigrina e a exposição à substância proporcionou maior fertilidade de ovos. Quando os predadores entraram em contato com a sinigrina por meio da superfície pulverizada, a substância estimulou o consumo na fase ninfal, não apresentando influência negativa em outros aspectos biológicos da fase adulta. No segundo ínstar e na fase adulta, os predadores preferiram presa que ingeriram sinigrina; no terceiro e no quarto ínstar ocorreu preferência por lagartas que não ingeriram a substância e no quinto não ocorreu preferência. A seleção pelos predadores que tiveram experiência prévia com presas que ingeriram singrina, em geral, não foi influenciada pela substância. Em casa telada, a longevidade dos adultos e o consumo de presas foram menores quando os predadores foram alimentados com lagartas criadas com folhas pulverizadas com sinigrina. Com base nestes resultados é possível concluir que a sinigrina tem influência sob a preferência e o consumo de presas pelo predador em laboratório, no entanto, em casa telada, a sinigrina tem efeitos não favoráveis ao predador O. inisidiosusThe aim was {{to investigate}} the influence of <b>sinigrin</b> in search behavior and prey selection of predator Orius insidiosus (Say, 1832) (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) by Plutella xylostella (L., 1758) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae). We evaluated the development, reproduction and preference of O. insidiosus preying P. xylostella caterpillars fed on kale leaves treated with <b>sinigrin.</b> It was observed that the predators that consumed caterpillars fed on kale leaves sprayed with <b>sinigrin</b> at concentration of 1. 6 mg / mL, showed nymphal period shorter, smaller prey consumption and also lower nymphal survival. When the predators contacted the <b>sinigrin</b> throught the sprayed surface, it was stimulated the consumption of prey to the nymphal stage, moreover, showed no negative influence on the biological aspects of adults. In the second larvae instar and adult, predators preferred prey fed on leaves treated with <b>sinigrin,</b> on the third and fourth instar occurred preference by larvae that not ingesting the substance and fifth instar there was no preference. Predators that had previous experience with prey fed on kale leaves treated with <b>sinigrin,</b> in general, were not affected in the process of selection prey. Under greenhouse conditions, the longevity of adults and prey consumption were lower when predators were fed caterpillars reared on leaves sprayed with <b>sinigrin.</b> Based on these results we conclude that the <b>sinigrin</b> has influence on the preference and prey consumption by the predator in the laboratory. However, under greenhouse conditions <b>sinigrin</b> has not unfavorable effects to the predator O. insidiosu...|$|E
