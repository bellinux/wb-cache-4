5|$|Alice and Meg have {{received}} Falstaff's letters. They compare them, <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> identical and, together with Mistress Quickly and Nannetta Ford, resolve to punish Falstaff. Meanwhile, Ford has been {{warned of the}} letters by Bardolfo and Pistola. All three are thirsty for revenge and are supported by Dr Caius and Fenton, a young gentleman. To Ford's disapproval, Fenton {{is in love with}} Nannetta. Finding a moment to be alone, the young lovers exchange banter. They are interrupted by the return of Alice, Meg and Mistress Quickly. The act ends with an ensemble in which the women and the men separately plan revenge on Falstaff.|$|E
25|$|Aboard the TARDIS, the Doctor and Rose reminisce {{about their}} travels {{in front of}} Mickey, who feels left out. Suddenly the TARDIS is jolted and comes to a sudden stop. The Doctor tells them they have fallen out of the time vortex and that the TARDIS's power cell is dead. The Doctor fears they are trapped in the Void, but Mickey opens the TARDIS doors to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> in London. Heading outside to look, they quickly realise {{that they are in}} London on a {{parallel}} Earth. The Doctor finds a small power cell in the TARDIS that still works, and he energises it with some of his own lifeforce. The cell needs time to recharge, so they decide to explore the alternate world. Rose is shocked to see a billboard with her father's picture on it, and the Doctor warns her not to seek him out because he is not her real father. Mickey decides to head off on his own and try to find his grandmother, who died in his universe. The Doctor and Rose discover that most of the population of London wear EarPod devices that feed information directly into the wearer's brain.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} noticed that [...] "Anyone could <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> really great friends and their genuine {{connection}} is what translates {{into the music}} they create together." [...] After working with The Smeezingtons on Unorthodox Jukebox, Jeff Bhasker admitted that [...] "One of their great talents {{is that they have}} this fun, light vibe in the studio", something that enables anyone [...] "to be free so that you can let that primal emotion come out without being embarrassed. Then they polish afterward". Mark Ronson concurred adding that the key is on Mars' charisma, which he has had since he began impersonating Elvis. Ronson concluded, [...] "Everything Bruno adds is what takes it into superstardom".|$|E
60|$|Masouda took a {{key from}} her girdle, and, having {{looked around to}} <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> alone, {{unlocked}} it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Vote! vote! Let us vote!" [...] {{called out}} several new {{students}} loudly, and it <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> urged on by Guy Frapley.|$|R
60|$|The Lemington {{players were}} already on the field, and it <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> rather light in weight, only the full-back being of good size.|$|R
500|$|A {{few days}} later the Emperor awarded Caxias the Order of PedroI and raised him from marquis to duke, the highest rank of Brazilian nobility, and a unique {{distinction}} during PedroII's 58-year reign. The Emperor also appointed him to the Council of State on October 1870. But none of this prevented Caxias from attacks and accusations—some petty—in the parliament, including having left his post without permission. The embittered duke wrote to his friend Manuel Luís Osório, Marquis of Erval: [...] "When I was young, my friend, I {{did not know how}} to explain why the elderly were selfish, but now that I am old, I <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> like that because of the disappointments and ingratitudes they suffer during their lives. At least this is what happens to me".|$|E
2500|$|According to Hauerwas, a “good {{death is}} a death that we can prepare for through living because {{we are able to}} see that death is but a {{necessary}} correlative to a good life." [...] A long life may give a person more of a chance to have a good death because he {{may be able to get}} himself morally in line during that time period, but it is also possible to die well quickly if you have lived morally. A good death also requires that the death be morally in proportion with the way one lived and was sustained, and occurs in a way that allows those caring for us to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> sustaining us.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{contrast}} is between Emile Blondet and Raoul Nathan. Both are multi-talented men-of-letters. Blondet {{is the natural}} son of the prefect of Alençon and is described as witty but lazy, incurably hesitant, non-partisan, a political atheist, a player of the game of political opinions (along with Rastignac), having the most judicious mind of the day. He marries Madame de Montcornet and eventually becomes a prefect. Nathan is described as half-Jewish and possessing a second-rate mind. Nathan succumbs to the flattery of unscrupulous financiers and does not <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> prepared to bankrupt him to achieve their purposes. Blondet sees what is happening but does not enlighten Nathan. The downfall drives Nathan to attempt suicide by the method of [...] "any poor work-girl". He then sells out {{to the government of}} the day (on Blondet's advice) to secure an income, and returns to living with the actress/courtesan Florine. In the end he accepts the cross of the Legion of Honour (which he formerly satirised) and becomes a defender of the doctrine of heredity.|$|E
60|$|Barton would {{perhaps have}} liked {{to ask her to}} let him <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> over, as far as one mortal can do as much for another.|$|R
60|$|<b>Seeing</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> observed, Rais Ali advanced, and, {{with a low}} salaam, {{delivered}} his message to Sidi Omar, who gave him the necessary reply, and dismissed him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I did. And you can <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> perfect ladies; or {{at least}} one of them." [...] Alma laughed at herself, but her mother did not notice.|$|R
2500|$|... “One day Colonel Cody {{sent for}} me to come to his private office. [...] Wondering what he would want of me, I knocked at his door. [...] He invited me in, remarking, ‘Sit down, Standing Bear. [...] I have sent for you because I want you to tell you {{something}} of importance. [...] The Big Chief of this country, the King of England, has promised to attend a performance of our show. [...] Now I want you to go back to your people, call them all together, and tell them all about it. [...] Tell them {{to be very careful about}} their clothes; to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> perfectly clean and neat for that particular performance. [...] If anything needs repairs, tell them to attend to it at once. [...] We must please the King at this performance. [...] Rehearse your Indians well so they will do their best for me. [...] If the King likes our show, it will please the people of this country. [...] I have observed your own costume. [...] It is very fine, and when the King attends the show, I want you to do an Indian dance in front of his box. [...] Will you do this for me?” [...] “Everything worked splendidly. [...] When it came time for the Indians to come in with their village in the center of the arena, we started the dance in which I was to appear before the King of England. [...] I had a beautiful lance, and as the dance proceeded I worked over toward the King’s box. [...] There I shook the lance in his face and danced my very prettiest, you may be sure. [...] The King had been very dignified thus far, and had not even smiled. [...] But when I got down to doing my fancy steps and gave a few Sioux yells, he had to smile in spite of himself. [...] I saw that I had made a hit with him and was very happy. After the show, Buffalo Bill brought the King and his party around the inside of the arena. [...] In front of him walked a big man who seemed to keep his eyes roving about all the while. [...] I think he must have been the King’s personal bodyguard. [...] Buffalo Bill brought the King over to me and we were introduced. [...] We shook hands, although neither of us said a word. [...] But I had the honor of being introduced to King Edward VII, the monarch of Great Britain.” ...|$|E
60|$|What a ludicrous {{difference}} {{do these}} two nobodies make to each other. You can <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> {{to be married}} when he has twopence.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never give up {{your faith}} in the sweet old stones, even after you come to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> only the {{pleasant}} shadow of a lovely truth." ...|$|E
60|$|When the {{horseman}} {{approached it}} <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> driving before them a boy, or lad, on foot. Evidently <b>they</b> <b>were</b> compelling him {{to act as}} their guide.|$|R
6000|$|The {{little man}} shook his head, and {{scratched}} it ruefully as he contemplated this severe indisposition of a principal performer. <b>Seeing</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> at a loss, the child said timidly: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Seeing</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> {{set upon}} it, Cheenbuk handed the pipe to the boy, and bade him draw the smoke in and puff it out, {{taking care not}} to swallow it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Too late, Bella, {{the train}} was in some time ago. Give your orders to me next time. Mother and I'll <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> obeyed," [...] said Edward.|$|E
6000|$|... "At her age?" [...] {{said the}} Doctor. [...] "The idea is startling--almost shocking. Be so good as to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> all drowned. But what else has happened?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> {{well taken}} care of, {{and come back}} {{here to tell you}} where they are," [...] said the cripple, as he started towards the shed.|$|E
60|$|After {{going on}} for about half an hour, Mr. George {{said that he did}} not <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> any nearer {{the top of the hill}} than <b>they</b> <b>were</b> at the beginning.|$|R
5000|$|With a {{terminal}} mouth and being bottom dwelling fish <b>they</b> <b>are</b> known to worms and small crustaceans. [...] However, it has <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> attracted to injured or dead oysters.|$|R
60|$|The dark figures, {{stationary}} on the rocks, {{began to}} move, {{and he could}} <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> coming toward the house. He went indoors, {{so as not to}} appear to have been watching them.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have time}} to wait an hour," [...] Ralph said, turning to Percy; [...] "and {{it will be better}} for our beasts. <b>See</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> rubbed down, and fed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because only {{eighteen}} {{have their}} nails on. If the prisoner of an Iroquois be alive, he begins always by biting his nails off. You <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> missing from four-and-twenty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So that I can clinch them," [...] replied Stuyvesant, [...] "and I {{should like}} to have you take them off the fire {{as soon as you}} <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> red-hot." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{held out}} both {{her hands and}} raised her eyes to mine. Through the filmy lace of her veil I could <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> very soft, almost as though tears were {{gathering}} there.|$|R
60|$|<b>Seeing</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> now understood, Lawrence {{took his}} shot-gun and pistols; the negro also armed himself, {{and in a}} few minutes more they found {{themselves}} paddling gently down the sluggish current of the river.|$|R
60|$|When the Columbus Academy boys {{came out}} on the field, it <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> good, husky fellows, every bit as heavy as the Colby Hall eleven. They looked in the pink of condition.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are right," [...] he said. [...] "Go {{down into}} the dining-room. I am not sure about that fellow Hamel, and Gerald is in a queer temper. Stay with them. <b>See</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{signaled}} to a slave. [...] "Lead the priests to the temple," [...] he commanded, [...] "and ask {{the high priest}} of Tu-lur to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> fed and permitted to return to A-lur when they will." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I say, Ralph," [...] whispered Jack faintly, [...] "do look to my {{wounds and}} <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> all tightly bound up. I can't {{afford to lose}} another drop of blood. It's almost all drained away, I believe." ...|$|E
60|$|Red Sanders and Wison took a {{few steps}} after the Frenchman. Theriere turned once to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> {{following}} him, and then a turn in the trail hid them from his view. Red Sanders stopped.|$|R
6000|$|... "And you, Uiliami," [...] he said, [...] "have {{pointed out}} that the {{soldiers}} have demanded coin and refused the paper Fulualea has offered them. Tell them to take the paper and <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>be</b> paid to-morrow." ...|$|R
60|$|Johnny, much {{affected}} by this conditional renunciation of him, looked down at Moloch's eyes to <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> all right, so far, and skilfully patted her back (which was uppermost), and rocked her with his foot.|$|R
