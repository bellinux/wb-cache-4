5|$|The {{biogeography}} {{demonstrates a}} phylogenetic association, for instance <b>subgenus</b> Hermione having a lowland distribution, but <b>subgenus</b> Narcissus section Apodanthi being montane and restricted to Morocco, Spain and Portugal. The remaining sections within <b>subgenus</b> Narcissus include both lowland and mountain habitats. Section Pseudonarcissus, although widely naturalised is endemic to the Baetic Ranges {{of the south}} eastern Iberian peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Colletid bees of <b>subgenus</b> Cladocerapis {{within the}} genus Leioproctus {{exclusively}} forage on and pollinate flowers of {{many species of}} Persoonia. Bees of <b>subgenus</b> Filiglossa in the same genus also specialise in feeding on Persoonia flowers, but {{do not appear to}} be effective pollinators. The fruit are adapted to be eaten by vertebrates, such as kangaroos and possums, as well as currawongs and other large birds.|$|E
5|$|In {{shells of}} most of the species in the <b>subgenus</b> Amphidromus, resting stages are marked by the {{deposition}} of a brown or black radial band called a varix. This appears to be rare in the <b>subgenus</b> Syndromus, although the shell of A. laevus does show evidence of interruption of the spiral banding after a resting phase.|$|E
5|$|The tansy beetle {{was first}} {{described}} by Linnaeus in 1758 in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae as Chrysomela graminis {{and was later}} transferred to the genus Chrysolina. The genus Chrysolina currently contains 39 subgenera. C. graminis (with its several subspecies) {{is located in the}} <b>subgenus</b> Euchrysolina which contains only one other species – C. virgata; this <b>subgenus</b> was first established in 1950.|$|E
5|$|This swallow, {{along with}} the violet-green swallow and Bahama swallow, {{comprise}} a clade. It is also considered {{to be of the}} <b>subgenus</b> Tachycineta, the nominate <b>subgenus,</b> in addition to the violet-green swallow, Bahama swallow, and tree swallow.|$|E
5|$|While Graham and Barrett (2004) had {{determined}} that <b>subgenus</b> Hermione was monophyletic, Santos-Gally et. al. (2011) did not. If two species excluded {{in the former}} study are removed from the analysis, the studies are in agreement, the species in question instead forming a clade with <b>subgenus</b> Narcissus. Some so-called nothosections have been proposed, to accommodate natural ('ancient') hybrids (nothospecies).|$|E
5|$|Within {{the genus}} Torpedo, the marbled {{electric}} ray belongs to the <b>subgenus</b> Torpedo, which differs from the other <b>subgenus</b> Tetronarce in having fringed margins on their spiracles and generally ornate dorsal coloration. Other common names for this species include common crampfish, marbled torpedo, numbfish, and spotted torpedo.|$|E
5|$|A.abrupta is {{the type}} species of the section Lepidella of the genus Amanita, in the <b>subgenus</b> Lepidella, a {{grouping}} of related Amanita mushrooms characterized by their amyloid spores. Other North American species in this <b>subgenus</b> include A.atkinsoniana, A.chlorinosma, A.cokeri, A.daucipes, A.mutabilis, A.onusta, A.pelioma, A.polypyramis, A.ravenelii, and A.rhopalopus. European and Asian species (also in section Lepidella) that are phylogenetically related—close {{to it in the}} evolutionary family tree—include A.solitaria, A.virgineoides, and A.japonica.|$|E
5|$|Amanita muscaria is {{the type}} species of the genus. By extension, {{it is also the}} type species of Amanita <b>subgenus</b> Amanita, as well as section Amanita within this <b>subgenus.</b> Amanita <b>subgenus</b> Amanita {{includes}} all Amanita with inamyloid spores. Amanita section Amanita includes the species which have very patchy universal veil remnants, including a volva that is reduced to a series of concentric rings and the veil remnants on the cap to a series of patches or warts. Most species in this group also have a bulbous base. Amanita section Amanita consists of A.muscaria and its close relatives, including A.pantherina (the panther cap), A.gemmata, A.farinosa, and A.xanthocephala. Modern fungal taxonomists have classified Amanita muscaria and its allies this way based on gross morphology and spore inamyloidy. Two recent molecular phylogenetic studies have confirmed this classification as natural.|$|E
5|$|Colletid bees of {{the genus}} Leioproctus <b>subgenus</b> Cladocerapis {{exclusively}} forage on and pollinate flowers of many species of Persoonia. Bees of <b>subgenus</b> Filiglossa in the same genus that also specialise in feeding on Persoonia flowers {{do not appear to}} be effective pollinators. Particular species recorded on P.levis include the longtongue bee Leioproctus carinatifrons. Weighing 1700mg (0.60oz), the fruit are adapted to be eaten by vertebrates, such as kangaroos and possums, as well as currawongs and other large birds. The flowers of P.levis are self-incompatible—that is, they are unable to fertilise themselves and require outcrossing to another plant.|$|E
5|$|Colletid bees of {{the genus}} Leioproctus, <b>subgenus</b> Cladocerapis {{exclusively}} forage on and pollinate flowers of many species of Persoonia. Bees of <b>subgenus</b> Filiglossa in the same genus, which also specialise in feeding on Persoonia flowers, {{do not appear to}} be effective pollinators. Weighing 1900mg (0.07oz), the fruit are adapted to be eaten by vertebrates, such as kangaroos, possums and currawongs and other large birds. Seeds have been recorded in the faeces of the brush-tailed rock-wallaby (Petrogale penicillata).|$|E
5|$|Gyromitra caroliniana is {{the type}} species of <b>subgenus</b> Caroliniana of genus Gyromitra. This {{grouping}} comprises species that have, in maturity, coarsely reticulate ascospores (i.e., with a network of ridges on the surface) with multiple blunt spines that originate from the reticulum on the spores. Other species in this <b>subgenus</b> include G.fastigiata and the central European species G.parma. In 1969, Erich Heinz Benedix believed that the spore reticulation was sufficiently unique to be worthy of designation as a separate genus, and he described Fastigiella to contain G.caroliniana. Harri Harmaja disagreed, later placing Fastigiella in synonymy with Gyromitra.|$|E
5|$|Hygrophoropsis was {{originally}} circumscribed in 1888 by German mycologist Joseph Schröter as a <b>subgenus</b> of Cantharellus. It contained a single species, the widespread H.aurantiaca, {{commonly known as}} the false chanterelle. German naturalist Bernhard Studer-Steinhäuslin concluded in 1900 that the fungus was more appropriately placed in the genus Clitocybe, based on its white spores, decurrent gills, and lack of a ring on the stipe. This classification was adopted in the early writings of influential mycologist Rolf Singer, who in 1943 proposed that Hygrophoropsis should be a <b>subgenus</b> of Clitocybe.|$|E
5|$|Smith and Hesler {{classified}} L.argillaceifolius in <b>subgenus</b> Tristes, in stirps Argillaceifolius. This {{grouping of}} related species, which includes L.fumaecolor, {{is characterized by}} the gelatinous cuticle of the stem.|$|E
5|$|The {{specific}} name {{derives from the}} Latin word pilose, meaning 'covered with soft hair'. The ant was first identified in 1858 by British entomologist Frederick Smith in his Catalogue of hymenopterous insects {{in the collection of}} the British Museum part VI, under the binomial name Myrmecia pilosula from specimens he collected in Hobart in Tasmania. There, Smith described the specimens of a worker, queen and male. The type specimen is located in the British Museum in London. In 1922, American entomologist William Morton Wheeler established the <b>subgenus</b> Halmamyrmecia characterised by its jumping behaviour, of which the jack jumper ant was designated as the type species. However, John Clark later synonymised Halmamyrmecia under the <b>subgenus</b> Promyrmecia in 1927 and placed the ant in the <b>subgenus</b> in 1943. William Brown synonymised Promyrmecia due to the lack of morphological evidence that would make it distinct from Myrmecia and later placed the jack jumper ant in the genus in 1953.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Nuttall {{described}} the {{species in the}} second volume of the his 1846 work The North American Sylva with specific epithet aurea ('golden' in Latin). In 1768, Scottish botanist Philip Miller described Ficus maxima, citing Carl Linnaeus' Hortus Cliffortianus (1738) and Hans Sloane's Catalogus plantarum quæ in insula Jamaica (1696). Sloane's illustration of the species, published in 1725, depicted it with figs borne singly, a characteristic of the Ficus <b>subgenus</b> Pharmacosycea. As {{a member of the}} <b>subgenus</b> Urostigma, F. aurea has paired figs. However, a closer examination of Sloane's description led Cornelis Berg to conclude that the illustration depicted a member of the <b>subgenus</b> Urostigma (since it had other diagnostic of that <b>subgenus),</b> almost certainly F. aurea, and that the illustration of singly borne figs was probably artistic license. Berg located the plant collection upon which Sloane's illustration was based and concluded that Miller's F. maxima was, in fact, F. aurea. In his description of F. aurea, which was based on plant material collected in Florida, Thomas Nuttall considered the possibility that his plants belonged to the species that Sloane had described, but {{came to the conclusion that}} it was a new species. Under the rules of botanical nomenclature, the name F. maxima has priority over F. aurea since Miller's description was published in 1768, while Nuttall's description was published in 1846.|$|E
5|$|Tricholoma vernaticum is {{classified}} in the <b>subgenus</b> Contextocutis of the genus Tricholoma on account of its clamp connections and interwoven hyphae in the cap cuticle.|$|E
5|$|Under George's taxonomic {{arrangement}} of Banksia, B.serrata {{is placed in}} the Genus Banksia, <b>Subgenus</b> Banksia, Section Banksia and Series Banksia along with B.aemula, B.ornata, B.baxteri, B.speciosa, B.menziesii, B.candolleana and B.sceptrum.|$|E
5|$|While Graham and Barrett (2004) had {{determined}} that <b>subgenus</b> Hermione was monophyletic, using {{a much larger}} accession Santos-Gally et al. (2011) did not. However the former had excluded species of hybrid origins, while the latter included both N. dubius and N. tortifolius. If these two species are excluded (forming a clade with <b>subgenus</b> Narcissus) then Hermione can be considered monophyletic, although as a section of Hermione, Tazettae is not monophyletic. They also confirmed the monophyly of Apodanthi.|$|E
5|$|With about 750 species, Ficus (Moraceae) {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{angiosperm}} genera (David Frodin of Chelsea Physic Garden ranked it as the 31st largest genus). Ficus aurea is classified in the <b>subgenus</b> Urostigma (the strangler figs) and the section Americana. Recent molecular phylogenies have shown that <b>subgenus</b> Urostigma is polyphyletic, but have strongly supported the validity of section Americana as a discrete group (although its exact relationship to section Galoglychia is unclear).|$|E
5|$|Within {{the genus}} Gymnopilus, {{it is located}} in the <b>subgenus</b> Gymnopilus and section Macrospori. The <b>subgenus</b> Gymnopilus was {{proposed}} by Henri Romagnesi as Cortinatae (while the genus was known as Fulvidula) in 1942, though the name Gymnopilus was given later by Rolf Singer. The <b>subgenus</b> is characterised by mushrooms that feature either no veils, or veils that do not form rings. The section Macrospori, proposed by Guzmán-Dávalos in 1995, is made up of large-spored species with ringless mushrooms. Molecular analysis revealed that G.maritimus forms a sister group to (that is, shares an immediate common ancestor with) the spectabilis–imperialis clade, a clade that includes G.imperialis, G.spectabilis, G.junonius (often considered synonymous with G.spectabilis), G.pampeanus, and others. G. maritimus forms a more inclusive clade along with the members of spectabilis–imperialis; while it produces the smallest fruit bodies, it shares with the other members strong, sturdy mushrooms, caps with fibrils (sometimes with scales) and large, warty spores that turn red in Melzer's reagent or Lugol's iodine.|$|E
5|$|Within the genus, the yellow-tailed {{and the two}} Western Australian white-tailed species, the short-billed and long-billed black cockatoo, {{form the}} <b>subgenus</b> Zanda. The red-tailed and glossy black {{cockatoos}} form the other <b>subgenus,</b> Calyptorhynchus. The two groups are distinguished by differing juvenile food begging calls {{and the degree of}} sexual dimorphism. Males and females of the latter group have markedly different plumage, whereas those of the former have similar plumage.|$|E
5|$|Banksia ilicifolia {{regenerate}}s after bushfire by regrowing from epicormic shoots {{under its}} bark. Follicles open and release seeds after several years. It is weakly serotinous, like eight other Banksia species, {{all of which}} tend to occur in Western Australia's southwestern corner. The other two species of the <b>subgenus</b> Isostylis are killed by fire and regenerate by seed.|$|E
5|$|Chromosome numbers include 2n=14, 22, 26, with {{numerous}} aneuploid and polyploid derivatives. The basic chromosome number is 7, {{with the exception}} of N. tazetta, N. elegans and N. broussonetii in which it is 10 or 11; this <b>subgenus</b> (Hermione) was in fact characterised by this characteristic. Polyploid species include N. papyraceus (4x=22) and N. dubius (6x=50).|$|E
5|$|Hemilepistus reaumuri was {{illustrated}} in volume 21 of the , researched during Napoleon's campaign in Egypt and Syria of 1798–1801, and dedicated to René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur. The section on Crustacea was begun by Marie Jules César Savigny but finished by Jean Victoire Audouin after Savigny's health deteriorated. The species {{was not given}} a formal scientific name, however, until Henri Milne-Edwards did so in 1840, calling it Porcellio reaumuri. Although initially placed in the genus Porcellio, it was later moved by G. H. A. Budde-Lund in 1879 to his new <b>subgenus</b> Hemilepistus, which was raised from a <b>subgenus</b> of Porcellio {{to the rank of}} genus by Karl Wilhelm Verhoeff in 1930. Several species names that were previously thought to be synonyms of H. reaumuri have been re-examined, and found to refer to a species in a different family, now known as Porcellio brevicaudatus.|$|E
5|$|How species {{should be}} defined in a {{particular}} group of organisms gives rise to practical and theoretical problems that {{are referred to as}} the species problem. The scientific work of deciding how to define species has been called microtaxonomy. By extension, macrotaxonomy is the study of groups at higher taxonomic ranks, from <b>subgenus</b> and above only, than species.|$|E
5|$|In a 1978 {{classification}} {{of the genus}} Clavaria, Ronald Petersen placed C.zollingeri in the <b>subgenus</b> Clavaria, a grouping of species with clamp connections absent from all septa in the fruit body; others in the <b>subgenus</b> included C.purpurea, C.fumosa, and the type, C.vermicularis. A large-scale molecular analysis of the phylogenetic distributions and limits of clavarioid fungi in the family Clavariaceae was published by Bryn Dentiger and David McLaughlin in 2006. Based on their analysis of ribosomal DNA sequences, C.zollingeri shared the greatest genetic similarity with Clavulinopsis laeticolor. Petersen's concept of the infrageneric {{classification of}} Clavaria was largely rejected in this analysis, as {{two of the three}} subgenera he proposed were found to be polyphyletic.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius fallax is {{classified}} in the section Plinthogalus of the <b>subgenus</b> Plinthogalus of the genus Lactarius. Species in this section have brown to blackish caps, and a cap cuticle that contains a dissolved brown pigment. The cuticle of most species is of the trichoderm type—where the outermost hyphae emerge roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular to the cap surface.|$|E
5|$|Pygmy sundews: A {{group of}} roughly 40 Australian species, they are {{distinguished}} by miniature growth, {{the formation of}} gemmae for asexual reproduction, and dense formation of hairs in the crown center. These hairs serve to protect the plants from Australia's intense summer sun. Pygmy sundews form the <b>subgenus</b> Bryastrum.|$|E
5|$|Since 1778, this taxon {{has been}} {{recombined}} numerous times into different genera and subgenera. Nearly {{a century after}} Born's description, in 1877, the Swedish naturalist Otto Andreas Lowson Mörch proposed a new combination and transferred this taxon to the genus Cassis and <b>subgenus</b> Semicassis. In 1944, the American malacologist William James Clench recombined the species as Phalium (Semicassis) granulatum, and five years later the Brazilian naturalist Frederico Lange de Morretes recombined it as Semicassis granulatum. American malacologist Clifton S. Weaver reallocated it in the <b>subgenus</b> Tylocassis in 1962, though American malacologist R. Tucker Abbott recombined it as Phalium (Tylocassis) granulatum six years later. American malacologist Andrew C. Miller recombined it as Phalium granulatum in 1983, and German malacologist Kurt Kreipl recombined it as Semicassis (Semicassis) granulata in 1997. The currently accepted combination, Semicassis granulata, was proposed by New Zealand paleontologist Alan Beu, based on paleontological data.|$|E
5|$|Since 1998, American {{botanist}} Austin Mast {{has been}} publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence {{data for the}} subtribe Banksiinae, which includes Banksia. With respect to B.prionotes, Mast's results are fairly {{consistent with those of}} both George and Thiele and Ladiges. Series Crocinae appears to be monophyletic, and B.hookeriana is confirmed as B.prionotes closest relative. Overall, however, the inferred phylogeny is very different from George's arrangement. Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement of Banksiinae by publishing several new names, including <b>subgenus</b> Spathulatae for the species of Banksia that have spoon-shaped cotyledons; in this way they also redefined the autonym B.subgenus Banksia. They have not yet published a full arrangement, but if their nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B.prionotes is placed in <b>subgenus</b> Banksia.|$|E
5|$|The least weasel {{was given}} its {{scientific}} name Mustela nivalis by Carl Linnaeus in his 12th edition of Systema Naturae in 1766. The type locality was Westrobothnia in Sweden. As an animal {{with a very}} wide distribution, the morphology of the least weasel varies geographically. The species was reviewed by Reichstein in 1957 and again by van Zyll de Jong in 1992 and Reig in 1997. Youngman (1982) placed it in the <b>subgenus</b> Mustela while Abramov (1999) considered it {{should be included in}} the <b>subgenus</b> Gale. Based on skull characteristics, Reig (1997) proposed that the taxon should be split into four species, M. subpalmata, M. rixosa, M. vulgaris and M. eskimo. Abrimov and Baryshinikov (2000) disagreed, recognising only M. subpalmata as a separate species.|$|E
5|$|The mouse {{looks like}} Peromyscus, and was once placed as a {{monotypic}} <b>subgenus</b> in the genus Peromyscus The greater size and distinctive coloration of Podomys floridanus {{distinguish it from}} the cotton mouse (Peromyscus gossypinus) and oldfield mouse (Peromyscus polionotus), which also occur in Florida.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} by Louis Secretan in 1833 as Agaricus adustus var. densifolius. In 1876, Claude-Casimir Gillet transferred {{it to the}} genus Russula. Russula densifolia is classified in the section Nigricantes of Russula <b>subgenus</b> Compactae, which consists of species with robust, squat fruit bodies that discolor to brown or black.|$|E
5|$|Tuberous sundews: These nearly 50 Australian species form an {{underground}} tuber {{to survive the}} extremely dry summers of their habitat, re-emerging in the autumn. These so-called tuberous sundews can be further divided into two groups, those that form rosettes and those that form climbing or scrambling stems. Tuberous sundews comprise the <b>subgenus</b> Ergaleium.|$|E
5|$|While Webb {{had simply}} divided the genus into sections, Mathew found this unsatisfactory, {{implying}} every section had equal status. He adapted both Fernandes and Webb {{to devise a}} more hierarchical scheme he believed better reflected the interrelatinships within the genus. Mathew's scheme consists of three subgenera (Narcissus, Hermione and Corbularia). The first two subgenera were then divided into five and two sections respectively. He then further subdivided two of the sections (<b>subgenus</b> Narcissus section Jonqullae, and <b>subgenus</b> Hermione section Hermione) into three subsections each. Finally, he divided section Hermione subsection Hermione further into two series, Hermione and Albiflorae. While lacking a phylogenetic basis, the system is still in use in horticulture. For instance the Pacific Bulb Society uses his numbering system (see Table II) for classifying species.|$|E
