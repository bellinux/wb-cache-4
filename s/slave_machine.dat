40|$|A {{universal}} {{input device}} for interfacing a human operator with a <b>slave</b> <b>machine</b> {{such as a}} robot or the like includes a plurality of serially connected mechanical links extending from a base. A handgrip {{is connected to the}} mechanical links distal from the base such that a human operator may grasp the handgrip and control the position thereof relative to the base through the mechanical links. A plurality of rotary joints is arranged to connect the mechanical links together to provide at least three translational degrees of freedom and at least three rotational degrees of freedom of motion of the handgrip relative to the base. A cable and pulley assembly for each joint is connected to a corresponding motor for transmitting forces from the <b>slave</b> <b>machine</b> to the handgrip to provide kinesthetic feedback to the operator and for producing control signals that may be transmitted from the handgrip to the <b>slave</b> <b>machine.</b> The device gives excellent kinesthetic feedback, high-fidelity force/torque feedback, a kinematically simple structure, mechanically decoupled motion in all six degrees of freedom, and zero backlash.

30|$|MPI, {{which is}} the {{standard}} software communication paradigm used in this network, has been in use {{for several years and}} is well-established and thoroughly debugged. One of the main features of MPI includes the state preserving process i.e., processes can live as long as the system runs and {{there is no need to}} read the same data again and again as in the case of other frameworks such as MapReduce (explained in section “Apache hadoop”). All the parameters can be preserved locally. Hence, unlike MapReduce, MPI is well suited for iterative processing [5]. Another feature of MPI is the hierarchical master/slave paradigm. When MPI is deployed in the master–slave model, the <b>slave</b> <b>machine</b> can become the master for other processes. This can be extremely useful for dynamic resource allocation where the slaves have large amounts of data to process.|$|E

40|$|Design {{of future}} systems for flight-deck {{automation}} will reflect a trend {{of changing the}} paradigm of human-computer interaction from the master (human) - <b>slave</b> (<b>machine)</b> mode to more equilibrated cooperation. In many cases such cooperation considers several humans and computer systems, for which multi-agent dynamic cooperative systems are appropriate models. Development of such systems requires very profound analysis of mutual interactions and conflicts that may arise in such systems. Additional testing is exhaustive and expensive for such systems. In {{the scope of the}} D 3 CoS project these problems are addressed from the modelling point of view with ambition to create tools that will simplify the development phase and replace parts of the testing phase. In this paper we investigate common flight procedures, for which computer assistance could be developed. We show how formal modelling of procedures allows us to inspect procedural inconsistencies and workload peaks before the development starts. We show how a computer cognitive architecture (a virtual pilot) can simulate human pilot behaviour in the cockpit to address questions typical for the early phase of the development. Analysis of these questions allows us {{to reduce the number of}} candidates for the final implementation without the need of expensive experiments with human pilots. This modelling approach is demonstrated on experiments undertaken both with human pilots and a virtual pilot. The quality of the outcome from both experimental settings remains conserved as shown by physiological assessment of pilot workload, which in turn justifies the use of the modelling approach for this type of problems...|$|E

40|$|The {{master-slave}} scheduling {{model is}} a new model recently introduced by Sahni. It has many important applications in parallel computer scheduling and industrial settings such as semiconductor testing, machine scheduling, etc. In this model each job {{is associated with a}} preprocessing task, a slave task and a postprocessing task that must be executed in this order. While the preprocessing and postprocessing tasks are scheduled on the master <b>machine,</b> the <b>slave</b> tasks are scheduled on the <b>slave</b> <b>machines.</b> In this paper we consider scheduling problems on single-master masterslave systems. We first strengthen some previously known complexity results for makespan problems, by showing them to be strongly NP-hard.

30|$|Algorithm 3. Algorithm 3 {{consists}} of two parts. The first part is to transfer a LogDrive database to a Hadoop cluster and to convert it into a SequenceFile. The second half is to create HashDB from the SequenceFile. Although the setup employs 10 GBASE-T Ethernet, the average throughput {{of the first half}} of Algorithm 3 was 28.4 MiB/s and of the second half of Algorithm 3 was 239 MiB/s as shown in Fig.  10, respectively. For example, our setup needs to transfer write logs to a Hadoop cluster at 305 MiB/s when the single virtual machine is executed. The throughput {{of the first half of}} Algorithm 3 could be improved by introducing parallel processing of each part of LogDrive database. The throughput of the second half of Algorithm 3 could be improved by increasing the number of <b>slave</b> <b>machines.</b> For mitigating the low throughput of Algorithm 3, LogDrive has to perform Algorithm 3 periodically in the background.

40|$|Abstract Since the {{complexity}} of virtual experiments (VEs) and their underlying models is constantly increasing, computational performance of monolithic software solutions is rapidly becoming insufficient. Examples of VEs are probabilistic design, model calibration, optimal experimental design and scenario analysis. In order to tackle this computational bottleneck, a framework for the distributed execution of VEs on a potentially heterogeneous pool of work nodes has been implemented. This framework was named WDVE (WEST distributed virtual experimentation) and is built on top of technologies such as Cþþ, XML and SOAP. It was designed for stability, expandability, performance, platform-independence and ease of use. Complex VEs are most often composed of mutually independent sub-experiments, which can be run concurrently. With WDVE, a complex VE that is executed on a so-called Master machine will therefore attempt to execute its sub-experiments on <b>Slave</b> <b>machines</b> that have previously registered with the Master. The process of submitting requests for the execution of sub-experiments is transparent and involves the transfer of {{a description of the}} experiment to be executed, and the resources that are needed for the execution (i. e., model and input data). WDVE is in many ways similar to the Grid Computing paradigm, which is currently receiving widespread attention. However, WDVE is more geared towards application within the scope of water quality management...|$|R

The library defines the engine of the race, that is, the function race. The wrapper file defines all details concerning the specific experiment that must be undertaken.

3000|$|G-SPARQL is a {{declarative}} query language. Thus, for any G-SPARQL query, {{there are}} always various possible execution plans to evaluate such query. G-SPARQL {{is equipped with a}} query optimizer that seeks to optimize the query execution time for any input query. In particular, among a wide space of alternative possible query plans for executing the user input query, the query optimizer employs a cost model to predict the time execution cost of each plan then selects the execution plan that with the minimum cost for actual execution. In order to achieve this goal, the query coordinator node maintains a set of graph statistics (e.g., structural indices, selectivity information of value-based predicates on the attributes of graph nodes and edges) which are utilized by the query optimizer to estimate the time execution cost of each possible query plan. In practice, the query optimizer starts by compiling the user input query (Q) into a logical query plan QP using a defined set of G-SPARQL algebraic operators (Sakr et al. 2012). Using the statistical information and the cost model, the query optimizer compiles the logical query plan (QP) into a set of sub-query physical query execution plans, QP→{RQP_ 1, [...]..., RQP_x, MQP_ 1,..., MQP_y}, where each RQP_i refers to a relational-based sub-query plan which is to be evaluated by one of the relational store on the underlying n slave nodes via SQL queries, x refers to the number of relational-based sub-query plans which is {{less than or equal to}} the number of <b>slave</b> <b>machines</b> (n) and each MQP_j refers to a main memory query plan which is to be evaluated via graph traversal operations.|$|R

30|$|Figure  8 {{illustrates}} the average query execution times on DG-SPARQL for 20 instances {{of each of}} the identified four query types on the DBpedia real dataset. In order to evaluate the speed-up improvement of query execution time in response to increasing the number of slave nodes (partitions), we have repeated this experiment three times using 2, 4 and 6 slave nodes. The results of the experiments show that the percentage of speedup improvement varies from one query type to another. For example, for QT 1, the query plan of this type of queries is translated into a single SQL query which is centrally executed on one of the underlying RDBMS nodes. Therefore, increasing the number of underlying slave nodes does not introduce any speedup improvement for the query execution time of such type of queries. Queries of query type QT 2 achieve the highest percentage of speedup improvement by increasing the number of the underlying slave nodes due to their distributed execution plans over the underlying RDBMS nodes. In particular, increasing the number of slave nodes from 2 to 4 leads to 34  % speedup improvement while increasing the number of slave nodes from 2 to 6 leads to 59  % speedup improvement on the query execution times. Queries of query types QT 3 and QT 4 achieve comparable percentage of speedup improvement by increasing the number of the underlying slave nodes due to due to the network communication overhead and the post processing steps of their query plans. In particular, for QT 3, increasing the number of slave nodes from 2 to 4 leads to 24  % speedup improvement while increasing the number of slave nodes from 2 to 6 leads to 43  % speedup improvement on the query execution times. For QT 4, increasing the number of slave nodes from 2 to 4 leads to 25  % speedup improvement while increasing the number of slave nodes from 2 to 6 leads to 44  % speedup improvement on the query execution times. It should be noted that increasing the number of slave nodes does not necessarily lead to increasing the speedup improvement on the query execution times as the number of relational-based sub-query plans can be less than the number of <b>slave</b> <b>machines.</b> In this case, increasing the number of slave nodes does not lead to speedup improvement on the query execution time for this type of queries. In addition, increasing the number of slave nodes leads to an increase in the overhead of the message exchange between the cluster nodes. This overhead affects having a linear relationship between the number of slave nodes and query execution time.|$|R
