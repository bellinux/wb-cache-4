40|$|We {{extend the}} 3 -point {{intrinsic}} alignment <b>self-calibration</b> <b>technique</b> to the gravitational shear-intrinsic ellipticity-intrinsic ellipticity (GII) bispectrum. The proposed technique {{will allow the}} measurement and removal of the GII intrinsic alignment contamination from the cross-correlation weak lensing signal. While significantly decreased from using cross-correlations instead of auto-correlation in a single photo-z bin, the GII contamination persists in adjacent photo-z bins and must be accounted for and removed from the lensing signal. We relate the GII and galaxy density-intrinsic ellipticity-intrinsic ellipticity (gII) bispectra through use of the galaxy bias, and develop the estimator necessary to isolate the gII bispectrum from observations. We find that the GII <b>self-calibration</b> <b>technique</b> performs at a level {{comparable to that of}} the gravitational shear-gravitational shear-intrinsic ellipticity correlation (GGI) <b>self-calibration</b> <b>technique,</b> with measurement error introduced through the gII estimator generally negligible when compared to minimum survey error. The accuracy {{of the relationship between the}} GII and gII bispectra typically allows the GII self-calibration to reduce the GII contamination by a factor of 10 or more for all adjacent photo-z bin combinations at ℓ> 300. For larger scales, we find that the GII contamination can be reduced by a factor of 3 - 5 or more. The GII <b>self-calibration</b> <b>technique</b> is complementary to the existing GGI <b>self-calibration</b> <b>technique,</b> which together will allow the total intrinsic alignment cross-correlation signal in 3 -point weak lensing to be measured and removed.

40|$|The weak lensing signal (cosmic shear) {{has been}} shown to be {{strongly}} contaminated by the various types of galaxy intrinsic alignment (IA) correlations, which poses a barrier to precision weak lensing measurements. The redshift dependence of the IA signal has been used at the 2 -point level to reduce this contamination by only measuring cross-correlations between large redshift bins, which significantly reduces the galaxy intrinsic ellipticity - intrinsic ellipticity (II) correlation. A <b>self-calibration</b> <b>technique</b> based on the redshift dependences of the IA correlations has also been proposed as a means to remove the 2 -point IA contamination from the lensing signal. We explore here the redshift dependences of the IA and lensing bispectra in order to propose a self-calibration of the IA auto-correlations at the 3 -point level (i. e. GGI, GII, and III), which can be well understood without the assumption of any particular IA model. We find that future weak lensing surveys will be able to measure the distinctive IA redshift dependence over ranges of |Δ z^P|< 0. 2. Using conservative estimates of photo-z accuracy, we describe the 3 -point <b>self-calibration</b> <b>technique</b> for the total IA signal, which can be accomplished through lensing tomography of photo-z bin size ∼ 0. 01. We find that the 3 -point self-calibration can function at the accuracy of the 2 -point technique with modest constraints in redshift separation.

40|$|The {{intrinsic}} alignment (IA) {{of galaxies}} {{has been shown}} to be a significant barrier to precision cosmic shear measurements. (Zhang, 2010, ApJ, 720, 1090) proposed a <b>self-calibration</b> <b>technique</b> for the power spectrum to calculate the induced gravitational shear-galaxy intrinsic ellipticity correlation (GI) in weak lensing surveys with photo-z measurements which is expected to reduce the IA contamination by at least a factor of 10 for currently proposed surveys. We confirm this using an independent analysis and propose an expansion to the <b>self-calibration</b> <b>technique</b> for the bispectrum in order to calculate the dominant IA gravitational shear-gravitational shear-intrinsic ellipticity correlation (GGI) contamination. We first establish an estimator to extract the galaxy density-density-intrinsic ellipticity (ggI) correlation from the galaxy ellipticity-density-density measurement for a photo-z galaxy sample. We then develop a relation between the GGI and ggI bispectra, which allows for the estimation and removal of the GGI correlation from the cosmic shear signal. We explore the performance of these two methods, compare to other possible sources of error, and show that the GGI <b>self-calibration</b> <b>technique</b> can potentially reduce the IA contamination by up to a factor of 5 - 10 for all but a few bin choices, thus reducing the contamination to the percent level. The self-calibration is less accurate for adjacent bins, but still allows for a factor of three reduction in the IA contamination. The self-calibration thus promises to be an efficient technique to isolate both the 2 -point and 3 -point intrinsic alignment signals from weak lensing measurements.

40|$|Photometric {{redshift}} (photo-z) errors, especially catastrophic errors, {{are a major}} uncertainty for precision weak-lensing cosmology. We {{find that}} the shear (galaxy number) density and density-density cross-correlation measurements between photo-z bins, available from the same lensing surveys, contain valuable information for self-calibration of the scattering probabilities between the true redshift and photo-z bins. The <b>self-calibration</b> <b>technique</b> we propose does not rely on cosmological priors nor parameterization of the photo-z probability distribution function, and preserves all of the cosmological information available from shear-shear measurement. We estimate the calibration accuracy through the Fisher matrix formalism. We find that, for advanced lensing surveys such as the planned Stage IV surveys, the rate of photo-z outliers can be determined with statistical uncertainties of 0. 01 - 1 per cent for z < 2 galaxies. Among the several sources of calibration error that we identify and investigate, the galaxy distribution bias is likely the most dominant systematic error, whereby photo-z outliers have different redshift distributions and/or bias than non-outliers from the same bin. This bias affects all photo-z calibration techniques based on correlation measurements. Galaxy bias variations of O(0. 1) produce biases in photo-z outlier rates similar to the statistical errors of our method, so this galaxy distribution bias may bias the reconstructed scatters at several-Sigma level, but is unlikely to completely invalidate the <b>self-calibration</b> <b>technique...</b>|$|E
