50|$|In Distributed Morphology, {{the linear}} order of morphemes is {{determined}} by their hierarchical position in the syntactic structure, {{as well as by}} certain post-syntactic operations. Head movement is the main <b>syntactic</b> <b>operation</b> determining morpheme order, while Morphological Merger (or Merger under Adjacency) is the main post-syntactic operation targeting affix order. Other post-syntactic operations that might affect morpheme order are Lowering and Local Dislocation (see previous section for details on these operations).|$|E
50|$|It is {{frequently}} taken {{to mean that}} every operation of the syntax should be associated with an operation of the semantics that acts on the meanings of the constituents combined by the <b>syntactic</b> <b>operation.</b> As a guideline for constructing semantic theories, this is generally taken, as in the influential work on the philosophy of language by Donald Davidson, to mean that every construct of the syntax should be associated by a clause of the T-schema with an operator in the semantics that specifies how {{the meaning of the}} whole expression is built from constituents combined by the syntactic rule. In some general mathematical theories (especially those in the tradition of Montague grammar), this guideline is taken to mean that the interpretation of a language is essentially given by a homomorphism between an algebra of syntactic representations and an algebra of semantic objects.|$|E

Movement is widely believed to result from a single unitary <b>syntactic</b> <b>operation</b> (Move). We demonstrate common responses in bilateral superior temporal gyri in response to listening to sentences containing unaccusative and transitive verbs compared to unergative verbs and fail to detect any activation that is specific to unaccusatives.

50|$|The {{formative}} list, {{sometimes called}} the lexicon (this term will be avoided here) in Distributed Morphology includes all the bundles of semantic and sometimes syntactic features that can enter the syntactic computation. These are interpretable or uninterpretable features (such as animate, count, etc.) which are manipulated in syntax through the traditional <b>syntactic</b> <b>operations</b> (such as Merge, Move or Agree in the Minimalist framework). These bundles of features {{do not have any}} phonological content; phonological content is assigned to them only at spell-out, that is after all <b>syntactic</b> <b>operations</b> are over. The Formative List in Distributed Morphology differs, thus, from the Lexicon in traditional generative grammar, which includes the lexical items (such as words and morphemes) in a language.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a parser that embodies {{principles of the}} Minimalist Program [Chomsky 1993, 1995] and examines some related computational complexity issues. First, the parser adopts a derivational conception of <b>syntactic</b> <b>operation</b> [Epstein 1995]. Specifically, syntactic relations are completely determined by a derivational structure-building process. Second, it assumes that syntactic operations satisfy featural requirements that are inherent morphological properties of lexical items. Further, the parser uses some economy principles that prefer operations with the "least e#ort". Given these, a notion of "local computation" is realized in the parser that tries to eliminate syntactically illegitimate parses as soon as possible, leading to computational e#ciency. Some psycholinguistic expectations naturally fall out...|$|E

We further show how these shortcomings are avoided by the lexicalist analysis proposed by Hankamer and Mikkelsen (2002) and compare it with an alternative DM analysis that does not rely on head movement in the syntax. We conclude that while a lexicalist or a DM analysis is viable, with interesting trade-offs, neither of the viable analyses involves any movement...|$|E

We argue that this assumption fails already {{in the case of}} so-called 'absolute ' adjectives.

40|$|The term clitics {{applies to}} a class of {{unstressed}} closed class words with distribution unexpected from their syntactic function.

To analyze the vast majority of clitic constructions without phonological movement, we employ remnant movement - a <b>syntactic</b> <b>operation</b> capable of yielding a structure where the phrase has moved up the tree while stranding its complement. Our analysis rests on three points: Clitics are heads of functional projections that carry an EPP feature forcing them to project to the specifier level. ·The EPP feature attracts the closest constituent capable of satisfying it (Shortest Move).
