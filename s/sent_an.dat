The invasion was {{to be carried out}} by four corps, each with its own assigned targets. The Byzantines responded to this threat by concentrating their units at Ajnadyn (a place in Palestine, probably al-Lajjun) from different garrisons. This move tied down the Muslim troops at border regions, as with this large force at their rear, Muslim armies were no longer free to march to central or northern Syria.|$|E

The Achaean army of 20,000 {{infantry}} and 1,000 cavalry advanced on the 5,000-strong Spartan army at Pallantium. Aratus, who had accompanied Aristomachos, advised him to retreat because even 20,000 Achaeans were no match for 5,000 Spartans. Aristomachos, listening to Aratus' advice, retreated with the Achaean army.|$|E

In spring 551, after a long siege and thanks largely to his own perseverance and bravery, the Byzantines and their Sabir allies (some 6,000 troops) captured Petra. A few Persians continued to resist from the citadel, but Bessas ordered it torched. Following his victory, he ordered the city walls razed to the ground.|$|E

Entering the Peloponnese, Flamininus joined his force {{with that of the}} Achaean commander, Aristaenos, who had 10,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry in Cleonae. Together, they advanced towards Argos.|$|E
5|$|Following the First Siege of Constantinople by the Avars and Persians, {{the beleaguered}} Byzantine Emperor Heraclius found himself {{politically}} isolated. He could {{not rely on}} the Christian Armenian potentates of Transcaucasia, since they were branded as heretics by the Orthodox Church, and even the king of Iberia preferred to befriend the religiously tolerant Persians. Against this dismal background, he found a natural ally in Tong Yabghu. Earlier in 568, the Turks under Istämi had turned to Byzantium when their relations with Persia soured over commerce issues. Istämi <b>sent</b> <b>an</b> embassy led by the Sogdian diplomat Maniah directly to Constantinople, which arrived in 568 and offered not only silk {{as a gift to}} Justin II, but also proposed an alliance against Sassanid Persia.

5|$|Immediately {{after that}} campaign, Simeon sought {{to punish the}} Serbian ruler Petar Gojniković who had {{attempted}} to betray him by concluding an alliance with the Byzantines. Simeon <b>sent</b> <b>an</b> army led by two of his commanders, Theodore Sigrica and Marmais, to Serbia. The two managed to persuade Petar to attend a personal meeting, during which he was enchained and carried off to Bulgaria, where he died in a dungeon. Simeon put Pavle Branović, prior to that an exile in Bulgaria, on the Serbian throne, thus restoring the Bulgarian influence in Serbia for a while.|$|E
5|$|In 1333, John de Montecorvino {{was officially}} {{replaced}} by Nicolaus de Bentra, who {{was chosen by}} Pope John XXII. There were complaints {{of the absence of}} the archbishop in 1338.
