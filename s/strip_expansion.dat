40|$|Distance {{sampling}} is {{a technique}} for estimating the abundance of animals or other objects in a region, allowing for imperfect detection. The impact of uncertainty about the detection parameters on the precision of the estimated abundance is important, both for deciding on the appropriate sample size and determining whether to use distance sampling or an alternative method. This paper derives the asymptotic penalty due to this uncertainty, and tabulates it {{for a variety of}} models. The penalty is typically between 2 and 4 but can be much higher, particularly for steeply declining detection rates where distance sampling is typically most strongly recommended. The asymptotic results are confirmed in a simulation study which also examines model-averaging, mis-specified detection function and simple <b>strip</b> <b>expansion.</b> The paper shows that distance sampling needs larger sample sizes than is commonly supposed, and so should not be regarded as the only acceptable approach to abundance estimation...|$|E
40|$|Thc method {{described}} here for recovering lhe {{shape of a}} surface from a shaded image can deal with complex, wrinkled surfaces. Integrability can be enforced easily because bath surface height and gradient are represented. (A gradient field is integrable ir it is thc gradient of süme surface height function.) Thc robustness of the method sterns in part from linearization of the reflectance map about the curren! estimate of thc surfacc orientation at each picturc cell. (Thc reflectance map gives the dependence of scene radiance on surface orienralion.) The new scheme can find an exact solution of a given shape-from-shading problem even though a regularizing term is included. The reason is Ihal the penalty term is needed only to stabilize Ihe iteralive scheme when {{it is far from}} the correet solulion; il can be turned off as the solution is approached. This is arefleetion of the fact that shapefrom-shading problems are not il 1 posed when boundary condilions are available, or when the image contains singular points. This ' article includes a review of previous work on shape from shading and photoclinometry. Novel features ofthe new scheme are introduced one at a time {{to make it easier to}} see what each contributes. Included is a discussion of implementation details that are important if exact algebraic solutions of synlhetic shape-from-shading problems are to be obtained. The hope is that better performance on synthetic data will lead to better ~rformance on real data. I Background The firSI method developed for solving a shape-fromshading problem was restricted to surfuces wilh special reflecting properties (Rindfleisch 1966). For the surfaces that Rindfleisch considered, profiles ofthe solution can be obtained by integrating along predetennined straight Iines in the image. The general problem was formulated and solved later (Horn 1970, 1975), using the mcthod of characteristk <b>strip</b> <b>expansion</b> (Garabedian 1964; John 1978) applied to the nonlinear firstorder partial differential image irradiance equarion. When Ihe light sources and Ihe viewer are far away from the scene being viewed, use of the reflectance map makes the analysis of shape-from-shading algorithm...|$|E
40|$|Bridge {{expansion}} joints, if {{not properly}} designed, constructed, and maintained, {{often lead to}} the deterioration of critical substructure elements. <b>Strip</b> seal <b>expansion</b> joints consisting of a steel extrusion and neoprene gland are one type of expansion joint and are commonly used by the Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT). <b>Strip</b> seal <b>expansion</b> joints are susceptible to tears and pull outs that allow water, chlorides, and debris to infiltrate the joint, and subsequently the bearings below. One area of the strip seal that is particularly problematic is where it terminates at the interface between the deck and the barrier rail. The Iowa DOT has noted that the initial construction quality of the current strip seal termination detail is not satisfactory, nor ideal, and a need exists for re-evaluation and possibly re-design of this detail. Desirable qualities of a strip seal termination detail provide a seal that is simple and fast to construct, facilitate quick gland removal and installation, and provide a reliable, durable barrier to prevent chloride-contaminated water from reaching the substructure. To meet the objectives of this research project, several strip seal termination details were evaluated in the laboratory. Alternate termination details may not only function better than the current Iowa DOT standard, but are also less complicated to construct, facilitating better quality control. However, uncertainties still exist regarding {{the long-term effects of}} using straight-through details, with or without the dogleg, that could not be answered in the laboratory in the short time frame of the research project...|$|R

Their introduction by Faure–Sjöstrand [84] and Tsujii [261] led to rapid progress which included a microlocal proof of Smale’s conjecture about dynamical zeta functions [78], first proved shortly before by Giulietti–Liverani–Pollicott [109]. We review this and other results, again related to upper bounds, resonance free <b>strips</b> and resonances <b>expansions.</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{pilot study}} was {{conducted}} on the premature failures of neoprene <b>strip</b> seals in <b>expansion</b> joints in Iowa bridges. In a relatively large number of bridges, strip seals have pulled out of the steel extrusions or otherwise failed well before the expected life span of the seal. The most serious consequence of a strip seal failure is damage to the bridge substructure due to salt, water, and debris interacting with the substructure. A literature review was performed. Manufacturers 2 ̆ 7 specifications and recommendations, practices in the states bordering Iowa, and Iowa DOT design and installation guidelines were reviewed. Iowa DOT bridge databases were analyzed. A national survey {{was conducted on the}} use and performance of strip seals. With guidance from the Iowa DOT, twelve in-service bridges with <b>strip</b> seal <b>expansion</b> joints were selected for detailed investigation. Effective bridge temperatures and corresponding expansion joint openings were measured, DOT inspection reports were reviewed, and likely cause(s) of premature failures of strip seals were proposed. Experimental results show that for a majority of these serious failures (all in concrete girder bridges), the joint opening at 0 °F predicted by the Iowa DOT design equations, the joint opening at 0 °F extrapolated from the experimental data, or both, are larger than the movement rating of the strip seal specified on the bridge plans. Other likely causes of premature failures of seals in the twelve bridges include debris and ice in the seal cavity, skew of bridge deck, improper installation, and improper setting of the initial gap...|$|R
40|$|The almost {{parabolic}} resistance–temperature characteristic {{shown by}} a thick-film resistor material (Heraeus 8241), printed on an alumina substrate, is {{explained in terms}} of thermal expansion effects in the x, y and z directions between 77 and 535 K. The piezoresistive equation is used to <b>strip</b> the thermal <b>expansion</b> contribution from the almost parabolic resistance–temperature characteristic, leaving a near linear resistance–temperature characteristic. It is suggested that the point of inflection on the resistance–temperature characteristic is primarily due to the non-linear temperature coefficient of expansivity of alumin...|$|R
50|$|Despite having several urban centers, {{these cities}} {{are smaller than}} many more {{well-known}} metropolitan areas across the United States. So while these urban centers have many similar amenities to larger cities, the options and variability can be limited. Due to this, {{there is a very}} high unmet demand for modern urban amenities and entertainment. This unmet demand has led to nearly constant construction and development in areas such as RTP and Charlotte for several decades. These construction projects include planned subdivisions, restaurants, <b>strip</b> malls, highway <b>expansions,</b> new schools, and business parks.|$|R
50|$|The new four-cylinder, {{oversquare}} one-litre water-cooled Opel OHV engine weighed only 96 kg and was {{the first}} all-new engine developed by Opel since before the war. The side-mounted camshaft was driven not through gear-cogs but using a single chain with a hydraulic tensioner, the valve train employing rocker-arms and light-weight hollow rods. The arrangement was low on weight and on friction, permitting engine speeds above 6,000 rpm. The pistons were formed from an aluminium-alloy and incorporated a bimetal <b>expansion</b> <b>strip</b> to ensure uniform thermal expansion. The three-bearing forged crankshaft was of more traditional construction. The carefully designed aluminium inlet manifold provided for efficient feed of the fuel-mixture to the cylinders and helped provide the engine with good fuel economy characteristics.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{implementation}} of a vectorizing C compiler for Intel's MMX (Multimedia Extension). This compiler would identify data parallel sections of the code using scalar and array dependence analysis. To enhance the scope for application of the subword semantics, our compiler performs several code transformations. These include <b>strip</b> mining, scalar <b>expansion,</b> grouping and reduction, loop ssion and distribution. Thereafter inline assembly instructions corresponding to the data parallel sections are generated. We have used the Stanford University Intermediate Format (SUIF), a public domain compiler tool, for our implementation. We evaluated {{the performance of the}} code generated by our compiler for a number of benchmarks. Initial performance results reveal that our compiler generated code produces a reasonable performance improvement (speedup of 2 to 6. 5) over the the code generated without the vectorizing transformations/inline assembly.

40|$|The {{market for}} {{self-monitoring}} of blood glucose (SMBG) approached $ 8. 8 billion worldwide in 2008. Yet despite dramatic double-digit growth in sales of SMBG products since 1980, {{the business is}} now facing declining prices and slower dollar growth. Given that SMBG meters and test strips are viewed by consumers and insurers as essentially generic products, it will be extremely challenging for new market entrants to displace well-entrenched existing competitors without a truly innovative technology. Also, {{in the face of}} declining glucose test <b>strip</b> prices, market <b>expansion</b> can only occur through identification of more of the undiagnosed diabetes population and convincing existing diabetes patients to adopt glucose testing or to test more frequently. Ultimately, a combination of technology innovations, patient education, and economic incentives may be needed to significantly expand the SMBG market and build sustainable long-term dollar growth for SMBG vendors...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we propose an {{algorithm}} {{for the detection of}} edges in images that is based on topological asymptotic analysis. Motivated from the Mumford–Shah functional, we consider a variational functional that penalizes oscillations outside some approximate edge set, which we represent as the union of a finite number of thin strips, the width of which is an order of magnitude smaller than their length. In order to find a near optimal placement of these strips, we compute an asymptotic expansion of the functional with respect to the <b>strip</b> size. This <b>expansion</b> is then employed for defining a (topological) gradient descent like minimization method. As opposed to a recently proposed method by some of the authors, which uses coverings with balls, the usage of strips includes some directional information into the method, which can be used for obtaining finer edges and can also result in a reduction of computation times. 1...|$|R
40|$|We study {{resonances}} of compactly supported potentials V_ε = W (x, x/ε) where W : R^d ×R^d / (2 πZ) ^d →C, d odd. That {{means that}} V_ε is a sum of a slowly varying potential, W_ 0 (x), and one oscillating at frequency 1 /ε. For W_ 0 ≡ 0 we prove {{that there are}} no resonances above the line Imλ = -A (ε^- 1), except possibly a simple resonance of modulus ∼ε^ 2, when d= 1. We show that this result is optimal by constructing a one-dimensional example. In the case when W_ 0 ≠ 0 we prove that resonances in fixed <b>strips</b> admit an <b>expansion</b> in powers of ε. The argument provides a method for computing the coefficients of the expansion. In particular we produce an effective potential converging uniformly to W_ 0 as ε→ 0 and whose resonances approach resonances of V_ε modulo O(ε^ 4). Comment: 65 pages; 3 figures.
