25|$|Walton {{also ordered}} the storm {{door at the}} {{entrance}} to the White House beneath the North Portico removed so that the coffin would pass more easily through the portal. The door was removed, but the frame (embedded in concrete) was not. Black crepe was tacked around the door to cover it. Shriver had the White House driveway lit with small firepots. Kennedy's body arrived at the White House at about 4:30 A.M. The military casket team moved the coffin into the East Room and <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> catafalque. Walton gave General Godfrey McHugh, Kennedy's chief military aide, a spray of flowers to place at the long base of the catafalque.|$|E

500|$|O'Bannon soon {{accepted}} {{an offer to}} work on Alejandro Jodorowsky's adaptation of Dune, a project which took him to Paris for six months. Though the project ultimately fell through, it introduced him to several artists whose work gave him ideas for his science-fiction story including Chris Foss, H. R. Giger, and Jean [...] "Moebius" [...] Giraud. O'Bannon was impressed by Foss's covers for science fiction books, while he found Giger's work [...] "disturbing": [...] "His paintings {{had a profound effect}} on me. I had never seen anything that was quite as horrible and at the same time as beautiful as his work. And so I ended up writing a script about a Giger monster." [...] After the Dune project collapsed, O'Bannon returned to Los Angeles to live with Shusett and the two revived his Memory script. Shusett suggested that O'Bannon use one of his other film ideas, about gremlins infiltrating a B-17 bomber during World War II, and <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spaceship as the second half of the story. The working title of the project was now Star Beast, but O'Bannon disliked this and changed it to Alien after noting the number of times that the word appeared in the script. He and Shusett liked the new title's simplicity and its double meaning as both a noun and an adjective. Shusett came up with the idea that one of the crew members could be implanted with an alien embryo that would burst out of him; he thought this would be an interesting plot device by which the alien could get aboard the ship.|$|E

When the frame was full, the whole made one solid block of type. He then placed it near the fire to warm it. When the paste [...] was {{slightly}} melted, he took a smooth board and pressed it over the surface, so that the block of type became as even as a whetstone.|$|E
2500|$|In 1985, Wyatt {{was joined}} by David Fasold and {{geophysicist}} John Baumgardner for the expedition recounted in Fasold's The Ark of Noah. As soon as Fasold saw the site, he exclaimed {{that it was a}} shipwreck. Fasold brought along state-of-the-art ground-penetrating radar equipment and a [...] "frequency generator", <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wavelength for iron, and searched the formation for internal iron [...] (the latter technique was later compared to dowsing by the site's detractors). Fasold and the team states that the ground penetration radar revealed a regular internal structure and measured the length of the formation as , close to the 300 cubits (157m, 515ft) of the Noah's Ark in the Bible if the Ancient Egyptian cubit of 20.6 inches (0.52m) is used. Fasold believed the team found the fossilized remains of the upper deck and that the original reed substructure had disappeared. In the nearby village of Kazan (formerly Arzap), they examined so-called drogue (anchor) stones that they believed were once attached to the ark.|$|E

Others think that, by being a decisive step in establishing the Jewish Agency's position as the sole leader of the Yishuv, the Saison made possible the establishment of the State of Israel without a violent sectarian struggle. It has also been seen as a [...] "minor civil war" [...] which vaccinated the Israeli society.|$|R

5000|$|In the 1984 Orange Bowl game, #1 ranked Nebraska trailed Miami 17-0 {{after the}} first quarter. Early in the second quarter, Nebraska coach Tom Osborne called for the play, whereby Nebraska quarterback Turner Gill {{effectively}} [...] "fumbled" [...] the snap from center Mark Traynowicz, by <b>setting</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> turf. The ball {{was picked up by}} offensive guard Dean Steinkuhler, who ran the ball 19 yards for a touchdown. This {{was not the first time}} that Nebraska ran it, having first tried it twice in a 17-14 loss to Oklahoma in 1979. Reflecting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> game years later, Miami coach Howard Schnellenberger denounced the use of the play: We had to come up with some good plays at the end there to win it, but we did force them to resort to the fucking fumblerooski. I told them before the game if those bastards have to run the fumblerooski, come to the sidelines and party because they have given up their right of manhood.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{restoration}} {{of democracy in}} Myanmar {{is one of the}} most important developments in the country's history and potentially of large significance for the region. Owing to its strategic position, Myanmar connects Asia's three big markets - Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), China, and India. Since 2011, Myanmar has embarked on a path of political and economic reforms, paving the way for unlocking the country's large potential. Myanmar's underdeveloped infrastructure, unavailability and mismatching of skilled human resources and poor connectivity with neighbouring countries seriously limit Myanmar's participation in the regional and global economies. This non-technical paper discusses Myanmar's participation in regional integration initiatives and argues that greater integration with the neighbours would be of paramount importance in building the country's infrastructure and <b>setting</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> faster growth path...|$|R
