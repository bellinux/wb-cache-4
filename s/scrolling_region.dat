50|$|The Vertical <b>scrolling</b> <b>region</b> {{is defined}} by setting the VS bit ($20) on a {{sequential}} series of ANTIC Mode Lines in the Display List. The first Mode line without the VS bit set becomes {{the end of the}} <b>scrolling</b> <b>region</b> and is used as a buffer line to supply the new information to scroll up {{into the bottom of the}} <b>scrolling</b> <b>region.</b>|$|E
50|$|Vertical fine {{scrolling}} {{moves the}} <b>scrolling</b> <b>region</b> {{the number of}} scan lines in a single Mode line of the <b>scrolling</b> <b>region,</b> up {{to a maximum of}} 16 scan lines. See VSCROL.|$|E
50|$|Fine {{scrolling}} requires setup {{to define}} the <b>scrolling</b> <b>region.</b> This is done by setting the Vertical Scroll (VS) modifier bit in sequential Display List instructions. The first Mode line instruction without the VS bit set becomes {{the end of the}} <b>scrolling</b> <b>region</b> and is used as a buffer line to supply the new scan lines to scroll up {{into the bottom of the}} <b>scrolling</b> <b>region.</b>|$|E

50|$|To animate or <b>scroll</b> new <b>regions</b> of an {{extended}} Wave into view simply click on {{the left or right}} hand side of the screen (lower half), whereupon the entire network of Items on that Wave will animate smoothly in the indicated direction.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the idea of}} Prandtl's {{boundary}} layer is exported to a field other than fluid dynamics. Excitable media, such as nerve fibers and heart tissue are typically modelled with a reaction-diffusion equations containing two chemical species that evolve on very different time scales. In three dimensions solutions of these equations {{take the form of}} rotating scroll waves (interfaces) ending on filaments. The ratio of the two time scales defines a natural small parameter epsilon. Exploiting the inherent smallness of epsilon, singular perturbation methods are used to derive three-dimensional equations for each of the two boundary layers : interface <b>region</b> (<b>scroll)</b> and filament <b>region</b> (core), and for the associated outer <b>region.</b> For <b>scrolls</b> with uniform twist about straight filaments, this matched asymptotic expansion method is also used to derive free-boundary equations not only at leading order but also at first order. Both orders are validated against full solutions of the reaction-diffusion equations. Using these two orders and with no adjustable parameters, the shape and frequency of waves are correctly predicted for most cases of physical interest...|$|R
50|$|The Vertical <b>scrolling</b> <b>region</b> in {{a display}} is defined by setting the VS bit ($20) on a {{sequential}} series of ANTIC Mode Lines in the Display List. The first Mode line without the VS bit set becomes {{the end of the}} <b>scrolling</b> <b>region</b> and is used as a buffer line to supply the new information to scroll up {{into the bottom of the}} <b>scrolling</b> <b>region.</b>|$|E
50|$|Since fine {{scrolling}} {{is based}} on scan lines not pixel height, and <b>scrolling</b> <b>region</b> movement is done simply by skipping scan lines from the first Mode line and adding scan lines to the last Mode line, {{it is possible to}} use different graphics Modes within the <b>scrolling</b> <b>region.</b> This merely requires additional care when determining how many scan lines can be shifted for the current first and last Mode lines in the <b>scrolling</b> <b>region.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Instead {{of using}} an LMS {{modifier}} for every line this method uses a more [...] "normal" [...] display list that only requires one LMS modifier {{at the start}} of the <b>scrolling</b> <b>region.</b> An increment (+1) to the LMS modifier address makes the <b>scrolling</b> <b>region</b> appear to move toward the left. However, the [...] "new" [...] information that has moved into the right side of the <b>scrolling</b> <b>region</b> was previously the first byte on the following line (except for the last byte of the last line — that information had been completely off screen).|$|E
50|$|The ANTIC chip {{used by the}} Atari 8-bit family {{includes}} display list interrupts (DLIs), {{which are}} triggered as the display is being drawn. The ANTIC chip itself is considerably powerful and inherently capable of many features which other systems require raster interrupts to duplicate. ANTIC can mix multiple graphics modes on the screen, display horizontal and vertical overscan graphics, and fine <b>scroll</b> selected horizontal <b>regions.</b> DLIs on the Atari are typically used to add additional color to the display and reuse Player/Missile graphics elements.|$|R
40|$|An optical test-bench is {{described}} that emulates {{the effects of}} propagating monochromatic light through atmospheric turbulence. Unperturbed planar wavefronts, when imaged through an optical system, define a diffraction limited point spread function (PSF). Phase perturbations are introduced using a liquid crystal spatial light modulator (LC-SLM). The LC-SLM is programmed with a dynamic phase screen to generate a spatially variable PSF. A microcontroller is used to <b>scroll</b> a windowed <b>region</b> of the LC-SLM, generating spatio-temporal phase perturbations from one or more point sources. A novel method is proposed to measure phase modulation using wavefront tilt. The optical testbench is proposed {{for the study of}} inverse problems, such as atmospheric tomography and deconvolution from wavefront sensing...|$|R
40|$|To {{increase}} the heating capacity of air-source heat-pump in cold regions, an improved heat pump cycle with scroll compressor economizer was developed. The measured {{results of the}} prototype demonstrate that it can provide a high temperature and high-capacity water supply even under a low ambient temperature of - 10 ~- 15 Â Â°C. The performances of the improved heat-pump cycle are comprehensively analyzed with aid of the proposed thermodynamic model in this paper. The design parameters and {{the components of the}} cycle are optimized and the predicted results. The predicted results discussed indicate that the improved heat pump has high efficiency under all weather conditions and that this improvement is conducive to enlarging the running region of the heat pump and providing an alternative heating service for cold regions.

50|$|Blank Mode lines {{cannot be}} {{contained}} within a <b>scrolling</b> <b>region,</b> because Blank Mode line instructions inherently {{do not have}} Fine Scrolling Modifier bits. However, a Blank Mode instruction {{can be used to}} end a vertical <b>scrolling</b> <b>region</b> and is still subject to the expected scan line height changes per the vertical scroll value.|$|E
50|$|ANTIC's {{process of}} {{vertical}} fine scrolling works by simply directing ANTIC to skip {{a number of}} scan lines for the first mode line of the <b>scrolling</b> <b>region.</b> Subsequent Mode lines in the <b>scrolling</b> <b>region</b> are not affected. The last line of the region supplies the bottom border of the <b>scrolling</b> <b>region</b> displaying the number of scan lines that {{were removed from the}} first line. This number of scan lines is controlled with the VSCROL register. The value ranges from 0 to the ANTIC Mode line's scan line height - 1. The maximum value range covers fine scrolling 16 scan lines from 0 to 15.|$|E
50|$|Horizontal fine {{scrolling}} {{moves the}} <b>scrolling</b> <b>region</b> up to 16 color clocks. See HSCROL.|$|E
50|$|Fine {{scrolling}} requires setup {{to define}} the horizontal <b>scrolling</b> <b>region.</b> The {{first step is to}} start with a Display List using the LMS instruction modifier to specify starting address of each Mode line. This is done to organize screen memory as long rows of data for the display. The next step is setting the Horizontal Scroll (HS) modifier bit in all Display List Mode line instructions for the <b>scrolling</b> <b>region.</b>|$|E
50|$|When {{the fine}} {{scrolling}} limit is reached, scrolling continues by resetting the VSCROL value and performing a coarse vertical scroll of the <b>scrolling</b> <b>region.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Blank Mode lines {{cannot be}} {{contained}} within a <b>scrolling</b> <b>region,</b> because Blank Mode line instructions inherently {{do not have}} a Vertical Scroll Modifier bit. (Blank Mode line instructions specify the blank line count using the bits 7 through 5 that function as LMS, HS, and VS Modifiers for [...] "regular" [...] Playfield Mode instructions.) However, a Blank Mode instruction can be used to end a <b>scrolling</b> <b>region</b> and is still subject to the expected scan line height changes per the vertical scroll value.|$|E
50|$|Horizontal coarse {{scrolling}} {{requires a}} little more effort than vertical scrolling. While horizontal scrolling is expected to present {{the illusion of a}} view port moving left and right across a wide panoramic scene made of screen memory, ANTIC's automatic memory scan increment conflicts with this idea that the rows of screen data is wider than the display. Presenting screen memory as long horizontal lines requires an LMS modifier for every Display List Text or Map Mode instruction in the <b>scrolling</b> <b>region.</b> A horizontal step is accomplished by incrementing or decrementing all the LMS addresses of the <b>scrolling</b> <b>region.</b>|$|E
50|$|Example: Given {{an eight}} scan line ANTIC Mode (Text Modes 2, 4, or 6) with the VS bit set on two {{adjacent}} Mode lines the <b>scrolling</b> <b>region</b> then {{consists of three}} Mode lines—the third line in the <b>scrolling</b> <b>region</b> is the first Mode line encountered without the VS bit set. When Vertical scrolling is not set in the Display List the three Modes lines would naturally result in 24 displayed scan lines. When the VS bits are set in the Display List Mode instructions as described and the VSCROL value is set to 2 then the first Mode line in the region begins displaying at scan line 2 showing scan lines 2 to 7 (six scan lines or 8 - VSCROL), the second Mode line is displayed completely (eight scan lines), and the final Mode line ends at scan line 2 showing scan lines 0 to 2 (three scan lines or VSCROL + 1). The total scan lines displayed in the <b>scrolling</b> <b>region</b> is then 6 + 8 + 3 = 17 scan lines.|$|E
50|$|One other {{limit to}} be aware of is that the two byte LMS {{modifier}} address must not be updated when ANTIC is processing the LMS. If ANTIC reads the LMS address while it is partially updated ANTIC will display the incorrect section of memory for that Mode line. When the <b>scrolling</b> <b>region</b> of a display requires multiple LMS address updates the possibility of a partial update increases, and the possibility of having two subsequent lines display the same data also increases. Programs solve this in a number of ways—performing updates during the Vertical blank, monitoring the VCOUNT before updates, or doing the updates in Display List Interrupts executed during sections of the display away from the <b>scrolling</b> <b>region.</b>|$|E
50|$|When {{the fine}} {{scrolling}} limit is reached, continue scrolling by resetting the HSCROL value and performing a coarse horizontal scroll of the <b>scrolling</b> <b>region.</b> Note that ANTIC's 16 color clock range permits fine scrolling multiple Text Mode characters {{or more than}} one byte worth of Map mode pixels. Therefore, the update to the LMS addresses may add or subtract multiple bytes.|$|E
5000|$|Vertical Fine Scrolling allows single {{scan line}} {{movement}} of the <b>scrolling</b> <b>region</b> for Text and Map modes which are greater than one scan line tall. Vertical Fine Scrolling for Map modes only one scan line tall is logically not practical. The effect of vertical [...] "fine" [...] scrolling for single scan line Map modes can be performed using the easier coarse scrolling method.|$|E
50|$|Further {{enhancement}} {{of this concept}} uses the LMS modifier option on every line that does scroll. Vertical scrolling on this display requires updating one LMS modifier address for each Mode line in the <b>scrolling</b> <b>region.</b> When the display is managed at this level of detail ANTIC's 4K screen RAM boundary can be easily circumvented. Even in this worst case example the CPU effort expended is {{a tiny fraction of}} the processing needed to bulk move screen data.|$|E
50|$|Horizontal Fine Scrolling allows {{single color}} clock {{movement}} of the <b>scrolling</b> <b>region</b> for Text and Map modes. Note that for all normal color interpretations this is by color clock, not pixel even when pixels are larger (or smaller) than the color clocks. ANTIC Modes using the alternate GTIA color interpretations must be scrolled by an entire GTIA pixel (two color clocks). Only even values {{should be used to}} ensure correct GTIA pixel scrolling. Odd values of HSCROL will shift the GTIA pixel stream into a different state that will be interpreted as different colors.|$|E
50|$|An {{interesting}} use of ANTIC's DMA memory scan behavior {{permits a}} strategy for apparently long horizontal scrolling distances, but uses {{a fraction of the}} real memory required. As discussed in Horizontal Coarse Scrolling ANTIC's automatic memory scan increment from Mode line to Mode line conflicts with the idea that the rows of screen data are wider than the display. Using memory actually organized as a long, horizontal, contiguous series of bytes requires an LMS modifier for every Display List Text or Map Mode instruction in the <b>scrolling</b> <b>region.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{second half}} of this {{strategy}} requires the last byte/character of every line in the <b>scrolling</b> <b>region</b> to be updated to show the desired, new information. For a typical scrolling display this would mean updating the last byte {{of one or two}} dozen lines which takes a trivial amount of time in assembly. So, if this scrolling process involves a full screen Mode 2 or Mode 4 text display (rather worst case) and uses the entire 4K capability of ANTIC's automatic screen memory addressing, then the horizontal scrolling can continue in this manner for about 3,000 steps; equivalent to 75 full screens.|$|E
50|$|Vertical Scrolling would ordinarily not be {{considered}} useful for ANTIC Mode F which is one scan line tall. However, if Vertical Scrolling is enabled for the Mode F Display List instruction, and the VSCROL register is set to 13, then ANTIC's line counter will count from 13 to 0 (four scan lines—13, 14, 15, 0). In doing so ANTIC outputs the same line of graphics for each scan line from its internal buffer without re-reading the same screen memory again. The end of the vertical <b>scrolling</b> <b>region</b> needs to have VSCROL reset to 3 allowing ANTIC to count from 0 to 3 (four scan lines). The end result is a Mode F display where the lines are four scan lines tall rather than one, but with the DMA overhead of only one screen memory data read occurring on the first scan line.|$|E
