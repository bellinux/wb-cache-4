40|$|Abstract — A {{technique}} to build mm-wave arbitrary 2 N band oscillators is presented. Based on even-odd mode operation, the technique breaks the fundamental tradeoff between frequency <b>switching</b> <b>range</b> and tank quality factor, Q, which exists in classical switched-capacitor and switched-inductor methods. As a result, this technique achieves multi-band operation with FOMs comparable to single band oscillators. To verify the theory, a quadruple band oscillator with 4 arbitrary chosen frequencies (43, 49, 58 and 75 GHz) is implemented in 65 -nm CMOS technology.

40|$|Fifth {{generation}} (5 G) wireless {{system is}} expected to enable new device-to-device (D 2 D) and machine-to-machine (M 2 M) applications that will impact both consumers and industry. Moreover, for efficient M 2 M communication, both one dimensional (1 -D) and two dimensional (2 -D) beam switching is highly needed for high data-rate wireless radio links. A planar array with 2 -D beam switching capabilities is highly desirable in 5 G system. This thesis proposes a new technique of achieving simple and cost effective 2 -D beam switching array antenna at 28 GHz for 5 G wireless system. The technique involves lateral cascading of Butler matrix (BM) beamforming network (BFN). However, designing a planar BM at 28 GHz that will allow K-connector is not a trivial issue because the distances between the ports are X/ 4 electrical length apart. Nevertheless, two branch line coupler (BLC) with unequal ports separation at 28 GHz on a single substrate are designed and applied to design 1 -D switched beam antennas based on BLC and 4 * 4 BM. Then two of these antennas are laterally cascaded to achieve 2 -D beam switching antenna. This novel concept {{is the basis for}} choosing BM BFN in the design. The proposed 1 -D array antennas on BLC and BM have wide measured impedance bandwidth of 18. 9 % (5. 3 GHz) and 21. 7 % (6. 1 GHz) and highest gain of 14. 6 dBi and 15. 9 dBi, respectively. The 2 -D switched beam antenna on cascaded BLC has highest realized gain of 14. 9 dB, radiation efficiency of 86 %, 86. 8 %, 85. 5 %, and 83. 4 % at ports 1 to 4, respectively.

40|$|In this thesis, two topologies from a Zero voltage {{switching}} {{family are}} compared {{in terms of}} the power losses and weight of the magnetic components. These prerequisites are dictated by the purpose of the application - an offshore converter platform for an HVDC line. Two candidates were chosen: a Single active bridge dc/dc converter and a Dual active bridge dc/dc converter. The both topologies are implemented in Simulink at 2 different operating frequencies: 2 kHz and 10 kHz. The power rating of the application is 2. 7 MW. The input and the output voltages are 3. 6 kV and 40 kV respectively. Because {{of the fact that the}} specificity of the application does not imply a constant power supply the converters are tested in terms that they should remain in the lossless <b>switching</b> <b>range</b> even when the input power is reduced. • The both converters have very high efficiency. The simulations have shown, that the DAB topology does not have any switching losses at all, neither in the transistors nor in the diodes. The primary side of the SAB topology operates without any switching losses in the transistors as well, though pretty high reverse recovery losses were observed in the rectifying stage.

The EC windows were controlled by a variety of means to bring in daylight while minimizing window glare. For some cases, a Venetian blind was coupled with the EC window to block direct sun. Some tests also involved dividing the EC window wall into zones where the upper EC zone was controlled to admit daylight while the lower zone was controlled to prevent glare yet permit view. If visual comfort requirements are addressed by EC control and Venetian blinds, a 2 -zone EC window configuration provided average daily lighting energy savings of 10 {+-} 15 % compared to the reference case with fully lowered Venetian blinds. Cooling load reductions were 0 {+-} 3 %. If the reference case assumes no daylighting controls, lighting energy savings would be 44 {+-} 11 %.

Peak demand reductions in lighting energy use were 0 % or 72 - 100 % compared to a reference case with and without daylighting controls, respectively.

40|$|Flow between {{concentric}} {{spheres of}} radius ratio η = r_i/r_o = 0. 35 is studied in a 3 m outer diameter experiment. We have measured the torques {{required to maintain}} constant boundary speeds as well as localized wall shear stress, velocity, and pressure. At low Ekman number E = 2. 1 × 10 ^- 7 and modest Rossby number 0. 07 < Ro < 3. 4, the resulting flow is highly turbulent, with a Reynolds number (Re=Ro/E) exceeding fifteen million. Several turbulent flow regimes are evident as Ro is varied for fixed E. We focus our attention on one flow transition in particular, between Ro = 1. 8 and Ro = 2. 6, where the flow shows bistable behavior. For Ro within this range, the flow undergoes intermittent transitions between the states observed alone at adjacent Ro outside the <b>switching</b> <b>range.</b> The two states are clearly distinguished in all measured flow quantities, including a striking reduction in torque demanded from the inner sphere by the state lying at higher Ro. The reduced angular momentum transport appears {{to be associated with}} the development of a fast zonal circulation near the experiment core. The lower torque state exhibits waves, one of which is similar to an inertial mode known for a full sphere, and another which appears to be a strongly advected Rossby-type wave.

Turbulent multiple stability and the resilience of transport barriers associated with zonal flows are important topics in geophysical and astrophysical contexts...|$|E

The SAR antenna <b>switches</b> the <b>range</b> beam to point at each of the sub-swaths in turn, transmits pulses and receives echoes pulse by pulse. The design method of main system parameters and the calculating expressions of the performance indexes are addressed in the paper. A design example is given to compare the performance of the conventional strip operation, ScanSAR and FA-ScanSAR operation. The results show that FA-ScanSAR operation can obtain high resolution by full aperture accumulation in wide swath and improve the signal-to-noise ratio of SAR images for the nearspace slow-moving platform borne SAR. 1...|$|R
