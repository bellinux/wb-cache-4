25|$|Besides {{the ghost}} boy, {{there have been}} other ghosts {{described}} by Weird NJ readers. One claims to have seen a ghost Camaro driven by a girl who supposedly died when she crashed it in 1988 (any mention while driving the road at night is supposed to trigger a manifestation). Another claims to have encountered two park rangers one night while camping with friends near Terrace Pond, a glacial tarn on a ridge accessible from the road by hiking trails, who in the morning turned out to have been the ghosts of two rangers who had died on the job in 1939. Other Weird NJ readers claim to have <b>seen</b> <b>people</b> dressed weirdly at odd hours who simply stare at those who see them and do not speak, who either disappear or are not seen by others present.|$|E

500|$|Compared {{to other}} Soviet officials, Kosygin stood {{out as a}} pragmatic and {{relatively}} independent leader. In a description given by an anonymous high-ranking GRU official, Kosygin is described as [...] "a lonely and somewhat tragic figure" [...] who [...] "understood our faults and shortcomings of our situation in general and those in our Middle East policy in particular, but, being a highly restrained man, he preferred to be cautious." [...] An anonymous old co-worker of Kosygin said [...] "He always had an opinion of his own, and defended it. He was a very alert man, and performed brilliantly during negotiations. He was able to cope quickly with the material that was totally new to him. I have never <b>seen</b> <b>people</b> of that calibre afterwards." ...|$|E

At Eurogamer, Wesley Yin-Poole labelled Mika as SFVs [...] "most hated character", writing [...] "I've <b>seen</b> <b>people</b> criticise R. Mika players for doing nothing but going for this Passion Rope Throw over and over again until it lands. Some within the fighting game community believe this move, as well as the [...] "vortex" [...] style, is not a [...] "high skill" [...] strategy", and as a result Mika has been labelled [...] "cheap" [...] and a [...] "troll character" [...] that is frustrating to play against.|$|E
500|$|On July 10, the Rose–Baley Party reached Zuni Pueblo, which {{according}} to Baley was then home {{to as many as}} two thousand agricultural Native Americans. They spent several hours visiting and sightseeing, and the Zuni sold them cornmeal and vegetables, as this was the last such opportunity to purchase supplies until San Bernardino, approximately [...] away. According to Baley, this is most likely the first time the Zuni had encountered European women and children, and the first time the emigrants had ever <b>seen</b> <b>people</b> with albinism, which, although rare, was noticeably present in the Zuni population. They left Zuni Pueblo late that afternoon and entered unfamiliar territory that, until now, had only been traversed by Native Americans, explorers, mountain men, and Spanish missionaries. In Baley's opinion, the Rose–Baley Party had previously enjoyed the benefits of a primitive but well-established trail; however, at this point they became the first emigrant wagon train to venture onto the untested Beale's Wagon Road.|$|E

500|$|Astronaut Buzz Aldrin {{called the}} visual effects [...] "remarkable", and said, [...] "I was so extravagantly {{impressed}} by the portrayal {{of the reality of}} zero gravity. Going through the space station was done just the way that I've <b>seen</b> <b>people</b> do it in reality. The spinning is going to happen—maybe not quite that vigorous—but certainly we've been fortunate that people haven't been in those situations yet. I think it reminds us that there really are hazards in the space business, especially in activities outside the spacecraft." [...] Former NASA astronaut Garrett Reisman said, [...] "The pace and story was definitely engaging and I think it was the best use of the 3-D IMAX medium to date. Rather than using the medium as a gimmick, Gravity uses it to depict a real environment that is completely alien to most people. But the question that most people want me to answer is, how realistic was it? The very fact that the question is being asked so earnestly {{is a testament to the}} verisimilitude of the movie. When a bad science fiction movie comes out, no one bothers to ask me if it reminded me of the real thing." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{attending}} USC School of Cinematic Arts {{and working}} at a youth center in South Los Angeles, Atchison incorporated his experiences from the neighborhood into the film; among them, he heard that children who {{do well in school}} are said to be [...] "acting white". As a result, Atchison tried to use the film to show what causes these children to doubt their own abilities. This doubts are shown through the preconceptions Akeelah and other community members have that [...] "Spelling Bee is for someone else". She [...] "must first overcome her feelings of inadequacy," [...] and when she discovers Larabee comes from her neighborhood and is a successful man, it [...] "empowers her to ... accomplish this task." [...] Fishburne stated the film's treatment of race extends beyond the dichotomy of struggle and success, and goes into the prejudice that many people hold against black people competing in mainstream society. Atchison elaborated, [...] "it's about this girl's insecurity about doing a thing that she hasn't <b>seen</b> <b>people</b> who look like her doing". The director affirmed that African American children in film usually aspire to nothing other than being successful in sports, music or dance. He argued that the film industry has disseminated [...] "lies about black inferiority", so he was interested in focusing in their intellect rather than let them succumb to the stereotypes. Atchison noted he had created the project for all publics [...] "but particularly for kids of color to see a little black girl who does something powerful." ...|$|E
500|$|Lamb {{described}} the incident for Dolan in far more detail. He {{said that on}} 25 June he had finished his woodworking job at 15:00, refused to work overtime (having put in 62 hours that week), then drunk six beers at home during the afternoon and gone to sleep at 21:00. He woke up soon after, he said, and loaded his uncle's shotgun, intending to kill himself. [...] "Next thing I knew," [...] he continued, [...] "I was on the street." [...] He told Dolan that he had <b>seen</b> <b>people</b> [...] "as {{if they were on}} television". He heard the sound of a gun being fired as if it were coming from far away, and remembered a voice that was not his own saying [...] "Put up your hands". He then remembered hearing the dim, far-off gun again, a vision of a terrified man standing before him, then yet another shot. He told Dolan he remembered crossing the street, seeing a girl's outline in a doorway and [...] "somehow" [...] shooting at her. Lamb then said he had fired at a passing car, and that [...] "everything seemed unreal." [...] He said that the next thing he had memory of was confronting an elderly lady at a house nearby, suddenly thinking [...] "what the hell am I in here for" [...] and leaving. He concluded his account by saying that he had hailed a cab from the corner of Pillette and Tecumseh Road and gone back to his uncle's house.|$|E

500|$|The Hendrix {{defense team}} did not dispute that the drugs {{were found in}} his bag. They instead {{developed}} a strategy intended to demonstrate {{that he was not}} aware of its contents. Further, they offered substantiated accounts of how common it was for him to receive gifts from fans, which often included drugs. Hendrix was called as the first witness for the defense; he testified that fans showered gifts on him, including teddy bears, scarves, clothing, and jewelry. He explained that while in Beverly Hills, California, a female fan had given him a vial of what he thought was Bromo-Seltzer—a legal medication—which he put in his bag without knowledge of the illegal substances contained therein. Malone countered: [...] "You are charged with a serious offense, and your evidence is you don't really know how it got there, or who put it there", to which Hendrix responded: [...] "Yes." [...] The prosecutor then held up the aluminum tube in which the hashish was found and asked Hendrix to explain what he thought it was, he replied: [...] "A pea shooter", drawing uproarious laughter from the court. When asked about his drug use, he denied that he had ever used heroin or amphetamines, but admitted to smoking cannabis and hashish. He also admitted that he had used cocaine twice and LSD five times. He testified that his cannabis use had declined over the previous year, stating: [...] "I feel I have outgrown it". Hendrix admitted that he had <b>seen</b> <b>people</b> use heroin, but denied any further knowledge of the drug. He testified that he was given some gifts at a fan club meeting for the Beatles that were intended for the English group; when he opened them he found several joints as well as what appeared to be doses of LSD.|$|E

I am not saying that I know that these musicians are going to mess their lives up, but I have seen it happen to some people and it frightens me very much." [...] Mageroy, however, defends the unblack metal bands' intentions: [...] "A lot of Christian bands have done amazing things being led by God.
