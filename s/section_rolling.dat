40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to examine}} the feasibility of a new concept in <b>section</b> <b>rolling</b> of thick strip, which either could not be rolled at present due to cracking at bent corners. Whereas, the {{second moment of area}} of sections could be increased through sharpened corners and increased gauge thickness. A heat assisted <b>section</b> <b>rolling</b> process is proposed. This process is based on application of high intensity heat on the inner surface of the strip, immediately prior to rolling. To investigate the new <b>section</b> <b>rolling</b> concept, the following work has been carried out. Firstly, the material property of the S 450 steel has been determined using the Gleeble simulator, followed by thermal conductivity tests. Since a freon was used to increase temperature gradient, the heat transfer coefficient for the freon-hot surface interaction was determined. Finally, the four point hot bending tests were conducted to validate the simulation model. For this purpose, a hot bending test rig was designed and fabricated, utilizing an halogen heater as the heat source. The results between experiment and simulation were compared and a good correlation was found. Then, finite element analyses of a single pass hot rolling process has been adopted to investigate the neutral axis shift and section thickening effects. It is revealed that localised heating creates bulging on the compressed surface. The bulged surface affects the both neutral axis and thickening of the formed parts. This research has demonstrated that localised heating has a potential to be employed in <b>section</b> <b>rolling</b> operations. It shows that the neutral axis of the bent region shifted closer to the tensile surface would reduce the tendency for surface cracking. In addition, the increase in thickness that arises at a bend would enhance the stiffness of rolled sections. Ultimately a process window for heat assisted <b>section</b> <b>rolling</b> has been established. Imperial Users Onl...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in gas foil bearing technology {{have led to}} numerous advanced high-speed rotating system concepts, {{many of which have}} become either commercial products or experimental test articles. Examples include Oil-Free microturbines, motors, generators and turbochargers. The driving forces for integrating gas foil bearings into these high-speed systems are the benefits promised by removing the oil lubrication system. Elimination of the oil system leads to reduced emissions, increased reliability, and decreased maintenance costs. Another benefit is reduced power plant weight. For rotorcraft applications, this would be a major advantage, as every pound removed from the propulsion system results in a payload benefit. Implementing foil gas bearings throughout a rotorcraft gas turbine engine is an important long-term goal that requires overcoming numerous technological hurdles. Adequate thrust bearing load capacity and potentially large gearbox applied radial loads are among them. However, by replacing the turbine end, or hot <b>section,</b> <b>rolling</b> element bearing with a gas foil bearing many of the above benefits can be realized. To this end, engine manufacturers are beginning to explore the possibilities of hot section gas foil bearings in propulsion engines. This paper presents a logical follow-on activity by analyzing a conceptual rotorcraft engine to determine the feasibility of a foil bearing supported core. Using a combination of rotordynamic analyses and a load capacity model, it is shown to be reasonable to consider a gas foil bearing core section...|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} the study is the {{high-carbon}} tool cast steel G 200 CrMoNi 4 - 3 - 3 used for metallurgical rolls, especially in <b>section</b> <b>rolling</b> mills. The test material was derived from a roll damaged in production; therefore, the authors had the material in a raw state at their disposal, on which they were able to carry out additional heat treatment operations. The pearlitic matrix of casting steel G 200 CrMoNi 4 - 3 - 3 allows machining to be done to modify the pass or to remove any defects, and the primary and secondary precipitates of carbides enhance the tribological properties. The authors have been for years involved in the optimization of the structure of this material by slight correction to its chemical composition and/or the modification of heat treatment. The presented principles of heat treatment modifications will lead to considerable economic and ecologic profits. It has also been demonstrated that raising slightly the contents of carbide-forming elements, which markedly increases the quantity of transformed ledeburite, results in an enhancement of tribological properties. The analysis of a dozen or so rolls exploited down to the dead roll diameter has shown that roll of cast steel with increased contents of carbon and carbide-forming elements exhibit better service properties, as characterized by the amount of feedstock rolled. Such a method of enhancing the service properties required the assessment of fracture toughness, which was verified using the linear-elastic methods of fracture mechanics...|$|E
40|$|Corus Rail Technologies (CRT) has {{undertaken}} a major project involving track studies of Rolling Contact Fatigue (RCF), {{with support from}} Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU). The work takes a systems approach and involves the development and application of a suite of numerical models used to investigate the in-service conditions of track components with particular emphasis on RCF. The suite of models, called the Track System Model (TSM), comprises of vehicle dynamics models, developed by MMU, a Global Track model and a rail-wheel Contact model, developed by CRT. The modelling is being complemented through the monitoring {{of a number of}} RCF affected sites on the UK network to provide essential empirical data. A total of seven vehicle models have been developed using ADAMS/Rail, including two locomotives, two DMUs, two passenger coaches, and a freight wagon. Vehicle simulations were conducted for a range of UK sites and provided results such as wheel-rail contact forces and contact patch positions. The vehicle models have been validated using track measurements. The results were then used as inputs for the CRT Global Track and Contact models. The Global Track model is a finite element (FE) model that represents a length of railway track and includes the rails, sleepers and ballast. Forces from the vehicle simulations were applied to the Global model in order to predict the bending stresses in the rail head. This was conducted for a number of vehicles at seven sites and the predicted values showed good comparison with track measurements. The Contact FE model is a 3 dimensional (3 D) representation of a wheel <b>section</b> <b>rolling</b> on a short length of rail. Wheel loads calculated from the vehicle dynamics simulations were applied to the contact model in order to predict surface and subsurface stresses, including directional and shear, in the rail head. Subsurface stress distribution is of primary importance for understanding the development of RCF and crack growth. The TSM successfully integrates the vehicle and track aspects of the railway system and provides an accurate method of predicting stresses in rails. When used in conjunction with the practical understanding of RCF, through site monitoring, it will enable the development of analytical fatigue life models that can be used by the track engineer to support future decision making for an optimum rail grinding strategy and rail renewal programme...|$|E

Eight iron-based materials were tested: 3 ledeburitic cast steels, 2 hypereutectoid cast steels, normalized and stress relief annealed steel, hardened and tempered steel and nodular mottled cast iron. Design/methodology/approach: The exploitation tests were performed on the hot rolling mills for selected rolled <b>sections,</b> <b>rolling</b> stands and roll passes. The samples were cut out of the roll in such a way that they contained the roll working surface and were used for metallographic observations of the subsurface zone. Findings: It was found, that uniform distribution of dispersed precipitates of hypereutectoid cementite in the alloy matrix prevents the formation of the white layer {{on the surface of the}} rolls. Research limitations/implications: The white layer definition was given. An influence of the microstructure of iron base alloys on the susceptibility to form the white layer on their surface due to tribological contact was also determined. Practical implications: The procedure for obtaining rolled products of better quality as well as for restricting the probability of roll cracking was proposed. Obtained results should allow proper design of the microstructure of the materials for tools. Originality/value: This work contains several new aspects, which are: the unique tribological conditions for performing the tests, wide range of investigated materials, and combining the microstructure of the material with the susceptibility of the formation of the white layer on its surface.
