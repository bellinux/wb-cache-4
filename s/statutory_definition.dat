25|$|Although this <b>statutory</b> <b>definition</b> broadly {{corresponds}} to its common law counterpart, {{there are two}} key differences. First, unlike the common law offence which requires evidence of a seditious intent, an offender's intention is irrelevant under the Sedition Act, and it suffices that the act possesses the requisite seditious tendency. Thus, it is immaterial that the offender failed to foresee or misjudged the risk {{that his or her}} act would be seditious.|$|E
25|$|In {{most common}} law jurisdictions {{there is a}} Bills of Exchange Act that codifies the law in {{relation}} to negotiable instruments, including cheques, and this Act contains a <b>statutory</b> <b>definition</b> of the term banker: banker includes a body of persons, whether incorporated or not, who carry on the business of banking' (Section 2, Interpretation). Although this definition seems circular, it is actually functional, because it ensures that the legal basis for bank transactions such as cheques {{does not depend on}} how the bank is structured or regulated.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{investigates the}} impact of discourses of authenticity on the development and application of <b>statutory</b> <b>definitions</b> of Gypsies and Travellers in England and Wales since 1959, and the subsequent consequences for access to accommodation for these communities. These definitions are concerned with land use, equalities, housing, and homelessness legislation. The basis of these definitions is found in statute and policy and decision makers ranging from local authorities through to the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) are responsible for their development and application. Each of these definitions has different consequences with regard to access to accommodation. The research examines a chronological analytical narrative of the development and application of these definitions over a 53 year period, which consists of an examination of relevant case law, policy, law and other useful sources. Interviews with key informants involved {{in the development and}} application of <b>statutory</b> <b>definitions</b> serve to reinforce the interpretation of the evidence. The evidence is assessed using the notions of discourses of authenticity, which are constructed as the discourse regarding the authenticity of an individual or group as Gypsies or Travellers as prescribed by other individuals, groups or institutions and the implications of this ascription. There has not been a comprehensive analysis {{of the relationship between the}} discourse around the authenticity of Gypsies and Travellers and <b>statutory</b> <b>definitions</b> in modern times. This research bridges the gap in the existing literature by undertaking a comprehensive analysis of the development, application and consequences of <b>statutory</b> <b>definitions</b> in the light of the existing knowledge on discourses of authenticity with regard to Gypsies and Travellers.

Most rule-making and decision-making is expressly related back to the 'Purpose and Principles' section, Part II, which contains the <b>statutory</b> <b>definition</b> of 'sustainable management' in section 5.

Evaluations were derived from the same 6 criteria but the typical descriptions became unusable. In 1999, a sub-group of the Standing Concertation Committee proposed a new guide for describing Career Paths, adapted to their wider career concept by expanding the 6 evaluation criteria into 9. For each criterion several levels were established tracing the expected evolution of job level profiles and personal competencies over their longer salary ranges. While providing more transparency to supervisors and staff, the Guide's official use would be by services responsible for vacancy notices, Career Path evaluations and related decisions as well as external salary and career comparisons...|$|R
40|$|There {{is no one}} settled {{definition}} of franchising.

This dependency of a franchisee 2 ̆ 7 s business upon that of its franchisor is idiosyncratic to franchising, and, along with related issues of alignment of interests, is well documented in the academic literature.

2500|$|As yet, the UK has not {{consolidated}} a single <b>statutory</b> <b>definition</b> {{of the people}} to whom employment rights and duties apply.

The EU does have one consolidated definition of a ‘worker’, which is someone who has a contract for work in return for a wage, or an indirect quid pro quo (as in a communal cooperative), and also stands as the more vulnerable party to the contract. This reflects the kernel of classical labour law theory, that an employment contract is one infused with [...] "inequality of bargaining power", and stands as a justification for mandating additional terms to what might otherwise be agreed under a system of total freedom of contract.|$|E

The definition of a conservation area is a principally urban area [...] "of special architectural or historic interest, the character or appearance of which it is desirable to preserve or enhance". Such areas are identified according to criteria defined by Sections 69 and 70 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. Crawley Borough Council adds to the <b>statutory</b> <b>definition</b> by stating that the status is granted on the basis of [...] "a number of factors and does not solely relate to the age of the buildings; for instance architectural interest and setting of an area are also important factors." [...] In granting conservation area status, the Council aimed to [...] "protect the distinctive character and appearance of the Almshouses and their landscaped trees and gardens" [...] and to ensure that any development in the surrounding area was appropriate and had no negative impact—especially as to the east lies a site earmarked for large-scale residential development.|$|E
