5|$|The {{earliest}} {{recorded history}} of the Glacier Bay area <b>starts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 1741 Russian expedition of Vitus Bering and Aleksei Chirikov.

2500|$|A Baraita {{reported}} that Rabbi taught that in conferring an honor, we <b>start</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> most important person, while in conferring a curse, we <b>start</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> least important. [...] demonstrates that in conferring an honor, we <b>start</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> most important person, for when Moses instructed Aaron, Eleazar, and Ithamar {{that they should}} not conduct themselves as mourners, Moses spoke first to Aaron and only thereafter to Aaron's sons Eleazar and Ithamar.

5|$|Amino acids {{are either}} used to {{synthesize}} proteins and other biomolecules, or oxidized to urea {{and carbon dioxide}} {{as a source of}} energy. The oxidation pathway <b>starts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> removal of the amino group by a transaminase. The amino group is fed into the urea cycle, leaving a deaminated carbon skeleton {{in the form of a}} keto acid. Several of these keto acids are intermediates in the citric acid cycle, for example the deamination of glutamate forms α-ketoglutarate. The glucogenic amino acids can also be converted into glucose, through gluconeogenesis (discussed below).|$|E
5|$|Another {{approach}} <b>starts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> canonical quantization {{procedures of}} quantum theory. Using the initial-value-formulation {{of general relativity}} (cf. evolution equations above), {{the result is the}} Wheeler–deWitt equation (an analogue of the Schrödinger equation) which, regrettably, turns out to be ill-defined without a proper ultraviolet (lattice) cutoff. However, with the introduction of what are now known as Ashtekar variables, this leads to a promising model known as loop quantum gravity. Space is represented by a web-like structure called a spin network, evolving over time in discrete steps.|$|E
5|$|As {{mandated}} by the Olympic Charter, various elements frame the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games. This ceremony takes place before the events have occurred. Most of these rituals were established at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp. The ceremony typically <b>starts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> hoisting of the host country's flag and a performance of its national anthem. The host nation then presents artistic displays of music, singing, dance, and theatre representative of its culture. The artistic presentations have grown in scale and complexity as successive hosts attempt to provide a ceremony that outlasts its predecessor's in terms of memorability. The opening ceremony of the Beijing Games reportedly cost $100million, {{with much of the}} cost incurred in the artistic segment.|$|E

5|$|Following the lyrics, {{the second}} video <b>starts</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> quartet {{in the front}} of the aeroplane, with Spencer as the captain.

5|$|Four {{days later}} the band {{reassembled}} to try a different arrangement. The second version of the song featured McCartney's Mellotron introduction followed by the refrain. They recorded five takes of the basic tracks for this arrangement (two of which were false <b>starts)</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> last being chosen as best and subjected to further overdubs. Lennon's final vocal was recorded with the tape running fast so that when played back at normal speed the tonality would be altered, giving his voice a slurred sound. This version {{was used for the}} first minute of the released recording.|$|E
