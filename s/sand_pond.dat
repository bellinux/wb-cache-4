After Hardenburg Road, Shandelee Road begins to bend in {{different}} directions, several times {{to the west and}} several times to the east, intersecting with Meyer Road at a fork. CR149, which continues to the left at the fork, heads to the northwest, paralleling Meyer Road to the west. The residences begin to disappear and CR149 continues into a more wooded area, where it intersects with Whittendale Road, a local dead-end road. A short distance from Whittendale Road, CR149 makes a sharp bend to the northeast, intersecting with the northern termini of Stump Pond Road and Meyer Road. Near the intersection with Gilda Lane, CR149 passes the <b>Sand</b> <b>Pond,</b> and intersects with a series of short local roads. Paralleling the shores of <b>Sand</b> <b>Pond</b> for a short distance, Shandelee Road begins to enter the community of Shandelee. There, the highway intersects with Shandelee Lake Road, a short connector highway in the area. CR149 makes a curve to the east, following Shandelee Road for a distance, making several winds in direction until the alignment turns towards the northeast. Shandelee Road continues to the northeast, passing through local woodlands and fields. As CR149 nears Livingston Manor, the name changes from Shandelee Road to Main Street.|$|E

30|$|Although {{a number}} of {{adaptive}} measures are practiced in the study area, in terms of <b>pond</b> <b>sand</b> filters, the greatest challenge is to find suitable ponds that are perennial, free from pisciculture, and protected from use for bathing and washing clothes, watering cattle, and so on. The water for the <b>pond</b> <b>sand</b> filter process comes from ponds that may easily be contaminated and are pathways of waterborne diseases. Therefore, {{it is important that}} measures are implemented to protect the ponds from any source of contamination.
