5|$|During {{preparations}} for the , Ron Dennis, the McLaren CEO and Chairman, noted that the team was encouraged by the aerodynamic data they had collected on the chassis, particularly its mid-corner speeds which he claimed {{were similar to those}} produced by other teams. He further added that the car's performance issues could be traced back to a lack of outright power and poor fuel efficiency from the engine. Éric Boullier, the team principal, further suggested that the main problem that the team faced was improving the efficiency of the RA615H's energy recovery systems, both in harvesting and deploying the additional power, and that by developing these areas, the car could make up several <b>seconds</b> <b>on</b> lap time, enough for the car to compete regularly for podium finishes.|$|E

Carlos Sainz crossed the white line when exiting pit lane, receiving a five-second penalty to be served at his second stop. Bottas {{was the first of the}} front runners to pit on lap 27, emerging into traffic.

5|$|Each round {{began with}} a toss-up {{physical}} challenge in which both teams competed, with the winning team receiving both initial control of the round, and money for their score. After the toss-up, the host began asking trivia questions of the team in control. Each correct answer earned a monetary award, and allowed the team to maintain control, while an incorrect answer, or failure to respond within approximately ten seconds turned control over to the opponents. However, the team could dare their opponents to answer the question, doubling its value; in response, the opponents could double dare for quadruple the original value. When the team in control was challenged to a double dare, they had to either answer or compete in a physical challenge. An incorrect answer, or not responding within approximately five <b>seconds</b> <b>on</b> a dare or double dare, awarded both control and the appropriate {{amount of money to}} the team that issued it. The second round played the same as the first, with question values doubled. On Double Dare and Super Sloppy Double Dare, a question was initially worth $10.
