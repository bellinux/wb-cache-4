5|$|Johnson {{explored}} {{the theme of}} escapism at the Indianapolis Museum of Contemporary Art in a show entitled The Production of Escapism: A Solo Project by Rashid Johnson. He addressed distraction and relief from reality through art and fantasy. Johnson used photos, video and site-specific installation to study escapist tendencies through often with a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> that bordered on the absurd.|$|E
50|$|A {{short while}} later Celia, {{the only female}} worm, was {{replaced}} with fan favorite Chutney, mostly due to the very sophomoric <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> <b>of</b> Frankie who would invariably {{find a way to}} insert a drawing of a penis near her mouth.|$|R

Both {{characters have}} attempted freestyle rapping, including in several episodes featuring Hoodie Allen.|$|R
5|$|Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Elder Paul Ryder, a prickly, {{judgmental}} young missionary assigned as Aaron's partner, Ryder is not {{enthusiastic about}} being in LA and even less so about living next door to a homosexual. Gordon-Levitt originally auditioned to play Aaron, but his aggressive attitude toward the script but good <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> made the producers decide he was a perfect Ryder.|$|E
5|$|Besides his on-court {{fights with}} other players, he has {{exhibited}} confrontational behavior off-court. He {{was arrested for}} breaking a man's nose during a fight after a game with the Milwaukee Bucks and also for throwing a man through a plate-glass window after being struck {{with a glass of}} ice. Barkley continues to be popular with the fans and media because of his <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> and honesty.|$|E
5|$|Ort's Oldies, a used {{record store}} on Jackson Street, and its proprietor, William Orten Carlton, {{commonly}} known as Ort, were among the institutional figures that made the Athens music scene possible. Ort has an excellent memory for rock trivia, which served him well in running the store.

50|$|The Sabols {{have used}} NFL Films to {{showcase}} their <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor,</b> {{as in the}} Football Follies series. The Follies used blooper plays, such as fumbles, dropped passes, deflected or bobbled passes, players slipping and falling, mascots, the quarterback lining up behind the guard instead of the center, and disorganization, and outtakes and silly narration.|$|R
5000|$|They {{are known}} for their goofy <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor,</b> and for how much they poke fun at each other, often during public appearances.

Numerous toons run in to regard Doom's remains, and Roger discovers that he inadvertently wrote his love letter for Jessica on Acme's will, which was written in invisible ink. Roger then shocks Valiant with a joy buzzer, and Valiant gives him a kiss, having regained his <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor.</b> Valiant happily enters Toontown with Dolores, and Roger with Jessica, followed by the other toons.|$|E
5|$|After a {{visit from}} his sick mother, Arletta (Jo Van Fleet), Luke becomes more optimistic about his situation. He {{continually}} confronts the Captain and the guards, and his <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> and independence prove to be both contagious and inspiring to the other prisoners. Luke's struggle for supremacy peaks when he leads a work crew in a seemingly impossible but successful effort to complete a road-paving job in less than one day. The other prisoners start to idolize him after he makes and wins a spur-of-the moment bet that he can eat fifty hard-boiled eggs in one hour.|$|E
5|$|Johansson {{learned some}} Russian {{from a former}} teacher {{on the phone for}} her role of Black Widow in The Avengers (2012), another entry from the MCU. The film {{received}} positive reviews and broke many box office records, becoming the third highest-grossing film both in the United States and worldwide. For her performance, she was nominated for two Teen Choice Awards and three People's Choice Awards. Later that year, Johansson portrayed the actress Janet Leigh in Sacha Gervasi's Hitchcock, a behind-the-scenes drama about the making of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film Psycho. Roger Ebert believed that Johansson did not look much like Leigh, but conveyed her spunk, intelligence, and <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Marl games, {{similar to}} other Nippon Ichi video games, feature goofy <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor,</b> tongue-in-cheek melodrama, and quirky casts of heroes and villains. For instance, Cornet, in Rhapsody, attacks enemies with monstrous storms of {{confectionery}} foods, while her rival, the seemingly polite Etoile, pulls out machine guns on her enemies. Along with the humor, {{there is a certain}} level of girlishness to each game, the plot often focusing on issues of love rather than complex politics and evil demon lords. Each game also features musical numbers.|$|R
6000|$|She had {{suspected}} that her married friends exaggerated their passion for children. But {{in her work}} in the library, children had become individuals to her, citizens of the State with their own rights and their own <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor.</b> In the library she had not had much time to give them, but now she knew the luxury of stopping, gravely asking Bessie Clark whether her doll had yet recovered from its rheumatism, and agreeing with Oscar Martinsen {{that it would be}} Good Fun to go trapping [...] "mushrats." ...|$|R
5000|$|Softline {{stated that}} [...] "Ali Baba {{displays}} a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> creative <b>humor</b> that lifts it above routine adventure games ... The text is fresh, the action fast-paced".

5|$|After {{moderate}} {{sales of}} their debut album Cheshire Cat (1995), released on independent record label Cargo Music, Blink-182 enjoyed {{a small amount}} of success. Throughout 1994 and 1995, the trio vigorously toured nonstop and grew in popularity, mostly in Australia, where audiences embraced the band's irreverent <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> and stage shows. When the trio grew frustrated when fans lamented the inability to purchase Cheshire Cat at their respective local record stores, they began to turn toward other record labels to achieve wider distribution than Cargo. By the end of 1995, problems had become apparent between the trio and the label, who regarded the band as a joke not to be taken seriously.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a career}} high in {{appearances}} in 2004, Rivera did not throw during the offseason, unlike previous years. His 2005 season began {{on a low}} note. After missing time in spring training with elbow bursitis, he blew his first two save opportunities of the season against the Red Sox, marking four consecutive blown opportunities against Boston {{dating back to the}} previous postseason. Fans at Yankee Stadium booed Rivera, and baseball journalists speculated if his days as a dominant pitcher were over. He was subsequently cheered by Red Sox fans during pre-game introductions at Fenway Park the following week, in recognition of his struggles against the Red Sox. He responded to the ovation with a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> by tipping his cap to the crowd.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} theatrical releases of {{the original}} Star Wars trilogy, Jabba the Hutt first appeared in Return of the Jedi (1983), though he is mentioned in Star Wars (1977) and The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and a previously deleted scene involving Jabba the Hutt {{was added to the}} 1997 theatrical re-release and subsequent home media releases of Star Wars. Jabba is introduced as the de facto leader of the Desilijic-Hutt Cartel, and the most powerful crime boss on Tatooine, who has a bounty on Han Solo's head. Jabba employs a retinue of career criminals, bounty hunters, smugglers, assassins and bodyguards to operate his criminal empire. He keeps a host of entertainers at his disposal at his palace: slaves, droids and alien creatures. Jabba has a grim <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor,</b> an insatiable appetite, and affinities for gambling, slave girls, and torture.|$|E

5|$|No {{drawings}} or {{paintings of}} Sherwood exist, but contemporary accounts describe her as attractive and tall and possessing a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor.</b> Sherwood wore trousers {{instead of a}} dress while working on her farm. This was unusual for the time, as was her herb growing. The combination of clothing and good looks was said to attract men and upset their wives. Sherwood biographer and advocate Belinda Nash suggests that Sherwood's neighbors may have been jealous of Sherwood, and that the witchcraft tales may have been conjured up {{in an effort to}} remove her from, and subsequently get, her property. Sherwood was a party to at least a dozen lawsuits, in which she had to defend against accusations of witchcraft, or in which she sued her accusers for slander.|$|E
5|$|Set in 1964 (three {{decades before}} {{the events of}} the {{original}} Metal Gear), the story centers on FOX operative codenamed Naked Snake as he attempts to rescue a Russian rocket scientist by the name of Nikolai Stepanovich Sokolov, sabotage an experimental superweapon, and assassinate his defected former boss. While previous games were set in a primarily urban environment, Snake Eater adopts a 1960s Soviet jungle setting, with the high tech, near-future trappings of previous Metal Gear Solid games being replaced with the wilderness. While the setting has changed, the game's focus remains on stealth and infiltration, while retaining the series' self-referential, fourth wall-breaking <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor.</b> The story of Snake Eater is told through numerous cut scenes and radio conversations.|$|E
5|$|In his {{comic book}} appearances, the Joker {{is portrayed as}} a {{criminal}} mastermind. Introduced as a psychopath with a warped, sadistic <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor,</b> the character became a goofy prankster in the late 1950s in response to regulation by the Comics Code Authority, before returning to his darker roots during the early 1970s. As Batman's nemesis, the Joker {{has been part of}} the superhero's defining stories, including the murder of Jason Todd—the second Robin and Batman's ward—and the paralysis of one of Batman's allies, Barbara Gordon. The Joker has had various possible origin stories during his decades of appearances. The most common story involves him falling into a tank of chemical waste which bleaches his skin white, turns his hair green, and his lips bright red; the resulting disfigurement drives him insane. The antithesis of Batman in personality and appearance, the Joker is considered by critics to be his perfect adversary.|$|E
5000|$|The Down Beat {{review by}} Aaron Cohen says [...] "Try to imagine Eric Dolphy {{with a more}} audible <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the <b>humor</b> {{combined}} with a more beat-heavy Herbie Nichols, and the resulting blend would approximate Steam." ...|$|R
40|$|It {{has often}} been {{proposed}} that claims about what is funny, delicious, or likely are “subjective, ” {{in the sense that}} their truth depends not only on how things are with the objects they explicitly concern, but on how things are with some subject not explicitly mentioned. This thought is supported by the striking degree to which we differ in our judgements about these matters. If there are wholly objective properties of funniness, deliciousness, or likelihood, then most of us must be defective in our capacity to detect them. We are humor-blind, or taste-blind, or likelihood-blind, {{in much the same way}} that some of us are color-blind. But this diagnosis clashes with the way we think and talk about these domains. In our judgements about what is delicious, we lack the humility color-blind people show in their judgements about what is red or green. We do not seem to regard the fact that many others disagree with us as grounds for caution in calling foods delicious. We readily judge things to be funny in light <b>of</b> our own <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor,</b> even though when challenged we can offer no grounds for thinking our <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> are the “right ” ones. We readily judge things to be likely in light of what we know, even while acknowledging that our knowledge is only partial, and that others may know more tha...|$|R
5000|$|Grant and Hynes {{have been}} {{described}} as having [...] "well-deserved reputations as seekers of the edge". Outside of Two Lumps, Hynes often writes in the horror genre, and Grant has also written horror novels and illustrated violent material. However, Hynes has rejected the characterization that the relatively tame content of Two Lumps could be construed as self-censorship, stating that [...] "While we're not deliberately striving for 'family-friendly', by any means, the Lumps tend to lend themselves towards more intellectual and sardonic jokes than visceral ones... James and I both have very viscerally-twisted <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor,</b> but we tend to have other creative outlets for that than Two Lumps." ...|$|R
5|$|Matthew Perry portrays Chandler Bing, an {{executive}} in statistical analysis and data reconfiguration for a large, multinational corporation. Chandler hates this job, although it pays well. He attempts to quit during season one, but is lured {{back with a}} new office and a pay raise. He eventually quits this job in season nine due to a transfer to Tulsa. He becomes a junior copywriter at an advertising agency later that season. Chandler has a peculiar family history being {{the son of an}} erotic novelist mother and a gay, cross-dressing Las Vegas star father. Chandler is known for his sarcastic <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> and bad luck in relationships. Chandler marries Monica in season seven, and they adopt twins {{at the end of the}} series. Before his relationship with Monica, Chandler dated Janice Hosenstein in season one and subsequently broke up with her many times. Matthew Perry has expressed his similarities to the character, such as his need to break an awkward silence with a joke and difficulties with women when first joining the show.|$|E
5|$|Writing the {{screenplay}} took about six months. During this period, Gidding worked alone, {{and although he}} passed some of his work to Wise to show him that work on {{the screenplay}} was progressing well, he and Wise did not otherwise collaborate on the screenplay. The screenplay made other changes to the story. The number of characters was cut down, the back story was significantly shortened, most of the supernatural events depicted in the novel were kept off-screen, and {{the greater part of}} the action was set inside the house to heighten the audience's feeling of claustrophobia. Eleanor's role as an outcast was also emphasized. The character of Theodora was given a sharper, slightly more cruel <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> in order to make her a foil for Eleanor but also to heighten Eleanor's outsider status. The role of Luke was made more flippant, and Dr. Markway (Montague in the novel) was made a more confident character. The screenplay was finished just after Wise completed work on West Side Story.|$|E
5|$|For the remake, Freddy {{was brought}} back to his darker roots {{and away from the}} comical {{character}} he had become in later Nightmare on Elm Street sequels. Fuller pointed out that this Freddy does have one-liners, but his comments come from a darker <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> and not intended to be as campy as previously seen. In addition, it was decided to follow Craven's original characterization of Freddy as a child molester. The decision to apply that characteristic was based in part on the idea that there would not be much of a story to tell if he simply killed children for no apparent reason. It would be easy for the teenage characters to figure out, whereas it is easier to hide the idea of children being molested and force the teen characters to seek out the truth of what happened. In an effort to keep the story fresh, Heisserer developed the concept of micro-naps. In the story, as the characters prolong their time without sleeping they begin to experience micro-naps, which is where a character will unknowingly start dreaming while they are still awake. The micro-naps allowed the filmmakers the chance to blur the lines between reality and the dreamworld by offering an explanation for how the characters could slip so easily into a dream.|$|E
500|$|With {{just four}} chords and one manic tempo, New York's Ramones blasted open the clogged arteries of mid-'70s rock, reanimating the music. Their genius was to {{recapture}} the short/simple aesthetic from which pop had strayed, adding a caustic <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> trash-culture <b>humor</b> and minimalist rhythm guitar sound.|$|R
50|$|Sid Couchey (May 24, 1919 - March 11, 2012) was an American {{comic book}} artist {{best known for}} his work on the Harvey Comics {{characters}} Richie Rich, Little Lotta and Little Dot. His style is known for big, friendly faces and a sharp <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> visual <b>humor.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The name New Reformed Orthodox Order of the Golden Dawn {{was coined}} {{since it was}} a wholly new Tradition, it was Orthodox since it took its beliefs from the ancients, and it was a Magical Order as was the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. They {{considered}} themselves in some sense the spiritual and magical successors of the Golden Dawn. The name was also chosen as a way to screen out would-be members lacking <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> (personal communication to Isaac Bonewits). Bonewits considers NROOGD to be the quintessential (and probably the first) [...] "California Eclectic" [...] Wiccan Tradition, near the [...] "liberal/heterodox" [...] end of his Wiccan spectrum of [...] "orthodoxy/heterodoxy." ...|$|R
