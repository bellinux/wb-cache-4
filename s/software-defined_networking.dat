Juniper Networks entered the IT security market with its own JProtect security toolkit in 2003 before acquiring security company NetScreen Technologies the following year. It entered the enterprise segment in the early 2000s, which accounted for one-third of revenues by 2005.

40|$|Increasingly, middleboxes {{are being}} {{deployed}} as software components and, {{with the advent}} of software defined networking, can be deployed at arbitrary locations. However, existing approaches for controlling the operations of middleboxes continue to be rudimentary and ad hoc. As such, a variety of dynamic network control scenarios that are crucial to enhancing the security, availability and performance of enterprise applications cannot be realized today. In this paper, we ask: what is the right way to exercise unified control over the actions of middlebox that enables sophisticated dynamic network control scenarios? Inspired by SDN, we argue that a <b>software-defined</b> middlebox <b>networking</b> (SDMBN) framework?which provides fine-grained, programmatic control over all MB state in concert with control over the network?is the answer to this question. Thus, we present the design and implementation of OpenMB. OpenMB consists of slightly modified middleboxes that expose a southbound API for importing/exporting middlebox state, a middlebox controller that implements a northbound API to define how state can be accessed or placed, and scenario-specific control applications that orchestrate middlebox and network changes in tandem...|$|R
40|$|In this invited contribution, {{we discuss}} {{technology}} options for bandwidth-variable transceivers which are key components for {{the realization of}} flexible <b>software-defined</b> optical <b>networking.</b> Bandwidth-variable transceivers enable the software-controlled adaptation of physical layer parameters such as transmitted bit rate, spectral efficiency and transparent reach according to the traffic demands at hand. In particular, we focus on recent advances in four-dimensional modulation formats and in modulation format transparent data-aided digital signal processing. It is argued that four-dimensional modulation formats present an attractive complement to conventional polarization-multiplexed formats {{in the context of}} bandwidth-variable transceivers, where they enable a smooth transition with respect to spectral efficiency while requiring marginal additional hardware effort. Results of numerical simulations and experiments supporting this statement are presented. For the cost-efficient hardware implementation of bandwidth-variable transceivers supporting several polarization-multiplexed and four-dimensional modulation formats, digital signal processing algorithms are required which operate format transparent and consume little hardware resources. We discuss data-aided signal processing as one possible option, in particular with respect to carrier frequency recovery and channel estimation in combination with frequency domain equalization...|$|R
40|$|SDN（Software Defined Networking）的想法最早由斯坦福Martin Gasado在Sigcomm 2007 提出，近年来逐渐受到学术界和产业界的极大关注。SDN具有集中式全局优化、细粒度的流量区分、统一的管理接口和网络在线可编程等特点，适合作为工业控制网络的基础架构。但当前的SDN技术和设备主要是面向商用的数据中心和园区网，对工业控制网络中最关心的实时性保障方面没有针对性的研究，因此本文首先会给出工业SDN控制网络架构，给出工业SDN的运行机制。接下来，为了对多个工业控制应用的业务流在工业控制网络上的时延进行确定性定量分析，本文使用网络演算对工业控制网进行建模和分析；对工业应用产生的数据流具有关联性的特点，对数据流之间的相互关系进行了细粒度的描述；对有线和无线交换机对数据包不同的处理模式，分别构建了其交换模型；针对网络演算模型解算复杂的问题，设计了基于仿射曲线的模型解算方法，能够快速对模型进行计算，提高了模型的可用性。 在模型的基础上，针对现有以太网静态优先级调度方式粒度过粗的问题，提出一种基于SDN的工业控制网络动态优先级调度架构，支持细粒度的实时性调度；该调度算法的特点是改变最小化时延的调度目标，提出以时延保障为约束，最小化网络资源使用的动态调度方法，调度方法使用基于网络演算的网络模型，该模型在时延上界的刻画方面更加精确；引入了网络演算最小加卷积的使调度方法的复杂性大大提高，本文使用仿射变换的方法将基于最小加卷积的NP优化问题转化成基于普通加法的动态优化问题，使调度算法能够在多项式时间内完成。针对工业测控应用SOA化、web化的发展趋势，提出了基于SDN的工业消息总线服务中间件，对其中的Pub/Sub路由与网络、计算资源调度进行了深入的分析，指出了路由与调度间复杂的耦合关系，给出了形式化的描述；针对该问题，提出了基于蚁群算法的优化方法，该方法通过蚁群算法正反馈的原理将路由与调度进行分离，调度的结果以信息素更新的方式反馈到路由过程中，避免了过多的优化参数；将蚁群算法中蚂蚁进行路径选择的参数适时的进行进化，避免进入局部最优解；在信息素更新的过程中，结合了以最小化整体代价为目标的启发式算法，使蚁群的收敛方向更有指向性，加快收敛速度。最后，提出了工业SDN的指标体系，用于评价工业SDN网络交换机和控制器。针对Openflow标准协议无法满足工业实时的要求的现状，给出了Openflow协议在工业场景中的协议扩展方案，研制了工业SDN交换机实现实时调度方法，在可重构智能制造演示示范线上，对指标体系中的重要指标进行了实验验证。The new {{industry}} revolution calls for highly flexible and robust networking， which {{is difficult for}} the traditional networks due to limitations on network structure and management. The future industrial networks are required to adapt to changes of the locations and connections of the manufacturing entities. It requires flat and all IP-based networking for simpler data mapping and conversion， and real-time guarantee for transmissions of mission-critical messages. Meanwhile， it requires dynamic online configurations of the manufacturing systems to minimize time and energy consumption when order changes. To meet above-stated networking requirements， the thesis proposes a general architecture of <b>software-defined</b> industrial <b>networking</b> (SDIN) and related technologies. The proposed SDIN separates network control and data forwarding， thus allows for higher efficient， more flexible and more stable networking; network reconfiguration and changes can be done fully online without interrupting production. This thesis will propose an SDN industrial control network architecture， focusing on the characteristics and different of industrial SDN. Next to the forwarding behavior modeling industry SDN switch， the existing switched Ethernet data stream associated with poor scheduling model， the model coarse granularity {{issues such as the}} design of industrial control network switch model， the existing Model Calculation of high complex， slow problem， a model based on the affine curve solution method， and its applicability to prove. Next，a real-time scheduling of industrial control network architecture software-defined network architecture is proposed，supporting online operation. The data streams can dynamically joined under efficient scheduling mechanism. This thesis will analyze the industrial service bus middleware Pub / Sub mode of operation proposed for industrial-based SDN architecture middleware message bus service. The bus service message on the impact of industrial real-time middleware factors were analyzed, and Pub / Sub Route combined with the scheduling optimization problem and propose heuristic search algorithm and ant colony and genetic algorithm combined solutions.

40|$|Enterprise {{wide area}} network (WAN) is a private network that connects the {{computers}} and other devices across an organisation's branch locations and the data centers. It forms the backbone of enterprise communication. Currently, multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) is commonly used to provide this service. As a recent alternative to MPLS, <b>software-defined</b> wide area <b>networking</b> (SD-WAN) solutions are being introduced as an IP based cloud-networking service for enterprises. SD-WAN virtualizes the networking service and eases the complexity of configuring and managing the enterprise network by moving these tasks to software and a central controller. The introduction of new technologies causes concerns about their security. Also, this new solution is introduced {{as a replacement for}} MPLS, which has been considered secure and has been in use for more than 16 years. Thus, {{there is a need to}} analyze the security of SD-WAN, which is the goal of this thesis. In this thesis, we perform a security analysis of a commercial SD-WAN solution, by finding its various attack surfaces, associated vulnerabilities and design weaknesses. We choose Nuage VNS, an SD-WAN product provided by Nuage Networks, as the analysis target. As a result, many attack surfaces and security weaknesses were found and reported, especially in the Customer Premises Equipment (CPE). In particular, we found vulnerabilities in the CPE's secure bootstrapping method and demonstrated some attacks by exploiting them. Finally, we propose mitigation steps to avoid the attacks. The results of this thesis will help both the service provider and the SD-WAN solution vendor to know about the attack surfaces and weaknesses of SD-WAN before offering it to their customers. We also help in implementing the temporary countermeasures to mitigate the attacks. The results have been presented to the service provider and the vendor of the SD-WAN product...|$|R
