40|$|The {{measurement}} of moisture in building fabrics {{has been of}} interest for many years due to the potentially devastating consequences of moisture problems within buildings. A range of potential techniques are available with which to measure the moisture content of building fabrics in-situ and this paper focuses on one particular technique, the ‘thermal dual-probe’. Note that this method is distinct from the <b>single</b> <b>probe</b> <b>technique.</b> Essentially, a short pulse of electrical energy is applied to a wire within the ‘heating ’ needle. A separate ‘temperature sensor ’ needle, which incorporates a thermocouple (for example), records the resulting maximum temperature rise in the material at a certain distance from the heating needle from which the moisture content can be deduced. This approach offers the potential for some significant advantages over existing techniques. Whilst the technique has been successfully applied to soil measurements, a reliable and appropriate dual-probe system for in-situ measurements in building fabrics has not previously been established. This study (funded by the UK Government's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council) has, for the first time, successfully optimised the technique for this particular application via extensive Finite Element modelling and experimental work. Previous work by the authors has compared moistur...|$|E
40|$|A new {{measurement}} technique called fiber optic reflectometer (FOR) {{was developed to}} investigate multiphase flows. The principle and setup of the FOR technique were introduced and applied to various experiments. Based on the coherently mixed signal between the Fresnel reflection off the fiber-liquid interface and the scattered signal off the object, such as a gas bubble, and a solid particle, this <b>single</b> <b>probe</b> <b>technique</b> is capable of simultaneously measuring the velocity of the object with a high accuracy and the phase of the fluid. In addition, bubble diameter, velocity, and void fraction were measured directly. By means of a simple modification of the FOR technique, solute concentration and refractive index change were measured with a greatly improved accuracy. This modified technique was used for measuring of a NaCl concentration in deionized water to validate a new normalization technique. In {{the second part of}} this thesis, a plunging breaking wave in deep water has been studied. Using the wave focusing method, a strong plunging breaker was generated with accuracy in the deep water condition in a two-dimensional wave tank. It was possible to describe the breaking process in detail using a high speed camera with a frame rate of 500 or 1000 fps. Four kinds of experimental techniques were employed or developed to investigate the plunging breaker. Bubble image velocimetry (BIV) and particle image velocimetry (PIV) were used to measure the velocity fields. The velocity fields of the highly aerated region were obtained from the BIV measurements. In addition, the modified PIV technique is capable of measuring the velocities in the entire flow field including the aerated region. Mean and turbulent properties were obtained by the ensemble average. The mean velocity, mean vorticity, and mean kinetic energy were examined over the entire flow field. In addition, the Reynolds stresses and turbulent kinetic energy were calculated with high temporal and spatial resolutions. Free surface elevation was obtained from wave gauge measurements. BIV and PIV images were also used to obtain the free surface elevation and the boundary of the aerated region for more accurate results. The FOR technique was used to obtain the void ratio at each splash-up region. Compressibility of the plunging breaker was considered. Mass flux, momentum flux, kinetic energy, and Reynolds stresses at each FOR station were recalculated using the void ratio obtained from the FOR measurements. All terms at the first splash-up region were highly overestimated more than 100 percent unless the void ratio was applied to the calculation of fluxes and energies. Compared with the fully developed first splash-up region, the overestimation at the second and third splash-up was less significant. However, most terms were overestimated by 20 ~ 30 percent when the void ratio was not considered...|$|E

40|$|A 9. 25 A low‐pressure (45 – 55 mTorr) {{hollow cathode}} arc {{discharge}} {{has been used}} to simulate plasma processes that occur at the anode of magnetoplasmadynamic accelerators used for space propulsion applications. The interest in the near‐anode region is related to findings of past research, which indicate that large anode sheath potentials can drive as much as 70 % of the input electrical power into the anode, thus degrading thrust efficiency. Presented here are results that essentially characterize the behavior of the near‐anode plasma as a function of a transverse magnetic field. Plasma diagnostics included <b>single</b> Langmuir <b>probe</b> <b>techniques,</b> emission spectroscopy, and water calorimetry for anode heat flux measurements. Phenomenological arguments based on measurements taken suggest that observed changes in anode fall voltage are related to variations in the measured local electron number density as the magnetic field is varied.

A {{plasma source}} based on surfatron was {{developed}} and subjected to detailed diagnostics {{with the aim of}} future technological applications e. g. surface activation, biomedical application, plasma sterilisation etc. The surfatron powered by a microwave magnetron generator working at frequency 2. 45 GHz in the output power range 0 – 300 W created plasma from the flowing gas in a quartz tube which is inserted into the surfatron body (resonator cavity).

40|$|AbstractA glow {{discharge}} ion source has been constructed {{for the mass}} spectrometric analysis of organic compounds. Characterization of the source has been made by studying the effect of pressure and discharge current on ionic distributions by anodic ion sampling along the discharge axis. Ion and electron densities and electronic temperatures have been calculated by using the <b>single</b> Langmuir <b>probe</b> <b>technique</b> to correlate the extraction efficiency with measured ion distributions and gain {{some insight into the}} ionization of organic molecules. The spectra obtained for several classes of organic compounds show that formation of parent-molecular ions by proton transfer, resulting partly from the background water molecules, is a major low energy process while charge transfer, Penning ionization, and electron ionization are probably responsible for the fragmentation observed. The spectra result from the simultaneous occurrence of high and low energy reactions, and their structural information content is very high, yielding both molecular and extensive fragment ion information. The {{glow discharge}} ion source has proved to be essentially maintenance-free, easy to operate, stable, and can be used at reasonable mass resolution (up to 7000). The source also provides picogram range detection limits and has a linear response range of about six orders of magnitude, which makes it an interesting ion source for routine analysis. Preliminary work conducted with chromatographic interfaces indicates that its use can be easily extended to both gas and liquid chromatography...|$|R

It is used to calculate the EEDF in the electron energy range larger than –e(Vf − Vp) from the I–V double probe characteristics. Vf and Vp are the floating and plasma potential, respectively. The analytical distribution function corresponding to the best fit of EEDF in the energy range larger than e(Vf − Vp) allows the determination of the total electron density (ne) and the mean electron energy ().

40|$|Abstract. Most of the routing {{protocols}} in wireless ad hoc networks, such as DSR, assume nodes are trustworthy and cooperative. This assumption renders wireless ad hoc networks vulnerable to {{various types of}} Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. We present a distributed <b>probing</b> <b>technique</b> to detect and mitigate one type of DoS attacks, namely malicious packet dropping, in wireless ad hoc networks. A malicious node can promise to forward packets but in fact fails to do so. In our distributed <b>probing</b> <b>technique,</b> every node in the network will probe the other nodes periodically to detect {{if any of them}} fail to perform the forwarding function. Subsequently, node state information can be utilized by the routing protocol to bypass those malicious nodes. Our experiments show that in a moderately changing network, the <b>probing</b> <b>technique</b> can detect most of the malicious nodes with a relatively low false positive rate. The packet delivery rate in the network can also be increased accordingly...|$|R
