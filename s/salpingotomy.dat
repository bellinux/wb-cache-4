The meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5. 3 software. The registration number is CRD 42015017545 in PROSPERO. Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and eight cohort studies, including a total of 1, 229 patients, were znalyzed. The meta-analysis of the RCT subgroup indicated that there was no statistically significant difference in IUP rates (RR = 1. 04, 95 % CI = 0. 89 - 1. 21, P = 0. 61) nor the repeat ectopic pregnancy (REP) rate (RR = 1. 30, 95 % CI = 0. 72 - 2. 38, P = 0. 39) between the <b>salpingotomy</b> and salpingectomy group. In contrast, the cohort study subgroup analysis revealed that the IUP rate was higher in the <b>salpingotomy</b> group compared with the salpingectomy group (RR = 1. 24, 95 % CI = 1. 08 - 1. 42, P = 0. 002); <b>Salpingotomy</b> also increased the risk of REP rate (RR = 2. 27, 95 % CI = 1. 12 - 4. 58, P = 0. 02).

30|$|Unsurprisingly, {{women with}} EP were {{significantly}} more likely to have contralateral tubal pathology. There has always been some debate as to what type of surgery should be performed in women with a damaged contralateral tube (The Management of Tubal Pregnancy 2004). The consensus is that women should be treated on an individual basis with informed consent. If the contralateral tube is damaged and preservation of fertility is a priority, then a <b>salpingotomy</b> is advised, as although this increases the chance of recurrent EP to 20  %, the chance of intrauterine pregnancy is 50  %. Extrapolation from this would mean that if women have a recurrent EP, ideally they should have a <b>salpingotomy,</b> which again needs additional surgical expertise. Although in the short-term a <b>salpingotomy</b> is more expensive, due to additional post-operative follow up and treatment for persistent trophoblast that may become necessary, the reduced need for assisted conception renders this treatment more cost-effective in the long-term (The Management of Tubal Pregnancy 2004; Mol et al. 1997).|$|E
40|$|Editorial commentThe {{standard}} {{surgical procedure}} {{for treatment of}} tubal ectopic pregnancy is salpingectomy, in which the affected fallopian tube is removed. A feasible alternative intervention, <b>salpingotomy,</b> has been promoted since 1957. With this procedure, the pregnancy is removed while the affected tube is preserved. There are 2 risks associated with salpingotomy: a repeated ectopic pregnancy in the same tube and a persistent trophoblast requiring additional treatment. Despite these potential drawbacks, <b>salpingotomy</b> has been widely used and often preferred over salpingectomy {{because it has been}} assumed that preservation of both tubes increased the prospects for a future pregnancy. However, limited data support this assumption, and it remains unclear whether the potential benefits of <b>salpingotomy</b> outweigh the risks. The aim of this open-label, multicenter, randomized controlled trial was to determine whether <b>salpingotomy</b> improves rates of ongoing pregnancy by natural conception compared with salpingectomy.

40|$|Introduction: Though laparoscopic <b>salpingotomy</b> is the {{preferred}} conservative surgery of choice in patients desirous of future fertility, the management of ectopic pregnancy has changed extensively. Other modalities like medical management with Methotrexate are being reviewed for conservative management of tubal pregnancy...|$|E
40|$|There is {{an ongoing}} debate whether tubal ectopic {{pregnancy}} should be treated by <b>salpingotomy</b> or salpingectomy. It is unknown which treatment women prefer {{in view of the}} potentially better fertility outcome but disadvantages of <b>salpingotomy.</b> This study investigated women surgically treated for tubal ectopic pregnancy and subfertile women desiring pregnancy and their preferences for <b>salpingotomy</b> relative to salpingectomy by means of a web-based discrete choice experiment consisting of 16 choice sets. Scenarios representing <b>salpingotomy</b> differed in three attributes: intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) chance, risk of persistent trophoblast and risk of repeat ectopic pregnancy. An 'opt out' alternative, representing salpingectomy, was similar for every choice set. A multinomial logistic regression model was used to analyse relative importance of the attributes. This study showed that the negative effect of repeat ectopic pregnancy was 1. 6 times stronger on the preference of women compared with the positive effect of the spontaneous IUP rate. For all women, the risk of persistent trophoblast was acceptable if compensated by a small rise in the spontaneous IUP rate. The conclusion was that women preferred avoiding a repeat ectopic pregnancy to a higher probability of a spontaneous IUP in the surgical treatment of tubal ectopic pregnancy. An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg gets stuck inside the Fallopian tube where it starts growing instead of passing on to the uterus. This may lead to serious problems, such as internal bleeding and pain. Therefore, in the majority of women, it is necessary to remove the ectopic pregnancy by means of an operation. Two types of surgery are being used in removing the ectopic pregnancy. A conservative approach, <b>salpingotomy,</b> preserves the tube but bears the risk of incomplete removal of the pregnancy tissue (persistent trophoblast), which then needs additional treatment, and of a repeat ectopic pregnancy in the same tube in the future. A radical approach, salpingectomy, bears no risk of persistent trophoblast and limits the risk of repeat tubal pregnancy, but leaves only one tube for reproductive capacity. It is unknown which type of operation is better, especially for future fertility. We investigated women's preferences between these two treatments for ectopic pregnancy, i. e. does a better fertility prognosis outweigh the potential disadvantages of persistent trophoblast and an increased risk for ectopic pregnancy in the future? The study results show in the surgical treatment of tubal ectopic pregnancy that women preferred avoiding a repeat ectopic pregnancy to gaining a higher chance of a spontaneous intrauterine pregnancy. The risk of additional treatment in the case of persistent trophoblast after <b>salpingotomy</b> was acceptable if compensated by a small rise in intrauterine pregnancy rat...|$|E
30|$|Conservative {{management}} of interstitial pregnancies {{is safe and}} effective in selective cases without impairing future fertility.Laparoscopic treatment involves cornulal resection, cornuostomy or <b>salpingotomy</b> {{and it should be}} the preferred operative option in clinically stable patients.Cornual resection due to catastrophic bleeding sometimes might result in a hysterectomy.|$|E
30|$|Salpingectomy is the commonest {{procedure}} {{performed for}} tubal ectopic pregnancy in UK {{in contrast with}} most of the European countries where <b>salpingotomy</b> is what is attempted first.

40|$|Background. Surgery is {{sometimes}} {{required for the}} management of tubal ectopic pregnancies. Historically, surgeons used electrosurgery to obtain hemostasis. Topical hemostatic sealants, such as FloSeal, may decrease the reliance on electrosurgery and reduce thermal injury to the tissue. Case. A 33 -year-old G 1 P 0 received methotrexate for a right tubal pregnancy. The patient became symptomatic six days later and underwent a laparoscopic right <b>salpingotomy.</b> After multiple unsuccessful attempts to obtain hemostasis with electrocoagulation, FloSeal was used and hemostasis was obtained. Six weeks later, a hysterosalpingogram (HSG) confirmed tubal patency. The patient subsequently had an intrauterine pregnancy. Conclusion.

40|$|The {{rationale}} for the conservative management of ectopic pregnancy is the preservation of reproductive potential. Removal of trophoblast through a linear incision (<b>salpingotomy)</b> can be easily performed by endoscopy. The injection of vasopressin into the broad ligament is required in less than 10 % of cases and its routine use is not recommended {{because of the risk}} of severe side-effects. The techniques in cases of isthmic or cornual tubal pregnancy are also described. Other alternatives such as expectant management, methotrexate, RU 486 and prostaglandins have also recently been proposed. Although methotrexate therapy has been demonstrated to be effective in cases of unruptured tubal pregnancy, further studies are needed {{to determine whether or not}} this medical therapy is a safer option than laparoscopic surgery and to compare the subsequent intrauterine and recurrent ectopic pregnancy rates. Endoscopic <b>salpingotomy</b> is an efficacious procedure. Indeed, residual trophoblast is found in only 5 % of cases after this surgical procedure. In these cases of persistent trophoblast, methotrexate is proposed as the medical approach of choice. Evaluation of the postoperative fertility after linear <b>salpingotomy</b> demonstrates an intrauterine pregnancy rate of 63 % and a recurrent ectopic pregnancy rate of 8 %. In conclusion, endoscopic management of tubal pregnancy is a safe and efficacious therapy. The contraindications are relative and depend essentially on the surgeon's experience. Peer reviewe...|$|E

30|$|From this study, we {{conclude}} that, in patients desiring further fertility, both laparoscopy and laparotomy can achieve fertility preservation following basic microsurgical principles. Better {{results could be}} significantly achieved following laparoscopic surgery. High fertility is seen in patients younger than 30  years, in multiparous women, if the contralateral tube is free, if concomitant adhesiolysis is performed, and after <b>salpingotomy</b> operation for treating EP.|$|E
30|$|The {{treatment}} options of laparotomy or methotrexate injection were discussed with the patient, and she chose the medical option. An injection of methotrexate at the dose of 1  mg/kg was given intramuscularly 8  days after the salpingectomy (27  days after the <b>salpingotomy).</b> Although the serum Bhcg level dropped following the injection, {{it started to}} rise again. The patient continued to have abdominal pain, and a laparotomy was agreed upon.|$|E
30|$|The {{management}} of ectopic pregnancy is an example. The European {{view is that}} <b>salpingotomy</b> with preservation of the fallopian tube is the preferred method of treatment whenever possible, whereas the RCOG advice is salpingectomy unless the other fallopian tube is damaged [2]. For both treatment methods, the evidence base {{is far from clear}} and is based on low-grade evidence. It is likely that different, if unpublished, departmental guidelines exist throughout Europe.|$|E
40|$|Objective. We {{investigated}} {{the outcome of}} laparoscopic <b>salpingotomy</b> for tubal pregnancy by follow-up hysterosalpingography (HSG) or second look laparoscopy (SLL) and reexamined the indication and limitation of this conservative surgery. Study Design. From April 1991 to December 2003, we treated one hundred and eighty one cases of tubal pregnancy by laparoscopic <b>salpingotomy.</b> The tubal patency was assessed by either HSG or SLL performed at three months post-surgery. The successful patients at initial operation and the confirmed ipsilateral patent tubes at follow-up were classified as true successful cases (Group I). Even after successful operation, if the treated tubes were found occluded, they were considered as failure cases. Therefore, unsuccessful cases at initial surgery {{as well as at}} follow-up were categorized as Group II. Results. One hundred thirty four cases (74 %) were successfully treated by <b>salpingotomy</b> at initial laparoscopy and also 85 of them (63. 4 %) were found truly successful at follow-up (Group I). The remaining 47 cases (26. 0 %) were unsuccessful at initial surgery and 18 (13. 4 %) cases at follow-up (Group II). Other patients who refused to accept a tubal patency test or not examined as a result of personal reason or lost follow-up comprised 31 cases. No difference in surgical outcome was observed with gestational age, intra-operative hemorrhage, size or anatomic location of pregnancy mass, and preoperative adhesions of the fallopian tube between these two groups of patients. However, pre-operative serum levels of hCG were significantly higher in Group II compared with Group I. In addition, the failure cases were more frequently associated with positive fetal heart beat (FHB), tubal rupture and a preoperative serum levels of hCG of more than 10, 000 IU/L (p< 0. 05, χ 2 test). The Log-rank test indicated a higher success in achieving pregnancy in Group I (p< 0. 05) than in Group II who desired for future pregnancy. Conclusion. Laparoscopic <b>salpingotomy</b> can be equally practiced as a conservative surgery for also proximal ectopic pregnancy and gestational mass size is not so much important and not a relative contraindication for conservative laparoscopic surgery as previously reported. Low preoperative hCG levels, absence of FHB, absence of tubal rupture initially or minimal rupture may be considered as suitable parameters for successful surgery and achieving future pregnancy.
