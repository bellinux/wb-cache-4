500|$|Berkowitz (real name Scott Putesky) later {{claimed to}} have been [...] "shut out" [...] of {{recording}} sessions, and alleged that other band members destroyed much of his equipment—the four-track recorder, which had been used to produce many of the band's early demos, had been microwaved, and his drum machine had been discarded. The latter was subsequently revealed to have been thrown from a second-story window. He was also highly critical of Reznor, whom he alleged destroyed a Fender Jaguar which had been given to him by his father as a child, saying: [...] "I was in the studio, and they were all in the control room, and I'm playing guitar. At the end, Trent says, 'Do it again, but do it more like this.' We went through this three times, and he says, 'Hold on. I'll come in there. Let me show you what I'm talking about.' <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> my guitar off, hand it to him—and he smashes it, just to fuck with me. Then he laughed and left the room." ...|$|E
500|$|When the {{production}} company {{first arrived in}} Los Angeles, {{the cast and crew}} were [...] "intimidated" [...] by Scientologists. Scientology officials had previously visited the New York City production in the midst of rehearsals and handed out [...] "documentation of court cases where the Church of Scientology had successfully prosecuted those seeking to disparage the Church's methods." [...] Director/creator Alex Timbers characterized these events as [...] "terrifically wonderful and intimidating". Editors from the Los Angeles Times received phone calls from Scientologists urging them not to write about the play. [...] In addition, the parents of one of the children from the cast received phone calls from members of the entertainment industry who were Scientologists. The parents of these cast members were told that if their children performed in the play, [...] "it might be bad for their future career." [...] The parents politely informed these callers [...] "We read the script, and we don't think it is mean-spirited ... We understand your concerns, but we don't share your concerns." [...] When asked by Variety magazine for the Church's official take on the play, a Los Angeles Church of Scientology spokeswoman was quoted as saying: [...] "This is not litigation material. This is nothing." [...] In a 2007 interview, Jarrow commented on the Church of Scientology's history of responses to productions of the play: [...] "It's clear the Church doesn't like the show—but in my opinion that kind of controversy is evidence that the show's hitting a nerve and dealing with pertinent issues. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> a certain pride in that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bradley {{contends that}} the Angus have been good to her. In an {{interview}} with screenwriter Anne Rapp, Bradley acknowledged that [...] "Most women don’t want to live out this far. You either love it, or you hate it. I love this old country. It’s the best friend I’ve had for fifty years, and it’s never let me down. It’s taken care of me, this old country. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> care of it.”.|$|E
60|$|That sounded {{perfectly}} reasonable to me, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> {{it up with}} young Lee Rundle at once.|$|R
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> him off, and whisked him on to {{some girls}} I knew {{at one of the}} tables.|$|R
60|$|I {{could see}} he was not at ease, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> his poor old {{wrinkled}} hand in mine and asked him to speak fully.|$|R
2500|$|When she wasn't writing, Allen and {{her husband}} were among the most visible of Manhattan's theater crowd. She would spend her later years as a script doctor and observing {{particularly}} salacious crime trials from the benches in Manhattan Criminal Court. Allen had just about given up writing any more movies from beginning to end, preferring to do lucrative rewrites. It had stopped being fun for her. Script 'development' translated to 'scripts written by committee', but the upside was that [...] "developed" [...] scripts tend to need rewrites – from outside the [...] "development circle"."A production rewrite means that the project is in production. Big money elements – directors, actors – are pay or play. There is a shooting date. The shit is in the fan. And that's where writers like me come in. Writers who are fast and reliable. We are nicely paid to do these production rewrites[...] [...] and we love these jobs. Without credit? Never with credit. If you go for credit on somebody else's work, you have to completely dismantle the structure. Who wants a job where you have to completely dismantle the structure? I only take things that I think are in reasonable shape. The director and the producer and the studio may not necessarily agree with me, but I think the script is in reasonable shape. Besides, no one but the writer ever knows how much trouble any one piece of work will be. Only the writer knows that. Only the writer. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> what looks to me like something that is in good enough shape, yet which I can contribute to and make it worth the pay they are going to give me[...] [...] There are more than one of us out there. These jobs are quick, sometimes they're even fun, and you don't have to take the terrible meetings. They're not breathing on you. They're just desperate to get a script. I've never taken anything that I knew I couldn't help. They pay good money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> no prisoners, {{who seek}} vengeance, not ransom, and {{least of all}} from you. My {{companion}} shall not touch you unless I fall. Swift now, the light dies, and I would kill you fighting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In such a company, {{where only}} the leader enjoys the {{privilege}} of a family name, the like would be unbecoming its least member. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> the name that best becomes in me. And I think it is Parvissimus--the very least." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> my {{stand before}} them, [...] Very silent and erect, [...] My accusing glance passed o'er them, [...] Though with no {{observed}} effect.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought you}} were with mother, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> forty winks after I got those girls off. Now, I'm at your service, Rosamunda, {{whenever}} you like." ...|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} my little joke was over, and I was almost ashamed. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> the typewritten copy from my work basket {{and handed it}} to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, you defend him!" [...] cried Mr. Flint. [...] "I thought so--I thought <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> off my hat to him, he is a cleverer man {{even than}} I. His own father, {{whom he has}} ruined, comes up here and defends him." ...|$|E
60|$|Steph. I understand, being present, from my ambassadors, {{what your}} {{resolution}} is, and ask an hour's time of deliberation, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> our leave; but first I {{desire to be}} entertained at your butt, as becomes a prince and his ambassadors.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{found him}} on some links in the South of France," [...] he answered. [...] "He {{is the only}} caddie I ever knew who could make a decent tee, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> him about with me. He valets me as well. That will do nicely, Dumayne." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My daughter! My little girl," [...] he answered! [...] "And I {{heard her}} calling {{to me with}} her mother's voice across the sea. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> the money." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> the hint, {{and came}} too. I was too excited to sleep, but this diary has quieted me, and I feel I shall {{get some sleep}} tonight.|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{doubt he}} will be here presently. My mother is at the masque. There was not a seat for us, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> him down to St. Andrew's Rock." ...|$|R
6000|$|I've got a swollen ear; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> {{advantage}} of it to lie abed most of the day, and read and smoke and scribble {{and have a good}} time. Last evening Livy said with deep concern, [...] "O dear, I believe an abscess is forming in your ear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We shall {{endeavor}} {{to keep him}} quiet. The cover of the trees, and the berth of the boat, make all snug, as respects his people. I leave worthy Tiller to settle balances between us; and <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> my leave. Master Alderman--a word at parting Does the Viscount Cornbury still tarry in the Provinces?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Caryll {{shifted in}} his chair. One glance he gave the countess, then smiled. [...] "I have sought at your hands the reasons why you should desire my death," [...] said he slowly. [...] "You {{withhold}} them. Be it <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> it that you are ashamed of them; and so, their nature {{is not difficult to}} conjecture." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{thought that}} the longer this went on the wilder he would get, and so would bring on a fit, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> him {{by the hand and}} raised him up.|$|R
6000|$|... "There was a neck of mutton and a chicken. She {{said the}} neck of mutton would keep hot best, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> the chicken. <b>I</b> hope you like lukewarm neck of mutton?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mr Brehgert came to me,' {{continued}} Croll, 'because one signature was wanting. It {{was very}} late, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> them home with me. I said I'd {{bring them to}} you in the morning.' ...|$|R
60|$|Muf. Why, if I {{have been}} a little pilfering, or <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> it bitterly of thee to tell me of it, since it was to make thee rich; and I hope a man may make bold with his own soul, without offence to his own child. Here, take the jewels again; take them, I charge thee, upon thy obedience.|$|E
60|$|I AM {{not used}} to writing for print. What working-man, that never labours less (some Mondays, and Christmas Time and Easter Time excepted) than twelve or {{fourteen}} hours a day, is? But I {{have been asked to}} put down, plain, what I have got to say; and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> pen-and-ink, and do it {{to the best of my}} power, hoping defects will find excuse.|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{father was}} German. He hated this country--yours and mine. He plotted with the I.W.W. He hated {{your father and}} wanted to destroy him.... Before he died he {{realized}} his crime. For <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> the few words he spoke to Jerry. But all the same he was a traitor to my country. I bear his name. I have German in me.... And by God I'm going to pay!" ...|$|E
60|$|The bull charged on me with fury. As he did <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> the spade {{and held}} it on a level with my waist, resting the butt end {{on the wall behind}} me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, yes, it was I. The fellow insulted a young comrade in my regiment, knowing {{well that}} he could not shoot; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> it up, and there was an end of it." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I helped Gene 'southernize' the libretto. Gene's from New York, and he wasn't {{sure how}} to shape the {{language}} for the characters, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> care of it. Those speech patterns felt very familiar." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, I see!" [...] the Warden muttered, glancing {{carelessly}} through them. [...] "Order countermanded by my brother, and {{supposed to}} be my doing! Rather sharp practice! It's all right!" [...] he added in a louder tone. [...] "My name is signed to it: <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> it on myself. But what do they mean by 'Less Taxes'? How can they be less? I abolished the last of them a month ago!" ...|$|E
6000|$|With doubt I {{submitted}} {{to you this}} story, asking whether you wished to accept pages that could not, I feared, be free from error, and with surprise in due course I read, among other kind things, your advice to me to [...] "leave it exactly as it is."

6000|$|... "Alas!" [...] {{cried out}} Sir Tristram, [...] "I would that I had known {{who you were}} ere I did battle with you. For I have greater love for the knights of the Round Table than all others in the world, and most of all, Sir Ector, do I have reverence for your noble brother Sir Launcelot of the Lake. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>take</b> great shame to myself that any mishap should have befallen you this day through me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{chloroform}} {{took effect}} very quickly. Her husband had some difficulty in forcing the mouth open. When {{he had once}} done <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> a firm hold of the tooth, and wrenched it out.|$|R
60|$|Estella told me we {{were both}} to go in, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> Joe by the coat-cuff and {{conducted}} him into Miss Havisham's presence. She was seated at her dressing-table, and looked round at us immediately.|$|R
6000|$|One {{time the}} {{trembling}} of this poor lip {{was so strong}} and her tears ran down <b>so</b> fast that <b>I</b> {{thought she was going}} to tell me all her woe, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>takes</b> her two hands in mine and I says: ...|$|R
