40|$|<b>Synovial</b> <b>sarcomas</b> {{comprise}} approximately 5 % of {{soft tissue}} sarcomas and occur primarily in young adults. The t(X; 18) (p 11. 2;q 11. 2) {{has been demonstrated}} to be highly characteristic of <b>synovial</b> <b>sarcomas,</b> and the resulting SYT-SSX fusion transcripts {{have been shown to}} be useful diagnostic markers. We have developed a real-time, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) multiplex assay for the identification of the primary fusion transcript types (SYT-SSX 1 and SYT-SSX 2) from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. Twenty-nine of 30 (96. 7 %) histologically diagnosed FFPE <b>synovial</b> <b>sarcomas</b> were positive for the presence of either the SYT-SSX 1 or SYT-SSX 2 fusion transcripts. Ten of 16 (62. 5 %) and five of 16 (31. 25 %) monophasic fibrous <b>synovial</b> <b>sarcomas</b> were positive for SYT-SSX 1 and SYT-SSX 2, respectively. One of 16 (6. 25 %) monophasic fibrous <b>synovial</b> <b>sarcomas</b> was negative for either SYT-SSX fusion transcript.

40|$|Purpose. To {{determine}} {{the incidence of}} intra-articular <b>synovial</b> <b>sarcomas</b> and investigate if any radiological variables can differentiate them from localized (unifocal) pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) and if multivariate data analysis {{could be used as}} a complementary clinical tool. Methods. Magnetic resonance images and radiographs of 7 cases of intra-articular <b>synovial</b> <b>sarcomas</b> and 14 cases of localized PVNS were blindedly reviewed. Variables analyzed were size, extra-articular growth, tumor border, blooming, calcification, contrast media enhancement, effusion, bowl of grapes sign, triple signal intensity sign, synovial low signal intensity, synovitis, age, and gender. Univariate and multivariate data analysis, the method of partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), were used. Register data on all <b>synovial</b> <b>sarcomas</b> were extracted for comparison. Results. The incidence of intra-articular <b>synovial</b> <b>sarcomas</b> was 3 %. PLS-DA showed that age, effusion, size, and gender were the most important factors for discrimination between sarcomas and localized PVNS. No sarcomas were misclassified as PVNS with PLS-DA, while some PVNS were misclassified as sarcomas. Conclusions. The most important variables in differentiating intra-articular sarcomas from localized PVNS were age, effusion, size, and gender. Multivariate data analysis can be helpful as additive information to avoid a biopsy, if the tumor is classified as most likely being PVNS...|$|R

Using whole-genome DNA microarrays, we defined the gene expression profiles of 16 SFT/HPC (9 HPC and 7 SFT). Expression profiles were compared to publicly available expression profiles of additional SFT or HPC, meningiomas and <b>synovial</b> <b>sarcomas.</b> We also performed an immunohistochemical (IHC) study with anti-ALDH 1 and anti-CD 34 antibodies on Tissue Micro-Arrays including 38 SFT (25 meningeal and 13 extrameningeal), 55 meningeal haemangiopericytomas (24 grade II, 31 grade III), 163 meningiomas (86 grade I, 62 grade II, 15 grade III) and 98 genetically confirmed <b>synovial</b> <b>sarcomas.</b> Results ALDH 1 A 1 gene was overexpressed in SFT/HPC, as compared to meningiomas and <b>synovial</b> <b>sarcomas.</b> These findings were confirmed at the protein level. 84 % of the SFT and 85. 4 % of the HPC were positive with anti-ALDH 1 antibody, while only 7. 1 % of <b>synovial</b> <b>sarcomas</b> and 1. 2 % of meningiomas showed consistent expression. Positivity was usually more diffuse in SFT/HPC compared to other tumours with more than 50 % of tumour cells immunostained in 32 % of SFT and 50. 8 % of HPC. ALDH 1 was a sensitive and specific marker for the diagnosis of SFT (SE[*]=[*] 84 %, SP[*]=[*] 98. 8 %) and HPC (SE[*]=[*] 84. 5 %, SP[*]=[*] 98. 7 %) of the meninges. In association with CD 34, ALDH 1 expression had a specificity and positive predictive value of 100 %. Conclusion We show that ALDH 1, a stem cell marker, is an accurate diagnostic marker for SFT and HPC, which improves the diagnostic value of CD 34. ALDH 1 could also be a new therapeutic target for these tumours which are not sensitive to conventional chemotherapy...|$|R
40|$|Cytogenetic {{study of}} five biphasic and five {{monophasic}} <b>synovial</b> <b>sarcomas</b> revealed the specific abnormality t(X; 18) (p 11;q 11) in eight cases and t(X; 15; 18) (p 11;q 15;q 111) and t(X; 7) (q 11 – 12;q 32) {{in one case}} each. Additional, secondary aberrations were present in eight of these tumors. By combining our data with information on previously published cytogenetically abnormal <b>synovial</b> <b>sarcomas,</b> {{we were able to}} evaluate 32 tumor samples from 29 patients. The modal chromosome number was pseudodiploid or near diploid in 26 of the 32 tumors. A t(X; 18) was present in 21 of 29 cases (72 %). Complex translocations involving chromosomes X and 18 and another autosome were present in five cases, and one displayed a t(5; 18). There was no visible rearrangement of chromosome bands Xp 11 or 18 q 11 in only 2 of the 32 <b>synovial</b> <b>sarcomas.</b> Half of the primary tumors (6 of 12) had the X; 18 ‐translocation as the sole abnormality. Of the remaining 20 specimens from recurrent or metastatic tumors (in three cases two tumors could be analyzed), only one had t(X; 18) as the sole change. The secondary aberrations in cases exhibiting clonal evolution were also generally more extensive in the metastatic and recurrent than in the primary sarcomas (five additional aberrations per case, compared with two). Chromosomes 1 and 12 were the chromosomes most frequently (one fourth of the cases) involved in additional structural changes, but with several different breakpoints.

40|$|There {{are more}} than 50 subtypes of soft tissue sarcomas, among which 30 % are {{associated}} with specific genetic alterations, including translocations. Several studies have reported associations between cancer risk and polymorphisms of DNA repair genes from the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway. NER involves more than 20 proteins whose inactivation leads to xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) or cockayne syndrome (CS), among which XPD, a helicase allowing DNA strand excision by the endonuclease XPG. DNA from 93 patients with <b>synovial</b> <b>sarcomas,</b> myxoid liposarcomas, dermatofibrosarcomas protuberans (DFSP), malignant fibrous histiocytomas and leiomyosarcomas were genotyped for both XPD Lys 751 Gln and XPG Asp 1104 His polymorphisms. Departure from Hardy-Weinberg was highly significant for the XPG polymorphism with an excess of heterozygotes in <b>synovial</b> <b>sarcomas</b> (p = 1. 5 x 10 (- 5)), myxoid liposarcomas (p = 1. 5 x 10 (- 4)) {{and to a lesser}} extent in DFSP (p = 0. 028). In the case of XPD, a significant deviation was observed in <b>synovial</b> <b>sarcomas</b> (p = 3 x 10 (- 6)) and DFSP (p = 0. 0014). When tumors were pooled according to their genetic alterations, the proportion of carriers of the variant XPG allele was significantly increased in sarcomas with specific translocations as compared to sarcomas with complex genetics (p < 10 (- 9)). No difference was found for XPD. Genotyping of the tumor samples in <b>synovial</b> <b>sarcomas</b> and myxoid liposarcomas revealed frequent loss of heterozygosity for XPG, mostly due to the loss of the frequent allele. For XPD, both alleles were lost with a similar frequency. Our results raise the potential implication of the XPG Asp 1104 His polymorphism in the occurrence of chromosomal translocations associated with specific subtypes of sarcomas...|$|R

As these results were obtained by different groups, we set out to evaluate an extended series of tumors with special emphasis on the two possible X-related breakpoint regions. Together, seven <b>synovial</b> <b>sarcomas</b> were identified with a break in the OATL 1 region and six with a break near OATL 2, thereby confirming the actual existence of the two alternative Xp breakpoint regions.

40|$|PURPOSE: Peptide receptors are {{frequently}} overexpressed in human tumors, allowing receptor-targeted scintigraphic imaging and therapy with radiolabeled peptide analogues. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptors are new candidates for these applications, {{based on their}} high expression in specific cancers. Because NPY receptors are expressed in selected sarcoma cell lines and because novel treatment options are needed for sarcomas, this study assessed the NPY receptor in primary human sarcomas. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Tumor tissues of 88 cases, including Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT), <b>synovial</b> <b>sarcomas,</b> osteosarcomas, chondrosarcomas, liposarcomas, angiosarcomas, rhabdomyosarcomas, leiomyosarcomas, and desmoid tumors, were investigated for NPY receptor protein with in vitro receptor autoradiography using (125) I-labeled NPY receptor ligands and for NPY receptor mRNA expression with in situ hybridization. RESULTS: ESFT expressed the NPY receptor subtype Y 1 on tumor cells in remarkably high incidence (84 %) and density (mean, 5, 314 dpm/mg tissue). Likewise, <b>synovial</b> <b>sarcomas</b> expressed Y 1 on tumor cells in high density (mean, 7, 497 dpm/mg; incidence, 40 %). The remaining tumors expressed NPY receptor subtypes Y 1 or Y 2 at lower levels. Moreover, many of the sarcomas showed Y 1 expression on intratumoral blood vessels. In situ hybridization for Y 1 mRNA confirmed the autoradiography results. CONCLUSIONS: NPY receptors are novel molecular markers for human sarcomas. Y 1 may inhibit growth of specific sarcomas, as previously shown in an in vivo mouse model of human ESFT. The high Y 1 expression on tumor cells of ESFT and <b>synovial</b> <b>sarcomas</b> and on blood vessels in many other sarcomas represents an attractive basis for an in vivo tumor targeting...|$|R

These epithelioid cytokeratin positive cells raise the possibility of metastatic disease with prognostic and therapeutic implications differing from primary osteosarcoma. The cytokeratin-expressing cells of the cases reported in the literature have not shown definitive squamous differentiation with keratin pearl formation.

Case Presentation: A 46 -year-old Pakistani man presented with a 2 month history of progressively increasing cough and left lower chest pain. Initial evaluation was done using a chest x-ray, the Patient {{was found to have}} a large mass involving the lower portion of the left chest. A computed tomography scan was performed next which showed a large mass involving the left chest wall with invasion into the pericardium and left hemidiaphragm. En bloc surgical resection of the tumor was undertaken. Final pathology showed <b>synovial</b> cell <b>sarcoma</b> of the thorax. At one-year follow-up, the Patient has shown no recurrence of the disease. Conclusions: We have described a rare case of a large <b>synovial</b> cell <b>sarcoma</b> of the thorax.

50|$|The {{diagnosis}} of <b>synovial</b> <b>sarcoma</b> is typically made based on histology and {{is confirmed by}} the presence of t(X;18). This translocation event between the SS18 gene on chromosome 18 and one of 3 SSX genes (SSX1, SSX2 and SSX4) on chromosome X causes the presence of a SS18-SSX fusion gene. The resulting fusion protein brings together the transcriptional activating domain of SS18 and the transcriptional repressor domains of SSX. It also incorporates into the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, a well known tumor suppressor. SS18-SSX is thought to underlie <b>synovial</b> <b>sarcoma</b> pathogenesis through dysregulation of gene expression.|$|E
40|$|A high {{proportion}} of <b>synovial</b> <b>sarcomas</b> contain the reciprocal translocation t(X; 18) (p 11. 2;q 11. 2). We have previously localized the breakpoint on the X chromosome between the X chromosome marker DXS 255 and an ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) pseudogene region designated OATL 2. Subsequently by {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) we provided evidence that YACs corresponding to the OATL 2 locus spanned the break-point. In order to confirm the position of this breakpoint cosmids corresponding to the OATL 2 region were isolated. Most of these cosmids mapped to four cosmid contigs designated C 1 -C 4. Analysis of two contigs, C 1 - and C 4, using FISH established that in four of six <b>synovial</b> <b>sarcomas</b> examined the breakpoint occurs between these two contigs: C 1 lies distal to the break-point while C 4 is proximal. In contrast we provide evidence that the breakpoint in the remaining two tumours mapped to a second pseudogene region called OATL 1 that is telomeric to the OATL 2 locus. This heterogeneity of the breakpoint position on the X chromosome explains why in previous mapping studies there have been discrepancies between the results obtained by different laboratories...|$|R
