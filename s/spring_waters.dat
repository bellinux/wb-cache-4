Seven large rock tubs discovered by archeologists {{dating back to}} the beginning of the 7th century attest to the availability and use of the <b>spring</b> <b>waters,</b> most likely for bathing purposes.

The town itself was founded in the 11th century when Benedictine monks established a priory {{at the foot of the}} highest peak of Malvern Hills. During the 19th century Malvern developed rapidly from a village to a sprawling conurbation owing to its popularity as a hydrotherapy spa based on its <b>spring</b> <b>waters.</b> Immediately following the decline of spa tourism towards the end of the 19th century, the town's focus shifted to education with the establishment of several private boarding schools in former hotels and large villas. A further major expansion was the result of the relocation of the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) to Malvern in 1942. QinetiQ, TRE's successor company, remains the town's largest local employer.|$|E

5|$|William McEwan {{opened the}} Fountain Brewery in Fountainbridge, then a suburb on the {{outskirts}} of Edinburgh, in 1856, using £2,000 loaned by his mother and his uncle. The area and the brewery are named after the <b>spring</b> <b>waters</b> from the vicinity, which, in addition to its proximity to the Caledonian railway line and the Union Canal, determined the location of the brewery. McEwan had employed geologists to identify the prime location for a supply of well water. Beforehand, McEwan had engaged in industrial espionage at Bass and Allsopp's breweries in order to learn techniques and assay costs. After establishing a market share in the industrial regions of the Scottish lowlands, from the early 1860s McEwan built up a successful colonial export trade by exploiting his family's shipowning connections. It was during this time that McEwan's India Pale Ale, the beer that was the foundation for much of the company's reputation, was first labelled Export.|$|E

The author examined the effect of the drinking of Kaike <b>spring</b> <b>water</b> on gastric acidity in 21 patients. a) Two hundred m!. of this <b>spring</b> <b>water</b> were given to 10 patients by stomach tube at 37 ℃. The gastric acidity of the patients was measured at 30 -minute intervals for a period of 105 minutes following the administration of the <b>spring</b> <b>water.</b> In 3 cases of normal acidity and 6 cases of hyperacidiy, the <b>spring</b> <b>water</b> appeared to inhibit the secretion of gastric acid, compared with the effect of the caffein control water. b) Two hundred m!. of the <b>spring</b> <b>water</b> diluted two-fold with tap water were given to 11 patients. In two cases of normal acidity and two cases of hypoacidity, on significant difference was observed between the effects of the <b>spring</b> <b>water</b> and those of the control water.

The River Chess is a chalk-stream which rises from three springs; to the north-west along the Pednor Vale at Frogmoor, at Higham Mead to the north of the town, and to the west near the Amersham Road which converge in the town near to East Street. The river was known as the Isen from at least 12th century when it is found contributing to the name to the nearby hamlet of Isenhampstead, later to divide and become the manors of Isenhampstead Chenies and Isenhampstead Latimer and persisting until the 19th century. It has been suggested, but not established, that the old name 'Isen', which derives from the Anglo-Saxon word for iron, refers to the chalybeate or iron-charged <b>spring</b> <b>waters</b> which feed the river Today the streams are culverted and conducted below street level before emerging at Waterside and flowing in a south easterly direction towards Latimer.
