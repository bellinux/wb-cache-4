(1) the Commission {{has been}} {{notified}} by the Secretary of State {{that it is}} the judgment of the executive branch that the proposed export or exemption will not be inimical to the common defense and security, or that any export in the category to which the proposed export belongs would not be inimical to the common defense and security because it lacks significance for nuclear explosive purposes. The Secretary of State shall, within ninety days after the enactment of this section, establish orderly and expeditious procedures, including provision for necessary administrative actions and inter-agency memorandum of understanding, which are mutually agreeable to the Secretaries of Energy, Defense, and Commerce, the Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the preparation of the executive branch judgment on export applications under this section. <b>Such</b> <b>procedures</b> <b>shall</b> <b>include,</b> at a minimum, explicit direction on the handling of such applications, express deadlines for the solicitation and collection of the views of the consulted agencies (with identified officials responsible for meeting such deadlines), an inter-agency coordinating authority to monitor the processing of such applications, predetermined procedures for the expeditious handling of intra-agency and inter-agency disagreements and appeals to higher authorities, frequent meetings of inter-agency administrative coordinators to review the status of all pending applications, and similar administrative mechanisms. To the extent practicable, an applicant should be advised of all the information required of the applicant for the entire process for every agency's needs {{at the beginning of the}} process. Potentially controversial applications should be identified as quickly as possible so that any required policy decisions or diplomatic consultations can be initiated in a timely manner. An immediate effort should be undertaken to establish quickly any necessary standards and criteria, including the nature of any required assurances or evidentiary showings, for the decisions required under this section. The processing of any export application proposed and filed as of the date of enactment of this section shall not be delayed pending the development and establishment of procedures to implement the requirements of this section. The executive branch judgment shall be completed in not more than sixty days from receipt of the application or request, unless the Secretary of State in his discretion specifically authorizes additional time for consideration of the application or request because it is in the national interest to allow such additional time. The Secretary shall notify the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on International Relations of the House of Representatives of any such authorization. In submitting any such judgment, the Secretary of State shall specifically address the extent to which the export criteria then in effect are met and the extent to which the cooperating party has adhered to the provisions of the applicable agreement for cooperation. In the event he considers it warranted, the Secretary may also address the following additional factors, among others : ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Stochastic {{measurement}} procedures {{have been proposed}} and developed in several articles published in EQC. In contrast to the traditional {{measurement procedures}} that use the obsolete error propagation formula for taking into account measurement uncertainty, stochastic measurement procedures include the entire uncertainty of the measurement process in a natural and rational way. In this paper the concept of stochastic measurement procedure is extended to {{the case that the}} measurement process is given by a stochastic process or more precisely said by a time series. This case appears often for economic phenomena. In this paper, only the feasibility of <b>such</b> measurement <b>procedures</b> <b>shall</b> be demonstrated and the considerations are therefore restricted to some simple and rather unrealistic examples. In a realistic case an appropriate stochastic model must be developed following the rules of stochastic modelling. ...|$|R

A. 26 : 3 D- 17, the Cherry Hill Board of Education believes it should discourage young people from using tobacco products. Therefore, for students, visitors, volunteers and staff, the Board of Education prohibits the use of cigarettes, cigars, pipes, chewing tobacco, smokeless tobacco, snuff, or any tobacco related product and/or paraphernalia, this also includes the use of electronic cigarettes and other electronic smoking devices, at any time in school buildings or on school grounds.
