40|$|THE TRADITIONAL TOOL of {{monetary}} policy {{is an open}} market operation, in which the Federal Reserve purchases short-term Treasury securities from the public. The Fed pays for these purchases by crediting the deposits that the selling bank holds in an account with the Fed.

The primary goal of open market operations was understood to be to control the available <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>reserve</b> deposits and the money supply in order to achieve policy targets for the short-term interest rate and inflation. If the Fed wanted to increase the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>reserve</b> deposits on a strictly temporary basis, it would traditionally do so with a repurchase agreement (repo), acquiring an asset from the counterparty and crediting the counterparty’s Fed balance with newly created deposits, with an explicit agreement to return the asset and receive the deposits plus interest back at a 68 THE FED’S ENTRY AND EXIT STRATEGIES specified future date.

40|$|It is {{important}} to understand how the central bank manages the monetary operation when studying the effect of monetary policy. But the researchers of economics and the officials of the Bank of Japan do not agree on how to manage the monetary operation, especially on whether or not the monetary authority should regulate the high-powered money, that is, the cash and the reserve. The former insists that the central bank should regulate the high-powered money in order to control the total money supply. The latter insists that the central bank should not regulate the high-powered money and ought to make use <b>of</b> the lagged <b>reserve</b> requirement system to control the short-term interest rate by adjusting the speed at which the private bank accumulates the required <b>reserve.</b> The aim <b>of</b> this paper is to examine whether the central bank can control the short-term interest rate as the officials of BOJ insist. To this aim, the model is constructed as the game played between the central bank and the private bank. This model is an extended version based on Mori(1998). The assumptions of the model are the following. The private bank has to accumulate the required reserve during three periods. The private bank decides how much reserve she holds at each period, so as to minimize the cost of holding it. The central bank has the target interest rate, the selected value of which the private bank does not know, and supplies the reserve at each period, the sum of which must be equal to the required one. But at each period except the last one, the central bank can decide how much reserve she supplies in order to realize the target interest rate. In the analysis of this paper, attention is paid to the way the private bank expects the value of the target rate of the central bank. So three cases are examined in terms of how the private bank expects it. The first is that the private bank expects the value of the target rate using all available information such as the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>reserve</b> and the interest rate of the last period. The second case is that she does not use such information. The last {{is in the middle of}} these cases, that is, she expects the target rate value using only the current <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>reserve.</b> The results are the following. The central bank can control the short-term interest rate by adjusting the speed at which the private bank accumulates the required reserve whenever the latter expects the target rate using at least the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>reserve</b> among the available information including the interest rate of the last period...|$|R
40|$|Effectiveness {{of actual}} {{monetary}} policy {{depends on the}} ability of central banks to stabilize the fluctuations of overnight interest rates around their official policy rate.

40|$|Many {{central banks}} {{implement}} monetary policy {{in a way}} that maintains a tight link between the stock of money and the short-term interest rate. In particular, their implementation procedures require that the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>reserve</b> balances be set precisely in order to implement the target interest rate. Because bank reserves play other key roles in the economy, this link can create tensions with other important objectives, especially in times of acute market stress. This article considers an alternative approach to monetary policy implementation [...] known as a "floor system" [...] that can reduce or even eliminate these tensions. The authors explain how this approach, in which the central bank pays interest on reserves at the target interest rate, "divorces" the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> money from the conduct of monetary policy. The quantity <b>of</b> bank <b>reserves</b> can then be set according to the payment or liquidity needs of financial markets.

40|$|While the {{mainstream}} long {{argued that the}} central bank could use quantitative constraints {{as a means to}} controlling the private creation of money, most economists now recognize that the central bank can only set the overnight interest rate-which has only an indirect impact on the quantity of reserves and the quantity of privately created money. Indeed, in order to hit the overnight rate target, the central bank must accommodate the demand for reserves, draining the excess or supplying reserves when the system is short. Thus, the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>reserves</b> is best characterized as horizontal, at the central bank's target rate. Because reserves pay relatively low rates, or even zero rates (as in the United States), banks try to minimize their holdings. Over time, they continually innovate, as they seek to minimize costs and increase profits. This includes innovations that reduce the quantity of reserves they need to hold (either to satisfy legal requirements, or {{to meet the needs of}} check cashing and clearing), and also innovations that allow them to increase the rate of return on equity within regulatory constraints, such as those associated with Basle agreements.

40|$|The {{consequences}} of electronic trading, {{payment and settlement}} have recently {{become one of the}} main topics in monetary economics. New innovations in payment and settlement technology are challenging the central bank’s monopoly over the supply of base money, which is generally considered the cornerstone of the central bank’s power to set the short-term interest rate for the economy. This paper demonstrates that the development of the economy’s transaction technology over time has indeed had a significant quantitative impact on the demand for currency and bank reserves, and indirectly on the modalities of the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>reserves</b> by the central bank. In contrast to past trends, the latest innovations in payment and settlement technology imply not only a quantitative change but also a qualitative one, as they enable private institutions to issue settlement money that competes with the liabilities of the central bank. The paper presents a model on the implementation of monetary policy in an economy where such private substitutes for central bank money are available for the settlement of transactions, showing that effective monetary control by the central bank might indeed be compromised in those circumstances. However, the study also highlights several attributes that may distinguish central bank liabilities from any private alternatives, some of which are based on the central bank’s traditional role as the banker for the Government. monetary policy; reserve demand; payment systems; financial innovation...|$|E
