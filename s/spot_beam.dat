25|$|During {{in-orbit}} {{testing of}} the satellite, {{it was discovered that}} the New Zealand <b>spot</b> <b>beam</b> had been configured with horizontal polarisation instead of the expected vertical polarisation - as had been used on its predecessor Optus B1.|$|E
2500|$|On 2007-07-31, Sky {{successfully}} {{performed an}} {{over the air}} software upgrade to all of its customer set-top boxes, enabling them to receive the horizontally-aligned signals from the New Zealand <b>spot</b> <b>beam.</b> [...] Accordingly, Sky was {{able to return to}} their original capacity allocation.|$|E
50|$|The {{satellite}} {{also had}} two Ku-band steerable <b>spot</b> <b>beams</b> {{which could be}} moved to cover any specific area on the earth, and could be re-pointed as needed. The Ku-band <b>spot</b> <b>beams</b> provide both receive and transmit capability.|$|R

50|$|In {{the case}} of Intelsat 35e, the C-band side has EpicNG <b>spot</b> <b>beams</b> with a total {{downlink}} bandwidth of 4,356 MHz. The <b>spot</b> <b>beams</b> offer high bandwidth for Europe, Sub-Sahara Africa, and the Americas. The Ku band has 39 transponder equivalents for a total downlink bandwidth of 1,404 MHz. Of the Ku three wide beams, one is covering the Caribbean, another Europe and the Mediterranean, and the third beams cover Europe and Northern Africa.|$|R
2500|$|As many {{existing}} receivers did {{not have}} the ability to receive horizontally aligned signals, Sky Television was unable to transfer services from Optus B1 to this beam as expected. [...] Sky was instead assigned capacity on the more general Australia/NZ beam. [...] Due to restrictions on broadcast rights (in terms of both broadcast licensing and copyright), the unencrypted Freeview service could not make a similar allocation switch and was set up as a horizontally-aligned service on the New Zealand <b>spot</b> <b>beam.</b>|$|E

50|$|On December 26, 2010, Eutelsat's KA-SAT was launched. It {{covers the}} European {{continent}} with 80 spot beams—focused signals that cover an area {{a few hundred}} kilometers across Europe and the Mediterranean. <b>Spot</b> <b>beams</b> allow for frequencies to be effectively reused in multiple regions without interference. The result is increased capacity. Each of the <b>spot</b> <b>beams</b> has an overall capacity of 900 Mbit/s and the entire satellite will has a capacity of 70 Gbit/s.|$|R
50|$|Each of the {{satellites}} has three downlink <b>spot</b> <b>beams,</b> with each beam covering approximately 14 million square kilometers of the Earth.|$|R
50|$|Its 20 Ku band transponders are {{connected}} to four <b>spot</b> <b>beams</b> over Europe and Turkey. These four beams overlap to allow hubs located in the hot <b>spots</b> of each <b>beam</b> {{to communicate with each}} other, thus ensuring highly effective pan-European coverage.|$|R

50|$|Fibersat 1 is a Ka-band High Throughput Satellite (HTS) with {{multiple}} <b>spot</b> <b>beams</b> across Africa and the Middle East. The target launch date is Q3, 2018.|$|R
50|$|Narrow beams {{are offered}} by the three Inmarsat-4 satellites. Narrow beams vary in size, tend to be several hundred {{kilometers}} across. The narrow beams, while {{much smaller than the}} global or regional beams, are far more numerous and hence offer the same global coverage. Narrow <b>spot</b> <b>beams</b> allow yet smaller antennas and much higher data rates. They form the backbone of Inmarsat's handheld (GSPS) and broadband services (BGAN). This coverage was introduced with the I-4 satellites. Each I-4 satellite provides around 200 narrow <b>spot</b> <b>beams.</b>|$|R
5000|$|M-code signal at Earth's surface: -158 dBW for whole Earth antenna, -138 dBW for <b>spot</b> <b>beam</b> antennas.|$|E
50|$|In a major {{departure}} from previous GPS designs, the M-code {{is intended to}} be broadcast from a high-gain directional antenna, in addition to a full-Earth antenna. This directional antenna's signal, called a <b>spot</b> <b>beam,</b> {{is intended to be}} aimed at a specific region (several hundred kilometers in diameter) and increase the local signal strength by 20 dB, or approximately 100 times stronger. A side effect of having two antennas is that the GPS satellite will appear to be two GPS satellites occupying the same position to those inside the <b>spot</b> <b>beam.</b> While the whole Earth M-code signal is available on the Block IIR-M satellites, the <b>spot</b> <b>beam</b> antennas will not be deployed until the Block III satellites are deployed, tentatively in 2018.|$|E

50|$|SeaWinds uses a {{rotating}} dish antenna with two <b>spot</b> <b>beams</b> that sweep {{in a circular}} pattern. The antenna consists of a 1-meter diameter rotating dish that produces two <b>spot</b> <b>beams,</b> sweeping in a circular pattern. It radiates 110 W microwave pulses at a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of 189 Hz. QuikSCAT operates at a frequency of 13.4 GHz, {{which is in the}} Ku-band of microwave frequencies. At this frequency, the atmosphere is mostly transparent to non-precipitating clouds and aerosols, although rain produces significant alteration of the signal.|$|R
5000|$|Each Sky Muster has 101 <b>spot</b> <b>beams,</b> {{which are}} focused {{satellite}} signals which are specially concentrated {{in power and}} cover a specific geographic area. The electromagnetic Ka band <b>spot</b> <b>beams</b> are used to carry information from the end users equipment {{on the ground to}} the satellites. Each satellite offers 80 gigabits per second of bandwidth. The two satellites will provide high-speed broadband service to 400,000 Australian homes and businesses in rural and remote Australia. The two satellites were designed to provide service for at least 15 years.|$|R

50|$|The {{satellite}} {{option is}} a narrow-band satellite {{operating in the}} Ka band {{as opposed to the}} normal DTH Ku band (which Sky and Freesat use), with a <b>spot</b> <b>beam</b> being dedicated exclusively to Ireland which will also provide coverage throughout Northern Ireland. The <b>spot</b> <b>beam</b> with frequency reuse means reception in most of Britain and continental Europe is not possible. RTÉ states that the chosen satellite option will cost approximately €1.5 million per year.|$|E

40|$|Multi-spot-beam {{technique}} {{has been widely}} applied in modern satellite communication systems. However, the satellite power and bandwidth resources in a multi-spot-beam satellite communication system are scarce and expensive; it is urgent to utilize the resources efficiently. To this end, dynamically allocating the power and bandwidth is an available way. This paper initially formulates the problem of resource joint allocation as a convex optimization problem, taking into account a compromise between the maximum total system capacity and the fairness among the <b>spot</b> <b>beams.</b> A joint bandwidth and power allocation iterative algorithm based on duality theory is then proposed to obtain the optimal solution of this optimization problem. Compared with the existing separate bandwidth or power optimal allocation algorithms, it is shown that the joint allocation algorithm improves both the total system capacity and the fairness among <b>spot</b> <b>beams.</b> Moreover, {{it is easy to}} be implemented in practice, as the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is linear with the number of <b>spot</b> <b>beams...</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of Intelsat 33e, the C band side has 20 transponders with a total {{downlink}} bandwidth of 2,670 MHz. The <b>spot</b> <b>beams</b> offer high bandwidth for Europe, Central Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Australia, and a wide beam covers sub-Saharan Africa. The Ku band has 249 transponder equivalent for a total downlink bandwidth of 9,194 MHz. The Ku <b>spot</b> <b>beams</b> cover Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia, while a wide beam can broadcast to Europe, Middle East and Asia. The Ka band payload has 450 MHz of bandwidth on a global beam centered at its position.|$|R
50|$|After a {{technical}} analysis, including {{an assessment of}} customer power requirements, Facebook and Eutelsat concluded that only 18 out of the 36 Ka-band <b>spot</b> <b>beams</b> could be used simultaneously without sacrificing user experience.|$|R

5000|$|A {{fundamental}} difference between HTS satellites {{is the fact that}} certain HTS are linked to ground infrastructure through a feeder link using a regional <b>spot</b> <b>beam</b> dictating the location of possible teleports while other HTS satellites allow the use of any <b>spot</b> <b>beam</b> for the location of the teleports. In the latter case, the teleports can be set up in a wider area as their spotbeams' footprints cover entire continents and regions like it is the case for traditional satellites [...]|$|E
50|$|At this position, Astra 2F also {{provides}} capacity on a <b>spot</b> <b>beam</b> deployed on West Africa, and Astra 2E provides a beam across the Middle East.|$|E
50|$|Its {{design was}} to provide {{coverage}} to many parts of Africa on C-band and Ku-band, a global navigation beam on L-band and the Ka-band transponders with <b>spot</b> <b>beams</b> over Nigeria, South Africa and Europe.|$|R
30|$|Current {{satellite}} systems, {{following the}} cellular paradigm, employ multiple antennas (i.e., multiple onboard antenna feeds) {{to divide the}} coverage area into small beams (spotbeams). To the end of limiting interbeam interferences, these multibeam satellite communication (SatCom) systems spatially separate beams that share the same bandwidth. This multibeam architecture allows for a significant boost in capacity by reusing the available spectrum several times within the coverage area, especially in the Ka-band. Subsequently, the capacity of current satellite systems can well exceed 100 GBps with state-of-the-art architectures [1]. A large number of recent satellite systems procurements have clearly confirmed the trend towards multibeam satellite systems as broadband reference system architecture. Examples include systems such as Wildblue- 1 and Anik F 2 (66 Ka-band <b>spot</b> <b>beams),</b> Kasat (82 Ka-band <b>spot</b> <b>beams)</b> and recently Viasat- 1 (72 <b>spot</b> <b>beams</b> in Ka-band) for mainly fixed two-way (i.e., interactive) broadband applications {{as well as the}} GlobalExpress system designed {{for a new generation of}} mobile services in Ka-band. Interactive services, in particular, benefit from these architectures since a finer partitioning of the coverage area allows for parallel data stream transmissions.|$|R
