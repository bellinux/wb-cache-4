Often the cap <b>swings</b> <b>open</b> {{when most of the}} cut is made, so as to appear like a hinged lid.|$|E
500|$|The lunge-feeders are the rorquals. To feed, lunge-feeders {{expand the}} volume of their jaw to a volume bigger than the {{original}} volume of the whale itself; to do this, the mouth inflates to expand the mouth. The inflation of the mouth causes the throat pleats to expand, {{increasing the amount of}} water that the mouth can store. Just before they ram the baitball, the jaw <b>swings</b> <b>open</b> at almost a 90Â° angle and bends which lets in more water. To prevent stretching the mouth too far, rorquals have a sensory organ located {{in the middle of the}} jaw to regulate these functions. Then they must decelerate. This process takes a lot of mechanical work, and is only energy-effective when used against a large baitball. The skim-feeders, are right whales, gray whales, pygmy right whales, and sei whales (which also lunge feed). To feed, skim-feeders swim with an open mouth, filling it with water and prey. Prey must occur in sufficient numbers to trigger the whale's interest, be within a certain size range so that the baleen plates can filter it, and be slow enough so that it cannot escape. The [...] "skimming" [...] may take place on the surface, underwater, or even at the ocean's bottom, indicated by mud occasionally observed on right whales' bodies. Gray whales feed primarily on the ocean's bottom, feeding on benthic creatures.|$|E

2500|$|A {{model for}} this is the hinges on a door. When the door is shut, the hinges are flush against the wall. As the door <b>swings</b> <b>open,</b> one side of the door remains pressed against the wall as space opens up on the other side. Removing just a small wedge of bone can [...] "swing" [...] the knee open, {{pressing}} the healthy tissue together as space opens up between the femur and tibia on the damaged side so that the arthritic surfaces do not rub against each other.|$|E
60|$|It is {{difficult}} to wash in these little places, because the cars shake so; {{and when you have}} got both your hands and half your head in the basin, and are unable to protect yourself, the sides of the room, and the water-tap and the soap-dish, and other cowardly things, take a mean advantage of your helplessness to punch you as hard as ever they can; and when you back away from these, the door <b>swings</b> <b>open</b> and slaps you from behind.|$|E
6000|$|Drumcliff and Rosses were, are, {{and ever}} shall be, please Heaven! places of unearthly resort.

Drumcliff {{is a wide}} green valley, lying {{at the foot of}} Ben Bulben, the mountain in whose side the square white door <b>swings</b> <b>open</b> at nightfall to loose the faery riders on the world. The great St. Columba himself, the builder of many of the old ruins in the valley, climbed the mountains on one notable day to get near heaven with his prayers. Rosses is a little sea-dividing, sandy plain, covered with short grass, like a green tablecloth, and lying in the foam midway between the round cairn-headed Knocknarea and [...] "Ben Bulben, famous for hawks": ...|$|E

6000|$|To {{the wise}} peasant the green hills and woods round him {{are full of}} never-fading mystery. When the aged countrywoman stands at her door in the evening, and, in her own words, [...] "looks at the {{mountains}} and thinks {{of the goodness of}} God," [...] God is all the nearer, because the pagan powers are not far: because northward in Ben Bulben, famous for hawks, the white square door <b>swings</b> <b>open</b> at sundown, and those wild unchristian riders rush forth upon the fields, while southward the White Lady, who is doubtless Maive herself, wanders under the broad cloud nightcap of Knocknarea. How may she doubt these things, even though the priest shakes his head at her? Did not a herd-boy, no long while since, see the White Lady? She passed so close that the skirt of her dress touched him. [...] "He fell down, and was dead three days." [...] But this is merely the small gossip of faerydom--the little stitches that join this world and the other.|$|E
60|$|Away {{into the}} winter prospect. There are many such upon the tree! On, by low-lying, misty grounds, through fens and fogs, up long hills, winding dark as caverns between thick plantations, almost {{shutting}} out the sparkling stars; so, out on broad heights, until we stop at last, with sudden silence, at an avenue. The gate-bell has a deep, half-awful {{sound in the}} frosty air; the gate <b>swings</b> <b>open</b> on its hinges; and, as we drive up to a great house, the glancing lights grow larger in the windows, and the opposing rows of trees seem to fall solemnly back on either side, to give us place. At intervals, all day, a frightened hare has shot across this whitened turf; or the distant clatter of a herd of deer trampling the hard frost, has, for the minute, crushed the silence too. Their watchful eyes beneath the fern may be shining now, if we could see them, like the icy dewdrops on the leaves; but they are still, and all is still. And so, the lights growing larger, and the trees falling back before us, and closing up again behind us, as if to forbid retreat, {{we come to the}} house.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{went into}} {{possession}} that afternoon, and old Hard Times {{set out to}} cook his supper. When it was over he sat down by the embers and lit his pipe, the yellow dog lying at his feet. Suddenly 'Rap! rap!' comes from the door. 'Come in,' says the man, gruffly. 'Rap!' again. 'Come in and be d--d to you,' says the man, who has no idea of getting up to open the door. But no one responded, and the next moment smash goes the only sound pane in the only window. Seeing this, old Hard Times gets up, with the devil in his eye, and a revolver in his hand, followed by the yellow dog, with every tooth showing, and <b>swings</b> <b>open</b> the door. No one there! But as the man opened the door, that yellow dog, that had been so chipper before, suddenly begins to crouch and step backward, step by step, trembling and shivering, and at last crouches down in the chimney, without even so much as looking at his master. The man slams the door shut again, but there comes another smash.|$|E

6000|$|A little {{north of}} the town of Sligo, on the {{southern}} side of Ben Bulben, some hundreds of feet above the plain, is a small white square in the limestone. No mortal has ever touched it with his hand; no sheep or goat has ever browsed grass beside it. There is no more inaccessible place upon the earth, and few more encircled by awe to the deep considering. It is the door of faery-land. In the middle of night it <b>swings</b> <b>open,</b> and the unearthly troop rushes out. All night the gay rabble sweep to and fro across the land, invisible to all, unless perhaps where, in some more than commonly [...] "gentle" [...] place--Drumcliff or Drum-a-hair--the nightcapped heads of faery-doctors may be thrust from their doors to see what mischief the [...] "gentry" [...] are doing. To their trained eyes and ears the fields are covered by red-hatted riders, and the air is full of shrill voices--a sound like whistling, as an ancient Scottish seer has recorded, and wholly different from the talk of the angels, who [...] "speak much in the throat, like the Irish," [...] as Lilly, the astrologer, has wisely said. If there be a new-born baby or new-wed bride in the neighbourhood, the nightcapped [...] "doctors" [...] will peer with more than common care, for the unearthly troop do not always return empty-handed. Sometimes a new-wed bride or a new-born baby goes with them into their mountains; the door swings to behind, and the new-born or the new-wed moves henceforth in the bloodless land of Faery; happy enough, but doomed to melt out at the last judgment like bright vapour, for the soul cannot live without sorrow. Through this door of white stone, and the other doors of that land where geabheadh tu an sonas aer pighin ("you can buy joy for a penny"), have gone kings, queens, and princes, but so greatly has the power of Faery dwindled, that there are none but peasants in these sad chronicles of mine.|$|E

50|$|The Preiss RHJ-8 is a homebuilt {{side-by-side}} two-seat flapped glider. It is {{an evolution}} of the Preiss RHJ-7, which was developed from a Schreder HP-14.
