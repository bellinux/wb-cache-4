The <b>subsalt</b> relief reveals a variable morphology below the salt layer, characterized by both convex and concave shapes, indicating the occurrence of radial gravitational gliding at the scale of the entire Gulf of Lions.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Pricaspian Basin in the {{southeast}} of the Russian Platform contains a sedimentary column up to 20 km thick comprising Palaeozoic <b>subsalt</b> formations, Permian salt and suprasalt Mesozoic and Cenozoic terrigeneous formations. The huge oil and gas reserves of the Basin are concentrated in <b>subsalt</b> Upper Palaeozoic carbonate reservoirs.

This suggests that traces of fluids at shallow stratigraphic levels may indicate the deep, <b>subsalt</b> sources of the hydrocarbons and associated components. <b>Subsalt</b> reservoirs at depths of more than 6000 m are targets for future exploration. The location of hydrocarbon pools in such reservoirs may be indicated by geochemical investigations of the salt and of the terrigeneous rocks above the salt.

The input seismic data sets are taken from many large-scale wide-azimuth surveys and conventional narrowazimuth surveys located in the Mississippi Canyon and Atwater Valley areas. In the course of developing the enhanced wide azimuth processing flow, the following three key steps are found to have the most impact on improving <b>subsalt</b> imaging: (1) 3 D true azimuth surface-related multiple elimination (SRME) to remove multiple energy, in particular, complex multiples beneath salt; (2) reverse-time migration (RTM) based delayed imaging time (DIT) scans to update the complex <b>subsalt</b> velocity model; and (3) tilted transverse isotropic (TTI) RTM to improve image quality. Our research focuses on the depth imaging aspects of the project, with particular emphasis on the application of the DIT scanning technique. The DIT-scan technique further improves the accuracy of the <b>subsalt</b> velocity model after conventional ray-based <b>subsalt</b> tomography has been performed.

40|$|A {{significant}} problem in seismic imaging is seismically seeing below salt structures: large velocity contrasts and the irregular {{geometry of the}} salt-sediment interface strongly defocus both the downgoing and upgoing seismic wavefields. This can result in severely defocused migration images so as to seismically render some <b>subsalt</b> reserves invisible. The potential cure is a good estimate of the <b>subsalt</b> and salt velocity distributions, but that is also the problem: severe velocity contrasts prevent the appearance of coherent <b>subsalt</b> reflections in the surface records so that MVA or tomographic methods can become ineffective. We now present an interferometric method for extracting the diffraction signals that emanate from diffractors, also denoted as seismic guide stars. The signal-to-noise ratio of these interferometric diffractions is enhanced by N, where N {{is the number of}} source points coincident with the receiver points.

40|$|<b>Subsalt</b> {{exploration}} {{is an area}} {{of increasing}} interest, but imaging under salt structures is still very challenging and an increased understanding of <b>subsalt</b> imaging is needed. The focus of this master’s thesis is on the sensitivity of <b>subsalt</b> imaging to the migration velocity model. The consequences of employing an erroneous migration velocity model have been studied. The kind of errors introduced to the velocity model include; vertical mispositioning of the rugous top and base of salt, lateral mispositioning of the base and neglection of salt inclusions. Simple 2 -D models of an allochthonous salt sheet with typical parameters from the Gulf of Mexico were constructed. The models include rugous top and base of salt and dirty salt with anhydrite inclusions. Synthetic data was generated by the use of acoustic finite difference modelling, while reverse time migration was employed to produce images of the subsurface. The resulting synthetic depth sections showed that <b>subsalt</b> imaging is very sensitive to the top of salt interpretation, and the quality of this interpretation should therefore be the main focus in execution of a depth imaging project. Errors in depth positioning of the top or base of salt in the velocity model seem to be of secondary importance compared to errors in the salt geometry, and <b>subsalt</b> imaging is significantly more sensitive to the external salt geometry in the velocity model compared to the internal salt geometry. Improved methods for velocity model determination might be needed for adequate <b>subsalt</b> imaging in complex areas with rugous top of salt surfaces. </p...|$|E

We overcome these limitations by the wave-equation migration velocity analysis technique introduced in a companion paper (Sava and Biondi, 2004) and demonstrate the methodology on a realistic synthetic dataset simulating a salt dome environment and a Gulf of Mexico dataset. We model <b>subsalt</b> propagation using wavepaths created by one-way wavefield extrapolation. Those wavepaths are much more accurate and robust than broadband rays, since they inherit the frequency dependence and multipathing of the underlying wavefield. We formulate an objective function for optimization in the image space by relating an image perturbation to a perturbation of the velocity model. The image perturbations are defined using linearized prestack residual migration, thus ensuring stability relative to the first-order Born approximation assumptions.

However, imaging of some steeply dipping <b>subsalt</b> targets such as three-way closures against salt is still difficult.

We apply the visibility analysis method that quantitatively determines which shot records contribute most energy on a specific <b>subsalt</b> prospect area. As a result we selectively migrate only those shot records thereby reducing noise contamination from low energy contributing shot records, improving signal continuity and better trap definition in the target area. Like conventional illumination analysis, the computation takes into account the overburden velocity distribution, acquisition geometry, target reflectivity and dip angle. We used 2 D and 3 D syn-thetic data examples to test the concepts and applicability of the method. A Gulf of Mexico case study example using wide-azimuth data demonstrated its use in an industry scale project. It is shown that for the particular 60 °– 65 ° <b>subsalt</b> target of interest only 30 % of the wide-azimuth shot records are sufficient for the imaging.

40|$|Outcrops {{of mixed}} carbonate/siliciclastic strata {{comprise}} the Neoproterozoic (Marinoan) Wilpena Group at Patawarta diapir in the Flinders Ranges, South Australia. Patawarta diapir is a ramping allochthonous salt sheet flanked by suprasalt and <b>subsalt</b> minibasin strata. The stratal and structural {{attributes of the}} coeval minibasin fills afford a unique perspective on lateral and vertical salt migration and the impacts of salt-modified bathymetry in shallow marine depositional environments. This study documents the depositional and diagenetic facies, stratal thickness trends, and structural style and stratal geometries of the suprasalt minibasin fill and correlates it to the previously studied <b>subsalt</b> minibasin fill. The goal {{is to develop a}} predictive model utilizes stratigraphic and structural relationships of suprasalt strata to effectively identify potential characteristics of correlative <b>subsalt</b> strata. Enhanced understanding of potential relationships adjacent to allochthonous salt will allow for improved pre-drill prediction of minibasin reservoir attributes, thereby limiting the risks involved with <b>subsalt</b> petroleum exploration. ^ The stratigraphic units of interest for this study include the Bunyeroo Formation, Wonoka Formation, and Patsy Hill Member of the Bonney Sandstone, which form parts of two 3 rd-order depositional sequences. The Bunyeroo Formation records deposition in a deep, offshore basin to outer shelf environment during the Transgressive Systems Tract of the lower depositional sequence. The formational contact between the Bunyeroo Formation and overlying Wonoka Formation is interpreted as the maximum flooding surface. The Wonoka Formation represents a regional regressive sequence deposited in a storm-dominated carbonate shelf environment, whereby the lower, middle, and upper limestone, and green mudstone members reflect upward-shallowing outer shelf to shoreface, foreshore, lagoonal, and subtidal to intertidal settings. The Patsy Hill Member, which includes the lower dolomite, sandstone, and upper dolomite beds, records deposition in a barrier bar-lagoonal complex. The lower dolomite beds of the Patsy Hill Member reflect ongoing normal regression from the underlying Wonoka Formation to an intertidal setting, whereas the sandstone and upper dolomite beds document a non-Waltherian shift to more basinward deposition in the barrier bar-lagoonal complex. Therefore, the Wonoka Formation and Patsy Hill lower dolomite beds comprise the Highstand Systems Tract of the lower depositional sequence, while the Patsy Hill sandstone and upper dolomite beds form the Lowstand Systems Tract of the upper depositional sequence. An erosional unconformity between the Patsy Hill lower dolomite and sandstone beds is interpreted as the sequence boundary separating the lower and upper depositional sequences. ^ Suprasalt Bunyeroo, Wonoka, and Patsy Hill strata thin gradually, but dramatically towards Patawarta diapir from ~ 3500 to 20 m over distances of 3 - 6 km, primarily by low-angle onlap and depositional thinning with local angular stratal truncations. Flanking suprasalt Wilpena Group strata form a broad, open fold above the allochthonous salt body with significant thinning, but only minor halokinetic upturn, which represents minibasin-scale folding and thinning. The local angular stratal truncations documented at the basal contact of the Wonoka middle limestone member and at the sequence boundary within the Patsy Hill Member are interpreted as tapered composite halokinetic sequence boundaries adjacent to the suprasalt margin. ^ Correlation of suprasalt strata to the previously studied <b>subsalt</b> strata utilizes the depositional sequence stratigraphy to evaluate characteristic stratigraphic, geometric, and halokinetic relationships in coeval minibasin fills. Wonoka strata reflect consistent trends in depositional facies and interpreted depositional settings between the suprasalt and <b>subsalt</b> minibasins {{with the exception of the}} uppermost green mudstone member. Patsy Hill strata vary significantly in regards to depositional facies and interpreted depositional settings in the suprasalt and <b>subsalt</b> minibasins. <b>Subsalt</b> Bunyeroo, Wonoka, and Patsy Hill strata form two stacked tapered composite halokinetic sequences, whereby significant folding and thinning occurred within 560 m of the subsalt-sediment interface. Because halokinetic sequence boundaries developed in different stratigraphic levels in the coeval minibasins despite presumably analogous sedimentation rates, it is concluded that halokinetic deformation cannot be correlated from one side of an allochthonous salt body to another. The stratigraphic and structural analysis of suprasalt strata flanking Patawarta diapir and correlation to coeval <b>subsalt</b> strata reveal that, despite many similarities in the shallow marine environment, the depositional and halokinetic history of coeval minibasin fills do not display characteristic, predictable relationships. Although this does not allow for a predictive model of the characteristics of <b>subsalt</b> minibasin fill based on correlative suprasalt strata, it does contribute to a growing catalogue of petroleum system possibilities that ideally reduce exploration risks. ...|$|E

The salt fracture gradient is estimated from Eq. (17) with C =  500 psi, which matches the measured FIT data in the salt.

40|$|Accurate {{velocity}} {{model building}} is a key in achieving high quality <b>subsalt</b> images. To reach this goal, we propose a target oriented and efficient velocity analysis methodology. Our methodology comprises of two steps. In the first step the surface data is downward extrapolated to a new datum plane using a beam based redatuming algorithm. In the second step we switch to a Kirchhoff or fast beam migration algorithm to perform the actual velocity analysis. The redatuming process has the advantage that it not only regularizes the subsurface data, but also reduces the data to a shorter recording times and a narrower offset range. Most importantly the resulting wave field at the new datum plane is generally much simpler in nature as supra salt sediment and top salt reflected as well as refracted arrivals have been removed – hence revealing the weaker <b>subsalt</b> events. A fast migration method can therefore be used to scan the <b>subsalt</b> velocity {{to determine the best}} image quality. As the beam based redatuming converts the irregular surface data into regular data at the datum level, it can also be used as a regularization tool...|$|E

There has been some attempt to incorporate salt inclusion however salt anisotropy seems to be ignored in the seismic velocity model building and imaging by industry. We challenge the common assumption that salt anisotropy can be ignored in velocity model building for seismic imaging.

40|$|Significant {{quantities}} of hydrocarbons {{are found in}} complex salt environments. One of the modern challenges of exploration and production activities is to image below salt. This challenge arises from the complexities of salt structures, weak primaries from the <b>subsalt,</b> and the interference of free-surface multiples with the weak primaries of the <b>subsalt.</b> To effectively process <b>subsalt</b> data, {{we need to develop}} a method of attenuating free-surface multiples that preserves the amplitude and phase of primaries and does not introduce artifacts at either near and far offsets. In this thesis, we will demonstrate that the weak primaries of the <b>subsalt</b> can be preserved while attenuating free-surface multiples. The method used for the demonstration is the bottom-multiple generator (BMG) reflector approximation. This technique requires that a portion of the data containing only primaries be defined. A multidimensional convolution of the data containing only primaries with the actual data will predict free-surface multiples and hence is used to attenuate free-surface multiples from the actual data. This method {{is one of the most}} effective methods for attenuating free-surface multiples; however, the method requires muting data at the BMG location. One of the issues investigated in this thesis, is to establish the sensitivity of the BMG demultiple technique when the mute at the BMG location end up cutting some seismic reflections, which can be the case in complex environments such as the Gulf of Mexico and Gulf of Guinea, where freesurface multiples interfere with primaries. For this investigation, we generated synthetic data through the 2 D elastic finite-difference modeling technique. The synthetic seismic data contain primaries; free-surface multiples, and internal multiples, and direct waves acquired over a 2 D geological model that depicts a shallow-water geology. In this thesis, we also investigate if the first step of the BMG demultiple technique can sufficiently attenuate free-surface multiples. For this investigation, we designed a 2 D geological model, which depicts the deep offshore environment, and we generated synthetic data through the 2 D elastic finite-difference modeling technique. After performing the various investigations mentioned above, the following conclusions were made, that the demultiple result is not affected when the mute at the BMG location end up cutting some primaries, that the first step of the BMG demultiple technique is not sufficient for the demultiple, and that the weak <b>subsalt</b> primaries are preserved during demultiple processes.

This aspect in addition to high velocities within the salt tend to scatter and defocus seismic energy and make imaging of <b>subsalt</b> lithology extremely difficult. An ongoing program the SEG/EAEG modeling project (Aminzadeh et al. 1994 a: Aminzadeh et al. 1994 b: Aminzadeh et al. 1995), and a follow-up project funded as part of the Advanced Computational Technology Initiative (ACTI) (House et al. 1996) have sought to investigate problems with imaging beneath complex salt structures using numerical modeling and more recently, construction of a physical model patterned after the numerical <b>subsalt</b> model (Wiley and McKnight. 1996). To date, no direct comparison of the numerical and physical aspects of these models has been attempted. We present the results of forward modeling a numerical realization of the 3 D salt canopy physical model with the French Petroleum Institute (IFP) acoustic finite difference algorithm used in the numerical <b>subsalt</b> tests. We compare the results from the physical salt canopy model, the acoustic modeling of the physical/numerical model and the original numerical SEG/EAEG Salt Model. We will be testing the sensitivity of migration to the presence of converted shear waves and acquisition geometry...|$|E

40|$|Salt has unusual {{properties}} which complicate seismic exploration. A Model {{study examines}} some problems encountered in <b>subsalt</b> amplitude analysis and demonstrates that traditional techniques for detecting hydrocarbons and overpressured sediments using amplitude and velocity analysis are severely limited <b>subsalt.</b> Strong mode conversions generated at salt-sediment interfaces intrinsically limit amplitude versus offset techniques by diverting {{a significant amount}} of energy away from P-wave reflections. Some of the information lost from P-wave reflections is recouped by examining mode converted reflection amplitudes. Mode conversions are sensitive to different rock properties than P-waves, and those generated at the base of salt bodies are easily identified using acoustic and elastic modeling comparisons. Models demonstrate the use of base of salt converted mode amplitudes to gauge the strength of P-wave reflections for hydrocarbon discrimination. Further, mode converted amplitudes are used in conjunction with P-wave amplitudes from base of salt to detect overpressuring directly beneath salt...|$|E
40|$|The Caspian syneclise {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{promising}} hydrocarbon regions in Russia and Kazakhstan, which is confirmed by the discovery in recent years of large oil and gas fields within its borders. The presence in the Caspian syneclise at several stratigraphic levels of clay-carbonate deposits enriched with dispersed organic matter, a sufficiently high degree of their catagenetic transformation, the passage of the so-called «oil window» – all indicates a favorable situation for the generation of hydrocarbons in the region under consideration. The spread of possible accumulations of oil and gas in the <b>subsalt</b> sediments of the syneclise is mainly controlled by the quality of the reservoirs and impermeable layers. The proposed article illustrates the authors’ attempt to create a generalized model for the formation of <b>subsalt</b> strata and to develop a scheme for the interrelationship between the processes of accumulation of carbonate sediments and their hydrocarbon productivity. The application of the obtained results to the practice of oil and gas prospecting can be of great importance, since the evaluation of the hydrocarbon productivity of the subsoil is impossible without the prediction of the spatial distribution of differentfacial deposits playing the role of accumulating and preserving strata. The revealed regularities of the space-time relationships of the formation of the main elements of natural reservoirs responsible for the oil and gas content in the <b>subsalt</b> sediments can serve to some extent as a base for the growth of hydrocarbon reserves, which is so necessary for the Caspian region...|$|E
40|$|Throughout {{the history}} of {{exploration}} for hydrocarbons, illumination and imaging in structurally complex geology with high-velocity contrasts has been a challenge. Recently introduced technological innovations such as dual-sensor streamers towed behind seismic vessels, provide new means to tackle these problems. Separating wavefields into upgoing and downgoing constituents triggered new, unconvential ways in imaging such as Seperated Wavefield imaging (SWIM). Given the new possibilities, phenomena like surface-related multiple reflections, which have alway been treated as noise in conventional processing, emerge interest treated as useful signal. Within this transition, however, their contribution to subsurface illumination is yet unclear. Using survey design and ray tracing softwares, forward modelling of acoustic wave propagation is carried out in a complex geologic model incorporating varying velocities of the sedimentary overburden and a salt pillow. Distinct surface-related multiple reflections from 1 st to 3 rd order are defined to investigate their contribution in illumination of a <b>subsalt</b> target which is compared to the illumination of primary reflections. Different seismic vessels were defined {{being part of the}} classical NATS versus a modern WATS acquisition geometry. After an enhanced illumination study, the ray tracing results suggest that incorporating the defined 1 st to 3 rd order surface-related multiple reflections illuminating the <b>subsalt</b> target partially fill illumination gaps left by primary reflections, can replace a dual azimuth NATS survey which considers primaries only, greatly infill <b>subsalt</b> illumination gaps using WATS and can replace a WATS survey using primaries only, if they are treated as signal in a NATS survey.

40|$|Some {{hydrocarbon}} reservoirs {{are trapped}} beneath salt bodies, where seismic imaging is greatly challenged due to poor illumination. Multiple reflections have different propagation wave paths from primary reflections {{and thus can}} be used to complement the illuminations where primary reflections from beneath the salt are not acquired. Consequently, migration of multiples can sometimes provide better <b>subsalt</b> images compared to conventional migration which uses primary reflections only. In this paper, we propose to modify conventional reverse time migration so that multiples can be used as constructive reflection energy for <b>subsalt</b> imaging. This new approach replaces the impulsive source wavelet with the recorded data containing both primaries and multiples and uses predicted multiples as the input data instead of primary reflections. In the reverse time migration process, multiples recorded on the surface are extrapolated backward in time to each depth level, and the observed data with both primaries and multiples are extrapolated forward in time to the same depth levels, followed by a crosscorrelation imaging condition. A numerical test on the Sigsbee 2 B data set shows that a wider coverage and a more balanced illumination of the subsurface can be achieved by migration of multiples compared with conventional migration of primary reflections. This example demonstrates that reverse time migration of multiples might be a promising method for complex <b>subsalt</b> imaging.
