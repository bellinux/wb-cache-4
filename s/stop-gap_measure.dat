Clark decided not to resign but to stay on and try to restrain Benn in the future. Benn bore him no ill-will for this and in 1974 asked him to join the government committee into the future of ailing car-makers Austin and British Leyland.

25|$|The {{intention}} was to use the Gannet as a <b>stop-gap</b> <b>measure</b> prior to the acquisition of a new, purpose built system intended to be used on the planned new generation of aircraft carriers. As a consequence, {{it was intended to}} undertake as {{little in the way of}} modification as possible - the AN/APS-20 radar from the Skyraider would be mounted in a radome under the fuselage of an ordinary Gannet AS.1, with the associated electronics and space for two operators inside. However, the size of the radome meant that the existing airframe was too close to the ground to accommodate the radar, and so a significant modification to the fuselage was required. This involved removing the observer's cockpits and creating a new cabin within the fuselage; this was accessed via a pair of hatches next to the trailing edge of the wing, which also meant that the exhausts had to be moved from this position to the leading edge; increasing the total area of the vertical stabiliser to compensate for the instability caused by the radome; and extending the length of the undercarriage to increase the clearance for the radome, which consequently increased the aircraft's overall height by , and gave the aircraft a more level stance than the anti-submarine version. Such were the extensive modifications required that, in December 1954, it was suggested that the AEW version be renamed as the Fairey Albatross, as it was to all intents and purposes a completely different aircraft from its ASW predecessor. As it was, by the time the Gannet AEW was entering service, the ASW version was in the process of being replaced, avoiding any potential confusion.|$|E

5000|$|In {{view of the}} Catholic resistance, the May Laws of 1873 gave {{responsibility}} for the training and appointment of clergy to the state, {{which resulted in the}} closing of nearly half of the seminaries in Prussia by 1878.

John Beverley Robinson often was central to vital discussions where he revealed both his intelligence and social biases favouring gentlemen of capital. Extremely complicated issues have deflected attention from the central issue: whether the colony needed equity, whether it needed to follow English law. The episodes show that Upper Canadians of many political outlooks were not at all convinced that their society should embrace English law.
