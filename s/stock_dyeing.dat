50|$|<b>Stock</b> <b>dyeing,</b> top dyeing, and tow dyeing {{are used}} to dye fibers at various stages of the {{manufacturing}} process prior to the fibers being spun into yarns. The names refer to the stage at which the fiber is when it is dyed. All three are included under the broad category of fiber dyeing.|$|E
30|$|Crystal violet (CV) used in {{this study}} was {{procured}} from S.D. Fine-Chem. Ltd. (India) (CI 42555, MF: C 25 H 30 CIN 3) λmax: 579  nm) and used without further purification. <b>Stock</b> <b>dye</b> solution (1, 000  mg L− 1) was prepared by dissolving 1  g of the dye in 1  L of double distilled water. Experimental dye solution of different concentrations was prepared by diluting the stock solution with suitable volume of double distilled water.|$|R
30|$|MB (C.I. 52015, FW: 319.86, MF: C 16 H 18 N 3 SCl) used in {{this study}} was of {{commercial}} purity and used without further purification. <b>Stock</b> <b>dye</b> solution (500  mg L− 1) was prepared by dissolving 0.5  g of the dye in 1  L of distilled water. Experimental dye solution of desired concentration was prepared by further dilution of the stock solution with suitable volume of distilled water. The initial solution pH was adjusted with 0.1  M HCl and 0.1  M NaOH solutions using a digital pH meter (LI 127, ELICO, India) calibrated with standard buffer solutions.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{members of}} the {{aquarium}} trade want to ban this practice. For example, the British publication Practical Fishkeeping started a campaign in 1996 to ask retailers to stop selling dyed fish, {{which led to a}} significant decrease in the number sold in the United Kingdom. Practical Fishkeeping has launched a similar campaign with a global scope and maintains a register of stores which do not <b>stock</b> <b>dyed</b> fish. [...] The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) regards the practice as cruel and unnecessary cosmetic mutilation. A campaign in Australia and in the UK has limited the sale of these fish. Dyed fish are still available and are generally imported from Southeast Asia.|$|R

There {{is one of the}} transport boats starting in half an hour. I shall want to lay in a <b>stock</b> of <b>dye.</b> Fortunately, the exact colour is not material, for the natives are any shade between yellow and black." ...|$|R
5000|$|Kammarkarbin: {{also known}} as [...] "gallery carbine". Unique serial numbers prefixed by K. Total number {{produced}} is unknown, with the highest reported serial number being K.193 currently in a private collection in the United States. One {{has been reported in}} Switzerland. Carbine K.91 is in the Carl Gustaf factory museum in Sweden. Other differences from the standard m/1894 carbine include the <b>stock</b> being <b>dyed</b> black. The rifling rate of twist is about 4 times faster than the m/1894 carbine due to the unique bullet and much slower velocity of the special cartridge intended for this carbine. The only two receiver dates noted so far are 1898 and 1901.|$|R
30|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} parameters such as adsorbate concentration, adsorbent dose and contact time were studied. A definite weight of calcined eggshell powder was added into 50  mL of dyes solution with initial concentration of 1 – 10  mg/L which is prepared from 1000  mg/L of <b>dyes</b> <b>stock</b> solutions. The contents were shaken thoroughly. The solutions were then filtered at present time interval and residual metal concentration {{was measured using}} Spectrophotometric method.|$|R
50|$|The BSC is a {{non-profit}} organization, {{incorporated in the}} State of New York, {{for the purpose of}} ensuring a supply of high quality stains (mostly dyes) for use in biological and medical laboratories. Its origins date from 1922, when vendors of biological stains in the USA had exhausted their <b>stocks</b> of pre-war <b>dyes</b> imported from Germany. American dye manufacturers were unable to produce products that were consistently reliable in histological microtechnique and bacteriology (Conn 1980-1981; Penney 2000).|$|R
30|$|Rhodamine is a {{basic dye}} having IUPAC name [9 -(2 -carboxyphenyl)- 6 -diethylamino- 3 -xanthenylidene]-diethylammonium {{chloride}} has been purchased from S.D. Fine chemicals, Mumbai, India. <b>Stock</b> solution of <b>dye</b> (500  mg L− 1) has been prepared by dissolving 0.5  g of dye in 1000  mL of deionised water. Another solution of desired concentration has been prepared by successive dilutions of the stock solution. Concentration of the dye after adsorption has been determined using Shimadzu— 1800 UV Visible Spectrophotometer at 553  nm wavelength.|$|R
30|$|Solutions for {{investigations}} {{were prepared}} as follows. First, stock solutions of MB in water (1  mmol/L) were prepared. To obtain VNPs–MB aqueous solutions, required {{amount of the}} <b>dye</b> <b>stock</b> solution and VNPs aqueous solution were added in a flask and carefully stirred using a rotary evaporator (Rotavapor R- 3, Buchi) during 1  h to a complete evaporation of chloroform. Then, 1  mL of a VNPs aqueous solution was added in a flask and gently shaken during 1  h for VNPs–MB complex formation. The concentration of MB in the obtained solution was 10  μmol/L. The concentrations of nanoparticles were 0.1, 1, or 10  mg/mL.|$|R
30|$|The <b>dye</b> <b>stock</b> {{solution}} was prepared by dissolving 76.5  g of walnut into 3  litres of water. The extracted dye {{solution was}} divided into different concentrations ranging between 1 and 20 % (o.w.f.). The dyeing experiments were performed using M: L ratio of 1 : 40 in separate baths with manual agitation at pH 7 using 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20 % (o.w.f.) dye concentrations. Woolen yarns were drenched to dyeing baths containing warm dye solution. The dye bath temperatures were raised to simmering point (91 – 93  °C) and {{at a rate of}} 2  °C per min and maintained at that level for 60  min (Rather et al. 2016 a, b). Finally dyed samples were washed with 5  ml/L non-ionic detergent (Safewash Wipro), rinsed with running tap water, and dried in shade.|$|R
30|$|According to <b>Stocks</b> (2004), certain <b>dyes</b> can be {{very useful}} for {{studying}} the viability of cells. Substances like propidium iodide (PI) or Syto 9 are popularly used for this purpose. PI {{has been found to}} penetrate cells with damaged membranes, whereas Syto 9 is capable of penetrating the cells nonspecifically, resulting in a green fluorescence. Thus, when used simultaneously, Syto 9 can replace PI and thus change the colour of the cells under fluorescence (530  nm). Two times washed bacterial cell suspension was incubated with and without CTAB 30  µg/ml. Here, the bacterial cell suspensions (both CTAB 30  µg/ml and untreated blank) were stained with 2.5  μM SYTO 9 and 15  μM PI and incubated for 5  min in the dark. Cells were monitored under a confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM; Andor spinning disk confocal microscope). The laser was used at 488  nm for excitation, and the emission was observed at 528  nm (SYTO 9) and 645  nm (PI). Cells containing intact cell surface were stained fluorescent green, whereas with disrupted membranes, stained fluorescent red. The overlap of the red and green areas appears as orange (Sarkar et al. 2015). The image was analysed with ImageJ software.|$|R
30|$|Environmental {{pollutant}} is {{the major}} cause for most of health illness. Water is {{the main source of}} contamination and pollution which effects health through biomagnification. Water gets polluted by harmful chemicals, dyes, oils etc. All the wastewater that contains harmful chemicals is drained into nearby water bodies. This causes water pollution and will lead to various health problems to flora and fauna. Among the pollutants of water, dyes play a major role. Most of the dyes released from the pharma and textile industries are mutagenic, toxic and teratogenic that can cause serious health hazards to humans and live <b>stock</b> [1]. <b>Dyes</b> released into environment can impart color to water and also decrease or stop capacity of water reoxygenation by blocking sunlight thereby increasing BOD value. Therefore these conditions can prevent or disturb the growth of aquatic plants and animals [2, 3]. The color removal from wastewater from industries is the main concern in green chemistry [4]. Removal of dyes from wastewater has become a tough issue due to their stable character under harsh condition and biodegradation resistance [5]. There have been reports on usage of natural materials like coconut husk, sunflower stalks, barley husk, lemon peels, rice husk to remove dyes [6]. Advanced oxidation process (AOP) of photocatalysis is really efficient in industrial effluent treatment process with more success rates. Many studies reported that TiO 2 nanoparticles are an excellent photocatalysts for decolorization of dyes. TiO 2 microparticles are less toxic, less resistance and less corrosive than other photocatalysts [7, 8]. TiO 2 oxidation is also known as a type of “green” or environmental friendly method [9]. TiO 2 nanoparticles are used extensively because of its intensity and very high refractive index. We used dopants such as Zn and Cu to observe the efficiency of TiO 2 microparticles on dye degradation. Doping techniques are used to incorporate metal ions to enhance photocatalytic effects of TiO 2 nanoparticles. Metal ions such as Cobalt, Iron, Nickel, Tungsten, Zinc can be incorporated during preparation [10, 11].|$|R
