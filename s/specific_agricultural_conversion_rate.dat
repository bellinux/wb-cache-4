The altitude of anthropogenic non-stocked forest land oscillates about 850 m above sea level, and covers an area which {{was included in the}} border zone of the state border with Austria until recently. The main production programme of the farm is animal production, namely cattle breeding without a market milk production. The SWOT analysis method was used to analyse subjective as well as objective presumptions of suitability of the farm for conversion purposes. It was used to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. The results achieved were used for assessment and comparison with information processed in bibliography. The facts revealed indicated that the current state of conventional farming already fully corresponds to the principles and requirements applied in the organic farming systems. At the end it was stated that the farm has the best presumptions for a successful conversion...|$|R

Database techniques are adopted. Database platform of county agricultural production technology in Yunnan Province is established by using B/S structure. This platform includes presentation layer, application layer, and data layer, involving regional information, technology column information, technology classification information, technology content and other database. It has six functional modules, namely information browse, system management, regional maintenance, technical section maintenance, category maintenance and technical information release, integrating crop cultivation, livestock breeding, economic forest management, plant protection, agricultural products processing, agricultural machinery use and other agricultural technical information. This platform can exchange information dynamically with the client, perform the query request from users, and send the results to users. This database platform has friendly interface, profuse information, high pertinency and so on, which offers rich and reliable information resources to farmers, agricultural technical personnel, and government. At present, this platform has been popularized in some areas of Yunnan Province and has obtained good results.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{guidance}} paper of the European Psychiatric Association is to provide evidence-based recommendations on the early detection of a clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis in patients with mental problems. To this aim, we conducted a meta-analysis of studies reporting on <b>conversion</b> <b>rates</b> to psychosis in non-overlapping samples meeting any at least {{any one of the}} main CHR criteria: ultra-high risk (UHR) and/or basic symptoms criteria. Further, effects of potential moderators (different UHR criteria definitions, single UHR criteria and age) on <b>conversion</b> <b>rates</b> were examined. <b>Conversion</b> <b>rates</b> in the identified 42 samples with altogether more than 4000 CHR patients who had mainly been identified by UHR criteria and/or the basic symptom criterion ‘cognitive disturbances’ (COGDIS) showed considerable heterogeneity. While UHR criteria and COGDIS were related to similar <b>conversion</b> <b>rates</b> until 2 -year follow-up, <b>conversion</b> <b>rates</b> of COGDIS were significantly higher thereafter. Differences in onset and frequency requirements of symptomatic UHR criteria or in their different consideration of functional decline, substance use and co-morbidity did not seem to impact on <b>conversion</b> <b>rates.</b> The ‘genetic risk and functional decline’ UHR criterion was rarely met and only showed an insignificant pooled sample effect. However, age significantly affected UHR <b>conversion</b> <b>rates</b> with lower rates in children and adolescents.

It is argued that despite several equilibrium exchange rate theories not all of them are useful for the real policy choice of the nominal <b>conversion</b> <b>rate.</b> This and the intrinsic uncertainty of equilibrium exchange rate estimates lead {{to the conclusion that the}} range of “optimal” euro <b>conversion</b> <b>rates</b> is quiet wide and other issues must be taken into account. In particular, a smooth transition to the euro <b>conversion</b> <b>rate</b> and minimisation of risks of potential shocks to the economy should be the key concern.

40|$|Knowledge {{concerning}} the <b>conversion</b> <b>rate</b> of tritium gas to tritiated {{water in the}} environment is basic data needed for estimating the risk of exposure to tritium gas. The <b>conversion</b> <b>rate</b> is affected by {{various factors such as}} the tritium concentration, dust and moisture in the atmosphere, bacteria in the soil, and solar rays, etc. However, the influence of solar rays on the <b>conversion</b> <b>rate</b> has not been investigated hitherto. From this viewpoint, we examined the influence of ultra-violet (UV) irradiation on the <b>conversion</b> <b>rate</b> of room temperature. The reaction vessel (RV) {{used in the present study}} was spherical flask made of Pyrex or quartz. A given amount of the mixture of oxygen and tritium diluted with hydrogen was introduced into the RV and then UV-irradiation was carried out. The partial pressure of the tritium gas was kept constant at 0. 6 Torr (5 μCi/ml) and the oxygen pressure was varied from 20 to 160 Torr. A high pressure mercury lamp was used as a light source. The <b>conversion</b> <b>rate</b> was determined by the amount of the tritiated water formed. This was measured by a liquid scintillation counter. Only tritium gas was introduced to clarify the contribution of the exchange reaction with the trace amount of water in the RV, however, little tritiated water was formed. The initial <b>conversion</b> <b>rate</b> of the gas mixture without UV-irradiation was of an order of magnitude of 0. 01 %/day, which corresponded to the tritium decay rate. From these results, it was revealed that the exchange rate of tritium gas with the water adsorbed on inner wall of the RV was negligibly small in comparison to the <b>conversion</b> <b>rate,</b> and that most of the tritiated water formed came from the β-radiation-induced oxidation. In addition, it was observed that with UV-irradiation the <b>conversion</b> <b>rate</b> was about 1000 times greater than that of nonirradiation. In particular, wave lengths ranging from 200 to 300 nm were effective for converting tritium gas. The primary conclusion was that solar rays would play an important role in the <b>conversion</b> <b>rate</b> of tritium gas in the environment...|$|R
