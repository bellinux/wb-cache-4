5|$|The grapes {{typically}} {{produce a}} robust red wine, {{although in the}} United States a <b>semi-sweet</b> rosé (blush-style) wine called White Zinfandel has six times as many sales as the red wine. The grape's high sugar content can be fermented into levels of alcohol exceeding 15 percent.|$|E
5|$|In Mexico, hot {{chocolate}} remains a popular national drink, often including <b>semi-sweet</b> chocolate, cinnamon, sugar, and vanilla. Hot chocolate {{of this type}} is commonly sold in circular or hexagonal tablets which can be dissolved into hot milk, water, or cream, and then blended until the mixture develops a creamy froth. A 1942 article in the Chicago Tribune describes Mexican cinnamon {{hot chocolate}} as being traditionally served alongside a variety of sweet Mexican pastries, such as pan dulce or churros.|$|E
25|$|Germany {{produces}} wines in many styles: dry, <b>semi-sweet</b> {{and sweet}} white wines, rosé wines, red wines and sparkling wines, called Sekt. (The only wine style not commonly produced is fortified wine.) Due to the northerly {{location of the}} German vineyards, the country has produced wines quite unlike any others in Europe, many of outstanding quality. Between the 1950s and the 1980s German wine was known abroad for cheap, sweet or <b>semi-sweet,</b> low-quality mass-produced wines such as Liebfraumilch.|$|E
25|$|Usually {{indicated}} {{for better}} wines {{and often the}} numbers are arranged in some logical order, although the same numbers need not return in each vintage. This practice seems to be most common for <b>semi-sweet</b> and sweet wines in the Mosel region.|$|E
25|$|The {{grapefruit}} (Citrus × paradisi) is a subtropical citrus tree {{known for}} its sour to <b>semi-sweet,</b> somewhat bitter fruit. Grapefruit is a hybrid originating in Barbados as an accidental cross between two introduced species, sweet orange (C. sinensis) and pomelo or shaddock (C. maxima), {{both of which were}} introduced from Asia in the seventeenth century.|$|E
25|$|Chocolate is {{a common}} cause of {{poisoning}} in dogs. The toxic principles in chocolate are theobromine and caffeine. Baker's chocolate {{is the most dangerous}} form since it contains higher concentrations of these drugs, followed by <b>semi-sweet,</b> dark, and then milk chocolate. Signs include vomiting, diarrhea, tremors, difficulty walking, seizures, and heart problems.|$|E
25|$|Some {{producers}} {{also use}} additional propriate designations to denote quality or ripeness level within a Prädikat. These {{are out of}} the scope of the German wine law. Especially for Auslese, which can cover a wide range of sweetness levels, the presence of any of these designations tends to indicate a sweet dessert wine rather than a <b>semi-sweet</b> wine. These designations are all unregulated.|$|E
25|$|Riesling is the {{benchmark}} grape in Germany and covers the most area in German vineyards. It is an aromatic variety {{with a high}} level of acidity that can be used for dry, <b>semi-sweet,</b> sweet and sparkling wines. The drawback to Riesling is that it takes 130 days to ripen and, in marginal years, the Riesling crop tends to be poor.|$|E
25|$|The wines of Montecarlo region {{include several}} {{varieties}} {{that are not}} commonly found in Tuscan wines including Sémillon and Roussanne. The minor Chianti grape Ciliegiolo is also popular here. The island of Elba {{has one of the}} longest winemaking histories in Tuscany and is home to its own DOC. Some of the wines produced here include a sparkling Trebbiano wine, a sweet Ansonica passito, and a <b>semi-sweet</b> dessert wine from Aleatico.|$|E
25|$|A <b>semi-sweet</b> QbA {{from the}} Rheingau, Nahe, Rheinhessen or Pfalz, {{consisting}} at least 70% of the varieties Riesling, Müller-Thurgau, Silvaner or Kerner. In practice {{there is very}} little Riesling in Liebfraumilch since varietally labelled Riesling wines tend to fetch a higher price. Liebfraumilch may not carry a varietal designation on the label. Liebfraumilch is probably Germany's most notorious wine type, and is in principle a medium-quality wine designation although more commonly perceived to be a low-quality wine both at home and on the export market.|$|E
25|$|Chenin blanc is an {{authorized}} planting in many Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) regions but is mostly {{planted in the}} Middle Loire AOCs of Anjou, Bonnezeaux, Crémant de Loire, Coteaux de l'Aubance, Coteaux du Layon, Jasnières, Montlouis, Quarts de Chaume, Saumur, Savennières, and Vouvray. The wines of the Coteaux du Layon, Bonnezeaux, and Quarts de Chaume are produced as sweet dessert wines, while Savennières produce predominately dry wines. The wines of Anjou, Crémant de Loire, Coteaux de l'Aubance, Jasnières, Montlouis, Saumur, and Vouvray have {{a wide range of}} sweetness levels, from dry to <b>semi-sweet</b> to sweet.|$|E
25|$|An aronia wine {{is made in}} Lithuania. In Poland, aronia berries are dried to make an {{herbal tea}} {{sometimes}} blended with other ingredients, such as blackcurrant. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the berries are sold fresh and frozen or made into juices, jams and teas. Aronia is also used as a flavoring or colorant for beverages or yogurts. Juice from the ripe berries is astringent, <b>semi-sweet</b> (moderate sugar content), sour (low pH), and contains {{a low level of}} vitamin C. The berries have a tart flavor and, in addition to juice, can be baked into breads. In the United States and Canada, aronia juice concentrate is used in manufactured juice blends.|$|E
25|$|This is {{wine from}} one of the 13 {{wine-growing}} regions (Anbaugebiete), and the region must be shown on the label. It is a basic level of everyday, mostly inexpensive quaffing wines. The grapes are at a fairly low level of ripeness, with must weights of 51°Oe to 72°Oe. The alcohol content of the wine must be at least 7% by volume, and chaptalization (adding sugar to the unfermented grape juice to boost the final alcohol level, which in no way alters the sweetness) is often used. QbA range from dry to <b>semi-sweet,</b> and the style is often indicated on the label, along with the designation Qualitätswein and the region. Some top-level dry wines are officially QbA although they would qualify as Prädikatswein.|$|E
25|$|The aromas {{and flavor}} notes of Chenin blanc often include the {{descriptors}} of minerally, greengage, angelica and honey. Chenin wines produced from noble rot will often have notes of peaches and honey that develop into barley sugar, marzipan, and quince as they age. Dry or <b>semi-sweet</b> Chenin blanc from the Loire will often have notes apple, greengage, and chalky minerals that develop into more honey, acacia, and quince aromas. New World styles of Chenin, {{such as those}} of South Africa, are more often made to be consume young and exhibit rich tropical fruit notes such as banana, guava, pear, and pineapple. The alcohol level for dessert styles Chenin rarely goes above 12%, which keeps the wines more in balance. Drier styles of Chenin {{are more likely to be}} around 13.5%.|$|E
25|$|In the Soviet Union, {{sparkling}} wine was produced {{under the name}} Soviet Champagne, or Sovetskoye Shampanskoye, most of it sweet. This designation continues {{to be used for}} {{sparkling wine}} produced in several countries formerly part of the Soviet Union, including Armenia, Belarus, Moldova, Russia and Ukraine. Most likely, the name has stuck since Sovetskoye Shampanskoye {{was one of the few}} products or brands of the Soviet era which were seen as luxurious. Often the names have been altered to fit the exact country, e.g. Armenian Champagne. Nowadays, it is more common to encounter Sovetskoye Shampanskoye produced in a dry or semi-dry style. The products have some international popularity, thus Russian made dry and semi-dry versions can be found in the European markets and Moldovan made <b>semi-sweet</b> version from Muscat grapes has been regularly available in the U.S.|$|E
25|$|As a wine country, Germany has a mixed {{reputation}} internationally, {{with some}} consumers on the export markets associating Germany with the world's most elegant and aromatically pure white wines while other see the country mainly {{as the source}} of cheap, mass-market <b>semi-sweet</b> wines such as Liebfraumilch. Among enthusiasts, Germany's reputation is primarily based on wines made from the Riesling grape variety, which at its best is used for aromatic, fruity and elegant white wines that range from very crisp and dry to well-balanced, sweet and of enormous aromatic concentration. While primarily a white wine country, red wine production surged in the 1990s and early 2000s, primarily fuelled by domestic demand, and the proportion of the German vineyards devoted to the cultivation of dark-skinned grape varieties has now stabilized at slightly {{more than a third of}} the total surface. For the red wines, Spätburgunder, the domestic name for Pinot noir, is in the lead.|$|E
500|$|Riesling {{is a white}} grape variety which {{originated}} in the Rhine region of Germany. Riesling is an aromatic grape variety displaying flowery, almost perfumed, aromas as well as high acidity. It is used to make dry, <b>semi-sweet,</b> sweet, and sparkling white wines. Riesling wines are usually varietally pure and are seldom oaked. As of 2004, Riesling {{was estimated to be}} the world's 20th most grown variety at [...] (with an increasing trend), but in terms of importance for quality wines, it is usually included in the [...] "top three" [...] white wine varieties together with Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc. Riesling is a variety which is highly [...] "terroir-expressive", meaning that the character of Riesling wines is greatly influenced by the wine's place of origin.|$|E
2500|$|A {{chocolate}} chip cookie is a drop cookie which features {{chocolate chip}}s as its distinguishing ingredient. The traditional recipe combines a dough composed of butter and both brown and white sugar with <b>semi-sweet</b> chocolate chips. Ruth Wakefield of Whitman, Massachusetts invented chocolate chips and {{chocolate chip cookies}} in 1930. Her new cookie invention was called the [...] "Toll House Cookie" [...] which used broken-up bars of <b>semi-sweet</b> chocolate.|$|E

2500|$|Although [...] "blush" [...] {{originally}} {{referred to}} a color (pale pink), it now tends to indicate a relatively sweet pink wine, typically with 2.5% residual sugar; in North America dry pink wines are usually marketed as rosé but sometimes as blush. In Europe, almost all pink wines are {{referred to a}}s rosé regardless of sugar levels, even <b>semi-sweet</b> ones from California. As the term rosé regained popularity in the US market, shares of wine labeled [...] "blush" [...] declined from 22% of all wines consumed in the US in 1997 to 15% in 2003.|$|E
2500|$|There are two {{late harvest}} classifications, Vendange Tardive (VT) and Sélection de Grains Nobles (SGN). Vendange Tardive means [...] "late harvest" [...] (which in German would be Spätlese), {{but in terms}} of must weight requirements, VT is similar to Auslese in Germany. Sélection de Grains Nobles means [...] "selection of noble berries", i.e. grapes {{affected}} by noble rot, and is similar to a German Beerenauslese. For both VT and SGN, Alsace wines tend to be higher in alcohol and therefore slightly lower in sugar than the corresponding German wines. Therefore, Riesling VT and Muscat VT tend to be <b>semi-sweet</b> rather than sweet, while Gewürztraminer and Pinot gris tend to be rather sweet already at VT level. But {{as is the case with}} sweetness in other Alsace wines, this depends to a large extent on the house style of the producer.|$|E
2500|$|In 1976, wine writer Jerry D. Mead visited Mill Creek Vineyards in Sonoma County, California. Charles Kreck {{had been}} one of the first to plant Cabernet Sauvignon vines in California, and offered Mead a wine made from Cabernet that was a pale pink and as yet unnamed. Kreck would not call it [...] "White Cabernet" [...] as it was much darker in colour than red grape [...] "white" [...] wines of the time, yet it was not as dark as the rosés he had known. Mead jokingly {{suggested}} the name [...] "Cabernet Blush", then that evening phoned Kreck to say that he no longer thought the name a joke. In 1978 Kreck trademarked the word [...] "Blush". The name caught on as a marketing name for the <b>semi-sweet</b> wines from producers such as Sutter Home and Beringer. Today, Blush wine appears on wine lists more often as a category, rather than a specific wine. In 2010 Mill Creek produced a rosé wine for the first time in years, although Jeremy Kreck (Charles' grandson and current winemaker) chose not to use the Blush name.|$|E
2500|$|Almost all {{wines are}} white, except those {{made from the}} Pinot noir grape which are pale red, often rosé, rarely red (e.g. [...] ). Sparkling wines known as Crémant d'Alsace are also made. Much of the white wines of Alsace are made from {{aromatic}} grape varieties, so many characteristic Alsace wines are aromatic, floral and spicy. Since they very seldom have any oak barrel aromas {{they tend to be}} very varietally pure in their character. Traditionally all Alsace wines were dry (which once set them apart from German wines with which they share many grape varieties), but an ambition to produce wines with more intense and fruity character has led some producers to produce wines which contain some residual sugar. Since there is no official labeling that differentiates completely dry from off-dry (or even <b>semi-sweet)</b> wines, this has occasionally led to some confusion among consumers. It is more common to find residual sugar in Gewürztraminer and Pinot gris, which reach a higher natural sugar content on ripeness, than in Riesling, Muscat or Sylvaner. Usually there is a [...] "house style" [...] as to residual sugar, i.e., some producers only produce totally dry wines, except for their dessert style wines.|$|E
6000|$|I first [...] "realised" [...] Fourteenth Street at a {{very tender}} age, and I {{perfectly}} recall that flush of initiation, consisting as it did of an afternoon call with my father at a house there situated, one of an already fairly mature row {{on the south side}} and quite near Sixth Avenue. It was as [...] "our" [...] house, just acquired by us, that he thus invited my approval of it--heaping as that does once more the measure of my small adhesiveness. I thoroughly approved--quite as if I had foreseen that the place was to become to me for ever so long afterwards a sort of anchorage of the spirit, being at the hour as well a fascination for the eyes, since it was there I first fondly gaped at the process of [...] "decorating." [...] I saw charming men in little caps ingeniously formed of folded newspaper--where in the roaring city are those quaint badges of the handicrafts now?--mounted on platforms and casting plaster into moulds; I saw them in particular paste long strips of yellowish grained paper upon walls, and I vividly remember thinking the grain and the pattern (for there was a pattern from waist-high down, a complication of dragons and sphinxes and scrolls and other fine flourishes) a wonderful and sumptuous thing. I would give much, I protest, to recover its lost secret, to see what it really was--so interesting ever to retrace, and sometimes so difficult of belief, in a community of one's own knowing, is the general æsthetic adventure, are the dangers and delusions, the all but fatal accidents and mortal ailments, that Taste has smilingly survived and after which the fickle creature may still quite brazenly look one in the face. Our quarter must have bristled in those years with the very worst of the danger-signals--though indeed they figured but as coarse complacencies; the age of [...] "brown stone" [...] had just been ushered in, and that material, in deplorable, in monstrous form, over all the vacant spaces and eligible sites then numerous between the Fifth and Sixth Avenues, more and more affronted the day. We seemed to have come up from a world of quieter harmonies, the world of Washington Square and thereabouts, so decent in its dignity, so instinctively unpretentious. There were even there spots of shabbiness that I recall, such as the charmless void reaching westward from the two houses that formed the Fifth Avenue corner to our grandfather's, our New York grandfather's house, itself built by him, with the happiest judgment, not so long before, and at no distant time in truth to be solidly but much less pleasingly neighboured. The ancient name of the Parade-ground still hung about the central space, and the ancient wooden palings, then so generally accounted proper for central spaces--the whole image infinitely recedes--affected even my innocent childhood as rustic and mean. Union Square, {{at the top of the}} Avenue--or what practically then counted for the top--was encased, more smartly, in iron rails and further adorned with a fountain and an aged amateur-looking constable, awful to my generation in virtue of his star and his switch. I associate less elegance with the Parade-ground, into which we turned for recreation from my neighbouring dame's-school and where the parades deployed on no scale to check our own evolutions; though indeed the switch of office abounded there, for what I best recover in the connection is a sense and smell of perpetual autumn, with the ground so muffled in the leaves and twigs of the now long defunct ailanthus-tree that most of our own motions were a kicking of them up--the <b>semi-sweet</b> rankness of the plant was all in the air--and small boys pranced about as cavaliers whacking their steeds. There were bigger boys, bolder still, to whom this vegetation, or something kindred that escapes me, yielded long black beanlike slips which they lighted and smoked, the smaller ones staring and impressed; I at any rate think of the small one I can best speak for as constantly wading through an Indian summer of these disjecta, fascinated by the leaf-kicking process, the joy of lonely trudges, over a course in which those parts and the slightly more northward pleasantly confound themselves. These were the homely joys of the nobler neighbourhood, elements that had their match, and more, hard by the Fourteenth Street home, in the poplars, the pigs, the poultry, and the [...] "Irish houses," [...] two or three in number, exclusive of a very fine Dutch one, seated then, this last, almost as among gardens and groves--a breadth of territory still apparent, on the spot, in that marginal ease, that spread of occupation, to the nearly complete absence of which New York aspects owe their general failure of [...] "style." ...|$|E
