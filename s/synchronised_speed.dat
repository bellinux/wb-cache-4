50|$|Until recently, most longarm {{machines}} were hand-guided which meant the operator had to <b>synchronise</b> the <b>speed</b> {{of their hands}} {{with that of the}} machine motor. Fast hands and slow motor meant big stitches. Slow hands and fast motor meant small stitches. Since just {{after the turn of the}} century, most longarm machines are now sold with stitch-regulation, which means that the operator no longer has to synchronize hand speed with that of the motor. Electronics in the machine ensure the stitch length remains constant. More recently, fully computerized machines are being sold. Fully computerized machines have been available for over 12 years. They were invented by Paul Statler but have only recently become popular.

40|$|AbstractShort {{duration}} (∼ 1 s) PEO treatments {{have been}} applied to aluminium alloy samples on which coatings of thickness ∼ 100 μm had previously been created. This was done using the small area electrical monitoring system previously developed in the Gordon Laboratory in Cambridge. Voltage supply frequencies of 50 Hz and 2. 5 kHz were employed. Fairly high resolution SEM micrographs were taken, covering the whole surface of small area samples (ie over a circular area of diameter about 0. 9 mm). This was done {{both before and after}} the 1 s PEO treatments. X-ray tomographic data were also obtained in the vicinity of a recently-completed set of discharges. The outcomes of these observations were correlated with <b>synchronised</b> high <b>speed</b> electrical monitoring and video photography, carried out during the PEO treatment periods. Localised cascades (comprising hundreds of individual discharges) were observed in all cases, persisting throughout the 1 s periods and also reappearing in the same location when a second 1 s PEO treatment was applied to the same sample. This repetition of discharges at the same location is apparently due to the deep pores associated with these sites, creating a pathway of low electrical resistance, even after appreciable oxidation has occurred in the vicinity. Observations were made of the way in which the surfaces were reconstructed locally as discharge cascades occurred. With the high frequency voltage supply, discharge lifetimes were limited to the half-cycle period (of 200 μs), but in other respects the cascades were similar to those with the lower frequency. However, some discharges occurred during cathodic half-cycles with the high frequency supply, at the same location as the anodic discharges in the cascade concerned...|$|R

40|$|Barn owls have {{undergone}} many adaptations to optimize flight behaviour for catching small rodents in environments where visibility is impaired. These birds have, for example, developed structures that reduce noise production during flight {{and they have}} adapted wing form to slow flight. For such reasons, the wing of the barn owl serves – in a biomimetic sense - {{as a role model}} for the construction of airplane wings. The biological part of such a project is to exactly measure wing form. Measuring under life conditions {{has turned out to be}} a difficult problem, because wing form in bird flight is not constant. The DLR Göttingen and the RWTH Aachen have developed two different systems which allow high precision measurements of the owl wings during free flight. Both systems rely on multiple cameras that record the barn owl during flight. The first system uses a fine random pattern of light points which is projected onto the wing surfaces. Each surface is being recorded by two <b>synchronised</b> high <b>speed</b> cameras. By correlating the dot patterns recorded by the two cameras a 3 D model can be generated. The second approach uses a number of laser sheets, to create cross sections of the wing. Line lasers are affixed to a frame so that unbroken laser lines are projected onto the wing surface perpendicular to the flight path. The shape of the laser lines on the wing surface is recorded with single-lense reflex cameras, and three-dimensional shape of the upper and lower side of the wing is reconstructed. The weaknesses and the strengths of both approaches will be discussed and compared...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the cooperative path-following problem of multiple marine surface vehicles subject to dynamical uncertainties and ocean disturbances induced by unknown wind, wave and ocean current. The control design falls neatly into two parts. One is to steer individual marine surface vehicle to track a predefined path {{and the other}} is to <b>synchronise</b> the along-path <b>speed</b> and path variables under the constraints of an underlying communication network. Within these two formulations, a robust adaptive path-following controller is first designed for individual vehicles based on backstepping and neural network techniques. Then, a decentralised synchronisation control law is derived by means of consensus on along-path speed and path variables based on graph theory. The distinct feature of this design lies in that synchronised path following can be reached for any undirected connected communication graphs without accurate knowledge of the model. This result is further extended to the output feedback case, where an observer-based cooperative path-following controller is developed without measuring the velocity of each vehicle. For both designs, rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrate that all signals in the closed-loop system are semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded. Simulation results validate the performance and robustness improvement of the proposed strategy...|$|R

40|$|This thesis takes {{interest}} rates as {{the topic of}} interest, and studies financial market integration in China. Paper I studies structural determinants and temporal coefficients of {{interest rates}} scattered over 6 th - 20 th century China. Detailed findings concern intrinsic loan features (such as maturity and creditor type, among others) and how they affected the interest rate level. Overall, interest rates decreased in the markets under study, with fluctuations corresponding with dynastic cycles, up-and-down. The two interest rate troughs are found around the 9 th - 11 th century of the Song dynasty and the 19 th century of the late Qing period. Significant events of political economy (wars and recovery, international relations and trade, etc.) significantly affected interest rates, but mostly through temporary shocks; economic development and its ensuing financial advancement (in institution, innovation, markets, etc.) tended to show qualitative and long-run impact on financial markets and interest rates. Part II estimates financial integration regarding 14 th- 20 th century China. Firstly estimated is pair-wise integration based on time-series data in 18 th- 20 th century China. Before 1840, distance was the major (but not the only) determinant of financial integration. The maximum range of financial integration {{at the time was}} up to 1, 400 kilometres, which was slightly farther than that of commodity (grain) integration and confirms the macro-region theory of Skinner in that there was little cross-regional market interplay. However, the overall integration performance for the period before 1840 was limited, with large gaps between distance groups regarding both interest divergence and adjustment speed. A national financial market did not seem to emerge until the 19 th century, when both local and cross-regional capital markets became more homogeneous (with converging interest rate gaps and <b>synchronising</b> arbitrage <b>speed).</b> However, the final wars (the 2 nd anti-Japanese war and the 2 nd civil war in China) before the People’s Republic of China (PRC) stopped this integration process. Secondly, overall integration among 23 provincial markets scattered over 57 years in the Ming and Qing period may be explained by three factors: education, population, and the relative position of the local market to all other markets. The spatial autoregressive coefficients were negative, suggesting that a local provincial market was negatively related to all other markets. Education and population represent the influence of innovation and commerce on overall integration respectively. They are positively associated with interest rate gaps, hence negatively connected to integration. However, such negative relationships might denote financial development in local markets, which lowered local interest rates and temporarily enlarged the interest rate gaps. Neither arable land nor warfare involvement was significant in explaining overall financial integration...|$|R
40|$|Imaging based optical {{diagnostics}} {{have played}} an important role in combustion and fluids studies. However, most imaging techniques are two dimensional. The increasing interest in accurate whole field measurement has heightened the need for developing three dimensional methods. Furthermore, many flows are inherently 3 D in nature. One aim of this study is to develop an innovative 3 D schlieren/shadowgraph system based on conventional schlieren/shadowgraph techniques. Furthermore, several research issues related to fluid mechanics and combustion are investigated using multi optical methods, including high speed direct/schlieren imaging, stereo imaging and 3 D reconstruction and PIV techniques, etc. Firstly, a stereoscopic shadowgraph system has been developed using two sets of conventional z-type schlieren configurations. The test volume is set at the intersection of two inclined converging beams formed by two pairs of parabolic mirrors. Two <b>synchronised</b> high <b>speed</b> cameras are used to record the shadowgraph image pairs simultaneously. A precisely etched metal mesh plate is used to calibrate the stereoscopic shadowgraph system. The fully developed MATLAB code is employed to obtain calibration parameters and 3 D coordinates reconstruction. A crystal block with internal 3 D images is acted as a static model for point reconstruction. The 3 D coordinates obtained are in good agreement with the real dimensions. The technique has been subsequently applied to investigate the bursting dynamics of a bubble. The 3 D curve reconstruction is also accomplished successfully. The stereoscopic shadowgraph technique has been shown to be an effective method for both 3 D visualisation and quantitative measurement. Secondly, the spark induced hot gas jet of a gas turbine combustor igniter has been investigated using optical methods with the combination of high speed schlieren and stereo imaging. A spherical shockwave and a hot gas jet are observed after spark initiation. The 3 D velocity vectors of the flying off metal bits are calculated by a stereo imaging and reconstruction algorithm. It has been found that the amount and velocity distributions of the eroded metal bits are very different even at a fixed input voltage to the igniter, which contrasts with the quite consistent hot gas jet development. The 3 D structures of the interaction boundaries between hot gas and ambient air are reconstructed for the first time using stereoscopic shadowgraph technique. Thirdly, the vortex dynamics and structures of methane-air diffusion flames are investigated under different co-flow conditions. The schlieren and PIV images show that the visible flame flickering is dominated by the dynamics of the external toroidal vortices outside. The co-flow air is observed to push the initiation point of toroidal vortices beyond the visible flame height and suppress flame flickering completely. The velocity vectors and vorticity contours at different air flow rates are presented and analysed. The shedding frequency of the toroidal vortex is found to be consistent with the result obtained from a photomultiplier. The investigation indicates that co-flow helps to depress flame instability by changing the vortex evolution. Finally, a laminar diffusion flame is studied under external acoustic excitation at different frequencies (6 Hz- 100 Hz). The flame structures and vortex evolutions are investigated using high-speed stereo/schlieren imaging and digital imaging processing techniques. The flame frequency shows obvious nonlinear response to both the excitation frequency and amplitude. Several typical nonlinear phenomena were observed and analysed, which may serve as proof for relevant numerical simulation. ...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this project}} was to research, develop and test an {{induction}} motor drive not requiring a speed encoder, but which could be considered commercially viable by motor drives manufacturers, and which should aim to meet the follow requirements: • Dynamic torque performance and steady state speed-holding accuracy to be comparable with encodered vector controlled drives • Extensive and highly accurate knowledge of electrical and mechanical parameters of the motor and load not to be required • Extensive commissioning from an expert engineer not to be necessary • Algorithm not to rely on excessive computational capability being available The drive was to operate, in a stable manner, over speed and load ranges at least comparable with commercially available sensorless induction motor drives. The above requirements were set such that the developed sensorless technique may be considered for synchronised multi-motor process applications, where the advantages of a sensorless system could be exploited for hazardous, damp and hot conditions. The solution developed consists of a leading model-based sensorless method augmented with a speed estimator that tracks harmonics, seen in the stator terminal quantities, due to rotor slotting. The model-based scheme facilitates field-orientated control for dynamic performance. The slot harmonic speed estimator tunes the model for speed accuracy. Slot harmonics are identified using a recursive signal processing method termed the Recursive Maximum Likelihood - Adaptive Tracking Filter. This work is the first example of the method being developed into a practical sensorless drive system and the complete speed identifier is described, including set-up, pre-filtering and the minimal parameter considerations. Being recursive the method is computationally efficient, yet has accuracy comparable with that of FFT identifiers used in other work. The developed sensorless strategy was implemented practically on two motor drive systems. The performance of the scheme is shown to give encoder like speed holding accuracy and field-orientated dynamic performance. The two drives were also configured and tested as a <b>speed</b> <b>synchronised</b> pair, using applicable multi-motor control techniques, themselves compared and contrasted. The sensorless performance is demonstrated, alongside an encodered version acting as a benchmark, {{and the performance of}} the two schemes is shown to be highly comparable. The author has found no other example of sensorless techniques considered for use in multi-motor applications. The use of such a technique brings established advantages associated with encoder removal and allows multi-axis electronic synchronisation to be considered for parts of a process where an encoder may not be appropriate...|$|R
40|$|This project {{evaluated}} the metal transfer behaviour of the variable polarity (VP) GMAW process. Analysis was performed using high speed video that was <b>synchronised</b> with high <b>speed</b> data acquisition. Melting rate measurements {{were found to}} be very dependent on current waveform, polarity, and droplet size, and metal transfer if it occurred, for each waveform period. The transient conditions of current waveform and metal transfer produced rapid changes in arc behaviour which influenced the melting at the electrode tip and growing droplet. The concentrated melting theory was developed to explain the significant increase in electrode extension burnoff and droplet growth rate that occurred at short EN time as a function of current, and during EP peak pulse when the pre-pulse droplet volume was small. The highest electrode extension burnoff and droplet growth rate occurred when the arc was permitted to climb over the solid electrode tip producing rapid concentrated melting. Likewise, large molten droplets were found to promote a negative electrode extension burnoff and a decreased droplet growth rate. The arc rooted on large droplets providing additional heating but limited electrode melting. The droplet burnoff rate (DBR) method was developed and found to yield good experimental measurements for the arc and resistive heating coefficients used in a 2 nd order melting rate equation developed for a complex waveform process, like VP-GMAW. For the EN period, the EN time affected the melting rate as a function of EN current. The greater melting rate that occurred at low EN time was measured by the changes in the resistive heating coefficient. Concentrated arc melting of the electrode extension at low EN time caused the slope of the burnoff diagram to increase, which represented the resistive heating coefficient. The melting rate of the EP pulse was related to the pre-pulse droplet volume. Large pre-pulse droplets decreased the arc heating coefficient, which could be negative, which meant the electrode extension was increasing and the arc length was decreasing in that waveform period. VP-GMAW power supplies offered stable operation for welding sheet structures on both carbon steel and stainless steel. Higher travel speeds were required as the %EN of the waveform increased to produce acceptable constant deposit area fusion. Welding speeds were up to 300 % higher with VP-GMAW compared to the GMAW-P process when welding lap joints on 1. 8 mm thick material with a 1. 8 mm gap. VP-GMAW heat input was up to 47 % less than GMAW-P for the same melting rate...|$|R

The PMSG-WTs are widely used in wind energy conversion systems(WECSs), due to their merits such as high reliability, high efficiency, low noise, high torque to weight ratio and fast dynamic response. Usually, a PMSG-WT {{is connected to the}} power grid via an AC-DC-AC converter system. The PMSG-WT can rotate at varying speed based on variable wind power input and thus achieve high efficiency as it dose not need to <b>synchronise</b> its rotational <b>speed</b> with the grid frequency. An overview of the modeling of the PMSG-WT is give at first, with conventional vector control (VC) strategies applied for machine-side and grid-side converter. The VC strategy is a popular method widely used in industry due to its decoupled control of active/reactive power, but it may not provide satisfactory performance for the PMSG-WT as it is required to operate at varying speed in an operation envelope with wide operating range rather than one operation point. The feedback linearisation control (FLC) strategy can improve the performance of the VC with a global optimal controller crossing a wide region and variable operation points, but it has weak robustness against parameter uncertainties and external disturbances, and requires full state measurements. To improve performance of the VC and the FLC, nonlinear adaptive controllers (NACs) designed based on FLC and perturbation estimation and their applications in machine-side and grid-side converter control of the PMSG-WT, and speed control of a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) have been studied. In the design of the proposed NAC, by defining a lumped perturbation term to present coupling nonlinear dynamics, parameter uncertainties, and other unknown disturbance, then a perturbation observer is designed to estimate the perturbation which is used to compensate the real perturbation and realise an adaptive linearising of the original nonlinear system, without requiring the accurate system model and parameters and full state measurements, and still considering all system nonlinearities and unknown time-varying dynamics, such as tower shadow, grid faults and intermittent wind power inputs. In this thesis, the proposed control schemes are applied for control of PMSGWT in Region 2, Region 3 and integration with the grid. A NAC is developed for a PMSG-WT to extract maximum wind power in Region 2. Simulation and experiment studies are carried out to verify the design and results show that the proposed NAC can provide better performance in MPPT and robustness against parameter uncertainties and time-varying wind power inputs, in comparison with a convention VC and FLC. NACs are designed for control of the pitch angle and generator control of a PMSG-WT to limit the extracted power from time varying wind in Region 3. Simulation results of the proposed NACs are compared to a conventional VC and FLC. The fault ride-through capability (FRTC) of the PMSG-WT at different voltage dip’s levels has been enhanced by a novel NAC applied at the grid-side converter. Simulation results have shown that the proposed NAC can provide satisfactory performances with smaller inrush current and voltage overshoots during grid fault and better robustness against uncertainties. A coordinated nonlinear adaptive control (CNAC) of the machine-side and grid-side converter in the PMSG-WT were studied. The NACs are designed based on state and perturbation observers for control of subsystems. Simulation results show that the CNAC can coordinate each other to achieve the objectives of different operating regions and enhance the FRTC of the PMSG-WT. Finally, the proposed control schemes are applied for control of PMSM. NAC is developed for PMSM to track mechanical rotation speed and provide high robustness against system parameter uncertainties and unknown time-varying load disturbances. Simulation results show that the proposed NAC provides better performance and robustness against system parameter uncertainties and unknown time-varying load disturbances, in comparison with a nonlinear controller with an extended nonlinear observer and a conventional VC...|$|R
