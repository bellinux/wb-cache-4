6000|$|By {{the time}} I {{was ready to}} leave the ship again I thought I had learned enough of the working of the double and <b>single</b> <b>pulley,</b> by which {{passengers}} were let down from the upper deck of the ship to the steamer below, and determined to let myself down without assistance. Without saying anything of my intentions to any one, I mounted the railing, and taking hold of the centre rope, just below the upper block, I put {{one foot on the}} hook below the lower block, and stepped off just as I did so some one called out [...] "hold on." [...] It was too late. I tried to [...] "hold on" [...] with all my might, but my heels went up, and my head went down so rapidly that my hold broke, and I plunged head foremost into the water, some twenty-five feet below, with such velocity that it seemed to me I never would stop. When I came to the surface again, being a fair swimmer, and not having lost my presence of mind, I swam around until a bucket was let down for me, and I was drawn up without a scratch or injury. I do not believe there was a man on board who sympathized with me in the least when they found me uninjured. I rather enjoyed the joke myself. The captain of the Suviah died of his disease a few months later, and I believe before the mutineers were tried. I hope they got clear, because, as before stated, I always thought the mutiny was all in the brain of a very weak and sick man.|$|E

50|$|The typical {{configuration}} (see diagram) uses two <b>single</b> <b>pulleys</b> and two Prusik knot loops {{or other}} suitable friction hitches. These Prusiks provide fixed attach-points {{on the rope}} that can be moved when slightly loosened. The first Prusik knot provides the mechanical advantage. The second Prusik knot {{can be used to}} hold the position of the rope and is sometimes referred to as a 'progress capture device' or ratchet. It is also advisable to attach a towel or soft object (such as a life vest) {{to the end of the}} line near the connection to the object being pulled since the line is under high tension and could break free and present a dangerous flying hazard.|$|R

50|$|Consider {{lifting a}} weight with rope and pulleys. A rope looped through a pulley {{attached}} to a fixed spot, e.g. a barn roof rafter, and attached to the weight is called a <b>single</b> <b>pulley.</b> It has a mechanical advantage (MA) = 1 (assuming frictionless bearings in the pulley), moving no mechanical advantage (or disadvantage) however advantageous the change in direction may be.|$|E
50|$|A dumb pulley {{can lift}} very large masses a short distance. It {{consists}} of two fixed pulleys of unequal radii that are attached {{to each other and}} rotate together, a <b>single</b> <b>pulley</b> bearing the load, and an endless rope looped around the pulleys. To avoid slippage, the rope is usually replaced by a chain, and the connected pulleys by sprockets.|$|E
50|$|Cable machines, {{also known}} as pulley machines, are large upright machines, either with a <b>single</b> <b>pulley,</b> or else a pulley {{attached}} to both sides. They allow an athlete to recruit all major muscle groups while moving in multiple planes. Cable machines also provide a smooth, continuous action which reduces the need for momentum to start repetitions, provide a constant tension on the muscle, peak-contraction is possible {{at the top of}} each rep, a safe means of performing negative repetitions, and a variety of attachments that allow great flexibility in the exercises performed and body parts targeted.|$|E

5000|$|This {{ability to}} bend the belt at the designer's whim allows it to take a complex or [...] "serpentine" [...] path. This can assist {{the design of a}} compact engine layout, where the {{accessories}} are mounted more closely to the engine block and without the need to provide movable tensioning adjustments. The entire belt may be tensioned by a <b>single</b> idler <b>pulley.</b>|$|R
50|$|A further {{advantage}} of the polygroove belt that makes them popular {{is that they can}} run over pulleys on the ungrooved back of the belt. Though this is sometimes done with V-belts with a <b>single</b> idler <b>pulley</b> for tensioning, a polygroove belt may be wrapped around a pulley on its back tightly enough to change its direction, or even to provide a light driving force.|$|R
5000|$|The zip-line trolley is {{the frame}} or {{assembly}} {{together with the}} pulley(s) also known as sheave(s) inside that run along the cable. (The term [...] "trolley" [...] is more often used when this assembly consists {{of more than a}} <b>single</b> <b>pulley</b> with simple hanger and bearing.) Often more than one pulley is used to spread the load over more than one spot on the cable, to reduce cable bending stresses that may lead to metal fatigue and cable breakage. This also reduces any tendency of a pulley to twist sideways and run off the cable, with disastrous results. In addition, the trolley is usually shaped with guards to hold the cable in the groove(s) of the pulley(s).|$|E
50|$|The two {{sections}} of chain carrying the <b>single</b> <b>pulley</b> exert opposing and unequal torques on the connected pulleys, such {{that only the}} difference of these torques has to be compensated manually by pulling the loose part of the chain.This leads to a mechanical advantage: the force needed to lift a load is {{only a fraction of}} the load's weight. At the same time, the distance the load is lifted is smaller than the length of chain pulled by the same factor. This factor (the mechanical advantage MA) depends on the relative difference of the radii r and R of the connected pulleys:The effect on the forces and distances (see figure) is quantitatively:The difference in radii can be made very small, making the mechanical advantage of this pulley system very large.In the extreme case of zero difference in radii, MA becomes infinite, thus no force (besides friction) is needed to move the chain, but moving the chain will no longer lift the load.|$|E
5000|$|Lucien Juy owned {{a bicycle}} shop in Dijon, Côte d'Or, France. [...] It {{was there that}} he made the first Simplex {{derailleur}} in 1928. The bicycle historian Hilary Stone said: [...] "It used a <b>single</b> <b>pulley</b> to tension the chain {{and a pair of}} guide plates to push the chain to each one of two sprockets. The whole arm was spring-loaded in order to tension the chain - this was the first use of the sprung top pivot which was to become {{an essential part of the}} modern indexed derailleur as we know it today. The pulley and guide plates were moved sideways on a push-rod by means of a chain pulling through the centre of the push-rod. Lucien Juy managed to persuade the management of the Alcyon racing team to fit his Le Simplex gear to their machines for the 1928 Paris-Roubaix - unfortunately the riders revolted and refused to use the new unproven gears." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the mechanical advantage of a block and tackle system consider the simple case of a gun tackle, which has a single mounted, or fixed, <b>pulley</b> and a <b>single</b> movable <b>pulley.</b> The rope is threaded around the fixed block and falls down to the moving block where it is threaded around the pulley and brought back up to be knotted to the fixed block.|$|R
5000|$|In the fingers, {{the deep}} and {{superficial}} flexor tendons {{pass through a}} fibro-osseous tunnel system - the flexor mechanism - of annular and cruciate ligaments called pulleys. The cruciate pulleys tether the long flexor tendons. The number and extent of these cruciate and annular ligaments varies among individuals, but three cruciate and four or five annular ligaments are normally found in each finger (usually referred to as, for example, [...] "A1 pulley" [...] and [...] "C1 pulley"). The thumb has a similar system for its long flexor tendon but with a <b>single</b> oblique <b>pulley</b> replacing the cruciate pulleys found in the fingers.|$|R
40|$|The rubber v-belt {{continuously}} variable transmission (RVB-CVT) in motorcycle is very important because it affects good drive ability in terms of response and smoothness for the rider or passenger. RVB-CVT mechanically consists of primary clutch, secondary clutch and V-belt. The new mechanism of mechanical RVB-CVT components with electric motor is introduced. The objectives of this thesis are to design and to simulate a new actuate the electro-mechanical <b>single</b> acting <b>pulley</b> rubber V-belt {{continuously variable}} transmission. The electro-mechanical <b>single</b> acting <b>pulley</b> rubber V-belt {{continuously variable transmission}} (EMSAP RVB-CVT) system consists of two sets of pulleys, primary pulley and cam mechanism placed on input fixed shaft and secondary pulley placed on the secondary fixed shaft. The primary pulley design changes to reduce the centrifugal force generated by {{the mass of the}} weights and clutch spring, replaced the cam mechanism which is controlled by a DC motor through a gear's mechanism. Each set of the pulley has two moveable sheaves that can be shifted axially along the shaft. A spring is inserted {{in the back of the}} secondary pulley sheave to provide continuous clamping force to the belt and to reduce excessive slip during transmission ratio change. Solidwork software used to drawing detail of EMSAP RVB-CVT. Simulation using Matlab and Simulink software to determine the CVT ratio obtained in addition to get the response of the design that has been created. The results show that a new design of EMSAP RVB-CVT is successfully design and simulate.

40|$|Tendon {{injuries}} are {{the second most}} common injuries of the hand and therefore an important topic in trauma and orthopedic patients. Most {{injuries are}} open injuries to the flexor or extensor tendons, but less frequent injuries, e. g., damage to the functional system tendon sheath and pulley or dull avulsions, also need to be considered. After clinical examination, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging have proved to be important diagnostic tools. Tendon injuries mostly require surgical repair, dull avulsions of the distal phalanges extensor tendon can receive conservative therapy. Injuries of the flexor tendon sheath or <b>single</b> <b>pulley</b> injuries are treated conservatively and multiple pulley injuries receive surgical repair. In the postoperative course of flexor tendon injuries, the principle of early passive movement is important to trigger an &#x 201 C;intrinsic&#x 201 D; tendon healing to guarantee a good outcome. Many substances were evaluated to see if they improved tendon healing; however, little evidence was found. Nevertheless, hyaluronic acid may improve intrinsic tendon healing...|$|E

A new bend type fatigue testing machine that uses two pulleys (DP) has been developed to perform tests on the basis of tension-compression loading cycles. The results have been compared with those obtained by using an existing <b>single</b> <b>pulley</b> (SP) machine that performs only tensile-tensile loading cycles. Although the DP machine can impose compressive to tensile bend stresses at different constant mean stress, it was observed that, for low stress ranges and large constant mean stresses the machine performed equivalent bend tests to those using the SP machine. The fatigue performance of amorphous wires was improved on substituting Fe by Cr and on decreasing the constant mean stress. The high tensile (HT) steel wire apparently had better fatigue performance than amorphous wires in terms of stress range; however, when the results were expressed in terms of strain range, the fatigue performance of amorphous wires was slightly better than HT steel wires, as had been demonstrated in previous studies. It was observed that, when the DP machine performed compressive to tensile bending stress cycles, the fracture surfaces differed from those observed in the SP machine. Under tensile to tensile conditions, the fracture surfaces observed for samples tested in the DP machine were similar to those tested in the SP machine. Fracture mechanics analysis of the results suggests that embrittlement is occurring ahead of growing fatigue cracks in these amorphous wires...|$|E

Note: if an additional pulley is used to change the direction of the rope, e.g. the person doing the work wants to stand on the ground instead of on a rafter, the mechanical advantage is not increased.|$|R

40|$|Pulleys, first devised in the 3 rd century BCE, {{make it easy}} {{to reverse}} the {{direction}} of a lifting force in a fixed axle or to mitigate the work required to lift an object with multiple wheels in a movable state.

50|$|Most systems {{include a}} brake {{to stop the}} wires from {{unravelling}} completely if a wire breaks or tension is lost. German systems usually use a <b>single</b> large tensioning <b>pulley</b> (basically a ratchet mechanism) with a toothed rim, mounted on an arm hinged to the mast. Normally the downward pull of the weights and the reactive upward pull of the tensioned wires lifts the pulley so its teeth are well clear of {{a stop on the}} mast. The pulley can turn freely while the weights move up or down as the wires contract or expand. If tension is lost the pulley falls back toward the mast, and one of its teeth jams against the stop. This stops further rotation, limits the damage, and keeps the undamaged part of the wire intact until it can be repaired. Other systems use various braking mechanisms, usually with multiple smaller pulleys in a block and tackle arrangement.|$|R
