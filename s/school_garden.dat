A November 2008 Ofsted inspection accorded the school a Grade 1 (outstanding). Some former pupils of the school are now scattered worldwide, as far as Australia. The school hosts its own pre-school facility, the Bluebird Pre-school Playgroup. As of 2009, the school is an award holder in the schools section of the Clean Air Awards Scheme, under the auspices of Lincolnshire County Council. It was cited as a Flagship School for the Food for Life Partnership 2009–2010, achieving a bronze award, partly for its cookery club. In 2010 it won Best <b>School</b> <b>Garden</b> in the East Midlands and a gold medal with Britain in Bloom. In 2009 the school had won a silver gilt medal in the same competition. This was one of the first schools to be rated as a National Healthy School under the programme of the same name. It has been given the gold award for the quality and range of its sports provision under the Active Mark Scheme. A pupil at the school received The Local's Rose Award in 2009 for caring for his mother during illness. Local respect was demonstrated in 2008 for this school's educational and fundraising work, when its school fete received a flypast by a Spitfire and Dakota. In 2007 and 2008, pupils filled 200 shoe boxes with gifts for needy children {{as part of the}} Operation Christmas Child appeal. Pupils continue charity work outside the school; for example a pupil has contributed to the local newspaper's appeal to send gift boxes to military personnel serving abroad.|$|E
500|$|Blyton {{cemented}} {{her reputation}} as a children's writer when in 1926 she took over the editing of Sunny Stories, a magazine that typically included the re-telling of legends, myths, stories and other articles for children. That same year she was given her own column in Teachers' World, entitled [...] "From my Window". Three years later she began contributing a weekly page in the magazine, in which she published letters from her fox terrier dog Bobs. They proved to be so popular that in 1933 they were published in book form as Letters from Bobs, and sold ten thousand copies in the first week. Her most popular feature was [...] "Round the Year with Enid Blyton", which consisted of forty-eight articles covering aspects of natural history such as weather, pond life, how to plant a <b>school</b> <b>garden</b> {{and how to make}} a bird table. Among Blyton's other nature projects was her monthly [...] "Country Letter" [...] feature that appeared in The Nature Lover magazine in 1935.|$|E

60|$|In those sad days {{her heart}} was easily touched. She gave him her hand for the second time. He held it gently for a moment. Every day since they had parted {{she had been in}} his thoughts; she had become dearer to him than ever. He was too deeply {{affected}} to trust himself to answer. That silence pleaded for him as nothing had pleaded for him yet. In her secret self she remembered with wonder how she had received his confession in the <b>school</b> <b>garden.</b> It was a little hard on him, surely, to have forbidden him even to hope.|$|E
60|$|It {{remains to}} add that a death did {{actually}} occur in Vincent Terrace, just beyond the <b>school</b> <b>garden,</b> and, so far as can be proved, {{at the moment of}} Plattner's return. Deceased was a rate-collector and insurance agent. His widow, who was much younger than himself, married last month a Mr. Whymper, a veterinary surgeon of Allbeeding. As the portion of this story given here has in various forms circulated orally in Sussexville, she has consented to my use of her name, on condition that I make it distinctly known that she emphatically contradicts every detail of Plattner's account of her husband's last moments. She burnt no will, she says, although Plattner never accused her of doing so; her husband made but one will, and that just after their marriage. Certainly, from a man who had never seen it, Plattner's account of the furniture of the room was curiously accurate.|$|E

40|$|Since the mid- 19 th century, many well renowned {{gardening}} {{designers have}} {{argued for the}} introduction of gardening {{as a part of}} the normal <b>school</b> curriculum. Three <b>garden</b> designers that have published handbooks and reports on educational gardening and the design and components of <b>school</b> <b>gardens</b> are Eneroth, Retzius and Lind. The influences and recommendations on <b>school</b> <b>gardens</b> that stem from these publications are worth a closer study. This study has been limited to gardens used for educational purposes in Gotland, Sweden. Both <b>school</b> <b>gardens</b> and gardens for teachers are included in the study, in combination with teachers’ gardens that are used as a part of school curriculum. Archival material has been retrieved directly from archives and registries. Information on the influences and recommendations which dictated the establishment of educational gardens were sourced through the analysis of historical records, literature, and the curriculum and guidelines for educational <b>gardens</b> in <b>schools.</b> Earlier statistical information regarding the educational system has been studied to trace the extent of the use of <b>gardens</b> in <b>school</b> activities. 34 out of the 57 layout designs of educational gardens, which were retrieved from the archives at Arkivcentrum Gotland, are included in this study. Nine of these <b>gardens</b> included <b>school</b> <b>gardens</b> and 25 included gardens for teachers. The results of the study of the educational system statistics shows that Gotland has followed the national school bylaws, and has therefore had a higher implementation of <b>gardening</b> in <b>schools,</b> compared to Sweden nationwide. The study also shows that Eneroths handbooks about <b>school</b> <b>gardens</b> used for educational purposes have had little influence on the actual appearance of <b>school</b> <b>gardens</b> in Gotland. Influences pertaining to the selection of fruit tree varieties can be traced to Eneroth, even though they should have mainly been influenced by Lind, despite many good recommendations by Retzius. It was not possible to determine if either Retzius or Lind have had a stronger influence on berry plants used in Gotlandish <b>school</b> <b>gardens.</b> There is a similar reasoning regarding the layout of <b>school</b> <b>gardens,</b> even though we can conclude that both Retzius and Lind have had a stronger influence than Eneroth. It should however be acknowledged that the layout and design of <b>school</b> <b>gardens</b> in Gotland were only inspired and influenced by, and therefore not directly created from, the recommendations of these gardening designers.

40|$|<b>School</b> <b>gardening</b> {{programmes}} {{are among}} the most promising interventions to improve children’s vegetable intake. Yet, low vegetable intake among children remains a persistent public health challenge. This study aimed to explore children’s perspectives, experiences, and motivations concerning <b>school</b> <b>gardening</b> in order to better understand and increase its potential for health promotion. Using participant observation and semi-structured interviews, we provided 45 primary schoolchildren (9 – 10 years) from Amsterdam, who participated in a comprehensive year-round <b>school</b> <b>gardening</b> programme, the opportunity to share their experiences and ideas on <b>school</b> <b>gardening.</b> Children particularly expressed enjoyment of the outdoor gardening portion of the programme as it enabled them to be physically active and independently nurture their gardens. Harvesting was the children’s favourite activity, followed by planting and sowing. In contrast, insufficient gardening time and long explanations or instructions were especially disliked. Experiencing fun and enjoyment appeared to {{play a vital role in}} children’s motivation to actively participate. Children’s suggestions for programme improvements included more autonomy and opportunities for experimentation, and competition elements to increase fun and variety. Our results indicate that gaining insight into children’s perspectives allows matching <b>school</b> <b>gardening</b> programmes more to children’s wishes and expectations, thereby potentially enhancing their intrinsic motivation for gardening and vegetable consumption...|$|R
