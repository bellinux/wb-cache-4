50|$|Keeping in {{mind that}} bovine <b>somatropin</b> is a protein growth hormone, it can {{increase}} average milk yield anywhere from 10 to 15%, which in turn would lead to cows consuming substantially more nutrients {{in order to keep}} up with the increased milk production. Most of a cow’s energy consumption goes directly towards milk production. In certain areas of the world, like Ethiopia where this was studied extensively, as the cows needed to intake more nutrition to balance out their milk production, there was also an increased level of chemical fertilizers and heavy metal traces found in the milk due to increased exposure to agricultural chemicals. These chemicals can then easily be passed on to humans and lead to a contaminated milk supply. BST increases the longevity or the activity of the mammary cell leading to higher milk production and some other non-desirable side effects.|$|E

At the World Championships, four Chinese swimmers tested positive for the banned substance Triamterene, a diuretic used to dilute urine samples to mask the presence of anabolic steroids.

50|$|Cell CulturesAnimal {{or plant}} cells, removed from tissues, will {{continue}} to grow if cultivated under the appropriate nutrients and conditions. When carried out outside the natural habitat, the process is called cell culture. Mammalian cell culture fermentation, also known as recombinant DNA technology, is used mainly for the production of complex big molecule therapeutic proteins, a.k.a. biopharmaceuticals. The first products made were interferon (discovered in 1957), insulin, and <b>somatropin.</b> Commonly used cell lines are Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells or plant cell cultures. The production volumes are very small. They exceed 100 kg per year for only three products: Rituxan (Roche-Genentech), Enbrel (Amgen and Merck & Co. Wyeth), and Remicade (Johnson & Johnson). Fine chemical production by mammalian cell culture is a much more demanding operation than conventional biocatalysis and -synthesis. The bioreactor batch requires more stringent controls of operating parameters, since mammalian cells are heat and shear sensitive; in addition the growth rate of mammalian cells is very slow, lasting from days to several months. While there are substantial differences between microbial and mammalian technologies (e.g., the volume / value relationships are 10 $/kg and 100 tons for microbial, 1,000,000 $/kg and 10 kilograms for mammalian technology; the cycle times are 2-4 and 10-20 days, respectively), they are even more pronounced between mammalian and synthetic chemical technology (see Table 1).|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} goal is {{to examine}} the lipid spectrum and {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} <b>somatropin</b> therapy for correcting metabolic disorders in children with various forms of short stature. 60 children (30 with growth hormone deficiency and 30 with constitutional delayed growth) have been examined. Total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein in blood serum have been studied before treatment and after one year of <b>somatropin</b> therapy. Atherogenic coefficient has been calculated. The results have been compared with the control group. Dyslipidemia characterized by increase of total cholesterol level (4. 70 ± 1. 51 mmol/l) and low-density lipoprotein (2. 46 ± 1. 04 mmol/l) has been found in children with growth hormone deficiency. 13. 3 % of those children had increased atherogenic coefficient. Increase of low-density lipoprotein level (2. 64 ± 0. 39 mmol/l) and of high-density lipoprotein level (1. 96 ± 0. 56 mmol/l) in children with constitutional delayed growth has been observed.

40|$|Chemical {{modification}} of biomolecules like {{the introduction of}} metal-chelators into proteins can lead to heterogeneous product formation. The nature and extend of the modification is important in interpreting the biological properties of the bioconjugate, given their possible influence on the pharmacokinetics {{as well as on}} the binding affinity to the target. The present study describes the synthesis and analytical characterization of <b>somatropin</b> modified on its lysine’s ε-amino groups with the acylating chelator S- 2 -(4 -isothiocyanatobenzyl) - 1, 4, 7 -triazacyclononane- 1, 4, 7 -triacetic acid (p- SCN-Bn-NOTA). Direct separation and identification techniques (i. e. RP-MS and CE-MS) and peptide mapping after trypsin and chymotrypsin digestion demonstrated that the use of higher amounts of p-SCN-Bn-NOTA during synthesis leads to a complex product composition with higher order substitution degrees (i. e. multiple NOTA-moieties per <b>somatropin</b> molecule), as well as the presence of different position isomers. From the nine lysine (Lys) residues in <b>somatropin,</b> Lys- 70 was experimentally found to be the modification hotspot under our synthesis conditions (pH= 9. 0). This was supported by the in silico calculated lowest pKa value of 8. 3 for Lys- 70. Based on the crystal structure of <b>somatropin</b> in complex with the extracellular parts of the growth hormone receptor, the Lys- 70 residue is positioned outside the binding pockets and will therefore not directly interfere with receptor binding. Gallium chelation by NOTA-somatropin resulted in a 100 % complexation. The synthesis of NOTA-somatropin using p-SCN-Bn-NOTA and <b>somatropin</b> under our operational conditions is therefore a suitable synthesis procedure for the production of a target-specific radiopharmaceutical for further investigation towards treatment and visualization of growth hormonespecific cancers.

40|$|Experimental and {{clinical}} {{studies indicate that}} growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) are involved in heart development. Impaired cardiovascular function, as recently demonstrated, could potentially reduce life expectancy both in GH deficiency (GHD) and excess.

In addition, GHD patients may present {{with an increase in}} vascular intima-media thickness and a higher occurrence of atheromatous plaques that can further aggravate the hemodynamic conditions and contribute to the increased cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk. However, some evidence has been provided to show that cardiovascular abnormalities can be partially reversed after <b>somatropin</b> (recombinant GH) therapy in patients with GHD.

40|$|<b>Somatropin,</b> a {{recombinant}} protein containing 191 amino acids, {{is derived from}} the endogenous human growth hormone, somatotropin. This protein is clinically used in children and adults with inadequate endogenous growth hormone to stimulate a normal bone and muscle growth. In addition, <b>somatropin</b> is recently being investigated for the diagnosis and radiotherapy of certain hormonal cancers. In some of these cancers, over-expression of the human growth hormone receptor (hGHR) is described. The modification of the protein with a chelating agent like NOTA (1, 4, 7 -triazacyclononane- 1, 4, 7 -triacetic acid) allows the inclusion of metals coupled to the protein. The NOTA unit is selectively introduced on a lysine side chain. As site-specific labelling is necessary to avoid active region interactions (1 - 16, 41 - 68, 103 - 119 and 167 - 175), characterization of the chelate-modified <b>somatropin</b> is indispensable. Therefore, we have applied an enzymatic digestion procedure using trypsin, chymotrypsin and a combination of both enzymes. The resulting peptides were then monitored using HPLC-MSn, allowing the investigation of the exact amino acid modifications. The use of a mixture of trypsin and chymotrypsin gave an enhanced information efficiency. Moreover, the intact protein, without enzymatic degradation, was analysed on a protein HPLC column using UV detection for quantification and ESI-MS/MS for characterization. Based upon the HPLC-MSn results of the digested <b>somatropin,</b> the chelating molecule is mainly bound to a specific lysine amino acid that is located away from the receptor binding site. Therefore, the cell-binding functionality of the characterized NOTA-somatropin is measured, using a HepG 2 cell line...|$|E
