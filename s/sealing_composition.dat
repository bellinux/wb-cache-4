A <b>sealing</b> <b>composition</b> containing CRRE with copolymer «STAM» 1 : 2 is more preferable, as in the structure of the copolymer «STAM» contains carboxyl and anhydrite group.

40|$|Titanium and {{titanium}} alloys have an outstanding strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance {{and so are}} materials of choice {{for a variety of}} aerospace and biomedical applications. Such applications are limited by the lack of a viable hermetic glass sealing technology. Conventional silicate sealing glasses are readily reduced by titanium to form interfacial silicides that are incompatible with a robust glass/metal seal. Borate-based glasses undergo a similar thermochemistry and are reduced to a titanium boride. The kinetics of this reactions, however, are apparently slower and so a deleterious interface does not form. Chemically durable lanthanoborate glasses were examined as candidate <b>sealing</b> <b>compositions.</b> The compositions, properties, and structures of several alkaline earth, alumina, and titania lanthanoborate glass forming systems were evaluated and this information was used as the basis for a designed experiment to optimize compositions for Ti-sealing.

40|$|Eltron Research Inc. {{and their}} team members are {{developing}} an environmentally benign, inexpensive, and efficient method for separating hydrogen from gas mixtures produced during industrial processes, such as coal gasification. This project {{was motivated by}} the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) Vision 21 initiative which seeks to economically eliminate environmental concerns {{associated with the use}} of fossil fuels. This objective is being pursued using dense membranes based in part on Eltron-patented ceramic materials with a demonstrated ability for proton and electron conduction. The technical goals are being addressed by modifying single-phase and composite membrane composition and microstructure to maximize proton and electron conductivity without loss of material stability. Ultimately, these materials must enable hydrogen separation at practical rates under ambient and high-pressure conditions, without deactivation in the presence of feedstream components such as carbon dioxide, water, and sulfur. During this quarter, new cermet compositions were tested that demonstrated similar performance to previous materials. A 0. 5 -mm thick membrane achieved at H{sub 2 } transport rate of 0. 2 mL/min/cm{sup 2 } at 950 C, which corresponded to an ambipolar conductivity of 3 x 10 {sup - 3 } S/cm. Although these results were equivalent to those for other cermet compositions, this new composition might be useful if it demonstrates improved chemical or mechanical stability. Ceramic/ceramic composite membranes also were fabricated and tested; however, some reaction did occur between the proton- and electron-conducting phases, which likely compromised conductivity. This sample only achieved a H{sub 2 } transport rate of {approx} 0. 006 mL/min/cm{sup 2 } and an ambipolar conductivity of {approx} 4 x 10 {sup - 4 } S/cm. Chemical stability tests were continued, and candidate ceramic membranes were found to react slightly with carbon monoxide under extreme testing conditions. A cermet compositions did not show any reaction with carbon monoxide, but a thick layer of carbon formed on the membrane surface.

The concretes are intended for sealing segments of deep boreholes and have a small amount of cement for minimizing the mutual chemical impact on the contacting clay <b>seals.</b> The <b>composition</b> is examined by application of packing theory with respect to the cement/aggregate ratio and the gradation of the aggregate material which is crushed quartzite for providing high internal friction after maturation, as well as to talc added for fluidity and to the small amount of cement. Low porosity and micro-structural stability must be guaranteed for very long periods of time. The study exemplifies how packing theory assist designers in selecting optimal proportions of the various components. Optimum particle packing implies minimizing the porosity and thereby reducing the amount of cement paste needed to fill the voids between the aggregate particles.

40|$|In recent years, {{increasing}} scientific {{attention has}} been paid to sea mammals as biological indicators of Arctic environmental change. The usefulness of animals such as ringed seal (Phoca hispida), harp seal (Phoca groenlandica), bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus), and harbour seal (Phoca vitulina) as indicator species is due to the close relationship of their range, reproductive cycles, and life histories to sea ice. The behaviour and distribution of these species correlate with ice conditions in the areas where the animals are encountered. The proportions of seal species represented in archaeological deposits may therefore reflect, at least in part, environmental conditions characterizing past seascapes. This paper examines zooarchaeological data from several Thule and historic Inuit archaeological sites in Baffin Island and Labrador, sites occupied during the last 700 years, to determine whether regional relationships can be demonstrated between subsistence economies, seal populations, and sea ice conditions. Ratios of ringed seal, harbour seal, bearded seal, and walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) bone frequencies from several archaeological sites are analyzed and discussed in light of new highresolution proxy sea ice and regional palaeoenvironmental data. This exploratory study suggests that characteristics in <b>seal</b> species <b>composition</b> reflected in these assemblages can, in some circumstances, be correlated with recent sea ice reconstructions. However, a regional comparison of a larger number of more precisely dated archaeological sites is required for a full examination of these relationships...|$|R

40|$|Work {{has been}} {{conducted}} using a 60 W-cw high power diode laser (HPDL) {{in order to determine}} the feasibility and characteristics of sealing the void between adjoining ceramic tiles with a specially developed grout material having an impermeable enamel surface glaze. A two-stage process has been developed using a new grout material which consists of two distinct components: an amalgamated compound substrate and a glazed enamel surface; the amalgamated compound seal providing a tough, heat resistant bulk substrate, whilst the enamel provides an impervious surface. HPDL processing has resulted in crack free seals produced in normal atmospheric conditions. The basic process phenomena are investigated and the laser effects in terms of <b>seal</b> morphology, <b>composition</b> and microstructure are presented. Also, the resultant heat affects are analysed and described, as well as the effects of the shield gases, O 2 and Ar, during laser processing. Tiles were successfully sealed with power densities as low as 500 W/cm 2 and at rates up to 600 mm/min. Contact angle measurements revealed that due to the wettability characteristics of the amalgamated oxide compound grout (AOCG), laser surface treatment was necessary in order to alter the surface from a polycrystalline to a semi-amorphous structure, thus allowing the enamel to adhere. Bonding of the enamel to the AOCG and the ceramic tiles was identified as being principally due to van der Waals forces, and on a very small scale, some of the base AOCG material dissolving into the glaze...|$|R

40|$|Among {{different}} {{designs of}} solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), planar design {{is the most}} promising due to easier fabrication, improved performance and relatively high power density. In planar SOFCs and other solid-electrolyte devices, gas-tight seals must be formed {{along the edges of}} each cell and between the stack and gas manifolds. For a sealant to work effectively in high-temperature SOFC environment, equilibrium needs to be achieved amid its mechanical properties and flow behavior so that it does not only maintain its hermeticity at high temperature but is also able to reduce mechanical stresses generated in the seal during thermal cycling. The most common sealants based on glass or glass-ceramic materials have been shown to operate in fuel cells for more than 1000 h with no significant degradation. Analysis of the current literature sources demonstrated that from thermal and chemical stability points of view, silicate based glass systems are more suitable than borate and borosilicate glass systems. In this work, different glass-ceramic (GC) compositions based on alkaline- and alkaline-earth aluminosilicate-based glass systems are reviewed with a special emphasis on their thermal, chemical, mechanical, and electrical properties. Based on these considerations, glass composition design approaches are provided that aid in search of the best seal glasses satisfying the rigid functional requirements. Among all the glass systems studied, a pyroxene based CaO-MgO-SrO-BaO-La 2 O 3 -Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 <b>seal</b> GC <b>compositions</b> have been specifically discussed because those have achieved appropriate thermal and chemical properties along with high stability.

40|$|ML modules support {{hierarchical}} namespace management, {{as well as}} both {{abstract and}} transparent type components, {{but they do not}} support recursive linking of separately compiled modules. Mixin modules support recursive linking of separately compiled modules, but they are not hierarchically composable and typically do not contain type components, abstract or otherwise. We synthesize the complementary advantages of these two mechanisms in a new, unified module system design called MixML. A MixML module is like an ML structure in which some of the components are specified but not defined. In other words, it unifies the ML structure and signature languages into one. MixML seamlessly integrates hierarchical composition, translucent data abstraction, and mixin-style recursive linking. The design of MixML is minimalist, emphasizing how superficially distinct features of the ML module system can be modeled as stylized uses of the same underlying constructs, with mixin composition playing a central role.

50|$|Historians {{refer to}} the period around the nineteenth and eighteenth centuries B.C.E. as the Colony Age, before a larger Hittite Kingdom was {{established}} in the region. Groups in settlements of this period included Hattians, Hurrians, and Assyrians living in trading colonies, which the Hittites took control of when they moved into the area. The art style of this time involved assimilation of previous Anatolian symbols and sensibilities. Before this period and during the third millennium, art in ancient Anatolia consisted of rather flat representations of human figures found at burial sites. This was emulated in Hittite ivories like one of a young girl, half seated, cupping her breasts, and wearing a traditional cap. Most of the objects available from the second millennium come in the mediums of carved ivories, baked clay, and small seals. A group of ivories from Acemhöyük, now housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, includes a small sphinx with long curls of hair over its chest that art historians refer to as Hathor curls. As for seals, while there were more traditional cylinder <b>seals,</b> the <b>composition</b> of these Hittite stamp seals did not include a ground-line, and thus the figures are free floating. Deities have been identified such as weather gods who stand on bulls or mountains. This image is repeated in later Imperial rock reliefs. Hittite people of the Colony Age took on and incorporated the motifs from the previous civilizations they asserted control over, mimicking indigenous art styles, including in the depiction of animals such as deer, lions, bulls, and raptors like eagles. A common piece is animal-shaped rhytons, or drinking vessels, which could be sculpted out of clay or later metalwork. The raptors in particular are exceptionally well-shaped.|$|R

40|$|Summary. Goal. To {{investigate}} the phase {{composition of the}} obtained sealing coatings based on aluminophosphate compound (APC) {{and the impact of}} temperature rise on it. Methods. Qualitative X-ray phase analysis (XRPA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) are used as the methods of research. Roentgenograms for structural analysis were obtained on a DRON- 4 - 07 using filtered copper radiation in the secondary beam. Registration and initial processing of diffraction patterns was performed using the software package PDOS with the output of the diffraction patterns on the screen. Using the "loupe" option allowed to identify weak interference lines, which increased the accuracy of the method of qualitative XRPA. The thermograms for DTA received on the device type Termoskan- 2. The results. It is revealed that base of coating is X-ray amorphous phase. There are following crystalline phases: Al, AlPO 4, Al (PO 3) 3, BN found in the coating. It is revealed that annealing doesn’t make a significant influence on the phase composition of the crystalline phases and the coating doesn’t lose properties after annealing during repeated thermal stress. Scientific novelty. The phase composition of the proposed sealing coatings based on APC and produced by plasma spraying, and the effect of annealing on the phase composition of the coating are investigated. The reaction of synthesis of primary material forming on the basis of APC for coating is offered. Practical significance. The results can be used in aviation technology in the development of gas turbine engines (GTE) and the design of the compressors.

However, long-term protection is compromised by the intrinsic porosity and limited range of composition in the PEO layer. A novel approach is to introduce particles to the electrolyte, aiming at their in-situ incorporation into PEO coatings during growth. The idea is that {{with the help of}} particles the defects can be <b>sealed,</b> and the <b>composition</b> range and the functionalities of produced coatings can be enhanced. So far, multifunctional coatings with anticorrosion, self lubrication, anti-wear, bioactive and photocatalytic properties were produced with the aid of particle addition. The properties of particle itself, together with electrical and electrolyte parameters during PEO processing determine the way and efficiency of particle uptake and incorporation into the coatings. Normally incorporation of the particles into the coating can range from fully inert to fully reactive.

40|$|Seals are {{hand-held}} printing blocks {{inscribed with}} some pattern, generally text. They were objects of immense power and prestige in imperial China. This dissertation examines the modern afterlife of inscribed seals {{against the backdrop}} of the decline and collapse of an imperial era order of knowledge and social status, the rise of modern consumer markets and mass culture, and the local accommodation of modern disciplines that promoted new ways of classifying and engaging the material world. In late imperial China (ca. 1600 s- 1800 s), seals legitimized the rule of the emperor and his civil servants and marked the taste and erudition of the literati elite. As hand-held printing blocks that replicated in ink small textual signs, they produced authorizing marks of personhood and office and attracted elite collectors as calligraphic compositions of antiquarian interest. In modern China, seals proliferated within the cosmopolitan material culture of cities like Hangzhou and Shanghai. As the seal was transformed following the disintegration the imperial system, its multifaceted meanings and functions were increasingly subsumed under a monolithic category of "Chinese seal" as art object. The making of the "Chinese seal" as a representative fine art and marker of a distinctive Chinese culture evolved out of the diverse ways in which the carvers, consumers, scholars, and users of seals defined the object's significance in a modern world. This dissertation is thus structured around the new social venues in which the seal emerged in the first four decades of the twentieth century, from the final years of imperial rule through the period of the Nanjing Decade (1927 - 1937). The seal in premodern China was not an unchanging part of a traditional material culture. Its uses and significance had already undergone dramatic, historically contingent, transformations before the twentieth century. Chapter one broadly examines the multifaceted functions of the seal through Chinese history, and explains the emergence of the seal as an object of literati fascination in the late imperial period. The relationship between seal carving and the literati way of life would have to be at least partially displaced for seal carving to survive China's transition to a more mass-oriented society. Chapter two demonstrates how members of the Xiling Seal Society (founded 1904), the first-ever specialized institution devoted to seal carving and inscriptions celebrated literati values of amateurism and exclusivity while simultaneously contributing to the commodification, public visibility, and transformation of literati seal carving. The Xiling Seal Society, as a modern heritage institution based in Hangzhou, had a commercial counterpart in Shanghai with a national and international consumer base. Chapter three uses catalogues of this business and its offshoots as evidence of the crucial role of the market in transmitting and modifying seal carving and related aspects of elite material culture after the collapse of the imperial order. While the Shanghai Xiling Seal Society positioned itself against a vulgarization of seal carving in contemporary society, it incrementally detached the seal from a broader framework of imperial era knowledge production and ultimately marketed it as a customizable commodity suitable to the needs of the modern consumer. Chapters 4 and 5 examine the emerging categorization of the seal as a fine art object. Through an examination of how-to manuals published during the Republican period, chapter 4 focuses on the ways in which practitioners characterized their expertise and how their practical instruction aimed at a general reader marked a transformation of the concept of amateurism. Chapter 5 looks at the seal's incorporation into state-sponsored national exhibitions of fine art held in 1929 and 1937 and the tensions produced by the collision of connoisseurship culture with the mass pedagogy of "aesthetic education. " The categorization of seal carving as fine art can be understood as the grafting of an exogenous classification system onto a local practice. But this new categorization did not only transform the seal, it also transformed the very category of "fine arts" as it was understood in China. The final chapter examines the seal as an object of scholarly inquiry and the relationship between seals, seal carving, and an indigenous field of metal and stone inscription study (jinshi). The second director of the Xiling Seal Society, a scholar named Ma Heng, incorporated seals into his vision of metal and stone inscription study as a sub-discipline of modern historical scholarship. Ma Heng judged seal carving not by the aesthetics of the <b>seal</b> <b>composition,</b> but by the integrity of the archaic text as an accurately rendered play upon epigraphic models. His insistence that seal carving be understood as an expression of scholarship serves as a reminder of how awkwardly imperial era practices of connoisseurship and knowledge production mapped onto a modern field of disciplines, with their hardened boundaries between the arts and the sciences. Today, the Chinese government promotes seal carving as a representative part of an ancient and enduring Chinese culture. As examined in the dissertation's epilogue, the People's Republic of China has succeeded in having "the art of Chinese seal engraving" inscribed on the UNESCO list of intangible cultural heritage of humanity. The seal has now come into the purview of the contemporary state's heritage politics. This has only been possible because the seal proved useful, significant, and accessible to people in the early twentieth century even after the imperial system that had accounted for the object's former prestige was torn asunder...|$|R
40|$|Plasma {{electrolytic}} oxidation (PEO) processing for Mg alloy {{is known for}} decades and has been established as a well-known industrial surface treatment offering a reasonable wear and corrosion protection. However the long-term protection is often limited by the intrinsic porosity and limited phase compositions in the PEO layer. A novel optimization approach is to introduce particles to the PEO electrolyte, aiming at their in-situ incorporation into PEO coatings during growth. The idea is that {{with the help of}} particles the defects can be <b>sealed,</b> and the <b>composition</b> range and the functionalities of produced coatings can be enhanced. The thesis reports the influence of particle addition on PEO processing, how the particle up-take can be controlled and how the morphology, microstructure, phase composition, and properties of PEO coating on Mg alloy are influenced. The mechanisms of uptake and incorporation of particles into PEO layers as well as the coating growth mechanisms are also discussed. It was found that addition of particles cannot avoid/seal fully the high porosity of PEO coatings. Moreover, the growth rate of the coatings is reduced in the presence of particles. The nature of particle itself, together with electrical and electrolyte parameters during the process determine the way and efficiency of particle uptake and incorporation into PEO coatings. The final incorporation of the particles into the coating can range from inert to reactive, which can also be controlled by modifying the processing parameters. Although the corrosion resistance of the coating cannot be significantly improved by the particles, it is feasible to control and modify the biodegradability and compatibility of the coating via addition of particles. Furthermore, multifunctional coatings with anti-wear and photocatalytic properties were produced and it was demonstrated that particle properties can be transferred directly to the coatings...|$|R
40|$|Pathological {{processes}} in the alveolar and facial bones can lead to bone loss that may not heal with complete regeneration. Biomaterials {{can be used to}} facilitate the healing process and/or as a bone substitute, but the mechanisms are not fully understood. Persistent leakage of bacteria/bacterial toxins, after root canal treatment, may lead to a residual bone defect. The healing is dependent on a placed dental biomaterial providing a tight <b>seal.</b> The <b>composition</b> of the filling material may also influence the healing process. The general aim {{of this study is to}} investigate surface properties and biological interactions of biomaterials used in dento-alveolar surgery. A dental biomaterial, a bonded compomer (DAP) containing a corroding glass filler, was used as a root end filling material, promoting a new operation technique. The healing (assessed according to Molven´s x-ray criteria) demonstrates a significant improvement in healing results for the compomer group, compared to a commonly used technique. The surface properties and biological interactions of DAP were analyzed. ICP-OES of DAP cell culture medium extract demonstrated a significant release of Sr, Si and F from the dental biomaterial. Human periodontal ligament (PDL) cells grew on and around DAP specimens without any sign of toxic reactions. DAP extract stimulated proliferation of PDL cells, but caused an inhibition of osteoblastic gene expression in mouse bone marrow cells. The surface properties of the glass containing compomer may contribute to improved healing of the periapical lesions. A bovine inorganic bone graft substitute (BO) is commonly used as a treatment option in dento-alveolar surgery with new bone formation in immediate close contact with BO material. ICP-OES dissolution analysis of cell culture media, after incubation with BO particles, demonstrated a dosedependent release of Si and a decrease of Ca and P. An uptake of Ca from the medium to the BO particle was demonstrated with calcium- 45 labeling. The Si dissolution varied between different batches, possibly reflecting a variation in food intake in the animals. Stimulated osteogenic response was seen in close contact to the BO particles in cell cultures. Furthermore, it was clearly demonstrated that the study design is a critical factor for correctly understanding biomaterials’ biological interactions. The surface properties of three bone graft substitutes reported to have good results in dento-alveolar surgery were investigated, in order to establish whether or not dissolution-precipitation reactions could contribute to the bone healing. Dissolution-precipitation extracts of BO, bioactive glass 45 S 5 (BG) and a marine algae hydroxyl apatite (AP) in cell culture media were analyzed. Dissolution of Si at significant levels was detected for BO and 45 S 5 over time. Significant uptake levels of Ca and P from the culture were seen for both 45 S 5, BO and AP but at different times. Surface analysis of the biomaterials with SEM/EDAX, before and after immersion in cell culture media, revealed a smoothing of the surface morphology for 45 S 5 over time. No obvious alterations for BO and AP were detected. Ca/P ratio decreased significantly for 45 S 5, but no major changes were detected by XPS for BO or AP. XPS further demonstrated a surface charge for BO, changing from negatively to positively charged when exposed to serum. 45 S 5 and AP had positive surface charges, both in the absence and the presence of serum. These demonstrated surface changes in biomaterials could contribute to adherence of cells and subsequently affect bone healing. Conclusion: Biomaterials used in dento-alveolar surgery interact with biological surroundings through surface and dissolution-precipitation reactions which may have implications for bone healing...|$|R

Inscription: 集張公方碑以景君筆法為之。定瀚仁兄法家正之。清道人 Translation: Written after Zhanggong’s stele and Jingjun’s brush style. For my dear friend Dinghan to correct. Signed Qing Daoren [an alternate name of Li Ruiqing, which means a man loyal to the Qing dynasty. ]Artist's Seal: 阿梅 A’mei, 清道人 Qing dao ren, 黃龍硯齋 Huanglong yanzhai (yellow dragon inkstone studio), 炳焉與三代同風Li Ruiqing (1867 - 1920, alternative name Zhonglin, 仲麟; Mei’an, 梅庵) studied calligraphy from Han dynasty epigraphy and inscriptions from Shang and Zhou dynasty bronzes since he was young. This pair of couplet scrolls, as the calligrapher said himself, wrritten after Zhanggong’s stele and Jingjun’s brush style. Zhanggong’s stele may refer to the Zhang Qian stele (Zhang Qian bei 張遷碑, which is a well-known stele created in 186, the Eastern Han period to commemorate Zhang Qian’s deeds. Now the stele is preserved at the Temple of Dai (daimiao 岱廟) in Tai’an, Shandong. The writings from Zhang Qian stele present a flavor of clerical style. But the composition is more square and longer, yet still maintaining features from seal script which was popular in an earlier period. The strokes and turning points also end with a square shape, which is different from round and smooth ending in the mature clerical script. The clumsy and naïve characters are admired by later calligraphers. “Zhanggong” literally means Mr. Zhang. Since Li Ruiqing did not specify who Mr. Zhang was, {{it is hard to}} prove that Zhanggong’s stele is the same one as the Zhang Qian stele. Jingjun stele is another famous Han stele dating to 143. Similar to Zhang Qian stele, Jingjun stele also suggests the style derived from <b>seal</b> script. The <b>composition</b> of each character is long and slender. Like the styles in these two steles, Li Ruiqing’s calligraphy is not as flat as normal clerical script. The two separate parts of the last character on the left scroll, ya (elegant), look very slim respect comparatively. But with the enlarged space between the two parts, the entire character still maintains a relatively square shape. The same strategy can be also found in the character of jie (joint), the second one on the right scroll. This indicates the influence from seal script when he studied calligraphy. The trembling strokes suggest Li Ruiqing’s intention to control the brush and create an affect that is similar to the carving on the stone. Li Ruiqing also was known for writing big and powerful characters. An important calligrapher in Chinese history, Li Ruiqing was also a significant education reformer in the late Qing period. He was a pioneer who supported art education in higher school. After the Qing dynasty fell, he was still loyal to the imperial court and started to wear Daoist robes. He also named himself Qing Daoren, which means a Daoist who came from Qing dynasty. In this calligraphic work, he signed this name at the end. Reference Hummel, Arthur W. ed.
