25|$|BIOPAN is a {{multi-user}} experimental facility {{installed on}} the external surface of the Russian Foton descent capsule. Experiments developed for BIOPAN are designed to investigate {{the effect of the}} space environment on biological material after exposure between 13 and 17 days. The experiments in BIOPAN are exposed to solar and cosmic radiation, the <b>space</b> <b>vacuum</b> and weightlessness, or a selection thereof. Of the 6 missions flown so far on BIOPAN between 1992 and 2007, dozens of experiments were conducted, and some analyzed the likelihood of panspermia. Some bacteria, lichens (Xanthoria elegans, Rhizocarpon geographicum and their mycobiont cultures, the black Antarctic microfungi Cryomyces minteri and Cryomyces antarcticus), spores, and even one animal (tardigrades) were found to have survived the harsh outer space environment and cosmic radiation.|$|E
