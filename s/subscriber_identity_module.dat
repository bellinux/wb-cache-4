The two modes are exclusive in a given communication session, and most cards are built with support for a single mode. Microprocessor-based contact Smart Cards are mostly of the asynchronous variety, used for all <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Identity</b> <b>Modules</b> (SIM) for mobile phones, those bank cards with contacts that conform to EMV specifications, all contact Java Cards, and Smart Cards for pay television.

40|$|Given the {{diffusion}} of cellular phones and WLANs, using mobile phones as authentication devices to allow a mobile terminal (laptop, PDA or PC) to log into a WLAN network would be an easy and secure means for final users. Wireless Service Providers are proposing solutions that exploit GSM <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Identity</b> <b>Modules</b> (SIMs) for network authentication, but the proposed solutions require buying ad-hoc SIM cards and separate smart card readers, {{without being able to}} exploit mobile phones. In this paper we provide a way to override the requirement of additonal SIM and hardware by defining a mechanism and a corresponding interface so that a mobile terminal can use a mobile phone and its stored SIM credentials to get authenticated into an Open Access Network layered on top of a WLAN. The solution proposed in this paper exploits the EAP-SIM [5] authentication protocol that provides the authentication steps and defines the information needed to authenticate a client by the credentials retrieved from a SIM card. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract â€“ <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Identity</b> <b>Modules</b> (SIMs) are a {{fundamental}} standardized component of most cell phones used worldwide. A SIM {{can be removed}} from a phone handset and inserted into another, allowing users to port identity, personal information, and service between devices. All cell phones are expected to incorporate some type of <b>identity</b> <b>module</b> eventually, in part, because of this useful property. Some of the earliest, general purpose, forensic tools for cell phones targeted SIMs to recover digital evidence. While over time the capabilities and number of such tools have increased, they are not completely free of problems. Validating a forensic SIM tool is an essential quality assurance measure. It allows a forensic specialist {{to determine how to}} compensate for any shortcomings identified or whether to use one version of the tool in lieu of another. Tool manufacturers also benefit from rigorously validating their products before releasing them. However, creating reference SIMs that contain comprehensive test data can be time consuming and difficult to accomplish. This paper describes an approach for automating the population of test data onto SIMs to create reference material for use in tool validation. It also covers details of the implementation and explains characteristics of SIMs that pertain to the solution...|$|R
40|$|When {{using the}} web, long {{response}} times are bones of contention for users, i. e. they damp the Quality of Experience (QoE). Though, if {{one knows the}} cause of the long response time one may examine what could be done to eliminate the obstacle. In this paper, we determine the weak point of the Extensible Authentication Protocol Method for GSM <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Identity</b> <b>Modules</b> (EAP-SIM) with the OpenID service with regards to excessive authentication times, which determine the response times. In order to provoke controlled increases of the latter, we emulate bad network performance by introducing bi-directional delay between the supplicant (client) and the authentication server. The same procedure is also applied to several other EAP methods. Based on a recent, exponential relationship between QoE and response time, we then identify, quantify and compare the decisive factors for QoE reduction as functions of the components of the authentication times. The results we obtain clearly show that one task of the EAP-SIM authentication contributes significantly more to the total response times than the other tasks, which points out the direction for future optimisation of user perception of authentication times.

40|$|Authentication {{solutions}} {{are designed to}} stop unauthorized users from getting access to a secured system. However, each time an authentication process occur an authorized user needs to wait in expectation of approved access. This effort can be perceived as either a positive or negative experience. If the effort {{is perceived as a}} security measure; the effort is usually perceived as a positive experience. On the other hand, if the effort is perceived as a waiting time; the effort is usually perceived as a negative experience. The trade-off between security, user-friendliness and simplicity {{plays an important role in}} the domain of user acceptability. From the users' point of view, security is both necessary and disturbing at the same time. The overall focus in this thesis is on user perception of authentication in communication networks. An authentication procedure, or login, normally includes several steps and messages between a client and a server. In addition, the connection could suffer from low Quality of Service, i. e., each step in the authentication process will add to a longer response time. The longer response times will then infer lower Quality of Experience, i. e., a worse user perception. The thesis first presents a concept of investigating user perception. A framework is developed in which different criteria and evaluation methods for authentication schemes are presented. This framework is then used to investigate user perception of the response times of a web authentication procedure. The derived result, which is an exponential function, is compared to models for user perception of web performance. The comparison indicates that users perceive logins similarly, but not identically, to how they perceive standard web page loading. The user perception, with regards to excessive authentication times, is further studied by determining the weak point of the Extensible Authentication Protocol Method for GSM <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Identity</b> <b>Modules</b> (EAPSIM) with the OpenID service. The response times are controllably increased by emulating bad network performance for EAP-SIM and other EAP methods in live setups. The obtained results show that one task of the EAP-SIM authentication deviates from the other tasks, and contributes more to the total response time. This deviation points out the direction for future optimization. Finally, this thesis investigates how users of social networks perceive security, and to which extent they contribute to it. One way of contributing to security by creating and using strong authentication credentials, e. g. passwords. Websites might enforce a password length which is insufficient to provide a strong password. This might then cause problems by giving users a false perception of what constitutes a strong password. The origin of the password problem, namely the construction of passwords, and the user perception of password security is studied. A survey is conducted and the results indicate that the passwords of the respondents are not as strong as the respondents perceive them to be...|$|R
