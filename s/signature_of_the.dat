5|$|The Gideon Gono {{series of}} 2004 carried the <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{incumbent}} Reserve Bank governor, Dr. Gideon Gono {{and consisted of}} only one denomination of the first dollar ($500). This was the last series of regular banknotes of the first dollar, as hyperinflation forced all regular banknotes series out of use, although remaining legal tender theoretically until 21 August 2006.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of discovery, Gliese 876 was already known to host an extrasolar planet {{designated}} Gliese 876 b. In 2001, further analysis of the star's radial velocity revealed {{the existence of a}} second planet in the system, which was designated Gliese 876 c. The orbital period of Gliese 876 c was found to be exactly half that of the outer planet, which meant that the radial velocity <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second planet was initially interpreted as a higher eccentricity of the orbit of Gliese 876 b.|$|E
5|$|For many years, Germany {{simply had}} no battleships. The Armistice with Germany {{required}} {{that most of}} the High Seas Fleet be disarmed and interned in a neutral port; largely because no neutral port could be found, the ships remained in British custody in Scapa Flow, Scotland. The Treaty of Versailles specified that the ships should be handed over to the British. Instead, most of them were scuttled by their German crews on June 21, 1919 just before the <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peace treaty. The treaty also limited the German Navy, and prevented Germany from building or possessing any capital ships.|$|E

5|$|In {{the tail}} end of the 1990s, due to the parts being discontinued, the 3/5 had {{technically}} reached the end of the road. Some licensees continued to make small numbers of speakers, for a while, using re-manufactured parts. However, Stirling Broadcast, one of the last batch of licensees, completely redesigned the product based on the audio <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original, and launched the LS3/5A v2 with the full endorsement of the broadcaster in early 2006.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the move from Zeus to Nike-X was concern that the Zeus radars would not be able to tell the {{difference}} between the warhead and a decoy until it was too late to launch. One solution to this problem was the Sprint missile, which had the performance required to wait until decluttering was complete. Another potential solution was to look for some sort of <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reentry through the highest levels of the atmosphere that might differ between a warhead and decoy; specifically, it appeared that the ablation of the heat shield might produce a clear signature pointing out the warhead.|$|E
5|$|Signatures are {{received}} at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City by authorized {{representatives of the}} state.

The instrument is deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations.|$|E

5|$|The Standard Chartered {{series was}} a series of {{emergency}} bearer cheques issued by the Standard Chartered Bank (hence the title on the top of these cheques) and the Cargill Cotton Group. They were authorised by the Reserve Bank as legitimate issues and were valid for six months from the date of issue, the first currency notes of the Zimbabwean dollar to have a time limit. They carry the <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company's finance director Priscilla Mutenbwa and operations director Stephen Newton-Howes.|$|E
5|$|The notes had 150 minor marks that {{acted as}} {{security}} measures to identify forgeries. These were often {{assumed to be}} printing errors, and were changed between issues of notes. Each note bore an alphanumeric serial designation and the <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chief Cashier of the Bank of England. Prior {{to the release of}} any notes by the Bank of England, all serial numbers were recorded in ledgers so the bank could verify its liabilities; these numbers were checked when the notes circulated back through the bank.|$|E
5|$|As intended, {{it would}} have functioned as a stealth helicopter, {{incorporating}} {{a number of different}} techniques and technologies in order to reduce its radar cross-section (RCS) along with other areas of visibility and detectability. The exterior surfaces of the RAH-66 were faceted and covered with both radar-absorbent material (RAM) coatings and infrared-suppressant paint; {{as a result of these}} combined measures, the Comanche's RCS was claimed to have been 360 times smaller than that of the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter. The acoustic <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rotorcraft was also reported to be noticeably lower than comparative helicopters; this reduction had been partially achieved through the adoption of an all-composite five-blade main rotor and pioneering canted tail rotor assembly.|$|E

5|$|Independently of {{the method}} used to signify royal assent, it is the {{responsibility}} of the Clerk of the Parliaments, once the assent has been duly notified to both houses, not only to endorse the act in the name of the monarch with the formal Norman French formula, but to certify that assent has been granted. The clerk signs one authentic copy of the bill and inserts the date (in English) on which the assent was notified to the two houses after the title of the act. When an act is published, the <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clerk is omitted, as is the Norman French formula, should the endorsement have been made in writing. However, the date on which the assent was notified is printed in brackets.|$|E
5|$|Lefkada, {{part of the}} Despotate of Epirus {{since the}} latter's {{foundation}} in 1205, was incorporated by Leonardo I Tocco into the County of Cephalonia in 1362. The Despotate of Epirus {{was one of the}} three Byzantine Empires in exile created after the Fourth Crusade in 1204. Following the fate of the other central Ionian Islands, it was captured by the Turks in 1479 and then by the Venetians in 1502. However, Venetian rule did not last, as Lefkada was given back to the Ottoman Empire one year later. Turkish rule over Lefkada lasted for over 200 years, from 1479 to 1684, when Francesco Morosini attacked and subdued the island during the Morean War. Lefkada, however, did not become officially Venetian until 1718, with the <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Treaty of Passarowitz.|$|E
5|$|The German army {{attacked}} Russia on 18 February. The offensive {{led to a}} rapid {{collapse and}} retreat of the Russian troops and to <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first Treaty of Brest-Litovsk by the Bolsheviks on 3 March 1918. Finland, the Baltic countries, Poland and Ukraine were transferred to the German power sphere. The Civil War of the Finns opened an easy access with low costs to Fennoscandia, where the geopolitical status altered as a British Naval squadron invaded the harbour of Murmansk on the northwestern coast of Russia by the Arctic Ocean on 9 March 1918. General Erich Ludendorff wanted both to chain Petrograd through Narva - Viipuri and German-led monarchy for Finland.|$|E
