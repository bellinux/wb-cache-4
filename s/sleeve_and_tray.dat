40|$|Background: Tibial {{fixation}} of hamstring tendon grafts {{has been}} the weak link in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Hypothesis: Use of a central four-quadrant <b>sleeve</b> <b>and</b> screw provides superior fixation when compared with standard interference screw fixation. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: In eight pairs of cadaveric knees each anterior cruciate ligament was reconstructed using either an interference screw or a central <b>sleeve</b> <b>and</b> screw on the tibial side. The specimens were then subjected to cyclic loading followed by a load-to-failure test. Results: The load required to cause 1 and 2 mm of graft laxity, defined as {{the separation of the}} femur and the tibia at the points of graft fixation, was significantly greater with the <b>sleeve</b> <b>and</b> screw than with the interference screw (at 2 mm: <b>sleeve</b> <b>and</b> screw, 216. 1 30. 1 N; interference screw, 167. 0 33. 2 N). The force at initial slippage for each of the graft strands was significantly higher with use of the central <b>sleeve</b> <b>and</b> screw. Conclusions: The four-quadrant <b>sleeve</b> <b>and</b> screw device may provide greater surface area for healing of hamstring tendon grafts and allow equal tensioning of graft strands before fixation. These factors are associated with increased strength of fixation and reduced laxity of the graft after cyclic loading. Clinical Relevance: Use of the central four-quadrant <b>sleeve</b> <b>and</b> screw system offers increased strength of fixation in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with hamstring tendon graft...|$|R
