5|$|The major {{function}} of the parathyroid glands is to maintain the body's calcium and phosphate levels within a very narrow range, so that the nervous and muscular systems can function properly. The parathyroid glands do this by <b>secreting</b> parathyroid hormone.|$|E
5|$|Albatrosses, {{along with}} all Procellariiformes, must excrete the salts they ingest in {{drinking}} sea water and eating marine invertebrates. All birds have an enlarged nasal gland {{at the base of}} the bill, above their eyes. This gland is inactive in species that do not require it, but in the Procellariiformes it acts as a salt gland. Scientists are uncertain as to its exact processes, but do know in general terms that it removes salt by <b>secreting</b> a 5% saline solution that drips out of their nose or is forcibly ejected.|$|E

40|$|Islet cells tumours are a {{range of}} rare {{neoplasms}} of neuroendocrine origin arising in or close to the pancreas. The normal islet cells of Langerhans in the pancreas contain B-cells (which <b>secrete</b> insulin), A-cells (which <b>secrete</b> glucagon), D-cells (which <b>secrete</b> somatostatin), D 1 -cells (which <b>secrete</b> pancreatic polypeptide) and D 2 -cells (which <b>secrete</b> vasoactive intestinal peptide). The majority (85 %) of islet cell tumours <b>secrete</b> {{one or more of}} these hormones, or other substances not normally found in the adult pancreas (although often present in the foetal pancreas), notably gastrin...|$|R
50|$|Gastric {{juice is}} <b>secreted</b> from gastric glands, which {{are located in}} narrow tube like {{structures}} called gastric pits. Gastric juice contains hydrochloric acid, pepsinogen and mucus in a healthy adult. Hydrochloric acid is <b>secreted</b> by parietal cells, pepsinogen is <b>secreted</b> by gastric chief cells and mucus is <b>secreted</b> by mucus neck cells.|$|R
5|$|Clearly, some tumors {{evade the}} immune system and go on to become cancers. Tumor cells often have a reduced number of MHC class I {{molecules}} on their surface, thus avoiding detection by killer T cells. Some tumor cells also release products that inhibit the immune response; for example by <b>secreting</b> the cytokine TGF-β, which suppresses the activity of macrophages and lymphocytes. In addition, immunological tolerance may develop against tumor antigens, so {{the immune system}} no longer attacks the tumor cells.|$|E
5|$|Exocytosis in prokaryotes: Membrane {{vesicular}} exocytosis, {{popularly known}} as membrane vesicle trafficking, a Nobel prize-winning (year, 2013) process, is traditionally regarded as a prerogative of eukaryotic cells. This myth was however broken with the revelation that nanovesicles, {{popularly known as}} bacterial outer membrane vesicles, released by gram-negative microbes, translocate bacterial signal molecules to host or target cells to carry out multiple processes in favour of the <b>secreting</b> microbe e.g., in host cell invasion and microbe-environment interactions, in general.|$|E
5|$|In larval lampreys, {{the thyroid}} {{originates}} as an exocrine gland, <b>secreting</b> its hormones into the gut, and {{associated with the}} larva's filter-feeding apparatus. In the adult lamprey, the gland separates from the gut, and becomes endocrine, but this path of development may reflect the evolutionary origin of the thyroid. For instance, the closest living relatives of vertebrates, the tunicates and Amphioxus, have a structure {{very similar to that}} of larval lampreys (the endostyle), and this also secretes iodine-containing compounds (albeit not thyroxine).|$|E
5000|$|The {{ability of}} a T3SS to <b>secrete</b> a {{specific}} protein or to <b>secrete</b> at all. In order to assay this, secretion is induced in bacteria growing in liquid medium. The bacteria and medium are then separated by centrifugation, and the medium fraction (the supernatant) is then assayed {{for the presence of}} <b>secreted</b> proteins. In order to prevent a normally <b>secreted</b> protein from being <b>secreted,</b> a large molecule can be artificially attached to it. If the then non-secreted protein stays [...] "stuck" [...] {{at the bottom of the}} needle complex, the secretion is effectively blocked.|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time, sodium ions are {{actively}} reabsorbed. This {{means that the}} majority of <b>secreted</b> K+ and Na+ ions return to the cytoplasm. In the canaliculus, <b>secreted</b> hydrogen and chloride ions mix and are <b>secreted</b> into the lumen of the oxyntic gland.|$|R

5|$|In many vertebrates, the {{esophagus}} is lined by stratified squamous epithelium without glands. In fish, {{the esophagus}} is often lined with columnar epithelium, and in amphibians, sharks and rays, the esophageal epithelium is ciliated, helping to wash food along, {{in addition to}} the action of muscular peristalsis. In addition, in the bat Plecotus auritus, fish and some amphibians, glands <b>secreting</b> pepsinogen or hydrochloric acid have been found.|$|E
5|$|Most platyhelminths have no anus and regurgitate undigested {{material}} {{through the}} mouth. However, some long species have an anus and some with complex, branched guts {{have more than}} one anus, since excretion only through the mouth would be difficult for them. The gut is lined with a single layer of endodermal cells that absorb and digest food. Some species break up and soften food first by <b>secreting</b> enzymes in the gut or pharynx (throat).|$|E
5|$|The {{innermost}} {{layer of}} the heart is called the endocardium. It {{is made up of}} a lining of simple squamous epithelium, and covers heart chambers and valves. It is continuous with the endothelium of the veins and arteries of the heart, and is joined to the myocardium with a thin layer of connective tissue. The endocardium, by <b>secreting</b> endothelins, may also play a role in regulating the contraction of the myocardium.|$|E
50|$|Many {{human cell}} types {{have the ability}} to be {{secretory}} cells. They have a well-developed endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus to fulfill their function. Tissues in humans that produce secretions include the gastrointestinal tract which <b>secretes</b> digestive enzymes and gastric acid, the lung which <b>secretes</b> surfactants, and sebaceous glands which <b>secrete</b> sebum to lubricate the skin and hair. Meibomian glands in the eyelid <b>secrete</b> sebum to lubricate and protect the eye.|$|R
40|$|Follistatin (FST) and FST-like- 3 (FSTL 3) are {{structurally}} related {{proteins that}} bind and neutralize activin and closely related {{members of the}} TGF � superfamily. Three FST isoforms (FST 288, FST 303, and FST 315) are produced from the Fst gene that are primarily <b>secreted</b> proteins. FSTL 3 is <b>secreted,</b> but is also observed within the nucleus of most cells. We used pulse-chase 35 S labeling to examine the biosynthetic and intracellular transport patterns that lead to differential secretion and intracellular retention of these proteins. Among the FST isoforms, FST 315 was <b>secreted</b> fastest and FST 288 was <b>secreted</b> more slowly, with some remaining intracellular. In contrast, FSTL 3 was <b>secreted</b> the slowest, with newly synthesized proteins being both <b>secreted</b> and trafficked to the nucleus. This nuclear FSTL 3 was N-glycosylated, although not {{to the same degree}} as <b>secreted</b> FSTL 3. Both FST and FSTL 3 hav...|$|R
50|$|They {{give rise}} to both the {{endocrine}} and exocrine cells. Exocrine cells constitute the acinar cells and the ductal cells. The endocrine cells constitute the beta cells which make insulin, alpha cells which <b>secrete</b> glucagon, delta cells which <b>secrete</b> somatostatin and the PP-cells which <b>secrete</b> pancreatic polypeptide.|$|R
5|$|The main {{pathological}} {{characteristics of}} PD are cell {{death in the}} brain's basal ganglia (affecting up to 70% of the dopamine <b>secreting</b> neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta {{by the end of}} life) and the presence of Lewy bodies (accumulations of the protein alpha-synuclein) in many of the remaining neurons. This loss of neurons is accompanied by the death of astrocytes (star-shaped glial cells) and {{a significant increase in the}} number of microglia (another type of glial cell) in the substantia nigra.|$|E
5|$|The {{milk fat}} globule is {{surrounded}} by a phospholipid trilayer containing associated proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids derived primarily from the membrane of the <b>secreting</b> mammary epithelial cell (lactocyte). This trilayer is collectively known as MFGM. While MFGM only makes up an estimated 2% to 6% of the total milk fat globule, it is an especially rich phospholipid source, accounting for the majority of total milk phospholipids. In contrast, the inner core of the milk fat globule is composed predominantly of triacylglycerols.|$|E
5|$|These {{processes}} {{are also important}} in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are {{largely responsible for the}} production of the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Non-respiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, <b>secreting</b> metabolic by-products (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste. Facultative anaerobes can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves.|$|E
50|$|Neurophysins are carrier {{proteins}} which {{transport the}} hormones oxytocin and vasopressin to the posterior pituitary from the paraventricular and supraoptic {{nucleus of the}} hypothalamus, respectively. Neurophysins are <b>secreted</b> from the hypothalamus along with their passenger hormones.It appears the neurophysins are parts of the precursor molecules.They are <b>secreted</b> from the posterior pituitary with their associated hormone (in the case of vasopressin, a glycopeptide is also <b>secreted).</b> The functions of the <b>secreted</b> neurophysin is unknown.|$|R
40|$|Proteins <b>secreted</b> by Trichinella spiralis have a {{potential}} role in remodelling host skeletal muscle. However, whilst many parasite-secreted proteins have been identified, it {{has rarely been}} demonstrated that these are <b>secreted</b> into the nurse cell. Using an informatics-based analysis, we have searched the T. spiralis expressed sequence tag (EST) datasets for cDNAs encoding potential <b>secreted</b> proteins. Here we describe the characterisation {{of three of the}} top candidates isolated from our analysis, termed <b>secreted</b> from muscle stage larvae (SML) - 1, - 2 and - 3. All three proteins were demonstrated to be <b>secreted</b> by muscle stage larvae, and immunohistochemical analysis established that SML- 1 and - 2 are <b>secreted</b> into developing nurse cells. We also show that SML- 2 is processed from a precursor into smaller peptides by a metalloprotease contained within T. spiralis-secreted products. With the identification of these and other <b>secreted</b> proteins, we now have molecules to test in functional assays designed to dissect molecular features of the developing nurse cell...|$|R
40|$|The {{action of}} <b>secreted</b> phospholipases A 2 in skin {{is thought to}} be {{essential}} for epidermal barrier homeostasis. The incomplete knowledge of presence and functions of the novel <b>secreted</b> phospholipase A 2 subtypes in skin prompted us to explore their expression in epidermis and primary keratinocytes from murine neonatal skin. We detected <b>secreted</b> phospholipases A 2 -IB, -IIA, -IIC, -IID, -IIE, -IIF, -V, -X, and -XII. To study <b>secreted</b> phospholipase A 2 expression during epidermal differentiation, primary keratinocytes from the basal, suprabasal, and upper differentiated layers of neonatal mouse epidermis were obtained by density gradient centrifugation. mRNA for <b>secreted</b> phospholipases A 2 -IB, -IIE, -IIF, -V, and -XII- 1 are mainly expressed in the upper differentiated layers, whereas the most prominent enzymes in the basal and suprabasal layers are <b>secreted</b> phospholipases A 2 -IIA, -IID, and -X. The mRNA for <b>secreted</b> phospholipase A 2 -IIC was found in all fractions. Immunohistochemical analysis in mouse skin sections reflected the mRNA distribution patterns in the different epidermal cell fractions. After in vitro induction of keratinocyte differentiation by increasing the calcium concentration of the medium, <b>secreted</b> phospholipases A 2 -IB, -IIE, -IIF, -V, and -XII- 1 were upregulated, whereas <b>secreted</b> phospholipases A 2 -IIA, -IIC, -IID, and -X were mainly expressed in proliferating keratinocytes. The specific <b>secreted</b> phospholipase A 2 expression profile in the skin suggests a distinct function for each enzyme in the epidermis...|$|R
5|$|Relatively new {{cells in}} a groove {{on the edges}} of the mantle secrete {{material}} that extends the periostracum. These cells are gradually displaced to the underside of the mantle by more recent cells in the groove, and switch to <b>secreting</b> the mineralized material of the shell valves. In other words, {{on the edge of the}} valve the periostracum is extended first, and then reinforced by extension of the mineralized layers under the periostracum. In most species the edge of the mantle also bears movable bristles, often called chaetae or setae, that may help defend the animals and may act as sensors. In some brachiopods groups of chaetae help to channel the flow of water into and out of the mantle cavity.|$|E
5|$|The {{digestive}} system of beetles is primarily adapted for a herbivorous diet. Digestion takes place {{mostly in the}} anterior midgut, although in predatory groups like the Carabidae, most digestion occurs in the crop by means of midgut enzymes. In the Elateridae, the larvae are liquid feeders that extraorally digest their food by <b>secreting</b> enzymes. The alimentary canal basically consists of a short, narrow pharynx, a widened expansion, the crop, and a poorly developed gizzard. This {{is followed by the}} midgut, that varies in dimensions between species, with a large amount of cecum, and the hindgut, with varying lengths. There are typically four to six Malpighian tubules.|$|E
5|$|The gastrovascular cavity {{itself is}} divided {{into a number of}} {{chambers}} by mesenteries radiating inwards from the body wall. Some of the mesenteries form complete partitions with a free edge {{at the base of the}} pharynx, where they connect, but others reach only partway across. The mesenteries are usually found in multiples of twelve, and are symmetrically arranged around the central lumen. They have stomach lining on both sides, separated by a thin layer of mesoglea, and include filaments of tissue specialised for <b>secreting</b> digestive enzymes. In some species, these filaments extend below the lower margin of the mesentery, hanging free in the gastrovascular cavity as thread-like acontial filaments. These acontia are armed with nematocysts and can be extruded through cinclides, blister-like holes in the wall of the column, for use in defence.|$|E
50|$|Keratinocytes in skin {{make and}} <b>secrete</b> MSH in {{response}} to ultraviolet light, where it increases synthesis of melanin. Some neurons in arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus make and <b>secrete</b> α-MSH {{in response to}} leptin; α-MSH is also made and <b>secreted</b> in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland.|$|R
40|$|Similarly to {{microbial}} pathogens, plant-parasitic nematodes <b>secrete</b> {{into their}} host plants proteins {{that are essential}} to establish a functional interaction. Identifying the destination of nematode <b>secreted</b> proteins within plant cell compartment(s) will provide compelling clues on their molecular functions. Here the fine localization of five nematode <b>secreted</b> proteins was analysed throughout parasitism in Arabidopsis thaliana. An immunocytochemical method was developed that preserves both the host and the pathogen tissues, allowing the localization of nematode <b>secreted</b> proteins within both organisms. One <b>secreted</b> protein from the amphids and three <b>secreted</b> proteins from the subventral oesophageal glands involved in protein degradation and cell wall modification were <b>secreted</b> in the apoplasm during intercellular migration and to a lower extent by early sedentary stages during giant cell formation. Conversely, another protein produced by both subventral and dorsal oesophageal glands in parasitic stages accumulated profusely at the cell wall of young and mature giant cells. In addition, secretion of cell wall-modifying proteins by the vulva of adult females suggested a role in egg laying. The study shows that the plant apoplasm acts as an important destination compartment for proteins <b>secreted</b> during migration and during sedentary stages of the nematod...|$|R
40|$|It was {{demonstrated}} that imbibed and germinated seeds of buckwheat Fagopyrum esculentum <b>secrete</b> protease inhibitors into environmental medium. The type of the inhibitors <b>secreted</b> {{depended on the}} state of the seed. It was found that imbibed buckwheat seeds <b>secreted</b> only trypsin inhibitors, while germinated seeds <b>secreted</b> a wide range of inhibitors- towards trypsin, chymotrypsin and bacterial subtilisin. Buckwheat seeds with a damaged seed coat <b>secreted</b> greater amounts of inhibitors towards trypsin, chymotrypsin and subtilisin. It is proposed that diffusion of protein protease inhibitors functions as a mechanism of formation of a defense barrier in plants during seed germination or at contact with a pathogen...|$|R
5|$|The {{success of}} any {{pathogen}} {{depends on its}} ability to elude host immune responses. Therefore, pathogens evolved several methods that allow them to successfully infect a host, while evading detection or destruction by the immune system. Bacteria often overcome physical barriers by <b>secreting</b> enzymes that digest the barrier, for example, by using a type II secretion system. Alternatively, using a type III secretion system, they may insert a hollow tube into the host cell, providing a direct route for proteins to move from the pathogen to the host. These proteins are often used to shut down host defenses.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{enters the}} body through the {{digestive}} tract. A transporter protein on {{the cells of}} the small bowel, copper membrane transporter 1 (Ctr1; SLC31A1), carries copper inside the cells, where some is bound to metallothionein and part is carried by ATOX1 to an organelle known as the trans-Golgi network. Here, in response to rising concentrations of copper, an enzyme called ATP7A releases copper into the portal vein to the liver. Liver cells also carry the CMT1 protein, and metallothionein and ATOX1 bind it inside the cell, but here it is ATP7B that links copper to ceruloplasmin and releases it into the bloodstream, as well as removing excess copper by <b>secreting</b> it into bile. Both functions of ATP7B are impaired in Wilson's disease. Copper accumulates in the liver tissue; ceruloplasmin is still secreted, but in a form that lacks copper (termed apoceruloplasmin) and is rapidly degraded in the bloodstream.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause is}} not entirely clear, but {{is thought to be}} multifactorial. It has even been {{suggested}} that aphthous stomatitis is not a single entity but rather a group of conditions with different causes. Multiple research studies have attempted to identify a causative organism, but aphthous stomatitis appears to be non-contagious, non-infectious and not sexually transmissible. The mucosal destruction is thought {{to be the result of}} a T cell (T lymphocyte) mediated immune response which involves the generation of interleukins and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Mast cells and macrophages are also involved, <b>secreting</b> TNF-α along with the T cells. When early aphthous ulcers are biopsied, the histologic appearance shows a dense inflammatory infiltrate, 80% of which is made up of T cells. Persons with aphthous stomatitis also have circulating lymphocytes which react with peptides 91–105 of heat shock protein 65–60, and the ratio of CD4+ T cells to CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood of individuals with aphthous stomatitis is decreased.|$|E
50|$|The {{apocrine gland}} <b>secretes</b> an oily fluid with proteins, lipids, and steroids that is odorless before {{microbial}} activity. It {{appears on the}} skin surface mixed with sebum, as sebaceous glands open into the same hair follicle. Unlike eccrine sweat glands, which <b>secrete</b> continuously, the apocrine glands <b>secrete</b> in periodic spurts.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The {{hypothalamus}} <b>secretes</b> CRH, which {{directs the}} pituitary gland to <b>secrete</b> ACTH. In turn, ACTH directs {{the adrenal cortex}} to <b>secrete</b> glucocorticoids, such as cortisol. The GCs then reduce the rate of secretion by the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland once a sufficient amount of GCs has been released.|$|R
50|$|Tropic hormones are {{hormones that}} have other {{endocrine}} glands as their target. Most tropic hormones are produced and <b>secreted</b> by the anterior pituitary. The hypothalamus <b>secretes</b> tropic hormones that target the anterior pituitary, and the thyroid gland <b>secretes</b> thyroxine, which targets the hypothalamus {{and therefore can}} be considered a tropic hormone.|$|R
