25|$|In 2013 a {{group of}} {{companies}} led by Telefônica Vivo announced plans to make Águas de São Pedro the first digital city in the country. In {{the first stage of}} the project, the telephone wiring of the city was replaced, changing from copper to optical fiber. An antenna, providing 4G technology, and security cameras were installed; tablets were distributed to students of the municipal school; the use of smart cars was introduced: presence sensors in a <b>smart</b> <b>car</b> parking system and a smart street lighting system were installed, reducing energy consumption. At the end of 2015, though continuing to provide services to the community, Telefônica Vivo transferred managing responsibility to the city government. The second stage begins in 2016, with the installation of interactive kiosks in public places, the training of teachers to work with new technologies, and the scheduling of medical appointments over the Internet.|$|E

50|$|The {{collision}} {{model can}} be thought of as a road wide enough for only one car. A <b>smart</b> <b>car</b> is traveling from one direction, and a plough from the other direction, eventually colliding. After the collision, the plough pushes the <b>smart</b> <b>car</b> backwards, as it continues to travel forward. In the collision model for Ube3a/Ube3a-ATS, RNA polymerases (RNAPs) travel towards each other along the sense and antisense templates during transcription. The sense and antisense templates overlap for Ube3a and Ube3a-ATS. The two transcription bubbles will collide head-on, and the RNAP transcribing the Ube3a-ATS, being the plough, will push the RNAP transcribing the Ube3a (<b>smart</b> <b>car),</b> backwards and eventually off of the template. This prevents complete transcription of Ube3a.|$|E
