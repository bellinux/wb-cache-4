50|$|Originally {{announced}} {{under the}} title Spider-Man Giant Size, the 1993 series was a quarterly series with double-length stories, {{which at the time}} was notable for being printed on glossy <b>stock</b> <b>paper</b> (a practice discontinued in later issues before being adopted by the entire Marvel line in the 2000s). Earlier issues played a part in Spider-Man crossovers; the first issue was the first part of Maximum Carnage and the second issue was the last part of Maximum Carnage. Issues #7-14 formed part of the Clone Saga. Later in the series, the focus shifted to stand-alone stories. Ron Lim penciled the lead story in the first 8 issues of the book. Most of the later issues were written by Christopher Golden and drawn by Joe Bennett.|$|E

He wrote a regular one-page [...] "Editors Notes" [...] column for the magazine and published articles and introductions to books. In later years he had a weekly half-hour [...] "Performance Today" [...] program with National Public Radio.

50|$|For {{calibrating}} {{the monitor}} a colorimeter is attached flat to the display's surface, shielded from all ambient light. The calibration software sends {{a series of}} color signals to the display and compares the values that were actually sent against the readings from the calibration device. This establishes the current offsets in color display. Depending on the calibration software and type of monitor used, the software either creates a correction matrix (i.e. an ICC profile) for color values before {{being sent to the}} display, or gives instructions for altering the display's brightness/contrast and RGB values through the OSD.This tunes the display to reproduce fairly accurately the in-gamut part of a desired color space. The calibration target for this kind of calibration is that of print <b>stock</b> <b>paper</b> illuminated by D65 light at 120 cd/m2.|$|E

50|$|I Love My India is {{a visual}} journey through Indian cities from a rare non-western point of view. (It) celebrates billboards, street-life, kitsch and popular culture. Unusually printed on {{uncoated}} <b>stock</b> <b>paper,</b> it {{is a bright}} pastiche of images born of everyday urban aesthetics. The material comes from various city streets with their mundane architecture, construction sites, traffic and images from popular culture —from cinematic posters to sentimental literary images, to those relating to archaic myths and to utilitarian signboards. The book moves through the spaces and signs of the city — both imaginative and physical — commenting on the complex and often surreal forms of human arrangements. Using digital as well as manual cut-and-paste techniques, he 'collected pictures from all over and reconstructed an imaginary, generic city'. Divided into three sections - Billboard City, Weak Architecture and Remote City, the book juxtaposes images without any evident hierarchy. In 2007, the artist made a video using select spreads from the book for an exhibition, Urban Manners at Hangar Bicocca in Milan.|$|E
