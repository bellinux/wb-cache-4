5|$|All seven PCI Express x16 <b>slots</b> <b>in</b> the Asus P6T7 {{motherboard}} {{were used}} in the building of the Fastra II computer. However, the video cards in the Fastra II are wide enough to require two such slots each. To solve this issue, the researchers came up with flexible PCI Express cables, and Tones developed a custom cage which allowed the video cards to suspend over the motherboard.|$|E
5|$|The album Hit and Run was {{released}} in April 1981, soon followed by the eponymous single. Both releases were very successful in the UK, with the album reaching position No.5 and the single position No.33 in the respective charts. The album charted also in New Zealand and in Canada, where it went gold. Hit and Run was not released in the USA until 1982, with a different track listing including songs from Demolition. The success of their second album made Girlschool a rising attraction in the boiling British hard rock and heavy metal scene, ensuring headliner <b>slots</b> <b>in</b> medium-sized arenas in their sold-out UK tour or guest <b>slots</b> <b>in</b> stadium size concerts of major attractions like Black Sabbath and Rush. No dates in the USA were arranged, but Girlschool visited Canada in July. Their 1981 tour culminated on 28 August, headlining the Friday night of the three-day Reading Festival. The Friday Rock Show on BBC Radio 1 would later broadcast the Reading set, but the recording has not received an official release.|$|E

5|$|Early in 1990, Slayer {{proposed}} a major tour featuring American thrash metal bands. Megadeth accepted, joining Slayer, Testament, and Suicidal Tendencies {{for the successful}} European Clash of the Titans tour. An American leg began the following year featuring Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax, with Alice in Chains as a supporting act. The tour was considered a multi-headliner, as the three main bands alternated time <b>slots.</b> <b>In</b> addition to the Clash of the Titans tour, Megadeth played with Judas Priest in North America late in 1990 and appeared at the second Rock in Rio festival in January 1991.|$|E
5|$|From 1998 onwards, the Copa Libertadores was {{sponsored}} by Toyota and {{became known as the}} Copa Toyota Libertadores. That same year, Mexican clubs, although affiliated to CONCACAF, started taking part in the competition thanks to quotas obtained from the Pre-Libertadores which pitted Mexican and Venezuelan clubs against each other for two <b>slots</b> <b>in</b> the group stage. The tournament was expanded to 34 teams and economic incentives were introduced by an agreement between CONMEBOL and Toyota Motor Corporation. All teams that advanced to the second stage of the tournament received $25,000 for their participation.|$|E
5|$|The group stage {{began on}} 18 November and ended on 27 November with Group A's final match between Ethiopia and Burundi. At {{the end of}} the group stage, the teams who {{finished}} bottom of their group were eliminated, along with the two teams above them (in Group A), and the team above them (in Group B), whereas the teams positioned in the top two <b>slots</b> <b>in</b> the groups progressed to the knock-out rounds. Due to there being an odd number of teams, Group A contained more matches and an additional team, with a total of 5 to Group B's 4 teams.|$|E

5|$|This ceiling conceals the mediaeval trusses of {{the fifteenth}} century ceiling. The wagon roof over the chancel was boarded or plastered, as <b>slots</b> <b>in</b> the {{principals}} show, in 1491 by William Stratford, DTh, Abbot of Vale Royal Abbey (in post 1476–1516, with gaps); the exact dating was derived from the timbers, which retain complete sapwood. The original ceiling can still be reached from the ringing chamber in the central tower, and includes an arch-braced collar-beam truss, with traces of five cross-ribs equally spaced on the soffit of the four-centred moulded arch. The truss had slots for the panels of a boarded ceiling (a wagon roof).|$|E
5|$|As of June 2017, Emirates has 48 orders {{outstanding}} {{but due to}} lack {{of space}} in Dubai Airport, it deferred 12 deliveries by one year and will not take any in 2019-20 before replacing its early airliners from 2021: there are open production <b>slots</b> <b>in</b> 2019 and Airbus reduced its production rate at 12 per year for 2017-18. The real backlog is much smaller than the official 107 with 47 uncertain orders: 20 commitments for the A380-specialized lessor Amedeo which commits to production only once aircraft are placed, eight for Qantas which wants to keep its fleet at 12, six for Virgin Atlantic which does not want them anymore and three ex Transaero for finance vehicle Air Accord.|$|E
5|$|On 31 July 2013, the Nationalist {{political}} party Maharashtra Navnirman Sena's film wing threatened {{to disrupt the}} film's premiere; it reportedly attempted to dislodge ongoing popular Marathi movies from cinemas that show only one film at a time. The party was upset with reports that the distributors of Chennai Express had demanded prime <b>slots</b> <b>in</b> single screen cinemas, and at some multiplexes, where the superhit Marathi film Duniyadari had been popular since 19 July. On 1 August 2013, both the film directors, Rohit Shetty and Sanjay Jadhav were called on by Raj Thackeray to find a solution. After listening to both parties, Thackeray ruled that if Duniyadari was not removed from single screen cinemas across the state, then the MNS would not object {{to the release of}} Chennai Express in Maharashtra.|$|E

5|$|Some {{scheduling}} {{problems can}} be modeled as a question about finding graph homomorphisms. As an example, one might want to assign workshop courses to time <b>slots</b> <b>in</b> a calendar so that two courses attended by the same student are not too {{close to each other}} in time. The courses form a graph G, with an edge between any two courses that are attended by some common student. The time slots form a graph H, with an edge between any two slots that are distant enough in time. For instance, if one wants a cyclical, weekly schedule, such that each student gets their workshop courses on non-consecutive days, then H would be the complement graph of C7. A graph homomorphism from G to H is then a schedule assigning courses to time slots, as specified. To add a requirement saying that, e.g., no single student has courses on both Friday and Monday, it suffices to remove the corresponding edge from H.|$|E
5|$|Street {{entertainment}} at Covent Garden {{was noted}} in Samuel Pepys's diary in May 1662, when he recorded the first {{mention of a}} Punch and Judy show in Britain. Impromptu performances of song and swimming were given by local celebrity William Cussans in the eighteenth century. Covent Garden is licensed for street entertainment, and performers audition for timetabled <b>slots</b> <b>in</b> a number of venues around the market, including the North Hall, West Piazza, and South Hall Courtyard. The courtyard space is dedicated to classical music only. There are street performances at Covent Garden Market {{every day of the}} year, except Christmas Day. Shows run throughout the day and are about 30 minutes in length. In March 2008, the market owner, CapCo, proposed to reduce street performances to one 30-minute show each hour.|$|E
5|$|The Fastra II's predecessor, the Fastra I, has 4 dual-GPU GeForce 9800 GX2 video cards, for a {{total of}} 8 GPUs. At that time, the ASTRA group needed a {{motherboard}} that had four PCI Express x16 slots with double-spacing between each of them. The only such motherboard the ASTRA group could find at that time was the MSI K9A2 Platinum, which has four such <b>slots.</b> <b>In</b> 2009, the Asus P6T7 WS Supercomputer motherboard, which the Fastra II uses, was released, which has seven PCI Express x16 slots. The Fastra II has six faster dual-GPU GeForce GTX 295 video cards, and a single-GPU GeForce GTX 275, {{for a total}} of 13 GPUs. In the Fastra II, the GPUs mainly perform tomographic reconstruction. The technique which allows GPUs to perform general-purpose tasks like this outside of gaming, instead of CPUs, is called GPGPU, general-purpose computing on graphics processing units.|$|E

5|$|The major {{international}} competition in {{football is the}} World Cup, organised by FIFA. This competition takes place every four years since 1930 {{with the exception of}} 1942 and 1946 tournaments, which were cancelled due to World War II. Approximately 190–200 national teams compete in qualifying tournaments within the scope of continental confederations for a place in the finals. The finals tournament, which is held every four years, involves 32 national teams competing over a four-week period. The World Cup is the most prestigious association football tournament in the world as well as the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world, exceeding even the Olympic Games; the cumulative audience of all matches of the 2006 FIFA World Cup was estimated to be 26.29 billion with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the final match, a ninth of the entire population of the planet. The current champion is Germany, which won its fourth title at the 2014 tournament in Brazil. FIFA Women's World Cup has been held every four years since 1991. Under the tournament's current format, national teams vie for 23 <b>slots</b> <b>in</b> a three-year qualification phase. (The host nation's team is automatically entered as the 24th slot.) The current champion is the United States, after winning their third title in the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup.|$|E
