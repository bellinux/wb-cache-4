40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate the use of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens as a probiotic source in the diet of rock bream, Oplegnathus fasciatus. A total of 210 fingerlings (25. 4 ± 0. 13 g) were divided into two groups, three replicates each; control (C) and probiotic (P) group (35 × 3 = 105 fish per group). C group was fed a basal diet without probiotic while P group was fed with B. amyloliquefaciens spores at a concentration of 1. 4 × 106 colony-forming units per gram (CFU/g) of feed. After 90 days, P group fish showed significant improvements in body weight (BW), weight gain (WG), specific growth rate (SGR) and food conversion ratio (FCR) when compared with C group fish. Also, in bi-weekly assessments, serum protein and glucose level showed a significant increase (p< 0. 05) in probiotic fed fish compared with the control group. Similar increase in serum antioxidant and lysozyme activity was found in the probiotic fed fish group.

40|$|<b>Streptococcus</b> <b>iniae</b> causes {{systemic}} infection characterized by meningitis and sepsis. Here, we report a larval zebrafishmodel of S. iniae infection. Injection of wild-type S. iniae into the otic vesicle induced a lethal infection by 24 h postinfection. In contrast, an S. iniaemutant deficient in polysaccharide capsule (cpsAmutant) was not lethal, with greater than 90 % survival at 24 h postinfection. Live imaging demonstrated that both neutrophils andmacrophages were recruited to localized otic infection with mutant and wild-type S. iniae {{and were able}} to phagocytose bacteria. Depletion of neutrophils and macrophages impaired host survival following infection with wild-type S. iniae and the cpsAmutant, suggesting that leukocytes are critical for host survival in the presence of both the wild-type andmutant bacteria. However, zebrafish larvae with impaired neutrophil function but nor-mal macrophage function had increased susceptibility to wild-type bacteria but not the cpsAmutant. Taking these findings to-gether, we have developed a larval zebrafish model of S. iniae infection and have found that although neutrophils are important for controlling infection with wild-type S. iniae, neutrophils are not necessary for host defense against the cpsAmutant. <b>Streptococcus</b> <b>iniae</b> is a major aquatic pathogen and a potentialzoonotic pathogen capable of causing systemic disease charac-terized bymeningitis and sepsis in both fish and humans.
