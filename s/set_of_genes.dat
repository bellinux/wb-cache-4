5|$|According to Mendelian inheritance, {{variations}} in an organism's phenotype (observable physical and behavioral characteristics) are {{due in part}} to {{variations in}} its genotype (particular <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>genes).</b> Each gene specifies a particular trait with different sequence of a gene (alleles) giving rise to different phenotypes. Most eukaryotic organisms (such as the pea plants Mendel worked on) have two alleles for each trait, one inherited from each parent.|$|E
5|$|Essential {{genes are}} the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>genes</b> {{thought to be}} {{critical}} for an organism's survival. This definition assumes the abundant availability of all relevant nutrients {{and the absence of}} environmental stress. Only a small portion of an organism's genes are essential. In bacteria, an estimated 250–400 genes are essential for Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, which is less than 10% of their genes. Half of these genes are orthologs in both organisms and are largely involved in protein synthesis. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the number of essential genes is slightly higher, at 1000 genes (~20% of their genes). Although the number is more difficult to measure in higher eukaryotes, mice and humans are estimated to have around 2000 essential genes (~10% of their genes). The synthetic organism, Syn 3, has a minimal genome of 473 essential genes and quasi-essential genes (necessary for fast growth), although 149 have unknown function.|$|E
5|$|At {{a certain}} point during the cell cycle in open mitosis, the cell divides to form two cells. In order for this process to be possible, each of the new {{daughter}} cells must have a full <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>genes,</b> a process requiring replication of the chromosomes as well as segregation of the separate sets. This occurs by the replicated chromosomes, the sister chromatids, attaching to microtubules, which in turn are attached to different centrosomes. The sister chromatids can then be pulled to separate locations in the cell. In many cells, the centrosome {{is located in the}} cytoplasm, outside the nucleus; the microtubules would be unable to attach to the chromatids {{in the presence of the}} nuclear envelope. Therefore, the early stages in the cell cycle, beginning in prophase and until around prometaphase, the nuclear membrane is dismantled. Likewise, during the same period, the nuclear lamina is also disassembled, a process regulated by phosphorylation of the lamins by protein kinases such as the CDC2 protein kinase. Towards the end of the cell cycle, the nuclear membrane is reformed, and around the same time, the nuclear lamina are reassembled by dephosphorylating the lamins.|$|E

25|$|Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) {{and similar}} methods take {{advantage}} of this kind of logic but uses more sophisticated statistics, because component genes in real processes display more complex behavior than simply moving up or down as a group, and the amount the genes move up and down is meaningful, not just the direction.

The physical mapping <b>of</b> the second <b>set</b> <b>of</b> rRNA <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> M. smegmatis (rRNA B) was done by restriction analysis of total chromosomal DNA. The two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> rRNA <b>genes</b> showed highly con-served restriction sites within the respective sets {{but not in the}} flanking regions.

25|$|In {{addition}} to these biological tools, certain naturally observed configurations of DNA (genes, promoters, enhancers, repressors) and the associated machinery itself {{are referred to as}} an expression system.

25|$|In animals, {{this is a}} rate-controlling step of gluconeogenesis, {{the process}} by which cells {{synthesize}} glucose from metabolic precursors. The blood glucose level is maintained within well-defined limits in part due to precise regulation of PEPCK gene expression. To emphasize the importance of PEPCK in glucose homeostasis, over expression of this enzyme in mice results in symptoms of type II diabetes mellitus, by far {{the most common form of}} diabetes in humans. Due to the importance of blood glucose homeostasis, a number of hormones regulate a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>genes</b> (including PEPCK) in the liver that modulate the rate of glucose synthesis.|$|E
25|$|Cells receive {{information}} from their neighbors through {{a class of}} proteins known as receptors. Notch is a cell surface protein that functions as a receptor.

Molecules that activate (or, in some cases, inhibit) receptors can be classified as hormones, neurotransmitters, cytokines, and growth factors, in general called receptor ligands.

25|$|Gene activations and {{metabolism}} alterations {{are examples}} of cellular responses to extracellular stimulation that require signal transduction. Gene activation leads to further cellular effects, since the products of responding genes include instigators of activation; transcription factors produced {{as a result of}} a signal transduction cascade can activate even more genes. Hence, an initial stimulus can trigger the expression of a large number of genes, leading to physiological events like the increased uptake of glucose from the blood stream and the migration of neutrophils to sites of infection. The <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>genes</b> and their activation order to certain stimuli is referred to as a genetic program.|$|E
25|$|Genes are {{pieces of}} DNA that contain {{information}} for synthesis of ribonucleic acids (RNAs) or polypeptides. Genes are inherited as units, with two parents dividing out copies of their genes to their offspring. This {{process can be}} compared with mixing two hands of cards, shuffling them, and then dealing them out again. Humans have two copies of each of their genes, and make copies that are found in eggs or sperm—but they only include one copy of each type of gene. An egg and sperm join to form a complete <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>genes.</b> The eventually resulting offspring has {{the same number of}} genes as their parents, but for any gene one of their two copies comes from their father, and one from their mother.|$|E
25|$|Gene {{nomenclature}} is {{the scientific}} naming of genes, the units of heredity in living organisms. An international committee published recommendations for genetic symbols and nomenclature in 1957. The {{need to develop}} formal guidelines for human gene names and symbols was recognized in the 1960s and full guidelines were issued in 1979 (Edinburgh Human Genome Meeting). Several other genus-specific research communities (e.g., Drosophila fruit flies, Mus mice) have adopted nomenclature standards, as well, and have published them on the relevant model organism websites and in scientific journals, including the Trends in Genetics Genetic Nomenclature Guide. Scientists familiar with a particular gene family may work together to revise the nomenclature for the entire <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>genes</b> when new information becomes available. For many genes and their corresponding proteins, an assortment of alternate names is in use across the scientific literature and public biological databases, posing a challenge to effective organization and exchange of biological information. Standardization of nomenclature thus tries to achieve the benefits of vocabulary control and bibliographic control, although adherence is voluntary. The advent {{of the information age}} has brought gene ontology, which in some ways is a next step of gene nomenclature, because it aims to unify the representation of gene and gene product attributes across all species.|$|E
