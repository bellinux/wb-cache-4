50|$|Electronic {{stringing}} machines {{control the}} tension with a computer-directed electric motor, resulting in fast paced stringing and exceptional accuracy. This {{is the most}} common kind of <b>stringing</b> <b>machine</b> found in racquet sport shops. Reliable constant pull stringing machines usually cost $3,000.00 and upwards. This type of <b>stringing</b> <b>machine</b> is found at nearly all professional tournaments.|$|E

5000|$|Currently {{based in}} Bordentown, New Jersey, Ektelon {{was founded by}} Franklin W. [...] "Bud" [...] Held in 1964 as the first company to {{manufacture}} racquetball racquets and stringing machines, {{not long after the}} development of the sport of racquetball by Joe Sobek. [...] Working from Held’s garage in San Diego, California, the company initially set out to build aluminum tennis racquets and a racquet <b>stringing</b> <b>machine.</b> [...] With the development of metal tennis racquets, the old techniques of stringing wooden racquets no longer worked, and Held saw the need for a new machine. Held is credited for one of the first patented designs for a racquet <b>stringing</b> <b>machine.</b> [...] He named the company Ektelon based on a combination of two Greek words: [...] "ektein", meaning to stretch out, and [...] "telon", representing the concept of perfection.|$|E

5000|$|After he {{had bought}} and adapted a <b>stringing</b> <b>machine</b> in 1972, {{he was asked to}} {{redesign}} the <b>stringing</b> <b>machine</b> at Ektelon Corp.. He started working for the Aetna World Cup tournament in Hartford, and by 1976 became the Floor General there, responsible for the stringing, the grounds and the ball courts. In 1975, he was so well known as a stringer and qualified pro trainer that he retired from the investment banking and became a full-time stringer, touring the circuit with his Bosworth Racket Clinic. Most famous collaboration is the one with Lendl. Roscoe Tanner claims his streak at the US Open in 79 (including wins against Lendl and Borg) was caused by Bosworth adjusting his rackets. Working with many of the top professional players, he was nicknamed [...] "The Wizard of Boz" [...] and [...] "The Doctor".|$|E
5000|$|In 2004 20-year-old Brown became {{unhappy with}} tennis in the country, but seeing his potential, the family {{decided to move}} back to Germany. In that same year Brown's parents gave him a Volkswagen campervan that could sleep up to three people. Since he did not need to stay at hotels, he was able to use the money saved to travel around Europe playing in tournaments. He said, [...] "It was a {{brilliant}} idea by my parents, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to go on playing. It was a means of competing week in, week out." [...] Brown, who also owned a racquet <b>stringing</b> <b>machine,</b> would earn money by restringing racquets for other players at a low cost as well as allowing players to use his spare beds for a night.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this program is to {{demonstrate}} the technical readiness of a cost effective process sequence {{that has the potential}} for the production of flat plate photovoltaic modules which met the price goal in 1986 of $. 70 or less per watt peak. Program efforts included: preliminary design review, preliminary cell fabrication using the proposed process sequence, verification of sandblasting back cleanup, study of resist parameters, evaluation of pull strength of the proposed metallization, measurement of contact resistance of Electroless Ni contacts, optimization of process parameter, design of the MEPSDU module, identification and testing of insulator tapes, development of a lamination process sequence, identification, discussions, demonstrations and visits with candidate equipment vendors, evaluation of proposals for tabbing and <b>stringing</b> <b>machine...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{solar module}} {{assembly}} machine which Kulicke and Soffa delivered under this contract is a cell tabbing and <b>stringing</b> <b>machine,</b> {{and capable of}} handling a variety of cells and assembling strings up to 4 feet long which then can be placed into a module array up to 2 feet by 4 feet {{in a series of}} parallel arrangement, and in a straight or interdigitated array format. The machine cycle is 5 seconds per solar cell. This machine is primarily adapted to 3 inch diameter round cells with two tabs between cells. Pulsed heat is used as the bond technique for solar cell interconnects. The solar module assembly machine unloads solar cells from a cassette, automatically orients them, applies flux and solders interconnect ribbons onto the cells. It then inverts the tabbed cells, connects them into cell strings, and delivers them into a module array format using a track mounted vacuum lance, from which they are taken to test and cleaning benches prior to final encapsulation into finished solar modules. Throughout the machine the solar cell is handled very carefully, and any contact with the collector side of the cell is avoided or minimized...|$|E
