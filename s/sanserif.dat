5000|$|In many comics, {{although}} the lettering is entirely in capital letters, serif versions of [...] "I" [...] are used exclusively where a capital I {{would appear in}} normal print text, and a <b>sanserif</b> (i.e., a simple vertical line) is used in all other places.

50|$|Slab-serif and <b>sanserif</b> types {{were rarely}} used for {{continuous}} bodies of text; their realm {{was that of}} advertisements, title-pages and other attention-catching pieces of print. By about 1820, most western countries were using modern romans and italics for continuous texts. This remained true until the 1860s, when so-called 'old style' faces - a largely English-speaking phenomenon - came into use. These went to the opposite extreme from the modern faces; 'thick' strokes were attenuated, and serifs {{at the end of}} thin strokes (as in C, E, L and T) were narrow and angled whereas in modern faces they were broad and vertical or nearly so. All the upper-case characters were somewhat 'condensed' (narrowed). Old style faces remained popular until about 1910.|$|E
5000|$|Edward Fella {{was known}} to break every rule in {{typography}} and design. He had a style that was unique {{to him at the}} time it was slightly base on the theory of deconstruction, but he took that and pushed it even further. He distorted a style of <b>sanserif</b> with his own hand writing with various thicknesses, curves, and tails to each character so that each one is different from the one before. Fella is one of the most extreme example of a typographer who is able to achieve the same creative freedom as the painters and sculptors he promoted in catalogs and posters.When Fella started making hand-hewn typography, he mirrored earlier [...] "words in freedom" [...] produced by Dadaist, Surrealist, and Futurist. [...] Fella has created two typefaces Outwest and Fella parts these typefaces show his eccentric and creative style. These typefaces both had a huge impact for being quirky and different. Outwest type looks like cactus wearing cowboy hats and Fella parts looks like a mix of comic sans and dingbat fonts. He distributes these font through Emigre fonts and even thought these fonts are crazy and over the top they were still adapted to mainstream designs.|$|E

5000|$|Three {{weeks after}} her run at Newmarket Saoire {{was one of}} {{eighteen}} fillies to contest the Irish 1000 Guineas at the Curragh, with Mick Kinane taking the ride. Virgina Waters started favourite ahead of Maids Causeway and the British challenger Damson (Queen Mary Stakes, Phoenix Stakes) with Saoire the 10/1 fourth choice in the betting. The other runners included Jazz Princess, Mona Lisa, Titian Time (runner-up in the Prix Marcel Boussac) and Penkenna Princess (Fred Darling Stakes). The outsider <b>Sanserif</b> set the pace with Saoire settled just behind the leaders before moving into contention {{in the last quarter}} mile. Kinane sent Saoire to the front a furlong out an she held on in a [...] "blanket finish" [...] to win by a short head and half a length from Penkenna Princess and Luas Line with the first ten fiillies home finishing within three lengths of the winner. Crowley became the first woman to officially train a winner of an Irish Classic: Ginger Wellesley had trained the winner of the Irish 1000 Guineas in 1948 but did not receive credit as women were not allowed to hold training licenses at that time, and the license was instead held by her male assistant. After the race Kinane said [...] "We were right up there from the start and she never dropped out of the first three or four. knew the others were coming to me but she picked up really well" [...] while Crowley commented [...] "I was watching from a little way down the track from the winning post and I thought we were second.

40|$|Since the 15 th century, {{advances}} in printing techniques {{have led to}} a persistent use of roman serif types due to their serifs’ support of horizontal eye movement. With the rise of the Industrial Revolution, a bolder, more attention-grabbing typeface was needed. This led to the birth of many <b>sanserif</b> types during the 19 th century. A debate has transpired as to whether serif or <b>sanserif</b> types are more comfortable to read in continuous running text. Taking the serif – <b>sanserif</b> debate further, another question arises: Which <b>sanserif</b> types are more efficient and comfortable when reading continuous running text? ^ In visual communication design, the use of types and type choices are often discussed, but it is usually a designer’s visual taste that influences the type they choose. This research aims to clarify those problems by analyzing two <b>sanserif</b> types: Humanist and Grotesque. These two typefaces are chosen because of their structural similarities and differences among other <b>sanserif</b> categories. Geometric and Contrast <b>sanserif</b> types are excluded due to their individualistic qualities. This thesis will discuss the historic evolution of humanist and grotesque types through a comparison investigation. A survey study of librarians and editors is conducted to identify their preference between humanist and grotesque types in order to clarify the use of <b>sanserif</b> types. ...|$|E

Facts regarding how reading works {{and the importance of}} the words formation for the readability were used to form a computer test. This test was performed by 15 test persons and the results were analyzed. The results show that the serif was easier to read than the <b>sanserif.</b> The words of the serif which were easiest to read were the words with positive tracking and the words with capital letters.

I examine the contributions made by infant teachers to typography and book design and draw particular attention to the print script movement and the gradual introduction of <b>sanserif</b> typefaces in reading books. I suggest that the use of sanserifs in reading books for young children is one of their first appearances for continuous text. Although the influence of print script on the teaching of handwriting may have had some undesirable effects, I suggest that it indirectly contributed to some innovations in book design...|$|E
40|$|The {{first half}} of the twentieth century was {{undoubtedly}} one of the most fecund and complex periods in both the history of advertising and the promotion of men’s wear in Britain. This was a time when vast sums of money were being dedicated to the production and circulation of advertisements promoting men’s clothing; between January and September 1933, for instance, nearly fifty-six thousand pounds (the equivalent of just over three millions pounds in 2001) were spent by nine outfitters on press advertising space alone. This article concentrates on one of these companies – Austin Reed, which not only had a sizeable publicity budget (between January and September 1933, for instance, it spent £ 40, 820 on press advertising) but also pioneered inventive ways of advertising men’s wear in poster and press campaigns from its foundation in 1900 until the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. Pandering to a predominantly upper middle class clientele, press advertising for Austin Reed appeared in the likes of the Times, Daily Mail, Evening Standard, Radio Times and Punch during the 1920 s and 1930 s (all of which had a solid Class A, B and C readership at this time, or those with gross annual earnings of between £ 250 and £ 1, 000 and above). But in promoting ideas of class and status, Austin Reed also espoused modernist graphic aesthetics in both its poster and press campaigns that involved the simplification of shapes and forms, photographs, <b>sanserif</b> typefaces, and white space. In this regard the contribution of the commercial artist Tom Purvis and the copywriter W. D. H. McCullough was pivotal in elaborating visual and verbal rhetoric that transcended ‘reason why’ advertising, which emphasised the use value of any product, and tended instead to suggestive or atmospheric forms of promotion that transformed ‘simple use into an experience of the mind’. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of microphotographic methods for the processing and storage of information has grown steadily {{during the last}} two decades. The microphotographic system, through which the information must pass at a minimum is as follows: Step 1 : Photographing of the original document at a large reduction onto a silver halide microfilm. Step 2 : Duplicating through contact printing onto a non-silver photographic material. Step 3 : Second generation duplication onto a nonsilver photographic material (This image may be used on a microfilm reader). Step 4 : Enlargement of the second generation duplicate to give a hard copy print. One of the main objectives of this system is the production of a legible image {{at the end of the}} process. As the steps mentioned above indicate, the creation of the original negative at a large reduction is the first major step and critical to the success of future steps in the process. A mistake in camera exposure at this point may well cause an illegible image to be produced at the end of the system. A technique long utilized by the microfilm industry for the measurement of small scale image quality of greatly reduced images is resolution in lines per millimeter. The purpose of this experiment is to determine the relationship between resolution and legibility for similarly produced original negatives. The methodology of the experiment consisted of producing original negatives in a conventional microphotographic system at 24 x reduction of two types of resolution test targets. The NBS 10 - 10 (100 : 1 contrast) test chart and the R. I. T. alphanumeric (100 : 1 and 8 : 1 contrast) test objects v/ere the three targets used. The three targets were photographed at eight equally spaced exposure levels with a total ratio of 10 : 1. Replicate images were made at each exposure level. The resolution measurements were read from an 80 x microscope and from a microfilm reader at 24 x by this author. A series of standard documents in two different type faces (ten point serif and <b>sanserif)</b> were exposed and processed in the same manner as the resolution targets. Replicate sets were made at each exposure level. The standard documents consisted of meaningful, continuous, textual material. The original negatives of these standard documents were evaluated for their legibility by placing them in a microfilm reader (24 x) and determining the distance at which the images became legible. Fifteen observers were employed. The average distance measurements were used to determine the relative legibility of the original negatives. A two- factor ANOVA at an alpha risk of 0. 05 indicated that type face did not affect the relative legibility of the negatives. Camera exposure level was found to be significant, which means that images of varying legibility were produced. The functional relationships between resolution from the three targets versus camera exposure level and between relative legibility versus camera exposure level were determined and found to fit second-order models. The optimum camera exposure for both measures of image quality were less than one-third of a stop apart. The correlation between resolution and relative legibility was high in all cases (minimum of. 86) and significant at the 0. 01 level. A linear model best fits these functional relationships. The R. I. T. 8 : 1 contrast target provided the highest correlation with r equal to O. 96. The NBS and R. I. T. test charts were very similar in the resolution measurements obtained from each. However, when a secondary observer 2 ̆ 7 s measurements were compared to this author 2 ̆ 7 s the between observer differences in resolution values for the NBS target were nearly four times as large as the differences on the R. I. T. target. In summary, the camera exposure of the original negative that provides the highest resolution in a microfilm system will also be very close to the exposure that yields the optimum legibility for commonly employed type styles and sizes. The resolution measurements can be obtained directly from the microfilm reader that is a part of the system. If the R. I. T. 8 : 1 contrast target is used the legibility predictions will have a high level of accuracy and excel lent precision...|$|E
