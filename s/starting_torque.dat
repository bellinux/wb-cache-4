5|$|Fixed-speed loads {{subject the}} motor {{to a high}} <b>starting</b> <b>torque</b> and to current surges that are up to eight times the {{full-load}} current. AC drives instead gradually ramp the motor up to operating speed to lessen mechanical and electrical stress, reducing maintenance and repair costs, and extending {{the life of the}} motor and the driven equipment.|$|E
5|$|In {{starting}} a motor, a VFD initially applies a low frequency and voltage, thus avoiding high inrush current associated with direct-on-line starting. After {{the start of}} the VFD, the applied frequency and voltage are increased at a controlled rate or ramped up to accelerate the load. This starting method typically allows a motor to develop 150% of its rated torque while the VFD is drawing less than 50% of its rated current from the mains in the low-speed range. A VFD can be adjusted to produce a steady 150% <b>starting</b> <b>torque</b> from standstill right up to full speed. However, motor cooling deteriorates and can result in overheating as speed decreases such that prolonged low-speed operation with significant torque is not usually possible without separately motorized fan ventilation.|$|E

In order to confirm the efficiency of the proposed method the results are also compared with those achieved by using GA, PSO, and PAMP. The simulations show that in the problem under consideration ABC converges considerably faster than other algorithms and the results are as accurate as PAMP...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. During {{the drive}} speed {{operation}} with motor, {{due to the}} big difference between the synchronous speed and the motor speed, it likely causes too much current. When the current exceeds a certain limit, it will cause the drive to current protection of the acceleration. For the over-current drive in the tanker case, by analyzing the causes of over-current proceeding, the key points are described from the load check, the drive hardware check, the parameters check, input/output circuit inspection and so on. When the large <b>start</b> <b>torque</b> or acceleration torque is necessary, the motor torque of about 100 to 150 % can be generated in the low frequency area by adjusting the torque boost...|$|R
25|$|The WRIM is used {{primarily}} {{to start a}} high inertia load or a load that requires a very high <b>starting</b> <b>torque</b> across the full speed range. By correctly selecting the resistors used in the secondary resistance or slip ring starter, the motor is able to produce maximum torque at a relatively low supply current from zero speed to full speed. This type of motor also offers controllable speed.|$|E
25|$|An {{advantage}} of the universal motor is that AC supplies may be used on motors that have some characteristics more common in DC motors, specifically high <b>starting</b> <b>torque</b> and very compact design if high running speeds are used. The negative aspect is the maintenance and short life problems caused by the commutator. Such motors are used in devices, such as food mixers and power tools, that are used only intermittently, and often have high starting-torque demands. Multiple taps on the field coil provide (imprecise) stepped speed control. Household blenders that advertise many speeds frequently combine a field coil with several taps and a diode that can be inserted in series with the motor (causing the motor to run on half-wave rectified AC). Universal motors also lend themselves to electronic speed control and, as such, are an ideal choice for devices like domestic washing machines. The motor {{can be used to}} agitate the drum (both forwards and in reverse) by switching the field winding with respect to the armature.|$|E
2500|$|Smooth rotor disks were {{originally}} proposed, but these gave poor <b>starting</b> <b>torque.</b> [...] Tesla subsequently discovered that smooth rotor disks with small washers bridging the disks in ~12–24 {{places around the}} perimeter of a 10″ disk and a second ring of 6–12 washers at a sub-diameter made for a significant improvement in <b>starting</b> <b>torque,</b> without compromising efficiency.|$|E
40|$|The {{symptoms}} and eventual resolution of a torque increase problem occurring with ball bearings in the joints of the AX- 5 space suit are described. <b>Starting</b> <b>torques</b> that rose 5 to 10 times initial levels {{were observed in}} crew evaluation tests of the suit in a zero-g water tank. This bearing problem {{was identified as a}} blocking torque anomaly, observed previously in oscillatory gimbal bearings. A large matrix of lubricants, ball separator designs and materials were evaluated. None of these combinations showed sufficient tolerance to lubricant washout when repeatedly cycled in water. The problem was resolved by retrofitting a pressure compensated, water exclusion seal to the outboard side of the bearing cavity. The {{symptoms and}} possible remedies to blocking are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Aiming at the ultra {{high speed}} {{permanent}} magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) supported by gas foil bearings (GFBs), this paper calculates the transient line starting of the motor. Firstly, the start {{effect of the}} rotor composed of cylindrical PM and stainless steel sleeve is studied. Then, {{in order to enhance}} the <b>start</b> <b>torque,</b> copper ring, nickel ring and copper squirrel-cage are introduced in the rotor and their start effect are analysed, respectively. It can be found that the rotor including nickel ring can be accelerated to set speed, but all the other rotors are failed due to the higher PM and braking torques. It can be concluded that some material owning slight large relative permeability can be applied in the rotor to reduce the PM field and contribute to start by using the line-start method...|$|R

2500|$|In {{single phase}} {{squirrel}} cage motors, the primary winding within the motor housing is {{not capable of}} starting a rotational motion on the rotor, but is capable of sustaining one. To start the motor, a secondary [...] "start" [...] winding has a series non-polarized starting capacitor to introduce a lead in the sinusoidal current. When the secondary (start) winding is placed at an angle {{with respect to the}} primary (run) winding, a rotating electric field is created. The force of the rotational field is not constant, but is sufficient to start the rotor spinning. When the rotor comes close to operating speed, a centrifugal switch (or current-sensitive relay in series with the main winding) disconnects the capacitor. The start capacitor is typically mounted {{to the side of the}} motor housing. These are called capacitor-start motors, that have relatively high <b>starting</b> <b>torque.</b> Typically they can have up-to four times as much <b>starting</b> <b>torque</b> than a split-phase motor and are used on applications such as compressors, pressure washers and any small device requiring high starting torques.|$|E
2500|$|For {{locomotives}} where a high <b>starting</b> <b>torque</b> and {{low speed}} were required, the conventional direct drive approach was inadequate. [...] "Geared" [...] steam locomotives, {{such as the}} Shay, the Climax and the Heisler, were developed to meet this need on industrial, logging, mine and quarry railways. The common feature of these three types was the provision of reduction gearing and a drive shaft between the crankshaft and the driving axles. This arrangement allowed the engine to run {{at a much higher}} speed than the driving wheels compared to the conventional design, where the ratio is 1:1.|$|E
2500|$|Darrieus wind turbine: [...] "Eggbeater" [...] turbines, or Darrieus turbines, {{were named}} after the French inventor, Georges Darrieus. They have good efficiency, but produce large torque ripple and {{cyclical}} stress on the tower, which contributes to poor reliability. They also generally require some external power source, or an additional Savonius rotor to start turning, because the <b>starting</b> <b>torque</b> is very low. The torque ripple is reduced by using three or more blades which results in greater solidity of the rotor. Solidity is measured by blade area divided by the rotor area. Newer Darrieus type turbines are not held up by guy-wires but have an external superstructure connected to the top bearing.|$|E
40|$|An asynchronous, {{dielectric}} micro-motor {{consisting of}} an Al-SiO 2 rotor of 50 to 200 mu m diameter was driven with 4 or 8 circularly arranged electrodes in water. The motor elements were fabricated by micromachining. Each electrode {{was designed to}} be an oscillatory circuit with a sharp resonance frequency in the upper kHz-range. The resonances at all electrode tips increase the voltage in the stator-rotor gap by a factor of up to 15. As a result, the dielectric rotor operates in a sharp frequency window at 5 Vpp excitation as if driven with more than 75 Vpp. With square wave pulses, the higher order Fourier-components induce several changes in rotor spin direction within two frequency decades. The micro-motor has been driven for hours without noticeable wear. It developed high <b>starting</b> <b>torques</b> and was useful for circular water pumping. The system has the advantage of very sensitive frequency dependence and the low drive voltages (below 10 V) can be produced by most electronic circuits...|$|R

40|$|The roller {{swashplate}} {{bearing in}} hydraulic piston pumps is very unique in applications of roller element bearings. The main advantages {{of this type}} of bearings are low friction, very small difference between <b>start</b> <b>torque</b> and steady state torque, and no additional pressure source is required for their functioning. Therefore, better control performance and higher efficiency can be expected from piston pumps with roller swashplate bearings, compared with pumps with hydrostatic or plain ones. However, it is particularly challenging to design a roller swashplate bearing to meet the very demanding and widely varying load requirements for heavy duty off-highway machine operations, considering cost and pump size limitations. Quite different from most other roller bearing applications, a roller swashplate bearing for heavy duty hydraulic piston pumps is subject to (a) extremely high contact pressure between rollers and races due to high system pressure, (b) high frequency oscillating forces in three dimensions caused by the torque ripple and discharge pressure ripple inherent in pump rotating group, (c) very unfavorable local lubrication conditions when the pump is operated with no or little displacement change, and (d) sliding between rollers and races because of frequent sudden pump displacement changes. Based on the observed failure modes of bearings in this application, this paper discusses several measures to improve the fatigue life of the swashplate roller bearing for an axial swashplate type piston pump used in a heavy duty off-highway machine. Analyses, simulation results, and machine operation results are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed measures. 1...|$|R
