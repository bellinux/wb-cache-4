Numerous expeditions were mounted to search for this treasure, all which ended in failure. The illustration of El Dorado's location on maps only made matters worse, as it made <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the city of El Dorado's existence had been confirmed. The mythical city of El Dorado on Lake Parime was marked on numerous maps until its existence was disproved by Alexander von Humboldt during his Latin America expedition (1799–1804).|$|E

2500|$|Albino Luciani's {{views on}} Humanae vitae have been debated. Journalist John L. Allen, Jr. claims that [...] "it's {{virtually}} certain that John Paul I {{would not have}} reversed Paul VI’s teaching, particularly since he was no doctrinal radical. Moreover, as Patriarch in Venice some had seen a hardening of his stance on social issues {{as the years went}} by." [...] According to Allen [...] "...it is reasonable to assume that John Paul I would not have insisted upon the negative judgment in Humanae Vitae as aggressively and publicly as John Paul II did, and probably would not have treated it as a quasi-infallible teaching. It would have remained a more 'open' question". Other sources take a different view and note that during his time as Patriarch of Venice that [...] "Luciani was intransigent with his upholding of the teaching of the Church and severe with those, through intellectual pride and disobedience paid no attention to the Church's prohibition of contraception", though while not condoning the sin, he was tolerant of those who sincerely tried and {{failed to live up to}} the Church's teaching. The book states that [...] "...if <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> his compassion and gentleness in this respect implies he was against Humane Vitae one can only infer it was wishful thinking on their part and an attempt to find an ally in favor of artificial contraception." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{story of}} the {{penitent}} thief is a most beautiful and affecting one. Christians' hearts, in all times, have clung to it for comfort, not only for themselves, but for those whom they loved. Indeed, <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{we are likely to}} be too fond of the story. They have been afraid lest people should build too much on it; lest they should fancy that it gives them licence to sin, and lead bad lives, all their days, provided only they repent at last; lest it should countenance too much what is called a death-bed repentance.|$|E

60|$|It {{is proper}} here to repeat, once for {{all in this}} volume, a remark which has {{elsewhere}} often {{been made in the}} various works of this series, that in studying ancient history at the present day, it is less important now to know, in regard to transactions so remote, what the facts actually were which really occurred, than it is to know the story respecting them, which, for the last two thousand years, has been in circulation among mankind. It is now, for example, of very little consequence whether there ever was or never was such a personage as Hercules, but it is essential that every educated man should know the story which ancient writers tell in relating his doings. In this view of the case, our object, in this volume, is simply to give the history of Xerxes just as it stands, without stopping to separate the false from the true. In relating the occurrences, therefore, which have been described in this chapter, we simply give the alleged facts to our readers precisely as the ancient historians give them to us, leaving each reader to decide for himself how far he will believe the narrative. In respect to this particular story, we will add, that <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Mardonius was really the ghost by whose appearance Artabanus and Xerxes were so dreadfully frightened.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the existence of}} religion in globalization era. Religious values, which are private, sacral, and transcendent, interact with the globalization circle, {{which seems to be}} contradictory with religion. Globalization is utilitarian  as its nature and it results in vanish of local values or cultures. However, none can avoid, neither can religious people. Responds to globalization frequently occur in extreme behavior since <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> globalization will threat their existence in this world. Such responds make the people labeled as fundamentalists or terrorists, and many of them have religious background.  Some of religious groups extremely rejecting globalization can be found states of former USSR, Japan, and Iran. Finally, this paper presents the forms and  positions of  religion suggested by four figures, i. e. Immanuel Wallerstein, John Meyer, Roland Robertson, and Niklas Luhmann. They suggest that the religions will keep their existence if they adopt the values of globalization and make themselves the instrument of communication as well as political and economic interaction of the world’s interaction. Religion should evolve from narrow mindedness to a broader, new, and universal values...|$|R
