It {{should also be noted}} that not all spermatogonia divide to produce spermatocytes; otherwise, the supply of spermatogonia would run out. Instead, <b>spermatogonial</b> stem cells divide mitotically to produce copies of themselves, ensuring a constant supply of spermatogonia to fuel spermatogenesis.|$|E
25|$|Description: This {{paper is}} written in support of Moore and Robinson’s {{previous}} interpretation that, {{in regards to the}} spermatogenesis of Periplanata americana, the nucleolus of the first spermatocyte is the homologue of one or two <b>spermatogonial</b> chromosomes. They attribute the elongate form to mechanical influences and believe it to usually have a spherical shape like the nucleolus. In place of Periplanata americana, Foot and Strobell studied the spermatogenesis of Anasa tristis. The original paper asserts that Anasa tristis has 22 chromosomes, but they confirmed Paulmier and Montgomery’s assessment that Anasa tristis has 21 chromosomes after the paper was sent to press.|$|E

2500|$|Spermatogenesis [...] is {{the process}} in which an animal {{produces}} spermatozoa from <b>spermatogonial</b> stem cells by way of mitosis and meiosis. The initial cells in this pathway are called spermatogonia, which yield primary spermatocytes by mitosis. The primary spermatocyte divides meiotically (Meiosis I) into two secondary spermatocytes; each secondary spermatocyte [...] divides into two spermatids by Meiosis II. These develop into mature spermatozoa, also known as sperm cells. Thus, the primary spermatocyte gives rise to two cells, the secondary spermatocytes, and the two secondary spermatocytes by their subdivision produce four spermatozoa.|$|E
2500|$|Spermatogenesis {{takes place}} within several {{structures}} of the male reproductive system. The initial stages occur within the testes and progress to the epididymis where the developing gametes mature and are stored until ejaculation. The seminiferous tubules of the testes are {{the starting point for}} the process, where <b>spermatogonial</b> stem cells adjacent to the inner tubule wall divide in a centripetal directionbeginning at the walls and proceeding into the innermost part, or lumento produce immature sperm. Maturation occurs in the epididymis. The location [...] is specifically important as the process of spermatogenesis requires a lower temperature to produce viable sperm, specifically 1°-8°C lower than normal body temperature of 37°C (98.6°F). Clinically, small fluctuations in temperature such as from an athletic support strap, causes no impairment in sperm viability or count.|$|E
50|$|The selfish <b>spermatogonial</b> {{selection}} hypothesis {{proposes that}} {{the influence of}} <b>spermatogonial</b> mutations in older men is further enhanced because cells with certain mutations have a selective advantage over other cells. Such an advantage would allow the mutated cells to increase in number through clonal expansion. In particular, mutations that affect the RAS pathway, which regulates <b>spermatogonial</b> proliferation, appear to offer a competitive advantage to <b>spermatogonial</b> cells, while also leading to diseases associated with paternal age.|$|E

50|$|<b>Spermatogonial</b> {{stem cells}} (SSCs) are a subtype of {{undifferentiated}} spermatogonia.|$|E
50|$|The cell is also {{responsible}} for establishing and maintaining the <b>spermatogonial</b> stem cell niche, which ensures the renewal of stem cells and the differentiation of spermatogonia into mature germ cells that progress stepwise through the long process of spermatogenesis, ending in the release of spermatozoa in {{a process known as}} spermiation. Sertoli cells bind to <b>spermatogonial</b> cells via N-cadherins and galactosyltransferase (via carbohydrate residues).|$|E
5000|$|Type A (dark) cells, {{with dark}} nuclei. These cells are reserve <b>spermatogonial</b> stem cells {{which do not}} usually undergo active mitosis.|$|E

50|$|Type A (pale) cells, {{with pale}} nuclei. These are the <b>spermatogonial</b> stem cells that undergo active mitosis. These cells divide to produce Type B cells.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} {{spermatogenesis}} begins when the GSCs divide asymmetrically, producing a GSC that maintains hub contact, and a gonialblast that exits the niche. The SSCs divide with their GSC partner, and their non-mitotic progeny, the somatic cyst cells (SCCs, a.k.a. cyst cells) will enclose the gonialblast. The gonialblast then undergoes four rounds of synchronous, transit-amplifying divisions with incomplete cytokinesis {{to produce a}} sixteen-cell <b>spermatogonial</b> cyst. This <b>spermatogonial</b> cyst then differentiates and grows into a spermatocyte, which will eventually undergo meiosis and produce sperm.|$|E
50|$|Stem {{cells are}} being {{explored}} {{for use in}} conservation efforts. <b>Spermatogonial</b> stem cells have been harvested from a rat and placed into a mouse host and fully mature sperm were produced {{with the ability to}} produce viable offspring. Currently research is underway to find suitable hosts for the introduction of donor <b>spermatogonial</b> stem cells. If this becomes a viable option for conservationists, sperm can be produced from high genetic quality individuals who die before reaching sexual maturity, preserving a line that would otherwise be lost.|$|E
50|$|The {{connections}} between cells allow development to be synchronised. When repeated division ceases, the cells differentiate into type B spermatogonia. This stage {{is referred to}} as the <b>spermatogonial</b> phase.|$|E
50|$|Three {{functionally}} separate <b>spermatogonial</b> cell {{types are}} recognised {{on the basis}} of the appearance of the nuclei: type A dark spermatogonia (Ad), type A pale spermatogonia (Ap), and type B spermatogonia (B).|$|E
50|$|Although spermatocytes {{that divide}} mitotically and meiotically are {{sensitive}} to radiation and cancer, <b>spermatogonial</b> stem cells are not. Therefore, after termination of radiation therapy or chemotherapy, the spermatognia stems cells may re-initiate the formation of spermatogenesis.|$|E
50|$|The {{chemical}} is an alkylating agent, {{and acts}} by transferring the ethyl group of ENU to nucleobases (usually thymine) in nucleic acids. Its main targets are the <b>spermatogonial</b> stem cells, from which mature sperm are derived.|$|E
50|$|Advanced {{paternal}} age may {{be associated}} with a higher risk for certain single-gene disorders caused by mutations of the FGFR2, FGFR3, and RET genes. These conditions are Apert syndrome, Crouzon syndrome, Pfeiffer syndrome, achondroplasia, thanatophoric dysplasia, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2b. The most significant effect concerns achondroplasia (a form of dwarfism), which might occur in about 1 in 1,875 children fathered by men over 50, compared to 1 in 15,000 in the general population. However, the risk for achondroplasia is still considered clinically negligible. The FGFR genes may be particularly prone to a paternal age effect due to selfish <b>spermatogonial</b> selection, whereby the influence of <b>spermatogonial</b> mutations in older men is enhanced because cells with certain mutations have a selective advantage over other cells (see § DNA mutations).|$|E
5000|$|Spermatia {{transferred}} in {{this way}} fuse with receptive <b>spermatogonial</b> hyphae on the recipient plant. The resulting hyphae subsequently form aecia. At this time, the pseudoflowers lose their green colour and stop producing nectar. Spores produced in the aecia, referred to as aeciospores, are responsible for infecting P. monoicas alternate host plant (a grass species of Koeleria, Trisetum, or Stipa).|$|E
50|$|At puberty, {{spermatogonia}} {{located along}} {{the walls of the}} seminiferous tubules within the testis will be initiated and start to divide mitotically, forming two types of A cells that contain an oval shaped nucleus with a nucleolus attached to the nuclear envelope; one is dark (Ad) and the other is pale (Ap), which can be seen in Figure 3. The Ad cells are spermatogonia that will stay in the basal compartment (outer region of the tubule); these cells are reserve <b>spermatogonial</b> stem cells that do not usually undergo mitosis. Type Ap are actively-dividing <b>spermatogonial</b> stem cells which begin differentiation to type B spermatogonia, which have round nuclei and heterochromatin attached to the nuclear envelope and the center of nucleolus. Type B cells will move on to the adluminal compartment (towards the inner region of tubule) and become primary spermatocytes; this process takes about 16 days to complete.|$|E

50|$|The murine GSC {{niche in}} males, also called <b>spermatogonial</b> stem cell (SSC) niche, {{is located in}} the basal region of seminiferous tubules in the testes. The seminiferous {{epithelium}} is composed of sertoli cells that are in contact with the basement membrane of the tubules, which separates the sertoli cells from the interstitial tissue below. This interstitial tissue comprises Leydig cells, macrophages, mesenchymal cells, capillary networks, and nerves.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spermatogonial</b> {{stem cells}} are the {{precursors}} to spermatozoa, which are produced {{through a series of}} differentiation steps. This is the alternative SSC outcome to self-renewal. SSCs survive within microenvironments, termed niches, which provide extrinsic stimuli that drive stem cell differentiation or self-renewal. The SSC niche is found in the seminiferous epithelium of mammalian testis, and is primarily constituted of Sertoli and peritubular myoid cells.|$|E
5000|$|Spermatogenesis is {{the process}} in which {{spermatozoa}} are produced from <b>spermatogonial</b> stem cells by way of mitosis and meiosis. A major function of meiosis is homologous recombinational repair of this germline DNA. [...] RNF8 plays {{an essential role in}} signaling the presence of DNA double-strand breaks. Male mice with a gene knockout for RNF8 have impaired spermatogenesis, apparently due to a defect in homologous recombinational repair.|$|E

50|$|Self-renewal of <b>spermatogonial</b> {{stem cells}} (SSCs) is {{regulated}} by local signals. Around 50% of the SSC population undergo self-renewal to maintain stem cell numbers, {{and the other}} 50% become committed progenitor cells that will differentiate into spermatozoa during spermatogenesis. Cells present in the testes express molecules that play key roles in the regulation of SSC self-renewal. In mice, Sertoli cells {{have been shown to}} secrete Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) which has a stimulatory effect on stem cell self-renewal. This factor is thought to be expressed in the peritubular cells in human testes. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) is another molecule crucial for the regulation of stem cell renewal and is expressed in Sertoli cells, Leydig cells and germ cells. FGF2 signalling interacts with GDNF to enhance proliferation rate. Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12) signaling via its receptor C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) is also involved in regulation of SSC fate decisions.CXCL12 is found in Sertoli cells in the basement membrane of the seminiferous tubules in adult mouse testes, and its receptor is expressed in undifferentiated <b>spermatogonial</b> cells.|$|E
5000|$|Primary oocytes {{will undergo}} {{oogenesis}} {{in which they}} enter meiosis. However, primary oocytes are arrested in prophase 1 of the first meiosis and remain in that arrested stage until puberty begins in the female adult. [...] This {{is in contrast to}} male primordial germ cells which are arrested in the <b>spermatogonial</b> stage at birth and do not enter into spermatogenesis and meiosis to produce primary spermatocytes until puberty in the adult male.|$|E
5000|$|Anticancer {{drugs such}} as {{doxorubicin}} and vincristine can adversely affect male fertility by damaging the DNA of proliferative <b>spermatogonial</b> stem cells. Experimental exposure of rat undifferentiated spermatogonia to doxorubicin and vincristine indicated that these cells are {{able to respond to}} DNA damage by increasing their expression of DNA repair genes, and that this response likely partially prevents DNA break accumulation. [...] In addition to a DNA repair response, exposure of spermatogonia to doxorubicin can also induce programmed cell death (apoptosis).|$|E
5000|$|Male {{reproductive}} function declines {{with increasing}} age {{as indicated by}} decreased sperm quality and fertility. [...] As rats age, undifferentiated <b>spermatogonial</b> cells undergo numerous changes in gene expression. [...] These changes include upregulation of several genes involved in the DNA damage response. This finding suggests that during aging there {{is an increase in}} DNA damage leading to an upregulation of DNA damage response proteins to help repair these damages. [...] Thus it appears that reproductive aging originates in undifferentiated spermatogenic cells.|$|E
50|$|PAX7 {{functions}} as a marker for a rare subset of <b>spermatogonial</b> stem cells, specifically a sub set of Asingle spermatogonia. These PAX7+ spermatogonia are rare in adult testis but are much more prevalent in newborns, making up 28% of germ cells in neonate testis. Unlike PAX7+ muscle satellite cells, PAX7+ spermatogonia rapidly proliferate and are not quiescent. PAX7+ spermatogonia are able to give rise to all stages of spermatogenesis and produce motile sperm. However, PAX7 is not required for spermatogenesis, as mice without PAX7+ spermatogonia show no deficits in fertility.|$|E

50|$|In 2011, Ogawa and {{his colleagues}} succeeded to produce {{functional}} sperm from <b>spermatogonial</b> stem cells with the testis of mouse using an organ culture method, {{which was the first}} demonstration of mammalian. The result could change views about fertility and spermatogenesis and result in new diagnostics for male infertility as well as treatment and follow-up of patients with cancer. In 2014, his research group reported that a sample of frozen testicle has been used to produce live offspring in experiments on mice, and this breakthrough could have important implications for boys with cancer who become infertile due to chemotherapy treatments.|$|E
50|$|Many {{studies have}} focused on the {{proximate}} causes of sequential hermaphroditism. The role of aromatase has been widely studied in this area. Aromatase is an enzyme that controls the androgen/estrogen ratio in animals by catalyzing the conversion of testosterone into oestradiol, which is irreversible. It has been discovered that the aromatase pathway mediates sex change in both directions. Many studies also involve understanding the effect of aromatase inhibitors on sex change. One such study was performed by Kobayashi et al. In their study they tested the role of estrogens in male three-spot wrasses (Halichoeres trimaculatus). They discovered that fish treated with aromatase inhibitors showed decreased gonodal weight, plasma estrogen level and <b>spermatogonial</b> proliferation in the testis as well as increased androgen levels. Their results suggest that estrogens are important in the regulation of spermatogenesis in this protogynous hermaphrodite.|$|E
