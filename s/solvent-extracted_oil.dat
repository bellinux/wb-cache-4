30|$|Castor oil is {{extracted}} colourless to very pale yellow viscous liquid {{with a distinct}} taste, mild odour and it boils at 586  K [10]. The hydroxyl group in ricinoleic acid (Fig.  4 a) account for the unique properties of castor oil. For instance, the oil has relatively high viscosity and specific gravity; it is soluble in alcohols in any proportion and has limited solubility in aliphatic petroleum solvents [11]. In addition, the polar hydroxyl group in castor oil makes it compatible with plasticizers {{of a wide variety}} of natural and synthetic resins, waxes, polymers and elastomers [12]. Notable changes on the properties of the castor oil can also be due to several factors such as the method of extraction, seed varieties, weather conditions and soil type. For instance, cold-pressed castor oils have low acid value, low iodine value and a slightly higher saponification value than <b>solvent-extracted</b> <b>oil</b> [1]. It has further been observed that castor seeds from different climatic conditions produce castor oils of different composition and physical–chemical properties [14, 15, 17]. Malaysian castor seeds for instance, contain total lipids (castor oil) reaching up to 43.3  % per dry weight and a saponification value of 182.96  mg KOH/g [14] while for the Nigerian castor seeds, the total lipids (castor oil) is 48  % per dry weight with a saponification value of 178.00  mg KOH/g [15].|$|E
40|$|Low {{viscosity}} {{base oils}} {{are one of}} the candidates for fuel saving lubricants for internal combustion engines. These lubricants reduce viscous friction under hydrodynamic conditions, so reduce total energy loss at tribological contact. However, these oils provide thinner oil films resulting in magnified wear. Therefore, wear protection of rubbing surfaces is very important to apply low viscosity oils in practice. Effects of phosphorus-containing additives on antiwear properties of low viscosity base oils were evaluated under boundary lubrication conditions using a four-ball type wear tester according to ASTM D 4172. For mineral based oils, dialkyl phosphonates considerably reduced wear whereas trialkyl and triaryl phosphonates did not. Compatibility of additive with mineral based oil depends on the refining process of the oil. Wear prevention by phosphorus-containing additive in <b>solvent-extracted</b> mineral <b>oils</b> was sometimes unpredictable. Additive response for hydrogen-refined mineral oils was better than that for <b>solvent-extracted</b> <b>oils.</b> The results showed good accordance with phosphorus contents on the worn surfaces obtained by surface analysis. At least 0. 062 mass% (620 ppm) of phosphorus is required to achieve sufficient antiwear properties in hydrogen-refined mineral oils. Synthetic esters have good lubricity in comparison with mineral oils. However, conventional antiwear additives for mineral oils are not always effective for synthetic esters, especially low viscosity esters. Hydroxyalkyl phosphates, with a polar functional group in the molecule, reduced wear effectively even at 0. 016 mass% (160 ppm) of phosphorus in low viscosity synthetic esters. The new additives provided boundary films with high phosphorus contents. Kinetics of the boundary film formation were examined by the electric contact resistance method. Formation of the boundary film from the new additives was higher than that from conventional additives. The replenishment process of the boundary film under dynamic conditions is very important for low viscosity lubricants...|$|R

Several in vitro studies suggest that garlic may decrease platelet aggregation. We aimed to test the acute effects of garlic on platelet aggregation in 14 healthy volunteers using a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover research method. The active agent tested was <b>solvent-extracted</b> garlic <b>oil</b> incubated in ethanol to obtain organosulphur compounds that demonstrate the highest antiplatelet activity when tested in vitro. Platelet aggregation was induced ex vivo by adrenaline, collagen or adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Four hours after consuming one large dose of oil derived from 9. 9 g garlic, there was little or no effect in the reduction of platelet aggregation.

Conventional TLC to separate phytosterol classes has a low recovery rate and is time-consuming. A new SPE method to separate phytosterol classes was developed with stepwise elution by increasing the polarity of the n-hexane:diethyl ether solvent mixture. Comparison of the results obtained for hazelnut and virgin olive oils with those of TLC revealed that the SPE method was faster and gave higher sterol recovery rates.

40|$|Nine {{varieties}} of virgin hazelnut oil from different autochthonous cultivars from distinct locations in Asturias (Spain) {{were obtained by}} extraction under a pressure of 280 kg/ cm 2 at a temperature of 45 °C. The extracted oils were separated and filtered. The overall composition (percentages of husk, oil and moisture) of unhusked seeds was determined as well as moisture, ash, total sulfur and heat power of the husks for their possible use as biomass. Recovery of the oil extraction procedure for its application {{to the production of}} extra virgin edible hazelnut oil was studied. Fatty acid, tocopherol and sterol compositions as determined by capillary column gas chromatography and triglyceride compositions as determined by high performance liquid chromatography are reported in this study.

40|$|According to European Union Regulation EC 1531 / 2001, {{olive oil}} {{labelled}} as oextra-virgino should be cold-pressed and contain no refined oil or oil from other oleaginous seeds or nuts. Adulteration of {{extra virgin olive}} oil (EVOO) with hazelnut oil (HAO) is a serious concern both for oil suppliers and consumers. The high degree of similarity between the two fats complicates the detection of low percentages of HAO in EVOO. Many analytical approaches have been developed in recent years to trace HAO in EVOO, principally based on chromatographic analyses, differential scanning calorimetry or nuclear magnetic resonance. In addition adulteration of EVOO with HAO may introduce hazelnut-derived allergens. The aim of this work was to analyse the protein and allergen content of EVOO intentionally spiked with raw cold-pressed HAO or solvent-extracted HAO. SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed the presence of hazelnut proteins in solvent-extracted HAO with molecular masses ranging 10 - 60 kDa. In contrast, cold-pressed HAO showed no traces of protein. In spiked EVOO, solvent-extracted HAO was still detectable at a 1 % contamination level. Several bands on SDS-PAGE migrated at apparent molecular masses coinciding with known allergens, such as Cor a 1 (17 kDa), Cor a 2 (14 kDa), Cor a 8 (12 kDa), oleosin (17 kDa) and Cor a 9 (60 kDa). MALDI-TOF MS analysis confirmed the presence of two oleosin isoforms and of Cor a 9. Immunoblotting demonstrated that an allergic patient with known reactivity to Cor a 1 and Cor a 2 recognized a 17 -kDa band in solvent-extracted HAO. In conclusion, we have shown that adulteration of extra virgin olive <b>oil</b> with <b>solvent-extracted</b> hazelnut <b>oil</b> can be traced by simple SDS-PAGE analysis, and that adulteration introduces a potential risk for hazelnut allergic patient...|$|R

Free and esterified forms of sterols provide detailed information on the identity and quality of vegetable oils, and therefore 4, 4 ´-dimethylsterols were investigated in hazelnut oil and virgin olive oil. A sample of <b>solvent-extracted</b> hazelnut <b>oil</b> was refined to monitor the effects of processing on 4, 4 ´-dimethylsterol levels and on specific marker compounds. Of the refining processes tested, only neutralisation and bleaching considerably reduced 4, 4 ´-dimethylsterols. In fully-refined hazelnut oil, losses of marker compounds in free form were higher than losses in their esterified form. GC-MS analysis showed that adulteration of olive oil with fully-refined hazelnut oil could be detected at levels of 2 % by tracing lupeol in total/esterified forms of 4, 4 ´-dimethylsterols. Olive oil has many applications in the food industry, e. g. blended with oils such as palm stearin to produce margarine or shortening by chemical interesterification. Investigation on lipid and minor lipid components of an olive oil-palm stearin blend during chemical interesterification showed that sterols were esterified with fatty acids at a higher level at 120 °C (7 %) than at 90 °C (4 %). Despite heat treatment and several steps to produce an interesterified product, there were minor losses in phytosterol and tocopherol contents and no significant increases in phytosterol oxidation...|$|R
