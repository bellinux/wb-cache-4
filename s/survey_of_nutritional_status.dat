Using the National <b>Survey</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nutritional</b> <b>Status</b> in Colombia - 2005 (ENSIN) and the Demographic and Health Survey - 2005 (DHS), this paper estimates the impact of nutrition on schooling outcomes. The results suggest that anemic children have a higher probability of lagging behind in school. Malnutrition, defined by anthropometric measures, does not have an impact on schooling lags. School attendance seems to be unrelated to nutrition measures. The results are consistent under different specifications. school attendance, schooling lag, nutrition, micronutrients...|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{trends in the}} <b>nutritional</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> children in EI Salvador between 1988 and 1993 (before and after the signing of a peace accord that ended the civil war.) The data derive from two national <b>surveys,</b> each <b>of</b> which included measurements of the height and weight of children aged 3 - 59 months. The prevalence of low weight-for-age (< - 2 SD) dropped from 15 % in 1988 to 10. 5 % in 1993. The prevalence of low weight-for-height (< - 2 SD) was minimal in both surveys: falling from 3. 9 % to 2. 9 %. The prevalence of low height-for-age (< - 2 SD) fell from 28. 1 % to 22 %. These declines in malnutrition indicators resulted from an upward shift in the distributions of weight and height of children, not from thinner lower tails of the distributions. The quality of anthropometric data appears to be high for both surveys: < 1 % <b>of</b> <b>surveyed</b> children had heights or weights outside the expected range.

In terms of health care indicators, Higher anaemia (57.8 % and 71.7 %), stunting (6.2 % and 21.7 %) and underweight (5.7 % and 9.2 %) rates, compared with the national averages (33.9 % in anaemia, 6.4 % in stunting and 4.0 % in underweight) for the rural areas, were found in Ledu County and Xundian County (Lu, 2011). Furthermore, caregivers usually lack of knowledge and information on nutrition and health care. Field investigations also disclosed that 3 – 5 year-old children in poor mountainous areas are almost in deprivation of the access to kindergartens. Insufficient schools faced a big challenge to accommodate huge population, {{since there are no}} qualified kindergartens in remote villages. Baseline surveys on 2 – 5 years old children’s cognitive and social development conducted by Peking University revealed a notably lower performance in Ledu County. Children scored 60 % lower than their urban counterparts in language, cognition and communication skills (CDRF’s Task Force, 2011 a). The prevalence of self-esteem, shyness, communication difficulties, personality problems were found in field investigations, and most of them do not want to communicate with the outside world, with only simple exchange of dialect language.|$|R

MÉTODOS: Se utilizó la base de datos de la Encuesta Nacional de la Situación Nutricional de Colombia, 2005. Los datos se obtuvieron por muestreo complejo representativo de la población y se procesaron con el programa SPSS, v. 15. Se seleccionaron mujeres en edad fértil con anemia y se clasificaron en dos grupos según la ferritina sérica. Se determinó la ingesta usual de nutrientes hematopoyéticos y el riesgo de deficiencia. Se compararon las proporciones de los tipos de anemia según las variables sociodemográficas utilizando la prueba F de Rao-Scott de segundo orden (P OBJECTIVES: Compare {{the nutritional}} origin of anemia by sociodemographic variables and analyze {{its association with}} deficient hematopoietic nutrient intake. METHODS: The database of Colombia's 2005 National <b>Survey</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nutritional</b> <b>Status</b> was used. The data were obtained through complex representative sampling {{of the population and}} processed using SPSS v. 15. Anemic women of childbearing age were selected and divided into two groups according to serum ferritin levels. Their customary hematopoietic nutrient intake and risk of deficiency were determined. The proportions of anemia types were compared by sociodemographic variables using the F-distribution, the Rao-Scott second order correction (P < 0. 05). The association between the origin of the anemia and classification of the nutrient was analyzed using the odds ratio (OR). RESULTS: Sample: 595 women. Non-hypoferric anemia (67. 2 %) predominated, with no statistical difference by sociodemographic variable, except in the Pacific region (hypoferric anemia, 52. 1 %). The prevalence of deficiency in the customary intake of hematopoietic nutrients was high. There was no significant association between the deficit in consumption and the origin of the anemia. CONCLUSIONS: Non-hypoferric anemia was most common, with no difference by sociodemographic indicators except in the Pacific region. All the women were at high risk of deficiency in their customary hematopoietic nutrient intake, but a statistically significant association between the deficiency and the origin of the nutritional anemia was not observed. Programs to improve nutrient intake and a continued search for causes of nutritional anemia other than iron deficiency are justified...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify social and economic factors associated with this difference in thinness and to explore the behavior in men and women that might underlie these associations. We compared men and women in 90 families in this part of Maharashtra by taking measurements of the height and weight of the married couple of child-bearing age in each family and assessing their social and economic details, fasting practices, and oil consumption. In this agricultural community, women were thinner in joint land-owning families, where the main occupation was farming, than those in nonfarming families. This was not true of men in this type of family. Men in "cash-rich" families had higher BMI than men in families without this characteristic. There was no corresponding difference in women's BMI. We then examined the lifestyles of men and women in a subset of 45 of these families. Women were more likely to work full time in farming than men, to carry the burden of all household chores, to have less sleep, and to eat less food away from home than men. Women fasted more frequently and more strictly than men. Despite identifying significant differences in behavior between men and women in the same household, we did not find a direct link between behavior and BMI. We conclude that being married into a farming family is an important factor in determining the thinness of a woman in rural Maharashtra...|$|R

Dietitians in 20 hospitals and six residential aged care facilities conducted single day <b>nutritional</b> <b>status</b> audits <b>of</b> 2208 acute and 839 aged care subjects using the Subjective Global Assessment. The effect <b>of</b> <b>nutritional</b> <b>status</b> on the presence, highest stage and number of pressure ulcers was determined by logistic regression in a model controlling for age, gender, medical specialty and facility location. The potential clustering effect of facility was accounted for in the model using an analysis of correlated data approach.

In Cirebon District has conducted periodic measurement {{of body weight}} at toddler groups to obtain information on <b>nutritional</b> <b>status</b> {{from time to time}} up to the district level. <b>Nutritional</b> <b>status</b> information is very useful to obtain a picture of nutrition problems of population size which in turn is used to support regional planning a regional program. PHC as one important element in monitoring the <b>nutritional</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> children at district level. However, generally in the center area of Cirebon toddlers data processing system that starts from the input, the determination <b>of</b> <b>nutritional</b> <b>status,</b> and storage is still done manually. This happened also in the PHC village, Cirebon Sea. Given the number of children so much, then the manual method is less effective and efficient, especially in the process <b>of</b> determining the <b>nutritional</b> <b>status</b> <b>of</b> the filing and storage cabinets that need a place wide enough, and toddler data search process that requires a relatively long time. Therefore, the author wants to facilitate that process by creating a computerized information system that can provide solutions to those problems...|$|R

This {{is consistent with previous}} studies which reported a limited correlation between objective nutritional assessment and subjective assessment, based on trained dieticians and on a detailed tool [25]. Therefore, this subjective assessment <b>of</b> <b>nutritional</b> <b>status</b> cannot be recommended.|$|R
