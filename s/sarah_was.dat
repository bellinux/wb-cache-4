5|$|Anne had {{explained}} before {{that she did}} not wish the public to know that her relationship with <b>Sarah</b> <b>was</b> failing, because any sign that <b>Sarah</b> <b>was</b> out of favour would have a damaging impact on the Duke of Marlborough's authority as Captain-General. <b>Sarah</b> <b>was</b> kept in all of her offices – purely for the sake of her husband's position as Captain-General of the army – and the tension between the two women lingered on until early in 1711. This year was to see the end of their relationship for good.|$|E
5|$|In 1702, King William III died, and Anne became Queen. Anne {{immediately}} offered John Churchill a dukedom, which Sarah initially refused. <b>Sarah</b> <b>was</b> {{concerned that}} a dukedom would strain the family's finances; a ducal {{family at the}} time was expected to show off its rank through lavish entertainments. Anne countered by offering the Marlboroughs a pension of £5000 a year, for life, from Parliament, as well as an extra £2000 a year from the Privy Purse, and they accepted the Dukedom. <b>Sarah</b> <b>was</b> promptly created Mistress of the Robes (the highest office in the royal court that could be held by a woman), Groom of the Stole, Keeper of the Privy Purse, and Ranger of Windsor Great Park. The Duke accepted the Order of the Garter, as well as the office of Captain-General of the army.|$|E
5|$|In January 1711, <b>Sarah</b> <b>was</b> {{stripped}} of {{the offices of}} Mistress of the Robes and Groom of the Stole and replaced by Elizabeth Seymour, Duchess of Somerset.

5|$|<b>Sarah</b> <b>was</b> {{called to}} Cambridge in 1703, where her only {{surviving}} son, John, Marquess of Blandford, was taken ill with smallpox. The Duke of Marlborough was recalled {{from the war}} and was at his bedside when he died on 20 February 1703. <b>Sarah</b> <b>was</b> heartbroken {{over the loss of}} her son and became reclusive for a period, expressing her grief by closing herself off from Anne and either not answering her letters or doing so in a cold and formal manner. However, Sarah did not allow Anne to shut her out when Anne suffered bereavement. After the death of Anne's husband, Prince George of Denmark in 1708, Sarah arrived, uninvited, at Kensington Palace to find Anne with the prince's body. She pressed the heartbroken Queen to move from Kensington to St James's Palace in London, which Anne bluntly refused, and instead commanded Sarah to call Abigail Masham to attend her. Aware that Abigail was gaining more influence with Anne, Sarah disobeyed her, and instead scolded her for grieving over Prince George's death. Although Anne eventually submitted and allowed herself to be taken to St James's Palace, Sarah's insensitivity greatly offended her and added to the already significant strain on the relationship.|$|E
50|$|Abimelech {{tells the}} story of Abraham and Sarah at Gerar (Genesis 20) in three acts. Although there are {{multiple}} versions of the story with different characters, Smart relies on the version in which Abraham pretends that <b>Sarah</b> <b>is</b> his sister, and the king of Gerar, Abimilech, wishes to marry her. God intervenes by telling Abimelech that <b>Sarah</b> <b>is</b> married and should be returned to Abraham; Abimelech returns Sarah to Abraham but criticizes Abraham for lying. The oratorio leaves out the final portion of Abimelech's biblical story in which <b>Sarah</b> <b>is</b> made fertile by God along with Abimelech's women.|$|R

5|$|<b>Sarah</b> <b>was</b> {{famous for}} telling the Queen {{exactly what she}} thought, and did not offer her flattery.

Effectively a business manager, Sarah had control over the Queen's position, from her finances to people admitted to the royal presence.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sarah</b> <b>was</b> {{relieved}} {{to move back}} to England.

Henrietta eventually married Thomas Pelham-Holles, first Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, in April 1717, and the rest of Sarah's grandchildren went on to make successful marriages.|$|E

5|$|Holmes {{was born}} in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on August 29, 1809.

He was the first son of Abiel Holmes (1763–1837), {{minister}} of the First Congregational Church and avid historian, and Sarah Wendell, Abiel's second wife. <b>Sarah</b> <b>was</b> the daughter of a wealthy family, and Holmes was named for his maternal grandfather, a judge.

5|$|Other {{problems}} also emerged. In 1689, Anne's supporters (including the Marlboroughs and the Duke of Somerset) {{demanded that}} she be granted a parliamentary annuity of £50,000, a sum that would end her dependence on William and Mary. <b>Sarah</b> <b>was</b> seen as {{the driving force behind}} this bill, creating further ill-feeling towards her at court. William responded to the demand by offering the same sum from the Privy Purse, to keep Anne dependent on his generosity. However, Anne, through Sarah, refused, pointing out that a parliamentary grant would be more secure than charity from the Privy Purse. Eventually Anne received the grant from Parliament, and felt she owed this to Sarah's efforts.|$|E
