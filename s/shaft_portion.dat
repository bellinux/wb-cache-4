In detail, the sealing assembly includes the port having a circular shaped end with a circular shaped knife-edge thereon. The sealing assembly further includes a hollow cap having a closed first end with an aperture therethrough and an open second end.

40|$|First, back-up rolls {{for rolling}} require toughness, {{particularly}} in the <b>shaft</b> <b>portion,</b> and high-hardness in the sleeve portion. The back-up rolls are classified into two types; one is a single-solid type, {{and the other is}} a shrink-fitted construction type consisting of a sleeve and an arbor. The shrink- fitted back up roll has several advantages, for example, different materials can be chosen and the arbor can be reused by replacing the damaged sleeve. Therefore, the shrink-fitted back-up rolls are economical. However, residual deflection becomes a major problem for the shrink-fitted back-up roll. Elucidating the mechanism of the occurrence of residual deflection and devising countermeasures are important issues. Unfortunately conducting a real experiment is difficult because of much time and huge cost. In this paper, we reproduce this phenomenon by elastic FEM analysis, establish a simulation method, and elucidate the mechanism behind underlying residual deflection...|$|E

40|$|A {{mathematical}} modelling of a shaft-hub press-fit subjected to bending couples {{applied to the}} shaft extremities is developed, {{and the value of}} the bending couple inducing an un- desired shaft-hub incipient detachment is analytically determined. The shaft-hub contact is modelled in terms of two elastic Timoshenko beams connected by a distributed elastic spring, whose stiffness is analytically evaluated. Two models of the distributed spring are considered. The first model expresses the combined deformability of both the shaft and the hub cross sections. The second model accounts for the stiffening effect exerted by the <b>shaft</b> <b>portion</b> protruding from the hub on the adjacent shaft part that is in contact with the hub, and, consequently, it assumes only a rigid body motion of the shaft cross section, thus neglecting its deformability. Based upon this beam-like model, the bending couple producing the incipient detach- ment between the shaft and the hub is theoretically determined in term of the shaft-hub geometry, of the initial shaft-hub interference, and of the elastic constants. Comparisons with selected Finite Element (FE) forecasts indicate that the first modelling produces an incipient detachment couple that appreciably overrates the FE forecasts, whereas the sec- ond modelling lowers the error down to technically acceptable predictions...|$|E

As bone distribution/organization locally reflects the nature, direction, frequency, and magnitude of such loads, measures of topographic variation of the cortical shell {{can be used as a}} proxy for assessing the taxon-specific dynamic relationships individual-biomechanical environment. Based on the assumption that variation of local morphometric properties along the femoral diaphysis relates to functional levels and patterns of habitual physical activity, primarily to locomotion, we characterized the human and chimpanzee conditions through virtual rendering of their respective endostructural signatures. By using the CT-based record from 20 modern human and 12 chimpanzee adult femurs, we imaged the site-specific changes in cortical bone through standardized morphometric maps generated by virtually unzipping and vertically unrolling each shaft along the middle of its anterior aspect within the portion 20 - 80 % of the biomechanical length. The analyses were coupled with the comparative assessment of cross-sectional geometric properties. Compared to Pan, the human femoral diaphysis is more robust (CA and PCA) and presents a higher Ix/Iy ratio in the midshaft region. In both taxa, thickness distribution is not uniform, but widely and unequally changes vertically along the diaphysis and horizontally according to different projections. In chimpanzee, a strong medial and lateral reinforcement is found in the proximal part of the shaft, while in humans it occurs posteriorly.

40|$|The City of Rochester {{plans to}} {{excavate}} the Culver-Goodman tunnel and connect {{it to the}} existing Cross-Irondequoit tunnel through a control structure. Several dropshafts will convey the effluent from surface collection facilities to the storage and conveyance tunnel. The function of these dropshafts is to transport the water from one elevation and energy level to a lower elevation and energy level and, in the process, to dissipate energy and remove the entrained air. The term "dropshaft" is sometimes used collectively to include the various components of the structure. Conduits {{at or near the}} ground surface collect the water and convey it to an elbow which deflects the flow about 90 degrees into the vertical drop shaft. The vertical shaft is divided by a slotted wall which separates the falling water-air mixture and the released air returning to the surface. In the elbow and vertical shaft the falling water entrains considerable amounts of air and gains kinetic energy. The vertical shaft terminates in a sump, which is a large excavated and lined chamber. The purpose of the sump is to dissipate some of the energy, to remove and co~lect the entrained air, and to direct the water at a reduced velocity into the exit conduit. The sloping roof of the sump guides the collected air back to the vent side of the vertical <b>shaft.</b> A <b>portion</b> of the rising air is drawn through the slots in the divider wall and re-ยท entrained in the falling water; the excess air returns to the surface.
