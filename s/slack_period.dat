In a manufacturing firm, there are certain functions to be performed, such as maintenance or clerical work (often overhead type functions), where again the potential service level is expensive to change. In fact, even in the case of production workers, the expense of hiring, training, firing, or the contractual obligations of guaranteed wage agreements may make it undesirable to change the level of employment during <b>slack</b> <b>periods.</b> The reader will readily find further illustrations of the type of planning problems we are describing here. ...|$|R

30|$|By observing memory {{operations}} like memget, memput, and memcpy, Gamell et al. in [1] identify <b>slack</b> <b>periods</b> of partitioned global {{address space}} (PGAS) applications during these operations. By exploiting these <b>slack</b> <b>periods,</b> the authors propose a power management middleware to allow adjusting the power configuration at both PGAS application and runtime layers. The runtime layer makes decisions for power configurations {{based on the}} combination of predefined thresholds and adaptive thresholds based on the history. At the application layer, the middleware allows the programmer to use language extensions to define different power/performance policies including maximum performance, balance power/performance, minimum power, and maximum power reduction. The middleware is facilitated with a power controller to dynamically adjust the voltage and frequency depending on the power configuration. To achieve the desired configuration, the power controller can operate in different modes including asynchronous adjusting both the voltage and frequency (DVFS) or adjusting only the frequency (DFS).|$|R

40|$|The {{majority}} of Thailand’s population lies {{in rural areas}} where farming activities generally play an important role. Improvement of farming systems could directly improve {{the standard of living}} of families, therefore, solving the obstacles of farming systems is crucial. However, little has been done to encourage problem solving in farming systems from the view of farmers. The paper first identifies the obstacles of the existing farming systems and then proposes ways and means to solve those problems from the perspective of farmers. The supply situation of food, health care, water and housing was, in general, satisfactory for the families in Northern Thailand. There were common problems in all families in terms of farm resources such as degradation of soil fertility, poor management or lack of irrigation systems, and unemployment during <b>slack</b> <b>periods</b> of cultivation. In addition, most farmers reported drought as the main problem of farming. Therefore, improving irrigation management, as well as the distribution of information, on improving soil fertility, perhaps through extension services, are suggested. As well, enhancing local job opportunities, especially during <b>slack</b> <b>periods</b> of cultivation would be beneficial...|$|R

Continuing this practice, Johnson built six parlor organs of increased size during the next three winters. In 1847, he decided to accept only construction contracts that could be finished by the fall so that he could close his construction business and devote all of his time to the building of pipe organs.|$|E
50|$|Slack {{water is}} a much misused term, often used to {{describe}} a period of equilibrium between two opposing streams when the {{water is a}}nything but slack, but highly stressed. Although {{there may be no}} flow in either direction there may be many eddies, and since this so-called slack water occurs before high water while the tide is still rising, the tide may continue to rise even after the direction of the stream has reversed. Conversely, since it occurs after low water while the tide is rising, the tide may also continue to rise during this so-called low water <b>slack</b> <b>period.</b> Such conditions typically occur at river mouths, or in straits open at both ends where their entrances have markedly different physical characteristics. Examples include The Rip between Point Nepean and Point Lonsdale at the entrance to Port Philip Bay, Victoria, Australia; the Menai Strait between Anglesey and Wales; or the Strait of Gibraltar {{at the entrance to the}} Mediterranean Sea.|$|E

The Fairyland Lustre line proved immensely popular across the Atlantic during the Roaring 20s, providing Wedgwood a popular and pricey product with which to penetrate the lucrative American market. But soon Makeig-Jones' Art Nouveau fairies faded from fashion. Dawes says it was no surprise that the line was discontinued in 1929.|$|E

50|$|While IRC's radio {{business}} was initially successful, {{it was generally}} seasonal in nature; due to better reception in winter as well as general patterns of behavior before the widespread adoption of air conditioning, sales of radios were much higher {{during the winter months}} than during the summer.

The ruling class of this society is generally a semi-theocratic aristocracy which claims to be the incarnation of gods on earth. The forces of production associated with this society include basic agricultural techniques, massive construction and storage of goods for social benefit (granaries).|$|E

There were booms in prices paid to native planters through severe competition among buying firms at certain times. At <b>slack</b> <b>periods</b> there was an extreme fall in price. To improve this situation a purchase system was devised which guaranteed tea merchants sufficient raw material of a consistently good quality at a reasonable price and guaranteed native planters a sufficient outlet for their product Ott a price related to the price of dry tea on the world market.

40|$|A {{great many}} machines, from {{personal}} workstations to large clusters, are under utilized. Meanwhile, for {{the fear of}} slowing down the native tasks, resource scavenging systems hesitate to aggressively harness idle resources. We have developed a quantitative approach for fine-grained scavenging that can effectively utilizes very small <b>slack</b> <b>periods</b> without adversely impacting the native workload, and automatically adapts {{to changes in the}} native workload’s resource consumption. This paper envisions a generic framework, built upon the above approach, that facilitates the sharing of machines between a primary and a secondary workloads, providing a unified view of the diverse systems where idle resources are available. In such a framework the primary workload performance is bounded by a configurable slowdown factor (i. e., 5 %) and the secondary workload aggressively utilizes the slack left by the primary workload. Thus our proposed framework creates a novel resourcesharing paradigm that results in greater resource utilization without sacrificing the performance of the primary workload. ...|$|R

30|$|The {{ability of}} {{manufacturing}} system {{to adjust the}} volume of production (supply) as per the customers demand is termed as volume flexibility. Manufacturer should be in position {{to meet the demand}} of variety of products at peak level at rapid rate with competitive price and also remain efficient during <b>slack</b> <b>period.</b> Hence, small batch size (ideally single piece flow) is preferable. Flexible assembly line is desirable in this case. Thus, JIT offers the flexibility to the organization and keeps the manufacturing system in synchronization with its ever changing environmental conditions. A flexible work force and flexible machines both are equally vital to achieve JIT manufacturing. The operators should be multi-skilled and machine/equipment must be set up as quickly as possible to cope up with small lot size of variety of products. Since, volume flexibility practices can help in achieving reliable delivery, we can start implementation of this bundle simultaneously with conformance quality practices.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{examines}} both theoretically and empirically {{the factors}} determining {{the demand for}} regular labour in seasonal agriculture. In an implicit contract framework {{it is argued that}} there are ‘hoarding costs’ of regular labour in the <b>slack</b> <b>period</b> when there is not much work to be done. Consequently, the number of regular labour employed is constrained by the hoarding cost where larger employment-intensive farms tend to hire more regular labour. Evidence from the ICRISAT villages in India, too, show that though the marginal costs of regular labour are zero, there are significant hoarding costs of regular labour among small farms so that larger farmers are the major demanders of regular labour. Estimates of the double-hurdle model jointly determining the probability of hiring regular labour and demand for regular labour-hours (if a regular labour is hired) are shown to be an improvement over univariate tobit estimates of the demand for regular labour-hours only...|$|E
30|$|The {{findings}} {{revealed that}} substantial {{parts of the}} study area have been converted from cereal crop production system to agroforestry land use which enables the community to diversify their income. Farm households allocate their labour time for non-farming activities during the <b>slack</b> <b>periods.</b> Subsequently, the household-level synergies have occurred when the farm households’ adoption decision to engage in agroforestry activities have coincided with the participation in non-farm income generating activities. This simultaneous participation decision by the farm households enables them to acquire resources that otherwise would not be accessible to maximise farm households economic returns. Therefore, this study has confirmed that agroforestry practices have been conducted by the farm households not only just from the comparative economic return (from the customary food crop farming) it has but also from the synergetic effect it has with the non-farm income generating activities. Furthermore, farmers allocate their labour time for non-farming activities, notably for the transportation of eucalyptus tree products and other commodities, after planting their farm plots with trees, which is relatively less labour intensive than the annual food crop farming systems.|$|R
