40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project has been to {{investigate}} the mechanism of hepatitis C virus/lipoprotein complexes of lipo-viro-particles (LVP) derived from transplanted liver macerates of an HCV infected immunodeficient patient (S 6 b) and density-fractionated from an iodixanol gradient. Previous {{studies have indicated that}} serum derived HCV may bind to hepatocytes via the LDL-receptor (LDLr) or the scavenger receptor SR-B 1. The role of these receptors in the uptake of LLVP in HepG 2 cells was investigated by comparing LLVP uptake with that of dioctadecylindocarbocyanine-labeled-low density lipoprotein (DiI-LDL) and similarly labeled oxidized LDL (DiI-oxLDL), know to be taken up predominantly via the LDLr and SR-B 1 respectively. DiI-LDL and DiI-oxLDL binding resembled that of LLVP in being significantly increased by insulin and LPDS treatment. DiI-LDL but not DiI-oxLDL binding was also decreased by hydroxycholesterol. These results suggest that all three lipoprotein particles may be taken up via the LDLr which binds predominantly via apolipoprotein B 100. To confirm this, the inhibition of binding studies were conducted. Whilst binding of DiI-LDL was reduced by 98 % by pre-incubation with anti-apoB 100 antibodies, binding of both LLVP and DiI-oxLDL was enhanced. Using confocal microscopy and FACS analysis, we compared the role of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the binding of the three particles types by washing cells with <b>suramine,</b> previously shown to remove GAG bound-LDL. Like LLVP, DiI-LDL bound at 0 degrees Celsius was washed off with <b>suramine</b> but became resistant at 37 degrees Celsius. In contrast, washing off DiI-oxLDL with <b>suramine</b> at both 0 degrees Celsius and 37 degrees Celsius had no significant effect. The binding patterns of LLVP therefore differ from those of DiI-LDL and DiI-oxLDL. To investigate whether such differences might be due to viral glycoprotein E 2, the effect of polyclonal antibody to E 2 and a monoclonal antibody to the E 2 -hypervariable region (HVR 1) on binding of LLVP to HepG 2 cells was assessed. Neither anti-E 2 nor anti-HVR 1 blocked binding. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceMalaysian Government : Wellcome TrustGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} {{importance of}} purines and purinreceptors for hypertension and its pathophysiology is being discussed more intensively {{in the last}} years. In this study, we have investigated the role of P 2 X-receptors, especially P 2 X 1 and P 2 X 3. Using RT-PCR, we have investigated the expression of mRNA of all known P 2 X-receptors in the kidney of the rat, subdevided into renal artery, medullary and cortical tissues. Using specific P 2 X-receptor antagonists as pyridoxalphosphate- 6 -azophenyl- 2 ?, 4 ?-disulfonate (PPADS), <b>suramine</b> and naphthalene- 1, 3, 5 -trisulphonic acid (NF 023), we have investigated the role of P 2 X 1 and P 2 X 3 receptors in the rat isolated perfused kidney. We could demonstrate the presence of P 2 X 1, P 2 X 2, P 2 X 3, P 2 X 4 and P 2 X 7 in the cortical and the medullary part of the kidney. In the renal artery we could show the presence of P 2 X 1, P 2 X 2 and P 2 X 7. Specific P 2 X-receptor agonists as alphabeta-me-ATP (alpha, beta-meATP), diadenosinehexaphophates (Ap 6 A) and adenosin-guanosin-hexaphosphat (Ap 6 G) were capable to induce vasoconstriction in the vasculature of the kidney. By using the specific P 2 X-receptorantagonists PPADS, <b>suramine</b> and NF 023 we could show that this vasoconstriction is mediated by P 2 X 1 and especially by P 2 X 3. In summary, this study shows the evidence {{for the presence of}} the P 2 X 3 -receptor in the kidney. Using specific P 2 X-receptorantagonists, it could be shown that the P 2 X 3 -receptor is involved in the regulation of blood pressure control and {{plays an important role in}} glomerular perfusion and the development of hypertension...|$|E

40|$|Cerebellar granule cells (CGCs) {{explanted}} {{in vitro}} undergo death via apoptosis when {{the concentration of}} potassium is shifted from 25 mM to 5 mM. We report that adenosine and ADP, which act as neurotransmitters and neuromodulators in the brain, exert in cultured cerebellar granule cells a specific and marked antiapoptotic action with half-maximal effect in the 10 - 100 microM range. The action of adenosine is partly inhibited by the A 1 AR antagonist 8 -cyclopentyl- 1, 3 -dipropylxanthine (DPCPX) and is mimicked by the A 1 AR agonist 2 -chloro-N 6 -cyclopentyladenosine (CCPA), while ADP effect, that is completely blocked by the P 2 x, P 2 y receptors noncompetitive antagonist <b>suramine,</b> is restored {{in the presence of}} the selective P 2 x purinoceptors agonist beta, gamma-methylene-L-ATP.

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that electrical field stimulation (EFS) -induced contraction is mediated by a cholinergic mechanism and other neurotransmitters. NO, ATP, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and substance P are released by EFS. To investigate the purinergic mechanism {{involved in the}} EFS-induced contraction, purinegic receptors antagonists were used. <b>Suramine,</b> a non-selective P 2 receptor antagonist, reduced the contraction induced by EFS. NF 023 (10 - 7 ~ 10 - 4 M), a selective P 2 X antagonist, inhibited the contraction evoked by EFS. Reactive blue (10 - 6 ~ 10 - 4 M), selective P 2 Y antagonist, also blocked the contraction in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, P 2 X agonist α,β-methylene 5 '-adenosine triphosphate (αβMeATP, 10 - 7 ~ 10 - 5 M) potentiated EFS-induced contraction in a dose-dependent manner. P 2 Y agonist adenosine 5 '-[β-thio]diphosphate trilithium salt (ADPβS, 10 - 7 ~ 10 - 5 M) also potentiated EFS-induced contractions in a dose-dependent manner. Ecto-ATPase activator apyrase (5 and 10 U/ml) reduced EFS-induced contractions. Inversely, 6 -N,N-diethyl-D-β,γ-dibromomethylene 5 '-triphosphate triammonium (ARL 67156, 10 - 4 M) increased EFS-induced contraction.

40|$|Abstract. Chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) is an {{important}} receptor for Plasmodium falciparum−infected erythrocytes in the placenta. To study the molecular interaction between parasitized erythrocytes (PE) to CSA, we performed in vitro cytoadherence inhibition assays of PE infected with wild and laboratory isolates of P. falciparum to CSA using various glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Marked decrease in PE adhesion to immobilized CSA and CSA-expressed cells was achieved with soluble chondroitin sulfate D (CSD) and chondroitin sulfate E (CSE) at low concentrations. The effect was dose dependent with the degree of inhibition exceeded that of soluble CSA in certain clinical isolates. The results suggested the influence of oversulfation of CS variant chains on PE adherence to CSA. Interestingly, PE of the tested wild isolates could adhere to immobilized CSD and CSE at different levels while PE of CSA-selected laboratory lines could not. Partial inhibitory activity was observed when chondroitin sulfate C (CSC), chondroitin sulfate B (CSB), and polyolpolysulfate were used even at high concentrations. Keratan sulfate, colominic acid, and <b>Suramine</b> were unable to inhibit PE adherence.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the growth-inducing effects of endothelial-secreted UP 4 A on smooth vascular muscles cells. Thereby, a pharmacological characterization is conducted on the P 2 X and P 2 Y receptors involved. Dinucleoside polyphosphates are of great importance in the cardiovascular system. They not only have strong vasoconstrictive effects within the renal vascular system but also function as potential growth-inducing factors. Dinucleoside polyphosphates operate {{through a variety of}} receptors, with P 2 X and P 2 Y receptors being the most important ones. In 2005, a new dinucleoside polyphosphate was identified, consisting of purine (adenosine) and pyramidine (uridine). This dinucleoside polyphosphate is uridine adenosine tetraphosphate (UP 4 A). UP 4 A is a potential growth-inducing factor leading to a doses and time dependent proliferation on smooth vascular muscle cells, reaching its maximum growth-inducing effect at an incubation time of 36 h and a UP 4 A concentration of 1 µmol/l. After the incubation of smooth vascular muscle cells with <b>suramine</b> (a non-selective P 2 X and P 2 Y antagonist), PPADS (a non-selective P 2 X and P 2 Y antagonist), NFO 23 (a nonselective P 2 X and P 2 Y antagonist) and RB 2 (a non-selective P 2 Y antagonist), the growth-inducing effect of UP 4 A decreases significantly. However, the effects of these purine receptor antagonists are not reduced completely. This leads to the assumption that the proliferating effects might also operate through other means, e. g. using receptors. Also, adding the selective P 2 Y 1 antagonist does not reduce the growthinducing effect of UP 4 A. Conclusively, the P 2 Y 6 receptor must be centrally involved in the proliferation-increasing process. In summary, {{it can be said that}} UP 4 A is the first dinucleoside polyphosphate combination that has a potent growth-inducing factor for smooth vascular muscle cells. Its proliferating effects are probably transmitted primarily via activating P 2 Y receptors...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{antibacterial}} agent taurolidine {{has been shown}} to exhibit antineoplastic effects both in vitro and in animal models. Resistance towards established cytotoxic agens is a typical feature of pancreatic cancer. Inhibition of programmed cell death was identfied as an important mechanism of drug resistance in cancer cells. Firstly in this study the effect of taurolidine in monotherapy and in combination with gemcitabine, docetaxel and suramin on viabilitiy and proliferation of 3 different pancreatic cancer cell lines has been evaluated. Deriving from the results of {{the first part of this}} investigation, the combinatory treatment with taurolidine and gemcitabine was choosen to conduct a further analysis of key regulators of apoptosis. Mitochondrial apoptosis was investigated by assessment of anti-apototic protein bcl- 2 and pro-apoptotic protein bax. The influence of taurolidine on c-flip, which is a regulator of death-receptor mediated apoptosis in pancreatic cancer, was also assessed. Materials and Methods: Ductal pancreatic cancer cell lines: AsPC- 1 human, HPAF- 2 (human) and DSL- 6 A (rat). Cells were incubated for 24 h and 72 h with taurolidine (100 μM- 500 μM), or with taurolidine (100 μM and 200 μM) in combination with gemcitabine (100 μM), docetaxel (0, 03 µg and 0, 3 µg) or <b>suramine</b> (10 µg and 100 µg) Proliferation and viability were investigated by cell counting and MTT assay. Apoptosis in general was analyzed by caspase 3 / 7 assay. Expression of bcl- 2, bax and c-flip were assessed by western blot analysis. Results: Taurolidine in monotherapy and combination with different antineoplastic agents inhibited cell growth and viability significantly in all investigated pancreatic cancer cell lines. Combinatory treatment with taurolidine and gemcitabine in a further reduction of proliferation. As revealed by caspase 3 / 7 assay, combinatory treatment with taurolidine and gemcitabine (vs. gemcitabine monotherapy) was highly effective in apoptosis induction. Cell line specific, expression of anti-apoptotic proteins bcl- 2 and c-flip decreased, whereas an increase of pro-apoptotic bax was observed. Conclusion: Taurolidine might be a promising sensitizer for established antineoplastic agents as well as for new death receptor agonistic therapies in pancreatic cancer...|$|E
40|$|P 2 receptors are {{endowed with}} a number of {{biological}} effect, which are of extreme interest as targets for new drugs. P 2 receptor structure and functions are still not known in deep, and new highly efficacious and selective ligands (both agonists and antagonists) are needed, since they are at an early stage of development. The scopes of our research has been the discovery and development of potent P 2 ligands, with the aim at designing selective pharmacological probes and potential drugs targeting P 2 receptor subtypes. On this purpose, this thesis reports on two related topics: the preparation and testing of 2 -alkynyl ATP analogs as potential P 2 agonists; catalogues data mining for identification, purification and testing of polysulphonated dyes as analogues of Reactive Blue 2, and preparation and testing of new RB- 2 and suramin analogues as potential P 2 antagonists As regard as the first topic, a new series of nucleotides with activity on human platelet aggregation and adenylyl cyclase modulation through the interaction with P 2 Y 1 and P 2 Y 12 receptors has been prepared and well characterized. The di- and thriphosphates of 2 - hexynyladenosine (HEADP, 73, and HEATP, 75) are partial agonists at P 2 Y 1 and agonists at P 2 Y 12 receptors while both the monophosphates (HEAMP, 71, and PEAMP, 72) and the di- and thriphosphates of 2 -phenyletynyladenosine (PEADP, 74, and PEATP, 76) mainly antagonize the P 2 Y 1 receptor. The surprisingly different behaviour of the diphosphates 73 and 74 (figure 18), which differ from structure point of view only for a portion of the alkynyl chain, cannot be explained by different hydrolysis rates, but in terms of different size and flexibility of the substituents in the position 2 of the purine base. With regard to analogues of Reactive Blue 2 and suramin, with this work we have succeded in the chromatographic separation of isomeric mixture of RB 2. Furthermore, we have prepared a number of RB 2 and <b>suramine</b> analogues, which have been tested for their ability of counteracting the toxic effect of hypoglicemia. Some of tested compounds behave as protecting agents, being at least equiactive with RB 2, and being among the most active compounds of this category...|$|E
40|$|Ziele: Die Ca 2 +-Konzentrationserhöhung ist ein Kofaktor von vielen Zellprozessen einschließlich Apoptose und Nekrose. Die Hypothese von dieser Studie war, dass blutiger zerebrospinaler Liquor (bCSF) von Patienten nach intraventrikulärer Blutung einen Ca 2 +- Anstieg verursachen konnte, der Apoptose oder Nekrose in humanen Astrozyten induziert. Methode: Humane Astrozyten wurden mit bCSF inkubiert. In Kontrollexperimenten wurde nativer zerebrospinaler Liquor (nCSF) verwendet. Die zytosolischen Ca 2 +-Konzentration von den einzelnen Zellen wurde mit dem Ca 2 +- sensitiven Farbstoffe (Fura- 2) gemessen. Vier Blocker wurden verwendet: Nimodipin (LTyp- Calciumkanale Hemmer), 2 -aminoethoxydiphenyl-borate (2 APB) (IP 3 - Rezeptorenblocker des endoplasmatischen Retikulums), Suramin (P 2 - Rezeptorenantagonist), D (-) - 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonopentanoic-acid (2 A 5 P) (NMDARezeptorblocker), und Cyclosporin A (MPTP-Inhibitor). Zur Messung von Nekrose und Apoptose wurden Astrozyten mit Hoechst- 33342 und Propidium Iodid markiert. Die Ergenisse der vorgelegten Arbeit zeigen: 1) dass blutiger zerebrospinaler Liquor Nekrose in humanen Astrozyten induziert und dass die zytosolische Ca 2 +-Konzentrationserhöhung eine wichtige Rolle bei der Entstehung von bCSF-induzierter Nekrose spielt, 2) dass die zytosolische Ca 2 +-Konzentrationserhöhung und die Nekrose von der Aktivierung P 2 -Rezeptoren und IP 3 -abhängiger Ca 2 +-Kanäle am endoplasmatischen Retikulum abhängig sind, 3) dass eine Blockade der P 2 -Rezeptoren durch Suramin den Ca 2 +-Anstieg und die Nekroserate reduziert, während NMDA-Blockade durch D(-) - 2 -Amino- 5 - Phosphonopentanoic Acid keine signifikante Veränderung auf den Ca 2 +-Anstieg bzw. die Nekroserate bewirkt, 4) dass der ATP-Gehalt in bCSF gegenüber nCSF um ungefähr das 400 -fache erhöht ist, 5) dass eine Hemmung der Ca 2 +-Kanäle vom L-Typ durch Nimodipine zu einer geringen aber gerade signifikanten Verringerung des Ca 2 +-Anstiegs und der Nekroserate führt, 6) dass eine Blockade der IP 3 -Rezeptoren durch 2 APB den Ca 2 +-Anstieg und die Nekroserate reduziert, und dass eine Blockade der MPTP durch Cyclosporin A zur signifikanten Nekrose-Reduktion ohne Einfluss auf die zytosolische Ca 2 +-Kinetik führt. Schlussfolgerung: Blutiger zerebrospinaler Liquor verursacht Nekrose in humanen Astrozyten. Die bCSFinduzierte Nekrose wird durch einen zytosolischen Ca 2 +-Anstieg verursacht, der durch Ca 2 +-Freisetzung aus dem ER zustande kommt. Diese Ca 2 +-Freisetzung wird durch die Aktivierung der P 2 Y-Rezeptoren durch ATP vermittelt. Aims: An {{increase}} in cellular Ca 2 + concentration is a cofactor of many cellular processes including apoptosis and necrosis. This study&# 1765; s hypothesis was that hemorrhagic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients after intraventricular hemorrhage may cause an {{increase in}} Ca 2 + concentration which induces apoptosis or necrosis in an in-vitro model of human cerebral astrocytes. Method: Human astrocytes were incubated with CSF from patients with intraventicular hemorrhage. In control experiments native CSF was used. Cytosolic Ca 2 +-concentrations were measured in single cells by fura- 2. Four pharmakological blockers were used: Nimodipine, 2 -aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2 APB), <b>suramine,</b> D (-) - 2 -Amino- 5 -Phosphonopentanoic-Acid (2 A 5 P), and cyclosporin A, that block the L-type Ca 2 +-channel, the endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + channels, the ATPsensitive PY 2 -receptor, the NMDA-receptor, and the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP), respectively. Apopotosis and necrosis were evaluated by staining the cells with Hoechst- 3342 and propidium iodide. The major {{findings of this study}} are : 1) the fact that bloody cerebrospinal fluid induces necrosis and not apoptosis in human astrocytes. The increase of cytosolic Ca 2 +-concentration {{plays an important role in}} the bCSF-induced necrosis. 2) the fact that the increase of cytosolic Ca 2 +-concentration and the necrosis are dependent on the activation P 2 receptors and IP- 3 dependent Ca 2 + channels of the endoplasmic reticulum. 3) the fact that blocking the P 2 receptors by suramin reduces the Ca 2 + increase and the necrosis rate, while blocking of NMDA receptors by D (-) - 2 -Amino- 5 - phosphonopentanoic acid causes no significant change in the Ca 2 + increase or the necrosis rate. 4) the fact that the ATP content is 400 -fold higher in bCSF as compared to nCSF. 5) the fact that an inhibition of the L- type Ca 2 + channels with Nimodipine leads to a significant reduction of the Ca 2 + increase and the rate of necrosis. 6) the fact that a blockade of the IP 3 receptors by 2 APB reduces the Ca 2 + increase and the necrosis rate, and that a blockade of the MPTP by Cyclosporin A leads to significant reduction of the necrosis without significant influence on cytosolic Ca 2 + kinetics. Conclusion: Bloody CSF induces necrosis but not apoptosis in human astrocytes. The CSF-induced necrosis is due to increase of cytosolic Ca 2 + which is mediated through capacitative Ca 2 + release by the ER involving the ATP-sensitive PY 2 -receptor...|$|E
