25|$|In most {{reptiles}} the perilymphatic duct and lagena {{are relatively}} short, and the sensory cells {{are confined to}} a small basilar papilla lying between them. However, in birds, mammals, and crocodilians, these structures become much larger and somewhat more complicated. In birds, crocodilians, and monotremes, the ducts are simply extended, together forming an elongated, more or less <b>straight,</b> <b>tube.</b> The endolymphatic duct is wrapped in a simple loop around the lagena, with the basilar membrane lying along one side. The {{first half of the}} duct is now referred to as the scala vestibuli, while the second half, which includes the basilar membrane, is called the scala tympani. As a result of this increase in length, the basilar membrane and papilla are both extended, with the latter developing into the organ of Corti, while the lagena is now called the cochlear duct. All of these structures together constitute the cochlea.|$|E

Malacostraca have haemocyanin as the oxygen-carrying pigment, while copepods, ostracods, {{barnacles}} and branchiopods have haemoglobins. The alimentary canal consists of a <b>straight</b> <b>tube</b> that often has a gizzard-like [...] "gastric mill" [...] for grinding food {{and a pair of}} digestive glands that absorb food; this structure goes in a spiral format.

The exhaust stack was replaced with a <b>straight</b> <b>tube</b> of metal and the cab walls and roof were removed. The PRR then exhibited the engine in 1883 at the National Railway Appliance Exhibition in Chicago, Illinois.

2500|$|The design {{popularized by}} von Liebig thus {{consisted}} of an inner, <b>straight</b> <b>tube</b> {{surrounded by an}} outer <b>straight</b> <b>tube,</b> with the outer tube having ports for fluid inflow and outflow, and with the two tubes sealed in some fashion at the ends (eventually, by a blown glass ring seal). Its simplicity made it convenient to construct and inexpensive to manufacture, the higher heat capacity of the circulating water (vs. air) allowed for maintaining near to constant temperature in the condenser, and so the Liebig type {{proved to be the}} more efficient condenser—capable of condensing liquid from a much greater flow of incoming vapor—and therefore replaced retorts and air condensers. An added benefit of the simplicity of the straight inner tube design of this condenser type is that it can be [...] "packed" [...] with materials that increase the surface area (and so the number of theoretical plates of the distillation column, see section below), e.g., plastic, ceramic, and metal beads, rings, wool, etc. [...] See Fractional Distillation.|$|E

2500|$|Early {{use of the}} {{water-tube}} boiler {{within the}} Royal Navy was controversial at times, giving rise to the [...] 'Battle of the Boilers' [...] around 1900. These first boilers, such as the Belleville and Niclausse, were large-tube designs, with simple <b>straight</b> <b>tubes</b> of around 4" [...] diameter, at a shallow angle to the horizontal. These tubes were jointed into cast iron headers and gave much trouble with leakage at these joints. At the time, an assumption was that thermal expansion in these <b>straight</b> <b>tubes</b> was straining the joints. These boilers were also large, and although fitted to many pre-dreadnought battleships, could not be fitted to the small torpedo boats and the early destroyers then under very active development.|$|R

2500|$|The {{dimensions}} and key {{system of the}} modern western concert flute and its close relatives are almost completely {{the work of the}} great flautist, composer, acoustician, and silversmith Theobald Boehm, who patented his system in 1847. It was immediately popular, and spread worldwide in just a few years. Minor additions to and variations on his key system are common, but the acoustical structure of the tube remains almost exactly as he designed it. Major innovations were the change to metal instead of wood, large <b>straight</b> <b>tube</b> bore, [...] "parabolic" [...] tapered headjoint bore, very large tone holes covered by keys, and the linked key system, which simplified fingering somewhat. The most substantial departures from Boehm's original description are the universal elimination of the [...] "crutch" [...] for the left hand and almost universal adoption of Briccialdi's thumb key mechanism and a closed-standing G key over an additional G tone hole. Boehm's key system, with minor variations, remains regarded as the most effective system of any modern woodwind, allowing trained instrumentalists to perform with facility and extraordinary velocity and brilliance in all keys.|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes called [...] "tube", [...] "pocket" [...] or [...] "ringless" [...] slings, {{these are}} {{generally}} formed {{by a wide}} piece of fabric sewn into a tubular shape. Simple, or fitted pouches do not have rings or other hardware. Adjustable pouches may adjust with zippers, snaps, buckles, clips, rings, drawstrings, velcro, and other methods. Most pouches have a curve sewn in to shape the cloth to the parent's body and hold the baby more securely than a simple <b>straight</b> <b>tube.</b> The wearer slips the pouch over the head and one shoulder, sash-style, creating a pocket or seat to hold the baby in. Many pediatricians and baby-wearing experts do not recommend pouch slings because babies can suffocate when held incorrectly. Suffocation risk is greatest in newborns and infants under six months, and usually occurs because the baby's chin is collapsed against his or her chest, constricting the airway. Pouch slings also often restrict the parent's view of their child, making suffocation more likely. When using a pouch sling, wearers should {{be sure to keep}} the baby's face elevated and clearly visible.|$|E
2500|$|Coelacanths {{are a part}} of the clade Sarcopterygii, or the lobe-finned fishes. Externally, several {{characteristics}} {{distinguish the}} coelacanth from other lobe-finned fish. They possess a three-lobed caudal fin, also called a trilobate fin or a diphycercal tail. A secondary tail extending past the primary tail separates the upper and lower halves of the coelacanth. Cosmoid scales act as thick armor to protect the coelacanth's exterior. Several internal traits also aid in differentiating coelacanths from other lobe-finned fish. At the back of the skull, the coelacanth possesses a hinge, the intracranial joint, which allows it to open its mouth extremely wide. Coelacanths also retain an oil-filled notochord, a hollow, pressurized tube which is replaced by the vertebral column early in embryonic development in most other vertebrates. The coelacanth heart is shaped differently from that of most modern fish, with its chambers arranged in a <b>straight</b> <b>tube.</b> The coelacanth braincase is 98.5% filled with fat; only 1.5% of the braincase contains brain tissue. The cheeks of the coelacanths are unique because the opercular bone is very small and holds a large soft-tissue opercular flap. A spiracular chamber is present, but the spiracle is closed and never opens during development. Coelacanth also possess a unique rostral organ within the ethmoid region of the braincase. Also unique to extant coelacanths is the presence of a [...] "fatty lung" [...] or a fat-filled single-lobed vestigial lung, homologous to other fishes' swim bladder. The parallel development of a fatty organ for buoyancy control suggest a unique specialization for deep-water habitats. There has also been discovered small, hard but flexible plates around the vestigial lung in adult specimen, though not around the fatty organ. The plates most likely had a regulation function for the volume of the lung. Due to the size of the fatty organ, it is assumed to be responsible for the kidney's unusual relocation. The two kidneys, which are fused into one, are located ventrally within the abdominal cavity, posterior to the cloaca.|$|E
40|$|Composites {{have proven}} their great {{potential}} for many aerospace applications, where high performance justifies high cost. One of the potential applications of composites is helicopter landing gears. Helicopter landing gears consist of <b>straight</b> and curved <b>tubes.</b> A new analysis and design tool is required to consider the manufacturing technology. In this study, high-order analytical methods are proposed to analyze and design thick laminated orthotropic <b>straight</b> and curved <b>tubes</b> subjected to different boundary and loading conditions. In {{the first part of}} this thesis, the elasticity displacement field of thick laminated composite <b>straight</b> <b>tubes</b> is developed. In this investigation, thick composite cantilever tubes under transverse loading are studied using the newly displacement-based method. This method provides a quick, convenient and accurate procedure for the determination of 3 D stresses in thick composite <b>straight</b> <b>tubes</b> subjected to both bending and shear loadings. In addition, this method is used to study stress and strain distributions in thick composite <b>straight</b> <b>tubes</b> with different simple and complex lay-up sequences. Note that thick laminated composite <b>straight</b> <b>tubes</b> subjected to cantilever loading conditions are investigated for the first time. Moreover, the developed method is used to analyze thick laminated composite <b>straight</b> <b>tubes</b> subjected to different mechanical loadings such as axial force, torque and bending moment. In the second part of this thesis, the general displacement field of thick laminated composite curved tubes is developed. By proposing a new high-order displacement-based method, single-layer composite curved tubes are examined. First, a displacement approach of Toroidal Elasticity is chosen to obtain the displacement field of single-layer composite curved tubes. Then, a layer-wise method is employed to develop the most general displacement field of elasticity for thick arbitrary laminated composite curved tubes. The developed method is used to analyze single-layer and laminated composite curved tubes subjected to pure bending moment. Note that displacement-based Toroidal Elasticity is applied to study thick laminated composite curved tubes for the first time. In addition, the failure analysis on thick composite curved tubes subjected to pure bending moment is conducted. Effects of lay-up sequences of composite curved tubes on stress distributions and failure sequences are investigated, as well. The accuracy of the proposed methods is verified by comparing the numerical results obtained using the proposed methods against finite element method, experimental data and solutions available in the literature. The methods that proposed in this thesis do not require meshing. They simplify greatly inputs that the user has to do, once the program for solution is available. This presents a clear advantage over FEM. Therefore, the most important advantage of the proposed methods is that inputs for modeling and analyzing of composite <b>straight</b> and curved <b>tubes</b> with complex lay-up sequences are simple, easy to use and fast to run. In addition, using FEM for the parametric study is cumbersome. By applying the proposed methods, the parametric study for thick laminated composite <b>straight</b> and curved <b>tubes</b> is simple with low computational cost...|$|R

Another species scoops a circular hollow in the soil, and builds over it a dome of fine woven grass. It should be mentioned that the nesting habits of only about fifteen out of the sixty-five species comprised in this genus are known to us. In the genus Furnarius the oven-shaped clay structure is known to be made by three species; a fourth builds a nest of sticks in a tree; a fifth burrows in the side of a bank, like a kingfisher.|$|E

The third form of {{apparatus}} contains both electrodes in {{the same}} tube; the transmission, therefore, of the electricity, and the consequent decomposition, is far more rapid than in the separate tubes.

6000|$|In {{all these}} Examples it is evident, {{that there is}} an {{extraordinary}} and adventitious force, by which the globular Figure of the contained heterogeneous fluid is altered; neither can it be imagined, how it should otherwise be of any other Figure then Globular: For being by the heterogeneous fluid equally protruded every way, whatsoever part is protuberant, will be thereby deprest. From this cause it is, that in its effects it does very much resemble a round Spring (such as a Hoop.) For as in a round Spring there is required an additional pressure against two opposite sides, to reduce it into an Oval Form, or to force it in between the sides of a Hole, whose Diameter is less then that of the Spring, there must be a considerable force or protusion against the concave or inner side of the Spring; So to alter this spherical constitution of an included fluid body, there is required more pressure against opposite sides to reduce it into an Oval; and, to press it into an Hole less in Diameter then it self, it requires a greater protrusion against all the other sides, What degrees of force are requisite to reduce them into longer and longer Ovals, or to press them into less and less holes, I have not yet experimentally calculated; but thus much by experiment I find in general, that there is alwayes required a greater pressure to close them into longer Ovals, or protude them into smaller holes.

6000|$|One {{morning in}} the month of October, the great breeding-time for birds in the Southern Hemisphere, while {{cautiously}} picking my way through a bed of eardoon bushes, the mysterious little creature flitted up and perched among the clustering leaves quite near to me. It uttered a feeble grasshopper-like chirp; and then a second individual, smaller, paler-coloured, and if possible shyer than the first, showed itself for two or three seconds, after which both birds dived once more into concealment. How glad I was to see them! for here they were, male and female, in a suitable spot in my own fields, where they evidently meant to breed. Every day after that I paid them one cautious visit, and by waiting from five to fifteen minutes, standing motionless among the thistles, I always succeeded in getting them to show themselves for a few moments. I could easily have secured them then, but my wish was to discover their nesting habits; and after watching for some days, I was rewarded by finding their nest; then for three days more I watched it slowly progressing towards completion, and each time I approached it one of the small birds would flit out to vanish into the herbage. The structure was about six inches long, and not more than two inches in diameter, and was placed horizontally on a broad stiff eardoon leaf, sheltered by other leaves above. It was made of the finest dry grass loosely woven, and formed a simple perfectly <b>straight</b> <b>tube,</b> open at both ends. The aperture was so small that I could only insert my little finger, and the bird could not, of course, have turned round in so narrow a passage, and so always went in at one end and left by the other. On visiting the spot on the fourth day I found, to my intense chagrin, that the delicate fabric had been broken and thrown down by some animal; also, that the birds had utterly vanished--for I sought them in vain, both there and in every weedy and thistly spot in the neighbourhood. The bird without the nest had seemed a useless thing to possess; now, for all my pains, I had only a wisp of fine dry grass in my hand, and no bird. The shy, modest little creature, dwelling violet-like amidst clustering leaves, and even when showing itself still [...] "half-hidden from the eye," [...] was thereafter to be only a tantalizing image in memory. Still, my case was not so hopeless as that of the imagined lapidary; for however rare a species may be, and near to its final extinction, there must always be many individuals existing, and I was cheered by the thought that I might yet meet with one at some future time. And, even if this particular species was not to gladden my sight again, there were others, scores and hundreds more, and at any moment I might expect to see one shining, a living gem, on Nature's open extended palm.|$|E
