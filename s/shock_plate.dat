40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{physical}} reasons {{of why the}} particle is more accelerated in the cold spray nozzle when helium gas {{is used as a}} process gas compared to nitrogen gas， by using one-dimensional calculation. In addition， the deceleration mechanism of the particle between a <b>plate</b> <b>shock</b> wave and a substrate is also investigated. The selected particle in the calculation is spherical Cu with the diameters of 5 and 15 μm. The calculated results reveal that 1) the particle injected into the helium gas flow has a larger velocity just upstream of the <b>plate</b> <b>shock</b> wave because a larger drag force keeps acting on the particle from the injection port to the <b>plate</b> <b>shock</b> wave. The larger drag force is due to a larger drag coefficient just downstream of the injection port, followed by a larger squared relative velocity of the particle in the downstream region， 2) the particle accelerated by the helium gas is less decelerated between the <b>plate</b> <b>shock</b> wave and the substrate because the squared relative velocity of the particle is decreased to less than 1 / 10 by passing through the <b>plate</b> <b>shock</b> wave for the helium gas case...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This study {{investigated}} the effects of acute global ischemia on the vulnerable window, the upper limit of vulnerability and the defibrillation threshold. Background. Myocardial ischemia, an important factor for arrhythmogenesis and sudden death, may affect the inducibility of ventricular fibrillation by T wave shocks {{as well as the}} defibrillation threshold. However, studies of the effect of ischemia on the defibrillation threshold remain inconclusive, and the effect of ischemia on recently established variables of ventricular fibrillation vulnerability is still unknown. Methods. Ten isolated, perfused rabbit hearts were immersed in a tissue bath between two <b>shock</b> <b>plate</b> electrodes. Truncated 5 -ms biphasic shocks were used to determine the vulnerable window, the upper limit of vulnerability and the defibrillation threshold. Measurements were performed during baseline and at 10 to 15 min of acute ischemia induced by an 80 % reduction of coronary flow. The effects of ischemia were monitored by measuring the dispersion of ventricular activation and repolarization using multiple monophasic action potential recordings. Results. Acute ischemia caused an increase in dispersion of activation (baseline vs. ischemia [mean ± SD]: 22 ± 6 vs. 34 ± 10 ms, p < 0. 001) and dispersion of repolarization (37 ± 16 vs. 69 ± 29 ms, p < 0. 01). The width of the vulnerable window increased from 25 ± 22 ms during baseline to 75 ± 26 ms during ischemia (p = 0. 001). The upper limit of vulnerability (baseline vs. ischemia: 294 ± 44 vs. 274 ± 53 V, p = 0. 21) and the defibrillation threshold (271 ± 33 vs. 268 ± 42 V, p = 0. 74) remained unchanged during ischemia. Conclusions. Acute global ischemia caused a threefold increase in the width of the vulnerable window. This increase was associated with increased heterogeneity of ventricular activation and repolarization. Despite these marked changes, the upper limit of vulnerability and the defibrillation threshold were not affected by acute myocardial ischemia. Thus, the previously reported similarity between both measures was maintained under these adverse conditions. (J Am Coll Cardiol 1997; 29 : 817 – 24...|$|E

The sweep tests was intended to investigate the change of bonding properties between emulsion asphalt and aggregate with curing time. The Vialit <b>Plate</b> <b>Shock</b> test was used to evaluate the bonding properties of chip seal materials at low temperatures. RESULTS:Results from sweep tests showed that polymer modified emulsion asphalt can reduce the curing time by 1. 5 hour comparing with typical emulsion asphalt.

Actually, femtosecond (fs) technologies allow to reach strong pressures over {{a very fast}} duration. This work is dedicated to characterize metals behavior in this ultra-short mode, (aluminum, tantalum), leading to an extreme dynamic solicitation in the target (> 107 s− 1). The study includes the validation of experimental results obtained on the LULI 100 TW facility by comparison with numerical model. Three modeling steps are considered. First, we characterize the pressure loading resulting from the fs laser-matter interaction, different from {{what happens in the}} classical nanosecond regime. Then, the shock wave propagation is observed through the target and particularly its pressure decay, strong in this regime. The elastic-plastic influence on the shock attenuation is discussed, particularly for tantalum which has a high elastic limit. Dynamic damage appears with spallation. Experimentally, spallation is characterized by VISAR measurements and post-test observations. Shots with different thicknesses have been carried out to determine the damage properties in function of strain rate. We show in this work that a simple instantaneous rupture criterion is not sufficient to reproduce the damage induced in the sample. Only the Kanel model, which includes damage kinetics, is able to reproduce experimental data (VISAR measurements, spall thickness). A generalization of this model to any strain rate can be performed by confronting these results to other shock generators data (ns laser driven <b>shocks,</b> <b>plate</b> impacts).

Data from steady nitrogen jets are compared to both pulsed jets and rocket exhaust plumes at Mach approx. 5. Due to engine cycling, overpressures and the <b>plate</b> <b>shock</b> dynamics are different between pulsed and steady supersonic impinging jets. In contrast to highly over-expanded (e 5 (lunar atmospheric regime), the ground pressure is minimal due {{to the development of}} a highly expansive shock structure.

Reference values of the lattice spacing {{for each of the}} reflections were found from the diffraction pattern collected from a stress-free sampling volume. The residual elastic strain values calculated on the basis of each reflection were then computed and plotted as a function of distance from the treated surface. Residual strain profiles show significant difference, reflecting the variation in the elastic and plastic with orientation of the grain, i. e. anisotropy. The average macroscopic residual elastic strain was therefore computed using an appropriate average, taking into account multiplicity of each reflection. Since the greatest contrast in elastic and plastic properties exists between directions (00. 2) and (11. 0), the difference between residual elastic strains measured for these reflections was plotted, together with the 'difference strain' between (00. 2) and (10. 1).

Clostridium difficile is a Gram positive, anaerobic, spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium that causes antibiotic-associated diarrhea in hospitalized and community-dwelling patients. Recent findings {{have suggested that}} this organism may be transmitted from animals to humans through the consumption of contaminated foods. Genotypic similarities have been found among C. difficile strains isolated from animals and humans. However, comparisons {{of the behavior of}} these two groups of strains at the physiological level have not been conducted in detail. This study sought to determine the prevalence of C. difficile in retail meats from Minnesota and to compare human and animal isolates by measuring the growth rate and their survival in meats during cold storage. Meat samples were obtained from retail stores from Minnesota and consisted mainly of raw beef, pork, and poultry. These samples were analyzed for the presence of C. difficile by initial enrichment in Clostridium difficile moxalactam-norfloxacin (CDMN) broth, followed by ethanol <b>shock,</b> <b>plating</b> onto CDMN agar, and anaerobic incubation for 48 h at 37 °C. Suspicious colonies were subjected to confirmation by colony morphology, Gram staining, and production of L-proline aminopeptidase. Growth rate parameters were determined for a total of 35 C. difficile strains isolated from humans and animals. Optical density was measured during exponential growth on brain hearth infusion broth at 37 °C anoxically. The average growth rates of the two groups were then compared. A subgroup of 5 human and 5 animal strains was selected to assess the survival of C. difficile in meats during cold storage. C. difficile strains were inoculated onto ground meats to a level of approximately 105 CFU/g. Inoculated meats were stored at 4 °C and - 15 °C for 5 and 20 days, respectively. C. difficile counts were determined at different times during storage by plating onto CDMN agar. A total of 342 raw meat and poultry samples were collected from 5 different counties in central Minnesota from 25 retail stores. Twenty nine samples had CDMN-presumptive colonies, but none of them were confirmed as C. difficile C. I. 0 - 0. 013 % of meats positive for C. difficile at a 95 % level. The average growth rate of 22 human strains at 37 °C was 0. 52 ± 0. 25 h- 1, which was not significantly different from the value for 13 animal strains (0. 62 ± 0. 15 h- 1) (p> 0. 05). Counts of C. difficile strains inoculated on ground beef and chicken diminished during storage at 4 °C and - 15 °C. Overall reduction in bacterial counts was not significantly different between human and animal strains. These findings suggested that C. difficile was not commonly present in retail meats from Minnesota.

Joule-Thomson coefficient of CO 2 is proven to be higher than the coefficient of other gases’ such as nitrogen, hydrogen, air. This temperature drop causes the formation of small CO 2 dry-ice particles. In addition to the enhanced cooling performance caused by lowered bulk-jet temperature, heat transfer is improved by the additional sublimation effect between the dry-ice particles and the cooling target surface. A comparison of the cooling performance between the suggested CO 2 solid-gas two-phase jet and a single-phase nitrogen (N 2) jet was performed experimentally as well. In order to form dry-ice particles, high pressure and velocity of jet fluid are inevitably required, which is enough for compressible effect to appear. Both jets have differences not only in phase change but also in jet flow structures. As jet velocity increased, shock structures at jet downstream appeared and surface temperature is changed as well. The structures are detected more clearly in N 2 jet than CO 2 jet because of the difference in total pressure at jet boundary, therefore, relationship between shock structure of N 2 jet flow and heat transfer is investigated in this study. In case of high Reynolds number impinging jet which is enough to reach supersonic flow regime, stagnation temperature of impinged surface is affected by jet structure as well as other factors such as nozzle-plate distance or radial distance does. When the jet flow velocity becomes supersonic, shock structures are constructed at downstream of the nozzle exit. Complicated shock structure such as Mach <b>shock</b> disk, <b>plate</b> <b>shock</b> is highly expected to affect to the heat transfer behavior of impingement surface. In this study, a cooling performance of supersonic N 2 jet is investigated by measuring the impinged surface temperature and the flow of the jet is visualized by Schlieren image system. Visualized image and surface temperature are compared to clarify the flow structure-related heat transfer characteristics. In all the experiments of present study, jet fluids are expanded through a circular nozzle and impinged on an electrically heated flat heater surface, and their heat transfer coefficients are measured. The performances of the impinging jet for both fluids are also evaluated via the variance of flow parameters, for example, the Reynolds number, and the jet geometry configurations. clos...|$|R
