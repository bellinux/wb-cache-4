50|$|Tokajský výber (in Hungarian: aszú): This is {{the wine}} which made Tokaj world famous. It is a sweet dessert wine made by {{individually}} picking botrytised grapes and trampling them in huge vats {{to form a}} paste. Must is then poured on the paste and left to soak before the wine is transferred to wooden casks where fermentation in completed. The wines are graded from 3 to 6 putňa (puttony), representing the level of sugar and <b>sugar-free</b> <b>extract</b> in the mature wine.|$|E
50|$|The {{concentration}} of aszú was traditionally {{defined by the}} number of puttony of dough added to a Gönc cask (136 liter barrel) of must. Nowadays the puttony number is based on the content of sugar and <b>sugar-free</b> <b>extract</b> in the mature wine. Aszú ranges from 3 puttonyos to 6 puttonyos, with a further category called Aszú-Eszencia representing wines above 6 puttonyos. Unlike most other wines, alcohol content of aszú typically runs higher than 14%. Annual production of aszú is {{less than one percent of}} the region's total output.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, common {{parameters}} of wine are measured using attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (ATR-FTIR). ATR cell is used {{which have the}} advantage of easy filling and cleaning. The parameters include sugar, alcohol, acid, 2 SO, <b>sugar-free</b> <b>extract,</b> which is routinely measured in the wine quality determination. Commercial wines (n= 125) both red and white were analyzed using the ATR-FTIR spectrometer. Reference data were measured based on standard procedure (GB 15038 — 2006) and performed by technical analyst. Using PLS calibration method samples ’ concentration can be predicted. The accuracy of quantification of main component such as total acidity, sugar, alcohol was excellent, with the measure error low than 1 g/L. Some subdivision components are well, that concentration can be predicted in a lower accuracy. Based on the accuracy we obtained, the presented method can be used in winery widely as a fast method for measuring wine’s content...|$|E
40|$|Phenolic {{compounds}} were {{extracted from}} the fruits of Morus nigra and Morus alba using methanol and acetone. The <b>sugar-free</b> <b>extracts</b> (SFEs) were prepared using Amberlite XAD- 16 column chromatography. All of the SFEs exhibited antioxidant potential as determined by ABTS (0. 75 – 1. 25 mmol Trolox/g), DPPH (2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl) (EC 50 from 48 μg/mL to 79 μg/mL), and reducing power assays. However, a stronger activity was noted for the SFEs obtained from Morus nigra fruits. These extracts also possessed the highest contents of total phenolics: 164 mg/g (methanolic SFE) and 173 mg/g (acetonic SFE). The presence of phenolic acids and flavonoids in the extracts was confirmed using HPLC method and chlorogenic acid and rutin were found as the dominant phenolic constituents in the SFEs...|$|R

40|$|The {{dietary fibre}} in the prunes was {{prepared}} using the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) method for the soluble and insoluble dietary fibres. Prunes are very rich in dietary fibre (6 - 7 % {{of the fresh}} fruit) with approximatively 57 % of soluble dietary fibre and 43 % of insoluble dietary fibre. The soluble dietary fibre is rich in pectins whereas the insoluble dietary fibre contains mainly cellulose, with significant amounts of pectins and hemicelluloses. 1 ­ ABBREVIATIONS AIS: alcohol insoluble solids DF: dietary fibre SDF: soluble dietary fibre IDF: insoluble dietary fibre TDF: total dietary fibre 2 ­ INTRODUCTION Many western countries have recommended increased consumption of foods rich in dietary fibre because of their potential health benefit such as protection against cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, colon cancer, as well as regulation of the transit time (Dreher, 2001; Gibney, 2001). Prunes are recognized as a healthy food (Stacewitz et al., 2001; Tinker et al., 1991). They are dried plums, the fruits of Prunus domestica cv d'Ente. After harvest, the fruits are dried for 16 - 24 h at 75 °C to reduce the moisture content down to 21 - 23 %; the prunes are then stored and rehydrated to 33 - 35 % before marketing (Somogyi, 1987). They may be consumed directly in the diet or more rarely after processing to juices or purees for exemple (Stacewitz et al., 2001; Tinker et al., 1991). Prunes have long been used to treat intestinal disorders such as constipation. They are known to contain dietary fibre, sugars, sugar alcohols (sorbitol) and other substances having effects the intestinal function as laxatives (Somogyi, 1987; Stacewitz et al., 2001; Tinker et al., 1991). Prunes are also {{a good source of}} energy, phenolic acids, minerals or vitamins (Dikeman et al., 2004; Donavan et al., 1998; Kayano et al., 2003; Piga et al., 2003; Somogyi, 1987; Stacewitz et al., 2001; Tinker et al., 1991). The literature is very scarce on the constitutive dietary fibres and their polysaccharides. A value of ~ 11 g/ 100 g dry matter was found for total dietary fibre (Piga et al., 2003); this value is in the range (6 - 16 g/ 100 g fresh matter) given by Stacewitz et al. (2001). Some food table compositions (Englyst et al., 1988; Fang et al., 2002) gave values of 8 - 9 g/ 100 g dry matter for total dietary fibre with 55 - 67 % of soluble dietary fibre. This paper deals with the determination of dietary fibres in various prune samples and the analysis of their constitutive polysaccharides. We have measured in this work the dietary fibre by the conventional enzymatic-gravimetric method and characterised the solubleand insoluble-dietray fibre by their sugar composition. Dietary fibre in prunes 425 3 ­ MATERIALS AND METHODS 3. 1 Plant material The prunes were sampled in region of Villeneuve-sur-Lot (F). The 11 samples used in this study varied by their storage conditions, their moisture contents and their sizes; some were stoned. 3. 2 Preparation of alcohol insoluble solids (AIS) The prunes were first stoned and cut into small pieces (d ~ 5 mm). The samples were grinded in boiling ethanol 80 % (12 mL ethanol/g of sample) : after boiling for 20 min, the samples were filtered on a Büchner (G 3) funnel. The insoluble material was washed with ethanol 80 % until a <b>sugar-free</b> <b>extract</b> was obtained (phenol-sulfuric acid test). The residue (AIS) was washed successively with ethanol 96 %, and acetone, then air-dried overnight at 40 °C and weighed. 3. 3 Determination of dietary fibre (DF) The dietary fibre was measured gravimetrically after removing the non fibre constituents by enzymatic means as described by Prosky et al. (1988). Duplicates (2 x 1 g) in a 0. 08 M phosphate buffer pH 6. 0 were analysed for soluble (SDF) and insoluble (IDF) dietary fibres. Samples were treated with a thermostable -amylase from Aspergillus niger (Termamyl 120 L, Novozymes, Denmark) and then digested with a protease from Bacillus licheniformis (P 5380, Sigma Aldrich, France) and an amyloglucosidase from Aspergillus niger (A- 3042, Sigma). SDF and IDF were separated by filtration on a G 4 funnel. SDF was recovered from the filtrate by precipitation with 4 volumes of ethanol 96 %, then dried by solvent exchange and under vacuum overnight at 40 °C. IDF was dried by solvent exchange and under vacuum overnight at 40 °C. A blank was performed by the same procedure. IDF and SDF values were obtained after corrections from the blank, and residual ash and proteins. Total dietary fibre (TDF) was calculated as the sum of IDF and SDF. Preliminary assays (data not shown) evidenced that very similar values of DF were obtained directly from the prunes and from AIS. Therefore, for easiness reasons, the starting material for the determination of DF was the AIS and not the entire fruit 3. 4 Determination of the uronic acids SDF were first deesterified with 0. 05 M NaOH for 30 min and neutralised La with 0. 1 M HCl, whereas the AIS and IDF (~ 25 mg), after grinding in liquid nitrogen, were prehydrolysed with 13 M H 2 SO 4 for 1 h at 25 °C (Saeman et al., 1954). The uronic acids (as galacturonic acid) were determined by the automatic metahydroxybiphenyl methodLes teneurs en fibres alimentaires des pruneaux ont été mesurées par la méthode de l'AOAC (Association of Official Analytical Chemists) qui permet de quantifier les fibres solubles, les fibres insolubles et les fibres totales (somme des solubles et des insolubles). Les pruneaux sont riches en fibres puisque leur teneur est de 6 - 7 % par rapport à la matière fraîche; les fibres solubles représentent environ 57 % et les insolubles 43 %. Les fibres solubles sont particulièrement riches en substances pectiques alors que les fibres insolubles contiennent principalement de la cellulose avec des quantités significatives de pectines et d'hémicelluloses...|$|E

P. alba flour showed significantly higher total (sum of Free- and Bound) phenolic content and total flavonoid compounds than P. nigra (p < 0. 05) while P. nigra had higher concentrations of anthocyanins than P. alba (p < 0. 05). The P. nigra flour shows a pattern characterized by the occurrence of anthocyanins as well as 14 flavonoid glycosides, with higher chemical diversity than P. alba, which shows 8 flavonoid glycosides as relevant constituents. The main compounds were quercetin 0 -glycosides and apigenin-based C-glycosides. The phenolic composition of two South American algarrobo pod flour is presented for the first time. P. nigra pods having higher content of anthocyanins are darker (purple) than those of P. alba (light brown). Furthermore, the <b>sugar-free</b> polyphenolic <b>extracts</b> of P. nigra and P. alba as well as anthocyanins enriched extracts from P. nigra showed antioxidant activity. P. nigra and P. alba polyphenolic extracts showed activity against a pro-inflammatory enzyme. In conclusion, algarrobo pods meal contained biologically active polyphenols, with a positive impact on human health. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
