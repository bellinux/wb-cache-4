5|$|Jaguar, Léopard and Panthère were {{assigned}} to the Northern Command (Forces maritimes du Nord) on 7 <b>September</b> <b>in</b> anticipation of a German invasion of Belgium.

5|$|Again the defences were {{strengthened}} in <b>September,</b> <b>in</b> {{advance of}} a second siege which began on 16 October. By this stage only ten per cent of Edinburgh's inhabitants remained in the city. The besiegers under Regent Mar had only seven guns, and while they did manage to breach the Flodden Wall, the inner defences were too strong for an assault. By 21 October the siege was once again lifted. A blockade of the town was continued until July 1572 when a truce was agreed. Grange retreated into the castle and handed over the town to the Regent's party. The siege of Edinburgh Castle continued until May 1573, when it was finally reduced by a battery of guns shipped from England.|$|E

5|$|Archbishop Philip of Esztergom crowned Ladislaus king in Székesfehérvár {{on about}} 3 <b>September.</b> <b>In</b> theory, the 10-year-old Ladislaus ruled under his mother's regency, but in fact, baronial parties {{administered}} the kingdom. In November of that year, Henry Kőszegi returned from Bohemia and assassinated Ladislaus's cousin, Béla of Macsó. Duke Béla's extensive domains, which were located {{along the southern}} borders, were divided among Henry Kőszegi and his supporters. In retaliation for Hungarian incursions into Austria and Moravia, Austrian and Moravian troops invaded the borderlands of Hungary in April 1273.
