500|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>feeding</b> {{itself can}} be broken up into two {{different}} approaches, <b>surface</b> <b>feeding</b> while flying (for example as practiced by gadfly petrels, frigatebirds and storm petrels), and <b>surface</b> <b>feeding</b> while swimming (examples of which are practiced by fulmars, gulls, many of the shearwaters and gadfly petrels). Surface feeders in flight include {{some of the most}} acrobatic of seabirds, which either snatch morsels from the water (as do frigate-birds and some terns), or [...] "walk", pattering and hovering on the water's surface, as some of the storm-petrels do. Many of these do not ever land in the water, and some, such as the frigatebirds, have difficulty getting airborne again should they do so. Another seabird family that does not land while feeding is the skimmer, which has a unique fishing method: flying along the surface with the lower mandible in the water—this shuts automatically when the bill touches something in the water. The skimmer's bill reflects its unusual lifestyle, with the lower mandible uniquely being longer than the upper one.|$|R

40|$|Wildlife feeding is {{very popular}} and {{widespread}} throughout the Western world. In Australia, the public is actively engaged in {{both private and public}} settings. <b>Duck</b> <b>feeding</b> in urban lakes, in particular, is a popular public activity. This preliminary study investigated the practice of <b>duck</b> <b>feeding</b> at 10 locations within south-east Queensland. The diversity of waterbird species fed was consistent with previous studies within the region. An unexpected finding was the abundance of domesticated ducks present. Dabbling duck species were seen to take advantage of <b>feeding</b> whereas grazing <b>duck</b> species did not. It was found that <b>duck</b> <b>feeding</b> was a common practice of humans and that on average people were involved for 4. 5 minutes and fed an average of 4. 9 slices of bread per feeding session. This suggests a need for further study into the potential impacts of bread deposited into the water system and the general health of duck species.
