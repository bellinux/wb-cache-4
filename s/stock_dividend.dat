Recent literature has examined the accounting for <b>stock</b> <b>dividends</b> versus <b>stock</b> splits and found that generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in this area is in need of reform. ^ This paper is an examination of accounting for small <b>stock</b> <b>dividends</b> (those less than 20 to 25 percent). GAAP guidelines indicate that small <b>stock</b> <b>dividends</b> be recorded at fair market value. Accounting textbooks suggest that fair market value is determined on the declaration date. Further, efficient market research indicates that there is no abnormal gain to be made with the information inherent in <b>stock</b> <b>dividends.</b> Thus, there should be {{no significant difference between the}} market price on the declaration date and the amount per share used to reduce retained earnings. This was the null hypothesis. Also tested were the ex-date, the date of record, and the date payable. ^ Results of the tests of the null hypotheses that there is no significant difference between the market price per share on the date tested and the amount per share used to reduce retained earnings were to reject the null hypotheses. Other items were tested for their effect. These were different years, different sizes of small dividends, and different auditors of firms issuing small <b>stock</b> <b>dividends.</b> Further, tests of consistency were made on firms issuing <b>stock</b> <b>dividends</b> in each of two years. None of these additional tests influenced the results of the major hypothesis. ^ In conclusion, the results indicate that in practice, firms issuing small <b>stock</b> <b>dividends</b> are not using the declaration date, ex-date, date of record, or the date payable to determine fair market value. This is in violation of the comparability principle set forth in the Conceptual Framework. ^ Recommendations were made to revise the standards for accounting for small <b>stock</b> <b>dividends</b> and require capitalization of retained earnings of par value of the shares issued. ...|$|R

In Chapter two, we examine the announcement effects of dividends in the Chinese capital market, with an emphasis on <b>stock</b> <b>dividends.</b> We begin by separately investigating the cumulative abnormal returns around the announcements of cash, <b>stock</b> and combined <b>dividends.</b> Because earnings are announced concurrently with dividend decisions in China, and therefore the estimated abnormal returns could be confounded by the earnings effect, we attempt to examine the dividend announcement effect under different earnings signals. We find a strong announcement effect of <b>stock</b> <b>dividends</b> even after controlling for concurrent earnings surprises. In contrast, pure cash <b>dividend</b> <b>stocks</b> experience no significant price run-up around the announcements. In addition, we examine the difference in market reactions to a positive or negative earnings announcement as firms initiate, maintain or switch to different forms of payouts.
