50|$|To improve aerodynamics, the bed {{is covered}} by a vinyl <b>snap</b> <b>on</b> <b>cover</b> {{supported}} by aluminum bows. Snap receivers slide within aluminum channels. A rear bow allows the tailgate to be opened without removing the cover. The cover can be quite difficult to re-snap under cold conditions due to shrinkage and stiffness of the vinyl material. As the bed was a carryover from the standard Ford Ranger body, some owners opted for after-market tonneau covers, such as hard fiberglass or roll-top.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This chapter reviews recent {{theory and}} {{empirical}} evidence regarding {{the effect of}} <b>SNAP</b> <b>on</b> food insecurity and replicates the modelling strategies used in the empirical literature. The authors find that recent evidence suggesting an ameliorative effect of <b>SNAP</b> <b>on</b> food insecurity may not be robust to specification choice or data. Most specifications mirror the existing literature in finding a positive association of food insecurity with SNAP participation. Two-stage least squares and control function methods do show that SNAP reduces food insecurity, but effects are not consistent across sub-populations and are not always statisticall...|$|R
