5|$|Although not all Conservapedia {{contributors}} <b>subscribe</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> young-earth creationist {{point of}} view—former administrator Terry Koeckritz stated to the Los Angeles Times {{that he did}} not take the Genesis creation account literally—sources have attributed the poor science coverage to an overall editorial support of the young-earth creationist perspective and an over-reliance on Christian creationist home-schooling textbooks. In an analysis in early 2007, science writer Carl Zimmer found evidence that much of what appeared to be inaccurate or inadequate information about science and scientific theory could be traced back to an over-reliance on citations from the works of home-schooling textbook author Jay L. Wile.|$|E

25|$|Taxicab {{companies}} may be independently owned small businesses {{with only one}} taxicab and driver or have fleets of 100 or more taxicabs. Drivers are rarely employees of the company, and usually lease the taxicab on a per-shift basis. Cabs can also be owned by separately-incorporated small businesses that <b>subscribe</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> dispatch service. The owner/driver will pay a monthly fee to the taxicab company; purchase and maintain his own vehicle, and may in turn lease shifts to other drivers.|$|E
25|$|In Vajrayāna particularly, Tibetan Buddhists <b>subscribe</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{voluntary}} code of self-censorship, {{whereby the}} uninitiated {{do not seek}} and are not provided with information about it. This self-censorship may be applied more or less strictly depending on circumstances such as the material involved. A depiction of a mandala may be less public {{than that of a}} deity. That of a higher tantric deity may be less public than that of a lower. The degree to which information on Vajrayāna is now public in western languages is controversial among Tibetan Buddhists.|$|E
25|$|Baptists <b>subscribe</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{doctrine}} that baptism {{should be performed}} only for professing believers (believer's baptism, as opposed to infant baptism), and {{that it must be}} done by complete immersion (as opposed to affusion or sprinkling). Other tenets of Baptist churches include soul competency (liberty), salvation through faith alone, Scripture alone as the rule of faith and practice, and the autonomy of the local congregation. Baptists recognize two ministerial offices, pastors and deacons. Baptist churches are widely considered to be Protestant churches, though some Baptists disavow this identity.|$|E

25|$|Marketeers {{primarily}} classify manga {{by the age}} {{and gender}} of the target readership. In particular, books and magazines sold to boys (shōnen) and girls (shōjo) have distinctive cover-art, and most bookstores place them on different shelves. Due to cross-readership, consumer response is not limited by demographics. For example, male readers may <b>subscribe</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> series intended for female readers, and so on. Japan has manga cafés, or manga kissa (kissa is an abbreviation of kissaten). At a manga kissa, people drink coffee, read manga and sometimes stay overnight.|$|E
25|$|Christians believe Jesus' {{death and}} resurrection makes it {{possible}} for believers to attain forgiveness for sin and reconciliation with God through the atonement. Reformed Protestants generally <b>subscribe</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> particular view of the atonement called substitutionary atonement, which explains Christ's death as a sacrificial payment for sin. Christ is believed to have died in place of the believer, who is accounted righteous {{as a result of this}} sacrificial payment. Contemporary Reformed theologians such as William Placher and Nancy Duff have criticized this view, claiming it makes God appear abusive or vindictive and sanctions violence by the strong against the weak.|$|E
25|$|In June 1982 the NEC {{discussed}} Militant again, with Heffer {{proposing that}} {{all members of}} the Labour Party <b>subscribe</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 'statement of democratic socialist principles' which was defeated by 22 votes to 5. At the 1982 Labour Party conference the right-wing won back control of the NEC, and at its first meeting the left-wing were voted out of all their chairmanships in a coup organised by John Golding. This included Heffer, who had been chairman of the powerful 'Organisation Sub-Committee' (usually known as Org Sub). The change allowed the right to begin to take action against Militant, membership of which was declared incompatible with party membership. The five members of Militant's editorial board were expelled in February 1983 despite Heffer's motion to have a further investigation.|$|E

25|$|Some taxicab {{companies}} are independently owned small businesses {{with only one}} taxicab and driver, but many cab companies have fleets of 100 or more taxicabs. Drivers are rarely employees of the company, and usually lease the taxicab on a per-shift basis. Lease drivers receive no benefits from the taxicab company, and often have to bribe dispatchers to get a shift. However, in some cases, cabs can also be owned by separately-incorporated small businesses that <b>subscribe</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> dispatch service, {{in which case the}} company logo on the door is that of the dispatch association. The owner/driver will pay a monthly fee to the taxicab company; purchase and maintain his own vehicle; and may in turn lease shifts to other drivers.|$|E
25|$|According to the OECD, {{income is}} {{a key factor in}} PC and Internet access. Access rates between the lowest and highest {{brackets}} range from country to country within the OECD –from 3 times more likely to 10 times more likely. The latest CNNIC survey indicates that 65 percent of China's Internet users earn an annual income of more than 6000 yuan; in contrast, the users who earn less than 6000 Yuan annually only share 15 percent of total Internet use. Although the non-income users do share 20 percent of Internet use, this fact may not undermine the importance of income because this 20 percent is more likely to represent students who usually receive a high living subsidy from their parents. Study of telephone subscription of farm households in rural China also proves that farm households with higher annual incomes are more likely to <b>subscribe</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> telephone than are low-income-level farm households.|$|E
25|$|The major {{sticking}} point {{for many in}} the question of human evolution was whether human mental faculties could have possibly been evolved. The gap between humans and even the smartest ape seemed too large, even for those who were sympathetic to Darwin's basic theory. Alfred Russel Wallace, the co-discoverer of evolution by natural selection, believed that the human mind was too complex to have evolved gradually, and began over time to <b>subscribe</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> theory of evolution that took more from spiritualism than it did the natural world. Darwin was deeply distressed by Wallace's change of heart, and much of the Descent of Man is in response to opinions put forth by Wallace. Darwin focuses less {{on the question of whether}} humans evolved than he does on showing that each of the human faculties considered to be so far beyond those of beasts—such as moral reasoning, sympathy for others, beauty, and music—can be seen in kind (if not degree) in other animal species (usually apes and dogs).|$|E
