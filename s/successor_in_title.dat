50|$|In some countries, {{such as the}} United States, Canada, Australia and Japan, a {{grace period}} exists for {{protecting}} an inventor or their <b>successor</b> <b>in</b> <b>title</b> from authorised or unauthorised disclosure of the invention before the filing date. That is, if the inventor or the <b>successor</b> <b>in</b> <b>title</b> publishes the invention, an application can still be validly filed which will be considered novel despite the publication, provided that the filing is made during the grace period following the publication. The grace period is usually 6 or 12 months.|$|E

50|$|The rule in Halsall v Brizell {{is limited}} to cases where the benefit {{can be linked to}} a {{specific}} burden and where the covenantor's <b>successors</b> <b>in</b> <b>title</b> can physically elect to take the benefit. For example, a restrictive covenant to contribute to the maintenance costs of a common area will not be binding if the covenantor's <b>successors</b> <b>in</b> <b>title</b> have no legal right to use them.|$|R

50|$|Lord Templeman {{held the}} tenancy was too {{uncertain}} to be effective, and thus had not created a binding lease.

5000|$|If a thing, {{with regard}} to which a claim in rem exists, comes by {{succession}} into the possession of a third party, the time of prescription which elapsed {{during the time of}} possession by the predecessor in title is reckoned in favor of the <b>successor</b> <b>in</b> <b>title</b> ...|$|E

50|$|This {{position}} is accepted by {{proponents of the}} universal-or-particular-successors distinction, {{as it has been}} agreed that the doctrine applies not only to purchasers of leased property, but also to gratuitous <b>successors</b> <b>in</b> <b>title</b> of the original lessor.|$|R
50|$|A {{covenant}} {{made with}} the owner of land is {{for the benefit of}} the land. It followed that the covenant can be enforced against the covenantor whether or no he owned any estate in the land, and also against <b>successors</b> <b>in</b> <b>title.</b>|$|R

40|$|Implied {{easements}} {{were initially}} created and then developed in eras when a Torrens or title-by-registration system did not operate. Like all traditional easements, implied easements were legal proprietary interests {{in favour of}} the dominant land which bound the <b>successors</b> <b>in</b> <b>title</b> of the servient land. Implied easements worked particularly well to accommodate the presumed intentions of parties, fill contractual gaps and provide a means of access to landlocked land. However, they operated and still operate outside title-by-registration...|$|R

50|$|Experience Hendrix LLC was the <b>successor</b> <b>in</b> <b>title</b> to Jimi Hendrix’s estate. PPX Enterprises {{were his}} music {{publishers}} and were suing {{him before he}} died. Three years after, they settled (1973). The agreement was that PPX were entitled to masters {{of some of his}} recordings, in Sch A of the agreement, provided PPX paid royalties to Experience Hendrix. In breach of the agreement, PPX granted licences to masters not in Sch A. Experience Hendrix sued for the breach.|$|E
50|$|In July 1999 {{the provincial}} synod of the Church of the Province of Southern Africa was petitioned by Bishop Sigqibo Dwane, the first {{bishop of the}} order, to rescind its Canon 48, which dealt with the {{relations}} between the CPSA and the Order of Ethiopia. The order then decided, on 27 August 1999, to change its name to the Ethiopian Episcopal Church, and declared that the Ethiopian Episcopal Church was the <b>successor</b> <b>in</b> <b>title</b> to the Ibandla laseTiyopia / Order of Ethiopia.|$|E

In the feudal aid of 1285 he is {{recorded}} as holding one knight's fee in Pancrasweek, half a fee at Southwick in Germansweek and half in Manaton (14 {{miles north of}} Berry Pomeroy Castle). In 1285 however Robert le Deneys was holding these manors not from the de Pomeroy barons but from the heirs of Patrick de Chaworth, who was <b>successor</b> <b>in</b> <b>title</b> to Brewer, lord of the manor of Buckland Brewer amongst others, who had himself purchased them from de Pomeroy.|$|E
50|$|At common law, {{the burden}} of a {{restrictive}} covenant does not run except where strict privity of estate (a landlord/tenant relationship) exists. The burden can be enforced at law in limited circumstances under the benefit/burden test - that is, whoever takes the benefit must also shoulder the burden. In Halsall v Brizell 1957 Ch 169, a covenant requiring the upkeep of roads was found to bind the <b>successor</b> <b>in</b> <b>title</b> to the original covenantor because he had elected to take the benefit. A positive burden can run in law, but not in equity.|$|E
50|$|In patent, {{industrial}} design rights and trademark laws, a priority right or {{right of priority}} is a time-limited right, triggered by the first filing of an application for a patent, an {{industrial design}} or a trademark respectively. The priority right allows the claimant to file a subsequent application in another country for the same invention, design, or trademark effective as of the date of filing the first application. When filing the subsequent application, the applicant must claim the priority of the first application {{in order to make}} use of the right of priority. The right of priority belongs to the applicant or his <b>successor</b> <b>in</b> <b>title.</b>|$|E
50|$|After the State of New York granted certain parcels {{within the}} Connecticut Gore to other individuals, the <b>successors</b> <b>in</b> <b>title</b> to Halsey and Ward filed an action for {{ejectment}} in the United States Circuit Court for the District of Connecticut. The defendants {{argued that they}} were residents of New York and that the land was actually in Steuben County, New York; only state or federal courts in New York could accordingly exercise jurisdiction over the action. The plaintiffs claimed that the lands were instead in Connecticut.|$|R
50|$|The Court of Appeal all {{held that}} the Board was in breach of contract, and that breach caused damage to the farm. The {{agreement}} showed the intention that the obligation would attach to the land, {{and it would not}} matter whose hands the land came into: the owner could enforce the covenant. Because the covenant ran with the land, under section 78 Law of Property Act 1925 it could be enforced by the covenantee and <b>successors</b> <b>in</b> <b>title.</b> Denning LJ's notable decision went as follows.|$|R
5000|$|In 2011, {{members of}} the Saeima from the National Alliance filed a {{question}} {{to the prime minister}} asking how the resolutive part of the declaration - [...] "the Latvian government is obliged to do the following: 1) demand the occupying countries and their <b>successors</b> <b>in</b> <b>title</b> to observe international law and pay Latvian citizens, their family members and heirs compensation for losses incurred as a result of illegal impressment into the armies of the occupying countries; 2) prevent insults against the honour and dignity of Latvian soldiers in Latvia and abroad."

5000|$|The [...] "Convention {{priority}} right", {{also called}} [...] "Paris Convention priority right" [...] or [...] "Union priority right", was also established by Article 4 of the Paris Convention, and {{is regarded as}} one of the cornerstones of the Paris Convention. It provides that an applicant from one contracting State shall be able to use its first filing date (in one of the contracting State) as the effective filing date in another contracting State, provided that the applicant, or his <b>successor</b> <b>in</b> <b>title,</b> files a subsequent application within 6 months (for industrial designs and trademarks) or 12 months (for patents and utility models) from the first filing.|$|E
5000|$|... "If {{it appears}} to the {{comptroller}} that a patent under this Act and a European patent (UK) have been granted for the same invention having the same priority date, and that the applications for the patents were filed by the same applicant or his <b>successor</b> <b>in</b> <b>title,</b> he shall give the proprietor of the patent under this Act an opportunity of making observations and of amending the specification of the patent, and if the proprietor fails to satisfy the comptroller {{that there are not}} two patents in respect of the same invention, or to amend the specification so as to prevent there being two patents in respect of the same invention, the comptroller shall revoke the patent." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{conditions}} of novelty and inventive step must be fulfilled {{by a certain}} date, generally the date on which the application is filed. An exception to this rule, covered by an applicant’s right of priority, is regulated by the Paris Convention. The right of priority means that, having filed an application in one member country of the Paris Convention, the same applicant (or their <b>successor</b> <b>in</b> <b>title)</b> may, within a specified time period, apply for protection for the same invention {{in any of the}} other member countries. These subsequent applications will not be invalidated by reason of any acts occurred between the filing date of the earliest application and the subsequent applications.|$|E
5000|$|The Province of Alberta owns 81 {{percent of}} mineral rights, {{including}} oil sands. Mineral rights {{owned by the}} Crown are managed by the Alberta Department of Energy {{on behalf of the}} citizens of the province.

These rights are referred to as [...] "freehold rights".|$|R
40|$|Worldwide {{copyright}} assignments {{that contain}} {{a choice of}} law clause are the norm. National copyright laws in the United Kingdom and Spain do, however, contain provisions on reversionary copyright in their transition provision. These provisions would, if applicable, terminate the assignment 25 years {{after the death of}} the author and hand the copyright back to the author's <b>successors</b> <b>in</b> <b>title</b> rather than the assignees. From a choice of law pwerspective this becomes a classification issue. This article argues that we are dealing with a transferability issue and that the issue cannot be classified as contractual.
