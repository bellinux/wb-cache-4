50|$|While some <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> {{filmed in}} Niagara Falls, Ontario, {{most of the}} film was filmed in and around Winnipeg, Manitoba. The motel <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> filmed in Steinbach. Additional <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> filmed in Lockport and Selkirk, where the real Riverside Grill stood until 2012.|$|R
5|$|The cockfight <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> cut by British censors.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea behind}} the shock therapy <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> based on Laurel and Hardy {{throwing}} pies at each other. The <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> rearranged in the editing room; it played out differently when first produced. The edits to this scene were preliminary, but well-received, and remained unchanged in the finished product.|$|E
5|$|The opening <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> filmed {{using the}} Carbide & Carbon Building.|$|E
50|$|Exterior <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> {{filmed in}} Hong Kong Island, Shanghai and Kuala Lumpur. Interior <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> shot in Kuala Lumpur.|$|R
50|$|Most of the Swedish <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> {{filmed in}} the {{province}} of Västergötland. Other <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> filmed in Scotland and Morocco.|$|R
50|$|Much of {{the outdoor}} <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> filmed at Oxburgh Hall in Norfolk. Some {{internal}} <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> filmed at Chawton House in Hampshire, while the railway <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> filmed on the North Norfolk Railway, in particular using Weybourne station {{as a substitute}} for the fictional Arcady station.|$|R
5|$|An action <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> filmed with a motion-control camera, a {{first in}} Indian cinema. Although the {{producers}} {{wanted to keep}} the film's climax (featuring several cricketers from the Indian team and filmed at a Bangalore stadium in June 2004) a secret, it was revealed in the media. Filming wrapped in July 2004.|$|E
5|$|Clooney's {{use of the}} MMU as his {{personal}} jet pack zipping around the spacewalking <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> criticized by Times Jeffery Kluger as being unrealistic. NASA's spacewalks are strictly choreographed in advance.|$|E
5|$|Each {{successive}} {{scene in}} the sequence was shorter {{than the one before}} it by exactly one frame. The scene where Bart writes his confession was done as one long take to balance the shorter scenes elsewhere in the episode. It was animated in the United States by Dan Haskett. There were a few problems with the finished animation for the episode. The banana in the opening <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> colored incorrectly, as the Korean animators were unfamiliar with the fruit, and the final bathtub <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> particularly problematic, including issues with lip sync. The version in the broadcast episode was the best of several attempts.|$|E
50|$|The battle <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> shot in Yugoslavia. Many <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> reused in {{the same}} director's 1964 film The Lion of Thebes.|$|R
50|$|Most cabin <b>scenes</b> <b>are</b> filmed at TVB {{sets and}} most cockpit <b>scenes</b> <b>are</b> either {{on board the}} A330 or the A330 simulator.|$|R

5|$|In post-production, Universal {{decided to}} film a new scene for the ending that would feature a reunion between Stiller and Murphy's characters. Murphy, however, refused to return unless he were paid a further $500,000 {{on top of}} his $7.5million salary. The studio {{declined}} to pay the additional money and the <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> not shot.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} episode the camera follows a BA Falcon, a model of vehicle which was not {{released}} until late 2002. This was some 7 years after the <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> set.|$|E
5|$|In {{the scene}} in which the crew meets Redfoot after the botched drug deal, Redfoot flicks his {{cigarette}} at McManus' face. The <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> originally to have Redfoot flick the cigarette at McManus's chest, but the actor missed and hit Baldwin's face by accident. Baldwin's reaction is genuine.|$|E
50|$|The {{official}} {{filming of}} Mental began in November 2014 in Dhaka. <b>Scenes</b> <b>were</b> filmed in Dhaka, and Sylhet while several <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> filmed abroad.|$|R

The opening <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> filmed at Occidental College, standing in as fictional Pacific Technical College.|$|R
5|$|Lucas {{revisited}} {{the scene}} in the 1997 Special Edition release of A New Hope, restoring the sequence and replacing Mulholland with a CGI version of Jabba the Hutt and the English dialogue with Huttese, a fictional language created by sound designer Ben Burtt. Joseph Letteri, the visual effects supervisor for the Special Edition, explained that the ultimate goal of the revised <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> to make it look as if Jabba the Hutt was actually on the set talking to and acting with Harrison Ford and that the crew had merely photographed it. Letteri stated that the new scene consisted of five shots that took over a year to complete. The <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> polished further for the 2004 release on DVD, improving Jabba's appearance with advancements in CGI techniques, although neither release looks exactly like the original Jabba the Hutt puppet.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scenes of}} the episode {{contained}} backgrounds that were added with digital effects. One such <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> on Danny's ex-wife's house, which did not have mountains in the background; the mountains were digitally added in post-production. The same technique was used again on the village of quonset huts, and again on the freighter assault scenes, only with {{the background of the}} sea when Hesse and McGarrett fight. After the episode was filmed, the producers discovered that it was too long and spent two weeks deciding what to cut out. One of the scenes involved the team deciding on a name of their task force, but that <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> cut in favor of another episode. Manning's scenes were also cut due from the final broadcast to the length, though viewers could still make out {{the top of her head}} in the finished episode.|$|E
5|$|Strange Days was {{released}} on DVD format on August 21, 2001 by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment. The DVD's special features include a 1-hour lecture about how the opening <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> filmed, both the original teaser trailer and theatrical trailer, and two deleted scenes.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>scene</b> <b>is</b> {{a series}} of related shots. It is {{analogous}} to a sentence. The study of transitions between <b>scenes</b> <b>is</b> described in film punctuation.|$|R
50|$|In late August {{to early}} September, filming again moved to Atlanta. From August 28-29 and September 2-6, 2014, more <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> filmed at the Archives Building in Atlanta. Several <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> re-shot {{including}} the train sequence, which was filmed in Fulton County, Georgia on September 3, 2014. A few <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> re-shot in Atlanta from December 17-21, 2014.|$|R
50|$|Most of the {{exterior}} <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> filmed about 30 mi east of Cotulla, Texas on the 35000 acre La Mota Ranch. Other <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> filmed near Laredo, Texas. 2500 Texas Longhorns {{were used for}} the herd. Interior <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> recorded at Paramount Studios in Hollywood. The Texans premiered at San Antonio's Majestic Theater on July 16, 1938.|$|R
5|$|The {{creation}} of {{life from the}} disintegration of an Engineer in the film's opening <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> created by WETA Digital. The <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> difficult to produce because it had to convey {{the story of the}} Engineer's DNA breaking apart, reforming and recombining into Earth DNA in a limited span of time. The team focused on making the DNA stages distinct to convey its changing nature. Scott requested the studio to focus on the destruction occurring within the Engineer. A light color scheme was used for the Engineer's DNA and decayed fish spines were used as an image reference, while the infected DNA had a melted appearance. To find methods of depicting the DNA destruction, the team carved vein-like structures from silicone and pumped black ink and oils into them while filming the changes occurring {{over an extended period of}} time.|$|E
5|$|The dinner <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> {{shot in a}} revamped {{version of}} the Enterprise-D's {{observation}} lounge. Along the wall are portraits of historical figures including Abraham Lincoln, Spock's father Sarek (Mark Lenard), and an unnamed Andorian ambassador. The food prepared for the <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> colored blue so it would look alien. None of the actors wanted to eat the unappetizing dishes (especially after they grew ripe under hot studio lights), {{and it became a}} running joke among the crew during filming to make them sample their food.|$|E
5|$|The {{imposing}} <b>scene</b> <b>was</b> at the Long Bridge, {{where the}} main body of the troops crossed. Eight thousand infantry, two regular cavalry companies and two sections of Sherman's artillery battalion consisting of two batteries, were in line this side of the Long Bridge at two o'clock.|$|E
50|$|Most of the <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> {{filmed in}} Asheville, North Carolina along Highway 19 {{and others at}} Lake Lure. Some <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> filmed in Beech, east of Weaverville. Scenes include Reems Creek Road, Sugar Creek Road and the Beech Community Center. Some <b>scenes</b> <b>were</b> actual local moonshine drivers shot with a camera mounted on a pickup tailgate.|$|R
