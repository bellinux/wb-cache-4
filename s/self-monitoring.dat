5000|$|This can be {{explained}} by the norm of reciprocity because the high <b>self-monitors</b> can pick up on these cues easily and know that they need to respond with their own disclosure. It can also {{be explained}} by social exchange theory. Research shows that high <b>self-monitors</b> are more uncomfortable when paired with a low <b>self-monitor</b> because low <b>self-monitors</b> do not tend to disclose intimate details so the balance in the conversation is uneven. High <b>self-monitors</b> are also shown to be the [...] "pace-setters" [...] of the conversation and generally initiate and maintain the flow of a conversation.|$|R
40|$|The authors {{argue that}} high <b>self-monitors</b> {{may be more}} {{sensitive}} to the status implications of social exchange and more effective in managing their exchange relations to elicit conferrals of status than low <b>self-monitors.</b> In a series of studies, they found that high <b>self-monitors</b> were more accurate in perceiving the status dynamics involved both in a set of fictitious exchange relations and in real relationships involving other members of their social group. Further, high <b>self-monitors</b> elevated their social status among their peers by establishing a reputation as a generous exchange partner. Specifically, they were more likely than low <b>self-monitors</b> to be sought out for help and to refrain from asking others for help. This behavior provides one explanation for why high <b>self-monitors</b> acquire elevated status among their peers—they are more attuned to status dynamics in exchange relations and adapt their behavior in ways that elicit status...|$|R
40|$|Low <b>self-monitors</b> {{are often}} {{described}} as individuals who lack self-presentation concerns. They seem not to adjust their behavior in accordance with situational demands. Instead, their behavior seems to be guided by their inner attitudes, dispositions, and values, and thus their behavior is consistent across time and situations. We question the view that low <b>self-monitors</b> lack self-presentation concerns. In contrast, we argue that low <b>self-monitors</b> care about their self-presentation and that their main self-presentation concern is to appear sincere to others. The {{purpose of the present}} research was to examine whether low <b>self-monitors</b> are concerned about self-presentation. More specifically, we were interested in whether low <b>self-monitors</b> are concerned about appearing to be sincere to others. To test the specific hypothesis, we wanted to distinguish between low self-monitors' desire to "appear" to be sincere from their desire to "be" sincere. Two studies were conducted to test the hypotheses. The results of the self-report measure in Study 1 and the results of Study 2 did not demonstrate that low <b>self-monitors</b> are concerned about appearing sincere. On the other hand, the results of the behavioral measure in Study 1 suggest the need for further research into the possibility that the low <b>self-monitors</b> have self-presentation concerns and that those concerns may derive from a desire to appear to be sincere. Results and their implications are discussed in relation to a traditional view of low <b>self-monitors...</b>|$|R

25|$|The cost of home {{blood glucose}} {{monitoring}} can be substantial {{due to the}} cost of the test strips. In 2006, the consumer cost of each glucose strip ranged from about $0.35 to $1.00. Manufacturers often provide meters at no cost to induce use of the profitable test strips. Type 1 diabetics may test as often as 4 to 10 times a day due to the dynamics of insulin adjustment, whereas type 2 typically test less frequently, especially when insulin is not part of treatment. A recent study on the comparative cost-effectiveness of all options for the <b>self-monitoring</b> of blood glucose funded by the National Health Service in the UK uncovered considerable variation in the price paid, which could not be explained by the availability of advanced meter features. It estimated that a total of £12 m was invested in providing 42 million <b>self-monitoring</b> of blood glucose tests with systems that fail to meet acceptable accuracy standards, and efficiency savings of £23.2 m per annum are achievable if the National Health Service were to disinvest from technologies providing lesser functionality than available alternatives, but at a much higher price.|$|E

Low <b>self-monitors</b> tend to be influenced by their personal values and attitudes, while high <b>self-monitors</b> tend to be influenced by the behavior of those around them. Via a website simulation, college students were presented with one of three types of anti-binge drinking messages: a self-schema message, which highlighted how responsible drinking is consistent with the message recipient’s personal values and attitudes; a social norms message, which explained that most college students drink less than one might think they do; or a control message, which stated in general terms that people can experience a variety of problems from binge drinking. Overall intended drinking behavior in the self-schema message condition was almost identical to that of the social norms message condition, both of which were lower than drinking intentions in the control message condition. When presented with a self-schema matched message, low <b>self-monitors</b> intended to drink less alcohol than did high <b>self-monitors,</b> but these means were not significantly different. However, high <b>self-monitors</b> intended to drink significantly less than did low <b>self-monitors</b> when presented with a social norms message. The results suggest that self-schema matched messages may be effective at reducing binge drinking for most students, and that social norms messages may be equally as effective but only for high <b>self-monitors...</b>|$|R

Where a more effective response is required, heparin can be given (by injection) concomitantly. As a side effect of any anticoagulant, the risk of bleeding is increased, so the international normalized ratio of blood is monitored. <b>Self-monitoring</b> and self-management are safe options for competent patients, though their practice varies. In Germany, about 20% of patients were self-managed while only 1% of U.S. patients did home self-testing (according to one 2012 study).

25|$|Executive {{functioning}} is {{a theoretical}} construct representing a domain of cognitive processes that regulate, control, and manage other cognitive processes. Executive functioning {{is not a}} unitary concept; it is a broad description of the set of processes involved in certain areas of cognitive and behavioural control. Executive processes are integral to higher brain function, particularly {{in the areas of}} goal formation, planning, goal-directed action, <b>self-monitoring,</b> attention, response inhibition, and coordination of complex cognition and motor control for effective performance. Deficits of the executive functions are observed in all populations to varying degrees, but severe executive dysfunction can have devastating effects on cognition and behaviour in both individual and social contexts.|$|E
5000|$|People who closely monitor {{themselves}} are categorized as high <b>self-monitors</b> and often {{behave in a}} manner that is highly responsive to social cues and their situational context. High <b>self-monitors</b> can be thought of as social pragmatists who project images in an attempt to impress others and receive positive feedback.|$|R
50|$|Conversely, low <b>self-monitors</b> do not participate, to {{the same}} degree, in {{expressive}} control and do not share similar concern for situational appropriateness. Low <b>self-monitors</b> tend to exhibit expressive controls congruent with their own internal states; i.e. beliefs, attitudes, and dispositions regardless of social circumstance. Low <b>self-monitors</b> are often less observant of social context and consider expressing a self-presentation dissimilar from their internal states as a falsehood and undesirable. People who are unwilling to <b>self-monitor</b> and adjust their behavior accordingly are often aggressive, uncompromising, and insistent with others. This may make them more prone to condemnation, rejection, and the possible consequent feelings of anger, anxiety, guilt, low self-concept, isolation, and depression. Even the occasional indiscretion can make social situations very awkward, and {{could result in the}} loss of a friend, co-worker, client, or even job. Those who are willing to adjust their behavior will often find that others are more receptive, pleasant, and benevolent towards them.|$|R

25|$|This type {{of therapy}} uses {{a blend of}} cognitive, {{behavioral}} and some humanistic training techniques to target the stressors of the client. This usually is used to help clients better cope with their stress or anxiety after stressful events. This is a three-phase process that trains the client to use skills that they already have to better adapt to their current stressors. The first phase is an interview phase that includes psychological testing, client <b>self-monitoring,</b> {{and a variety of}} reading materials. This allows the therapist to individually tailor the training process to the client. Clients learn how to categorize problems into emotion-focused or problem-focused, so that they can better treat their negative situations. This phase ultimately prepares the client to eventually confront and reflect upon their current reactions to stressors, before looking at ways to change their reactions and emotions in relation to their stressors. The focus is conceptualization.|$|E
25|$|When an {{individual}} tries to suppress thoughts under a high cognitive load, {{the frequency of}} those thoughts increases and becomes more accessible than before. Evidence shows that people can prevent their thoughts from being translated into behavior when <b>self-monitoring</b> is high; this {{does not apply to}} automatic behaviors though, and may result in latent, unconscious actions. This phenomenon is made paradoxically worse by increasing the amount of distractions a person has, although the experiments in this area can be criticized for using impersonal concurrent tasks, {{which may or may not}} properly reflect natural processes or individual differences. Ironic process theory is one cognitive model that can explain the paradoxical effect seen above. However, given the mixed evidence and commensurate with the latest research, it is suggested that such a model needs to account for individual differences. It should also note possible neurological dynamics (see, for instance, obsessive–compulsive disorder), to be considered robust.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, a {{study by}} Lippa (1978) found {{evidence}} for {{the extent to which}} individuals present themselves in a different way. This is called expressive behaviour, and it is dependent upon the individuals' motivation and ability to control that behaviour. Lippa (1978) examined 68 students who were asked to role-play by pretending to teach a math class. The students' level of extraversion and introversion were rated based on their external/expressive behaviours such as stride length, graphic expansiveness, the percentage of time they spent talking, the amount of time they spent making eye contact, and the total time of each teaching session. This study found that actual introverts were perceived and judged as having more extraverted-looking expressive behaviours because they were higher in terms of their <b>self-monitoring.</b> This means that the introverts consciously put more effort into presenting a more extraverted, and rather socially desirable, version of themselves. Thus, individuals are able to regulate and modify behaviour based on their environmental situations.|$|E

25|$|Similarly to the ventral stream's {{auditory}} processing, information {{enters the}} ear {{and then into}} the superior temporal gyrus and then finally the superior temporal sulcus. From there the information moves {{to the beginning of the}} dorsal pathway, which is located at the boundary of the temporal and parietal lobes near the Sylvian fissure. The first step of the dorsal pathway begins in the sensorimotor interface, located in the left Sylvian parietal temporal (Spt) (within the Sylvian fissure at the parietal-temporal boundary). The spt is important for perceiving and reproducing sounds. This is evident because its ability to acquire new vocabulary, be disrupted by lesions and auditory feedback on speech production, articulatory decline in late-onset deafness and the non-phonological residue of Wernicke's aphasia; deficient <b>self-monitoring.</b> It is also important for the basic neuronal mechanisms for phonological short-term memory. Without the Spt, language acquisition is impaired. The information then moves onto the articulatory network, which is divided into two separate parts. The articulatory network 1, which processes motor syllable programs, is located in the left posterior inferior temporal gyrus and Brodmann's area 44 (pIFG-BA44). The articulatory network 2 is for motor phoneme programs and is located in the left M1-vBA6.|$|E
25|$|Elderspeak is a {{specialized}} speech style used by younger adults when addressing older adults. The speaker makes accommodations that include producing shorter, less complex sentences, using simpler vocabulary, filler words, fragmented sentences, lexical filters, and repetition. Elderspeak also includes using {{terms that are}} overly endearing, asking closed questions that prompt an answer, and using the collective “we”. Young people tend to speak at a slower rate and include more pauses when communicating with elders. This speech style is often patronizing in nature and resembles baby talk. Elderspeak stems from a reliance on stereotypes about cognitive abilities of older persons, and its use may {{be a result of}} or contribute to ageism, a form of discrimination based on age differences. Young people tend to believe that aging is associated with cognitive declines, including declines in language processing and production. However, this speech pattern is primarily based on stereotypes, as evidenced by its use in situations where older adults are clearly functioning well. When conversing with older persons, younger people often accommodate their speech based on their personal evaluation of their conversation partner’s ability, rather than their actual ability. Working to overcome elderspeak through awareness and <b>self-monitoring</b> as well as through formal educational programs are strategies individuals and other care providers can use to promote successful aging for older clients. Therefore, although some aspects of elderspeak may be beneficial for some recipients, it is generally seen as inappropriate and can hinder intergenerational communication.|$|E
