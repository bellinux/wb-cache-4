Virginia Rohan of The Record of Bergen County, New Jersey, called the episode [...] "gripping" [...] and [...] "another strong start for a terrific series".|$|E

2500|$|In 1966 Brett {{successfully}} {{applied to}} be a music journalist at pop music weekly, Go-Set, and in May she replaced founding feature writer, Doug Panther. She later reflected, [...] "My career is inexplicable and it's a career path that nobody should follow! It basically starts with an 18-year old refusing {{to go to}} university {{because that was the}} one thing that my parents wanted of me, that and to be slim. So I defied both of those desires. My mother said I had to get a job, which <b>shocked</b> <b>me.</b> There was a new newspaper opening up in Australia called Go-Set and I walked into the office and I started work the next day. I don't think this would happen today." [...] The paper's editor was Tony Schauble, and according to Go-Set staff photographer, Colin Beard, [...] " [...] had been to see Schauble several times and had made a favourable impression on him and more importantly, she had a car, which was an attractive incentive to employ her."

[...] Adam Markovitz of the same publication described the documentary as a [...] "delicate mix of the calculated and confessional, designed to let us just far enough into Knowles' world to keep us interested in her next tour, album, soda allegiance, etc." [...] Carrie Battan from Pitchfork wrote that [...] "there's no unturned insight, no secret to be discovered in this documentary besides the fact that she's simply everything we want her to be."
