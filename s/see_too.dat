25|$|As Mk. I {{arrived in}} the field, a number of {{improvements}} in the basic electronics were introduced. These were collected together to form the Mk. I* version. The differences between the Mk. I and Mk. I* were primarily in details. It was found that in certain orientations of the transmitter and receiver, the small antenna used to trigger the time base would <b>see</b> <b>too</b> small a signal to work. This {{was replaced by a}} cable between the two cabins, which was known as cable locking. Certain details of the RF stages on the receiver improved signal-to-noise ratio, a voltage regulator was added to correct for differences in generators, and a new system was introduced that replaced the complex grounding system for the potentiometer with an electronic version. A more major change was the introduction of anti-jamming features.|$|E
500|$|In {{its first}} week, Lost in the Sound of Separation debuted at No. 8 on the Billboard 200 charts, selling around 56,000 copies in the US alone. In December 2008, Underoath won Best Hardcore/Screamo Artist at the Rock on Request Awards and {{embarked}} {{on their first}} South American Tour. The band played six concerts in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Colombia, and played at Warped Tour 2009. On international tours in 2009, Underoath began writing pieces of new songs for their fifth studio release. The songs [...] "Desperate Times, Desperate Measures" [...] and [...] "Too Bright to <b>See,</b> <b>Too</b> Loud to Hear" [...] were released as the two singles from the album.|$|E

The second single from the album, [...] "Too Bright to <b>See,</b> <b>Too</b> Loud to Hear" [...] was {{released}} April 20, 2009, and the music video for the song was the winning video created by a contestant in a contest exclusive to the United Kingdom. The song was released to radio on June 2.|$|E
2500|$|Tahir {{qualified}} for South Africa on 1 January 2011, and {{was selected by}} them for the 2011 Cricket World Cup. Although {{he was part of}} South Africa's squad to play a five-match ODI series against India before the World Cup, Tahir did not make his debut. Captain Graeme Smith explained that this was because [...] " [...] is someone we want to keep fresh and we didn't want to give people the opportunity to <b>see</b> <b>too</b> much of him." ...|$|E

2500|$|Throughout their career, Dream Theater's live {{shows have}} {{gradually}} become bigger, {{longer and more}} diverse. Prior to Portnoy's departure, Dream Theater [...] "rotated" [...] its set lists to ensure that fans who attended multiple shows {{in the same area}} will not <b>see</b> <b>too</b> many (or any) songs repeated. [...] Portnoy, who constructed the set lists, would take into account the set list from the last time the band was in a particular city for the benefit of fans who saw the band on successive tours.|$|E
2500|$|Martin {{has said}} he {{believes}} in [...] "judicious use of magic" [...] in epic fantasy. [...] "I {{wanted to keep the}} magic in my book subtle and keep our sense of it growing, and it stops being magical if you <b>see</b> <b>too</b> much of it." [...] Effective magic in literature, Martin claims, needs to be [...] "unknowable and strange and dangerous with forces that can't be predicted or controlled." [...] Before A Song of Ice and Fire, Martin initially considered writing an alternate historical novel without any magic. He therefore avoided overtly magical elements in the series. While the amount of magic gradually increases, Martin claims the series will end with less magic than many other fantasies have.|$|E
2500|$|When used together, the SB-300 {{receiver}} and SB-400 transmitter could transceive and had many other {{features of the}} S/Line, including crystal bandwidth filters and 1kHz tuning dial resolution. They could also operate separately (if the optional crystal pack was installed in the transmitter), giving the operator more flexibility in talking to foreign stations who could not transmit in the same range as the U.S. stations could. The S/Line influence was easy to <b>see</b> <b>too,</b> in its cabinet styling, tuning mechanism and knobs. [...] But by designing them as kits and using less expensive construction, Heathkit could offer these units at much lower prices. [...] The pair sold for $590 that first year (equivalent to about $ today). [...] The matching SB-200 1200-watt input/700-800-watt output linear amplifier completed the line for 1965.|$|E

2500|$|Corry was {{a staunch}} {{advocate}} of Irish republicanism, strongly opposed to Partition, antipathetic to the United Kingdom, and sometimes bluntly outspoken within the Dáil chamber. In 1928, he criticised the Cumann na nGaedheal government's expenditure on the diplomatic corps, stating [...] "These salaries of £1,500 {{have to be}} paid so that they might squat like the nigger when he put on the black silk hat and the swallow-tail coat and went out and said he was an English gentleman." [...] His opposition to the Blueshirts in the early 1930s provoked an attempt to burn down his house. In the 1938 debate on the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement which ceded the Treaty Ports to the Irish state, Corry expressed regret that Northern Ireland remained excluded, suggesting [...] "I personally am in favour of storing up sufficient poison gas, so that when you get the wind in the right direction you can start at the Border and let it travel, and follow it." [...] In a 1942 debate on exporting food to Great Britain during World War II, Corry remarked about food shortages there that [...] "They have no more rabbits to get, and now they are on the crows", and [...] "I would not like to <b>see</b> <b>too</b> many crows going out to feed them. I think the crows are too good for them". Patrick Giles called Corry a [...] "", and Alfie Byrne persisted in demanding an apology for the [...] "unchristian" [...] comments to the point of himself being suspended from the chamber.|$|E
2500|$|Most fellow {{tennis players}} reacted {{negatively}} to her announcement, {{with almost no}} support or sympathy in general for Sharapova. John McEnroe and Pat Cash said they {{found it hard to}} believe her. Jennifer Capriati posted on Twitter that she should be stripped of her 35 professional titles. Chris Evert expressed her surprise at the lack of support in tennis for Sharapova, noting that she [...] " [...] always isolated herself {{from the rest of the}} tennis world, from the players". Serena Williams expressed surprise at Sharapova’s announcement but commended her for being [...] "upfront with what she had done". Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray all publicly condemned Sharapova and argued that she deserved to be punished on the basis that she failed the doping test, with Murray adding that [...] "Taking a drug you don't necessarily need because it's legal is wrong" [...] and Federer stating that [...] "Whether it's intentional or not, I don't <b>see</b> <b>too</b> much difference. You must be 100 percent about what you are taking". Sharapova's case prompted Federer to urge the tennis federation to conduct more anti-doping tests. Novak Djokovic said that he felt sorry for her, but that she must still be ready for punishment. Victoria Azarenka and Dominika Cibulkova were far less supportive, with Cibulkova adding that she didn't feel sorry at all for Sharapova and didn't miss having her on the tour, describing her as [...] "a totally unlikeable person; arrogant, conceited, and cold". The Russian Tennis Federation strongly defended Sharapova, describing the positive drug test as [...] "nonsense" [...] and adding that they expected Sharapova to be available for the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.|$|E
