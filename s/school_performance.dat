5|$|Cerebral malaria {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of {{neurological}} disabilities in African children. Studies comparing cognitive functions before and after treatment for severe malarial illness continued to show significantly impaired <b>school</b> <b>performance</b> and cognitive abilities even after recovery. Consequently, severe and cerebral malaria have far-reaching socioeconomic consequences that extend beyond the immediate effects of the disease.|$|E
5|$|During childhood, malaria causes anemia {{during a}} period of rapid brain development, and also direct brain damage {{resulting}} from cerebral malaria. Some survivors of cerebral malaria have an increased risk of neurological and cognitive deficits, behavioural disorders, and epilepsy. Malaria prophylaxis was shown to improve cognitive function and <b>school</b> <b>performance</b> in clinical trials when compared to placebo groups.|$|E

40|$|Notwithstanding the {{increasing}} researches {{on the role}} of leadership in <b>schools</b> <b>performance,</b> there is a dearth of studies that have investigated the influence of instructional leadership on <b>schools</b> <b>performance</b> in the Zimbabwe context. Therefore, using a data set of 120 from teachers in Harare Province, Zimbabwe, this study examines these relationships. The hypothesis that instructional leadership positively influences <b>schools</b> <b>performance</b> was supported.

30|$|To {{illustrate}} the practical restrictions imposed {{by each of}} the different models, empirical specifications and conditions for causal identification, we will use a simple and widely studied question in the education and labour economics literatures: How is a teenager’s <b>schooling</b> <b>performance</b> influenced by his friends? This is also a question of great policy interest. 4 More specifically, this paper will {{provide an overview of}} methods that can yield answers to questions such as ‘Is a teenager’s <b>schooling</b> <b>performance</b> influenced by the average <b>schooling</b> <b>performance</b> of her friends?’; ‘Do teenagers gain more utility from studying if their friends also study?’; ‘What is the relative importance of the average <b>schooling</b> <b>performance</b> of a teenager’s friends, and of complementarities arising from one’s friends’ studying decisions in shaping a teenager’s overall schooling performance?’; and ‘How does a student’s popularity influence his/her schooling performance?’ The same methods can also be applied to answer analogous questions about interactions between many other types of agents.|$|R

5|$|Attention deficit {{hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) is a mental disorder of the neurodevelopmental type. It is characterized by problems paying attention, excessive activity, or difficulty controlling behavior which is not appropriate for a person's age. The symptoms appear before a person is twelve years old, are present {{for more than six}} months, and cause problems in at least two settings (such as school, home, or recreational activities). In children, problems paying attention may result in poor <b>school</b> <b>performance.</b> Although it causes impairment, particularly in modern society, many children with ADHD have a good attention span for tasks they find interesting.|$|E
5|$|The {{most recent}} report in 2009 {{contained}} data for 34 schools in 15 districts during the 2007-2008 school year. The average <b>school</b> <b>performance</b> score for schools in that report was 52.9, compared to 86.3 statewide. The average classroom instructional expenditure per student was $6,416 among these schools, compared to $5,924 statewide. About 91 {{percent of students}} in this report were in poverty, compared to 63.2 percent statewide. The schools in this report had higher teacher turnover than the statewide average and a slightly higher percentage of uncertified teachers than the state average.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study were (1) to {{ascertain}} for Literature major, Mathematics-Physics major, and General Pedagogy major, the significance {{of the relationship between the}} <b>school's</b> <b>performance</b> in each required course and their overall performance in the State Examinations; (2) to investigate for each major the significance of the relationship between the <b>school's</b> <b>performance</b> in all the required courses and their overall performance in the State Examinitations; (3) to develop for each major, a prediction equation to be used to predict <b>school's</b> <b>performance</b> in the State Examinitations; and (4) to analyze the degree of concordance, across teh three majors, in the ways courses common to them correlated with the State Examinations. A total of 58 rural and urban schools from Shaba Province were used in this study. Twelve offered Literature major and presented 275 candidates, sixteen offered Mathematics-Physics major and had 300 candidates, and twenty-eight offeredd General-Pedagogy major with 935 candidates. All these schools participated in the State Examinations in June 1976. A correlation matrix was developed for each major, using the Statistical Package for the Social Science (S. P. S. S). In this matrix each variable was compared singly with the other variables. Stepwise multiple regression analyses were completed for each major, in order to identify courses contributing significantly to the <b>school's</b> <b>performance</b> in the State Examinations. The results of these analyses were used to develop, for each major, an equation to be used to predit <b>school's</b> <b>performance</b> in the State Examinations. A multiple correlation coefficient was computed for each major, to test for the signigicance of the relationship between the <b>school's</b> <b>performance</b> in all the required coursed and their overall performance in the State Examinations. A kendall's coefficient of concordance was computed and its significance tested. The following findings were established from the analyses: 1. In each major, certain required courses contributed significantly to <b>school's</b> <b>performance</b> in the State Examinations. 2. The overall correlation in each major, between the <b>school's</b> <b>performance</b> in all the required courses and their performance in the State Examinations was significant. 3. A prediction equation was developed for each major. 4. The courses common to the three majors did not contribut to the <b>school's</b> <b>performance,</b> in the same way, across the three majors.

From 1925 to 1927 he worked as a sales clerk for the Oberösterreichische Elektrobau AG radio company.

A literature review of 44 papers states that cognitive abilities and <b>school</b> <b>performance</b> were shown to be impaired in sub-groups of patients (with either cerebral malaria or uncomplicated malaria) when compared with healthy controls.
