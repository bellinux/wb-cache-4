Variations of the standard models were sometimes produced for export to France or England; there are single manual harpsichords with chromatic basses (rather than the short octave) down to C, probably intended for England, and double manual harpsichords with a lower-manual range of GG to [...] produced for France, the lower manual being at standard pitch and the upper a 4th below, reversing the usual pitch arrangement. The lower manual range of these instruments suits the music of contemporary French harpsichord composers such as Chambonnières and Louis Couperin, while the upper manual range is close to early French organ design.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Dynamic walking gaits which exploit {{inverted}} pendulum dynamics {{have demonstrated}} significant promise for biped robot locomotion. For example, these gaits {{can reduce the}} energy expended and the number and complexity of actuators required for level-ground walking. However, robot walkers employing dynamic gaits are, in general, also notoriously sensitive to terrain variations. In this paper, we focus on new methods for developing improved control strategies for and analyzing resulting stability of a simple yet effective model for biped walking on rough terrain. Our primary contributions are as follows. (1) We quantify the stabilizing value of adding a torso to the <b>standard</b> <b>compass</b> gait model; (2) we optimize a class of simple controllers on this walker to be robust to unsensed changes in upcoming terrain height; and (3) we develop improved numerical tools for estimating the statistics of fall events for rough terrain walking. Our {{results indicate that the}} torso walker can handle unanticipated step changes in terrain of approximately 14 % of leg length, and that our statistical tools are effective for a 6 -dimensional state space system, indicating promise in the challenge of addressing the curse of dimensionality when applying machine learning techniques to rough terrain walking.

40|$|Objectives : Although {{the major}} {{determinants}} of gait described by Saunders and colleagues {{have been accepted}} for more than 40 years, recent investigations {{raise the question of}} whether the reduction in center of mass (COM) displacement compared with a compass gait model indeed results from the factors originally described. We tested the hypothesis that heel rise at the end of stance is a true determinant that can explain a considerable portion of the reduction in COM vertical displacement during walking. Design : Stereophotogrammetric data during walking were collected. A modified compass gait model incorporating the effect of heel rise, as compared with predictions based on a <b>standard</b> <b>compass</b> model, were used to estimate the isolated effect of heel rise on reducing the vertical displacement of COM. Setting: A gait laboratory. Participants : Thirty able-bodied subjects. Main Outcome Measure : The estimated reduction in COM displacement due to heel rise was compared with the actual reduction in displacement. Results : The estimated effect of heel rise on reduction in COM displacement was 23. 4 ± 7. 6 mm, whereas the actual reduction in COM displacement was 21. 2 ± 6. 5 mm (difference not significant, paired p =. 185). Conclusion : During normal walking, heel rise from foot flat has a considerable role in raising the height of the COM when it is at its lowest, thus reducing its overall displacement. Insofar as reduction of COM vertical displacement may have important energy implications, appreciating the specific gait parameter of heel rise is key in rehabilitative approaches to improve gait disability. </br...|$|E

25|$|A solar compass is a {{railroad}} compass with a solar attachment that allows surveyors {{to determine the}} north direction by reference to the sun rather than by reference to the magnetic needle. It consists of three arcs: one for setting the latitude of the land to be surveyed; one for setting the declination of the sun; and one for setting the hour of the day. In 1835, the solar compass was invented by William Austin Burt, a U.S. Deputy Surveyor who began surveying government lands in the Michigan Territory earlier in 1833. While experiencing great difficulty in using his <b>standard</b> vernier <b>compass</b> in order to detect deposits of iron ore in the Northwest Territory (present-day Wisconsin), Burt devised the solar compass so that garbled readings of the Earth's magnetic field and north-south survey lines {{would be easier to}} find.

We present an exploratory study using a waypoint plotting task to compare the <b>standard</b> magnetic <b>compass</b> against a military GPS unit, for both expert and non-expert navigators. Whilst performance times were generally longer in setting up the GPS unit, once navigation was underway the GPS was more efficient than the compass. For mediumto long-term missions, this means that GPS could offer significant performance benefits, although the compass remains superior for shorter missions. Notwithstanding the performance times, significantly more errors, and more serious errors, occurred when using the compass. Overall, then, the GPS offers some clear advantages, especially for non-expert users. Nonetheless, concerns over the development of cognitive maps remain when using GPS technologies...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies on}} European robins, Erithacus rubecula, and Australian silvereyes, Zosterops lateralis, had {{suggested}} that magnetic compass information is being processed only in the right eye and left brain hemisphere of migratory birds. However, recently it was demonstrated that both garden warblers, Sylvia borin, and European robins have a magnetic compass in both eyes. These results raise the question if the strong lateralization effect observed in earlier experiments might have arisen from artifacts or from differences in experimental conditions rather than reflecting a true all-or-none lateralization of the magnetic compass in European robins. Here we show that (1) European robins having only their left eye open can orient in their seasonally appropriate direction both during autumn and spring, i. e. there are no strong lateralization differences between the outward journey and the way home, that (2) their directional choices {{are based on the}} <b>standard</b> inclination <b>compass</b> as they are turned 180 ° when the inclination is reversed, and that (3) the capability to use the magnetic compass does not depend on monocular learning or intraocular transfer as it is already present in the first tests of the birds with only one eye open...|$|R
5000|$|The {{liquid compass}} is a design {{in which the}} {{magnetized}} needle or card is damped by fluid to protect against excessive swing or wobble, improving readability while reducing wear. A rudimentary working model of a liquid compass was introduced by Sir Edmund Halley {{at a meeting of}} the Royal Society in 1690. [...] However, as early liquid compasses were fairly cumbersome and heavy, and subject to damage, their main advantage was aboard ship. Protected in a binnacle and normally gimbal-mounted, the liquid inside the compass housing effectively damped shock and vibration, while eliminating excessive swing and grounding of the card caused by the pitch and roll of the vessel. The first liquid mariner's compass believed practicable for limited use was patented by the Englishman Francis Crow in 1813. [...] Liquid-damped marine compasses for ships and small boats were occasionally used by the Royal Navy from the 1830s through 1860, but the <b>standard</b> Admiralty <b>compass</b> remained a dry-mount type. [...] In the latter year, the American physicist and inventor Edward Samuel Ritchie patented a greatly improved liquid marine compass that was adopted in revised form for general use by the United States Navy, and later purchased by the Royal Navy as well.|$|R

50|$|Other {{innovations}} {{included the}} square-pallet bilge pump, which {{was adopted by}} the West during the 16th century for work ashore, the western chain pump, which was adopted for shipboard use, being of a different derivation. Junks also relied on the compass for navigational purposes. However, as with almost all vessels of any culture before the late 19th century, the accuracy of magnetic compasses aboard ship, whether from a failure to understand deviation (the magnetism of the ship's iron fastenings) or poor design of the <b>compass</b> card (the <b>standard</b> drypoint <b>compasses</b> were extremely unstable), meant that they did little to contribute to the accuracy of navigation by dead reckoning. Indeed, a review of the evidence shows that the Chinese embarked magnetic pointer was probably little used for navigation. The reasoning is simple. Chinese mariners were as able as any and, had they needed a compass to navigate, they would have been aware of the almost random directional qualities when used at sea of the water bowl compass they used. Yet that design remained unchanged for some half a millennium. Western sailors, coming upon a similar water bowl design (no evidence as to how has yet emerged) very rapidly adapted it in a series of significant changes such that within roughly a century the water bowl had given way to the dry pivot, a rotating compass card a century later, a lubberline a generation later and gimbals seventy or eight years later. These were necessary because in the more adverse climatic context of north western Europe, the compass was needed for navigation. Had similar needs been felt in China, Chinese mariners would also have come up with fixes. They didn't.|$|R

The instrument was then submitted to a committee at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia. They examined its principles and merits and ultimately awarded Burt twenty dollars in gold and the John Legacy Medal. He improved on his surveying instrument and in 1840 re-submitted it to the Franklin Institute. The instrument was further improved over the years and in 1851 he exhibited that version at the Great Exhibition in London, where he was awarded another prize medal. He then received another medal by jurors of Astronomical Instruments.|$|R
