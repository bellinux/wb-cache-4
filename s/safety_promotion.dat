Thus, SafetyLit draws its content from many disciplines. Articles are selected that are relevant to the issues of injury prevention and <b>safety</b> <b>promotion</b> from over 16000 scholarly journals (as of January 2016) in the physical, biological and social sciences, as well as engineering, medicine, and the applied social sciences. SafetyLit also indexes selected doctoral theses and relevant technical reports from government agencies and NGOs.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: We {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} patient safety culture and safety care activity, and identified factors for safety care activity of entry-level nurses. Methods: The subjects {{of the study were}} 204 entry-level nurses working at five general and advanced hospitals with over 500 beds located in C and D City. The data were analyzed using descriptive analysis, t-test, ANOVA, Pearson’s correlation and hierarchical multiple regression with SPSS/WIN 18. 0 program. Results: Perception of patient safety culture had significant correlations with safety care activity. Multiple regression analysis showed that demographic variables of quality of nursing on patient safety and health state of entry-level nurses affected safety care activity. In addition, patient safety culture in ward and communication affected safety care activity. These factors explained 38 % of variance.

Health clinics {{for people who are}} experiencing homelessness offer an opportunity to create health-promoting places. In this study, we explore how place is experienced within a community health clinic for people who are experiencing homelessness. A critical ethnographic methodology was used. Results illustrate how clients and providers contested the space of the clinic. Discourses of <b>safety,</b> health <b>promotion,</b> and privacy were enacted, altered, and resisted in a constant practice of culture-making. Physical components of the space became conceptual components of how place and power in place were understood by clients and providers. Results point to the importance of conceptualizing service users as the key stakeholders in their care, considering how places may be more or less health promoting, and rethinking how safety is conceptualized...|$|R
