25|$|Sure, {{there have}} been controversies as well. Naya Daur (right) was one instance, thanks to the Madhubala episode. She was a fine person, it was merely that in this one instance, things went badly wrong. For my film she did about ten days work and then her father refused {{to allow her to}} go {{outdoors}} {{for the rest of the}} shoot - I was never sure why. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>took</b> Vyjayanthimala for the role and her father filed a suit against us.|$|E
500|$|Vocalist Karl Willetts of {{the death}} metal band Bolt Thrower asserts the record was an {{inspiration}} for the band: [...] "When Slayer's Haunting the Chapel came out I had never heard anything like that before with that style of guitar playing. We were punks and heavy metal was alien to our upbringing. And other bands we heard like Venom, Slaughter and Metallica. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>took</b> the elements of musicianship from metal and the aggression of punk and poured it all together." [...] Chuck Schuldiner of the band Death said the record was [...] "life changing at the time" [...] asserting, [...] "That was {{some of the early}} stuff that gave me that push." ...|$|E

[...] This was disproved in Cruft's memoirs, published posthumously in Charles Cruft's Dog Book in 1952, where Cruft explained that he had lived in households which had Alsatians and Borzois. He went on to make particular reference {{to the fact that he}} and his wife Emma had owned at least one Saint Bernard; the same breed of dog he had used in his creation of the Crufts logo.|$|E

500|$|Visual Effects Supervisor Tim Burke {{said that}} [...] "It {{was such a}} major job to stage the Battle of Hogwarts, {{and we had to}} do it in {{different}} stages of production. We had shots with complex linking camera moves from wide overviews, to flying into windows and interior spaces. <b>So,</b> <b>we</b> <b>took</b> the plunge at the end of 2008, and started rebuilding the school digitally with Double Negative." [...] He {{went on to say that}} [...] "It's taken two years– getting renders out, texturing every facet of the building, constructing interiors to see through windows, building a destruction version of the school. We can design shots with the knowledge that we have this brilliant digital miniature that we can do anything with. With a practical Hogwarts, we would have shot it last summer and been so tied down. Instead, as David Yates finds the flow and structure, we are able to handle new concepts and ideas." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's {{accompanying}} {{music video}} was filmed in Los Angeles by Liz Friedlander, who didn't know Clarkson at the time. Friedlander remarked, [...] "Honestly, I never watched American Idol, so I didn't have a preconceived notion of her." [...] She {{said about the}} video, [...] "The song is explosive and young and has some cool electronic beats, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>took</b> the visual style from the music." [...] Clarkson added [...] "It's gonna be more Kelly Clarkson the artist, not [...] from American Idol." [...] The video features Clarkson performing at a house party in reverse, starting from the morning after and working its {{way back to the}} previous night, where she appears attracted to a [...] "surfer" [...] whom she keeps seeing in mirrors. Friedlander adds, [...] "And in the end — maybe — they get together." [...] It premiered on MTV on June 2, 2003. The video received three nominations at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards—Best New Artist in a Video, Best Pop Video, and Viewer's Choice Award.|$|E
500|$|Another VFX {{supervisor}} from Zoic Studios, Andrew Orloff, {{believed the}} episode's special effects were {{possibly the most}} difficult of the season. He wrote, [...] "Originally, {{it was supposed to be}} a practical effect but they couldn't get it to fall in a natural way, so what we had to do was shoot the practical elements in pieces and we put them all together and timed all those plates and ended up rebuilding a significant part of it and tying it all together in CG. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>took</b> a cyberscan of the guy's body, and on top of all the practical elements we used as a base, we had a matte painting, a reveal matte painting of the cracks that ran through the body, 3D particles of large chunks of ash falling out, 3D particles of small ash bits floating down, residual dust flying off of it and, at one point, his head falls off and crashes to the ground as ash. So we had to do a full-CG head and tumble it down the body. That was pretty complicated and entailed lots of R there was 2D work in After Effects, tracking, retiming, we did a lot of CG lighting for the body parts in Maya/mental ray and all of the particles were a combination of Maya software, and rendered in Maya/mental ray." ...|$|E

500|$|In January 2007, it was {{reported}} that May and England defender Glen Johnson were caught at a B store in Dartford, Kent, attempting to steal bathroom fittings. They both received £80 fines. Johnson described the incident as [...] "comical" [...] because it was a misunderstanding — [...] "Ben was doing up his bathroom so we went to B and found one of those sets where you get everything in one box. But he wanted a seat with a slow-close lid, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>took</b> out the seat and put in another one. What we didn't know was that the new seat was £2.35 more expensive. We went through the till, paid for it and then the security guard stopped us and said he had been watching on CCTV. We just burst out laughing. Where's Jeremy Beadle then? But he said, 'No, this is serious, the police are on their way.' The police turned up and they were laughing. I said to the security guard, 'Can we not just pay the £2.35?'" [...] He said, 'No, this is a serious offence.' So the police gave us two options: go to court and fight it out, or pay an on-the-spot fine. We couldn't be bothered going to court so we paid the fine but doing that made us look guilty".|$|E

2500|$|I {{thought is}} disgraceful that the Australian Rugby Union would not send its best team. But the blame cannot be laid {{at their feet}} alone. The egotist coaches at Super 12 level {{did not want to}} {{jeopardise}} their Super 12 prospects by releasing any of their star players. <b>So</b> <b>we</b> <b>took</b> a team minus the top players in Australia. The ARU had the view that Australia should target winning a Super 12 title, via the Brumbies, Waratahs or Reds, rather than pooling the best of their resources for a tilt at the World Cup Sevens Crown. Just another example of the professional age.|$|E

2500|$|Blizzard {{felt they}} had {{strength}} in developing a narrative for a large universe of characters as they had done for Warcraft. Chu expressed {{that they wanted to}} diverge from the fantasy and science fiction elements that were prominent in their main three franchises (Warcraft, StarCraft, and Diablo), stating [...] "we wanted to try something different with Overwatch, so what we decided to go for was the future of Earth. We always wanted the game to be about heroes, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>took</b> a lot of inspiration from comics and superhero stories of our youth and today." [...] Once it was determined Overwatch would be played on a near-futuristic version of Earth, the writers recognized the possibility of having a global-spanning set of characters and locations set in an [...] "inspirational future". Metzen sees the Overwatch universe as having potential dynamics over time, but Blizzard does not yet have plans for how to implement this within the game.|$|E

[...] Favreau expressed desire in wanting the film's 3D shots to imbue the abilities of the multiplane camera system utilized in Disney's earlier animated films. At Favreau's behest, the idea was extended into the film's version of the Walt Disney Pictures opening production logo, which was recreated as [...] "a hand-painted, cel-animated multi-plane logo" [...] in homage to the animated films of that era, also incorporating the word [...] "Presents" [...] in the same style as the 1967 film's opening credits.
