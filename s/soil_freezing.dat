40|$|Two {{shortfalls}} in estimating {{current and}} future seasonal budgets of methane efflux in Arctic regions are the paucity of non-summer measurements and an incomplete understanding of the sensitivity of methane emissions to changes in tundra moisture. A recent study in one Arctic region highlighted the former by observing a previously unknown large methane pulse during the onset of autumn <b>soil</b> <b>freeze.</b> This study addresses these research gaps by presenting an analysis of eddy covariance measurements of methane efflux and supporting environmental variables during the autumn season of 2009 and associated soil freeze-in period at our large-scale water manipulation site near Barrow, Alaska (the Biocomplexity Experiment). We found that methane emissions during the autumn were closely tied to liquid soil moisture in the top 30 cm of soil. Declines in soil moisture between manipulated wet, intermediate, and dry conditions {{as well as through}} time during the soil freeze-in period led to corresponding declines in methane efflux. During the period of soil freeze-in (from 23 September to 28 October), we estimate that our wet section emitted 623 mg CH 4 m− 2 while the dry section emitted only 253 mg CH 4 m− 2 , the average of which represents 18 % of net emissions from the typically measured growing season. We did not find evidence for a pulse in methane emissions during <b>soil</b> <b>freeze</b> at this site. Results from this study imply that future changes in tundra moisture will have a large effect on methane emissions in this region, and changes which span the saturation point are likely to have the largest effect. We speculate that changes in autumn soil moisture are also likely to affect winter emissions via the insulative effects of ice on winter soil temperature and liquid soil moisture availability after bulk <b>soil</b> <b>freeze.</b> Further research should expand the use of eddy covariance methane flux measurements to investigate ecosystem-level effects of tundra moisture on autumn and winter methane emissions in this and other Arctic regions...|$|R

50|$|In some warm climates, {{such as the}} {{subtropical}} savanna and Sonoran Deserts or in the drier Mediterranean climates, {{the growing}} season {{is limited by the}} availability of water, with little growth in the dry season. Unlike in cooler climates where snow or <b>soil</b> <b>freezing</b> is a generally insurmountable obstacle to plant growth, it is often possible to greatly extend the growing season in hot climates by irrigation using water from cooler and/or wetter regions. This can in fact {{go so far as to}} allow year-round growth in areas that without irrigation could only support xerophytic plants.Also in these tropical regions; the growing season can be interrupted by periods of heavy rainfall, called the rainy season.

However, in Indonesia, another large coffee-producing area, they experience this rainy season and the growth of the coffee beans is interrupted.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to being manipulated for medical and energy applications, capillary pressure is the cause behind various natural phenomena as well. For example, needle ice, seen in cold soil, occurs via capillary action. The first major contributions {{to the study of}} needle ice, or simply, frost heaving were made by Stephen Taber (1929) and Gunnar Beskow (1935), who independently aimed to understand <b>soil</b> <b>freezing.</b> Taber’s initial work was related to understanding how the size of pores within the ground influenced the amount of frost heave. He also discovered that frost heave is favorable for crystal growth and that a gradient of soil moisture tension drives water upward toward the freezing front {{near the top of the}} ground. In Beskow’s studies, he defined this soil moisture tension as “capillary pressure” (and soil water as “capillary water”). Beskow determined that the soil type and effective stress on the soil particles influenced frost heave, where effective stress is the sum of pressure from above ground and the capillary pressure.|$|E
5000|$|Yellow-Cedar decline {{began in}} about 1880 which coincides with a warming {{of the climate}} after the Little Ice Age. The {{mechanics}} of this process are still hypothetical, but evidence suggests that soil exposure to cold temperatures {{due to lack of}} canopy cover or wetness of soils can lead to freezing injury of yellow-cedar. Open canopy conditions in the forest expose soils to freezing temperatures. As regional temperatures warm, precipitation falls as rain more often than snow in the winter. Snow packs in the winter offer some insulation to root systems from freezing, the absence of this snow pack allows for <b>soil</b> <b>freezing.</b> As soils freeze, root tissues, especially those in wet soils, suffer damage and can lead to tree mortality. Yellow-Cedar is found to be significantly less cold hardy than tree species surrounding it, such as the Western Hemlock, which was found to deharden at almost 13 °C less than the Yellow-Cedar in comparable conditions ...|$|E
40|$|In {{regions where}} there is deep {{penetration}} of seasonal <b>freezing</b> of fine-grained <b>soil</b> {{there is a serious}} problem of preventing frost heave of the foundations. A method considered here to provide a stable foundation for the structure is to anchor the footing in unfrozen soil. A foundation anchored in unfrozen ground resists heaving forces generated along the contact surface between the foundation wall and the layer of <b>freezing</b> <b>soil.</b> Before <b>freezing,</b> the load of the structure, the weight of the foundation and the weight of the soil above it are given by the stress acting along the foot of the foundation. When the upper layer of <b>soil</b> <b>freezes</b> heaving forces are generated along the lateral surfaces of the foundation wall which partially or fully counteracts the above mentioned load, thus decreasing or completely cancelling the footing pressure. A further consideration is the inclusion of swelling or "release pressures" beneath the footing when the foundation is being lifted up. Equations are provided to calculate all the forces and to also calculate a factor of safety. Numerical examples complete the presentation. An important factor not considered yet is the question of permissible foundation displacement which will undoubtedly depend on the type of structure involved.

40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{expected}} to alter the intensity and dynamics of <b>soil</b> <b>freezing</b> {{as a result of}} increased air temperatures and reduced snow cover. <b>Soil</b> <b>freezing</b> can influence ecosystem nitrogen (N) cycling by damaging plants and soil microorganisms, but little is known about how <b>soil</b> <b>freezing</b> effects on ecosystem N cycling may combine or interact with increased atmospheric N deposition, which is also expected to exert a strong influence on terrestrial ecosystems in the coming decades. The objective of my thesis was to examine the combined and possibly the interactive effects of climate induced changes in <b>soil</b> <b>freezing</b> and N addition on plant productivity, soil microorganisms, and soil nutrient cycling in a grass-dominated temperate old field ecosystem. First, using 15 N tracer, I investigated N retention by different nitrogen pools (plant, litter, roots, soil and simulated N deposition) in response to <b>soil</b> <b>freezing</b> under current and projected future atmospheric N deposition rates. My results indicated that <b>soil</b> <b>freezing</b> can increase N losses from soil over the winter and from atmospheric N deposition during the growing season, with the latter occurring due to decreased plant productivity. Second, I combined increased freezing (both in controlled environment chambers and in response to snow removal in the field) with N addition to explore whether <b>soil</b> <b>freezing</b> effects are mostly transient (i. e. over winter and spring melt), or whether there are legacy effects of freezing that continue over multiple years. My results indicated that the legacy effect of <b>soil</b> <b>freezing</b> reduced plant productivity over multiple years, but that N addition counteracted these declines in plant productivity. With respect to soil responses, freezing only caused short term (over winter) increases in extractable nitrogen pools, although there were also declines in fungal biomass during the second growing season as a legacy effect of freezing. Overall, my results indicate that intense <b>soil</b> <b>freezing</b> and increased atmospheric N deposition can both alter plant productivity and ecosystem N retention, although there were few significant interactions between these two factors...|$|E

Comparison of the simulated results by SHAW to the measured data showed that in the initial stage of freezing the simulated frozen depth was thinner than the measured; in the thawing period the simulated thawing rate was higher than the measured due to the overestimated soil temperature below 10 cm; however, for the most cold stage (the stable frozen stage), the simulated matched quite well with the measured. For the maximum frozen depth the simulation only overestimated by as much as 4 %. On the whole, the SHAW model performed satisfactorily. This provides a good base for further application of LSMs to the temperate desert ecosystem on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{changing}} climate {{may bring}} about more precipitation but less snowfall to Northeastern North America. A decreased snowpack may impact soil freeze-thaw cycles.

While a strong correlation is found linking total accumulated FDDs with <b>soil</b> <b>freezing</b> depths in areas free of snowpack, a better predictive tool is to relate <b>soil</b> <b>freezing</b> depth with the rate at which FDDs are accumulated (expressed as FDD/day). Accumulating FDDs at a rate of more than 4. 0 FDD/day resulted in a growing freezing depth, while accumulations of less than 4. 0 resulted in the thawing of the frozen soil.
