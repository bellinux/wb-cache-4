Business Consideration: Exchanges, Vendors and above all Clients have a common interest in ensuring that contract requirements for use of Exchange Information by Clients are simple, broadly consistent between Exchanges and interpreted in a broadly consistent manner by Vendors. Globally consistent <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Agreement</b> terms for Exchange Information would enable Clients to develop standard reporting and compliance systems, improving the efficiency and cutting the cost of market data administration for all parties.

40|$|Context With {{the rapidly}} growing demand for {{cellular}} networks’ capacityand coverage, effective planning of Network Infrastructure (NI) has been amajor challenge for the telecom operators. The mobility patterns of different subscriber groups in the networks {{have been found to}} be a crucialaspect in the planning of NI. For a telecom operator, it is important to havean estimate of the efficiency (in terms of the Network Capacity - numberof subscribers that the network can handle) of the existing NI. For thispurpose, Lundberg et. al., have developed an optimization based strategycalled as Tetris Strategy (TS), based on the <b>standard</b> <b>subscriber</b> groupingapproach called MOSAIC. The objective of TS is to calculate the upperbound estimate of the efficiency of the NI. Objectives The major objective of this thesis is to compare the efficiencyvalue of the NI when the subscribers are grouped (clustered) based on theirmobility patterns (characterized by a mobile trajectory) with the efficiencyvalue obtained when the subscribers are grouped based on the standardsubscriber grouping approach - MOSAIC. Methods Literature Review (LR) has been conducted to identify the stateof the art similarity/distance measures and algorithms to cluster trajectory data. Among the identified ones, for conducting experiments, LongestCommon Subsequences has been chosen as a similarity/distance measure,and Spectral and Agglomerative clustering algorithms have been chosen. All the experiments have been conducted on the subscriber trajectory dataprovided by the telecom operator, Telenor. The clusters obtained from theexperiments have been plugged into TS, to calculate the upper bound estimate of the efficiency of the NI. Results For the highest radio cell capacity, the network capacity valuesfor Spectral clustering, Agglomerative clustering and MOSAIC groupingsystem are 207234, 148056 and 87584 respectively. For every radio cellcapacity value, the mobility based clusters resulted in a higher network efficiency values than the MOSAIC. However, both spectral and agglomerativealgorithms have generated a very low quality clusters with the silhouettescores of 0. 0717 and 0. 0543 respectively. Conclusions Based on the analysis of the results, it can be concluded that,mobility based grouping of subscribers in the cellular network provide highernetwork efficiency values compared to the <b>standard</b> <b>subscriber</b> grouping systems such as MOSAIC...|$|R

40|$|A {{management}} <b>standard</b> {{for digital}} <b>subscriber</b> line (DSL) systems {{has been defined}} {{in order to ensure}} the spectral compatibility of the signals, services, and technologies that are deployed. Compatibility is typically accomplished by using static spectral masks. This conservative approach may lead to suboptimal performance of DSL systems. Recently, a number of dynamic spectrum management (DSM) solutions were proposed that improve DSL performance by adaptive application of spectral masks, also known as DSM level 2. The masks are calculated taking into account actual performance requirements and impairments, such as crosstalk. We present improved DSM level 2 algorithms that are faster than existing algorithms and demonstrate potential rate/reach gains by numerical simulations for some DSL technologies, such as asymmetric digital subscriber line transceivers. We also present a solution for flexible deployment of DSM spectrum optimization algorithms in the field. 18 page(s...|$|R

40|$|A {{heuristic}} optimal discrete {{bit allocation}} {{algorithm is proposed}} for solving the margin maximization problem in discrete multitone (DMT) systems. Starting from an initial equal power assignment bit distribution, the proposed algorithm employs a multistaged bit rate allocation scheme to meet the target rate. If the total bit rate {{is far from the}} target rate, a multiple-bits loading procedure is used to obtain a bit allocation close to the target rate. When close to the target rate, a parallel bit-loading procedure is used to achieve the target rate and this is computationally more efficient than conventional greedy bit-loading algorithm. Finally, the target bit rate distribution is checked, if it is efficient, then it is also the optimal solution; else, optimal bit distribution can be obtained only by few bit swaps. Simulation results using the <b>standard</b> asymmetric digital <b>subscriber</b> line (ADSL) test loops show that the proposed algorithm is efficient for practical DMT transmissions. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} initiatives {{addressed in}} this thesis are geared towards improving the performance of passive optical networks {{through the development of}} advanced dynamic bandwidth allocation protocols. In particular, the aim of the research undertaken is to enhance the quality of service offered by standard passive optical networks with reduced network costs. To that extent, a dynamic multi-wavelength protocol has been developed to increase the network upstream bandwidth and introduce multiple service levels to a fibre to the home-based giga-bit passive optical network. Simulation results have confirmed the reduction of the mean packet delay by adjusting the ITU-T standard G 984 giga-bit passive optical network frame format by means of the introduction of extended wavelength band overlay based on the ITU-T Coarse- Wavelength Division Multiplexing grid to support the multi-wavelength functionality. To evaluate the multi-wavelength upstream operation of the newly implemented models in OPNET, 2 -dimensional Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation algorithms have been introduced to manage the network resources in both the time and wavelength domains. Furthermore, the enhanced traffic allocation among the supported wavelengths in new protocol confirmed a performance improvement in the network total capacity and the mean packet delay, which demonstrates the network reliability and improves the quality of the provided service according to the <b>subscriber</b> service level <b>agreement,</b> with a minimum guaranteed bandwidth of 100 Mbit/s to fulfil applications and associated bandwidth requirements for the next generation access network.
