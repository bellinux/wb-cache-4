The method takes advantages of both continuous and microscopic simulation approaches. As {{a result of the}} combination of two different numerical methods, such as, large particles and direct Monte Carlo simulation, the model describes high-rate laser ablation {{for a wide range of}} background pressures (from zero to hundreds Pa). The model is used to investigate laser plume interaction with background gases. Particularly, the plume–gas mixing and energy exchange are taken into account. The dynamics of the laser plume expansion is investigated. <b>Snowplow</b> <b>effect</b> is observed at sufficiently high pressures. At smaller pressures, strong plume–gas mixing takes place near the contact surface. The simulation results explain experimentally obtained spatial maps of the reaction products formed during the plume expansion into a reactive background gas...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{systematic}} {{study of the}} Schottky barrier lowering induced by dopant segregation during nickel germanidation at NiGe/n-Ge(100) contacts. We used two different doping ions (As/P) and prepared two different NiGe layer thicknesses (30 nm/ 60 nm) at 400 degrees C. NiGe was found to exhibit a smooth interface to the Ge substrate and a very low specific resistance of 15. 1 mu Omega cm. Both doping species, As and P, segregated at the NiGe/Ge interface during germanidation due to the <b>snowplow</b> <b>effect.</b> We found the concentration of dopants at the NiGe/Ge interface increases with increasing implantation dose. From low-temperature measurements, significant lowering of the effective Schottky-barrier height from 0. 72 eV at 0 K for diodes without ion implantation to 0. 38 eV by P segregration was determined. With a value of only 0. 19 eV, arsenic {{was found to be}} superior to P for Schottky barrier lowering. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{properties of}} the amplitude-modulated circularly polarized Alfven wave are studied for beta less than one. The temporal behavior of the wave packet of the electromagnetic hybrid simulation is compared with a numerical solution of the derivative nonlinear Schroedinger (DNLS) equation. It is shown that the left-hand-polarized mode evolves into a shocklike structure due to the modulational instability. However, both cyclotron damping and a <b>snowplow</b> <b>effect</b> near the steepened wave packet suppress its further steepening, contrary to the predictions of the DNLS equation. For the right-hand mode, formation of the shock does not take place, and the initial time development is well described by the DNLS equation. The daughter Alfven wave and ion acoustic waves are excited due to the decay instability at a later time. Heating or acceleration of the particles takes place for both left- and right-hand waves. Energy transfer from the wave to the particles occurs effectively when substantial modulation in the wave amplitude is present...|$|E
40|$|We have tracked a slow {{magnetic}} cloud associated coronal mass ejection (CME) continuously {{from its}} origin as a flux rope {{structure in the}} low solar corona over a four-day passage to impact with spacecraft located near Earth. Combining measurements from the STEREO, ACE, and Wind space missions, {{we are able to}} follow major elements with enough specificity to relate pre-CME coronal structure in the low corona to the corresponding elements seen in the near-Earth in situ data. Combining extreme ultraviolet imaging, quantitative Thomson scattering data throughout the flight of the CME, and “ground-truth ” in situ measurements, we: (1) identify the plasma observed by ACE and Wind with specific features in the solar corona (a segment of a long flux rope); (2) determine the onset mechanism of the CME (destabilization of a filament channel following flare reconnection, coupled with the mass draining instability) and demonstrate that it is consistent with the in situ measurements; (3) identify the origin of different layers of the sheath material around the central magnetic cloud (closed field lifted {{from the base of the}} corona, closed field entrained during passage through the corona, and solar wind entrained by the front of the CME); (4) measure mass accretion of the system via <b>snowplow</b> <b>effects</b> in the solar wind as the CME crossed the solar system; and (5) quantify the kinetic energy budget of the system in interplanetary space, and determine that it is consistent with no long-term driving force on the CME...|$|R

The first reported planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) images depicting the relative ground-state, neutral density of Si within a pulsed laser ablation (PLA) plume as it expands into vacuum and 10 mTorr Ar are presented. Because {{of the high}} flow speeds in PLA plumes and the narrow bandwidth of typical lasers, several images acquired with the laser detuned incrementally must be superimposed to produce images which compensate for Doppler shifts. Density profiles of Si along the axis of symmetry as a plume expands into Ar at pressures of 0 - 150 mTorr demonstrate {{the influence of a}} background gas and substrate on the expanding plume in the interval 0 < t < 5 [mu]s. In-flight production of SiO along the contact as an Si plume expands into 1. 0 Torr air is demonstrated in the first reported images of a reactive intermediate species produced during PLA. The expansion of Si into both 10 mTorr and 100 mTorr Ar is investigated using the technique of Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC), with a simple ablation model used to generate the Si plume. As a consequence of the rapid displacement of background gas, i. e. the <b>snowplow</b> <b>effect,</b> the plume divides into two components, one which travels nearly collisionlessly toward the substrate and one which interacts more strongly with the gas. At 10 mTorr, collisions between fast component Si atoms and Ar atoms during the period t < 250 ns are responsible for most of the energy transfer from Si to Ar. This results {{in the creation of a}} fast (15 eV), collisionless Ar component which impacts the substrate shortly after the fast Si component arrives, but does not result in thermal heating. At 100 mTorr, the energy transfer from the plume to the Ar gas occurs on a [mu]s time scale and is attributed primarily to thermal heating. The energy of the fast Ar component decreases to about 5 eV. Finally, the DSMC technique is employed to study the expansion of Si into both 10 mTorr and 100 mTorr O 2. The chemical reaction [ [...] . ] is investigated, including rotational and vibrational excitation the diatomic molecules O 2 and SiO. At both pressures, SiO first appears along the sides of the expanding plume and, at 100 mTorr, appears only along the contact front between the Si and O 2. This result compares well will PLIF data. An examination of the O 2 rotational temperature indicates that the background gas is heated along a conical surface whose tip is located at the ablation spot as the plume expands. Collectively, these simulations demonstrate the potential of the DSMC method to provide quantitative information about the reactive expansion of a wide variety of PLA plumes into rarified background gas mixtures, and study the particle flux onto a substrate when parameters such as background gas pressure and composition are varied...|$|E
