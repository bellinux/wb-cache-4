5|$|An {{alternative}} approach to designing smaller waveguide filters {{was provided by}} the use of non-propagating evanescent modes. Jaynes and Edson proposed evanescent mode waveguide filters in the late 1950s. Methods for designing these filters were created by Craven and Young in 1966. Since then, evanescent mode waveguide filters have seen successful use where waveguide <b>size</b> <b>or</b> weight are important considerations.|$|E
5|$|Some large {{satellites}} are {{of similar}} <b>size</b> <b>or</b> {{larger than the}} planet Mercury, e.g. Jupiter's Galilean moons and Titan. Alan Stern has argued that location should not matter and that only geophysical attributes {{should be taken into}} account in the definition of a planet, and proposes the term satellite planet for a planet-sized satellite. Likewise, dwarf planets in the asteroid belt and Kuiper belt should be considered planets according to Stern.|$|E

5|$|Tires {{have a large}} {{influence}} over bike handling, especially on motorcycles, but also on bicycles. Tires influence bike dynamics in two distinct ways: finite crown radius and force generation.

Increasing the crown radius of the rear tire has the opposite effect, but to a lesser degree.|$|E
5|$|Viewed from Earth, the Moon is just {{far enough}} away to have almost the same apparent-sized disk as the Sun. The angular <b>size</b> (<b>or</b> solid angle) of these two bodies match because, {{although}} the Sun's diameter is about 400 times {{as large as the}} Moon's, it is also 400 times more distant. This allows total and annular solar eclipses to occur on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Aerial robots must be {{unmanned}} and autonomous, {{and must}} compete {{based on their}} ability to sense the semi-structured environment of the competition arena. They may be intelligent or preprogrammed, but they must not be controlled by a remote human operator. Computational power need not be carried on the air vehicle itself. Computers operating from standard commercial power may be set up outside the competition arena boundary and uni- or bi-directional data may be transmitted to/from the vehicles in the arena. <b>Size</b> <b>or</b> weight constraints are normally placed on the aerial robots, which must be equipped with a method of manually activated remote override of the primary propulsion system.|$|E

5|$|As {{many as half}} of all Cavalier King Charles Spaniels {{may have}} a {{congenital}} blood disorder called idiopathic asymptomatic thrombocytopenia, an abnormally low number of platelets in the blood, according to recent studies in Denmark and the United States. Platelets, or thrombocytes, are disk-shaped blood elements which aid in blood clotting. Excessively low numbers {{are the most common}} cause of bleeding disorders in dogs. The platelets in the blood of many Cavalier King Charles Spaniels are a combination of those of normal size for dogs and others that are abnormally oversized, or macrothrombocytes. Macrothrombocytosis also is a congenital abnormality found in at least a third of CKCSs. These large platelets function normally, and the typical Cavalier does not appear to experience any health problems due to either the <b>size</b> <b>or</b> fewer numbers of its platelets.|$|E

The airline is based in Waterside near its main hub at London Heathrow Airport. In January 2011 BA merged with Iberia, creating the International Airlines Group (IAG), a holding company registered in Madrid, Spain.

5|$|Combined Emergency Service – {{these are}} full service {{emergency}} service agencies, {{which may be}} found in places such as airports or large colleges and universities. Their key feature is that all personnel are trained not only in ambulance (EMT) care, but as a firefighter and a peace officer (police function). They {{may be found in}} smaller towns and cities, where <b>size</b> <b>or</b> budget does not warrant separate services. This multi-functionality allows {{to make the most of}} limited resource or budget, but having a single team respond to any emergency.|$|E

5|$|Historically {{a part of}} Lancashire, Milnrow {{during the}} Middle Ages was a hamlet located within the {{township}} of Butterworth and parish of Rochdale. It was named by the Anglo-Saxons, but the Norman conquest of England resulted in its ownership by minor Norman families, such as the Schofields and Cleggs. In the 15th century, the descendants of these families successfully agitated for a chapel of ease to be constructed in Milnrow by {{the banks of the}} River Beal, triggering its development as the main settlement in Butterworth. Despite this distinction, Milnrow did not increase much further in <b>size</b> <b>or</b> population until the dawn of the woollen trade in the Late Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|IQ classifications for {{individuals}} also vary because category labels for IQ score ranges {{are specific to}} each brand of test. The test publishers {{do not have a}} uniform practice of labeling IQ score ranges, nor do they have a consistent practice of dividing up IQ score ranges into categories of the same <b>size</b> <b>or</b> with the same boundary scores. Thus psychologists should specify which test was given when reporting a test-taker's IQ. Psychologists and IQ test authors recommend that psychologists adopt the terminology of each test publisher when reporting IQ score ranges.|$|E

50|$|<b>Size</b> zero <b>or</b> <b>size</b> 0 is a women's {{clothing}} {{size in the}} US catalog sizes system. Size 0 and 00 {{were invented}} due to the changing of clothing sizes over time (referred to as vanity <b>sizing</b> <b>or</b> <b>size</b> inflation), which has caused the adoption of lower numbers. For example, a 2011 size 0 is equivalent to a 2001 size 2, and is larger than a 1970 <b>size</b> 6 <b>or</b> 1958 <b>size</b> 8. Modern size 0 clothing, depending on brand and style, fits measurements of chest-stomach-hips from 30-22-32 inches (76-56-81 cm) to 33-25-35 inches (84-64-89 cm). Size 00 can be anywhere from 0.5 to 2 inches (1 to 5 cm) smaller than size 0. Size zero often refers to extremely thin individuals (especially women and adolescent girls), or trends associated with them.|$|R
5|$|Mist is {{responsible}} for the existence of 'magicite', stones that contain magical powers due to the presence of Mist in their crystalline structure. Magicite is divided into three types; spellstones that are used in spell casting, skystones that are installed into a component known as 'glossair rings' that give flight to the vehicles, whether small-sized bikes or large airships, and memstones that function much like recording devices. The quality of magicite depends on the quantity of Mist and not on the <b>size</b> <b>or</b> shape of the stone. The ubiquitousness of magic and magicite, as well as its cost-efficiency, led to it replacing electricity and its various sources as the dominant usable energy in Ivalice.|$|E
5|$|New Melones was {{the focus}} of a long {{environmental}} battle during the 1970s and early 1980s; critics protested the flooding of a long scenic stretch of the Stanislaus River, which flowed over whitewater rapids through the deepest limestone canyon in the western United States. The protestors employed a variety of methods, some extreme, to prevent the filling of New Melones Lake until 1983, when record-setting floods filled the reservoir and nearly breached the dam's emergency spillway. The fight over New Melones galvanized the river conservation movement in California and influenced major water policy changes on the state and federal levels; since its completion, no other dams of its <b>size</b> <b>or</b> importance have been built in the United States.|$|E
5|$|No {{discernible}} {{variation in}} <b>size</b> <b>or</b> appearance in green and golden bell frogs between different geographic areas is found. Fluctuations {{in size and}} appearance between different populations are outweighed by variations within the populations themselves. Females {{are more likely to}} be found away from breeding sites, while the opposite applies for males. Metamorphlings are divided in roughly equal numbers between males and females, while juvenile frogs are observed less often than their mature counterparts, although scientists are not sure whether this is due to lower abundance or increased reclusiveness.|$|E

5|$|One {{hypothesis}} is formation by the gravitational instability. Particles several centimeters in <b>size</b> <b>or</b> larger slowly settle {{near the middle}} plane of the disk, forming a very thin—less than 100km—and dense layer. This layer is gravitationally unstable and may fragment into numerous clumps, which in turn collapse into planetesimals. However, the differing velocities of the gas disk and the solids near the mid-plane can generate turbulence which prevents the layer from becoming thin enough to fragment due to gravitational instability. This may limit the formation of planetesimals via gravitational instabilities to specific locations in the disk where the concentration of solids is enhanced.|$|E
5|$|Parasitoids {{have been}} found to parasitize B. rufimanus eggs: Chremylus rubiginosus and Triaspis thoracicus (family: Braconidae), and Dinarmus acutus (family: Pteromalidae). Their larvae develop into B. rufimanus larvae and adults emerge from the seed, leaving a small {{emergence}} hole in the seed (smaller than for B. rufimanus). Generalist predators on faba bean leaves such as spiders might feed on B. rufimanus eggs and contribute to their biological control although no data was found on their potential impact on the population <b>size</b> <b>or</b> growth.|$|E
