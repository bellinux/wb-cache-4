5|$|After the {{contestant}} decides {{for which}} amount to play, the prize money is {{displayed on the}} gameboard. The contestant and chaser are presented with the same multiple choice question, and each locks in their answer, which cannot then be changed; the other has five seconds to answer after them, otherwise they are locked out and do not advance on the gameboard. For each question the contestant answers correctly, the prize money shown on the gameboard moves one <b>step</b> <b>closer</b> to the team bank. Similarly, the chaser moves one <b>step</b> <b>closer</b> to the contestant's prize money with each correct answer. Further questions are asked until the contestant reaches {{the end of the}} board (thus banking the prize money), or the chaser catches the contestant, eliminating them from the game. No movement is made by the contestant or the chaser if an incorrect answer is provided or if they are locked out by the time limit.|$|E
5|$|Hughes faced BJ Penn on November 20, 2010, in {{a rubber}} match at , after their {{previous}} two fights at UFC 46 and UFC 63. Penn came out {{strong in the}} first few seconds of the opening round, catching one of Hughes' kicks and knocking him off balance with a counter hook. Penn then connected with an overhand right that dropped Hughes, following up with three clean shots to the jaw. The bout was ended at 21 seconds into the first round, with Hughes trilogy against Penn ending at 1-2. The fight marked the first time Hughes had been knocked out (he had previously lost via technical knockout). Post-fight Hughes hinted that the loss moved him one <b>step</b> <b>closer</b> to retirement.|$|E
5|$|In 1784, {{he founded}} the Bank of New York which {{became one of the}} longest {{operating}} banks in American history, it stayed in business for over 220 years before it merged with another bank in 2007. Hamilton was {{one of the men who}} restored King's College, which had been suspended since 1776 and severely damaged during the War, as Columbia College. Long dissatisfied with the weak Articles of Confederation, he played a major leadership role at the Annapolis Convention in 1786. He drafted its resolution for a constitutional convention, and in doing so brought his longtime desire to have a more powerful, more financially independent federal government one <b>step</b> <b>closer</b> to reality.|$|E

5|$|O'Sullivan {{did not win}} any ranking titles {{during the}} 1994/1995 season, but reached two finals. He lost to James Wattana in {{the final of the}} Thailand Open and to John Higgins in the final of the British Open. At the Masters, O'Sullivan {{captured}} his first title by defeating Higgins 9–3 in the final. With this victory, he became the youngest player ever to win the tournament at the age of 19 years and 69 days. and came a <b>step</b> <b>closer</b> to collecting all the Triple Crown events, only requiring a world title to complete his collection. At the World Championship, he recorded his furthest run yet by reaching the quarter-finals, where he lost 8–13 to Stephen Hendry.|$|E
5|$|The goal of elucidating {{pathophysiology}} {{has also}} led to increased interest in the association between risk-SNPs and the gene expression of nearby genes, the so-called expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies. The reason is that GWAS studies identify risk-SNPs, but not risk-genes, and specification of genes is one <b>step</b> <b>closer</b> towards actionable drug targets. As a result, major GWA studies by 2011 typically included extensive eQTL analysis. One of the strongest eQTL effects observed for a GWA-identified risk SNP is the SORT1 locus. Functional follow up studies of this locus using small interfering RNA and gene knock-out mice have {{shed light on the}} metabolism of low-density lipoproteins, which have important clinical implications for cardiovascular disease.|$|E

25|$|In geometry, a quasiregular {{polyhedron}} is a semiregular polyhedron {{that has}} exactly {{two kinds of}} regular faces, which alternate around each vertex. They are edge-transitive and hence a <b>step</b> <b>closer</b> to regular polyhedra than the semiregular which are merely vertex-transitive. The dual figures is also sometimes considered quasiregular, except that they are edge-transitive, face-transitive, and alternate between two regular vertex figures.|$|E

25|$|The Indianapolis Colts {{were now}} one <b>step</b> <b>closer</b> to perfection, as {{they only had}} only four games left to match the record set by the 1972 Miami Dolphins for most {{consecutive}} wins to begin a season. Colts quarterback Peyton Manning picked apart the Jacksonville secondary all game, finishing the game with 24 of 36 for 324 yards passing and two touchdowns, while being sacked a season-high 3 times. Jaguars QB David Garrard (who was starting {{in the place of}} Byron Leftwich) was 26 of 35 for 250 passing yards, and had one touchdown. Also of note: the Colts snapped the Jaguars' five-game winning streak.|$|E
25|$|Zoroaster {{emphasized}} {{the freedom of}} the individual to choose right or wrong and individual responsibility for one's deeds. This personal choice to accept aša, or arta (the divine order), and shun druj (ignorance and chaos) is one's own decision and not a dictate of Ahura Mazda. For Zarathustra, by thinking good thoughts, saying good words, and doing good deeds (e.g. assisting the needy or doing good works) we increase this divine force aša or arta in the world and in ourselves, celebrate the divine order, and we come a <b>step</b> <b>closer</b> on the everlasting road to being one with the Creator. Thus, we are not the slaves or servants of Ahura Mazda, but we can make a personal choice to be his co-workers, thereby refreshing the world and ourselves.|$|E
25|$|The {{human genome}} is the genome of Homo sapiens, which is stored on 23 {{chromosome}} pairs. Whereas a genome sequence lists {{the order of}} every DNA base in a genome, a genome map identifies the landmarks. A genome map is less detailed than a genome sequence and aids in navigating around the genome. While working at the National Institute of Health, Craig Venter discovered a technique for rapidly identifying all of the mRNAs present in a cell, and began {{to use it to}} identify human brain genes. The short cDNA sequence fragments discovered by this method are called expressed sequence tags. Through his scientific research of bringing the world one <b>step</b> <b>closer</b> to personalized medicine, Craig Venter was listed on Time Magazine's 2007 and 2008 Time 100 list of the most influential people in the world.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{newspaper}} report, Scotland Yard announced the same day that they had arrested Majeed on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud bookmakers. Two days later, after the Test match had been completed, three more arrests were made (two unidentified men and an unidentified woman) on suspicion of money laundering in connection with the allegations. Police also seized the cell phones of Asif, Amir, and Salman Butt as part of their investigations. Scotland Yard announced on 17 September, 2010 that the initial file of the investigation had been passed on to the Crown Prosecution Service for them to decide whether to charge the players or not. On 5 November, 2010 Scotland Yard announced that they had passed on the second file of fixing evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service. This moved the case one <b>step</b> <b>closer</b> to the courts.|$|E
25|$|The {{taxonomy}} set out by Bouchet & Rocroi is {{an attempt}} to get one <b>step</b> <b>closer</b> to representing this part of the evolutionary history of the phylum Mollusca. Bouchet & Rocroi's classification system is a hybrid of the pre-existing, more traditional Linnaean taxonomy along with some more recent far-reaching revisions which are based on molecular work and use clades as taxa, (see cladistics). In the past, the taxonomy of gastropods was largely based on the morphological characters of the taxa, such as the shell characteristics (including the protoconch) in shelled species, and the internal anatomy, including the structure of the radula and details of the reproductive system. Recent advances are based more on the molecular characteristics of the DNA and RNA. This shift in emphasis has meant that the newer taxa and their hierarchy are subject to debate, a debate that {{is not likely to be}} resolved soon.|$|E
25|$|The dispute centres {{around the}} Parthenon Marbles removed by Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin, from 1801 to 1803, {{which are in}} the British Museum. A few sculptures from the Parthenon {{are also in the}} Louvre in Paris, in Copenhagen, and elsewhere, but more than half are in the Acropolis Museum in Athens. A few can still be seen on the {{building}} itself. The Greek government has campaigned since 1983 for the British Museum to return the sculptures to Greece. The British Museum has steadfastly refused to return the sculptures, and successive British governments have been unwilling to force the Museum to do so (which would require legislation). Nevertheless, talks between senior representatives from Greek and British cultural ministries and their legal advisors took place in London on 4 May 2007. These were the first serious negotiations for several years, and there were hopes that the two sides may move a <b>step</b> <b>closer</b> to a resolution.|$|E
