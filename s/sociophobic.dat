It contains five scales on current symptoms: depressive, vegetative, agoraphobic, and <b>sociophobic</b> symptoms and pain; a global severity index (GSI- 27); a lifetime assessment for depressive symptoms; and a screening question for suicidality...|$|E
40|$|The horror film soundtrack is {{a complex}} web of narratological, ethnographic, and semiological factors all related to the social {{tensions}} intimated by a film. This study examines four major periods in the zombie's film career [...] the Voodoo zombie of the 1930 s and 1940 s, the invasion narratives of the late 1960 s, the post-apocalyptic survivalist fantasies of the 1970 s and 1980 s, and the modern post- 9 / 11 zombie [...] to track how certain musical sounds and styles are indexed with the content of zombie films. Two main musical threads link the individual films' characterization of the zombie and the setting: Othering via different types of musical exoticism, {{and the use of}} sonic excess to pronounce <b>sociophobic</b> themes...|$|E
40|$|Background: The symptom {{checklist}} SCL- 27 -plus is a short, multidimensional screening {{instrument for}} mental health problems. It contains five scales on current symptoms: depressive, vegetative, agoraphobic, and <b>sociophobic</b> symptoms and pain; a global severity index (GSI- 27); a lifetime assessment for depressive symptoms; and a screening question for suicidality. Method: A reformulated version of screening items constituted a survey of n= 374 students. Therefore, a total of 76 items was formulated and presented to the students within a questionnaire booklet, that could be filled out at home. Results: All scales of the SCL- 27 -plus showed good to satisfactory reliability (i. e.. 90 ≥ Cronbach’s a ≥. 70). The distributions of the scales were less skewed than in older versions of the symptom checklists and scale inter-correlations were lower. The scale “symptoms of mistrust” could not be retained. Conclusion: The SCL- 27 -plus demonstrates a clear improvement over the SCL- 27. Test-statistical properties were improved. In addition, the supplementation by a lifetime scale for depression and a screener for suicidality shall help the clinician {{as well as the}} epidemiologist...|$|E
