Occasionally, Meckel's diverticulitis may present {{with all the}} features of acute appendicitis. Also, severe pain in the epigastric region is experienced by the patient along with bloating in the epigastric and umbilical regions. At times, the symptoms are <b>so</b> <b>painful</b> that they may cause sleepless nights with acute pain felt in the foregut region, specifically in the epigastric and umbilical regions.|$|E

At one point, the illness became <b>so</b> <b>painful</b> that he was bedridden for a few days; filming was then restricted to second unit work, some of which was done by Mario Bava. Argento has called Inferno one of his least favorite of all his films...as his memories of the movie are tainted by his recollection of the painful illness he suffered.|$|E
500|$|At {{the request}} of Paris, Houphouet-Boigny began forging {{relations}} with South Africa in October 1970, justifying his attitude by stating that [...] "he problems of racial discrimination, <b>so</b> <b>painful,</b> so distressing, so revolting to our dignity of Negros, must not be resolved, we believe, by force." [...] He even proposed to the OAU in June 1971 that they follow his lead. In spite of receiving some support, his proposal was rejected. This refusal did not, however, prevent him from continuing his attempts to approach the Pretoria regime. His attempts bore fruit in October of that year, when a semi-official meeting between a delegation of high level Ivorian officials and South African Prime Minister B. J. Vorster {{was held in the}} capital of South Africa. Moreover, mindful of the Communist influence in Africa, he met Vorster in Geneva in 1977, after the Soviet Union and Cuba tried to collectively spread their influence in Angola and Ethiopia. Relations with South Africa continued on an official basis until the end of his presidency.|$|E

500|$|An 1878 {{incident}} {{illustrates the}} strong feelings {{that can be}} aroused in susceptible readers of newspaper columns. Prus had criticized the rowdy behavior of some Warsaw university students at a lecture about the poet Wincenty Pol. The students demanded that Prus retract what he had written. [...] He refused, and on 26 March 1878 several of them surrounded him outside his home, where he had returned shortly before in the company (for his safety) of two fellow writers; one of the students, Jan Sawicki, slapped Prus' face. Police were summoned, but Prus declined to press charges. [...] Seventeen years later, during his 1895 visit to Paris, Prus' memory of the incident was still <b>so</b> <b>painful</b> {{that he may have}} refused (accounts vary) to meet with one of his assailants, Kazimierz Dłuski, and his wife Bronisława Dłuska (Marie Skłodowska Curie's sister who 19 years later, in 1914, would scold Joseph Conrad for writing his novels and stories in English, rather than in Polish for the benefit of Polish culture). [...] These curiously interlinked incidents involving the Dłuskis and the two authors perhaps illustrate the contemporary intensity of aggrieved Polish national pride.|$|E
500|$|Als called Angelou {{one of the}} [...] "pioneers of self-exposure", {{willing to}} focus {{honestly}} on the more negative aspects of her personality and choices. [...] For example, while Angelou was composing her second autobiography, Gather Together in My Name, she was concerned about how her readers would react to her disclosure {{that she had been}} a prostitute. [...] Her husband Paul Du Feu talked her into publishing the book by encouraging her to [...] "tell the truth as a writer" [...] and to [...] "be honest about it". [...] "Song" [...] took 16 years to write because it was <b>so</b> <b>painful</b> for her to relive the events she described, including the assassinations of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr. [...] She did not celebrate her birthday, April 4, for many years because it was also the anniversary of King's death, choosing instead to send his widow Coretta Scott King flowers. [...] Although Song was considered the final installment in her series of autobiographies, Angelou continued writing about her life story through essays, and at the age of 85, published her seventh autobiography Mom & Me & Mom (2013), which focused on her relationship with her mother. [...] The spoken word album based on Song and narrated by Angelou received a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album in 2003.|$|E
500|$|In an April 21, 1975, {{letter to}} Pinochet, Friedman {{considered}} the [...] "key economic problems of Chile are clearly... inflation {{and the promotion}} of a healthy social market economy". He stated that [...] "There is only one way to end inflation: by drastically reducing the rate of increase of the quantity of money..." [...] and that [...] "...cutting government spending is by far and away the most desirable way to reduce the fiscal deficit, because it... strengthens the private sector thereby laying the foundations for healthy economic growth". As to how rapidly inflation should be ended, Friedman felt that [...] "for Chile where inflation is raging at 10–20% a month... gradualism is not feasible. It would involve <b>so</b> <b>painful</b> an operation over so long a period that the patient would not survive." [...] Choosing [...] "a brief period of higher unemployment..." [...] was the lesser evil.. and that [...] "the experience of Germany,... of Brazil..., of the post-war adjustment in the U.S.... all argue for shock treatment". In the letter Friedman recommended to deliver the shock approach with [...] "...a package to eliminate the surprise and to relieve acute distress" [...] and [...] "...for definiteness let me sketch the contents of a package proposal... to be taken as illustrative" [...] although his knowledge of Chile was [...] "too limited to enable [...] to be precise or comprehensive". He listed a [...] "sample proposal" [...] of 8 monetary and fiscal measures including [...] "the removal of as many as obstacles as possible that now hinder the private market. For example, suspend... the present law against discharging employees". He closed, stating [...] "Such a shock program could end inflation in months". His letter suggested that cutting spending to reduce the fiscal deficit would result in less transitional unemployment than raising taxes.|$|E

Moreover, the royal treasury was severely being depleted to pay the British one million pounds sterling (about $2 billion in 2006 US dollars) as war reparations in four installations.

During their love-making this time, Abe put the knife {{to the base}} of Ishida's penis, and said she would make sure he would never play around with another woman. Ishida laughed at this. Two nights into this bout of sex, Abe began choking Ishida, and he told her to continue, saying that this increased his pleasure. She had him do it to her as well. On the evening of May 16, 1936, Abe used her obi sash to cut off Ishida's breathing during orgasm, and they both enjoyed it. They repeated this for two more hours. Once Abe stopped the strangulation, Ishida's face became distorted, and would not return to its normal appearance. Ishida took 30 tablets of a sedative called Calmotin to try to soothe his pain. According to Abe, as Ishida started to doze, he told her, [...] "You'll put the cord around my neck and squeeze it again while I'm sleeping, won't you... If you start to strangle me, don't stop, because it is <b>so</b> <b>painful</b> afterward." [...] Abe commented that she wondered if he had wanted her to kill him, but on reflection decided he must have been joking.|$|E
2500|$|In 1985, Warwick {{recorded}} the American Foundation for AIDS Research (AmFAR) benefit single [...] "That's What Friends Are For" [...] alongside Gladys Knight, Elton John and Stevie Wonder. The single, credited to [...] "Dionne and Friends", {{was released in}} October and eventually raised over three million dollars for that cause. The tune was a triple #1 — R, Adult Contemporary, and four weeks at the summit on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1986 — selling close to two million 45s in the United States alone. [...] "Working against AIDS, especially after years of raising money for work on many blood-related diseases such as sickle-cell anemia, seemed {{the right thing to}} do. You have to be granite not to want to help people with AIDS, because the devastation that it causes is <b>so</b> <b>painful</b> to see. I was so hurt to see my friend die with such agony," [...] Warwick told the Washington Post in 1988. [...] "I am tired of hurting and it does hurt." [...] The single won the performers the NARAS Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, as well as Song of the Year for its writers, Bacharach and Bayer Sager. It also was ranked by Billboard magazine as the most popular song of 1986. With this single Warwick also released her most successful album of the 1980s, titled Friends, which reached #12 on Billboard's album chart.|$|E
2500|$|Madame Tadolini, who, for {{the first}} time is about to appear in London, I am sure will become a great favorite, as she {{possesses}} all qualities necessary to captivate an English audience. She is inclined to , but she is very handsome on the stage, with dangerous eyes—the whitest shoulder in the world—and a sense of enjoyment in her acting, which your audience {{will not be able to}} resist. Tadolini's voice is a clear soprano-mezzo-soprano in its richest quality, with an intonation that approaches, when necessary, to the contralto. It is as clear as a bell, round, full, and sonorous, perfectly flexible and capable of all those modulations which a great artist like her dashes off, but which are <b>so</b> <b>painful</b> and difficult to thinner voices, and less qualified science. I heard the prima donna to great disadvantage, as she disdained to sing to an empty house (from political excitement), and used merely one half of her powers. Her acting was equally restrained, but the inward spirit could not be altogether subdued, and she occasionally broke forth into silvery and impassioned notes, and abandoned herself to that natural gaiety of song that rendered her in the scene the most captivating of coquettes. Had Tadolini known that the Times has ears everywhere, she might have exerted herself to please them; but criticism has art and judgment, and though she sung at mezzo voce, it was not difficult to prognosticate complete success for her at Her Majesty's Theatre.|$|E

2500|$|There Buechner {{realized}} {{the challenge of}} writing without the structure of school life around him. He describes the creation of his next novel, The Entrance to Porlock, as follows: [...] "...the labor of writing which was <b>so</b> <b>painful</b> that I find it hard, even now, to see beyond {{the memory of the}} pain to whatever merit it may have." [...] However, in 1968, Buechner received a letter from Charles Price, the chaplain at Harvard, inviting him to give the Noble Lectures series in the winter of 1969. His predecessors in this role were none other than Richard Niebuhr and George Buttrick, and Buechner was both flattered and daunted by the idea of joining so august a group. When he voiced his concerns, Price replied that he should write [...] "something in the area of [...] "religion and letters."" [...] Thence came the idea to write about the everyday events of life [...] "as the alphabet through which God, of his grace, spells out his words, his meaning, to us. So The Alphabet of Grace was the title I hit upon, and what I set out to do was to try to describe a single representative day of my life in a way to suggest what there was of God to hear in it." [...] This process showed Buechner {{a way out of the}} frustration he had felt while writing The Entrance to Porlock: by drawing on his own experience, he found the means to convey his thoughts through his writing.|$|E
2500|$|La Russa {{says it is}} {{important}} that relievers know their roles and the situations which they will be called into a game. He added, [...] "Sure, games can get away from you in the seventh and eighth, but those last three outs in the ninth are the toughest. You want the guy who can handle that pressure. That, to me, is most important." [...] Oakland general manager Billy Beane said there would be too much media criticism if a pitcher other than the closer lost the game in the ninth." [...] Managerial moves are immediately questioned with millions of fans having access to ESPN, the MLB Network, and other cable channels. Former manager Jim Fregosi said managers do not like to be second-guessed. [...] "Even if you know the odds, it's more comfortable being wrong {{when you go to the}} closer", said Beane. [...] He noted the incremental increase gained by a closer in a three-run save situation [...] "is worth it because losing is <b>so</b> <b>painful</b> in that situation." [...] Baseball announcer Chris Wheeler noted that there is pressure on managers to pitch closers in the ninth inning when they were paid big money to pitch in that role. Former general manager Pat Gillick said closers become one-inning pitchers as managers began copying the practice of having setup pitchers enter before closers. [...] "There are just too many specialists, guys who can only pitch one inning and only pitch certain innings and throw only 20 pitches. I think most pitchers are capable of pitching more", said Gillick.|$|E
