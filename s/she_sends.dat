5|$|The {{expansion}} {{to three}} films allowed much more creative freedom, although Jackson, Walsh, and Boyens had to restructure their script accordingly. The three films do not correspond exactly to the trilogy's three volumes, but rather represent a three-part adaptation. Jackson takes a more chronological {{approach to the}} story than did Tolkien. Frodo's quest is the main focus, and Aragorn is the main sub-plot, and many sequences (such as Tom Bombadil) that do not contribute directly to those two plots were left out. Much effort was put into creating satisfactory conclusions and making sure exposition did not bog down the pacing. Amongst new sequences, there are also expansions on elements Tolkien kept ambiguous, such as the battles and the creatures. During shooting, the screenplays continued to evolve, {{in part due to}} contributions from cast members looking to further explore their characters. Most notable amongst these rewrites was the character Arwen, who was originally planned as a warrior princess, but reverted to her book counterpart, who remains physically inactive in the story (though <b>she</b> <b>sends</b> moral and military support).|$|E
5|$|In the Pokémon anime, the Saffron City Gym Leader, Sabrina owns an Abra, which <b>she</b> <b>sends</b> out in {{a battle}} against the series protagonist, Ash.

Ash later returns for a rematch, and Ash's Haunter makes Sabrina laugh, which causes Kadabra to also laugh due to the psychic bond it has with Sabrina. Because of Kadabra and Sabrina's laughter, {{they are unable to}} fight, and hand over the gym badge. Abra later appears in the series under the ownership of Mira, who offers to teleport everyone to Hearthome city using her Abra, but instead teleports them to a flooded city to find a Poké Ball containing a Sandshrew that was lost in the newly flooded lake. One of Abra and Kadabra's other appearances is living in an abandoned mining colony with several other Psychic-type Pokémon. Alakazam's first appearance was as a giant Alakazam awakened near the site of the Pokémopolis ruins. Alakazam has also been owned by many notable trainers, such as Luana, the Gym Leader of Kumquat Island, Eusine, Anabel, and Kenny.|$|E
5|$|The film {{focuses on}} Jack Goodwin, a young {{chemistry}} {{student who has}} discovered a novel compound that allows a person {{to be put in}} a state of sleep for any length of time.
