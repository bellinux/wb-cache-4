25|$|In a 1940 plan, {{which was}} revised in 1945, the IND Fulton Street Line would {{connect to the}} IND Rockaway Line {{in a similar manner}} to the 1939 plan, via an {{extension}} of the subway under Pitkin Avenue. The line, east of Euclid Avenue, would be 4 tracks, with local stations at 76th Street and 84th Street, and an express station at Cross Bay Boulevard. At Cross Bay Boulevard, a flying junction would let the local tracks cross over to the inside and the express tracks cross over to the outside. The layout would be similar to that of Manhattan's 168th Street station. East of Cross Bay Boulevard, another flying junction would bring a two-track branch over the line to a pair of portals north of Aqueduct – North Conduit Avenue station. Meanwhile, the Fulton Street Line's four tracks would merge into two tracks, and end at 105th Street (today's Aqueduct Racetrack), where a <b>scissors</b> <b>crossover</b> would be present just west of the station. Crossovers would also be located between the local and express pair of tracks east of 76th Street, and between the two express tracks east of Cross Bay Boulevard.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{main purpose}} of the hereby study was the {{description}} of microstructure and properties of the new low-carbon Mn-Cr-Mo-V-Ni bainitic cast steel developed in the AGH Laboratory of Phase Transformations for cast mono-blocks of <b>scissors</b> <b>crossovers.</b> Investigations comprise material in as-cast state and after various variants of normalization as well as normalization and high tempering. Design/methodology/approach: Analyses of microstructure, strength properties, impact toughness and crack resistance (KIc) were performed both for material in the as-cast state and after heat treatments. The influence of the initial microstructure on the investigated cast steel hardness – after the normalizing and after the normalizing and tempering – was determined. Findings: Changes in the microstructure of the cast bainitic <b>scissors</b> <b>crossovers</b> were determined and their properties described. Research limitations/implications: The investigations were performed in order to estimate a possibility of applying bainitic cast steels for production of <b>scissors</b> <b>crossovers</b> {{in the form of}} monolithic blocks. Practical implications: Application of bainitic cast steels for <b>scissors</b> <b>crossovers</b> in the form of monolithic blocks. Originality/value: Designing of the chemical composition of the bainitic cast steel (Mn-Cr-Mo-V-Ni) and its heat treatment...|$|R

5000|$|April 1961 saw the {{introduction}} of colour Multiple-Aspect Signalling and associated modifications to the station layout. The north face of the island platform became the new up platform, with the south face becoming the new down.

Lines 3 and 4 became the designations for the through non-platform lines. Subsequent removal of the <b>scissors</b> <b>crossovers</b> saw a further combination and renumbering of platforms to the current layout.|$|R
2500|$|In 1881 {{platforms}} 4 to 6 (Platform 5 being a bay to the south) were added, being [...] {{long and}} [...] wide.

Platforms 2 and 3 were lengthened by about [...] and new waiting rooms and refreshment rooms were provided, designed by the company architect John Holloway Sanders. A subway was installed to allow better transfer of luggage between platforms with hydraulic lifts to raise and lower luggage. The turntables were removed and replaced by <b>scissors</b> <b>crossovers,</b> the whole complex controlled by a signal box on the centre platform.|$|R
40|$|Connecting {{parallel}} rail tracks, <b>scissors</b> <b>crossovers</b> typically {{consist of}} four turnouts and a central diamond crossing, while flange-way gaps provide wheel flange clearance at {{the points of}} rail intersection. Guardrails, supported through base-plates, provide wheel guidance {{in the area of}} the gap. In the Athens Metro, within less than a year in operation, fracturing of a vast number of guardrail support base-plates was reported. This paper documents the methodology and results of a comprehensive investigation of the possible causes of these failures. This premature cracking was initially investigated through stress and acceleration measurements. Subsequently, a three-dimensional finite element model was developed to analyse the dynamic behaviour of the system with and without foundation deficiencies. It was unveiled that only the model with foundation deficiencies could reproduce the measured response. The role of foundation-structure interaction (FSI) proved doubly detrimental for the performance of the system: (i) the initial defective curved shape of the sleepers induced large bending pre-stress on the base-plates, and (ii) the defective gap-dominated foundation increased the flexibility of the system leading to further excessive sleeper bending, and thereby to increased distress of the base-plates. The combination of the two deficiencies was deemed responsible for the observed failure. The method of installation was shown to be of critical importance for the durability of the crossover. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|This {{station was}} the {{terminus}} of Line 5 from 1942 to 1985. As a result, {{there are four}} tracks and a <b>scissors</b> <b>crossover</b> {{just east of the}} station; two are used to reverse the direction of trains.|$|E
50|$|North of the station, {{the subway}} travels through a <b>scissors</b> <b>crossover</b> through its tunnels {{underneath}} Yonge Street, past Queen Street, and into Queen station.

50|$|The current station layout {{consists}} of four through-platforms numbered 1 to 4 from the south side. The original broad gauge station had only two 200 ft through platforms and a bay platform at {{the east end of}} the down platform. The Hillfield railway tunnels {{to the west of the}} station were dug under Stow Hill in the 1840s. On the closure of Dock Street and Mill Street stations to passengers in 1880, High Street station was greatly expanded: The up platform was made into an island - the north face 825 ft in length, and the south side 814 ft. The down platform was extended to 897 ft, with the west end bay extended to 428 ft. Two <b>scissors</b> <b>crossovers</b> were provided on these new platforms, effectively dividing them into two. The original down platform became Nos. 1 and 2. The bay became No. 3, the south face of the up platform Nos. 4 and 5 and the north face Nos. 6 and 7. The bay platform was mostly used for Monmouthshire western valleys services, but with the quadrupling of the line in 1912 trains from the bay platform (on the south side) now had to cross the entire station to get to the Gaer Tunnel on the north side. To address this the former loading dock on the north side of the station was made into a passenger platform (No. 8).|$|R
5000|$|The {{planning}} of a Cologne-Gross-Gerau high-speed railway in the 1970s envisaged a station between Limburg and Diez on its right bank (east of the Rhine) route option. The station {{would have been}} located south of the Lahn and west of the existing station and above the Lahn Valley Railway. Trains on the existing line from Wetzlar would have connected to services to Cologne and trains from Niederlahnstein would have connected to services towards Frankfurt. The four-track infrastructure would have had, {{in addition to the}} two central through tracks, two external platform tracks connected by <b>scissors</b> <b>crossovers</b> (with four sets of points) {{at each end of the}} station. The proposed station was assessed as having [...] "predominantly regional importance", which justified [...] "only a limited number of train stops". After the completion of the route selection process, Federal Cabinet decided on 20 December 1989 that the line would be built on the route of the high-speed line along the A3, as built. It also agreed to the building of a station at Limburg. An option running through the Rhine Valley was now finally off the table. In the same way that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate demanded a station at Montabaur, the state of Hesse demanded a station on its territory. In an agreement of March 1990 the premiers of the two states as well as the federal transport minister noted that there was consensus that [...] "a stop was required in the Limburg area".|$|R
5000|$|The {{planning}} of a Cologne-Gross-Gerau high-speed railway in the 1970s envisaged a station at Montabaur on its right bank (east of the Rhine) route alternative. The four-track infrastructure would have, {{in addition to}} the two central through tracks, two external platform tracks connected by <b>scissors</b> <b>crossovers</b> (with four sets of points) {{at each end of the}} station. The proposed station was assessed as having [...] "predominantly regional importance", which justified [...] "only a limited number of train stops". [...] A report commissioned by the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, which took into account only the territory of Rhineland-Palatine, determined in the late 1980s that 400,000 inhabitants and 210,000 employees would live in a car within 30 minutes in 2000. The route of the new line in Rhineland-Palatinate was the subject of many years of debate and political compromise. First, in the mid-1988, then Chancellor Helmut Kohl promised a high-speed link to the federal capital to the then mayor of Bonn, Hans Daniels. The Department of Transport developed, on the basis of this promise, a route running through Vilich in the northeastern outskirts of Bonn. This route would have cost around half a billion Deutschmarks (DM) more than the planned (and later realised) route via Siegburg, but half a billion DM less than running through Bonn Central Station (Hauptbahnhof). Prior to a decision of the Rhine route in the Federal Cabinet, the then premier of Rhineland-Palatinate, Carl-Ludwig Wagner 1989 called for a so-called option S in an interview in July. This envisaged a right bank route taking a sharp curve from Dernbach through a tunnel and a bridge over the Rhine to Koblenz before taking another a sharp curve back over another Rhine crossing to a purely right bank route to Frankfurt. The estimated additional costs of this option were DM 1.3 to 2.8 billion (about €0.7 to 1.4 billion). The Federal Transport Minister, Friedrich Zimmermann spoke of a [...] "provincial farce" [...] and suggested, as a compromise, the establishment of a high-speed station in Limburg to provide a connection with Koblenz. In addition to the establishment of the station, the compromise proposal provided for a package of other railway infrastructure in Rhineland-Palatinate. The then Deutsche Bundesbahn initially accepted the route via Limburg and Vilich in order to prevent further delays to the project. After the completion of the route selection process, Federal Cabinet decided on 20 December 1989 that the line would be built on the current route of the high-speed line along the A3. It also agreed to a station at Limburg. A station in Montabaur was not explicitly mentioned. On 21 March 1990, an agreement on the planned new line between the premiers of Rhineland-Palatinate and Hesse and the Federal Minister of Transport called for a site at Montabaur. A major reason for the proposal for this station was that by this time it had been decided that the three options considered for connecting to Limburg were not feasible and therefore there would be no direct connection to the Lahn Valley Railway, which would have provided a connection to both Koblenz and Gießen. The station that was built instead in Montabaur would have good accessibility to both these areas via a new autobahn interchange in Montabaur. [...] In the planning process, the possibility of an ICE stop was studied from 1991. In the spring of 1993, Heinz Dürr, the Chairman of Deutsche Bundesbahn, and Rainer Brüderle, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of Economics and Transport, agreed on the establishment of a station in Montabaur. Construction of the ICE railway station was confirmed at the completion of the planning process in 1995. Construction began in 1997.|$|R

50|$|During peak hours, some {{westbound}} Kwun Tong Line trains terminate at platform 2 {{and proceed}} eastbound past the <b>scissors</b> <b>crossover</b> to a reversing siding. The remaining trains continue to Whampoa Station, the next station westbound {{as well as}} the line's western terminus. This arrangement exists due to the limited capacity of the single terminating track at Whampoa, which cannot turn all of the Kwun Tong Line's trains during rush hours.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>scissors</b> <b>crossover</b> was {{installed}} {{just north of}} the station when the line was built, so that trains could easily crossover from one track to another, but was later removed in May 1984 during track rehabilitation because of maintenance costs. In 2012, the TTC decided to put this crossover back, as it would allow trains to turn back during service disruptions, once automatic train control is implemented in 2016.|$|E
50|$|When two {{crossovers}} {{are present}} in opposite directions, one after the other, the four-switch configuration is called a double crossover. If the crossovers in different directions overlap to form an ×, it is dubbed a <b>scissors</b> <b>crossover,</b> scissors crossing, or just scissors; or, due to the diamond in the center, a diamond crossover. This makes for a very compact track layout {{at the expense of}} using a level junction.|$|E

50|$|The {{station was}} laid out with a {{crossing}} loop around an island platform and sidings on both sides. On the east side were was an engine shed and a turntable. Three years after opening, in 1897, a junction and link line down to the Callander and Oban Railway, which passed below the West Highland route, was added. Originally, the junction incorporated a <b>scissors</b> <b>crossover,</b> allowing simultaneous moves through the junction. However until 1931 the link line was only used to exchange good wagons between the two lines. From 1931 onwards, it was also used for excursion traffic from Glasgow and the surrounding areas to the Oban line.|$|E

5000|$|When the {{original}} {{section of the}} Northern Line from Charing Cross to Golders Green and Archway (then Highgate) was opened in 1907, the terminus at Archway was provided with a <b>scissors</b> <b>crossover</b> {{just south of the}} station and the running lines beyond {{the north end of the}} platforms continued as separate dead-end sidings. When the line was extended to Highgate and East Finchley in 1939, the 'northbound' siding was extended as the northbound road while the 'southbound' siding was retained as a dead-end siding, extended at the north end with the new southbound line from Highgate joining it just before the southbound platform and a new connection from the northbound line to the siding, thus turning the old 'southbound' siding into a central reversing siding. The crossover south of the station was subsequently converted to a single trailing crossover but was decommissioned on 15 October 1967 when Archway was converted to programme-machine control from Coburg Street.(the signal box closed on 25 June 1961 when Archway became remote-controlled [...] ) The enlarged crossover tunnel remains although cable runs extend down its centre between the two tracks for most of its length. The layout of the platforms and underground passenger areas still reflect the station's former role as a terminus.|$|E
