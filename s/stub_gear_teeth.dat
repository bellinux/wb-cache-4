40|$|Regarding <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> shape {{measurement}} and the uncertainty evaluation method <b>Gear</b> <b>tooth</b> shape deviation {{can be divided}} into three types: profile deviations, helix deviations, and pitch deviations. Fig. 1 represents the principle behind gear deviation measurement. In all of the deviation measurements, measurement values are obtained from the y-position of the stylus. Therefore, the y-position of the stylus represents the output quantity. Other quantities (stylus x-position, stylus z-position, and <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> surface position) represent the input quantities. Accordingly, if we search for a point on the <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> surface whose x-coordinate and z-coordinate are equal to x- and z-position of the stylus, the y-coordinate of the <b>gear</b> <b>tooth</b> surface should be equal to the y-position of the stylus.

40|$|The present paper {{concentrates}} on the investigations regarding the situations of frictional shear stress of <b>gear</b> <b>teeth</b> and the relevant frictional effects on bending stresses and transmission error in gear meshing. Sliding friction {{is one of the}} major reasons causing gear failure and vibration; the adequate consideration of frictional effects is essential for understanding gear contact behavior accurately. An analysis of tooth frictional effect on gear performance in spur gear is presented using finite element method.
