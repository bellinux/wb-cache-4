40|$|Iron- and manganese-promoted <b>sulfated</b> <b>zirconia</b> is a {{catalyst}} for the conversion of propane, but the rate of conversion of propane is {{much less than the}} rate of conversion of butane. Whereas this catalyst appears to be a good candidate for practical, industrial conversion of butane, it appears to lack sufficient activity for practical conversion of propane. The propane conversion data reported here provide excellent insights into the chemistry of the catalytic conversion. Solid and catalysts, namely, <b>sulfated</b> <b>zirconia,</b> iron- and manganese-promoted <b>sulfated</b> <b>zirconia,</b> and USY zeolite, were tested for conversion of propane at 1 atm, 200 - 450 {degrees}C, and propane partial pressures in the range of 0. 01 - 0. 05 atm.

At the higher temperatures, only cracking and dehydrogenation products were observed. In contrast to the zirconia-supported catalysts, USY zeolite was observed to convert propane (into propylene, methane, and ethylene) only at temperatures {ge} 400 {degrees}C. The initial (5 min on stream) rates of propane conversion in the presence of iron- and manganese-promoted <b>sulfated</b> <b>zirconia,</b> <b>sulfated</b> <b>zirconia,</b> and USY zeolite at 450 {degrees}C and 0. 01 atm propane partial pressure were 3. 3 x 10 {sup - 8 }, 0. 3 x 10 {sup - 8 }, and 0. 06 x 10 {sup - 8 } mol/(s{center_dot}g), respectively.

These modified Nafion nanocomposite membrane with inorganic nanoparticles have been designed to run at operating temperatures between 120 oC and 140 oC because higher temperature operation reduces the impact of carbon monoxide poisoning, allows attainment of high power density and reduces cathode flooding as water is produced as vapor. The inorganic nanoparticles were incorporated within the Nafion matrix by recast, ion exchange and impregnation methods. The membrane properties were determined by ion exchange capacity (IEC), water uptake, methanol permeability and proton conductivity. The characterization of the inorganic nanoparticles within the nanocomposite membranes was determined by X-Ray diffraction (XRD), Brunau-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) for structural properties.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to further develop a method of direct {{impregnation}} in the preparation of <b>sulfated</b> titania, <b>zirconia</b> and ferric oxides supported on the mesoporous silica molecular sieve (MCM- 41) as acid catalyst composites (C. Chen et al., 2001; Y. Wang et al., 2009) and to characterize their structures and acid nature. Sulfated transition metal oxides such as S-TiO 2, S-ZrO 2, and S-Fe 2 O 3 as solid superacids have been received much attention due to their significant catalytic activities in hydrocarbon conversions such as esterification, isomerization, alkylation, etc. The remarkable catalytic activities for these sulfated transition metal oxides are mainly attributed to their properties as superacids. The generation and structures of Brönsted and Lewis acid sites are responsible for these activities (Corma et al., 1994; Yadav & Nair, 1999). Unfortunately, the relatively small surface area for the sulfated transition metal oxides may limit their usefulness in catalytic activities (J. Wang & Mou, 2008; Y. Wang et al., 2009). Nano-scale particle mesoporous molecular sieves have advantages in catalysis due to their large pore size, pore volume, uniform pore structures and high specific surface area (Giraldo et al., 2007; Kresge et al., 1992). The large pore size and volume provide adequate diffusion of molecules through the catalyst pores. Fine solid powders with high surface areas ensure probable collisions among the reaction substrates. However, these mesoporous silica materials such as MCM- 41 and SBA- 15 have their limitation in the low acid strength without the addition of other metal ions (Giraldo et al., 2007). A direct impregnation method has been developed to explore the positive characteristic of both materials discussed above. The sulfated metal oxides continue manifest their remarkable catalytic activities while the high surface area of the mesoporous silica structure ensures a large number of acid sites. The use of direct exchange of metal containing precursors in the as-synthesized MCM- 41 substrate produced catalyst composites which were evaluated for the esterification of acetic acid and n-butanol. S-TiO 2 /MCM- 41 and S-ZrO 2 /MCM- 41 catalyst composites exhibit the higher esterification rates than S-Fe 2 O 3 /MCM- 41. After calcination the MCM- 41 and metal compounds were found to agglomerate and the metals dispersed onto as well as inside the mesopore structure. S-TiO 2 /MCM- 41 with up to 80 wt% metal loading still retained the MCM- 41 mesoporous structure after high temperature calcination. However for S-ZrO 2 /MCM- 41 and S-Fe 2 O 3 /MCM- 41 composites, the mesopores became blocked with up to 70 wt% and 50 wt% content loadings respectively. Both Brönsted and Lewis acid sites were detected on the three kinds of catalyst composites in spite of their diminishing in numbers with increasing temperature. For both the acid sites and the structures were responsible for the catalytic performances of S-TiO 2 /MCM- 41, S-ZrO 2 /MCM- 41, and S-Fe 2 O 3 /MCM- 41 catalyst composites as the solid superacids catalysts in the reactions...|$|R

The surface structure of <b>sulfated</b> <b>zirconia</b> has been studied widely in order to elucidate the nature of active sites since the discovery of its catalytic property for alkanes conversion at low temperature. Nevertheless, no consensus has been reached so far. Here, we report that the labile sulfate, which can be removed from <b>sulfated</b> <b>zirconia</b> by water washing, acts as crucial component {{for the active site}} of <b>sulfated</b> <b>zirconia.</b> Experimental Sulfate-doped zirconium hydroxide was obtained from Magnesium Electron, Inc. (XZO 1077 / 01), which was heated up to 873 K with a ramp rate of 10 K/min in static air and kept at 873 K for 3 h, denoted as SZ. Water washing technique was applied to the above calcined <b>sulfated</b> <b>zirconia.</b> 20 g of SZ were suspended in 400 mL bi-distilled water and then filtered. Repeated the washing procedure for 3 times, then the cake was dried at room temperature. The resulting powder is denoted as SZ-WW. The materials were characterized by IR spectroscopy, (including the sorption of probe molecules such as pyridine and CO 2), TAP measurements, XRD and the sulfate content was determined. n-Butane isomerization reactions were carried out in a quartz micro tube reactor under atmospheric pressure. Prior to the reaction, the catalyst was activated at 473 K for 2 h in He flow (10 ml/min). Results and Discussion The calcined <b>sulfated</b> <b>zirconia,</b> SZ, showed a catalytic activity of 0. 015 mol/g/s for n-butane skeletal isomerization with an initial iso-butane selectivity of 96 % at 373 K. It {{is interesting to note that}} the removal of water soluble sulfate by water washing treatment of the parent sample resulted in an inactive sample (SZ-WW). The content of sulfate of the water washed sample (SZ-WW) is 0. 25 mmol/g, which is much lower than that of the original calcined <b>sulfated</b> <b>zirconia,</b> 0. 44 mmol/g. Thus, 43 % of the total sulfate of <b>sulfated</b> <b>zirconia</b> was removed by water washing. The water washing treatment not only removed the water soluble sulfate of SZ, but also the Brønsted acid sites leading to an increase of Lewis acid concentration. The IR spectra of water washed <b>sulfated</b> <b>zirconia</b> (SZ-WW) and <b>sulfated</b> <b>zirconia</b> (SZ) samples showed pronounced difference in the region OH and S=O vibrations. In the IR region of OH group above 3600 cm- 1, water washing increased the intensity of the OH band at 3634 cm- 1 and shifted it to higher frequency, 3661 cm- 1. In addition, water washing reduced a fraction of sulfate groups at high frequency leading to sulfate stretching vibrations of water washed sample (SZ-WW) at 1391 cm- 1 compared to the parent sample (SZ) at 1404 cm- 1. Note that the wavenumber of the S=O stretching vibration is related to the SO bond order [,], indicating that fractions of highly covalent sulfate were removed. IR spectra recorded during adsorption of CO 2 showed the formation of bicarbonate on the surface of the washed sample but not on the original sample. SZ-WW featured an about equal number of two different types of Lewis acid sites, while for SZ one type of Lewis acid sites was predominant. The data indicate that water washing produces domains of bare zirconia surface, free of sulfate. The results show for the first time that the water soluble sulfate species are responsible for the formation of highly covalent sulfates as well as the Brønsted acid sites, which are essential for the alkane isomerization reaction on <b>sulfated</b> <b>zirconia</b> at low temperature.

In addition, a reduction of sulfate groups as SO 42 – on zirconia surface was observed. As a consequence, a decline in Brønsted sites with calcinationtemperature enhancement also prevailed.

The samples were characterized using XRD, FT-IR, BET and TEM analysis and their activity were investigated in esterification reaction of oleic acid. The findings of this study revealed that 25 mol % SrO/S-ZrO 2 had the highest yield in the esterification reaction. It was also concluded that strontia-supported <b>sulfated</b> <b>zirconia</b> could improve the low reusability of the catalyst. Furthermore, 95 % conversion was also obtained at optimized conditions (i. e., 100 °C, 2 wt. % of catalyst, 6 : 1 molar ratio of methanol/oleic acid and for a period of 30 minutes) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A kind {{of solid}} acid (<b>sulfated</b> <b>zirconia)</b> was {{proposed}} {{to be used}} as the catalyst for the hydrolysis of ethyl lactate because esterification-hydrolysis was usually applied to produce lactic acid of high purity. The <b>sulfated</b> <b>zirconia</b> was prepared via a simple chemical precipitation and impregnation approach. The prepared catalysts were characterized by means of XRD, TG-DSC, FT-IR, and NH 3 -TPD. Catalytic activity of the prepared catalysts was evaluated by the hydrolysis reaction of ethyl lactate. The characterization results showed that the prepared <b>sulfated</b> <b>zirconia</b> was of tetragonal phase at the optimum calcination temperature of 650 °C and had strong acidity. The conversion of hydrolysis of ethyl lactate using the prepared catalyst was 82. 62 %. Although the conversion was lower than that of liquid acid (p-toluenesulfonicacid), the solid acid catalyst was easier to be separated from the products. It resolved the problems of pollution and catalyst reuse. This work might provide a new green process for producing lactic acid of high purity...|$|E
40|$|The {{esterification}} of {{octanoic acid}} and ethanol using <b>sulfated</b> <b>zirconia</b> {{in the presence}} of triglycerides is one of the methods to produce biodiesel. As the fuel used today, petroleum is estimated depleted around 30 - 45 years in the future, Biodiesel is an alternative biofuel that can be produced using esterification method. The esterification of octanoic acid is done to determine the best operation condition to yield better conversion of octanoic acid. The operation conditions for the esterification of octanoic acid are temperature of reaction, amount of <b>sulfated</b> <b>zirconia</b> used, amount of triglycerides presence and molar ratio of octanoic acid to ethanol. The temperature of reaction ranged from 30 ºC to 50 ºC. The amount of <b>sulfated</b> <b>zirconia</b> used ranged from 0. 5 g to 1. 5 g. The amount of triglycerides presence ranged from 30 ml to 70 ml. The molar ratio of octanoic acid to ethanol ranged to 1 : 1 to 1 : 5. The best operating condition achieved for the esterification of octanoic acid and ethanol were 30 ºC reaction temperature, 1. 5 g <b>sulfated</b> <b>zirconia</b> used, 1 : 1 molar ratio of octanoic acid to ethanol and 50 ml of triglycerides presence in the esterification. The kinetic model been used is pseudo-homogeneous kinectic model based on the experimental data gained.

40|$|Motivated by {{the goal}} of finding {{improved}} catalysts for low- temperature conversion of light alkanes into fuel components or precursors of fuel components, the researchers have investigated <b>sulfated</b> <b>zirconia</b> and promoted <b>sulfated</b> <b>zirconia</b> for conversion of butane, propane, and ethane. Catalyst performance data for <b>sulfated</b> <b>zirconia</b> promoted with iron and manganese show {{that it is the}} most active noncorrosive, nonhalide catalyst known for n-butane isomerization, and it is an excellent candidate catalyst for new low- temperature n-butane isomerization processes to make isobutane, which can be converted by established technology into methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE). Various transition metals have been found to work as promoters of <b>sulfated</b> <b>zirconia</b> for n-butane isomerization. The combination of iron and manganese is the best known combination of promoters yet discovered. The iron- and manganese-promoted <b>sulfated</b> <b>zirconia</b> is also a catalyst for conversion of propane and of ethane. Ethane is converted into ethylene and butanes {{in the presence of the}} iron- and manganese-promoted sulfated zirconia; propane is also converted into butane, among other products. However, the activities of the catalyst for these reactions are orders of magnitude less than the activity for n-butane conversion, and there is no evidence that the catalyst would be of practical value for conversion of alkanes lighter than butane. The product distribution data for ethane and propane conversion provide new insights into the nature of the catalyst and its acidity. These data suggest the involvement of Olah superacid chemistry, whereby the catalyst protonates the alkane itself, giving carbonium ions (as transition states). The mechanism of protonation of the alkane may also pertain to the conversion of butane, but there is good evidence that the butane conversion also proceeds via alkene intermediates by conventional mechanisms of carbenium ion formation and rearrangement...|$|E

The characterization {{was carried out}} using X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Brauner–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area measurements, X-ray fluorescence, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, zeta size potential, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The cytotoxicity of iron–manganese-doped <b>sulfated</b> <b>zirconia</b> nanoparticles was determined using 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays against three human cancer cell lines (breast cancer MDA-MB 231 cells, colon carcinoma HT 29 cells, and hepatocellular carcinoma HepG 2 cells) and two normal human cell lines (normal hepatocyte Chang cells and normal human umbilical vein endothelial cells [HUVECs]). The results suggest {{for the first time}} that iron–manganese-doped <b>sulfated</b> <b>zirconia</b> nanoparticles are cytotoxic to MDA-MB 231 and HepG 2 cancer cells but have less toxicity to HT 29 and normal cells at concentrations from 7. 8 µg/mL to 500 µg/mL. The morphology of the treated cells was also studied, and the results supported those from the cytotoxicity study in that the nanoparticle-treated HepG 2 and MDA-MB 231 cells had more dramatic changes in cell morphology than the HT 29 cells. In this manner, this study provides the first evidence that iron–manganese-doped <b>sulfated</b> <b>zirconia</b> nanoparticles should be further studied for a wide range of cancer applications without detrimental effects on healthy cell functions...|$|E
40|$|Titanium {{silicalite}} (TS- 1) {{loaded with}} <b>sulfated</b> <b>zirconia</b> as bifunctional oxidative and acidic catalyst has been synthesized at various loadings of zirconium (2 - 20 wt%). Structure and {{properties of the}} samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature programmed reduction (TPR), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and UV-vis diffuse reflectance (UV-vis DR) spectroscopy techniques. The monolayer dispersion capacity of zirconium on the TS- 1 {{was found to be}} 0. 65 Zr 4 + nm- 2 TS- 1. The UV-vis DR spectroscopy showed that the tetrahedral coordination of the titanium was observed in all samples, while octahedral zirconium was only observed in the samples containing high amount of zirconium loading (10, 15 and 20 wt%). The TPR profiles suggested that the zirconium structure impregnated on the surface of TS- 1 with high amount of zirconium loading (15 and 20 wt%) have a similar structure to <b>sulfated</b> <b>zirconia</b> calcined at 500 °C. Adsorption of pyridine onto the samples indicated that Brönsted acid sites are only present in samples with high <b>sulfated</b> <b>zirconia</b> loading, i. e. 15 and 20 wt%. As analyzed by XRD, the formation of Brönsted acid sites is due to the presence of disulfate species on the surface of TS- 1. It has been demonstrated that samples with 15 and 20 wt% loadings of <b>sulfated</b> <b>zirconia</b> showed activity towards consecutive transformation of 1 -octene to 1, 2 -octanediol through the formation of 1, 2 -epoxyoctane using aqueous hydrogen peroxide...|$|E

Calculation of ammonia adsorbed is 4.18, 3.446, 3.344, and 1.938  mmol NH 3 /g for MZS- 400, MZS- 500, MZS- 600, and MZS- 700, respectively. The result showed {{a decrease in the}} amount of ammonia being adsorbed by the catalyst as calcination temperature increased. <b>Sulfated</b> <b>zirconia</b> calcined at 400  °C with an amorphous structure tends to adsorbed more ammonia than other catalysts. This amorphous <b>sulfated</b> <b>zirconia</b> has hydroxyl groups bond to Zr which was undergo incomplete elimination during calcination process. The hydroxyl group is a suitable site for chemisorption of ammonia at the surface of zirconia. As the calcination temperature reached 700  °C, <b>sulfated</b> <b>zirconia</b> shows a decreased in the amount of ammonia adsorbed. The decreased in specific surface area might cause a decrease of ammonia adsorption. Sulfate groups were reported to be expelled from pores to the surface of zirconium network during calcination [20]. The increase of heat on higher calcination temperature resulted in the successive loss of sulfate from the surface, which in turn could decrease suitable sites for ammonia adsorption.|$|E
