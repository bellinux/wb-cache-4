50|$|An aerial crane or {{flying crane}} is a {{helicopter}} used to lift heavy loads. As aerial cranes, helicopters carry loads connected to long cables or slings {{in order to}} place heavy equipment when other methods are not available or economically feasible, or when the job must be accomplished in remote or inaccessible areas, such as the tops of tall buildings or {{the top of a}} hill or mountain, far from the nearest road. Helicopters were first used as aerial cranes in the 1950s, {{but it was not until}} the 1960s that their popularity in construction and other industries began to catch on. The most consistent use of helicopters as aerial cranes is in the logging industry to lift large trees out of rugged terrain where vehicles aren't able to reach, or where environmental concerns prohibit the buildings of roads.

40|$|Mid {{urethral}} sling {{procedures have}} become the surgical treatment of choice for female stress urinary incontinence. Innovative modifications of mid urethral sling procedures were recently introduced with the claim of offering similar efficacy and decreased morbidity. We compared the efficacy and morbidity of an innovative single incision mid urethral tape and an established transobturator procedure. We performed a prospective, randomized, controlled trial in 6 teaching hospitals in Belgium and The Netherlands between 2007 and 2009. A total of 96 patients received a TVT Secur™ <b>single</b> incision <b>sling</b> and 98 received a TVT™ Obturator System. We collected data on patient characteristics, surgery related parameters, adverse events, clinical followup, Urogenital Distress Inventory and SF- 36 ® scores, validated questionnaires on daily life activities and visual analog scores objectifying pain. Followup was 1 year. One-year followup was available for 75 <b>single</b> incision <b>sling</b> and 85 obturator system cases. Stress urinary incontinence could be objectified in 16. 4 % of the patients with a <b>single</b> incision <b>sling</b> and in 2. 4 % with an obturator system (p < 0. 05). Stress urinary incontinence was subjectively reported by 24 % of <b>single</b> incision <b>sling</b> and 8 % of obturator system patients (p < 0. 05). One year after surgery the mean ± SD UDI incontinence domain score in the <b>single</b> incision <b>sling</b> and obturator system groups was 21 ± 24 and 13 ± 21, respectively (p < 0. 01). Patients with a <b>single</b> incision <b>sling</b> experienced significantly less pain during the first 2 weeks after surgery (p < 0. 05) and returned significantly earlier to normal daily activity. The OR of re-intervention for stress urinary incontinence 1 year after receiving a <b>single</b> incision <b>sling</b> vs an obturator system was 2. 3 (95 % CI 1. 9 - 2. 7).

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} if 3 types of mid-urethral synthetic slings are visually the same. Materials and Methods: A retropubic, obturator, and <b>single</b> incision <b>sling</b> was individually placed in three cadavers. Tension was set using a spacer (obturator and retropubic). <b>Single</b> incision <b>sling</b> (SIS) tension was set by visual inspection.

The primary {{aim of this}} randomized, blinded, {{controlled}} {{clinical trial}} was to compare the percent root coverage obtained using a coronally positioned tunnel surgery plus an acellular dermal matrix allograft (ADM) with <b>single</b> tooth <b>sling</b> versus continuous sling sutures 6 months post-surgically. Methods. Twenty-four patients with 1 site of 3 mm Miller Class I or II recession were treated and followed for 6 months. Twelve patients received a coronally positioned tunnel plus ADM and <b>single</b> tooth <b>sling</b> sutures (<b>Single)</b> and were considered the test group. The positive control group consisted of 12 patients treated with a coronally positioned tunnel technique plus ADM with continuous sling sutures (Continuous).

50|$|A {{variation}} of the <b>single</b> point <b>sling</b> is used in precision target rifle shooting from the prone position. The sling is not intended as a carrying aid, but is used to steady the rifle. For a right-handed shooter, the sling attaches {{to the top of}} the left arm, and clips onto the forend of the rifle. The left arm is wrapped under the sling. The sling with upper and lower arm form three sides of a triangle that provide a steady support for the rifle.|$|R
50|$|The weapon comes {{complete}} with an Aimpoint TL1 Optic, <b>single</b> point <b>sling,</b> cleaning kit and quick detachable vertical handgrip. The {{top of the}} weapon has an aluminum NAR (NATO Accessory Rail) integrated into the top receiver. There are NAR rails on the 3, 6 and 9 o’clock positions. The lower rail is machined aluminum while the lateral rails are made of the same polymer material as the trigger housing. The {{reason for this is}} that it is more likely that the rail in the 6 o’clock position will be used with a sighting device such as a laser, whereas the side rails will probably be used of illumination devices which do not require maintaining zero.|$|R
5000|$|The second semi-naval {{variant of}} the Seafire {{and the first to}} be built as such, was the Seafire F Mk IIc which was based on the Spitfire Vc. The Vc had several {{refinements}} over the Spitfire Vb. Apart from the modifications included in the main batch of Seafire Ibs this version incorporated catapult spools, and a <b>single</b> <b>slinging</b> lug {{on either side of the}} fuselage, just behind the engine bulkhead. Three subtypes were produced, the F Mk IIc and FR Mk IIc (fighter reconnaissance), powered by a Merlin 46, and the L Mk IIc powered by a low altitude Merlin 32 specifically manufactured for naval use. This version of the Merlin used a [...] "cropped" [...] supercharger impellor to provide greater power at low altitudes than the standard engines; delivering 1,585 hp (1,182 kW) at 2,750 ft (838 m). Both engine models drove a four bladed 10 ft 9 in (3.28 m) diameter Rotol propeller. Because this version used the [...] "C" [...] wing the Hispano cannon were fed from a 120-round belt magazine, otherwise the armament was the same as that of the Ib; the FR also carried two F24 cameras. After trials of Rocket Assisted Take Off Gear (RATOG) apparatus (small solid-fuel rocket motors which could be attached to the fuselage or wings of aircraft to help shorten the take-off run) in February 1943, this equipment became a standard fitting available for all Seafires. However, many FAA pilots rarely used RATOG, in part as there was little need for it, and due to the risks posed by an instance of asymmetric ignition.|$|R
5000|$|Single-point sling: A {{specialized}} sling {{design that}} permits the shooter to transition to firing {{from the opposite}} shoulder. Like the 3-point sling, the single-point sling permits the shooter to drop the weapon and let it hang downward while still attached to their body. This sling design is best suited for short-term tactical use. A single-point sling is only worn in one way, and cannot provide {{the same degree of}} long-term anti-fatigue weight support as other slings. The one great advantage of the single point design is that it is very easy to switch from shoulder to shoulder for weak side barricade shooting. [...] Negative attributes of the <b>single</b> point <b>sling</b> include a tendency to make the rifle dangle and hang off the shooter in an inconvenient fashion; it can interfere with the shooter's movement and hang up on the shooter's gear.|$|R

40|$|Objective : We present our {{preliminary}} results of bulbar urethral <b>sling</b> (<b>single</b> bolster) in treatment of postprostatectomy urinary incontinence (PPUI). Materials and Methods: From May 2003 to June 2005, six patients with postprostatectomy urinary incontinence (transurethral resection of prostate in five patients and after open prostatectomy in one patient) underwent prolene mesh bulbar urethral sling surgery. Preoperative evaluation included physical examination, neurological assessment, stress cystogram and urethrocystoscopy. Urodynamic evaluation {{was done in}} all patients for abdominal leak point pressure and ruling out bladder pathology. Results : Urodynamic studies did not demonstrate bladder instability in any patient. Mean abdominal leak point pressure was 43 cm of water (range 26 - 80 cm of water). Mean duration of hospital stay was 3. 2 days. Follow-up ranged from 6 - 22 months. Four patients out of six patients were completely dry till their last follow-up. One patient developed mild stress incontinence after one year of the surgery and required use of one to two pads per day. Mean pad use after surgery was 0. 6 pads per day in comparison to mean pad usage of 6. 4 pads per day preoperatively. One patient was over-continent after the procedure and required clean intermittent catheterization till last follow-up (six months). Mean cost of the procedure was $ 350 + 15.

40|$|The {{advent of}} the mid-urethral sling (MUS) 15 years ago has {{drastically}} changed the surgical management of stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Both retropubic and transobturator MUS can {{be placed in the}} ambulatory setting with excellent results. The tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) sling has the most robust and long-term data, but more recent literature suggests that the transobturator tape sling may offer comparable efficacy in appropriately selected patients. <b>Single</b> incision <b>sling</b> (SIS) is the newest addition to the MUS group and was developed in an attempt to minimize morbidity and create an anti-incontinence procedure that could be performed in the office. The efficacy of SIS remains unknown as the current literature regarding SIS lacks long-term results and comparative trials. The suprapubic arc sling appears to have equally effective outcomes in at least the short-term when compared with TVT. Although evolution of the SIS has led to a less invasive procedure with decreased post-op pain and reduced recovery time, durability of efficacy could be the endpoint we are sacrificing. Until longer-term data and more quality comparison trials are available, tailoring one′s choice of MUS to the individual patient and her unique clinical parameters remains the best option...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction The {{prevalence}} of urinary incontinence is increasing. Two major risk factors are overweight and age. We present objective and subjective cure rates of elderly and overweight patients treated with an adjustable single-incision sling system (AJUST™, C. R. BARD, Inc.). Materials and Methods Between 04 / 2009 and 02 / 2012 we treated 100 female {{patients with the}} <b>single</b> incision <b>sling.</b> Patients were retrospectively evaluated by Stamey degree of incontinence, cough test, pad use, and overall satisfaction. The primary outcomes {{of the study were}} objective and subjective cure rates, secondary outcomes were the safety profile of the sling and complications. Results The overall success rate in this population was 84. 6 % with a mean follow-up of 9. 3 months. The average usage of pads per day decreased from 4. 9 to 1. 6 and was significantly lower in patients with a BMI < 30 (p= 0. 004). Postoperative residual SUI was also lower in patients with a BMI < 30 (p= 0. 006). Postoperative satisfaction was better in patients with a lower BMI, but this difference did not reach a level of significance (p= 0. 055). There were no complications such as bleeding, bladder injury, or tape infection. Conclusions In elderly and obese patients a considerable success rate is achievable with this quick and minimal invasive procedure. However, the success rate shows a clear trend in favor of a lower body-mass-index. The cut-off point has been identified at a BMI of 30. The AJUST™ system can be regarded as safe and beneficial for elderly and obese patients...|$|R
5000|$|Most commonly, [...]22 Long Rifle {{cartridges}} are used, especially initially, {{since the}} ammunition is inexpensive and recoil is negligible - factors that bear {{consideration in the}} face of two or more days of very intense shooting practice, firing 500+ rounds. A magazine-fed, semi-automatic rifle with quality iron peep sights and a military loop sling is what is most commonly used; example rifles are the Ruger 10/22 and the Marlin 795.The unofficial preferred rifle is a so-called [...] "Liberty Training Rifle" [...] (LTR), consisting of a Ruger 10/22 with military-style aftermarket sights made by Tech-Sights, and an inexpensive military-style web sling. Tube-fed magazine rifles, such as the Marlin Model 60, can be used, but are not as amenable to learning all the skills that are taught since they do not have removable magazines, and the action of changing out a magazine has to be simulated. Some participants prefer to use a telescopic sight if their eyes are not able to work well with iron sights. [...] Appleseed shooting clinics require approximately 500+ rounds of ammunition for the two-day course.<<ref name=BHM/> [...] The skill sets that are taught include shooting from standing, sitting/kneeling, and prone (flat on the ground) positions, as well as shooting after transitioning from standing to sitting/kneeling, and after transitioning from standing to prone, all of which are shot with time limits. Rifles are generally never loaded when transitioning from standing to either sitting or prone positions, in keeping with the 4 Rules, except when doing a 4 Minute AQT containing transitions from standing to sitting and from sitting to prone, during which times the rifle's safety is engaged. Extensive use of the loop sling is made for accuracy, and multiple sling techniques/positions are taught (e.g., hasty-loop two-point sling, hasty-hasty two point <b>sling,</b> <b>single</b> point loop <b>sling,</b> high-loop sling, etc.). These sling positions are variously suitable for shooting accurately either quickly or slowly, over low/medium/high ground cover, among standing/sitting/kneeling/prone positions, as situations merit. Different techniques for shooting off-hand are also taught, dependent on the style of stock on one's rifle (e.g., using a high [...] "chicken-wing" [...] technique with a straight rifle stock vs. using a low [...] "chicken-wing" [...] technique with a pistol-grip rifle stock).|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: A retrospective, dual-center, {{cohort study}} on the <b>single</b> {{incision}} MiniArc <b>sling</b> and the transobturator Monarc sling {{in the treatment of}} stress urinary incontinence is presented. We hypothesized that both systems would perform equally well. METHODS: One hundred thirty-one (MiniArc n = 75, Monarc n = 56) consecutive patients were evaluated. Evaluation was performed by cough stress test (CST), daily pad use, IIQ- 7, UDI- 6, and a 0 - 5 visual analog scale for quality of life. The 1 -year data are presented. RESULTS: Six weeks after surgery, 91 % of the patients in both populations had a negative CST. At 1 year, 85 % of the MiniArc group and 89 % of the Monarc group (p = 0. 60) maintained a negative CST. QoL, symptom scores, and number of pads improved significantly and were comparable in both groups. Complication rates were similar.

40|$|Objective: To {{ascertain}} whether low preoperational maximal urethral closure pressure (MUCP) affects {{the outcomes of}} <b>single</b> incision <b>sling</b> (SIS) procedures and changes MUCP values postsurgery. Material and methods: There were 112 (MUCP ≥  40  cmH 2 O, n =  88; MUCP <  40  cmH 2 O, n =  24) consecutive women with urodynamic stress incontinence who had undergone SIS (MiniArc) procedures included in this study. The threshold of 40  cmH 2 O was used since {{it has been shown}} to be a significant risk factor for failed incontinence surgery. Clinical outcomes were assessed by the cough stress test, the 1 -hour pad test, the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire-Short Form, the Urogenital Distress Inventory six-item questionnaire, the Sexual Questionnaire-SF, and postoperative changes in the urodynamic parameters. A comparison of the 1 -year follow-up data is presented. Results: Three months postsurgery, a significant decrease was observed in the 1 -hour pad test, from 20. 6  g preoperatively to 0. 73  g postoperatively (p <  0. 001). The objective cure rate was 82. 1 % without any significant differences between the two groups (p =  0. 202). At 3  months and 1  year after surgery, significantly decreasing Urogenital Distress Inventory six-item questionnaire and Incontinence Impact Questionnaire-Short Form, and increasing Sexual Questionnaire-SF scores were observed in both groups, without any significant differences between the two groups. No statistically significant difference in the subjective cured rate was noted between the two groups at the 3 -month and 18. 4  month follow-ups. The postoperative MUCP was significantly decreased in the MUCP ≥ 40 group (p <  0. 05) while significantly increased in the MUCP <  40 group (p =  0. 006). Conclusions: These results suggest that SIS is a safe and highly effective treatment for urodynamic stress incontinence even in women with low MUCP at a mean follow-up of 18. 4  months.

40|$|Objectives:We {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the efficacy of transobturator tape (TOT) and <b>single</b> incision mini <b>sling</b> (SIMS) procedures {{in the treatment of}} stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Materials and Methods: The data of 32 patients who underwent TOT(Promedon®) or SIMS (Ophira®) operations related to SUI between January 2010 - August 2012 were retrospectively evaluated. The sample divided in two groups according to the operation type. The demographical features, preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative data were analysed and compared between two groups {{to evaluate the}} efficacy of the operations in SUI. All patients were assessed with a detailed history, physcical examination, cough test, Q-tip test, ultrasonography, postvoiding residual measurement, cystometry and UDI- 6, IIQ- 7 questionares. Postoperatively, the patients without any incontinence on cough test or sistometry were defined as the success. Results: The parameters of age, menapousal status, number of vaginal delivery, and body mass index were similar in two groups. The mean operation time was significantly shorter in SIMS group (16 ± 3 vs 27 ± 5, p 0. 05). Postoperative UDI- 6 and IIQ- 7 scores were 3. 5 ± 3. 4 vs 3. 8 ± 4. 8 and 4. 4 ± 4. 2 vs 5. 1 ± 5, 6 respectively, and they were similar (p> 0. 05 in both).
