50|$|Mandrels are not recent inventions. Metal {{machining}} {{utilizing the}} spinning {{process has been}} recorded {{as far back as}} ancient Egyptian times. In metal spinning, a wood or metal <b>spinning</b> <b>mandrel</b> is used, the form of which corresponds with the internal contour of the part to be produced. This method securely clamps the raw material and allows for accurate machining into the desired final form. Since the material is clamped internally, there is no interference to the operator from the lathe/mandrel assembly during production.|$|E
5000|$|On the press, four (up to six) {{different}} ink rollers {{supply the}} colors that will coat the individual printer plates. Printer plates contact a rubberized blanket on a rotating wheel, {{resulting in a}} complete negative color image on the blanket. Clean cans are fed into the printer and are placed on a steel mandrel. The <b>spinning</b> <b>mandrel</b> then rotates the can body against the rotating blanket, resulting in {{the transfer of the}} final graphic image onto the can body. Other coatings are applied after the ink, and then are sent to the UV ovens.|$|E
5000|$|The Gold Molded process {{involved}} {{taking a}} wax master {{and putting it}} in a vacuum chamber. The master record was put on a <b>spinning</b> <b>mandrel,</b> the pump sucked all {{the air out of}} a glass bell jar, and 2 pieces of gold leaf were hooked to an induction coil. The current was turned on, a magnet was spun around the outside to turn the mandrel, and the gold vaporized a very thin coating on the master. This master was put on a motor in a plating tank and copper was used to back the gold up. The master record was melted, then taken out of the mold to reveal a negative of the grooves in the metal. The master cylinder had to have wider feed as the grooves shrink in length through each process. The master mold is used to create [...] "mothers" [...] and these are then further processed to make working molds.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} the results of radial strain distribution measurement throughout the part after multi-pass conventional metal spinning by the circle grid analysis method. The influence of the mandrel speed, workpiece geometry and planar anisotropy of material on the radial strain was studied. For experiment design, an orthogonal array L 27 was used and ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) was carried out. Based on the results it is determined that the sequence of factors affecting radial strain corresponds to geometry of <b>spun</b> part, <b>mandrel</b> speed, planar anisotropy of the sheet. In particular, it is found that the workpiece geometry (specific areas of spun part: mandrel/workpiece radius, conical area, cylindrical area) is the most important factor which influences the radial strain of the spun part...|$|R
50|$|Metal-spinning lathes {{are almost}} as simple as wood-turning lathes. Typically, metal <b>spinning</b> {{requires}} a <b>mandrel,</b> usually made from wood, which serves as the template onto which the workpiece is formed (asymmetric shapes can be made, {{but it is a}} very advanced technique). For example, to make a sheet metal bowl, a solid block of wood {{in the shape of the}} bowl is required; similarly, to make a vase, a solid template of the vase is required.|$|R
40|$|Metal {{spinning}} {{technology has}} seen a rapid development in recent years. Novel spinning processes, such as non-axisymmetrical spinning, non-circular cross-section spinning and tooth-shaped spinning, are being developed. This has challenged the limitation of traditional spinning technology being used for manufacturing axisymmetrical, circular cross-section, and uniform wall-thickness parts. In this paper, the classification of the traditional spinning processes is proposed based on the material deformation characteristics, the relative position between roller and blank, <b>mandrel</b> <b>spinning</b> and mandrel-free spinning, and temperature of the blank during spinning. The advancement of recently developed novel spinning processes and corresponding tool design and equipment development are reviewed. The classification of the novel spinning processes is proposed based on the relative position between the rotating axes, the geometry of cross-section and the variation of wall-thickness of the spun parts. The material deformation mechanism, processing failures and spun part defects of the aforementioned three groups of novel spinning processes are discussed by analyzing four representative spinning processes of industrial applications. Furthermore, other novel spinning processes and their classification {{as reported in the}} literature are summarized. ...|$|R
5000|$|Prior to the UV curing and coating system, Coors used a {{conventional}} production method. The production line is similar, but a four-color offset printer is used and a blanket lays the image onto the can as it <b>spins</b> on a <b>mandrel.</b> The cans are {{pulled into a}} gas convention oven by pin chains to cure the inks and varnishes, which take [...] "12 seconds at 400 °F". Afterwards, an internal coating {{is applied to the}} cans and it is sent to another gas oven to be cured. Some of the problems using this thermal process of coating and curing includes: Speed of printing limited by length and speed of pin chain conveyors, high energy costs for gas ovens, and also the can coatings becoming non-functional, when they are overheated in the oven due to slow speed or stoppages. Also, the use of lubricants on the pin chains is kept to a minimum to prevent it from getting into the can. Because of this, pin chains [...] "wear excessively and break frequently". Before it can even be repaired, 20 minutes need to be spent to wait for the oven to cool down enough.|$|R
40|$|Hollow shape {{component}} approaches, {{applied to}} shafts and similar workpieces, represent a major potential for ground-breaking innovations in lightweight engineering and safety designs. Among suitable forming technologies, spin extrusion is a pioneering and particularly flexible hollow-shaping technique. All outside form elements, straight or stepped cylinders, cones or spherical rotation elements emerge {{just from the}} kinematics of tools. The inside hollow shapes, as e. g. circular cross-sections, shaft to collar connections such as spherical triangles, polygons, splines or dovetail forms are manufactured with a shaping <b>mandrel.</b> <b>Spin</b> extrusion can be applied first and foremost at dimensions that are unattainable with other techniques. The application includes hollow shafts, thick-walled cups and semi-finished tubular products that {{are not to be}} found in off-the-shelf cross-sections. In these cases the possibility for using of massive bars is connected with very high price advantages. Furthermore material-saving machining is attracting special attention for high-grade materials. The paper characterizes substantial steps of process analysis and the appliance of a new, derived from the bound method, numerical simulation method for spin extrusion process. Holistic process analysis is the prime factor for process capability. The specific application of the developed special methods of simulation, the accumulation of process data and the integrating into the Computer numerical control of spin extrusion machine is a precondition guaranteeing high-quality assurance...|$|R
40|$|Metal {{spinning}} is a {{sheet forming}} process to produce axisymmetric products, but its commercial operation still {{depends on a}} dedicated mandrel which determines {{the shape of the}} product, and skilled craftsmen to control the working tool. In Flexible Asymmetric <b>Spinning</b> (FAS) the <b>mandrel</b> is replaced with three numerically controlled internal rollers, thereby removing the setup time and cost associated with producing the dedicated mandrel. However, if FAS could also be automated, the setup time and cost could be reduced further. This thesis focuses on three elements which need to be in place for the automation of FAS: the automation of the internal rollers; compensation for springback; and toolpath design to prevent failure. Typically, automation requires a process model. To automate the internal rollers, a process model which predicts the effect of the internal roller position on the workpiece shape would be required – but as FAS is a novel process, no such models exist. To compensate for springback, a model of workpiece shape is required. To prevent failure, a model of the two modes of failure – wrinkling and tearing – is needed. For offline automation, these should be accurate models – but accurate models of both workpiece shape and failure are too slow to make this feasible. For online automation, fast, approximate models can be used – measurements of the product can be fed back in order to compensate for the model errors. However, a literature review showed that no models exist for workpiece shape or failure which are both fast enough for online use, and detailed enough to give information on how tool actions should be changed. This is why FAS has not yet been automated. In previous work, the internal rollers were positioned through trial-and-error and only a straightwalled cup was successfully produced. In this work, a laser line scanner is installed to measure the workpiece shape online, and one of the internal rollers is positioned {{at the point where the}} workpiece just begins to diverge from the target shape. This prevents overlap with the target shape, and allows a greater range of products to be made. Springback is typically prevented in conventional spinning by pressing the material hard against the mandrel. This is not possible in FAS due to the force limits on the internal tools. However, in FAS it is possible to move the working roller inside the target shape to compensate for springback. The laser line scanner is used to measure springback and calibrate a simple elastic cantilever model of springback online. By using this model to calculate how far to move the tool inside the target shape, springback errors are reduced by 75 %. Two approaches to toolpath design to avoid failure are investigated: Firstly, a finite horizon control system – where failure is checked for only for a short time into the future – is tentatively demonstrated using a slow but accurate finite element (FE) model, but this is too slow for industrial use. However, with a faster, linear-elastic model, the control system is too conservative and fails to produce the final product. Secondly, an empirical approach is investigated: a series of trials are carried out with a parameterised toolpath. The result is a tentative set of rules for toolpath design which may provide the basis for a future control system. Overall, this thesis makes steps towards the automation of internal rollers, compensation of springback, and design of toolpaths to prevent failure in FAS. With further work to extend the control system developed here to automate all three internal rollers and to verify the robustness of the springback compensation system, any conventional spinning machine could potentially be replaced by an FAS machine – with the toolpath of the working roller designed manually, as it currently is in conventional spinning. Yet the tentative sets of rules on toolpath design also open the door to a potential automatic toolpath generation system, and further work should begin by testing the robustness of these rules with changes in material and geometry. Then, with some likely extensions, they could be embedded into a working control system to fully automate FAS...|$|R
