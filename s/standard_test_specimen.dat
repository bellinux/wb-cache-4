40|$|Research {{to develop}} tests that can {{accurately}} predict {{the effects of}} deicing chemicals on the corrosion of steel in reinforced concrete structures is reported. The research includes the development and evaluation of a <b>standard</b> <b>test</b> <b>specimen</b> {{and the use of}} three deicing chemicals to determine the sensitivity of both corrosion potential and macrocell corrosion to molal ion con-centrations ranging from 0. 4 to 6. 4. The <b>standard</b> <b>test</b> <b>specimen</b> consists of a No. 4 reinforcing bar embedded in a 1. 18 in. (30 mm) diameter, 4 in. (100 mm) long mortar cylinder. The mortar is made using portland cement, deionized water, and standard graded Ottawa sand. Specimens cured in lime-saturated water reach a passive condition within 14 days. The tests are easy to perform, require no special training, and can normally be completed within 60 days. Of the two tests, the corrosion potential test provides more consistent results and should prove to be a useful tool for comparing the effects of deicing chemicals on the corrosion of reinforcing steel. Additional modifications are needed in the macrocell test before it is ready for general use. Based on limited test data using sodium chloride, calcium chloride, and calcium magnesium acetate, calcium chloride appears to be the most detrimental, followed in order by sodium chloride and calcium magnesium acetate. Corrosion in the presence of calcium magnesium acetate appears to be highly sensitive to relative concentration, with no corrosion occurring at a molal ion concentra-tion of 0. 4. In contrast, specimens exposed to both calcium chloride and sodium chloride exhibit measurable corrosion potential at a concentration of 0. 4 m. At the highest concentration for which comparisons were made (6. 4 m), both the CMA and the CaC 12 appear to be equally detrimental, while the NaCl appears to cause somewhat less corrosion. ...|$|E

The composites were prepared using Thermo Haake Polydrive internal mixer and then compression molded according to <b>standard</b> <b>test</b> <b>specimen.</b> Tensile and impact tests {{were performed to}} characterize the mechanical properties of untreated and treated composites. The obtained experimental values of Young’s modulus were then related to the theoretical predictions using a HalpinTsai equation. The theoretical prediction resulted in greater values of tensile modulus compared to the experimental values. A morphological study was done on the tensile fractured surface using a scanning electron microscopy. A Fourier transform infrared spectra analysis {{was performed on the}} composites to study the interaction between the polypropylene and functional group of stearic acid and vinyl silane.

The ASTM D 3165 <b>standard</b> <b>test</b> <b>specimen</b> geometry is followed for model development derivations.

The equivalent forces {{at the tip of the}} prescribed interlaminar crack are obtained based on interlaminar stress distributions.

40|$|Fused {{deposition}} modeling is one {{of rapid}} prototyping system that produces prototypes from plastic materials such as ABS (acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene) by laying the tracks of semi-molten plastic filament onto a platform in a layer-wise manner from bottom to top. The present work attempts experimental investigations to study influence of important process parameters viz., layer thickness, part orientation, raster angle, air gap and raster width along with their interactions on dimensional accuracy of Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) processed part. The part produced from FDM machine does not match with dimension of CAD model due to presence of shrinkage. However, shrinkage is more prominent in length and width direction but a positive deviation is observed in thickness direction. It is essential to study the effect of each parameter on responses such as percentage change in length, width, and thickness of specimen. A design of experiment (DOE) is used to study the effect of process parameters on responses. Optimum parameters setting to minimize percentage change in length, width and thickness of <b>standard</b> <b>test</b> <b>specimen</b> have been found out using Taguchi’s parameter design.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyThe {{commercial}} {{introduction of}} glass infiltrated slip cast ceramic technology as a core dental ceramic for crowns and bridges began in 1990. The system known as Inceram® provided a metal free ceramic core with a flexural strength that {{was reported to}} be between 400 and 600 MPa. The first aim {{of this study was to}} investigate in vitro fractures for this type of crown that occurred from high localized occlusal loading. The second aim was to propose suitable guidelines for the construction of crowns that are more crack resistant when loaded by a spherical object such as an opposinc cusp. The review of the literature identified Young’s modulus (E) as an important aspect for the behaviour of a brittle solid when it is exposed to load. Young’s modulus is involved in the total energy of the solid, its free surface energy, its toughness, parameters involved in contact areas, stresses from indenters on those contact areas and at the interface between two materials with different moduli. This mismatch was to become more important when Finite Element Analysis was applied to the test results. A second physical property that has importance in bilaminar minerals is Poisson’s ratio. Less important than Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio still provides some of the answers to crack propagation at an interface, highlighted by the description of Dundurs parameters (Mencik 1996). The use of Weibull statistics provided information concerning reliability for different core to veneer thickness ratios in the experimental models and crown designs. The first experimental part was to establish a crown model suitable for investigation. The porcelain jacked crown restoration for an upper incisor was chosen because it provided the best opportunity to vary the construction parameters of the crown without sacrificing the aesthetics. The results from this initial in vitro study established thickness ranges for the standard design of these crowns, the loads that could be expected and the two types of fracture patterns that might occur when the bilaminar system is loaded via a hard steel ball indenter in the middle of the palatal surface. The data from chapter three were then compared with two basic bilaminar and monolithic disc designs to establish the relevance of the dimensions of the ISO <b>standard</b> <b>test</b> <b>specimen</b> design for flexural strength. The results of this chapter confirmed that the loads were in the same range for the bilaminate discs, and that the flexural strengths for the two component parts were in agreement with other known results. The use of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was employed to provide an additional method for testing the model to establish areas when principal stresses might lie and how they were distributed. It was found that the ISO flexural strength test was not ideal for testing bilaminates because it did not account for the large mismatch in Young’s modulus between the two component materials. The FEA revealed an unexpected increase in tensile stress on the bottom surface of the In-Ceram when it was the bottom layer in the bilaminate. The FEA did confirm the difference between a flat punch and a ball indenter for stress intensities around the contact area with the ball indenter producing higher stresses for a given load...|$|E

40|$|Numerous {{investigations}} on corrosion and {{corrosion protection}} of steel in concrete {{have been carried}} out until today. However, most of these studies are almost limited in the field of materials engineering, for example, main subjects are as follows. 1) Mechanics and mechanisms of steel corrosion, and evaluation of corrosion data. 2) Corrosion monitoring in field structures and corrosion protection. 3) Prediction of service life and repair methods. On the other hand, the influence of corrosion on flexural, shear and bond strength of reinforced concrete members has been discussed on beams and floor slabs. Japan is located in the seismic hazard zoning area. Therefore, in this paper the damage affecting aseismatic behavior of reinforced concrete structural members due to corrosion of steel reinforcing bars is discussed through experiments under the constant axial load and alternately repeated lateral loads. As the first step, structural walls were adopted as the test specimens. Because the coverage thickness, namely, the concrete protective covering for reinforcement is small and the corrosion area is large for reinforcing bars in structural walls. Furthermore, a new fiber reinforced composite material (NFM) instead of steel bars was used in order to investigate durability of the structural walls under chroride attack environment in the semitropical region. A wall panel size was 800 x 950 mm and its thickness was 80 mm. The rigid edge beams were attached to {{the top and bottom of}} the wall panel. The shear-span ratio M/Qd was 1. 43. The weight of a test specimen was about 1 tonf. The reinforcing bars, whose diameter was 6 mm, were arranged as likely mesh by double layered reinforcement. The reinforcement ratio of the wall panel was 0. 8 %. In order to prevent from corrosion, epoxy coated steel bars were used in the top and bottom rigid edge beams. These test specimens were offered to the electrolytic corrosion test and exposure test in high salty environment in the semitropical and marine region at the coast in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. The concrete cylinder average strength was about 250 kgf/cm^ 2. The 11 test specimens were provided. The 8 ones contained the soldium chloride solution (NaCl 3. 3 % sol.). Now, among them the 6 test specimens, in which the 3 NFM test specimens are included, are exposed at the coast in Okinawa. These exposed test specimens will be loaded laterally by a set of hydraulic jacks after one or several years. The other 5 test specimens were tested under the constant gravity load and alternately repeated lateral forces. One of them was the <b>standard</b> <b>test</b> <b>specimen.</b> The 2 specimens were arranged by the new fiber reinforced composite mesh. An electrolytic corrosion test was applied to the other 2 specimens with the steel reinforcing bars contained the soldium chloride solution. In this case, a steel mesh wrapped in gelatin was adopted as an electrode. This electrode was the same size as a wall panel and was attached on it. The loading apparatus was a cantilever type. As a result of this experimental investigation, the following conclusions were obtained. 1) The failure mode of normal test specimen was a flexural compressive failure type. The maximum lateral capacity was kept until a drift ratio reached approximately 1. 0 %. Then some loss of the lateral load due to the crushing at the bottom corner of the wall panel occurred gradually. 2) The ultimate lateral load of test specimens with electrochemical corrosion damages was obtained after the drift ratio reached over 0. 5 %. Especially. the ultimate loads were almost same regardless of corrosion damages. The cover concrete at the neighborhood of the bottom of wall panel spalled off and the buckling of the longitudinal reinforcing bars was observed at conclusion of loading. These test specimens, whose failure mode was similar to the brittle shear failure, resulted in the significant deterioration of the ductility. 3) The ultimate lateral load of the test specimens, which were arranged by the new fiber reinforced composite material (NFM), was superior to the other test specimens with reinforcing steel bars. After drift ratio reached over 1. 0 %, the reinforcing bars made of NFM were partially broken. And the degradation of the lateral load capacity was observed in the hysteretic loops. The energy absorption capacity of these test specimens was slightly smaller than the other specimens because of lacking of the plastic range for the NFM. However, the durability of these test specimens will be expected in chloride attack environment...|$|E

The investigation revealed that the presence of cracks shallower than 0. 2 mm is worse on the fracture strain of the wire...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{combined}} node searching algorithm for simulation of crack discontinuities in meshless methods called combined visibility and surrounding triangles (CVT) is proposed. The element free Galerkin (EFG) method is employed for stress analysis of cracked bodies. The proposed node searching algorithm {{is based on}} the combination of surrounding triangles and visibility methods; the surrounding triangles method is used for support domains of nodes and quadrature points generated at the vicinity of crack faces and the visibility method is used for points located on the crack faces. In comparison with the conventional methods, such as the visibility, the transparency, and the diffraction method, this method is simpler with reasonable efficiency. To show the performance of this method, linear elastic fracture mechanics analyses are performed on number of <b>standard</b> <b>test</b> <b>specimens</b> and stress intensity factors are calculated. It is shown that the results are in good agreement with the exact solution and with those generated by the finite element method (FEM) ...|$|R

The damaged injection mold has cracks induced by laser surface heat treatment. <b>Standard</b> <b>test</b> <b>specimens</b> were injection molded, commonly used for examining the shrinkage behavior of various thermoplastic materials. The measured AE burst signals during injection molding cycle are presented. For injection molding tool integrity prediction, different AE burst signals’ descriptors are defined. To lower computational complexity and increase performance, the feature selection method was implemented {{to define a}} feature subset in an appropriate multidimensional space to characterize {{the integrity of the}} injection molding tool and the injection molding process steps. The feature subset was used for neural network pattern recognition of AE signals during the full time of the injection molding cycle. The results confirm that acoustic emission measurement during injection molding of polymer materials is a promising technique for characterizing the integrity of molds with respect to damage, even with resonant sensors...|$|R
40|$|The {{behavior}} of part-through flaws {{with regard to}} failure under monotonic loading and their growth under fatigue loading was investigated experimentally and analytically. The objective {{of this paper is}} to present comparisons of experimental values of toughness obtained using surface- and corner-cracked specimens with those obtained using <b>standard</b> <b>test</b> <b>specimens,</b> and also to compare experimental growth cycles with numerical predictions using the NASA/FLAGRO computer program. Tests were conducted on various types of surface and corner cracks under tensile and bending loads. Room temperature laboratory air provided the test environment. The material used in this investigation was the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy in the solution treated and aged (STA) and stress-relieved condition. Detailed tabulation of the fracture toughness data and results of life prediction using the NASA/FLAGRO program are presented. Fatigue crack growth rates for the part-through-cracked specimens are compared with a base curve fitted from the data obtained using standard specimens. The fatigue loading used in the crack growth testing was of constant-amplitude sinusoidal type...|$|R
40|$|A failure model which {{considers}} the stochastic {{nature of the}} damage accumulation process is essential to assess reliability and to accurately scale the results from <b>standard</b> <b>test</b> <b>specimens</b> to composite structures. A superior filamentary composite for high temperature applications is composed of carbon fibers in a carbon matrix. Carbon-carbon composites are the strongest known material at very high temperatures. Since {{there appears to be}} a significant randomness in C-C material strength which cannot be controlled or detected with current technology, a better model of the material failure based upon statistical principles should be used. Simple applications of the model based upon the limited data provide encouraging results that indicate that better design of <b>test</b> <b>specimens</b> would provide a substantially higher prediction for the design strength of C-C composites. An A-basis strength for the C-C tensile rings from a first stage D- 5 billets was estimated. A statistical failure model was developed for these rings which indicates that this strength may be very conservative for larger C-C parts. The analysis may be improved by use of a heterogeneous/noncontinuum finite element approach on the minimechanical level...|$|R

40|$|ERAF: 48421 This review swnmaries tests {{which have}} been used to define the fire {{performance}} of combustible materials including plastics. Many of the small scale tests are intended to classify the characteristics of materials in the form of small <b>standard</b> <b>test</b> <b>specimens</b> and seem to bear little relationship to the final application (see ASTM D 635 BS 2782 Method 50 BA, ASTM 1929 etc.). Other <b>tests</b> expose a <b>standard</b> <b>specimen</b> to conditions which might prevail in the application (see BS 476 Part 1, BS 476 Part 6 globar, electrical spark ignition test etc.). The multiplicity of tests reflects efforts to develop relevant procedures but they often suggest a lack of co-ordination or a psychological need for the developers to make their mark - note the series of tests ASTM D 635, BS 2782 Method 50 BA, BS 3532 etc. At RAPRA the fire performance of plastics is being studied using <b>standard</b> <b>tests</b> and non-standard environmental tests. This review was prepared as part of a consideration of "relevant" tests and to establish what procedures were already available. An attempt has been made to group tests into a logical order but this has not been possible throughout because of some multiple purpose tests. Where available tests,for smoke and toxic combustion products have been included. Reference is made to published environmental tests but it is not suggested that these are sensible <b>standard</b> classification <b>tests...</b>|$|R
