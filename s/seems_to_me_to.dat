5|$|The {{performance}} of Rebecca <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> have taken us {{further into the}} danger area instead of showing any improvement. I am unable to defend {{at a time when}} departmental costs and scene loads are in an acute state the load imposed by Rebecca on Design and Supply and the expenditure upon extras and costumes... the vast area of the hall and the stairway never justified the great expenditure of effort required in building and one is left with a very clear impression of reaching a point where the department must be accused of not knowing what it is doing.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} the {{experiment}} <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> render the adoption of Fresnel's hypothesis necessary, {{or at least the}} law which he found for the expression of the alteration of the velocity of light by the effect of motion of a body; for although that law being found true may be a very strong proof in favour of the hypothesis of which it is only a consequence, perhaps the conception of Fresnel may appear so extraordinary, and in some respects so difficult, to admit, that other proofs and a profound examination on the part of geometricians will still be necessary before adopting it as an expression of the real facts of the case.|$|E
25|$|The {{author of}} the 'Vestiges of Creation' would, I presume, say that, after a certain unknown number of generations, some bird {{had given birth to}} a woodpecker, and some plant to the mistletoe, and that these had been {{produced}} perfect as we now see them; but this assumption <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be no explanation, for it leaves the case of the coadaptations of organic beings {{to each other and to}} their physical conditions of life, untouched and unexplained.|$|E

25|$|Someone {{from whom}} I feel ever more distant is Juan Gris. I admire him but I cannot {{understand}} why he wears himself out with decomposing objects. Myself, I am advancing towards synthetic unity and I don't analyze any more.

Ah those stuffed tomatoes of all the St-Pol-Roux of painting.|$|E
25|$|Many {{scholars}} {{believe the}} individual Psalms were redacted {{into a single}} collection in Second-Temple times. It had long been recognized that the collection bore the imprint of an underlying message or metanarrative, but that this message remained concealed, as Augustine of Hippo said, 'The sequence of the Psalms <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> contain the secret of a mighty mystery, but its meaning has not been revealed to me.' (Enarr. on Ps. 150.1) Others pointed out the presence of concatenation, that is, adjacent Psalms sharing similar words and themes. In time, this approach developed into recognizing overarching themes shared by whole groups of psalms.|$|E
500|$|The opera was {{perceived}} to have weaknesses of characterization. For example, Robert's dithering behaviour led to one comment that [...] "what is least diabolical in Robert le diable is Robert himself." [...] But the critic FÃ©tis gave the consensus opinion: [...] "Robert le diable {{is not only}} a masterpiece; it is also a remarkable work within the history of music ... <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> unite all the qualities needed to establish a composer's reputation unshakeably." ...|$|E

500|$|In Memphis, Stax Records {{produced}} recordings by soul pioneers Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, and Don Covay. Other Stax {{artists such}} as Eddie Floyd and Johnnie Taylor also {{made significant contributions to}} soul music. By 1968, the soul music movement had begun to splinter, as James Brown and Sly & the Family Stone began to expand upon and abstract both soul and rhythm and blues into other forms. Guralnick wrote that more [...] "than anything else ... what <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> have brought the era of soul to a grinding, unsettling halt was the death of Martin Luther King in April 1968".|$|E
500|$|In 1909, Beecham {{conducted}} the first complete performance of A Mass of Life, {{the largest and}} most ambitious of Delius's concert works, written for four soloists, a double choir, and a large orchestra. Although the work was based on the same Nietzsche work as Richard Strauss's Also sprach Zarathustra, Delius distanced himself from the Strauss work, which he considered a complete failure. Nor was Strauss an admirer of Delius, as he was of Elgar; he told Delius that he did not wish to conduct Paris: [...] "the symphonic development <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be too scant, and it seems moreover to be an imitation of Charpentier".|$|E
500|$|Although Either/Or was Kierkegaard's {{first major}} book, {{it was one}} of his last books to be {{translated}} into English, as late as 1944. Frederick DeW. Bolman, Jr. insisted that reviewers consider the book in this way: [...] "In general, {{we have a right to}} discover, if we can, the meaning of a work as comprehensive as Either/Or, considering it upon its own merits and not reducing the meaning so as to fit into the author's later perspective. It occurred to me that this was a service to understanding Kierkegaard, whose esthetic and ethical insights have been much slighted by those enamored of his religion of renunciation and transcendence. ... Kierkegaard's brilliance <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be showing that while goodness, truth, and beauty can not speculatively be derived one from another, yet these three are integrally related in the dynamics of a healthy character structure".|$|E

500|$|The {{danger is}} perhaps not great if the people of one State, through their legislature, decide that Lady Chatterley's Lover goes so far beyond the {{acceptable}} standards of candor {{that it will be}} deemed offensive and non-sellable, for the State next door is still free to make its own choice. At least we do not have one uniform standard. But the dangers to free thought and expression are truly great if the Federal Government imposes a blanket ban over the Nation on such a book. [...] The fact that the people of one State cannot read some of the works of D. H. Lawrence seems to me, if not wise or desirable, at least acceptable. But that no person in the United States should be allowed to do so <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be intolerable, and violative of both the letter and spirit of the First Amendment.|$|E
500|$|Extant {{biographies of}} Epaminondas universally {{describe}} {{him as one of}} the most talented generals ever produced by the Greek city-states. Even Xenophon, who fails to note his presence at Leuctra, says of his Mantinean campaign: [...] "Now I for my part could not say that his campaign proved fortunate; yet of all possible deeds of forethought and daring the man <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> have left not one undone." [...] Diodorus is effusive in his praise for Epaminondas's military record: [...] "For it seems to me that he surpassed his contemporaries...in skill and experience in the art of war. For among the generation of Epaminondas were famous men: Pelopidas the Theban, [...] Timotheus and Conon, also Chabrias and Iphicrates...Agesilaus the Spartan, who belonged to a slightly older generation. Still earlier than these, in the times of the Medes and Persians, there were Solon, Themistocles, Miltiades, and Cimon, Myronides, and Pericles and certain others in Athens, and in Sicily Gelon, son of Deinomenes, and still others. All the same, if you should compare the qualities of these with the generalship and reputation of Epaminondas, you would find the qualities possessed by Epaminondas far superior".|$|E
500|$|Harold Pinter {{earned a}} {{reputation}} for being notoriously pugnacious, enigmatic, taciturn, terse, prickly, explosive and forbidding. Pinter's blunt political statements, and the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature, elicited strong criticism and even, at times, provoked ridicule and personal attacks. [...] The historian Geoffrey Alderman, author of the official history of Hackney Downs School, expressed his own [...] "Jewish View" [...] of Harold Pinter: [...] "Whatever his merit as a writer, actor and director, on an ethical plane Harold Pinter <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> have been intensely flawed, and his moral compass deeply fractured." [...] David Edgar, writing in The Guardian, defended Pinter against what he termed Pinter's [...] "being berated by the belligerati" [...] like Johann Hari, who felt that he did not [...] "deserve" [...] to win the Nobel Prize. [...] Later Pinter continued to campaign against the Iraq War and on behalf of other political causes that he supported. [...] As Alderman points out, for example, Pinter signed the mission statement of Jews for Justice for Palestinians in 2005 and its full-page advertisement, [...] "What Is Israel Doing? A Call by Jews in Britain", published in The Times on 6 July 2006, and he was a patron of the Palestine Festival of Literature.|$|E

500|$|Bono {{agreed to}} Carter's request without asking {{the rest of}} the band, and when {{informed}} of the idea, the other members gave only tacit approval. They briefly considered playing an impromptu concert in the city, with Bono suggesting that they perform in the bunker where Carter and his friends hid during the siege. He said, [...] "even if all we get is some extra attention for Bosnia on MTV, that's something". The idea fell through when it was pointed out that the logistics of transporting their equipment into the city were impossible, as the only way into Sarajevo was on a United Nations plane. Manager Paul McGuinness realized that even if the band managed to organize a concert, it would endanger their lives and those of the audience and the Zoo TV crew. As he explained, [...] "U2's effort to discuss any humanitarian issue have sometimes been accompanied by a false instinct that U2 is also obliged to resolve that issue. Going to Sarajevo <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> fall into that category. I think it would endanger the people we go with, endanger the tour, and endanger the band." [...] Drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. feared that the move would look like a publicity stunt.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} reviews were more {{critical}} of Haggard's work. Although the reviewer of She in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine considered it better than King Solomon's Mines, he opined, [...] "Mr. Rider Haggard has not proved as yet that he has {{anything that can be}} called imagination at all... It might be wrought up into an unparalleled stage effect: but it is rather a failure in pen and ink. The more fearful and wonderful such circumstances are intended to be, the more absurd is the failure of them". Even more scathing was Augustus Moore in the May edition of Time: A Monthly Miscellany, who declared: [...] "In Mr Haggard's book I find none of the powerful imagination, the elaborate detail, the vivid English which would entitle his work to be described as a romance... it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be the method of the modern melodrama". Moore was particularly dismissive of the novel's style and prose: [...] "Mr Haggard cannot write English at all. I do not merely refer to his bad grammar, which a boy at a Boarding School would deserve to be birched for... It can only have been written by a man who not only knew nothing, but cared nothing for 'English undefiled'." [...] Haggard's English was a common source of criticisms, but Moore was even dismissive of the character of She who widely garnered universal praise. [...] "Ayesha", Moore declares, [...] "is about as impressive as the singing chambermaid who represents the naughty fairy of a pantomime in tights and a tow wig". Concluding his review, Moore wondered at the success that had greeted She: ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} is quite dark and mysterious, {{as much of it}} is often {{interpreted}} to be dealing with issues such as substance abuse, suicide, and depression, with running themes of revenge, annihilation, seclusion, fear, loss, death, and discovery. Cornell was inspired by the writings of Sylvia Plath at the time. Commenting on the album's lyrics, Thayil said that [...] "a lot of Superunknown <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be about life, not death. Maybe not affirming it, but rejoicingâlike the Druids : 'Life is good, but death's gonna be even better!" [...] Cameron said that the lyrics on the album are [...] "a big fuck-you to the world, a plea to 'leave us alone. Cornell stated that [...] "Let Me Drown" [...] is about [...] "crawling back to the womb to die", [...] "Fell on Black Days" [...] is about realizing [...] "you're unhappy in the extreme", [...] "Black Hole Sun" [...] is about a [...] "surreal dreamscape", [...] "Limo Wreck" [...] is a [...] "'shame-on-decadence' song", [...] "The Day I Tried to Live" [...] is about [...] "trying to step out of being patterned and closed off and reclusive", and [...] "4th of July" [...] is about using LSD. Cornell talked about [...] "Mailman" [...] at a concert saying, [...] "This next one is about killing your boss. It's about coming to work early one morning cause you have a special agenda and you're going to shoot him in the fucking head." [...] Conversely, [...] "Like Suicide" [...] was literal, written by Cornell after a bird flew into a window of his house. He found the severely injured animal and killed it, hitting it with a brick to end its suffering.|$|E
