500|$|The second-tier {{defendants}} had {{a difficult}} time finding lawyers to represent them. The five defense attorneys at the 1949 trial had been jailed for contempt of court, and two of them, Abraham J. Isserman and Harry Sacher, were disbarred. Attorneys for other Smith Act defendants routinely found themselves attacked by courts, attorneys' groups, and licensing boards, leading many defense attorneys to shun Smith Act cases. Auerbach , p 245–248. [...] Rabinowitz, Victor, A History of the National Lawyers Guild: 1937–1987, National Lawyers Guild Foundation, 1987, p 28. Some defendants were forced to contact over one hundred attorneys before finding one that would accept; defendant Steve Nelson could not find a lawyer in Pennsylvania who would represent him in his Smith Act trial, so he was compelled to represent himself; and judges sometimes had to appoint unwilling counsel for defendants who could not find a lawyer to take the case.

In this capacity, some later-model cassette-based dictation machines could also run the tape at half speed (15⁄16 in/s) as playback quality was not critical.

2500|$|The President {{possesses}} the following powers exercised [...] "in his absolute discretion" [...] {{according to the}} English version of the Constitution. [...] The Irish version states that these powers are exercised as a chomhairle féin which is usually translated as [...] "under his own counsel." [...] Lawyers have suggested that a conflict may exist in this case between both versions of the constitution. In {{the event of a}} clash between the Irish and English versions of the constitution, the Irish one is given supremacy. While [...] "absolute discretion" [...] appears to leave some freedom for manoeuvre for a president in deciding whether to initiate contact with the opposition, [...] "own counsel" [...] has been interpreted by <b>some</b> <b>lawyers</b> as suggesting that no contact whatsoever can take place. As a result, it is considered controversial for the president to be contacted by the leaders of any political parties in an effort to influence a decision made using the discretionary powers. It is required that, before exercising certain reserve powers, the President consult the Council of State. However, the President is not compelled to act in accordance with the council's advice.|$|E
2500|$|Since 1866 Chilean {{entrepreneurs}} José Santos Ossa and Francisco Puelma exploited {{deposits of}} sodium nitrate in Bolivian territories (salitreras [...] "Las Salinas" [...] and [...] "Carmen Alto" [...] and [...] from Antofagasta respectively) secured by concessions from the then President of Bolivia Mariano Melgarejo. Later, in 1868, British capital was associated and founded the Compañía Melbourne Clark.

The company was established in Valparaíso, Chile. Its shareholders included a number of leading Chilean politicians. In 1871 a new Bolivian Government invalidated all contracts signed by Melgarejo. But on 22 November 1872 a Bolivian decree allowed the government to renegotiate the contracts, {{which is what the}} company and the Bolivian Government did. On 27 November 1873 the CSFA obtained from the Bolivian executive a license to exploit saltpeter duty-free for 15 years, but it was disputed whether the decree needed the authorization of the Bolivian Congress. <b>Some</b> <b>lawyers</b> placed emphasis on con cargo a dar cuenta a la próxima legislatura (Spanish for: [...] "to be accepted by the parliament"), while others on sólo en los casos de no avenimiento (Spanish for [...] "only in conflict cases").|$|E

2500|$|Shortly before Rodriguez, the Supreme Court {{had held}} in another {{arbitration}} case, Volt Information Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior University, that parties could, in their contracts, deviate from {{the terms of}} the FAA. They could specify when and where the arbitration could take place, and who could do it. <b>Some</b> <b>lawyers,</b> mindful of the unsettled debate over manifest disregard, began drafting contracts whose arbitration clauses provided for a more clearly defined standard of judicial review. That raised the question of whether parties could require more of judges than the FAA did. In 1995 the Fifth Circuit decided that the Supreme Court's pro-arbitration decisions from Moses Cone onwards required that they enforce the contract as written in Gateway Technologies, Inc. v. MCI Telecommunications Corp. Two years later the Ninth Circuit followed suit in LaPine Technology Corp. v. Kyocera Corp., where Judge Ferdinand Fernandez writing for the panel that [...] "the FAA is not an [...] designed to avert overburdened court dockets; it is designed to avert interference with the contractual rights of the parties." [...] Alex Kozinski concurred, but with the caveat that [...] "Nowhere has Congress authorized courts to review arbitral awards under the standard the parties here adopted." [...] He joined Fernandez only because [...] "The review to which the parties have agreed is no different from that performed by the district courts in appeals from administrative agencies and bankruptcy courts, or on habeas corpus. I would call the case differently if the agreement provided that the district judge would review the award by flipping a coin or studying the entrails of a dead fowl." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{process was}} humiliating for the (grand)mothers {{who had to}} declare in court that they had {{committed}} adultery. The petitions were successful {{in the majority of}} cases. The high success rate was a result of several factors. First, <b>some</b> <b>lawyers</b> specialised in such procedures, prepared them professionally, and refused hopeless cases. There was no danger in the procedures because failure did not downgrade the classification of the litigant. Second, usually all the family members cooperated; including the sometimes still-living disputed (grand)father. Likely alternative fathers were often named, who either appeared themselves in court confirming their likely fatherhood, or who were already dead but were known as good friends, neighbours, or subtenants of the (grand)mother. Third, the obligatory and humiliating body examinations of those under suspicion were skewed by stereotypical Jewish perceptions. Expert witnesses would search for allegedly Jewish facial features, as conceived and understood by anti-Semites. If the doubted (grand)father was already dead, emigrated, or deported (as after 1941), the examination searched for these supposedly [...] "Jewish" [...] features in the physiognomy of the descendant (child). Since anti-Semitic clichés on Jewish outward appearance were so stereotyped, the average litigant did not show features clearly indicating their Jewish descent, so they often documented ambiguous results as medical evidence. Fourth, the judges tended to believe the accounts of the (grand)mothers, alternative fathers, doubted fathers, and other witnesses who had endured such public humiliation. They were not recorded for earlier perjuring, and judges would declare the prior paternity annulled, ensuring the status improvement for the litigant.1999), Hamburg: Dölling und Galitz, 22002, Studien zur jüdischen Geschichte; vol. 6, simultaneously Hamburg, Univ., Diss., 1998, , especially chapter 'III.
