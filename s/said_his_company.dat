500|$|Wired said Kaspersky's critics {{accuse him}} of using the company to spy on users for Russian intelligence. Russian {{telecommunications}} companies for example are required by federal law in Russia {{to cooperate with the}} government's military and spy operations if asked. Kaspersky <b>said</b> <b>his</b> <b>company</b> has never been asked to tamper with its software for espionage and called the accusations [...] "cold war paranoia." [...] According to Wired, Kaspersky staffers argue [...] "not unconvincingly" [...] that spying on users would hurt its business and its relationship with the Russian FSB, the KGB's successor, is limited. According to Gartner, [...] "There's no evidence that they have any back doors in their software or any ties to the Russian mafia or state... but there is still a concern that you can’t operate in Russia without being controlled by the ruling party.” Computing mocked some of the more extreme accusations of espionage, but said it would be unlikely for a Russian business to grow to the size of Kaspersky Lab without relationships within the Russian government. NPR journalists also said it was unlikely Kaspersky was using its software for espionage, because it would be risky for the company's business, but said Kaspersky showed an unusual disinterest in Russia-based cybercrime.|$|E
