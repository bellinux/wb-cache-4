A PC radio may not have a front-panel at all, and may be designed exclusively for computer control, which reduces cost.

Spreadsheets in paper format have been used by accountants for hundreds of years. However, computerized, {{electronic spreadsheet}}s are of much more recent origin. In 1961, Richard Mattessich, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley, pioneered the concept of electronic spreadsheets for use in business accounting.
