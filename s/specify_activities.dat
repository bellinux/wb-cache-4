40|$|We {{propose that}} {{recommendations}} {{in a clinical}} guideline can be structured either as collections of decisions {{that are to be}} applied in specific situations or as processes that <b>specify</b> <b>activities</b> that take place over time. We formalize them as "recommendation sets" consisting of either Activity Graphs that represent guideline-directed processes or Decision Maps that represent atemporal recommendations or recommendations involving decisions made at one time point. We model guideline processes as specializations of workflow processes and provide possible computational models for decision maps. We evaluate the proposed formalism by showing how various guideline-modeling methodologies, including GLIF, EON, PRODIGY 3, and Medical Logic Modules can be mapped into the proposed structures. The generality of the formalism makes it a candidate for standardizing the structure of recommendations for computerinterpretable guidelines...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{personalization}} {{of learning}} remains {{a major challenge}} for re- search in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). We report in this article how we used the Adapte tool to make AMBRE-add adaptive. AMBRE-add is an ITS designed to teach a problem solving method. This ITS includes a module that analyzes the learner’s activity traces in order to compute a learner profile. Furthermore a problem generator enables us to <b>specify</b> <b>activities</b> proposed to the student. In order to design an automated process of personalizing activities according to the learner profile, we used the Adapte system. This is a generic system enabling {{the definition of a}} personalization strategy and its application to an external ITS.

40|$|There is now {{a growing}} need to {{identify}} various kinds of activities that occur in videos. In this paper, we first present a logical language called Probabilistic Activity Description Language (PADL) in which users can <b>specify</b> <b>activities</b> of interest. We then develop a probabilistic framework which assigns to any subvideo of a given video sequence a probability that the subvideo contains the given activity, and we finally develop two fast algorithms to detect activities within this framework. OffPad finds all minimal segments of a video that contain a given activity with a probability exceeding a given threshold. In contrast, the OnPad algorithm examines a video during playout (rather than afterwards as OffPad does) and computes {{the probability that a}} given activity is occurring (even if the activity is only partially complete). Our prototype Probabilistic Activity Detection System (PADS) implements the framework and the two algorithms, building on top of existing image processing algorithms. We have conducted detailed experiments and compared our approach to four different approaches presented in the literature. We show that-for complex activity definitions-our approach outperforms all the other approaches...|$|E
40|$|Today’s {{companies}} {{are able to}} automate the enforcement of Environmental, Health and Safety (EH&S) duties {{through the use of}} workflow management technology. This approach requires to <b>specify</b> <b>activities</b> that are combined to workflow models for EH&S enforcement duties. In order to meet given safety regulations these activities are to be completed correctly and within given deadlines. Otherwise, activity failures emerge which may lead to breaches against safety regulations. A novel domain-specific workflow meta data model is proposed. The model enables a system to detect and predict activity failures through the use of data about the company, failure statistics, and activity proxies. Since the detection and prediction methods are based on the evaluation of constraints specified on EH&S regulations, a system approach is proposed that builds on the integration of a Workflow Management System (WMS) with an EH&S Compliance Information System. Main principles of the failure detection and prediction are described. For EH&S managers the system shall provide insights into the current failure situation. This can help to prevent and mitigate critical situations such as safety enforcement measures that are behind their deadlines. As a result a more reliable enforcement of safety regulations can be achieved...|$|E
40|$|MOTIVATION: The Dam methyltransferase (DamMT) activity, broadly {{distributed}} {{in association with}} restriction endonucleases, {{as part of the}} restriction-modification defense systems, has evolved to become intimately associated with essential biological functions in a few organisms. In Escherichia coli, DamMT is involved in multiple aspects of DNA maintenance, replication initiation, daughter chromosome segregation, DNA mismatch repair, gene expression control, etc. The participation of DamMT in such a diverse set of functions required that other genes adapted, or emerged through evolution, in response to the DamMT-induced modification of the genomic environment. One example is SeqA, a protein that senses the methylation status of the origin of replication of the chromosome to control the timing of replication initiation. Interestingly, seqA is only present in a few DamMT-specifying proteobacteria. This observation led us to hypothesize that other genes, specifying related functions, might also be found in these organisms. To test this hypothesis, we implemented a large-scale comparative genomic screen meant to identify genes specifying DNA methylation sensing domains, probably involved in DNA maintenance functions. RESULTS: We carried out a phylogenetic analysis of DamMT, identifying two contrasting behaviors of the protein. Based on this phylogeny, we defined precisely a set of genomes, in which the protein activity is likely to be involved in DNA maintenance functions, the 'resident' dam genomes. We defined a second set of genomes, in which DamMT is not resident. We developped a new tool, 'DomainSieve', in order to screen these two sets for protein domains that are strictly associated with 'resident' dam genomes. This approach was rewarding and generated a list of genes, among which some, at least, <b>specify</b> <b>activities</b> with clear linkage to DamMT-dependent DNA methylation and DNA maintenance. AVAILABILITY: DomainSieve is implemented as a web resource and is accessible at [URL]...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{develop a}} web service for route finding in OpenStreetMap (OSM) {{following}} an activity-centred approach: {{the aim is}} not only to assist the user in travelling from A to B, but also to perform a series of <b>specified</b> <b>activities</b> along the way. This is particularly important e. g. for electric mobility, where activities can take place while the battery of the car is recharging. For <b>specifying</b> <b>activities,</b> our tool uses an ontology of spatially-located activities. This ontology then needs to be related to OSM which provides semantic metadata in form of tags. We organised the tags into another ontology (which is then connected to the first one via an ontology mapping), providing thus not only better reference for the OSM community, but also allowing to enrich the ontological semantics of the tags, to deal with their evolving nature and to extract implicit information using ontologybased data access. Moreover, we report first results on an ongoing query corpus experiment involving the OSM community targeted at improving the automated understanding of free text input for certain route finding tasks. ...|$|R
