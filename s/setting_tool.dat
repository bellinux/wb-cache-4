5000|$|Setting {{tools are}} used to set {{downhole}} completion elements such as production packers or bridge plugs. Setting tools typically use the expanding gas energy from a slow burning explosive charge to drive a hydraulic piston assembly. The assembly {{is attached to the}} plug or packer by means of a setting mandrel and a sliding sleeve, which when [...] "stroked" [...] by the piston assembly, effectively squeezes the elastomer elements of the packing element, deforming it sufficiently to wedge it into place in the tubing or casing string. Most completion packers or plugs have a specially designed shear mechanism which release the <b>setting</b> <b>tool</b> from the element allowing it to be retrieved back to surface. The packer/plug however, remains down hole as a barrier to isolate production zones or permanently plug off a well bore.|$|E
50|$|A drive rivet {{is a form}} {{of blind}} rivet that has a short mandrel {{protruding}} from the head that is driven in with a hammer to flare out the end inserted in the hole. This is commonly used to rivet wood panels into place since the hole {{does not need to be}} drilled all the way through the panel, producing an aesthetically pleasing appearance. They can also be used with plastic, metal, and other materials and require no special <b>setting</b> <b>tool</b> other than a hammer and possibly a backing block (steel or some other dense material) placed behind the location of the rivet while hammering it into place. Drive rivets have less clamping force than most other rivets. Drive screws, possibly another name for drive rivets, are commonly used to hold nameplates into blind holes. They typically have spiral threads that grip the side of the hole.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} formal {{definition}} of design problem using the axiomatic theory of design modeling. Based {{on the concept}} of product system and an informal description of design problem, a design problem is formulated into three parts: environment, structural requirements, as well as performance requirements. On the basis of this formulation, both structural requirements and performance requirements are related to product environment, which is divided into natural, built, and human environments. As a result, product environment is identified as the source of product requirements. An environment-based formulation of design problem is thus developed. This formulation implies that both design problem and design solutions are included in a product system. The design governing equation is formulated to capture the interdependence relation between product problem and product descriptions along the design process.

40|$|Abstract. Usability {{goals are}} often the basis on which {{usability}} evaluations are done. Multi-disciplinary software development teams, interaction designers, software engineers and business analysts among them, need {{to agree on a}} common set of goals before they design and evaluate interactive products. However, teams often struggle to set clear, measurable usability goals and all members may not be on the same page even late in the project. This paper proposes Usability Goal <b>setting</b> <b>Tool</b> (UGT), a tool meant to help design teams set, prioritise and evaluate usability goals. UGT helps the designer to create profiles for the product and its users. Based on these inputs, UGT provides examples and guidelines to prioritize the usability goals. UGT also suggests evaluation ideas for each goal. Prototypes of UGT were improved through formative evaluations by using it for 15 interaction design projects. Summative evaluations were done by applying UGT on 49 industry projects. Participants found UGT to be useful and systematic and said they would use it in their next project...|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} two decades there has been {{increasing}} concern about the potentially adverse effects of exogenous Endocrine Active Substances (EAS) that alter the function of the endocrine system by interfering with hormone regulation. The mechanistic pathways by which EAS may elicit adverse effects, such as developmental and reproductive toxicity, often involve direct binding to nuclear hormone receptors. Certainly the best studied nuclear receptor is the estrogen receptor. Large-scale in vitro and in vivo methods have been developed to assess the estrogenic toxicity of chemicals. However there are financial and animal welfare concerns related to their application. QSAR (Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship) approaches have proven their utility as a priority <b>setting</b> <b>tool</b> in the risk assessment. In addition the models help to clarify the binding mode of the interacting substances. Since the estrogen mediated effects are usually related to ligand-receptor interactions, and since there have been comprehensive structural studies on the estrogen receptor, molecular modelling (in silico) approaches provide a suitable means of studying these estrogenic effects. This chapter provides an overview of the molecular modelling approaches applied to ligand - estrogen receptor interactions. The progress in the field is outlined and some critical issues are analysed based on recently published models where these approaches are applied. JRC. I. 6 -Systems toxicolog...|$|E

40|$|Part 2 : Long and Short PapersInternational audienceDo teams achieve {{important}} usability goals {{most of the}} time? Further, is goal achievement uniform or are practitioners more {{mindful of}} some goals than others? This paper presents an empirical study on usability goal achievement in industry projects. We used Usability Goal <b>setting</b> <b>Tool</b> (UGT), a recommender system that helps teams set, prioritize, and evaluate usability goals. The practitioner creates profiles for the product and its users. Based on these inputs, UGT helps the practitioner break down high-level usability goals into more specific goal parameters and provides recommendations, examples, and guidelines to assign weights to these parameters. UGT suggests strategies to evaluate goal parameters after the design is ready and assign them scores. UGT was used to collect data from 65 projects in the Indian software industry in which participants assigned weights and scores to the goal parameters. The 30 goal parameters suggested by UGT {{were found to be}} internally reliable, and having acceptable granularity and coverage. It was observed that goal parameter weights and scores correlated, but only moderately. Another interesting observation was that {{more than a third of}} the important goal parameters did not score well. We identify eight goal parameters that are typically high-weighted but have poor weight-score correlations. We call these “latent but important” goal parameters. Design teams will do well to pay closer attention to these goal parameters during projects...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{multiple}} criteria {{decision analysis}} (MCDA) {{has emerged as}} a likely alternative to address shortcomings in health technology assessment (HTA) by offering a more holistic perspective to value assessment and acting as an alternative priority <b>setting</b> <b>tool.</b> In this paper, we argue that MCDA needs to subscribe to robust methodological processes related to the selection of objectives, criteria and attributes in order to be meaningful in the context of healthcare decision making and fulfil its role in value-based assessment (VBA). We propose a methodological process, based on multi-attribute value theory (MAVT) methods comprising five distinct phases, outline the stages involved in each phase and discuss their relevance in the HTA process. Importantly, criteria and attributes need to satisfy a set of desired properties, otherwise the outcome of the analysis can produce spurious results and misleading recommendations. Assuming the methodological process we propose is adhered to, the application of MCDA presents three very distinct advantages to decision makers in the context of HTA and VBA: first, it acts as an instrument for eliciting preferences on the performance of alternative options across a wider set of explicit criteria, leading to a more complete assessment of value; second, it allows the elicitation of preferences across the criteria themselves to reflect differences in their relative importance; and, third, the entire process of preference elicitation can be informed by direct stakeholder engagement, and can therefore reflect their own preferences. All features are fully transparent and facilitate decision making...|$|E
40|$|Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) provide {{geographic}} {{targets for}} the expansion of protected area coverage, and identify sites for urgent conservation action. Identification of KBAs in the Indo-Burma Hotspot was undertaken during 2003, for a region of analysis comprising Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar (Burma), Thailand and Vietnam, plus parts of southern China. The starting point was information on 282 Important Bird Areas identified by BirdLife International and collaborators. These data were then overlaid with point locality data on globally threatened mammals, reptiles, amphibians, freshwater fish and plants, with additional KBAs identified as required. Through this process, a total of 438 KBAs were identified, covering 258, 085 km 2 or 11. 5 percent of the region of analysis. Only 58 percent of the KBAs are wholly or partly included within protected areas, suggesting {{that there may be a}} need for further expansion of protected area networks, particularly in Myanmar and Vietnam. The criteria for KBA identification are triggered by 812 species, of which 23 are believed only to occur at a single KBA globally. The KBAs have proven to be a useful conservation priority <b>setting</b> <b>tool</b> in Indo-Burma, helping to guide investments by various donors and application of environmental safeguard policies by international financial institutions. There are fewer examples of KBAs being used to guide expansion of protected area systems in Indo-Burma. In large part, this is because the period of rapid expansion of protected areas in most hotspot countries predated the KBA identification process, and political support for further significant expansion is currently limited...|$|E

We developed and pilot tested the Avoiding Diabetes Thru Action Plan Targeting (ADAPT) program to enhance primary care providers' counseling about behavior change for patients with prediabetes. Primary care providers in two urban academic practices and their patients with prediabetes were recruited to participate in the ADAPT study, an unblinded randomized pragmatic trial to test the effectiveness of the ADAPT program, including a streamlined electronic medical record-based goal <b>setting</b> <b>tool.</b> Providers were randomized to intervention or control arms; eligible patients whose providers were in the intervention arm received the ADAPT program. Physical activity (the primary outcome) was measured using pedometers, and data were gathered about patients' diet, weight and glycemic control. A total of 54 patients were randomized and analyzed as part of the 6 -month ADAPT study (2010 – 2012, New York, NY). Those in the intervention group showed an increase total daily steps compared to those in the control group (+ 1418 vs − 598, p= 0. 007) at 6 months. There was also a trend towards weight loss in the intervention compared to the control group (− 1. 0 lbs. vs. 3. 0 lbs., p= 0. 11), although no change in glycemic control. The ADAPT study is among the first to use standard electronic medical record tools to embed goal setting into realistic primary care workflows and to demonstrate a significant improvement in prediabetes patients' physical activity...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, the {{operations}} regarding the tubing hanger crown plugs {{and the internal}} tree cap are studied and analyzed based on experience data collected from the Statoilo perated fields of Norne, Gullfaks, Åsgard and Heidrun. The Internal Tree Cap (ITC) has been analyzed considering operations involving puling of the lower Tubing Hanger Crown Plug (THCP) through the ball valve. Due {{to the extent of}} the problems seen with operating the ball valve, the cap is recommended pulled before pulling the lower crown plug. A contingency procedure is described in form of a decision tree, and should be use if the cap for some reason is not pulled. For the lower THCP problems have been identified for both pulling and setting operations. Problems with the Upper Wireline Plug (UWLP) are mostly during setting operations. For the lower THCP premature setting of the plug {{is one of the main}} problems. The premature setting is seen in connection with use of a brass pin as the upper shear pin in the CPHRT. A steel-steel combination for the two shear pins in the hydraulic running tool is therefore recommended. The CPHRT should also always be checked for water intrusion in order to ensure that the pistons in the RT are free to move all theway down when trying to lock the dogs into the tubing hanger nipple profile. It is recommended that the number of pistons in the running tool and the setting pressure should follow the table given in the Halliburton manual. Different methods have been used for pulling the THCP. Equalizing across the plug isseen as a necessity for a successful pulling operation. The pulling method with the highest success rate is the”Pressure up above” method. This method is currently just in use for the RLWI system but it is recommended that it be adapted and used for pulling through the WOR. Braided wire should be used when pulling the plug. Displacing fluid through the ¼” TCI-line between the upper and lower plug is seen asone of the challenges when trying to set the UWLP. Calculations done for setting inthe WOR and MR show that the pressure needed in the riser is dependent on the displacement velocity. The higher the pressure in the riser the faster the fluid willdisplace through the TCI-line. In the MR only hydrostatic pressure is available so alonger displacement time should be accounted for. A design failure with the UWLP <b>setting</b> <b>tool</b> has been investigated. When the runningtool is set in compression, a premature energizing of the plug locking dogs can occurand the plug is not able to set. It is recommended that the running tool should be held in tension until the plug has landed and it should be evaluated if a re-design of the tool is needed. New technology regarding the crown plugs is presented. This new technology includes an equalizing crown plug, a motorized <b>setting</b> <b>tool</b> and a pulling/jetting toolall under development for FMC Technologies. Best practice guidelines are developing for the installation and retrieval of the crown plugs based on the analyses performed. Best practice guidelines and recommendations are also made for operating the ITC. The analysis and recommendations given in this thesis should be used as a basis for developing a finalized best practice for crown plug operations. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background A {{partnership}} between two national charities and a UK-wide supermarket has a shared aim {{to reduce the}} risk of people developing Type 2 Diabetes and heart disease. Data released to the partnership from the supermarket showed that young families have the unhealthiest shopping baskets. Research has shown that younger women are less likely to achieve the recommended amount of weekly physical activity (Sport England Market Segmentation, 2010). Two Sport England profiles, Jackie and Paula, were identified as the primary target audience for interventions. Description A series of focus groups were held around the UK, with women from the primary target audience, to test out ideas and concepts. In these sessions, the women demonstrated that they could clearly identify what they needed to do to improve their health and that they did not need more health information. Instead, they wanted on-going support to encourage them to be more physically active and eat healthily. Women in the focus groups said they wanted to take small steps and to set realistic goals. They felt that with the right tools to help them, this would result in a long-term change. They use mobile phones to get and share information with friends. To meet this need, digital and prevention professionals from the partner organisations led the development and testing of a goal <b>setting</b> <b>tool,</b> available to use on both mobile phones and online. The final tool allows the user to set a goal and then supports them in achieving this goal through regular texts and emails offering reminders and encouraging messages. Conclusion Using data, research and the expertise of commercial and charity partners was an effective way to design a digital product to support behavioural change. By understanding the target audience from the beginning and involving them in the planning stages, the organisations were able to develop a tool the users want with a strong focus on user experience...|$|E
