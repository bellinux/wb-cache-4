40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to compare {{international}} ideal competencies for <b>Special</b> Collections <b>librarianship</b> to the possibility to acquire these competencies as a student of library education or as a professional librarian with the care of special collections in a public library in Sweden today. The questions posed are: How are international ideal competencies concerning special collections looked upon in Swedish public libraries? How can students or professional librarians today acquire competences necessary for the work at hand in special collections? Suggested in this thesis is to {{emphasize the importance of}} understanding that handling special collections demands other skills and belongs to other practices than ordinary work in a public library. The major discrepancy with international ideal competencies consists in the lack of ways for education in the field of special collections for both students and professional librarians in Sweden today...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Models of {{organization}} of library {{services for the}} blind and partially sighted from the view of <b>special</b> and public <b>librarianship</b> in selected countries were examined. In addition, theoretical and legislative frameworks, professional guidelines and trends are explored. Some terminological inconsistencies and obstacles in performing the services are also presented. Methodology/approach: The explorative-comparative study carried in the years 2008 - 2010 includes the comparative analysis of data acquired by the survey and literature desktop research. The research sample included 14 countries - eleven European countries, USA,Australia, and Canada. Results: The findings show great varieties among the selected countries, however,there is the trend of moving the organization of services based on a private charitable association to the formalized state supported system. The majority of countries have applied the centralized model with one specialized (national) library. There is rarely a case of formal inclusion of public libraries {{in the organization of}} services. Recent major professional interests in the field of providing library services to visually impaired are broadening the copyright exceptions and user groups, and the implementation of information technology for bigger production of alternative formats and availability of library materials. Research limitation: The low rate of survey response and the differences in the organization of library services influenced on the lack of data and low level of data comparability.

40|$|Within {{the next}} two decades, the {{population}} of Indonesia is projected to be 258. 2 million. Thus, the need for food will dramatically increase and agricultural productivity should be increased accordingly. However, concomitantly industry, housing, and other sectors must also expand and call on land resource availability.

40|$|Discourses that {{celebrate}} the knowledge economy accentuate its novelty {{at the expense}} of historical assessments of the role information has played in economic development. In the early twentieth century formal recognition was given to the importance of knowledge as a prime factor of production by firms that established the first in-house technical library in Britain. This paper reports on funded research undertaken at Leeds Metropolitan University on the âearly information society in Britain. â Part of this research project focuses on the emergence of information managementâincluding systems for the storage and retrieval of technical informationâin large-scale enterprises before the age of the computer. An empirical study is offered of in-house technical libraries before approximately 1950, followed by an analysis of the contexts that drove their development. It is suggested, in conclusion, that such libraries contributed significantly to the information management revolution of the early twentieth century. Technical libraries in British industrial and commercial enterprises before the middle of the twentieth century are a class of library relatively hidden from history. Although a fairly extensive literature exists on company technical libraries after 1950, much less is known about such libraries before this date. 1 As both <b>special</b> <b>librarianship</b> and information work became more important after World War II, practitioners in these fields, including the realm of the company technical library, began to publicize much more widelyâin handbooks and guides and in the library pressâthe organization...|$|E
40|$|Tw o IMPORTANT {{conferences}} on library education {{were held in}} 1948. The first {{was held at the}} Graduate Library School, University of Chicago, August 16 - 21. Justified through the value of its own content and the originality of its participants, it laid down no pro-gram for future action, and its influence was entrusted to the publiea-tion of its papers and the criticisms they inspired. l It should be added that this influence may be considerable if enough of the right kind of persons read the volume, but even under the best of conditions the results of the book will depend upon the imagination of its readers. The second conference took place December 11 - 12, at Princeton University under sponsorship of the Council of National Library Asso-ciations. This conference also led to a publication, this time a summary of the proceedings which included resolutions or recommendations bearing on future developments. 2 The guiding forces of this conference endeavored to set in motion certain activities which would affect li-brary education {{for a long time to}} come. I t was more than mere coincidence, of course, that two meetings on the same broad topic should be held and successfully executed within less than half a year. The same fundainental reasons underlay both-changing patterns in educational practice and needs, and a feeling of uncertainty respecting directions and goals. The earlier conference in Chicago was by far the broader of the two. Its roster embraced notable individuals from outside the library field who were sometimes quite ready to criticize strongly the self-esteem of professional librarians. The Princeton conference, on the other hand, was attended exclusively by librarians (though they were not all educators), and whether they were sufficiently critical of their own work can only be determined by a subjective reading of the proceedings.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{information}} as {{we use it}} in everyday English in the sense knowledge communicated plays {{a central role in}} today's society. The concept became particularly predominant since end of World War II with the widespread use of computer networks. The rise of information science in the middle fifties is a testimony of this. For a science like information science (IS) it is of course important how its fundamental terms are defined, and in IS as in other fields {{the problem of how to}} define information is often raised. This review is an attempt to overview the present status of the information concept in IS with a view also to interdisciplinary trends. In scientific discourses theoretical concepts are not true or false elements or pictures of some part of reality, but are constructions designed to do a job the best possible way. Different conceptions of fundamental terms like information are thus more or less fruitful depending on what theories (and in the end what practical actions) they are expected to support. In Chapter 1, we discuss the problems of defining terms in the light of the philosophy of science. The history of a word tells us mostly only anecdotes that are peripheral to the concept itself. But in our case the use of the word information points to a specific perspective under which the concept of knowledge communication was defined and designated. We explore this history in Chapter 2 and we believe that our results may help to better understand the complexity of this concept also with regard to its scientific definitions. The discussions about the information concept in other disciplines are also very important for Information Science because many theories and approaches in Information Science have their origins in other disciplines. This is surveyed in Chapter 3. The epistemological concept of information has lead also to a new perspective of non-human information processes particularly in physics and biology. And vice versa: processes of selection and interpretation may be considered when related to psychic and social phenomena with regard to objective parameters, leaving aside the semantic dimension or, more precisely, considering objective or situational parameters of interpretation. This can be illustrated also in physical terms with regard to release mechanisms as we suggest at the end of Chapter 3. Our overview of the concept of information in the natural sciences as well as in the humanities and social sciences does not aim at exploring different theories in depth. In most cases we can only refer to fragments of theories that the user may interpret within her own background or follow the hints of the bibliography. Readers mostly interested in information science may get more satisfied with Chapter 4 where we bring a more detailed explanation of diverse views and theories of information within our field, supplementing the ARIST article by Cornelius (2001). We show that the introduction of the concept of information about 1950 to what was formerly <b>special</b> <b>librarianship</b> and documentation in itself has had serious consequences for the kind of knowledge and theories developed in our field. The important question is not only what meaning we give to the term in Information Science, but also how it relates to other basic terms such as documents, texts and knowledge...|$|E
40|$|Library Education in Nigeria {{was very}} much tied up with the general social and {{political}} history of the Country. As such, those who aspired to become librarians went to Britain {{to qualify for the}} Associate of the Library Association (ALA). However, with the attainment of independence in 1960, the country witnessed the establishment of educational institutions at various levels. The first Library school was established at University College Ibadan in 1960. Prior to 1960, the Carnegie Corporation has sponsored two studies (Margaret Wrong in 1939 and Ethel Fagan in 1940) to survey the Library needs of West Africa with the view to formalizing its training program. Wrong recommended for a Library Training Institute to be established in Nigeria while Fagan, recommended instead the establishment of a Regional Library Institute to cater for the whole of British West Africa. Consequently, the British Council, Carnegie Corporation and the Governments of Gold Coast (Ghana), Nigeria and Sierra Leone jointly financed the Achimota Library School in Ghana, which was opened in 1944. The main objective of the school was to âimprove the technical competence of Library Assistants and to prepare them for {{the first part of the}} British Library Association Registration Examination. â (Aguolu and Mohammed 1987). The stage for the development of Library Profession in Nigeria was set up with the arrival of John Harris as the Librarian of the University College Ibadan in 1948. âHe was not only instrumental to the development of the University College Library, but also organized the Native Authority Libraries in 1950, the first organized Library Training courseâ (Dean 1966). Similarly in 1952, Joan Allen organized a course for Reading Room Attendants under the Northern Regional Library Service while the Eastern Regional Library Board created in 1935, introduced a training course for Library Assistants in 1956. Another turning point in the history of Librarianship in the Country was the UNESCO seminar on Public Library Development in Africa held at Ibadan in 1953. Aguolu and Mohammed (1987) observed that âit laid the foundation of modern libraries in Nigeria and help crystallize the concept of the library profession and librarianship itself. â Based on (Lancour 1958 and Sharr 1963) reports on Library needs of West Africa and Northern Nigeria respectively, two Library Schools were established in Nigeria. The first was the Institute of Librarianship which was opened at the University College Ibadan in 1960, and the second was at the Ahmadu Bello University Zaria in 1968. These institutions were built on different philosophical and professional orientations. The Ibadan Library School began with one year basic professional program leading to the award of the post-graduate diploma with the main objective of âeducating the leadership for the library professionâ, while the Zaria Library School started with under-graduate program leading to the award of the Bachelor of Library Science (BLS) degree based on the objective of âtraining professional librarians at all levels with well rounded education up to international standard while placing emphasis on the problems facing libraries in Africa. â It apparently became clear in the mid 1970 s that the two existing Library Schools despite their parallel philosophical orientation, cannot meet the nationâs library needs. Thus, in 1977 and 1978 two additional Library Schools were established at Bayero University Kano and University of Maiduguri respectively. Presently, there are over fifty institutions including Universities (Federal, States and Private) Polytechnics and Colleges across the Country that offer Library and Information Science programs at Certificate; Ordinary, National and Higher Diploma; Degree and Higher Degree levels. The proliferation of library programs in different types of institutions can be seen as a good development for the profession, on the other hand however, it has given rise to issues of relevance of curriculum to professional practice; quality of Library Schoolâs graduates; and their competence in the field. On the issue of curricular of Library Schools, Conant (1990) lamented that âemployersâ lack confidence in the functions of library schools as gate keepers to the professionâ. In order to restore this confidence according to him âlibrary schools must revise their curriculum to correspond appropriately to the knowledge and skills required of the professional librarian. â One major weakness of library schools curricular identified by Danton (1946) is âthe inability of library schools curricular to be integrated with any theoretical discipline such as Sociology, Education, Political science etc. on which practical disciplines are based or on the philosophy of the subject to serve as its foundationâ. Library Education was of sufficient international concern to merit the Standing Committee of IFLA (1976) Section for Library Schools, to decide to undertake the task of formulating International Standards for library education. This move pre-supposed the existence of differences in library education worldwide. IFLA still recognizes the uniqueness of each country, hence each country should decide for itself what kind of librarians and information specialists it needs and what kind of training such persons ought to have. Agada (1985) puts it clearly when he said âwhile theories and principles may be universal, however practice cannot and need not be. Relevance dictates that practice be adapted to local needs and circumstances. â The quality of products from library schools is another contentious issue between employers and educators. Employers are interested in the production of practical persons who can fit into the library environment immediately after graduation. Banjo (1984) for example, specifically analyzed the qualities required of a Special librarian thus âmust be a man who is able to sense, identify, and interpret information in a special area for the use of the specialist in that area. He must therefore be versatile, adaptable and highly imaginative. Here in lies the challenge to those providing education for <b>special</b> <b>librarianship.</b> â Reaction from the field of practice based on the accounts and reports of library administrators and employers has indicated consistent short comings on the part of the Bachelor of Library Science (BLS) graduates. Ita (1986) stated that âproducts of the undergraduate programs are in general rather weak and less imaginative. For a long time a certain air of vagueness seems to hang on them so that they approach their professional duties with little confidence. â Affia (1986) another seasoned library administrator observed that graduates from the BLS programs have a feeling of insecurity in certain job opportunities. To sum up employersâ expectations of library education, Cronin (1982) has this to say âprofessional qualification and experience do not automatically guarantee acceptability in the eyes of employing organizations. Employers want individuals who have certain positive characteristics. Basically, these can be defined as good communication and organizational skills, the ability to work in a small team, and the ability to work with minimum supervision. ...|$|E
