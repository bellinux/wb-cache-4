500|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature has {{listed the}} bignose shark as Data Deficient overall, due to {{inadequate}} population and fishery monitoring. The species {{is considered to}} be of concern, however, given it is slow-reproducing and faces widespread heavy fishing pressure. There is evidence that its numbers have recently declined in the Maldives. Furthermore, most bignose shark bycatch occurs in international waters, where a single stock may be affected by multiple fisheries. It is listed as a [...] "highly migratory species" [...] under the 1995 UN Agreement on the Conservation and Management of <b>Straddling</b> <b>Fish</b> <b>Stocks</b> and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, but thus far this has not led to significant conservation measures. Regionally, the IUCN has assessed the bignose shark as Near Threatened in the northwestern Atlantic. Though specific data are lacking, it is suspected to have declined there because it is commonly misidentified as the sandbar shark, thus the known decline in sandbar shark numbers resulting from US longline fishing may represent a decline in bignose shark numbers, as well. This species has been assessed as Least Concern in Australian waters, where it faces no significant threats.|$|E

40|$|In March 1995, Canadian gunboats seized and impounded a Spanish fishing trawler and cut {{the nets}} of another Spanish boat for alleged {{violations}} of international quotas and regulations governing the fishing of Greenland Halibut in the international waters of the North Atlantic. 1 Spain and the European Union (EU) responded by alleging that the Canadians violated international law and committed an act of piracy by seizing a foreign ship in international waters. 2 The EU threatened to impose economic sanctions against Canada, and the Spanish government responded by sending its own gunboats into the North Atlantic. 3 The stage was set for a classic shoot-out on the high seas. This comment analyzes the Canada-EU dispute in light of current fisheries law as embodied in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III). 2 ̆ 7 More specifically, it examines how the Canada-EU dispute highlights some major deficiencies in the existing system of international fisheries law regulating straddling and highly migratory <b>fish</b> <b>stocks.</b> 5 In addition, this comment discusses the most recent attempt aimed at reforming international fishery law and preventing future international disputes concerning straddling and mi- gratory fish stocks: the August 1995 United Nations Agreement on Straddling and Highly Migratory <b>Fish</b> <b>Stocks</b> (<b>Fish</b> <b>Stocks</b> Agree- ment). 6 This comment argues that, although the <b>Fish</b> <b>Stocks</b> Agree- ment {{is an important step}} {{in the creation of a}} solid legal framework to regulate <b>straddling</b> and migratory <b>fish</b> <b>stocks,</b> it contains several ambi- guities which may hamper its ability to address current deficiencies in fisheries law which contributed to the 1995 Canada-EU dispute.

40|$|We {{investigate}} how high seas closure {{will affect the}} availability of commonly consumed food fish in 46 fish reliant, and/or low income countries. Domestic consumption of <b>straddling</b> <b>fish</b> species (fish that {{would be affected by}} high seas closure) occurred in 54 % of the assessed countries. The majority (70 %) of countries were projected to experience net catch gains following high seas closure. However, countries with projected catch gains and that also consumed the <b>straddling</b> <b>fish</b> species domestically made up only 37 % of the assessed countries. In contrast, much fewer countries (25 %) were projected to incur net losses from high seas closure, and of these, straddling species were used domestically in less than half (45 %) of the countries. Our findings suggest that, given the current consumption patterns of straddling species, high seas closure may only directly benefit the supply of domestically consumed food fish in a small number of fish reliant and/or low income countries. In particular, it may not have a substantial impact on improving domestic fish supply in countries with the greatest need for improved access to affordable fish, as only one third of this group used <b>straddling</b> <b>fish</b> species domestically. Also, food security in countries with projected net catch gains but where <b>straddling</b> <b>fish</b> species are not consumed domestically may still benefit indirectly via economic activities arising from the increased availability of non-domestically consumed <b>straddling</b> <b>fish</b> species following high seas closure. Consequently, this study suggests that high seas closure can potentially improve marine resource sustainability as well as contribute to human well-being in some of the poorest and most fish dependent countries worldwide. However, caution is required because high seas closure may also negatively affect fish availability in countries that are already impoverished and fish insecure...|$|R

40|$|<b>Fish</b> <b>stocks</b> have an {{important}} role in providing cheap protein food, income and employment to millions of people in the world. Judicious management and exploitation of the renewable fish resources is important for sustained production over years. Over fishing leads to disappearance of the renewable <b>fish</b> <b>stocks.</b> Assessment of <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> is the first step to determine the level of exploitation necessary for arriving at maximum sustainable yields from the fish resources. Assessment of stocks and study of impact of present level of exploitation on exploited stocks are necessary for maintenance of stocks at maximum sustainable level.

40|$|AbstractMost of the <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> in the world, {{including}} European <b>fish</b> <b>stocks,</b> {{are threatened}} by overfishing and/or degraded environmental conditions. Although the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is the main policy instrument managing <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> in Europe, there is continued concern as to whether commercial <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> will achieve Good Environmental Status (GEnS) in 2020 {{in accordance with the}} Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). In this context, the evaluation of the status of <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> in the subareas of FAO fishing area 27 was carried out using mean trophic levels (MTL) in fish landings and spawning stock biomass (SSB). Comparisons were made before and after 2008 to establish whether the trend is positive or negative. The main data sources for landings and SSB were the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) advisory reports. MTLs in landing and SSB were determined for each subarea and the subareas were categorized into four groups, according to MTLs after 2008. The first group (subareas I + II, V) had higher MTL in landings and higher MTL in SSB after 2008. Therefore, fisheries in these subareas appear sustainable. The second group was subareas VIII + IX, for which the <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> have higher MTL in landings but low MTL in SSB, indicating that SSB was being overfished. The third was subarea (VI), where <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> have lower MTL in landings than those in SSB after 2008, which may indicate that <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> are recovering. <b>Fish</b> <b>stocks</b> in the fourth group (subareas III, IV and VII) had low MTL in landings and the MTL in SSB was lower than that of landings before 2008. This may be due to heavy fishing. In addition, we estimated the harvest rate (HR) of the <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> before and after 2008. The results showed that most of the <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> have lower HR after 2008, indicating that the status has improved, perhaps due to improvements in the implementation of CFP. However, some <b>fish</b> <b>stocks</b> showed high HR even after 2008, so that new management options are still needed. Other factors such as eutrophication, seafloor disturbances, marine pollution, invasive species etc., influence SSB ecosystem health options and should also be incorporated in the management criteria. Most of these environmental pressures are of high priority in the MSFD, and therefore {{the findings of this study}} will be useful for both CFP and MSFD...|$|R
