5|$|According to the International Energy Agency, {{cellulosic}} ethanol biorefineries {{could allow}} biofuels {{to play a}} much bigger role in the future than {{organizations such as the}} IEA previously thought. Cellulosic ethanol can be made from plant matter composed primarily of inedible cellulose fibers that form the stems and branches of most plants. Crop residues (such as corn stalks, wheat straw and rice straw), wood waste, and municipal solid waste are potential sources of cellulosic biomass. Dedicated energy crops, such as switchgrass, are also promising cellulose sources that can be <b>sustainably</b> produced in many regions.|$|E
5|$|Moving towards {{sustainability}} is also {{a social}} challenge that entails international and national law, urban planning and transport, local and individual lifestyles and ethical consumerism. Ways of living more <b>sustainably</b> can take many forms from reorganizing living conditions (e.g., ecovillages, eco-municipalities and sustainable cities), reappraising economic sectors (permaculture, green building, sustainable agriculture), or work practices (sustainable architecture), using science to develop new technologies (green technologies, renewable energy and sustainable fission and fusion power), or designing systems in a flexible and reversible manner, and adjusting individual lifestyles that conserve natural resources.|$|E
5|$|The Incredible Hulk joined Toronto's Green-Screen initiative, to help cut carbon {{emissions}} and waste created during filming. Producer Gale Anne Hurd acknowledged the Hulk, being green, {{was a popular}} environmental analogy, and Norton himself was an environmentalist. Hybrid and fuel efficient vehicles were used, with low sulfur diesel as their energy source. The construction department used a <b>sustainably</b> harvested, locally sourced yellow pine instead of lauan for the sets, and also used zero-or low-VOC paint. The wood was generally recycled or given to environmental organizations, and paint cans were handed to waste management. In addition, they used cloth bags, biodegradable food containers, china and silverware food utensils, a stainless steel mug for each production crew member, a contractor who removed bins, recycled paper, biodegradable soap and cleaners in the trailers and production offices, and the sound department used rechargeable batteries. The Incredible Hulk became the first blockbuster film to receive the Environmental Media Association's Green Seal, which is displayed during the end credits.|$|E
25|$|Groundwater {{availability}} is not precise in Honduras, however, wells {{located in}} the lowlands of the Atlantic coast historically have good yields {{and are able to}} <b>sustainably</b> supplement water needs there. In 1973, CEPAL (La Comisión Económica para América Latina), estimated that 9.09km3 of renewable groundwater could be <b>sustainably</b> exploited for use.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, {{environmentalist}} C.M. Peters and two colleagues stated {{there is}} economic {{as well as}} biological incentive to protecting the rainforest. One hectare in the Peruvian Amazon has been calculated to have a value of $6820 if intact forest is <b>sustainably</b> harvested for fruits, latex, and timber; $1000 if clear-cut for commercial timber (not <b>sustainably</b> harvested); or $148 if used as cattle pasture.|$|E
25|$|Fusion {{power has}} the {{potential}} to provide sufficient energy to satisfy mounting demand, and to do so <b>sustainably,</b> with a relatively small impact on the environment.|$|E
25|$|Because {{forests and}} {{societies}} are in constant flux, the desired outcome of {{sustainable forest management}} is not a fixed one. What constitutes a <b>sustainably</b> managed forest will change over time as values held by the public change.|$|E
25|$|Other coastal {{resources}} such as cowrie and cuttlefish play a nominal role, and can be <b>sustainably</b> exploited at the present level. However, resources that can be cultured such as giant clams, sea cucumber, some species of aquarium fish, and turtles, have considerable potential.|$|E
25|$|Trinidad and Tobago, in {{an effort}} to undergo {{economic}} transformation though diversification formed InvesTT in 2012 to serve as the country's sole investment promotion agency.

25|$|The International Organisation of Biological Control (IOBC) {{describes}} Integrated Farming {{according to}} the UNI 11233-2009 European standard as a farming system where high quality organic food, feed, fibre and renewable energy are produced by using resources such as soil, water, air and nature as well as regulating factors to farm <b>sustainably</b> and with as little polluting inputs as possible.|$|E
25|$|Most fundamentally, Survival {{believes}} {{that it is the}} respect for the right to keep their land that may allow them to survive. The issues of human rights and freedom depend on the land on which they can subsist and develop according to their own culture. Interference with this basic need endangers their capacity to live <b>sustainably.</b>|$|E
25|$|The American Birding Association, Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center, National Arbor Day Foundation, and the Rainforest Alliance {{have led}} a {{campaign}} for 'shade-grown' and organic coffees, which can be <b>sustainably</b> harvested. Shaded coffee cultivation systems show greater biodiversity than full-sun systems, and those more distant from continuous forest compare rather poorly to undisturbed native forest in terms of habitat value for some bird species.|$|E
25|$|The {{sheer size}} and {{complexity}} of megacities gives rise to enormous social and environmental challenges. Whether megacities can develop <b>sustainably</b> depends {{to a large extent}} on how they obtain, share, and manage their energy and material resources. There are correlations between electricity consumption, heating and industrial fuel use, ground transportation energy use, water consumption, waste generation, and steel production in terms of level of consumption and how efficiently they use resources.|$|E
25|$|Mullum Mullum Creek is a creek in {{the outer}} eastern suburbs of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It is the main {{watercourse}} of the Mullum Mullum Valley, {{a tributary of the}} Yarra River and Yarra Valley. For {{tens of thousands of years}} it was used as a food and tool source <b>sustainably</b> by the Wurundjeri people, Indigenous Australians of the Kulin nation, who spoke variations of the Woiwurrung language group.|$|E
25|$|PittMoss, a {{peat moss}} {{alternative}} {{made from recycled}} newspaper, {{has emerged as a}} sustainable substitute in growing media. Coir has also been touted as a sustainable alternative to peat moss in growing media. Another peat moss alternative is manufactured in California from <b>sustainably</b> harvested redwood fiber. Semi-open cell polyurethane materials available in flaked and sheet stock are also finding application as sphagnum replacements with typical usage in green wall and roof garden substrates.|$|E
25|$|Bath sponges are {{currently}} being produced using the sponge Coscinoderma matthewsi with production of about 12,000 sponges, sold locally to residents and tourists in Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia. These sponges {{are one of the}} only true <b>sustainably</b> farmed sea sponges in the world. The sponges are farmed via the rope method, with low investment costs of a few thousand dollars for farming and maintenance equipment, producing 100% natural sponges with no harsh chemicals added during processing.|$|E
25|$|In June 2012 {{an updated}} version of the BMW i3 concept car was {{unveiled}} {{at the opening of the}} first BMW i store, located on Park Lane in London, UK. The updated i3 concept consists of a new interior colour and materials concept. The seat covers combine responsibly sourced wool and leather naturally tanned with an olive oil leaf-based agent. The almost symmetrical curving dash is inlaid with treated eucalyptus wood that, according to BMW, is sourced from <b>sustainably</b> managed European forests.|$|E
25|$|In Europe {{problems}} with high nitrate concentrations in run-off are being {{addressed by the}} European Union's Nitrates Directive. Within Britain, farmers are encouraged to manage their land more <b>sustainably</b> in 'catchment-sensitive farming'. In the US, high concentrations of nitrate and phosphorus in runoff and drainage water are classified as non-point source pollutants due to their diffuse origin; this pollution is regulated at state level. Oregon and Washington, both in the United States, have fertilizer registration programs with on-line databases listing chemical analyses of fertilizers.|$|E
25|$|Emphasizing {{the limits}} of {{approaches}} that focus mainly on institutional answers to ethnic conflicts—which are essentially driven by ethnocultural dynamics of which political and/or economic factors are but elements—Gregory Paul Meyjes urges the use of intercultural communication and cultural-rights based negotiations as tools with which to effectively and <b>sustainably</b> address inter-ethnic strife. Meyjes argues that to fully grasp, preempt, and/or resolve such conflicts—whether {{with or without the}} aid of territorial or non-territorial institutional mechanism(s) -- a cultural rights approach grounded in intercultural knowledge and skill is essential.|$|E
25|$|In {{a global}} survey of water specialists {{undertaken}} in 2003 to gauge perceptions of environmental flow, 88% of the 272 respondents {{agreed that the}} concept is essential for <b>sustainably</b> managing water resources and meeting the long-term needs of people. In 2007, the Brisbane Declaration on Environmental Flows was endorsed by more than 750 practitioners from more than 50 countries. The declaration announced an official pledge {{to work together to}} protect and restore the world's rivers and lakes. By 2010, many countries throughout the world had adopted environmental flow policies, although their implementation remains a challenge.|$|E
25|$|The International Day of Peace, {{sometimes}} unofficially {{known as}} World Peace Day, is observed annually on 21 September. It {{is dedicated to}} peace, and specifically the absence of war and violence, such as might be occasioned by a temporary ceasefire in a combat zone for humanitarian aid access. The day was first celebrated in 1982, and is kept by many nations, political groups, military groups, and peoples. In 2013, for the first time, the Day has been dedicated to peace education, i.e. by the key preventive means to reduce war <b>sustainably.</b>|$|E
25|$|Micro-hydro {{configured}} into mini-grids {{also provide}} power. Over 44 million households use biogas made in household-scale digesters for lighting and/or cooking, {{and more than}} 166 million households rely on {{a new generation of}} more-efficient biomass cookstoves. Clean liquid fuel sourced from renewable feedstocks are used for cooking and lighting in energy-poor areas of the developing world. Alcohol fuels (ethanol and methanol) can be produced <b>sustainably</b> from non-food sugary, starchy, and cellulostic feedstocks. Project Gaia, Inc. and CleanStar Mozambique are implementing clean cooking programs with liquid ethanol stoves in Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria and Mozambique.|$|E
25|$|For forest managers, <b>sustainably</b> {{managing}} a particular forest tract means determining, in a tangible way, {{how to use}} it today to ensure similar benefits, health and productivity in the future. Forest managers must assess and integrate a wide array of sometimes conflicting factors – commercial and non-commercial values, environmental considerations, community needs, even global impact – to produce sound forest plans. In most cases, forest managers develop their forest plans in consultation with citizens, businesses, organizations and other interested parties in and around the forest tract being managed. The tools and visualization have been recently evolving for better management practices.|$|E
25|$|CI {{works with}} governments, universities, NGOs {{and the private}} sector with the aim of replicating these successes on a larger scale. By showing how {{conservation}} can work at all scales, CI aims to make the protection of nature a key consideration in economic development decisions around the world. CI supported 23 Pacific Island nations and territories {{in the formation of the}} Pacific Oceanscape, a framework to conserve and <b>sustainably</b> manage over 15 million square miles of sea in the South Pacific. In addition to the sustainable management of ocean resources, the agreement includes the world's largest marine protected areas and sanctuaries for whales, dolphins, turtles and sharks.|$|E
25|$|In October 2014, Quang Binh {{province}} {{announced plans}} by Sun Group {{to build a}} cable car system linking caves in the park. The plan was met {{with a great deal}} of opposition from conservationists, and the government backtracked, saying that the plan was not yet approved. Proponents say that the area is attracting a growing number of visitors and that the cable car would be the most environmentally friendly means of managing the crowds. Opponents say that construction of the cable car system could damage the fragile caves, and once it is operational it would attract more visitors than the park can <b>sustainably</b> handle.|$|E
25|$|The {{immediate}} livelihood benefits {{derived by}} rural households bolster strong collective action wherein local communities actively and <b>sustainably</b> manage forest resources. Community forests also became {{the source of}} diversified investment capital and raw material for new market-oriented livelihoods. Community forestry shows traits of political, financial, and ecological sustainability, including an emergence of a strong legal and regulatory framework, and robust civil society institutions and networks. However, a continuing challenge is to ensure equitable distribution of benefits to women and marginalised groups. Lessons for replication emphasise experiential learning, establishment of a strong civil society network, flexible regulation to encourage diverse institutional modalities, and responsiveness of government and policymakers to a multistakeholder collaborative learning process.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} {{population density}} for Aborigines {{developed in the}} southern and eastern regions, the River Murray valley in particular. Aborigines lived and used resources on the continent <b>sustainably,</b> agreeing to cease hunting and gathering at particular times to give populations and resources the chance to replenish. The arrival of Australia's first people nevertheless affected the continent significantly, and, along with climate change, {{may have contributed to}} the extinction of Australia's megafauna. The practice of firestick farming amongst northern Aborigines to increase the abundance of plants that attracted animals, transformed dry rainforest into savanna. The introduction of the dingo by Aboriginal people around 3,000–4,000 years ago may, along with human hunting, have contributed to the extinction of the thylacine, Tasmanian devil, and Tasmanian native-hen from mainland Australia.|$|E
25|$|India {{is one of}} the world's largest {{consumer}} of fuel-wood. India's consumption of fuel-wood is about five times higher than what can be <b>sustainably</b> removed from forests. However, a large percentage of this fuel-wood is grown as biomass remaining from agriculture, and is managed outside forests. Fuel-wood meets about 40% of the energy needs of the country. Around 80% of rural people and 48% of urban people use fuel-wood. Unless India makes major, rapid and sustained effort to expand electricity generation and power plants, the rural and urban poor in India will continue to meet their energy needs through unsustainable destruction of forests and fuel wood consumption. India's dependence on fuel-wood and forestry products as a primary energy source is not only environmentally unsustainable, it is a primary cause of India's near-permanent haze and air pollution.|$|E
25|$|A {{model of}} the {{interaction}} between fish and fishers showed that when an area is closed to fishers, but there are no catch regulations such as individual transferable quotas, fish catches are temporarily increased but overall fish biomass is reduced, resulting in the opposite outcome from the one desired for fisheries. Thus, a displacement of the fleet from one locality to another will generally have little effect if the same quota is taken. As a result, management measures such as temporary closures or establishing a marine protected area of fishing areas are ineffective when not combined with individual fishing quotas. An inherent problem with quotas is that fish populations vary from year to year. A study has found that fish populations rise dramatically after stormy years due to more nutrients reaching the surface and therefore greater primary production. To fish <b>sustainably,</b> quotas need to be changed each year to account for fish population.|$|E
25|$|Brazil. Eucalyptus was {{introduced}} to Brazil in 1910, for timber substitution and the charcoal industry. It has thrived in the local environment, and today there are around 7 million hectares planted. The wood is highly valued by the charcoal and pulp and paper industries. The short rotation allows a larger wood production and supplies wood for several other activities, helping to preserve the native forests from logging. When well managed, the plantation soils can sustain endless replanting. Eucalyptus plantings are also used as wind breaks. Brazil's plantations have world-record rates of growth, typically over 40 cubic metres per hectare per year, and commercial harvesting occurs after years 5. Due to continual development and governmental funding, year-on-year growth is consistently being improved. Eucalyptus can produce up to 100 cubic metres per hectare per year. Brazil has become the top exporter and producer of Eucalyptus round wood and pulp, and has {{played an important role}} in developing the Australian market through the country's committed research in this area. The local iron producers in Brazil rely heavily on <b>sustainably</b> grown Eucalyptus for charcoal; this has greatly pushed up the price of charcoal in recent years. The plantations are generally owned and operated for national and international industry by timber asset companies such as Thomson Forestry, Greenwood Management or cellulose producers such as Aracruz Cellulose and Stora Enso.|$|E
25|$|During {{an event}} on March 21, 2016, Apple {{provided}} a status update on its environmental initiative to be 100% renewable {{in all of}} its worldwide operations. Lisa P. Jackson, Apple's vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives who reports directly to CEO, Tim Cook, announced that as of March 2016, 93% of Apple's worldwide operations are powered with renewable energy. Also featured was the company's efforts to use sustainable paper in their product packaging; 99% of all paper used by Apple in the product packaging comes from post-consumer recycled paper or <b>sustainably</b> managed forests, as the company continues its move to all paper packaging for all of its products. Apple working in partnership with Conservation Fund, have preserved 36,000 acres of working forests in Maine and North Carolina. Another partnership announced is with the World Wildlife Fund to preserve up to 1,000,000 acres of forests in China. Featured was the company's installation of a 40 MW solar power plant in the Sichuan province of China that was tailor made to coexist with the indigenous yaks that eat hay produced on the land, by raising the panels to be several feet off of the ground so the yaks and their feed would be unharmed grazing beneath the array. This installation alone compensates for more than all of the energy used in Apple's Stores and Offices in the whole of China, negating the company's energy carbon footprint in the country. In Singapore, Apple has worked with the Singaporean government to cover the rooftops of 800 buildings in the city-state with solar panels allowing Apple's Singapore operations to be run on 100% renewable energy. Liam was introduced to the world, an advanced robotic disassembler and sorter designed by Apple Engineers in California specifically for recycling outdated or broken iPhones.
