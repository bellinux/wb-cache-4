40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new concept, based on variable dead time control, in adaptive single-pole auto reclosing (SPAR). The proposed scheme can {{give rise to}} a high rate of <b>successful</b> <b>reclosing</b> by adapting to variable dead times. The significance of this algorithm is that it uses the waveform patterns of the voltage transients following initial breaker opening. The performance of this proposed method is tested under a variety of fault locations on the Korean 765 kV system, and the outcome of the study clearly indicates that variable dead time auto-reclosing scheme can be used as an attractive and effective means of better management and operation of a high-voltage transmission system...|$|E
30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{reclosing}} scheme using synchronism checking for utilization of battery {{energy storage system}} (BESS) in a distribution system. The algorithm disconnects the faulty phase and keeps the power supply from the BESS to the healthy phase. Synchronism checking between the main source side and the load side is applied to minimize the transients at the reclosing instant. The BESS at the faulty phase is reconnected after checking the <b>successful</b> <b>reclosing.</b> The distribution system including BESS and proposed reclosing scheme are modeled by the electromagnetic transients program (EMTP)/ATPDraw. The various simulations by varing the fault clearing time are conducted and the simulation results are discussed. Also, the relation between proposed reclosing scheme and reliability is discussed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{control system}} for a {{recloser}} allows a selected number of attempts to restore service after adjustable time delays. For example a recloser may have 2 or 3 [...] "fast" [...] reclose operations with a few seconds delay, then a longer delay and one reclose; if the last attempt is not <b>successful,</b> the <b>recloser</b> will lock out and require human intervention to reset. If the fault is a permanent fault (downed wires, tree limbs lying on the wires, etc.) the autorecloser will exhaust its pre-programmed attempts to re-energize the line and remain tripped off until manually commanded to try again. About 80-90% of faults on overhead power lines are transient and can be cured by autoreclosing. The result is increased availability of supply.|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of faults in the transmission network can be successfully cleared by {{the proper use}} of protective relays to trip the respective circuit breakers and to bring back the system to normalcy using high speed autoreclosing. Thus, autoreclosing can significantly reduce the outage time due to faults and provide a higher level of service continuity to the customer. Furthermore, <b>successful</b> high-speed <b>reclosing</b> on transmission circuits can be a major factor when attempting to maintain system stability during fault clearing. Initial studies revealed that a detailed study of Autoreclosing settings in the transmission network of Ceylon Electricity Board and their performance based on failure analysis has not been carried out since the review of the protection system and settings by Lahmeyer International in 1996. Further there has been a brief analysis by the PB power consultants in their report on the CEB transmission system and organizational arrangements for operation and maintenance in October 1999. Since then there has been a comprehensive expansion of the CEB transmission network. Existing settings were reviewed along with failure incidents recorded during the period of November 2006 to August 2012 in the selected transmission lines. The stability analysis was carried out with the existing settings and prospective settings using the existing CEB power system which is modeled in PSSE software. Based on the simulated results, analysis of failure incidents, review of existing settings and the literature available on the practices followed in determining Auto reclose settings a set of Auto reclose settings for 220 kV and 132 kV transmission lines were proposed. These new settings and recommendations will improve the AR success rate thereby improving the reliability of the network. It will also minimize the risk of major failures resulted due to the definitive tripping of important transmission lines due to transient faults...|$|R
40|$|Wind energy being a {{renewable}} {{and environmental}} friendly has become {{important source of}} electrical power in recent years. As the wind power penetration increases day by day, it is required that wind turbines {{are connected to the}} grid actively to contribute in the system stability during and after grid faults. This paper focuses on a new topology, for reactive power compensation, voltage regulation and transient stability enhancement for wind turbines equipped with fixed-speed induction generators in large interconnected power systems. This study proposes an efficient control strategy to improve the low voltage ride through (LVRT) capability by using the pitch controller during <b>successful</b> <b>reclosing</b> of CBs. Besides the unsuccessful reclosing of circuit breakers, the performance of controller is also evaluated. Extensive simulations have been carried out with real wind speed data and different time durations, where the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is verified using power system simulator PSCAD/EMTDC...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{configuration}} and novel reclosing procedure of a distribution {{system with a}} battery energy storage system (BESS) used as an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) in a smart grid. The proposed new configurations of the distribution systems are the installation of a circuit breaker (CB) {{on both sides of}} the distribution line, the replacement of the recloser with a CB and protective relay, and the requirement of a communication method. The proposed reclosing procedure performs the reclosing of the CB at the load side and then judges the fault clearance using the load current. If the fault is cleared, the synchronism checking between the main source and the BESS is performed. After completing this, the CB at the main source side is reclosed. The smart grid environment, including a new distribution system, BESS, and reclosing method are modeled with the Electromagnetic Transients Program (EMTP) /ATPDraw. To verify the proposed method, the various simulations according to the fault clearance time are performed and analyzed. The simulation results show that the BESS can be operated as a UPS and <b>successful</b> <b>reclosing</b> is possible...|$|E
