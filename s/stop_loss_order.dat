40|$|We {{model the}} {{interactions}} between the trading activities of a large investor, the stock price and the market liquidity. Our framework generalizes the model of Frey (2000), where liquidity is constant by introducing a stochastic liquidity factor. This innovation has two implications. First, we can analyse trading strategies for the large investor that are affected by a changing market depth. Second, the sensitivity of stock process to the trading strategy of the large investor can vary due to changes in liquidity. Features of our model are demonstrated using Monte Carlo simulation for different scenarios. The flexibility of our framework is illustrated by an application that deals with the pricing of a liquidity derivative. The claim under consideration compensates a large investor who follows a stop loss strategy for the liquidity risk {{that is associated with}} a <b>stop</b> <b>loss</b> <b>order.</b> The derivative matures when the asset price falls below a stop loss limit {{for the first time and}} then pays the price difference between the asset price immediately before and after the execution of the <b>stop</b> <b>loss</b> <b>order.</b> The setup to price the liquidity derivative is calibrated for one example using real world limit order book data so that one gets an impression about the order of magnitude of the liquidity effect...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we suggest}} the {{authenticity}} of a distortion risk measurement strategy {{that can be used}} instead of the risk management slogan ‘Avoiding merging increases shortfall ’ which justifies the well known advice ‘ don’t put all your eggs in one basket’. There are lots of distortion risk measures like conditional value at risk (expected shortfall) or the Wang transform risk measure, in spite of being coherent they do not always provide incentive for risk management because of lack of giving a capital relief in some simple two scenarios situation of reduced risk. To prevent the existence of such pathological counter examples, we introduce a Weibull distortion measure that preserves the higher degree <b>stop</b> <b>loss</b> <b>order</b> and offer a capital relief...|$|E

50|$|The {{main risk}} is market risk as the {{contract}} is designed to pay {{the difference between the}} opening price and the closing price of the underlying asset. CFDs are traded on margin, and the leveraging effect of this increases the risk significantly. Margin rates are typically small and therefore a small amount of money can be used to hold a large position. It is this very risk that drives the use of CFDs, either to speculate on movements in financial markets or to hedge existing positions in other products. One of the ways to mitigate this risk is the use of <b>stop</b> <b>loss</b> <b>orders.</b> Users typically deposit an amount of money with the CFD provider to cover the margin and can lose much more than this deposit if the market moves against them.|$|R

Furthermore, it is the assessment of the Danish FSA that the method presented and applied by Saxo Bank to set the adjusted settlement prices for the clients affected contributes to equality of treatment between clients and is not biased towards the interests of the Bank. Therefore, the Danish FSA finds that the method is not in conflict with the regulations that a securities dealer must act honestly and professionally.”Saxo Bank commented: “We take notice that the FSA after a thorough investigation has stated that Saxo Bank’s handling of the events and the application of price adjustments has been consistent with the regulations on investor protection and that the Bank’s terms are not in conflict with the regulations that a financial intermediary must act honestly and professionally towards its clients.” ...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is the {{habitual}} speculator in commodity futures markets. The speculator's activity broadens a market, creates essential liquidity, and performs an irreplaceable pricing function. Working knowledge of the profiles and motivations of habitual speculators is essential to both market theorist and policy makers. Responses to a 73 question survey were collected directly from retail commodity brokers with offices in Alabama. Each questionnaire recorded information on an individual commodity client who had traded {{for an extended period of}} time. The typical trader studied is a married, white male, age 52. He is affluent and well educated. He is a self-employed business owner who can recover from financial setbacks. He is a politically right wing conservative involved in the political process. He assumes a good deal of risk in most phases of his life. He is both an aggressive investor and an active gambler. This trader does not consider preservation of his commodity capital to be a very high trading priority. As a result, he rarely uses <b>stop</b> <b>loss</b> <b>orders.</b> He wins more frequently than he loses (over 51 % of the time) but is an overall net loser in dollar terms.

40|$|This paper studies predatory trading, trading that induces and/or {{exploits}} {{the need}} of other investors to reduce their positions. We show that if one trader needs to sell, others also sell and subsequently buy back the asset. This leads to price overshooting and a reduced liquidation value for the distressed trader. Hence, the market is illiquid when liquidity is most needed. Further, a trader profits from triggering another trader’s crisis, and the crisis can spill over across traders and across markets. LARGE TRADERS FEAR A FORCED LIQUIDATION, especially if their need to liquidate is known by other traders. For example, hedge funds with (nearing) margin calls may need to liquidate, and this could be known to certain counterparties such as the bank financing the trade. Similarly, traders who use portfolio insurance, <b>stop</b> <b>loss</b> <b>orders,</b> or other risk management strategies can be known to liquidate in response to price drops; a short-seller may need to cover his position if the price increases significantly or if his share is recalled (i. e., a “short squeeze”); certain institutions {{have an incentive to}} liquidate bonds that are downgrade...|$|R

30|$|The tumultuous {{innovation}} rate in {{the world}} of blockchain inevitably draws most of the attention on the latest novelty. However, we believe it is crucial to broaden the perspective and consider the single platform as one element in the ecosystem of socio-technical systems we live in. The recent “flash crash” experienced by GDAX – one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges – is a good example to illustrate this. On June 21, 2017 the value of 1 ether – the digital currency of Ethereum – crashed from $ 320 to $ 0.1 for a few seconds. Although investigations are undergoing, the mainstream reporting explained that the crash was caused by a sell order at market price worth several million dollars, causing the exchange to accept bids at any price to fill the request, which in turn dropped the value of 1 ether to $ 224. Such a rapid change has triggered a cascade of hundreds of automatic margin calls and <b>stop</b> <b>loss</b> <b>orders</b> set by traders, which eventually have driven the price to $ 0.1 [7]. In summary, the event originated from a single major player – it was a centralised event. As simple as it seems, this is just an approximated description of what happened and placing Ethereum in a broader context is crucial to clarify the nature of the crash.|$|R

40|$|The {{disposition}} {{effect is}} an investment bias where investors hold stocks at a loss longer than stocks at a gain. This bias is associated with poorer investment performance and exhibited {{to a greater extent}} by investors with less experience and less sophistication. A method of managing susceptibility to the bias is through use of <b>stop</b> <b>losses.</b> Using the trading records of UK stock market individual investors from 2006 to 2009, this paper shows that <b>stop</b> <b>losses</b> used as part of investment decisions are an effective tool for inoculating against the disposition effect. We also show that investors who use <b>stop</b> <b>losses</b> have less experience and that, when not using <b>stop</b> <b>losses,</b> these investors are more reluctant to realise losses than other investors...|$|R
5000|$|A long squeeze is a {{situation}} in which investors who hold long positions feel the need to sell into a falling market to cut their losses. This pressure to sell usually leads to a further decline in market prices. This situation is less common than the opposite [...] "short squeeze", because in a short squeeze, the traders who have taken the short contracts have a legal obligation to settle with the promised shares. A trader who is 'long' in a long squeeze may well have no such obligation, but may sell out of fear. Other investors may see the rapid decline in price as irrational and a buying opportunity (more often than a rapid rise in price seen as a shorting opportunity). However, given recent significant market turmoil, long squeeze has become of more practical interest rather than merely a theoretical possibility. In 2008, Bear Stearns was wiped out after market rumors that the company had cash concerns. Investors started selling the scrip, resulting in a long squeeze, which triggered many other <b>stop</b> <b>order</b> <b>losses</b> and accelerated the decline of the company's stock.|$|R

50|$|Many {{employers}} seek {{to mitigate}} the financial risk of self funding claims under the plan by purchasing <b>stop</b> <b>loss</b> insurance from an insurance carrier. These policies typically provide for risk retention limitations both on a specific claim and aggregate claims basis. An important aspect of self funded group health plans lies in the requirement that the employer remain liable for funding of plan claims regardless of the purchase of <b>stop</b> <b>loss</b> insurance. What this means, in turn, is a fund or company's own bank account creates a pool of their employees and is managed & distributed to claim payouts. In other words, only the employer has a contractual relationship with plan participants and beneficiaries. The <b>stop</b> <b>loss</b> policy runs solely between the employer and the <b>stop</b> <b>loss</b> carrier and creates no direct liability to those individuals covered under the plan. This feature provides the critical distinction between fully insured plans (subject to State law insurance regulations) and self funded health plans which, under the provisions of Section 514 of ERISA, are exempt from state insurance regulations.|$|R

50|$|In health insurance, {{coinsurance}} {{is sometimes}} used synonymously with copayment, but copayment is fixed while the coinsurance is a percentage that the insurer pays after the insurance policy's deductible is exceeded, {{up to the}} policy's <b>stop</b> <b>loss.</b> It can be expressed {{as a pair of}} percentages with the insurer's portion stated first, or just a single percentage showing what the insured pays.

Once the insured's out-of-pocket expenses equal the <b>stop</b> <b>loss</b> the insurer will assume responsibility for 100% of any additional costs. 70-30, 80-20, and 90-10 insurer-insured coinsurance schemes are common, with <b>stop</b> <b>loss</b> limits of $1,000 to $3,000 after which the insurer covers all expenses.|$|R
