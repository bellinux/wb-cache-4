50|$|Most of {{the park}} {{consists}} of open flat grassed areas bordered by tree lined avenues, which act as wind breaks. Of the two ponds, the westernmost was {{the larger of the}} two and was more formal. It also featured a fountain. The pond nearest to Pitzhanger Manor on the eastward side {{of the park}} had <b>sunken</b> <b>sides,</b> which were planted with a mixture of ornamental shrubs and bushes. The pond itself was made to look as though it was a small gently flowing brook. A contemporary drawing of the manor house in the museum suggests that, at the time of Soane, this pond was much deeper. It was from its sides that John Soane and his friend William Turner (the artist) would sit and fish. As the grounds to the west were pastoral {{it is quite possible that}} this pond was constructed as a Ha-ha against cattle and sheep. The bridge at the north end, and the pond, were in existence before Soane bought the property but he had it decorated to give an appearance of great antiquity, no doubt to match his faux Roman ruins which he built just to the north of his house. It is a listed Grade II* structure.|$|E
5000|$|Throughout the 1950s the [...] "White Ladies" [...] ran on all {{the major}} express and limited stop {{services}} out of Lower Mosley Street, Manchester. In particular they served the routes due north including X3 & X13 to Great Harwood, X23 Clitheroe, X43 Skipton and Colne, X53 Burnley, and X66 Blackburn. The upper deck configuration of a <b>sunken</b> <b>side</b> aisle with four seats all together on one side was an unusual combination.

50|$|However, {{once it is}} {{understood}} that the planorbid shell is sinistral, if the shell is held with the aperture {{on the left and}} facing the observer, then the <b>sunken</b> spire <b>side</b> of the shell is uppermost. This is a convenience for understanding the shell, but is the opposite of the way the shell is actually carried in life.|$|R
5000|$|The site of {{the present}} car park south of the station {{occupied}} the {{site of the}} Port Erin arrive and departure platforms, a carriage siding, and the former goods yard - Roads 5 to 11 in the old station layout. Road 7 was used to store spare carriages to strengthen Port Erin line trains, whilst 8 to 11 formed the station's goods department. Reflecting the character of the island's freight traffic, there was a large goods shed, transshipment platform, and cattle dock, but no specialized facilities for handling coal traffic as relative little domestic coal was handled by the railway. There was also a <b>sunken</b> <b>siding</b> to load manure cleared from the streets of Douglas, and sold, by the railway to local farmers, especially in the Santon area, until the 1920s. This area was used to store redundant stock after the end of goods traffic in the 1960s.|$|R
50|$|At the House, at {{the middle}} of the slope is a small <b>sunken</b> patio, one <b>side</b> was carved into the rock forming two walls and the floor. In one corner is a fixed mortar.|$|R
50|$|Leaves are simple, not toothed, {{opposite}} on the stem; around 7 to 13 cm long. Oil dots seen {{in young}} growth, the thin elliptical leaves {{often have a}} prominent pointed tip. The mid-rib is raised on the lower leaf <b>side,</b> <b>sunken</b> on the top side. Lateral and net venation is clearly seen on both sides.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{visitors}} {{approach the}} gardens from the west, through a circus of flower gardens at street level around the [...] "Rosebowl" [...] fountain. Slopes and steps lead down {{from this area}} into the main area of the <b>sunken</b> gardens. Either <b>side</b> of the central avenue there are broad areas of lawn, interspersed with smaller borders filled with perennials, and another two large fountain pools.|$|R
5000|$|The earth banks {{on either}} side, {{sometimes}} topped with hedges and trees, {{can give the}} impression of a tunnel enclosing the traveller. Because the roadway is restricted by the banks on either <b>side,</b> <b>sunken</b> lanes typically admit the passage of only one vehicle; that is, they are single track roads. Occasional passing places may be provided, but a meeting of vehicles in a sunken lane often requires one party to reverse to a suitable passing place. In Central Germany, [...] "dual carriageways" [...] have been observed with two trenches side by side where a trackway was in such heavy use that it had lanes dedicated for each direction.|$|R
40|$|Glabrous annual 2 to {{12 inches}} tall. Ligules 1 / 16 to 1 / 8 inch long, {{slightly}} puberulent, entire. Blades < 1 / 16 inch broad, involute, to 1 inch long. Spike usually {{about half the}} height of the plant. Spikelets 1 / 8 to inch long (exclusive of the awn). Glumes usually reddish (purplish) -tinged, exceeding the lemma. Callus of the floret short-bearded. Lemma with a straight awn 1 / 16 to 1 / 8 inch long from a shortly bifid apex. Identification Tips: This taxon can be distinguished from all other grasses by its small size, reddish or purplish-tinged color, unbranched inflorescence with spikelets <b>sunken</b> into opposite <b>sides</b> of the stem. It is also the only member of its genus that occurs in our area. Phenology: Blooms April through May...|$|R
