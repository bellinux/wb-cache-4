40|$|Abstract — IETF’s {{integrated}} {{service with}} resource aggregation techniques provide {{a mechanism to}} reduce the RSVP states kept at router. Therefore, it reduces the number of RSVP refresh messages exchanged across routers. But the high frequency of <b>setup</b> <b>messages</b> exchanged between the edge routers can hinders the performance of aggregation. In this paper, {{we look at the}} management of the aggregation of resources over IP-in-IP tunnel with a view of reducing the <b>setup</b> <b>messages.</b> We develop and compare the cost functions of three aggregation control policies: the Temporal Operating Policy, the Cardinal Operating Policy, and the Resource Threshold Operating Policy. We also figure out the conditions under which the operating costs of these policies are minimum. Furthermore, we compare the performance of these policies under different conditions and shown that the Temporal Operating Policy will be more cost effective than the other two policies. I...|$|R

40|$|An ad hoc {{wireless}} {{mobile network}} is an infrastructure-less mobile network {{that has no}} fixed routers; instead, all nodes are capable of movement and can be connected dynamically in an arbitrary manner. In order to facilitate communication of mobile nodes {{that may not be}} within the wireless range of each other, an efficient routing protocol is used to discover routes between nodes so that messages may be delivered in a timely manner. In this paper, we present a novel Load-Balanced Ad hoc Routing (LBAR) protocol for communication in wireless ad hoc networks. LBAR defines a new metric for routing known as the degree of nodal activity to represent the load on a mobile node. In LBAR routing information on all paths from source to destination are forwarded through <b>setup</b> <b>messages</b> to the destination. <b>Setup</b> <b>messages</b> include nodal activity information of all nodes on the traversed path. After collecting information on all possible paths, the destination then makes a selection of the path with the best-cost value and sends an acknowledgement to the source node. LBAR also provides an alternate path maintenance technique to patch up broken links by detouring traffic to the destination. A comprehensive simulation study was conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme. Performance results show that LBAR outperforms existing ad hoc routing protocols in terms of packet delivery and average end-to-end delay...|$|R

The main advantage of these checksum cords is that they spread the addresses of possible router messages across a spectrum that is too large for the attacker to easily create messages that collide with legitimate messages. Our methods therefore scale to attack trees containing hundreds of routers and do not require that a victim know the topology of the attack tree apriori.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a new hybrid optical burst switch {{architecture}} (HOBS) that {{takes advantage of the}} pre-transmission idle time during lightpath establishment. In dynamic circuit switching (wavelength routing) networks, capacity is immediately hard-reserved upon the arrival of a <b>setup</b> <b>message</b> at a node, but it is used at least a round-trip time delay later. This waste of resources is significant in optical multi-gigabit networks and can be used to transmit traffic of a lower class of service in a non-competing way. The proposed hybrid OBS architecture, takes advantage of this idle time to transmit one-way optical bursts of a lower class of service, while high priority data explicitly requests and establishes end-to-end lightpaths. In the proposed scheme, the two control planes (two-way and one-way OBS reservation) are merged, in the sense that each <b>SETUP</b> <b>message,</b> used for the two-way lightpath establishment, is associated with one-way burst transmission and therefore it is modified to carry routing and overhead information for the one-way traffic as well. In this paper, we present the main architectural features of the proposed hybrid scheme and further we assess its performance by conducting simulation experiments on the NSF net backbone topology. The extensive network study revealed that the proposed hybrid architecture can achieve and sustain an adequate burst transmission rate with a finite worst case delay. c © 2007 Elsevier B. V.

The performance analysis considers five resource reservation protocols, Just-In-Time (JIT), JumpStart, JIT+, Just-Enough-Time (JET) and Horizon, and focuses on the following topologies: degree-four chordal rings, mesh-torus, and the European Optical Network (EON). Among those topologies, D 4 T(1, 19, 3, 9) leads to the best performance, while the worst performance is observed for EON. It is shown that the burst loss probability increases with the increase of the control packet processing time. It is also shown that values of OXC configuration time smaller than lms does not have impact on the network performance, independently of the network topology or the resource reservation protocol.

40|$|Abstract. The dining cryptographers network (or DC-net) is {{a seminal}} {{technique}} devised by Chaum {{to solve the}} dining cryptographers problem — namely, how to send a boolean-OR bit anonymously {{from a group of}} participants. In this paper, we investigate the weaknesses of DC-nets, study alternative methods and propose a new way to tackle this problem. Our protocol, Anonymous Veto Network (or AV-net), overcomes all the major limitations of DC-nets, including the complex key <b>setup,</b> <b>message</b> collisions and susceptibility to disruptions. While DC-nets are unconditionally secure, AV-nets are computationally secure under the Decision Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption. An AV-net is more efficient than other techniques based on the same public-key primitives. It requires only two rounds of broadcast and the least computational load and bandwidth usage per participant. Furthermore, it provides the strongest protection against collusion — only full collusion can breach the anonymity of message senders. ...|$|E
40|$|In this study, a {{novel and}} generic {{signalling}} method is proposed {{that results in}} {{a significant reduction in}} signalling messages exchanged between a user equipment and the network over the air interface. Reduction of signalling messages in future mobile cellular systems is an important issue because of the current trend of deploying smaller cells while achieving higher than expected data area capacities. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this method within the standard constraints, some signalling procedures of the 3 rd generation mobile standard, Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS), are investigated. In one application, the number of UMTS packet switch call <b>setup</b> <b>messages</b> was reduced down to three messages only. In such a scenario, measurements show that the gains in comparison with prior call setup is 61 % in the duration of the call setup, 50 % in the downlink processing delays, 93 % in the downlink radio power transmission and 79 % in the uplink radio power transmission...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} interdomain resource reservation {{through a}} third-party agent called a Bandwidth Management Point (BMP). The BMP of each domain {{is responsible for}} admission control, dynamic bandwidth provisioning, DSCP assignment, policy control, etc. We also propose that each domain be free to choose its own intradomain resource reservation protocol. This model solves two significant problems of today's Internet: interdomain dynamic resource provisioning, and scalability of the backbone. The BMP makes bulk reservations with each possible destination domain on behalf of hosts in its domain, and end hosts can join or leave the reservation without being involved with communication protocol between the domains. Reservations {{are based on the}} destination domain IP prefix and DSCP, and are dynamically updated according to aggregated traffic demand. Thus, unlike RSVP, the number of control states that backbone routers keep and the number of reservation <b>setup</b> <b>messages</b> between domains are reduced linearly with the number of domains. Since individual hosts are not involved with the interdomain reservation process, there is a corresponding saving in time...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} a new scheme for on demand {{reservation}} of capacity in OBS networks, emulating one-way signaling protocols. The proposed framework {{relies on the}} combination of a two-way reservation protocol and a burst assembly scheme with a burstification delay enforced to be the round-trip-time and which incorporates a Least Mean Square filter to predict burst length. Upon the arrival of the first packet in the burst queue, a control packet (<b>setup</b> <b>message)</b> is generated and transmitted to reserve resources, based on the prediction filter. In this way the reservation process starts/ends simultaneously with the burst assembly process. In this paper, we present the main features of the proposed scheme, evaluate its performance for both homogeneous and non-homogeneous traffic and we further propose an extension with aggressive over-provisioning of resources that can guarantee lossless operation even for extremely cases of bursty traffic.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we present}} a new hybrid {{switching}} architecture, termed as SLIP-IN, that combines electronic packet/burst with optical circuit switching.

For this purpose, we have developed an extensive network simulator, where the basic features of the architecture were modeled.

This paper investigates the effect of control packet (<b>setup</b> <b>message)</b> processing time and optical switch configuration time {{on the performance of}} OBS mesh networks for E-JIT protocol. A performance assessment of E-JIT is presented in comparison with Just-in-Time (JIT) protocol for the following mesh optical burst switching networks: degree-three and degree-four chordal rings, Mesh-torus, NSFNET, ARPANET, and the European Optical Network (EON). Among those topologies, for topologies with nodal degree around three D 3 T(1, 19, 7) leads to the best performance, while the worst performance is observed for ARPANET. For network topologies with nodal degree around four, D 4 T(1, 19, 3, 9) leads to the best performance and the worst is presented by EON.

40|$|Project (M. S., Computer Science) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2010. Oracle Advanced Queuing (AQ) is a queue {{management}} {{facility for}} Oracle Databases. Oracle Streams AQ enables user applications to enqueue messages into a queue, ande subsequently dequeued by subscribers or recipients. A queue can contain {{a message of}} a particular type or of a generic type ???SYS. AnyData???. Oracle AQ can track, preserve, document, query, filter, and transform queued messages. In particular, messages are processed using the core Oracle SQL processing engine, meaning that messages are managed as persistent (transactional) or buffered (non-transactional) table rows. Enqueued messages can be handled using either single or multiple queues, and thus, there will be performance {{differences between the two}} setups. Our simulations were limited to persistent messaging. In the single queue <b>setup</b> all <b>messages</b> are handled by one queue. In the multiple queues <b>setup,</b> <b>messages</b> are distributed among queues each of which handle a different message type. The simulation results from the single queue setup and the results from the implementation of single queue setup in Oracle were compared. The comparison showed that the simulation was accurate. The data from the single queue simulation was studied and used as a benchmark to build a three queue setup simulation. The results of this simulation were then compared with the first simulation for performance enhancements. The project discusses the methods in which the simulation models (written in GPSS) were created, how the implementation in Oracle was achieved and how the results were gathered and compared.

In the IS- 41 approach, features are handled in three ways: by the HLR upon receiving a LOCREQ, a serving MSC upon receiving a ROUTEREQ, {{or by the}} serving MSC upon receiving a connection <b>setup</b> <b>message.</b> For example, unconditional call forwarding and selective call acceptance are features handled by the HLR upon receiving a LOCREQ, call forwarding on busy is handled by the serving MSC during ROUTEREQ, and call forwarding on no-answer or no response to page are triggered at the serving MSC during connection setup. For features handled by the serving MSCs, only service triggers are downloaded. Any data associated with the service is retained in the HLR. For example, call forwarding on no-answer is triggered at the serving MSC if the user does not answer after connection is setup. However, the forwarded number is stored in the HLR. Retrieval of this data requires messaging to the HLR. This approach is well-suited for some features that have large amounts of associated data. For example, speed dial may require the HLR to download {{a large amount of}} data if the mobile user has a large database of numbers. Such downloading and subsequent movements to new VLRs as the end point moves will generate a high signaling load. The cost of extra messaging during call/connection setup delay may be a small penalty in comparison to this increased signaling load. On the other hand, for features with small amounts of data, such as a forwarded number for call forwarding on no-answer, the increased call/connection setup delay associated with increased messaging may be more costly than the increased signaling load caused by downloading thi...|$|E

VDTNs handle non-real time applications using vehicles to carry messages on their buffers, relaying them only when a proper contact opportunity occurs. Therefore, the network performance is directly affected by the storage capacity and message retrieving of intermediate nodes. This paper proposes a suitable content storage and retrieval (CSR) mechanism for VDTN networks. This CSR solution adds additional information on control labels of the <b>setup</b> <b>message</b> associated to the corresponding data bundle (aggregated traffic) that defines and applies caching and forwarding restrictions on network traffic (data bundles). Furthermore, this work presents a performance analysis and evaluation of CSR mechanisms over a VDTN application scenario, using a VDTN testbed. This work presents the comparison of the network behavior and performance using two DTN routing protocols, Epidemic and Spray and Wait, with and without CSR mechanisms. The results show that CSR mechanisms improve the performance of VDTN networks significantly.
