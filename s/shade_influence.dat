40|$|Jussara palm (Euterpe edulis) is {{a native}} plant of the Atlantic rainy forest, with large {{economic}} interest. The species is shade-tolerant and currently it is restricted to certain areas of difficult access. The {{most effective way to}} reintroduce it into the environment or increase the population density for conservation and commercial exploitation is promoting seed propagation. Considering that the jussara palm is an ombrophylous species, this experiment aimed to simulate forest conditions, with different shade levels, to analyze its influence on seed germination. After processing the seeds (depulping), 500 seeds were sown in containers (20 x 30 x 8 cm) filled with forest ground and grown in five shade levels (0, 20, 40, 60, and 80 %, simulated using black shadenet). The experimental design was blocks at random, with four 25 -seed replications. We evaluated the percentage of seed germination and the Emergence Speed Index (ESI). Seed germination started 103 days after sowing. Although the percentage of germinated seeds in the different treatments varied between 53 (0 % shade) and 72 % (60 % shade), there was no significant <b>shade</b> <b>influence</b> over percentage of seed germination and ESI...|$|E

The physiologically equivalent temperature PET was used to quantify the level of human thermal comfort. The lower PET values under the tree canopies point out the lower level of thermal stress compared to an adjacent site, which was not directly shaded. The total radiation heat aggregated in the mean radiant temperature Tmrt mainly determined the PET conditions at both sites, which is typical of Central European cities on summer days. To a considerable extent, Tmrt was influenced by the long-wave radiative fluxes from the four main horizontal directions.

A correct design of shading systems can lead to sensitive energy savings especially during the summer months. In this paper, in order to investigate how <b>shading</b> <b>influences</b> the building energy need, a sensitivity analysis of the monthly shading factor was carried out. The calculation of the shading factor was performed with a model capable of accounting for complex boundary conditions, such as a horizon profile, generic-shaped obstructions and vegetation. Through the ANOVA-FAST technique, the building design variables which have the highest impact on the variance of the shading factor were evaluated {{for a set of}} urban external contexts and geographic locations. The design variables that were considered for the sensitivity analysis are related to the geometrical features of shadow-casting objects (overhangs, fins, parts of the building itself, etc.). The geometry of surrounding buildings was taken into account for the characterisation of the urban context.

40|$|It is {{difficult}} to separate the effects of light reduction versus nutrient and water competition in agroforestry systems. The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the effect of shading and fertilizer supply on the vegetative development and yield of Coffea arabica over six years. The coffee trees were covered with shade screens (photosynthetically active radiation reduction up to 48 %) and fertilized from 100 to 40 % of the recommended amount from 2001 on. Leaf area, number of leaves, number of nodes, leaf area per branch and, yield were determined. Although no effect of fertilization was found, <b>shading</b> <b>influenced</b> the number of nodes, leaf area and production from the third year on. The number of nodes and yield decreased as shading increased. The effect of the yield bienniallity was more evident in the unshaded trees, which yielded an average of 2, 646 kg ha¹. The trees under 48 % shading yielded an average of 2, 094 kg ha¹. After 2004 the leaf area per branch increased as the shade increased, {{at the end of}} both the maximum and minimum growth periods. During the first three years, the coffee trees do not change their vegetative or productive characteristics as a response to shading. The shade effects become more intense after the beginning of the higher yield period. The shaded coffee trees have a larger leaf area and a smaller number of nodes than the coffee trees under full sun.

40|$|Background and Aims: Intercropping systems contain {{two or more}} species {{simultaneously}} in close proximity. Due to contrasting features of the component crops, quantification of the light environment and photosynthetic productivity is extremely difficult. However it is {{an essential component of}} productivity. Here, a low-tech but high resolution method is presented that can be applied to single and multi-species cropping systems, to facilitate characterisation of the light environment. Different row layouts of an intercrop consisting of Bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranea (L.) Verdc.) and Proso millet (Panicum miliaceum) have been used as an example and the new opportunities presented by this approach have been analysed. Methods: Three-dimensional plant reconstruction, based on stereocameras, combined with ray-tracing was implemented to explore the light environment within the Bambara groundnut-Proso millet intercropping system and associated monocrops. Gas exchange data was used to predict the total carbon gain of each component crop. Key Results: The <b>shading</b> <b>influence</b> of the tall Proso millet on the shorter Bambara groundnut results in a reduction in total canopy light interception and carbon gain. However, the increased leaf area index (LAI) of Proso millet, higher photosynthetic potential due to the C 4 pathway and sub-optimal photosynthetic acclimation of Bambara groundnut to shade means that increasing the number of rows of millet will lead to greater light interception and carbon gain per unit ground area, despite Bambara groundnut intercepting more light per unit leaf area. Conclusions: Three-dimensional reconstruction combined with ray tracing provides a novel, accurate method of exploring the light environment within an intercrop that does not require difficult measurements of light interception and data-intensive manual reconstruction, especially for such systems with inherently high spatial possibilities. It provides new opportunities for calculating potential productivity within multispecies cropping systems; enables the quantification of dynamic physiological differences between crops grown as monoculture and those within intercrops or; enables the prediction of new productive combinations of previously untested crops...|$|R

With binocular viewing, stereo information {{has been shown to}} improve shape discrimination even when rich monocular cues are present. This study used cue conflict conditions to test the relative contributions of stereo and shading information to 3 D shape perception. We generated binocular images for which the shape specified by shading in each eye’s view was different from the shape specified by binocular disparities. Observers performed shape discrimination comparing these cue conflict stimuli to stimuli with consistent shading and stereo, or to stimuli that provided stereo information but no shading. We also measured the baseline discriminability of pairs of objects using consistent cue stimuli. Subjectively, the shading variations in cue conflict stimuli often appeared as variations in surface reflectance rather than solely effects of illumination. Despite this inconsistent percept, shading had a strong influence on shape discrimination. A pair of stimuli was more likely to be judged the same when shading information was consistent than when stereo information was consistent. <b>Shading</b> also <b>influenced</b> comparisons to shapes that were defined only by stereo. The results demonstrate that shading information has a strong influence on 3 D shape discrimination even when conflicting stereo information is present, and when shading is not entirely attributed to illumination effects.

40|$|According to Sverdrup's (1953) {{model of}} the spring bloom, {{phytoplankton}} biomass decreases in winter when the mixed layer depth exceeds the critical depth. We have used a one-dimensional mathematical model integrated by the Lagrangian Ensemble method to simulate a population of diatoms during the winter between two growing seasons off the Azores. The model allows us to diagnose the demographic changes in the simulated diatom population {{from a variety of}} perspectives. The total population falls to a minimum of 70 million diatoms m- 2 at the end of February. The vertical distribution of the population dynamics is first analysed in terms of daily Eulerian averages over 1 m depth intervals. Growth starts in February when the diurnal thermocline becomes shallower than 50 m, but while the mixed layer is still 200 m deep. The natural mortality has a minimum in winter because it is reduced (in the model) with temperature and population density. Eulerian analysis suggests that in winter, diatoms have a life expectancy of more than 3 months, so a significant number will survive the months of December, January and February when there is very little growth. Losses to grazing are negligible in winter. Lagrangian analysis shows how an individual diatom responds to its changing ambient environment caused by variation in depth (due to turbulent mixing) and the diurnal and seasonal changes in the photosynthetically active radiance. The different trajectories followed by the thousands of plankton particles simulated by the model produce diversity in growth rate ranging over several orders of magnitude, so care has to be taken in statistical analysis. The paper ends with a re-assessment {{of the value of the}} critical depth and compensation depth as predictors for onset of the spring bloom. The compensation depth was computed by Eulerian averaging over 1 m depth inter-vals each day. For 1 month after the vernal equinox the compensation depth follows the ascent of the mixed layer as it rises from a depth of 100 m to 40 m. Lagrangian analysis reveals that this is due to the photo-adaptation better matching the ambient irradiance experienced by diatoms in the mixed layer compared with those at the same depth in the seasonal thermo-cline. By mid-April the spring bloom has already ad-vanced so far that self <b>shading</b> <b>influences</b> the compensation depth, which then rises into the mixed layer.

A scale of 1 - 5 was used with 1 as no bronzing and 5 as severe bronzing (more than 50 percent leaf area bronzed). Results suggest that bronzing severity increased when plants were shaded and decreased when plants were under moisture stress. These treatment trends occurred at a similar rate for the 3 var., but the degree of bronzing was influenced by the var. Irrigation and <b>shade</b> treatments apparently <b>influenced</b> stomatal opening and the length of exposure to pollutants. (CIAT...|$|R
30|$|One of the {{greatest}} changes associated with clear-cut harvesting to the stream edge is the increase in light levels (Allan and Castillo 2009). Post-harvest light levels of 11 to 88 % (compared with an open reference site) have been recorded in New Zealand streams {{in the first few}} years after harvest with marked increases in light occurring at stream widths of around 3.5 to 5  m. Residual shade was provided by stream banks, logging slash, surrounding topography and any remaining vegetation. In some instances, residual logging slash across the stream channel resulted in light levels similar to those found in un-harvested streams (< 5 % of available light) (Davies-Colley and Quinn 1998; Thompson et al. 2009). Time frames for <b>shade</b> recovery were <b>influenced</b> by stream size and riparian vegetation regrowth (Baillie et al. 2005; Boothroyd et al. 2004; Davies-Colley and Quinn 1998; Thompson et al. 2009).|$|R
40|$|The prime goal of {{professionals}} in the built environment is to develop cost effective sustainable buildings which contribute to the attainment of climate change mitigation goals, facilitate the achievement of indoor thermal comfort and reduction of building energy demand. This work focuses on the viability of passive solar design strategies of UK conservatories and shows that passive solar energy utilization in building design {{can contribute to the}} reduction of dwelling energy consumption and enhancement of indoor thermal comfort. Synergetic passive design strategies that seek to optimize solar energy gains through thermal simulation analysis of design criteria of varying future climatic conditions, variable occupant behaviour, building orientation, adequate provision of thermal mass, advance glazing, appropriate ventilation and sufficient level of <b>shading</b> which <b>influence</b> the potential thermal performance of conservatory is performed. The balance energy benefits of reduction of energy consumption through the application of these principles of passive solar design for space heating in winter and the challenge of reducing excessive solar gains in summer is analysed using the CIBSE adaptive thermal comfort criteria and statistical methods of the data collected from the thermal simulation. The results show that the judicious integrated of the passive solar design strategies in conservatories with increasing conservatory size in elongated south facing orientation with an aspect ratio of at least 1. 67 could progressively decrease annual energy consumption, building emission rate and annual gas consumption when the conservatory is neither heated nor air-conditioned...|$|R
