5|$|The M249 <b>SAW</b> <b>was</b> {{not used}} heavily before the 1991 Gulf War, {{though it has}} been used in every major U.S. {{conflict}} since. American personnel in Somalia in 1993, Bosnia in 1994, Kosovo in 1999, Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq since 2003 have been issued M249s. Surplus weapons were donated to Bolivia, Colombia and Tunisia.|$|E
5|$|After the {{financial}} success of Saw, a sequel was immediately green-lit. Leigh Whannell and James Wan were busy preparing {{for their next}} film and were unable to write or direct. Bousman wrote a script called The Desperate before <b>Saw</b> <b>was</b> released and {{was looking for a}} producer but many studios rejected it. Hoffman received the script and showed it to his partners Mark Burg and Oren Koules. It was decided that, with some changes, it could be made into Saw II. Whannell became available to provide rewrites of the script. The film was given a larger budget and was shot from May to June 2005 in Toronto.|$|E
25|$|Mini and micro {{table saws}} have a blade {{diameter}} of 4 inches (100 mm) and under. Mini table <b>saws</b> <b>are</b> typically 4 inch, while micro table <b>saws</b> <b>are</b> less than 4 inch, although {{the naming of}} the <b>saws</b> <b>is</b> not well defined.|$|R
50|$|Abrasive <b>saws</b> <b>are</b> often {{water-cooled}} {{and most}} ring <b>saws</b> <b>are</b> designed to enable this, with water pumps or drip feeds, and catch trays.|$|R
5000|$|A wire <b>saw</b> <b>is</b> a <b>saw</b> {{that uses}} a metal wire or cable for cutting. Industrial wire <b>saws</b> <b>are</b> usually powered. There are also hand-powered survivalist wire saws {{suitable}} for cutting branches. Wire <b>saws</b> <b>are</b> classified as continuous (or endless, or loop) or oscillating (or reciprocating). Sometimes the wire itself {{is referred to as}} a [...] "blade".|$|R
5|$|Aristo {{was born}} in Jakarta in 1976. As a child, he became {{interested}} in film {{when he and his}} family went to the movie theatre together; in an interview with Tabloid Nova, he recalled that one of the first films he <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> a comedy starring Warkop. After beginning junior high school in 1988, he began to go to the theatres to watch films on his own. Despite his enjoyment of film, he was initially active in an indie band.|$|E
5|$|As the {{campaign}} unfolded, Krueger was pressured by MacArthur to capture Manila. He sent messages reporting what he <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> {{a lack of}} drive among the troops, and even moved his theater headquarters forward of Krueger's. MacArthur tried to exploit Krueger's rivalry with Eichelberger by allowing the latter's Eighth Army to conduct its own drive on Manila from the south. Krueger eventually sent a flying column from the 1st Cavalry Division, but MacArthur's expectation that the Japanese would not defend Manila was proven incorrect. Weeks of ferocious fighting were required to capture the city.|$|E
5|$|Family {{and family}} history also plays an {{important}} role in the poem. Eliot found information on his family from Sketch of the Eliot Family, which described how Eliot's family lived in East Coker for 200 years. When Andrew Eliott left, he disrupted the family history. Similarly, Eliot broke from his own family when he travelled away from his family, a family that he <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> declining. Within the poem, Eliot emphasizes the need for a journey and the need for inward change.|$|E
50|$|A {{piercing}} saw, {{also known}} as a jeweler's <b>saw,</b> <b>is</b> a type of saw commonly used in jewelry making on sheet metal. It is usually used on softer metals as the <b>saw</b> <b>is</b> delicate.|$|R
50|$|A Gigli <b>saw</b> <b>is</b> a {{flexible}} wire saw used by surgeons for bone cutting. A Gigli <b>saw</b> <b>is</b> used mainly for amputation, where the bones {{have to be}} smoothly cut {{at the level of}} amputation.|$|R
50|$|A sally <b>saw</b> <b>is</b> a portable, mechanical, {{motorized}} <b>saw.</b> It <b>was</b> made obsolete by {{the invention}} of the chainsaw.|$|R
5|$|On {{sighting}} land, {{the crew}} persuaded the Malagasy {{that what they}} <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> a part of Madagascar the mutineers were unfamiliar with: after further subterfuge by the crew, the Malagasy set Meermin to drift towards the shore at Struisbaai. But the sea was rough, {{and one of the}} ship's masts was cut down to improve her balance. Meermin eventually grounded on a sandbank, by which time a militia consisting of local farmers and burghers had been formed onshore, who had observed that the ship was flying no flags, which they recognised as a distress signal. The militia killed or captured those of the Malagasy who ventured ashore, and then organised the removal into custody of all Malagasy remaining on the ship, under the command of a magistrate from Stellenbosch. Meermin was assessed as beyond recovery, and left to break up where she grounded.|$|E
5|$|<b>Saw</b> <b>was</b> first {{screened}} on January 19, 2004. Lionsgate {{picked up}} the rights and released the film in the United States and Canada on October 29, 2004. Critical responses were generally mixed and divided, but the film gained a cult following. Compared to its low budget, Saw performed very well at the box office, grossing more than $100 million worldwide and becoming, at the time, {{one of the most}} profitable horror films since 1996's Scream. The success of the film prompted a green-light of a sequel soon after Saw opening weekend, which was released the following October.|$|E
5|$|The Hungry Saw is {{the seventh}} studio album by British {{alternative}} band Tindersticks, released on 28 April 2008 by Beggars Banquet Records. Following {{the release of}} the band's sixth album, Waiting for the Moon in 2003, Tindersticks had entered an extended hiatus before reconvening to perform at the Don't Look Back event in September 2006. This concert marked the final performance of the original line-up of the band, and three members left the group shortly afterwards. The remaining members of Tindersticks felt reinvigorated by the performance, and relocated to France to begin working on new material in the summer of 2007, recording and producing the album at their own Le Chien Chanceaux studio in Limousin. The Hungry <b>Saw</b> <b>was</b> the first new Tindersticks material in five years.|$|E
5000|$|A swing <b>saw</b> <b>is</b> {{used for}} cross cutting wood in a sawmill, or for cutting ice {{off of a}} frozen body of waters. The <b>saw</b> <b>is</b> hung on a {{swinging}} arm, sometimes with a counterbalance weight.|$|R
50|$|<b>Saws</b> <b>were</b> {{at first}} {{serrated}} {{materials such as}} flint, obsidian, sea shells and shark teeth.In ancient Egypt, open (unframed) saws made of copper are documented {{as early as the}} Early Dynastic Period, circa 3,100-2,686 BC. Many copper <b>saws</b> <b>were</b> found in tomb No. 3471 dating to the reign of Djer in the 31st century BC. <b>Saws</b> have <b>been</b> used for cutting a variety of materials, including people (see Death by sawing). Models of <b>saws</b> have <b>been</b> found in many contexts throughout Egyptian history. Particularly useful are tomb wall illustrations of carpenters at work that show sizes and the use of different types. Egyptian <b>saws</b> <b>were</b> at first serrated, hardened copper which cut on both pull and push strokes. As the <b>saw</b> developed, teeth <b>were</b> raked to cut only on the pull stroke and set with the teeth projecting only on one side, rather than in the modern fashion with an alternating set. <b>Saws</b> <b>were</b> also made of bronze and later iron. In the Iron Age, frame <b>saws</b> <b>were</b> developed holding the thin blades in tension. The earliest known sawmill is the Roman Hierapolis sawmill from the third century AD and <b>was</b> for <b>sawing</b> stone.|$|R
50|$|Carbide <b>saws</b> <b>are</b> {{machine tools}} for cutting. The <b>saw</b> teeth <b>are</b> made of {{cemented}} carbide, so that hard materials can be cut.|$|R
5|$|Celestial bodies {{interior}} to {{the orbit}} of Mercury have been hypothesized, and searched for, for centuries. The German astronomer Christoph Scheiner thought he had seen small bodies passing {{in front of the}} Sun in 1611, but these were later shown to be sunspots. In the 1850s, Urbain Le Verrier made detailed calculations of Mercury's orbit and found a small discrepancy in the planet's perihelion precession from predicted values. He postulated that the gravitational influence of a small planet or ring of asteroids within {{the orbit of}} Mercury would explain the deviation. Shortly afterward, an amateur astronomer named Edmond Lescarbault claimed to have seen Le Verrier's proposed planet transit the Sun. The new planet was quickly named Vulcan but was never seen again, and the anomalous behaviour of Mercury's orbit was explained by Einstein's general theory of relativity in 1915. The vulcanoids take their name from this hypothetical planet. What Lescarbault <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> probably another sunspot.|$|E

25|$|During this time, Tabitha King was {{inspired}} to redesign his studio. King visited the space while his books and belongings were packed away. What he <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> an image of what his studio would look like if he died, providing a seed for his novel Lisey's Story (2006).|$|E
40|$|The chain <b>saw</b> <b>is</b> one of {{the most}} useful and timesaving power tools ever made. It is also {{one of the}} most dangerous. A chain <b>saw</b> should <b>be</b> picked for the main cutting jobs it is to do. Since the bar <b>saw</b> <b>is</b> the type best suited for general use, this {{publication}} is written for bar-type chain saws. Considerations in the selection, operation, and maintenance of bar <b>saws</b> <b>are</b> included. Since there is considerable variation among saws and their use, the reader is advised to study details about a specific brand and model in the owner's manual. Follow the manual's suggested operating instructions...|$|R
50|$|A modern bow <b>saw</b> <b>is</b> a metal-framed {{crosscut}} {{saw in the}} shape of a bow with a coarse wide blade. This type of <b>saw</b> <b>is</b> also known as a Swede saw, Finn saw or buck <b>saw.</b> It <b>is</b> a rough tool that can be used for cross-cutting branches or firewood (maybe up to 6 inches in diameter) down to size.|$|R
5000|$|A {{reciprocating}} <b>saw</b> <b>is</b> {{also called}} a hackzall saw when it accepts both Hackzall and Sawzall style blades.

25|$|Blackdown Mill is a three-storey smock mill on a {{single-storey}} brick base. It {{originally had}} Kentish-style cap, winded by a fantail. When last working for trade she had four patent sails. The mill drove {{two pairs of}} overdrift millstones, with a third pair worked by engine. A <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> also worked by the mill.|$|E
25|$|The first bit {{of action}} it <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> {{on the morning}} of 10 December. Squadron Leader Kale, and Flying Officer P.

A little later, the base was given a P-12 Radar, causing the Pakistani Air Force to avoid Uttarlai.|$|E
25|$|The first musical she <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> Lionel Bart's Fings Ain't Wot They Used T'Be {{as some of}} {{her fellow}} {{students}} were performing in it. The school would send students for auditions regularly, which led to an audition for the original London production of Bye Bye Birdie, although she wasn't offered a role. She also auditioned for Oscar Hammerstein II for The Sound of Music, but being overcome by shyness, spoke very quietly. She wasn't cast in the show.|$|E
5000|$|Cordwood <b>saws</b> <b>were</b> once {{very popular}} in rural America. They were used to cut smaller wood into {{firewood}} {{in an era when}} hand powered <b>saws</b> <b>were</b> the only other option. Logs too large for a cordwood <b>saw</b> <b>were</b> still cut by hand. Chainsaws [...] have largely replaced cordwood saws for firewood preparation today. Still, some commercial firewood processors and others use cordwood saws to save wear and tear on their chainsaws. Most people consider cordwood saws unsafe and outdated technology.|$|R
5000|$|... musical <b>saw</b> <b>is</b> a {{flexible}} handsaw played by {{holding the handle}} between the knees and bending the blade while bowing along the flat edge. The musical <b>saw</b> <b>is</b> found in the folk music of Russia and rural America, and is a popular vaudeville instrument.|$|R

25|$|The Breton-Prétot {{machine was}} a saw {{designed}} {{to cut the}} barbed wire protecting enemy trenches of World War I. The first version consisted of a small circular saw, driven by a six hp engine, attached to a long lever that was placed on a small cart with four wheels, {{that had to be}} pushed towards its objective. Breton proposed the machine to the French government in November 1914 and a prototype was tried in January 1915, when it was shown that the system in this form had little practicality. The use of caterpillar tracks was discussed that same month, but since none was available at that time, the system was then mounted at Liancourt {{on the back of a}} Bajac tractor in an attempt to obtain all-terrain mobility, towards the end of February 1915. The small circular <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> replaced by a large vertical saw with thirteen teeth, but a larger horizontal circular <b>saw</b> <b>was</b> added, just above ground level to cut the barbed-wire poles. In July the system was again changed, the horizontal saw being left out and large deflection shields being placed to protect the wheels. Eight small bronze cannon were used as simulation weights.|$|E
25|$|Min Saw {{grew up in}} {{the shadow}} of his two step-brothers, who viewed Min Saw as their {{youngest}} brother and allowed him to retain his princely status at the court. Min Saw and his mother attended Kunhsaw, and lived nearby the monastery. In 1038, Kyiso died, and was succeeded by Sokkate. Min <b>Saw</b> <b>was</b> loyal to the new king. He took wives, and had at least two sons (Saw Lu and Kyansittha) by the early 1040s.|$|E
25|$|On June 30, 2007, 125 {{days after}} the season premiere, at the Araneta Coliseum, Beatriz <b>Saw</b> <b>was</b> {{declared}} the Big Winner of the second season, besting 15 other housemates. She garnered about 1.5 million votes, or 30.29% {{of the total number}} of votes. This alone surpasses Kim Chiu's record for the most number of votes earned by a Big Winner. Saw received a million of pesos, and other prizes which includes a house and lot, a kitchen showcase, a brand new car, a business franchise, and package tours.|$|E
50|$|Today, head <b>saws</b> <b>are</b> mostly {{used for}} cutting logs 16 to 72 inches in {{diameter}} depending upon the type of band mill the <b>saws</b> <b>are</b> mounted on.
