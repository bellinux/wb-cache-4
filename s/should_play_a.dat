For his services to cricket he was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in 1981 and the Australian Sports Medal posthumously in 2000.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Egyptian Islam was {{a complex and}} diverse religion. Although Muslims agreed on the faith's basic tenets, the country's various social groups and classes applied Islam {{differently}} in their daily lives. The literate theologians of Al-Azhar University generally rejected the version of Islam practiced by illiterate religious preachers and peasants in the countryside. Most upper- and upper-middle-class Muslims believed either that religious expression was a private matter for each individual or that Islam <b>should</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> more dominant role in public life. Islamic religious revival movements, whose appeal cut across class lines, were present in most cities and in many villages.|$|E

25|$|The Shia Ismaili {{caliphate}} of the Fatimids made Egypt their center, {{and made}} Cairo their capital. Egypt's various social groups and classes apply Islam differently {{in their daily}} lives. The literate theologians of Al-Azhar generally reject the popular version of Islam practised by religious preachers and peasants in the countryside, which is heavily Sufi-influenced. Sufism has flourished in Egypt since Islam was first adopted.

25|$|When he was {{appointed}}, {{all other}} justices {{had been appointed}} by Democrats, Franklin D. Roosevelt or Truman, and all were committed New Deal liberals. But they disagreed about {{the role that the}} courts should play in achieving liberal goals. The Court was split between two warring factions. Felix Frankfurter and Robert H. Jackson led one faction, which insisted upon judicial self-restraint and insisted courts should defer to the policymaking prerogatives of the White House and Congress. Hugo Black and William O. Douglas led the opposing faction; they agreed the court should defer to Congress in matters of economic policy, but felt the judicial agenda had been transformed from questions of property rights to those of individual liberties, and in this area, courts <b>should</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> more activist role. Warren's belief that the judiciary must seek to do justice placed him with the activists, although {{he did not have a}} solid majority until after Frankfurter's retirement in 1962.|$|E
25|$|After Dix's health {{forced her}} to {{relinquish}} her school, she began working out as a governess for the family of Dr. W. E. Channing. It was while working with this family that Dix traveled to St. Croix, where she first witnessed slavery {{as one of the}} evils of the world. In 1831, she established a model school for girls in Boston, operating it until 1836, when she had another health breakdown. Dix was encouraged to take a trip to Europe to help aid her health by her physician. When she was there she met the other reformers who inspired her to start working on equal rights for the mentally ill. These reformers were Elizabeth Fry, Samuel Tuke and William Rathbone with whom she lived during the duration of her trip in Europe. In hopes of a cure, in 1836 she traveled to England, where she met the Rathbone family. They invited her as a guest to Greenbank, their ancestral mansion in Liverpool. The Rathbones were Quakers and prominent social reformers. At Greenbank, Dix met their circle {{of men and women who}} believed that government <b>should</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> direct, active role in social welfare. She was also introduced to the reform movement for care of the mentally ill in Great Britain, known as lunacy reform. Its members were making deep investigations of madhouses and asylums, publishing their studies in reports to the House of Commons.|$|E

The tax, {{proposed by the}} Liberal Party in 2002 to tackle a fiscal deficit, was introduced by Donald Tsang {{as part of the}} government's population policy when he was Chief Secretary for Administration.

500|$|Both media {{ownership}} and content are carefully {{regulated by the}} Government. Given how government-linked companies appear to exercise a near monopoly over the mainstream media in Singapore, the view has been taken that the mainstream media take a predominantly pro-PAP stance in their reporting and suppress or disregard the viewpoints of opposition parties. The Government has justified this approach by stressing that the media <b>should</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> constructive role in nation-building by adopting and presenting a national perspective on issues. In other words, the media should support {{the goals of the}} elected leadership and extol consensus instead of contention to enhance national strength and competitiveness, and thus [...] "assiduously eschew advancing its own political agenda" [...] at the expense of straightforward truth.|$|E

David Fincher, the director, {{said that he}} believed that Martin [...] "doesn’t like to kill, he doesn’t like to hear the screams, without hearing his favorite music" [...] so therefore the character <b>should</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> song during the scene. Daniel Craig, the actor who played Blomkvist, selected [...] "Orinoco Flow" [...] on his iPod as a candidate song. Fincher said [...] "And we all almost pissed ourselves, we were laughing so hard. No, actually, it’s worse than that. He said, ‘Orinoco Flow!’ Everybody looked at each other, like, what is he talking about?

500|$|Jackson re-appeared in the {{headlines}} when he and other retired generals, including Major General Tim Cross—who {{was involved in the}} planning effort and later commanded all British troops in Iraq—criticised the American post-war planning for Iraq and attacked the statement by Donald Rumsfeld, US Secretary of Defense, {{at the time of the}} invasion, that the US does not [...] "do nation-building", calling it [...] "nonsensical" [...] and [...] "intellectually bankrupt". Jackson also joined criticism of the British National Party (BNP) in the midst of the 2009 controversy surrounding party leader Nick Griffin's appearance on the panel show Question Time. He accused the BNP of [...] "hijacking" [...] military symbols, saying [...] "the BNP is claiming that it has a better relationship with the Armed Forces than other political parties. How dare they use the image of the Army, in particular, to promote their policies?" [...] He elaborated that it was not a party political issue, but an issue of the armed forces' reputation. Griffin retaliated by calling Jackson and Sir Richard Dannatt [...] "war criminals". A disagreement between Jackson and then Defence Secretary Bob Ainsworth made headlines in 2009, when Ainsworth stated that the UK could only manage a small increase to troop numbers in Afghanistan, saying that the Army had pushed [...] "too hard" [...] when it was engaged in operation in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Jackson countered by saying that the UK <b>should</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> decisive role and that the drawdown of troops from Iraq meant the UK had the capability for a larger increase.|$|E
