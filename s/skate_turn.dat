50|$|Today {{most large}} Dutch cities have indoor skating rinks, {{and the rise}} of speed skating as a sport has enabled many young skaters to learn early how to <b>skate</b> through <b>turns,</b> which was never {{necessary}} on kortebaan tracks. With shorter and shorter periods of frost, fewer and fewer kortebaan sprint tournaments were held, which caused the creation of the indoor sprint alternative now known as KNSB Dutch Super Sprint Championships.|$|R

50|$|Buck {{walked the}} streets of Middletown with a six-shooter {{strapped}} to his side, daring any who insulted his authority to a contest. One day he ran into Captain Good on the main street, and there were harsh words shared between the two men. Later in the day, they met again, {{and this time it}} was a shooting affair, with Buck coming out of the exchange unscathed. The captain was seriously wounded in the arm and legs. In another unrelated incident, Buck shot and killed a man in the Middletown <b>skating</b> rink, <b>turning</b> the arena into a scene of pandemonium.|$|R
60|$|Miss Ward {{handed him}} her <b>skates</b> and <b>turned</b> away. Gertrude placed hers {{on the stool}} and went with Miss Ward. The rest followed, leaving him {{to stare at the}} heap of skates and {{consider}} how he should carry them. He could think of no better plan than to interlace the straps and hang them in a chain over his shoulder. By the time he had done this the young ladies were out of sight, and his intention of enjoying their society during the return to the college was defeated. They had entered the building long before he came in sight of it.|$|R

50|$|The loss of {{new species}} in an {{ecosystem}} will eventually affect all living creatures. In the U.S. and Canada, {{there was a}} dramatic reduction of shark population along the U.S. east coast. Since then, {{there has been an}} increase in population of rays and <b>skates,</b> which in <b>turn</b> has decimated the population of shellfish. The loss of shellfish has reduced the water quality and the size of sea grass beds. Biodiversity is being lost at a fast rate. The more species there are in an ecosystem, the more resilient it is to evolution.|$|R

5000|$|A counter turn {{is a kind}} of one-foot <b>turn</b> {{in figure}} <b>skating.</b> Unlike three <b>turns</b> and brackets, where the entry and exit edges follow the same curve, in a counter the entry and exit are on {{opposite}} curves.

5000|$|... (Meredith) {{was tall}} (five foot eleven), very slim (one hundred and sixty-five pounds), and {{distinguished}} in appearance - his hazel eyes were most expressive, and his jet black hair set off his charming face. His manner was easy and courteous, his voice one to coax the birds off the bough, and his dark blue suit of Broadcloth was in excellent taste and worn with an air.... For all his {{good looks and}} cleverness, Meredith's lonely and uncertain childhood had {{left him with a}} self-doubting diffidence, a certain lack of mettle that would leave him, in the end, somewhat disappointed and unfulfilled. But in the beginning, as a clever young barrister with a natural flair for fun and games, and an Irish talent for making friends, he and Canada got on like a house on fire. Though a late-bloomer on <b>skates,</b> he <b>turned</b> out to be a whizz at hockey, playing on the frozen St. Lawrence... More significantly for his career, he also developed a notable flair for administration and quiet diplomacy.|$|R
50|$|A rocker turn {{is a kind}} of one-foot <b>turn</b> {{in figure}} <b>skating.</b> Unlike three <b>turns</b> and brackets, where the entry and exit edges follow the same curve, in a rocker, the entry and exit are on {{opposite}} curves. When executing a rocker, the skater turns inward on the curve of the entry edge, but exits on a curve in the opposite sense. Another {{way to look at it}} is that a rocker is similar to the entry of a three turn combined with the exit of a bracket. (The opposite combination is called a counter turn.) In a rocker <b>turn,</b> the <b>skating</b> edge is maintained; for example, a rocker from a forward outside edge ends on a backward outside edge.|$|R
5000|$|... 1863: The four-wheeled <b>turning</b> roller <b>skate,</b> or quad skate, {{with four}} wheels set in two {{side-by-side}} pairs (front and rear), was first designed, in New York City by James Leonard Plimpton {{in an attempt}} to improve upon previous designs. The skate contained a pivoting action using a rubber cushion that allowed the skater to skate a curve just by pressing his weight to one side or the other, most commonly by leaning to one side. It was a huge success, {{so much so that the}} first public roller skating rinks were opened in 1866, first in New York City by Plimpton in his furniture store and then in Newport, Rhode Island with the support of Plimpton. The design of the quad <b>skate</b> allowed easier <b>turns</b> and maneuverability, and the quad skate came to dominate the industry for more than a century.|$|R
50|$|Nik Freitas is a singer-songwriter from Visalia, California and {{currently}} residing in Los Angeles. Freitas {{began his career}} as a staff photographer for Thrasher Magazine where he traveled the world taking <b>skate</b> photos until <b>turning</b> his attention to music full-time in 2001. Since then, Freitas has released four records, almost all of which were produced entirely by him (he plays every instrument). Stylistically similar to musicians like The Beatles, Paul Simon and Elliott Smith, his fourth album, Sun Down was released in 2008 by Conor Oberst's Team Love Records, leading to increased publicity. He has also participated with Oberst's back-up band, the Mystic Valley Band, performing two of his own songs on their debut album Outer South. He has been part of the performing band for the Broken Bells on their tour and also tours as a solo act to support his fifth album, Center of the World.|$|R
5000|$|Little skates {{are more}} active {{at night and}} spend {{much of the day}} buried in sediment, usually near {{specific}} landscape features such as depressions excavated by other animals. They employ a curious mode of locomotion, dubbed [...] "punting" [...] by the first scientists to document it, to move over the sea floor. The forward lobes of the pelvic fins are modified into leg-like structures called [...] "crura" [...] (singular [...] "crus"), containing three flexible joints and modified skeletal and muscular elements. The little skate pushes off the substrate with both crura and then glides a short distance on its wings while repositioning the crura for the next push. The crura are also used as pivots when the <b>skate</b> needs to <b>turn.</b> It has been speculated that using the pelvic fins in this manner assists in hunting, by reducing water turbulence that might alert the prey or distort the ray's electroreception.|$|R
500|$|McAdams {{was born}} in London, Ontario, to Sandra Kay (née Gale), a nurse, and Lance Frederick McAdams, a truck driver and {{furniture}} mover, {{and grew up in}} nearby St. Thomas. She is of English, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh descent; McAdams' maternal fifth great-grandfather, James Gray, was a Loyalist ranger during the American Revolution and fled to Canada after the Battles of Saratoga. McAdams is the eldest of three children, with a sister, Kayleen, a celebrity make-up artist, and a brother, Daniel. She grew up in a Protestant household. When she was four years old, she began figure <b>skating,</b> but <b>turned</b> down an opportunity to move to Toronto when she was nine years old for pair skating training. Then skating became merely [...] "a hobby". She competed in skating until the age of eighteen, winning regional awards. She has since said that skating prepared her for physical acting, because it trained her to be [...] "in tune" [...] with her body. McAdams was educated at Myrtle Street Public School, and later Central Elgin Collegiate Institute. She did not enjoy academic work and often would pretend to be sick to avoid going to school. Nonetheless, she was active in student life. In addition to playing sports (including volleyball, badminton, and soccer), McAdams served on the student council, participated in the Crimestoppers program, and {{was a member of the}} Peer Helping Team. She worked at a McDonald's restaurant during the summer holidays for three years.|$|R
