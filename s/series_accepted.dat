40|$|We {{investigate}} joint low-latency {{gravitational wave}} (GW) detection and prompt electromagnetic (EM) follow-up observations of coalescing binary neutron stars (BNSs). Assuming that BNS mergers {{are associated with}} short duration gamma ray bursts (SGRBs), we evaluate if rapid EM follow-ups can capture the prompt emission, early engine activity or reveal any potential by-products such as magnetars or fast radio bursts. To examine the expected performance of extreme low-latency search pipelines, we simulate a population of coalescing BNSs and use these to estimate the detectability and localisation efficiency at different times before merger. Using observational SGRB flux data corrected to {{the range of the}} advanced GW interferometric detectors, we determine what EM observations could be achieved from low-frequency radio up to high energy γ-ray. We show that while challenging, breakthrough multi-messenger science is possible through low latency pipelines.

40|$|The size of {{a planet}} is an {{observable}} property directly connected to the physics of its formation and evolution. We used precise radius measurements from the California-Kepler Survey (CKS) to study the size distribution of 2025 Kepler planets in fine detail. We detect a factor of ≥ 2 deficit in the occurrence rate distribution at 1. 5 - 2. 0 R_⊕. This gap splits the population of close-in (P < 100 d) small planets into two size regimes: R_P < 1. 5 R_⊕ and R_P = 2. 0 - 3. 0 R_⊕, with few planets in between. Planets in these two regimes have nearly the same intrinsic frequency based on occurrence measurements that account for planet detection efficiencies. The paucity of planets between 1. 5 and 2. 0 R_⊕ supports the emerging picture that close-in planets smaller than Neptune are composed of rocky cores measuring 1. 5 R_⊕ or smaller with varying amounts of low-density gas that determine their total sizes.

40|$|The {{observed}} {{magnetic field}} on the solar surface {{is characterized by a}} very complex spatial and temporal behavior. Although feature-tracking algorithms have allowed us to deepen our understanding of this behavior, subjectivity {{plays an important role in}} the identification and tracking of such features. In this paper, we continue studies Gorobets, A. Y., Borrero, J. M., & Berdyugina, S. 2016, ApJL, 825, L 18 of the temporal stochasticity of the magnetic {{field on the}} solar surface without relying either on the concept of magnetic features or on subjective assumptions about their identification and interaction. We propose a data analysis method to quantify fluctuations of the line-of-sight magnetic field by means of reducing the temporal field's evolution to the regular Markov process. We build a representative model of fluctuations converging to the unique stationary (equilibrium) distribution in the long time limit with maximum entropy. We obtained different rates of convergence to the equilibrium at fixed noise cutoff for two sets of data. This indicates a strong influence of the data spatial resolution and mixing-polarity fluctuations on the relaxation process. The analysis is applied to observations of magnetic fields of the relatively quiet areas around an active region carried out during the second flight of the Sunrise/IMaX and quiet Sun areas at the disk center from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory satellite.

40|$|In this work, we {{identify}} 63 bona fide new candidates to T Tauri stars (TTSs) in the Taurus-Auriga region using as baseline its ultraviolet excess. The initial data set {{has been defined}} from the GALEX all sky survey (AIS). The GALEX satellite obtained images in the near ultraviolet (NUV) and far ultraviolet (FUV) bands where the TTSs show a prominent excess, compared with main sequence or giants stars. GALEX AIS surveyed the Taurus-Auriga molecular complex, as well as, {{a fraction of the}} California Nebula and the Perseus complex; bright sources and the dark clouds themselves are avoided. The properties of the TTSs in the ultraviolet (GALEX), optical (UCAC 4) and infrared (2 MASS) have been defined using as qualification sample the TTSs observed with the International Ultraviolet Explorer. The candidates have been identified by means of a mixed ultraviolet-optical-infrared excess set of colors; it is found that the color-color diagram FUV-NUV versus J-K is ideally suited for this purpose. From an initial sample of 163, 313 bona-fide NUV sources, a final list with 63 new candidates to TTSs in the region has been produced. The search procedure has been validated by its ability to detect all known TTSs in the area surveyed: 31 TTSs. Also, it is shown that the weak-lined TTSs are located in a well defined stripe in the FUV-NUV versus J-K diagram. Moreover, we provide in this work a list of TTSs photometric standards for future GALEX-based studies of the young stellar population in star forming regions.

40|$|The {{development}} of advanced gravitational wave (GW) observatories, such as Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo, provides impetus to refine theoretical predictions for what these instruments might detect. In particular, with the range increasing by {{an order of}} magnitude, the search for GW sources is extending beyond the "local" Universe and out to cosmological distances. Double compact objects (neutron star-neutron star (NS-NS), black hole-neutron star (BH-NS) and black hole-black hole (BH-BH) systems) {{are considered to be}} the most promising gravitational wave sources. In addition, NS-NS and/or BH-NS systems are thought to be the progenitors of gamma ray bursts (GRBs), and may also be associated with kilonovae. In this paper we present the merger event rates of these objects as a function of cosmological redshift. We provide the results for four cases, each one investigating a different important evolution parameter of binary stars. Each case is also presented for two metallicity evolution scenarios. We find that (i) in most cases NS-NS systems dominate the merger rates in the local Universe, while BH-BH mergers dominate at high redshift; (ii) BH-NS mergers are less frequent than other sources per unit volume, for all time; and (iii) natal kicks may alter the observable properties of populations in a significant way, allowing the underlying models of binary evolution and compact object formation to be easily distinguished. This is the second paper in a series of three. The third paper will focus on calculating the detection rates of mergers by gravitational wave telescopes.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a scheme to}} extract linearly supporting (LSU) features from stellar spectra to automatically estimate the atmospheric parameters $T_{eff}$, log$~g$, and [Fe/H]. "Linearly supporting" means that the atmospheric parameters can be accurately estimated from the extracted features through a linear model. The successive steps of the process are as follow: first, decompose the spectrum using a wavelet packet (WP) and represent it by the derived decomposition coefficients; second, detect representative spectral features from the decomposition coefficients using the proposed method Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LARS) $_{bs}$; third, estimate the atmospheric parameters $T_{eff}$, log$~g$, and [Fe/H] from the detected features using a linear regression method. One prominent characteristic of this scheme {{is its ability to}} evaluate quantitatively the contribution of each detected feature to the atmospheric parameter estimate and also to trace back the physical significance of that feature. This work also shows that the usefulness of a component depends on both wavelength and frequency. The proposed scheme has been evaluated on both real spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) /SEGUE and synthetic spectra calculated from Kurucz's NEWODF models. On real spectra, we extracted 23 features to estimate $T_{eff}$, 62 features for log$~g$, and 68 features for [Fe/H]. Test consistencies between our estimates and those provided by the Spectroscopic Sarameter Pipeline of SDSS show that the mean absolute errors (MAEs) are 0. 0062 dex for log$~T_{eff}$ (83 K for $T_{eff}$), 0. 2345 dex for log$~g$, and 0. 1564 dex for [Fe/H]. For the synthetic spectra, the MAE test accuracies are 0. 0022 dex for log$~T_{eff}$ (32 K for $T_{eff}$), 0. 0337 dex for log$~g$, and 0. 0268 dex for [Fe/H].
