5|$|The {{panel is}} the {{smallest}} extant work by van der Weyden and follows the tradition of a Madonna Lactans, with significant differences. Christ {{is dressed in a}} red garment, as opposed to the <b>swaddling</b> he usually wears in 15th-century Virgin and Child portrayals. This is one of two exceptions where he is fully clothed; the other is Robert Campin's Madonna in Frankfurt, where he is shown in blue clothing. Mary's unbound blond hair falls across her shoulders and down across her arms. Showing the influence of Campin, it is brushed behind the ears. She wears a crown as Queen of Heaven and a ring on a finger as the Bride of Christ. Reinforcing this, the blue colour of her robe alludes to her devotion and fidelity to her son. The folds of her dress are reminiscent of the lengthy, crisp, curved intertwined gowns of Gothic sculpture.|$|E
5|$|Spencer {{seeks out}} the Beautiful Girl Across the Hall, but finds her with another man. Crushed, Spencer {{returns to his}} room, where the child is crying. He takes a pair of {{scissors}} {{and for the first time}} removes the child's <b>swaddling.</b> It is revealed that the child has no skin; the bandages held its internal organs together, and they spill apart after the rags are cut. The child gasps in pain, and Spencer cuts its organs with the scissors. The wounds gush a thick liquid, covering the child. The power in the room overloads; as the lights flicker on and off the child grows to huge proportions. When the lights burn out completely, the child's head is replaced by the planet. Spencer appears amidst a billowing cloud of eraser shavings. The side of the planet bursts apart, and inside, the Man in the Planet struggles with his levers, which are now emitting sparks. Spencer is embraced warmly by the Lady in the Radiator, as both white light and white noise crescendo.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{measures}} {{have been found to}} be effective in preventing SIDS including changing the sleeping position, breastfeeding, limiting soft bedding, immunizing the infant and using pacifiers. The use of electronic monitors has not been found to be useful as a preventative strategy. The effect that fans might have on the risk of SIDS has not been studied well enough to make any recommendation about them. Evidence regarding <b>swaddling</b> is unclear regarding SIDS. A 2016 review found tentative evidence that <b>swaddling</b> increases risk of SIDS, especially among babies placed on their stomachs or side while sleeping.|$|E

25|$|Hip {{dysplasia}} {{may occur}} at birth or develop in early life. Risk factors include family history, certain <b>swaddling</b> practices, and breech birth. If one identical twin is affected, {{there is a}} 40% risk the other will also be affected. Screening all babies for the condition by physical examination is recommended. Ultrasonography may also be useful.|$|E

25|$|The {{cause of}} this {{condition}} is unknown; however, some factors of congenital hip dislocation are through heredity and racial background. It is also thought that the higher rates in some ethnic groups (such as some Native American groups) {{is due to the}} practice <b>swaddling</b> of infants, which is known to be a potential risk factor for developing dysplasia. It also has a low risk in African Americans and southern Chinese.|$|E
25|$|It {{takes its}} name {{either from the}} {{lightness}} of the material {{of which it is}} made, or from the fact that during the Nicene Creed in the Divine Liturgy, the priest holds it high in the air and waves it slowly over the Chalice and Diskos. Its original use was to cover the Chalice and prevent anything from falling into it before the consecration. It symbolizes the <b>swaddling</b> clothes with which Christ was wrapped at his Nativity, and also the grave clothes in which he was wrapped at his burial (both themes are found in the text of the Liturgy of Preparation).|$|E
25|$|Saturn Devouring His Son, a {{disturbing}} {{portrait of the}} titan Saturn consuming one of his children, was one of six works with which Goya decorated the dining room. According to Roman myth (inspired by the original Greek myth), it had been foretold {{that one of the}} sons of Saturn would overthrow him, just as he had overthrown his father, Caelus. To prevent this, Saturn ate his children moments after each was born. His wife Ops eventually hid his third son, Jupiter, on the island of Crete, deceiving Saturn by offering a stone wrapped in <b>swaddling</b> in his place. Jupiter eventually supplanted his father just as the prophecy had predicted.|$|E

500|$|Between the {{publication}} of The Pothunters 1902 and that of Mike in 1909, Wodehouse wrote eight novels and co-wrote another two. The critic R.D.B. French writes that, of Wodehouse's work from this period, almost all that deserves to survive is the school fiction. Looking back in the 1950s Wodehouse viewed these as his apprentice years: [...] "I was practically in <b>swaddling</b> clothes and it is extremely creditable to me that I was able to write at all." ...|$|E
500|$|The next year, in 1885, Naval Academy {{officials}} finally {{approved of}} the playing of football. According to Morris Allison Bealle, [...] "Football at Annapolis had shed its <b>swaddling</b> clothes when the autumn of 1885 rolled around. Some of the faculty actually gave in and admitted that football might, at that, be or become an interesting diversion". After Navy won their opener and Hopkins split their record at 1–1, the two teams met again at the Naval Academy Thanksgiving Day athletic carnival. Johns Hopkins managed a 12–8 victory over the Academy, tying the series at two wins apiece.|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} her life, Wollstonecraft {{had been}} {{involved}} in almost every arena of education: she had been a governess, a teacher, a children's writer, and a pedagogical theorist. Most of her works deal with education in some way. For example, her two novels are bildungsromane (novels of education); she translated educational works such as Christian Gotthilf Salzmann's Elements of Morality; she wrote a children's book, Original Stories from Real Life (1788); and her Vindication of the Rights of Woman is largely an argument for the value of female education. As is evidenced by this broad range of genres, [...] "education" [...] for Wollstonecraft and her contemporaries included much more than scholastic training; it encompassed everything that went into forming a person's character, from infant <b>swaddling</b> to childhood curricular choices to adolescent leisure activities.|$|E

500|$|The Naval Academy {{scheduled}} {{three games}} for the 1885 season, breaking from the tradition of playing only Johns Hopkins. According to Morris Allison Bealle, [...] "Football at Annapolis had shed its <b>swaddling</b> clothes when the autumn of 1885 rolled around. Some of the faculty actually gave in and admitted that football might, at that, be or become an interesting diversion" [...] so the squad was allowed to schedule three games. The first was played against St. John's College, also located in Annapolis. The game kicked off a brief rivalry with St. John's, which would conclude in 1911 with Navy winning eighteen of twenty-one contests. The 1885 match was a 46–10 blowout victory over St. John's. The second {{game of the season}} was the annual Thanksgiving Day match against Johns Hopkins. After winning the previous year, Navy fell to Johns Hopkins 12–8. The season concluded with the Naval Academy challenging the Princeton freshman team, a game which ended in a 10–0 shutout loss for Navy.|$|E
2500|$|As an {{acquired}} condition {{it has often}} been linked to traditions of <b>swaddling</b> infants, use of overly restrictive baby seats, carriers and other methods of transporting babies, or use of a cradle board which locks the hip joint in an [...] "adducted" [...] position (pulling the knees together tends to pull the heads of the femur bone out of the sockets or acetabulae) for extended periods. Modern <b>swaddling</b> techniques, such as the 'hip healthy swaddle' have been developed to relieve stress on hip joints caused by traditional <b>swaddling</b> methods.|$|E

2500|$|In Luke's Gospel, Joseph and Mary {{travelled}} to Bethlehem, {{the family}} of Joseph's ancestors, to be listed in a tax census; the Journey to Bethlehem is a very rare subject in the West, but shown in some large Byzantine cycles.

50|$|Modern {{specialized}} baby <b>swaddles</b> {{are designed}} {{to make it easier}} to <b>swaddle</b> a baby than with traditional square blanket. They are typically fabric blankets in a triangle, 'T' or 'Y' shape, with 'wings' that fold around the baby's torso or down over the baby's shoulders and around underneath the infant. Some of these products employ Velcro patches or other fasteners. Some parents prefer a specialized device because of the relative ease of use, and many parents prefer a large square receiving blanket or wrap because they can get a tighter and custom fit and the baby will not outgrow the blanket.|$|R
