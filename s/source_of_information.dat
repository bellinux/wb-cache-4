5|$|Inscriptions in Sanskrit and Kannada are {{the main}} <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> about Badami Chalukya history.

The Badami cliff inscription of PulakeshinI (543), the Mahakuta Pillar inscription of Mangalesha (595) and the Aihole inscription of PulakeshinII (634) are examples of important Sanskrit inscriptions written in old Kannada script.|$|E

Vesta is the last remaining rocky protoplanet (with a differentiated interior) {{of the kind that}} formed the terrestrial planets. Numerous fragments of Vesta were ejected by collisions one and two billion years ago that left two enormous craters occupying much of Vesta's southern hemisphere. Debris from these events has fallen to Earth as howardite–eucrite–diogenite (HED) meteorites, which have been a rich <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> about Vesta.|$|E

5|$|Many of the regnal {{dates of}} the East Anglian kings are {{considered}} unreliable, often being based upon computations.

The main <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> about the early history of the kingdom's rulers is Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People.|$|E

5|$|Rituals {{in honor}} of Osiris are another major <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>information.</b> Some of these texts are found {{on the walls of}} temples that date from the New Kingdom, the Ptolemaic era (323–30 BCE), or the Roman era (30 BCE to the fourth century AD). Some of these late ritual texts, in which Isis and Nephthys lament their brother's death, were adapted into funerary texts. In these texts, the goddesses' pleas were meant to rouse Osiris—and thus the {{deceased}} person—to live again.|$|E

5|$|St-Calais was a Norman, and {{a native}} of Bayeux; {{he may have been}} a member of one of its {{clerical}} dynasties. His mother's name, Ascelina or Anselma, is given in Durham's records; his father, whose name is unknown, became a monk at the monastery of Saint-Calais in Maine, and may previously have been a knight. Although St-Calais is generally referred to as Saint Calais or St-Calais, the main <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> about his life, the monastic chronicle of Symeon of Durham, does not call him such.|$|E
5|$|The less-prominent women {{mentioned}} in the play are subordinated as well, as they are only described through {{the men of the}} play. Most of what is said about Sycorax, for example, is said by Prospero. Further, Stephen Orgel notes that Prospero has never met Sycorax – all he learned about her he learned from Ariel. According to Orgel, Prospero's suspicion of women makes him an unreliable <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>information.</b> Orgel suggests that he is sceptical of female virtue in general, citing his ambiguous remark about his wife's fidelity.|$|E
5|$|Then {{there is}} the {{deliberate}} citation of false information which is then ascribed legitimate authors.

In addition Quintus Gargilius Martialis, who produced works on horticulture and medicine, is cited twice as a biographer, which is considered to be another false attribution.|$|E
