50|$|If {{the other}} {{renewable}} alternatives are too warm {{during the summer}} or too expensive, cold storage can be investigated. In large scale applications underground and snow storage {{are the most likely}} alternatives. In an underground storage the winter cold is heat exchanged from the air and loaded into the bedrock or an aquifer by one or more bore holes. In a snow storage frozen water (snow and/or ice) is saved in some kind of <b>storage</b> (<b>pile,</b> pit, cavern etc.). The cold is utilized by pumping melt water to the cooling object, directly in a district cooling system or indirect by a heat exchanger. The lukewarm melt water is then pumped back to the snow where it gets cooled and mixed with new melt water. Snow cooling works as a single cold source but can also be used for peak cooling since there is no relevant cooling limit. In Sweden there is one snow cooling plant in Sundsvall, built and owned by the county. The cooling load in Sundsvall is about 2000 kW (570 tons of refrigeration) and 1500 MWh/year.|$|E

40|$|The Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Environmental Technology Section {{conducted}} an independent verification (IV) {{survey of the}} clean <b>storage</b> <b>pile</b> at the Johnston Atoll Plutonium Contaminated Soil Remediation Project (JAPCSRP) from January 18 - 25, 1999. The goal of the JAPCSRP is to restore a 24 -acre area that was contaminated with plutonium oxide particles during nuclear testing in the 1960 s. The selected remedy was a soil sorting operation that combined radiological measurements and mining processes to identify and sequester plutonium-contaminated soil. The soil sorter operated from about 1990 to 1998. The remaining clean soil is stored on-site for planned beneficial use on Johnston Island. The clean <b>storage</b> <b>pile</b> currently consists of approximately 120, 000 m{sup 3 } of coral. ORNL conducted the survey according to a Sampling and Analysis Plan, which proposed to provide an IV of the clean pile by collecting a minimum number (99) of samples. The goal was to ascertain with 95 % confidence whether 97 % of the processed soil is {{less than or equal}} to the accepted guideline (500 -Bq/kg or 13. 5 -pCi/g) total transuranic (TRU) activity. In previous IV tasks, ORNL has (1) evaluated and tested the soil sorter system software and hardware and (2) evaluated the quality control (QC) program used at the soil sorter plant. The IV has found that the soil sorter decontamination was effective and significantly reduced plutonium contamination in the soil processed at the JA site. The Field Command Defense Threat Reduction Agency currently plans to re-use soil from the clean pile as a cover to remaining contamination in portions of the radiological control area. Therefore, ORNL was requested to provide an IV. The survey team collected samples from 103 random locations within the top 4 ft of the clean <b>storage</b> <b>pile.</b> The samples were analyzed in the on-site radioanalytical counting laboratory with an American Nuclear Systems (ANS) field instrument used for the detection of low-energy radiation. Nine results exceeded the JA soil screening guideline for distributed contamination of 13. 5 pCi/g for total TRUs, ranging from 13. 7 to 125. 9 pCi/g. Because of these results, the goal of showing with 95 % confidence that 97 % of the processed soil is {{less than or equal to}} 13. 5 pCi/g-TRU activity cannot be met. The value of 13. 5 pCi/g represents the 88 th percentile rather than the 95 th percentile in a nonparametric one-sided upper 90 % confidence limit. Therefore, at the 95 % confidence level, 88 % of the clean pile is projected to be below the 13. 5 -pCi/g goal. The Multi-Agency Radiation Survey and Site Investigation Manual recommends use of a nonparametric statistical ''Sign Test'' to demonstrate compliance with release criteria for TRU. Although this survey was not designed to use the sign test, the data herein would demonstrate that the median (50 %) of the clean <b>storage</b> <b>pile</b> is below the l 3. 5 -pCi/g derived concentration guideline level. In other words, with the caveat that additional investigation of elevated concentrations was not performed, the data pass the sign test at the 13. 5 -pCi/g level. Additionally, the lateral extent of the pile was gridded, and 10 % of the grid blocks was scanned with field instruments for the detection of low-energy radiation coupled to ratemeter/scalers to screen for the presence of hot particles. No hot particles were detected in the top 1 cm of the grid blocks surveyed...|$|E

This stockpile was created for dry FGD by-product material {{to be held in}} reserve for a land application uses field demonstration. High volume, beneficial uses of dry FGD by-products, such as for mine reclamation and embankment stabilization, will require temporary stockpiling of the by-product. Purpose for constructing this pile was to study changes with time in the LIMB by-product material when exposed to weathering. This by-product material was studied over a 2 1 / 2 year period. The water to control fugitive dust was added in the ash conditioner at the power plant while being loaded into dump trucks.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect of tree stump extraction on the diversity of saproxylic insects in Norway spruce Picea abies roots. I tested if the density of saproxylic beetles was {{the same in the}} interior layer of the stump <b>storage</b> <b>piles</b> as in the exterior layer. I also tested if the beetle density was as high or higher in piles as in remaining stumps at extraction clear-cuts and to test if they could be ecological traps. I tested if species at higher trophic level as well as red-listed species could be impacted negatively by stump extraction. A total of 110 root wood samples were collected from 6 clear-cuts and 6 extraction clear-cuts and 4 different piles in central Sweden near Uppsala, Lindesberg and Fågelfors. The clear-cuts were dominated by Norway spruce and were sampled 1 to 2 years after clear felling. Norway spruce is the most common tree species used in tree stump extraction. Insect were reared from the sampled roots in rearing boxes for 8 weeks. Insects were also sampled after the rearing box period by pealing the bark of the roots and putting the bark in Tullgren-funnels to sample the last insects inside the bark. The sampled Coleoptera were determined to species level. A total of 1379 beetles of 35 species were collected from the roots. Higher species richness was found inside the piles (PIN) than {{on the outside of the}} piles (POUT). Hardly any difference was found between the clear-cut (C) and extraction clear-cut (EC) in species-richness per root-sample, but a significant difference was found between the pile habitats. Common saproxylic species, like Dryocetes autographus and Hylastes cunicularius, showed increased abundance in C and EC but a decrease in the <b>storage</b> <b>piles.</b> The pest species Pityogenes chalcographus was only reared in PIN. Predatory species higher up in the trophic levels, like the staphylinid Nudobius lentus, were found in low abundance in C, EC and in POUT but not in PIN. This could mean that the piles can be an ecological trap to species at higher trophic levels as well as for some pest species. The results of this study indicates that tree stump extraction can cause a lower diversity of saproxylic insects in Norway spruce roots and a decreased species richness if the stump piles constitutes an ecological trap. As a consequence, this can decrease the diversity and species richness in the surrounding area...|$|R

40|$|Modeling the {{transport}} of contaminant metals and designing systems for their remediation requires {{an understanding of the}} metal`s speciation. Thus, analysis of contaminant speciation and evaluation of the processes that can change the speciation should be done during characterization of the contaminated site. This approach is being used at the Savannah River Site for a metals contaminated site that will serve as a test platform for metals remediation technologies. The site is adjacent to a coal <b>storage</b> <b>pile</b> and the basin that contains the coal pile runoff. A network of well clusters allows definition of the plume, including profiles of contamination with depth. The groundwater is acidic (pH {approx} 2) and contains high concentrations of sulfate (up to 2300 mg/l) and metals, with chromium, nickel, cadmium and lead exceeding drinking water standards. Aluminum and total iron concentrations range up to 1326 mg/l and 7991 mg/l, respectively. Speciation calculations on dissolved contaminants indicate that as much as 65 % of the lead, 54 % of the cadmium, and 34 % of the nickel may be present in sulfate complexes. Chromium occurs predominantly as Cr{sup + 3 }. There is evidence that some contaminant metals may be associated with colloidal material. Contamination in the groundwater is stratified with concentrations decreasing over a depth range of 3 meters (10 feet).

40|$|The flux of {{fugitive}} {{dust from}} {{sources such as}} <b>storage</b> <b>piles,</b> construction activities, or unpaved roads is generally measured by setting up towers with wind speed and dust concentration instruments at discrete heights. (Cowherd, Maxwell et al., 1977; EPA, 1998 c) Converting these discrete measurements into an integrated total flux is problematic because {{it is necessary to}} make assumptions about the conditions above the highest measurement, interpolated between the measurements, and below the lowest measurement. Frequently an arbitrary “step ” approach has been used. The authors suggest that a much better approach is to first approximate the wind speed versus height data and the dust concentration versus height data by physically plausible functions. Then the dust flux can be calculated by integrating the product of the two functions. The preferred formulation is the combination of a power law profile for wind speed versused height and an exponential profile for dust concentration versus height. This results in an equation with an analytical solution. The following derivation has been published in a more complete form in: Veranth, J. M., G. Seshadri, and E.
