25|$|The 204 used a {{front-wheel drive}} layout and was {{launched}} on 20 April 1965 with a <b>single</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> 1130 cc petrol engine (the maximum {{allowed for the}} 6CV 'car tax' class in France). In September 1975, {{less than a year}} before production ceased, it received a more modern petrol engine, now of 1127 cc. Claimed maximum output, which at launch had been 53bhp (39kW), increased to 59bhp (43kW), though there was a marginal reduction in maximum torque.|$|E
25|$|The Halberstadt D.III {{primarily}} {{differed from}} the D.II version in its substitution of the Argus As.II 90kW (120hp) straight-six engine, which {{differed from the}} usual Mercedes D.II powerplant in having its camshaft in the engine block and using pushrods to operate the overhead valves, rather than having a camshaft running atop all of the cylinders as in a <b>single</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> engine. A total of 50 D.III examples were built by Halberstadt, with the first 30 ordered in July 1916 and the last 20 ordered in August 1916.|$|E
2500|$|... 750 cc and 500 cc {{versions}} of the Revolution engine are used in Harley-Davidson's Street line of light cruisers. These motors, named the Revolution X, use a <b>single</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>cam,</b> screw and locknut valve adjustment, a single internal counterbalancer, and vertically split crankcases; all of these changes making it different from the original Revolution design.|$|E

5000|$|The Honda CL100 was a {{four stroke}} <b>single</b> {{cylinder}} <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> motorcycle made by Honda, {{and sold in}} the US from 1970 to 1973. The CL designation indicated this model to be the [...] "Scrambler" [...] or dual sport version.|$|R
50|$|The first model, the V92C, was debuted at Planet Hollywood in the Mall of America by Al Unser, Jr. in 1997. Production began {{starting}} on July 4, 1998 for the 1999 model {{that was the}} first official model year. At , the V92C was the second largest production motorcycle engine available at the time, and sparked a race among motorcycle manufacturers to build bigger and bigger engines. All components for the V92C were manufactured in Minnesota and Iowa, except the Italian Brembo brakes and the British-made electronic fuel injection system. Victory engines debuted with five-speed transmissions (later six), <b>single</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>cams,</b> dual connecting rods, hydraulic lifters, and fuel injection; most fuel-injection components are standard GM parts. The V92C engine was designed to be easily tuned by the owner.|$|R
2500|$|The Alfa Romeo 6C {{name was}} used on road, race, and sports cars {{produced}} between 1927 and 1954 by Alfa Romeo; the [...] "6C" [...] name refers to six cylinders of the car's straight-six engine. Bodies for these cars {{were made by}} coachbuilders such as James Young, Zagato, Touring, Castagna, and Pininfarina. Starting from 1933 {{there was also a}} 6C version with a factory Alfa body, built in Portello. In the early 1920s Vittorio Jano got a task to create a lightweight, high performance vehicle to replace the Giuseppe Merosi designed RL and RM models. The car was introduced in April 1925 at the Salone dell’ Automobile di Milano as the 6C 1500. It was based on the P2 racing car, using <b>single</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> 1,487 cc inline six-cylinder motor producing 44 horsepower, in the 1928 was presented the 1500 Sport which was the first Alfa Romeo road car with double overhead camshafts.|$|E
50|$|All the EJ series share {{compatibility}} {{and construction}} similarity and are 16 valved engines. The EJ series {{started with the}} EJ15, a 1.5-litre (SOHC) and makes ~90 hp, then the EJ16, a 1.6-litre <b>single</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> (SOHC). Later followed by the EJ20, a 120 hp 2.0-litre <b>single</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> and the EJ22, a 135 hp 2.2-litre <b>single</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>cam.</b> The EJ20 turbocharged version was developed with dual overhead cams, as well as non-turbo DOHC engines and DOHC twin-turbos. The EJ18 and EJ20 were most popular in Europe.|$|E

5000|$|The Suzuki DR350 is a 350cc single cylinder, dual-sport {{motorcycle}} {{introduced in}} 1990 and produced until 2001.The DR350 S and DR350 R were kick start motorcycles until 1994 when the DR350SE was introduced adding an electric start. It has a [...] <b>single</b> cylinder <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> (OHC), with the Suzuki Advanced Cooling System (SACS), dry sump lubrication, 6-speed transmission, 21-inch front wheel and 18-inch rear wheel.|$|R
50|$|The engine {{initially}} displaced 379 cuin L, {{though the}} potential for larger displacements was engineered into the design. It had SOHCs actuating the valves via roller-tipped rockers mounted on rockershafts flanking the centrally located camshaft. Just like the FE Cammer, this allows splayed valves. It has a bore spacing of 4.53 inches, a stroke of 3.74 inches, a bore of 4.015 inches, and a deep-skirted thinwall casting block with cross-bolted mains. The 1950s-designed 390 FE had a bore spacing of 4.63 inches, a stroke of 3.78 inches, a bore of 4.05 inches, and a deep-skirted thinwall casting block. The SOHC version of the FE with cross-bolted maincaps, developed in 1965, had <b>single</b> <b>overhead</b> <b>cams</b> actuating the valves via roller-tipped rockers. A 427 cuin L version of the new Boss engine was put together and tested. It produced 700 hp.|$|R
50|$|Kaiser, {{working with}} a Continental-designed engine, {{introduced}} USA's first mass produced OHC inline six-cylinder engine. It debuted in Kaiser-owned Jeep Corporation vehicles in the mid-1960s. However, Stutz built both <b>single</b> and dual <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> inline six-cylinder engines in, respectively, the late 1920s and early 1930s (sohc) and the early 1930s (dohc). Moreover, these were fitted in Stutz production cars (though their numbers were comparatively small).|$|R

50|$|The Evolution Big Twin motor was, {{until the}} {{introduction}} of the Twin Cam engine, the last of the line of <b>single</b> <b>cam,</b> <b>overhead</b> valve motors tracing their lineage back to the seminal Knucklehead design penned by founder Bill Harley. It is also the largest aftermarket supported Harley-Davidson design, to date, with clones of the engine being produced by third parties like S&S Cycle and several others. Harley reverted to a single cam design with the Milwaukee-Eight engine, first introduced for touring models in 2016.|$|R
25|$|While today some engines rely on {{a single}} {{camshaft}} per cylinder bank, which {{is known as a}} <b>single</b> <b>overhead</b> camshaft (SOHC), most modern engines are driven by a two camshafts per cylinder bank arrangement (one camshaft for the intake valves and another for the exhaust valves); such camshaft arrangement is known as a double or dual <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> (DOHC), thus, a V engine, which has two separate cylinder banks, may have four camshafts (colloquially known as a quad-cam engine).|$|R

50|$|The SX line {{incorporates}} many of {{the same}} technology features as other Subaru industrial engines; most notable is <b>Overhead</b> <b>Cam</b> (OHC) technology. <b>Overhead</b> <b>Cam</b> technology has been proven to enhance engine performance. The technology allows the intake and exhaust valves being positioned for optimum engine performance, which offers lower resistance for the air/fuel mixture flow. <b>Overhead</b> <b>Cam</b> engines also have fewer moving parts and produce less mechanical noise than competitive technologies.|$|R
50|$|This line is Subaru’s {{first to}} utilize {{chain-driven}} <b>overhead</b> <b>cam</b> (OHC) technology, {{and the first}} to utilize OHC technology in the industrial air-cooled small engine market. The significance of <b>Overhead</b> <b>Cam</b> technology is that it’s been proven to enhance engine performance. The technology allows the intake and exhaust valves being positioned for optimum engine performance, which offers lower resistance for the air/fuel mixture flow. <b>Overhead</b> <b>Cam</b> engines also have fewer moving parts and produce less mechanical noise than competitive technologies.

5000|$|This [...] {{engine was}} {{a version of}} the 3.3 but with a larger bore of 96 mm and the {{important}} addition of <b>overhead</b> <b>cams.</b> The 3.5L version has an intake arrangement with two separate manifolds and throttle bodies connected with a crossover valve. This provides better low and midrange torque. The four valves per cylinder are driven by a <b>single</b> <b>overhead</b> camshaft as opposed to the conventional DOHC arrangement for multivalve engines. Another difference with the 3.5 as opposed to the 3.3 is that it has a timing belt, not a timing chain. The water pump is also driven by the timing belt on the 3.5, whereas on the 3.3, the accessory belt drives it.|$|R
