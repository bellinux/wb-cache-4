40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Billions of tons {{of mineral}} wastes are {{generated}} annually by the Australian open-cut coal-mining industry. These wastes include the waste rock which is excavated in order to access the underlying coal seams, and the impurities which are removed when processing the unrefined raw coal. These processing wastes include a gravel-dominated coarse reject stream and a slurry-like tailings reject stream. Typically, the rock waste is disposed of in massive fill structures commonly termed waste dumps or spoil piles, which may be hundreds of meters in height. Coarse rejects from coal processing are trucked to and disposed of in the spoil piles, whilst the fine tailings rejects are traditionally pumped to and disposed of as an aqueous slurry in large tailings dams. These tailings dams are {{a major source of}} safety, environmental and financial risk for mine operators and as such, are subject to increasing financial, social and legislative pressures, coinciding with a decrease in the availability of land on which they can be constructed. An emerging waste disposal strategy in the Australian coal mining industry is spoil-pile codisposal. This entails partly dewatering the tailings rejects, mixing them with the coarse rejects, then disposing of the mixed rejects (herein termed mixed plant rejects or MPR) with the waste rock in the <b>spoil</b> <b>pile.</b> Spoil-pile co-disposal eliminates the requirements to establish and operate a tailings dam and therefore eliminates the associated risks. However, the introduction of potentially low-strength MPR mixtures with relatively high moisture contents poses an increased likelihood of <b>spoil</b> <b>pile</b> slope instability. To date, implementation of spoil-pile co-disposal in the Australian coal mining industry has been largely empirical and based on a “trial and error” approach for waste dump design. Engineering based stability assessments are seldom performed as, at present, the fundamental behaviour or MPR within a <b>spoil</b> <b>pile</b> is not well understood. This is largely attributable to a limited understanding of how various hydrogeological processes facilitate excess pore pressure and varying degrees of saturation during <b>spoil</b> <b>pile</b> construction...|$|E

40|$|Coal mining {{produces}} {{large quantities}} of waste rock (spoil) of generally sedimentary origin. Current practice involves stacking this <b>spoil</b> in <b>piles</b> up to 150 m high. Plans for future mining are considering <b>spoil</b> <b>piles</b> up to 400 m high. Under the corresponding burial stresses, the spoil materials undergo substantial compressions, leading to decreases in void ratio and increases in their degree of saturation (S r) at constant water content. In this study, a typical spoil derived from Permian-aged sandstones and mudrocks, is subjected to stresses up to 20 MPa, with the corresponding changes in degree of saturation and suction measured. The results show that loose spoil with a water content of around 12 % (S r = 25 %) will collapse to become saturated under a stress of 7 MPa. In contrast, loose spoil with a higher water content of around 16 % will collapse to become saturated under a stress of only 1. 5 MPa. From these results, a phenomenon is identified whereby spoil in the seepage and capillary zones {{at the base of}} very high <b>spoil</b> <b>piles</b> can collapse to a state of saturation.

40|$|A preparative {{method was}} {{developed}} to sample dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and heavy metals (Ni, Mn) from polluted surface waters. Main focus was set on the preparative production of freeze-dried samples mainly composed of organic ligands from heavy metal complexes. First characterizations were done in the aqueous phase. Finally, freeze-dried samples provide stable organic matter for multiple characterizations. Acid mine drainage of the former mining area of Ronneburg (Germany) hold elevated concentrations of heavy metals and low concentrations of DOC. Municipal wastewater, passing the <b>spoil</b> <b>pile,</b> held elevated concentrations of DOC and low concentrations of heavy metals. Dissolved components smaller than 0. 45 mu m and larger than 1 nm were concentrated by nanofiltration. Organic heavy metal complexes were isolated from this solution by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). Different size classes of molecules were collected from the column effluent, depending on their elution time, and were characterized by UV spectroscopy, ICP-OES, and DOC measurements. All samples held organic heavy metal compounds with different retention times. The organic heavy metal complexes in acid mine drainage had higher retention times than complexes from municipal wastewater. Most interestingly, we found different affinities of heavy metals to different size classes of DOC. This affinity of the heavy metals differs with size and origin of the DOC. [References: 47...|$|E
40|$|In both {{laboratory}} and field studies, steel slags {{were found to}} generate exceptionally high levels of alkalinity over extended periods. Steel slags also have high neutralization potentials {{and can be used}} as alkaline amendments to acid-producing materials. This paper discusses the alkalinity-generating capacity of steel slags, their metal leaching potential and applications for acid mine drainage control. Results indicate that steel slags can provide highly concentrated alkaline recharge to acid mine wastes. Proper design and sizing offers the potential for a low- to zero-maintenance method for treating acid mine drainage (AMD) within the <b>spoil</b> <b>pile</b> itself. Since slags form around the melting point of iron,> 2, 700 oF, most compounds which have a low boiling point have been driven off. Most of the residuals are encased as oxides or in a calcium-alumino-silicate glassy matrix. Fortunately, the matrix is soluble and releases calcium and manganese oxides which drive the pH above 10. Since slag is a glass in its coarser form (e. g. - 1 / 8 in.) it will, unless compacted, maintain high permeability regardless of how much water has passed through it.

40|$|This study investigates {{jarosite}} {{formation and}} stability patterns at the abandoned Davis Pyrite Mine in Rowe, Massachusetts. Jarosite, an iron-sulfate hydroxide, {{is found in}} acid mine drainage (AMD) environments, in acid sulfate soils, and on Mars. Jarosite and the iron oxides goethite and hematite are present at the site. Soil samples from the site were examined by XRD, SEM, and EDS. Five mineralogical areas were found, based on mineral abundance patterns. Jarosite exists in four of these areas. Two jarosite morphologies were identified. “Variable” jarosite, with partly-dissolved crystals of about 0. 5 to 5 micrometers diameter, exists in <b>spoil</b> <b>pile</b> samples. “Donut” jarosite, with tightly-packed, sharp-edged crystals less than 0. 5 micrometers that form a thin mantle {{on the surface of}} a second mineral, exists in native soil samples. Donut jarosite has not been previously characterized. These jarosite morphologies are controlled by the presence and relative mobility of pyrite oxidation products Fe and SO 4, which in turn are controlled by water saturation levels. Three pathways are possible. On Path 1, both ions are mobile, go into solution, and variable jarosite forms at a distance from the pyrite source. On Path 2, only sulfur ions are mobile, an iron-oxide gossan develops. No jarosite forms. On Path 3, neither ion is mobile, and donut jarosite forms. On this path, Fe and SO 4 ions are trapped in a thin film of stagnant water covering the pyrite. When sufficient ions are present, donut jarosite precipitates...|$|E
40|$|Coal mine {{waste rock}} (spoil) is a weak {{granular}} material derived from rocks of sedimentary origin. There are plans for mining operations to construct piles of spoil up to 400 m high. Under the consequent burial stresses, the spoil materials undergo substantial compressions, characterised {{not only by}} compaction but also by particle breakdown/disintegration. This leads to significant decreases in void ratio with consequent increases {{in the degree of}} saturation (Sr) at constant water content. In this study, a series of direct shear tests was undertaken on a typical mine spoil derived from Permian-aged sandstones and mudrocks, compressed under stresses of 1 and 3 MPa, with water contents from 0 to 17 %. The samples, with different water contents but compressed under the same stress, all attained similar void ratios, but with degrees of saturation ranging from 25 to 100 %, and corresponding suctions from 140 MPa to 6 kPa. When sheared, these differences in suction produced a difference in measured shear strengths of up to 400 %, with a consistent trend of decreasing shear strength with decreasing suction. By fitting the measured shear strengths to an extended Mohr-Coulomb shear strength framework, both φ and φ b are found to be highly non-linear and suction dependent. Interestingly, when shear strength is plotted against suction on a log scale, the relationship is approximately linear. There is an observed tendency for friction angles to decrease with decreasing suction, and this is shown to be consistent with values back-calculated from <b>spoil</b> <b>pile</b> failures, with the “unsaturated” value of 28 ° found in the literature being consistent with the values interpreted in this work...|$|E
40|$|The {{conventional}} laboratory compression {{testing of}} geo-materials {{is carried out}} in a water bath to create near-saturated materials. The aim of this is reduce the materials to two phases: solids and water, which are both essentially incompressible. This makes {{the results of the}} testing easier to interpret, since if highly compressible air were present the pore volume, degree of saturation and hence matric suction would change continuously during compression. Testing under saturated conditions will also generally represent a worst case situation, inducing greater compression than testing under unsaturated conditions. In addition, the limited scale of conventional laboratory test apparatus restricts the maximum particle size that can be tested. This necessitates that coarse-grained materials, such as coal mine spoil, be scalped to enable laboratory compression testing. Australian coal mine spoil materials selected to cover a range from essentially uncemented rocks to cemented sandstones, were prepared loose in a 150 mm diameter by 150 mm high, 10 MPa oedometer, and subjected to incremental compression under dry (assampled moisture content) and wet (in a water bath) conditions. The dry state represents the as-dumped condition, while the wet state represents the ultimate wetting-up of the material in the <b>spoil</b> <b>pile</b> due to rainfall infiltration and groundwater inflow. In the dry state, the air in the voids of the specimens is free to compress, leading to an increase in the degree of saturation and a decrease in the matric suction. The initial and final moisture contents and densities of the specimens were recorded. In the paper, the results for uncemented and cemented coal mine spoil materials tested under dry and wet conditions are presented and compared with data from the literature...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{describe}} the impact of mine effluent on its environment, and to determine the processes, which influence the geochemistry of the spoil and of surface and groundwater in the Davis Mine Valley. ^ The Davis Pyrite Mine is one of the small abandoned mines in the Berkshire Mts., in Massachusetts. Since the collapse of the mine, in 1911, forest has reclaimed its surroundings, yet the acid mine effluent still affects nearby streams. The spoil and the Davis Mine Creek watershed is a small area enclosed by rocks having minimal carbonate content. It has been untouched by humans for 80 years so the place is ideal for the study of the natural geochemical processes that control such environments. ^ The surface and shallow ground-water in the Davis Mine Valley have low pH (3. 28) and high total dissolved solid content. The upper 30 – 35 cm of the <b>spoil</b> <b>pile</b> is depleted in sulfide and silicate minerals, while it is enriched in iron-oxyhydroxide minerals. The amount of silicate minerals increases with depth. ^ Three main processes determine the mineralogy, geochemistry, and hydrochemistry of the spoil in such a low buffer-capacity environment: (1) The bacterially catalyzed oxidation of pyrite is continuous, so it constantly produces low-pH water and high iron content. The acid water further dissolves minerals hence elevating metal-ion concentrations. (2) The water inflow with a relatively higher pH (rain, snowmelt, unaffected surface and subsurface water) flushes the freshly precipitated soluble constituents, and it dilute the element concentrations in the mixed water meanwhile increasing its pH. This process then enhances adsorption and precipitation. (3) The dynamic dissolution and precipitation of various iron-oxyhydroxides control the iron content of water and buffer the pH between 2. 5 and 3. 5. This low pH inhibits metal ion adsorption on mineral surfaces. ^ Local formation of a surface hardpan layer modified chemical processes in the groundwater. This layer is built up from a crust of goethite and jarosite with low permeability that inhibits O 2 diffusion and surface water infiltration. ...|$|E

Side-scan sonar imagery revealed a submerged surface that was generally flat with no indications of shipwrecks and a large oyster reef along the southwestern quarter. One large metallic feature located within the survey area (Anomaly M 1) was identified as a fallen modern navigational sighting marker tower. None of the archeological survey data, sensor readings, or imagery from the proposed expansion area is consistent with expected signatures of historic-age shipwrecks.
