5|$|Despite the {{presence}} of vegetation, the earth does not yet contain human or animal life, indicating that the scene represents {{the events of the}} biblical Third Day. Bosch renders the plant life in an unusual fashion, using uniformly gray tints which make it difficult to determine whether the subjects are purely vegetable or perhaps include some mineral formations. Surrounding the interior of the globe is the sea, partially illuminated by beams of light <b>shining</b> <b>through</b> clouds. The exterior wings have a clear position within the sequential narrative of the work as a whole. They show an unpopulated earth composed solely of rock and plants, contrasting sharply with the inner central panel which contains a paradise teeming with lustful humanity.|$|E
5|$|Karas is {{the title}} for the city's {{appointed}} agents. Capable of transforming into automobiles and aircraft, they are suits of armor animated by human souls infused into them through Yurine's chanting of a Shinto prayer. Director Sato told his animators to enhance the Karas dark nature by drawing their faces in shadows. Fight scenes involving Karas take place mostly in dark settings shrouded with steam or lit with spotlights. Animators touched up film frames by hand, creating an effect different from cel-shaded animation. To make the Karas more menacing, they highlighted the eyes as if light bulbs were <b>shining</b> <b>through</b> them, a technique inspired by the suitmation practice of using light bulbs for the eyes of costumes. Producer Takaya Ibira explained the presence of ravens in Tokyo and the Tower of London, inspired him and Sato to model the agents of the city after them. He stated ravens {{are believed to be}} omens of good and bad in superstitions, and they always seem to be watching over the cities. This resonated with his view of the raven in the story Noah's Ark, which cursed Noah as it scouted for land. The presence of ravens all over Tokyo led Ibira to notice the same of cats and conceive the Yurines as catgirls.|$|E

25|$|For {{several years}} {{following}} the eruption, {{it was reported that}} the moon appeared to be blue and sometimes green.

25|$|The {{simplest}} {{descriptions of}} diffraction {{are those in}} which the situation {{can be reduced to}} a two-dimensional problem. For water waves, this is already the case, as water waves propagate only {{on the surface of the}} water. For light, we can often neglect one dimension if the diffracting object extends in that direction over a distance far greater than the wavelength. In the case of light <b>shining</b> <b>through</b> small circular holes we will have to take into account the full three-dimensional nature of the problem.|$|E
25|$|The {{cover of}} the album {{was created by the}} Zurich artist Ernst Gamper, with whom Yello had been working since 1982. Gamper painted the picture of a face on a sheet of celluloid, which he then taped to the window of his studio {{overlooking}} Lake Zurich and photographed at sunset, with the setting sun <b>shining</b> <b>through</b> the unpainted eye to create a 'glowing eye' effect. The CD inlay booklet featured a photograph of Blank and Meier standing by the same window, with the painting visible on the window between them.|$|E

25|$|The {{video is}} {{shot in a}} grey room, where Yonezu wearing a flower wreath and long hair {{covering}} his face sits down to read a picture book. The picture book illustrates the song, showing pictures of two hands {{on top of each}} other, and a couple separated in every moment of their lives by a glass pane. Yonezu walks around the room, and finds holes in the room, with light <b>shining</b> <b>through</b> them. Further along there is a barren tree, with the lyrics of the song hanging on it. Yonezu sits under the tree with the book. The girl in the picture book leaves the drawings, leaving the male character alone. Yonezu starts to frantically claw at the holes of light, and falls down. On {{the other side of the}} holes of light, Yonezu performs the song with a band and an orchestra.|$|E
25|$|The {{memorial}} {{is shaped}} like a ship's prow; the crypt is accessible by two staircases and a lowered square protected by a metal portcullis. The crypt leads to a hexagonal rotunda that includes two chapels containing earth and bones from concentration camps. The walls display literary excerpts. Pingusson intended that its long and narrow subterranean space convey a feeling of claustrophobia. The memorial's entrance is narrow, marked by two concrete blocks. Inside is the tomb of an unknown deportee who was killed at the camp in Neustadt. Along both walls of the narrow, dimly lit chamber are 200,000 glass crystals with light <b>shining</b> <b>through,</b> meant to symbolize each of the deportees {{who died in the}} concentration camps; {{at the end of the}} tunnel is a single bright light. Ashes from the camps, contained within urns, are positioned at both lateral ends. Both ends of the chamber have small rooms that seem to depict prison cells. Opposite the entrance is a stark iron gate overlooking the Seine at the tip of the Île de la Cité.|$|E
25|$|As {{the narrator}} reads of the knight's forcible {{entry into the}} dwelling, {{cracking}} and ripping sounds are heard somewhere in the house. When the dragon is described as shrieking as it dies, a shriek is heard, again within the house. As he relates the shield falling from off the wall, a reverberation, metallic and hollow, can be heard. Roderick becomes increasingly hysterical, and eventually exclaims that these sounds are being made by his sister, who was in fact alive when she was entombed. Additionally, Roderick somehow {{knew that she was}} alive. The bedroom door is then blown open to reveal Madeline standing there. She falls on her brother, and both land on the floor as corpses. The narrator then flees the house, and, as he does so, notices a flash of moonlight behind him which causes him to turn back, {{in time to see the}} moon <b>shining</b> <b>through</b> the suddenly widened crack. As he watches, the House of Usher splits in two and the fragments sink into the tarn.|$|E

25|$|On Oahu, a white morph of {{the monarch}} has emerged. This {{is because of}} the introduction, in 1965 and 1966, of two bulbul species, Pycnonotus cafer and Pycnonotus jocosus. They are now the most common {{insectivore}} birds, and probably the only ones preying on insects as large as the monarch. Monarchs in Hawaii are known to have low cardiac glycoside levels, but the birds may also be tolerant of the chemical. The two species hunt the larvae and some pupae from the branches and undersides of leaves in milkweed bushes. The bulbuls also eat resting and ovipositing adults, but rarely flying ones. Because of its color, the white morph has a higher survival rate than the orange one. This is either because of apostatic selection (i.e. the birds have learned the orange monarchs can be eaten), because of camouflage (the white morph matches the white pubescence of milkweed or the patches of light <b>shining</b> <b>through</b> foliage), or because the white morph does not fit the bird's search image of a typical monarch, so is thus avoided.|$|E
25|$|Wartime London has {{featured}} in many films, with The Man Who Loved Redheads and Zeppelin (1971) among those set during the First World War. The 1943 film The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp covered 40 {{years in the}} city, including the Edwardian era, the First World War and the Second World War. Several others made during the Second World War itself, featured London locations, including Millions Like Us (1943) and Waterloo Road (1944). The Blitz featured prominently in the Ealing drama The Bells Go Down (1943), and in Humphrey Jennings' drama-documentary Fires Were Started (1943). The latter featured real firemen recreating scenes from the bombings. At the same time, a number of London-set films were being made in Hollywood, like Waterloo Bridge (1940), Mrs. Miniver (1942) and Forever and a Day (1943). The latter followed several generations of owners of a London house until 1943. Later films set in the city during World War II include The Man Who Never Was (1955), I Was Monty's Double (1958), Battle of Britain (1969), Hanover Street (1979), Hope and Glory (1987), <b>Shining</b> <b>Through</b> (1992) and The End of the Affair (1999), {{as well as some}} low-budget Italian-made war films like Stukas Over London (1970) and From Hell to Victory (1979).|$|E

500|$|Between 1961 and 1963, the Supremes {{released}} six singles, none {{of which}} charted in the Top 40 positions of the BillboardHot100.

During these years, all three members took turns singing lead: Wilson favored soft ballads; Ballard favored soulful, hard-driving songs; and Ross favored mainstream pop songs. Most of their early material was written and produced by Berry Gordy or Smokey Robinson. In December 1963, the single [...] "When the Lovelight Starts <b>Shining</b> <b>Through</b> His Eyes" [...] peaked at number 23 on the Billboard Hot 100.|$|E

[...] Marginally out-rating Cambridge, Oxford passed the Mile Post two and a half lengths ahead and allowed their stroke rate to drop, still maintaining their lead at Hammersmith Bridge. [...] Cambridge spurted at The Doves pub and reduced the deficit marginally but by HMS Stork, the Light Blues were visibly tired and allowed Oxford to draw away once more.|$|E
