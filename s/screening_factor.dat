40|$|Abstract. A Rydberg atom {{embedded}} in a plasma can experience penetration by slowly moving electrons within its volume. The original pure Coulomb potential must now {{be replaced by a}} screened Coulomb potential which contains either a screening length Rs orascreeningfactorA = R − 1 s. For any given discrete energy level, there is a Critical <b>Screening</b> <b>Factor</b> (CSF) Ac beyond which the energy level disappears (by merging into the continuum). Analytical results are obtained for the classical dependence of the energy on the <b>screening</b> <b>factor,</b> for the CSF, and for the critical radius of the electron orbit for Circular Rydberg States (CRS) in this screened Rydberg atom. The results are derived for any general form of the screened Coulomb potential and are applied to the particular case of the Debye potential. We also show that CRS can temporarily exist above the ionization threshold and are therefore the classical counterparts of quantal discrete states {{embedded in}}to continuum. The results are significant not only to Rydberg plasmas, but also to fusion plasmas, where Rydberg states of multi-charged hydrogen-like ions result from charge exchange with hydrogen or deuterium atoms, as well as to dusty/complex plasmas.

40|$|Summary. — We derive the <b>screen</b> <b>factor</b> for the {{radiation}} flux from an optically thick plasma of electron-positron pairs and photons, created by vacuum polarization process around {{a black hole}} endowed with electromagnetic structure. 1. – On the <b>screen</b> <b>factor</b> In our model for Gamma Ray Bursts, based on the electromagnetic black hole (EMBH) creating a dyadosphere[1], there is a plasma made by electron-positron pairs and photons with extremely high density (∼ 10 30 /cm 3). This plasma relativistically expands outward from EMBH {{as soon as it}} is formed. This relativistically expanding plasma of electronpositron pairs and photons evolves with a slab-like profile of constant thickness in the laboratory frame: a pair electromagnetic pulse (PEM- pulse) [2]. In the comoving frame of the PEM pulse, the plasma of electron-positron pairs and photons is assumed to be in thermal equilibrium and characterized by the energy density (ρ), the number density (n e + e −) and the temperature T. Since the pair-number density is very high, the plasma is optically thick reaching the transparency condition only at the surface. In this paper, we evaluate the photon flux F radiated from such a plasma...|$|R

40|$|Literature Review Undernutrition in the {{hospital}} setting {{has been shown to}} cause adverse outcomes. Screening for nutritional risk assists in the detection of undernutrition with subsequent early intervention to prevent further decline. While many nutrition screening tools exist, none are proven to detect undernutrition. Furthermore, many barriers exist for utilizing nurses as primarily responsible for screening patients for nutritional risk. Background A hospital reviewed the nutrition screening process and found that the form used and <b>screening</b> <b>factors</b> were insufficient to adequately detect undernutrition and appropriate referrals for dietitians. Objectives 1) Determine if nursing compliance improved when the nutrition screening form was integrated with the Interdisciplinary Care Plan form. 2) Improve the relevance of the nutrition <b>screening</b> risk <b>factors</b> used and the overall screening tool. Methods The Interdisciplinary Plan of Care form was updated to include the nutrition screening tool and used on the Medical /Surgical unit. Data was also collected on the Intensive Care Unit which continued to use the original screening tool. Results Screening completion did not improve with the implementation of the new screening process, however {{the quality and quantity of}} referrals from the new screening form did improve.

Conclusion Integrating nutrition <b>screening</b> <b>factors</b> into an interdisciplinary plan of care can improve the rate of dietitian referrals.

40|$|Metamodeling of {{large-scale}} simulations {{consisting of a}} large number of input parameters can be very challenging. Neural Networks have shown great promise in fitting these large-scale simulations even without performing <b>factor</b> <b>screening.</b> However, <b>factor</b> <b>screening</b> is an effective method for logically re-ducing the dimensionality of an input space and thus enabling more feasible metamodel calibration. Ap-plying <b>factor</b> <b>screening</b> methods before calibrating Neural Network metamodels or any metamodel can have both positive and negative effects. The critical assumption for <b>factor</b> <b>screening</b> under investigation involves the prevalence of two-way interactions that contain a variable without a significant main effect by itself. In a simulation with a large parameter space, the prevalence of two-way interactions and their contribution to the total variability in the model output is far from transparent. Important questions there-fore arise regarding <b>factor</b> <b>screening</b> and Neural Network metamodels: (a) is this a process worth doing with today’s more powerful computing processors, which provide a larger library of runs to do metamod-eling; and (b), does erroneously screening these buried interaction terms critically impact the level of metamodel fidelity that one can achieve. In this paper we examine these questions through the construc-tion of a case study on a large-scale simulation. This study projects regional homelessness levels per county of interest based on a large array of budget decisions and resource allocations that expand out to hundreds of input parameters. ...|$|R
