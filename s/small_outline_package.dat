50|$|Quadracs are {{available}} {{in a variety of}} integrated circuit (IC) package types with different numbers of pins. Basic IC packages types for quadracs include discrete packaging (DPAK), power packaging (PPAK), and in-line packaging (IPAK). Other IC package types include diode outline (DO), transistor outline (TO), and small outline transistor (SOT). Quadracs that use metal electrode leadless face (MELF) packaging have metallized terminals at each end of a cylindrical body. Other available package types for quadracs include thin <b>small</b> <b>outline</b> <b>package</b> (TSOP), thin shrink small outline L-leaded package (TSSOP), and thin small outline J-lead (TSOJ) package.|$|E
50|$|The quad flat-pack has {{connections}} {{only around}} {{the periphery of}} the package. To increase the number of pins, the spacing was decreased from 50 mil (thousandths of an inch) (as found on <b>small</b> <b>outline</b> <b>packages)</b> to 20 and later 12 mil (1.27 mm, 0.51mm and 0.30mm respectively). However, this close lead spacing made solder bridges more likely and put higher demands on the soldering process and alignment of parts during assembly. The later pin grid array and ball grid array packages, by allowing connections to be made over the area of the package and not just around the edges, allowed for higher pin counts with similar package sizes, and reduced the problems with close lead spacing.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{countries}} have exempted medical and telecommunication infrastructure {{products from the}} legislation. [...] However, {{this may be a}} moot point, since as electronic component manufacturers convert their production lines to producing only lead-free parts, conventional parts with eutectic tin-lead solder will simply not be available, even for military, aerospace and industrial users. To the extent that only solder is involved, this is at least partially mitigated by many lead-free components' compatibility with lead-containing solder processes. Leadframe-based components, such as Quad Flat <b>Packages</b> (QFP), <b>Small</b> <b>Outline</b> Integrated Circuits (SOIC), and <b>Small</b> <b>outline</b> <b>packages</b> (SOP) with gull wing leads, are generally compatible since the finish on the part leads contributes a small amount of material to the finished joint. However, components such as Ball grid arrays (BGA) which come with lead-free solder balls and leadless parts are often not compatible with lead-containing processes.|$|R

The effects of cool-down history on thermomechanical responses of a lead-on-chip (LOC), thin <b>small</b> <b>outline</b> <b>package</b> (TSOP) are investigated. Three linear cool down temperature histories are considered. Numerical results show that residual stresses in a LOC TSOP are significantly influenced by the manufacturing temperature history.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, {{we develop}} {{analytical}} stress {{models for the}} evaluation of thermally induced bows in the following two types of plastic packages: thin elongated packages with large chips, known as thin <b>small</b> <b>outline</b> <b>packages</b> (TSOPs), and high lead count large square packages with relatively small chips, known as plastic quad flat packages (PQFPs). In the case of TSOP packages, we consider the package warpage caused by the thermal contraction mismatch of the constituent materials: silicon chip, metal leadframe, and molding compound. The temperature change is assumed to be the same throughout the package. In the case of PQFP packages, we evaluate the bow due to the temperature gradient (non-uniform distribution of temperature) in the through-thickness direction of the molded body The developed models enable one to evaluate the effect of the package geometry and materials properties on its bow, and more importantly, to design a plastic package with a sufficiently low residual warpage. 1...|$|R

Much effort has been invested by the electronics industry to evaluate and optimize the most popcorn free conditions during the process of packaging and assembly.

A delamination survey of various IC packages from several used electronic products including cellular phones, VCR, discman, display card, graphic card and motherboard for desktop computer is conducted and presented in this paper. C-mode Scanning Acoustic Microscope (C-SAM) and X-ray Microscope is used to investigate delamination and possibly other defects like wire-sweep or cracking.

40|$|The {{shift of}} {{electronics}} industry towards {{the use of}} lead-free solders in components manufacturing brought also the challenge of addressing the problem of tin whiskers. Manufacturers of high reliability and safety critical equipment in sectors such as defence and aerospace rely increasingly {{on the use of}} commercial-of-the-shelf (COTS) electronic components for their products and systems. The use of COTS components with lead-free solder plated terminations comes with the risks for their long term reliability associated with tin whisker growth related failures. In the case of leaded type electronic components such as Quad Flat Package (QFP) and <b>Small</b> <b>Outline</b> <b>Package</b> (SOP), one of the promising solutions to this problem is to “re-finish” the package terminations by replacing the lead-free solder coatings on the leads with conventional tin–lead solder. This involves subjecting the electronic components to a post-manufacturing process known as Hot Solder Dip (HSD). One of the main concerns for adopting HSD (refinishing) as a strategy to the tin whisker problem is the potential risk for thermally induced damage in the components when subjected to this process. This paper details a thermal modelling driven approach to the characterisation of the impact of hot solder dipping on electronic components. Main focus is on the evaluation of the re-finishing process effects on parts’ temperature gradients and heating/cooling rates, and on the advantages of applying an efficient model based process optimisation. Transient thermal finite element analysis is used to evaluate the temperature distribution in Quad Flat Package (QFP) variants during a double-dip hot solder dipping process developed by Micross Components Ltd. Full detailed three-dimensional (3 D) models of the components are developed using comprehensive characterisation of the respective package structures and materials based on X-ray, SEM-EDX, cross-sectional metallurgy and 3 D CT scan. The thermal modelling approach is validated using thermocouple measurement data for one of the studied parts and by comparing with model temperature predictions. Model results have informed the process optimisation strategy, and through experimentation key process parameters are alerted to provide optimal thermal characteristics. The optimised process settings result in temperature ramp rates at die level within recommended manufacture’s limit. A demonstration and discussion on the influence of the package internal structure and design on the thermal response to HSD is also provided...|$|E
