It is an unfortunate reality that in New Zealand there is no equality in access to rights to health, education, and justice due to a various socio-economic obstacles, including <b>structural</b> <b>discrimination.</b> As is acknowledged by the Human Rights Commission, [...] "although frequent citation of negative statistics about inequality can have the unintentional impact of further perpetuating negative messages about Maori and Pacific communities, statistics do provide an evidence base for analysing <b>structural</b> <b>discrimination</b> and encouraging government action." ...|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{assumed that the}} {{integrity}} of the rodent hippocampus is required for learning the spatial distribution of visual elements in an array. Formally assessing this assumption is, however, far from straightforward as standard tests are amenable to alternative strategies. In order to provide a stringent test of this ability rats were trained on three concurrent visual discriminations in a water tank in which the stimuli in each pair of discriminations contained exactly the same elements but they differed in their spatial arrangement e. g. A|B vs. its mirror image B|A. Such ‘structural’ discriminations are a specific subtype of ‘configural’ or ‘nonlinear’ tasks. Following acquisition half of the rats received hippocampal lesions and all rats were retrained on the <b>structural</b> <b>discriminations.</b> Hippocampal lesions impaired the ability to relearn these ‘structural’ discriminations. In contrast, two other groups of rats with similar hippocampal lesions showed no impairment on relearning two non-structural, configural discriminations: transverse patterning and biconditional learning. All three tasks used the same apparatus, the same stimulus elements, and similar training regimes. Superior performance by the rats with hippocampal lesions during a generalization decrement probe showed that hippocampal lesions had diminished sensitivity to ‘structural’ features on the biconditional task. While the rat hippocampus need not be required for all configural learning, {{it is important for the}} special case when the spatial arrangements of the elements are critical. This ability may be a prerequisite for the creation of mental snapshots, which underlie episodic memory...|$|R
40|$|The {{stigma of}} mental illness is a severe burden for people {{suffering}} from mental illness both in private and public life, also affecting their relatives, their close social network, and the mental {{health care system in}} terms of disciplines, providers, and institutions. Interventions against the stigma {{of mental illness}} employ complementary strategies (e. g., protest, education, and contact) and address different target groups (e. g., school children and teachers, journalists, stakeholders). Within this framework, the World Psychiatric Association has adopted an Action Plan with the goal to improve the image of psychiatry and to reduce potential stigmatizing attitudes toward psychiatry and psychiatrists. To evaluate such interventions, a questionnaire has been developed that assesses opinions and attitudes toward psychiatrists and psychiatry in different samples of medical specialists (psychiatrists and general practitioners). the questionnaire comprises scales about perceived stigma in terms of the perception of societal stereotypes, self-stigma in terms of stereotype agreement, perceived stigma in terms of <b>structural</b> <b>discriminations,</b> discrimination experiences, stigma outcomes, and attitudes toward a second medical discipline. It is available in several languages (Arab, English, German, Japanese, Polish, and Spanish) and can easily be adapted for utilization in other medical specialties.

In the caste hierarchy, Dalits - often identified as lower castes and untouchables - were kept at the bottom of the social structure, and this has perpetuated individual, institutional and <b>structural</b> <b>discriminations</b> in Nepal, for example untouchability at public/private sectors, adverse inter-caste marriage consequences, labour and job segregation, and exclusion from socio-economic and political opportunities. Consequently, Dalits have been experiencing difficulty in living a dignified life as defined by international and national human rights conventions. This study focuses on Dalits of Nepal who, according to the National Census 2011, comprise 13. 62 per cent of the total population. It identifies religious belief, rooted in the Hindu religion, as the primary basis of caste-based discrimination, according to which Dalits are supposed to be inherently inferior with respect to their intelligence and aptitude for work. Rampant poverty and illiteracy among Dalits and their political under representation leave them vulnerable to caste-based discrimination in what amounts to a vicious cycle of inequality and discrimination. Illiteracy, poverty (particularly unemployment) and political under representation of Dalits have collectively reinforced caste-based inequality in Nepalese society. It is contended that strengthening governance at the global, national, and community levels may create a conducive environment for achieving caste equality, particularly in terms of improving educational levels that plays a key role in breaking the vicious cycle of discrimination entrenched in the caste system...|$|R

They go on to conclude that a failure to address the causes of New Zealand's socio-economic inequities is itself a form of <b>structural</b> <b>discrimination</b> and that the continuing gap in socio-economic indicators between ethnic groups underscores the need to tackle structural sources of inequality. As such the Commission suggest that a comprehensive policy approach should take into account and seek to address both structural barriers to equality and embedded social and economic factors.|$|E

To explain this research suggests that there are two forms of <b>structural</b> <b>discrimination</b> that exist within the justice system in New Zealand. The first of these is based upon the inherent nature of the New Zealand justice system. This system features a lack of engagement with the affected minorities in policy creation and implementation and demonstrates a lack of cultural sensitivity.

Very often, such <b>structural</b> gender <b>discrimination</b> of women in many other areas has an indirect impact on women's health.

Additionally, within the formal workforce, women often face challenges related to their lower status, where they suffer workplace discrimination and sexual harassment.

Individual women who did not fit into the auxiliary category were singled out as exceptional, but their existence did not challenge gender stereotypes. Through comparative analysis, the paper argues that in both cases <b>structural</b> gender <b>discrimination</b> was ingrained in the military, which accepted women’s contribution to war in times of need, but treated that contribution as subsidiary, thereby distorting men’s and women’s experiences of warfare, and facilitating the instrumentalised militarisation of women...|$|R

Utilizing practice-based examples which have supported the promotion and facilitation of consciousness-raising and the practical skills used to challenge identified injustices, we attempt to refocus on the reasons we work alongside those who are often the most silenced within societies. This chapter draws on the value base of equality and social justice in youth work and community development practices (Smith 2002, Davies 2005, Young 2006, Jeffs and Smith 2010, Taylor 2010) in order to support, defend and rearticulate a social and democratic purpose for emancipatory practice.
