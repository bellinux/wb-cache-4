A demo was released on June 10, 2010 which allowed for players to play various multiplayer matches using two of the game's character classes. [...] Developer High Moon Studios designed the friendly AI so that as a player progresses through the story any accompanying characters will help the player, but still require the player to advance through the game.

60|$|On which point--now that I have <b>shown</b> <b>you</b> <b>where</b> Giotto's St. Louis is --I {{will ask}} you to think awhile, until you are interested; and then I will try to satisfy your curiosity. There fore, please leave the little chapel for the moment, and walk down the nave, till you come to two sepulchral slabs near the west end, and then look about you and see what sort of a church Santa Croce is.|$|R
6000|$|... "I will <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>where</b> {{the stables}} are," [...] she said; [...] "the path divides {{a little farther}} on--and you might find {{yourself}} in the kitchen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, thank you! I'll <b>show</b> <b>you</b> <b>where</b> she is. I don't {{offer to}} take it myself, for I should only get into another scrape if I did." ...|$|E

[...] According to music {{journalist}} Robert Fontenot, Harrison (like Lennon) was [...] "very vocal in his dislike of 'Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da'", and the reference in [...] "Savoy Truffle" [...] {{was his way}} of conveying his opinion of McCartney's song.|$|R
