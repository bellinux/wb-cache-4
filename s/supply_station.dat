5|$|Lansford W. Hastings, {{an early}} {{immigrant}} from Ohio to the West, went to California in 1842 {{and saw the}} promise of the undeveloped country. To encourage settlers, he published The Emigrants' Guide to Oregon and California. He described a direct route across the Great Basin which would bring immigrants through the Wasatch Mountains and across the Great Salt Lake Desert. Hastings had not traveled any part of his proposed shortcut until early 1846 on a trip from California to Fort Bridger. The fort was a scant <b>supply</b> <b>station</b> run by Jim Bridger and his partner Pierre Louis Vasquez in Blacks Fork, Wyoming. Hastings stayed at the fort to persuade travelers to turn south on his route. As of 1846, Hastings was the second of two men documented to have crossed {{the southern part of the}} Great Salt Lake Desert, but neither had been accompanied by wagons.|$|E
5|$|Permanent {{settlement}} on Lord Howe {{was established in}} June 1834 when the British whaling barque Caroline, sailing from New Zealand and commanded by Captain John Blinkenthorpe, landed at what {{is now known as}} Blinky Beach. They left three men, George Ashdown, James Bishop and Chapman, who were employed by a Sydney whaling firm to establish a <b>supply</b> <b>station.</b> The men were initially to provide meat by fishing and by raising pigs and goats from feral stock. They landed with (or acquired from a visiting ship) their Māori wives and two Māori boys. Huts were built in an area now known as Old Settlement which had a supply of fresh water, and a garden was established west of Blinky Beach.|$|E
5|$|RAF Weston-super-Mare {{was opened}} in 1936 by No. 24 Group, {{with a single}} tarmac runway. It served as a flying {{candidates}} selection and initial training facility, and as a relief airport during World War II, latterly as the Polish Air Force Staff College from April 1944 to April 1946. After the war it served as a logistics <b>supply</b> <b>station,</b> with helicopter makers Westland Helicopters on site until closure in 1987. Today there is an operational heliport on site used occasionally by the RAF Search and Rescue service. The former Westland site, which closed in 2002, houses the Helicopter Museum featuring examples of Westland aircraft. Pride of place is given to an immaculate Westland Wessex HCC Mk.4, formerly of the Queen's Flight.|$|E

5|$|The player {{controls}} a British soldier, Sergeant John Davis of the 7th Armoured Division in North Africa, led by Captain Price. The {{first level}} has the player {{taking part in}} a sneak attack on German Afrika Korps troops, ending with the destruction of a German <b>supply</b> <b>station.</b> The next level has the player defending a town from overwhelming numbers of Germans sending counter attacks from North, West, South and East; finally achieving victory by destroying much of the German tank force using artillery. This is followed by the Second Battle of El Alamein, during which the player has to fight through several trenches, machine gun nests, 88millimeter guns and finally taking the German field headquarters. The assault on El Dabaa to intercept the remaining Germans in Egypt and destroy several 88millimeter guns soon follows, ending the first British campaign. An addendum to the second set of missions has the player taking on the role of a British tank commander, David Welsh, while engaging enemies in Libya. The first mission of the third campaign in Toujane, Tunisia, has the player immediately under fire, holding a house until they break out and rendezvous with the second squad. They then retake Toujane with reinforcements the next day all before assaulting Matmata. The final British campaign takes place during the Battle for Caen as part of Operation Overlord.|$|E
25|$|Fort Adair (sometimes called Adair's Station) was a stockade {{fortification}} {{that served}} as a supply depot for early settlers migrating west. The structure was constructed in 1788 or around 1791 at Grassy Valley, an early European settlement in the Appalachian Ridge-and-Valley region of East Tennessee. The presence of a <b>supply</b> <b>station</b> encouraged more Europeans to settle in the vicinity. The town of Fountain Head was founded around Fort Adair by settlers of Grassy Valley and later renamed to Fountain City. Since its annexation in 1962, Fountain City is a neighborhood of northern Knoxville, Tennessee.|$|E
25|$|The first European {{settlers}} in the Cape were the Dutch who, in 1652, established a small <b>supply</b> <b>station</b> at present-day Cape Town for their trading ships to stop for supplies en route {{to and from the}} East Indies. European settlement in and around Cape Town later spread into the valleys. By {{the second half of the}} 18th century, Europeans, predominantly trekboers, moved eastward up the coast and encountered the Xhosa in the region of the Great Fish River. The Xhosa were already established in the area and herded cattle. Competition for land ensued, particularly after the arrival of several groups of British {{settlers in}} 1820.|$|E
40|$|In the Mekong Delta (MD) in Vietnam, piped-water <b>supply</b> <b>stations</b> {{are being}} intensively built {{to reach the}} {{millennium}} development goal (MDG) to provide safe and clean drinking water resources to communities. However, studies focusing {{on the effectiveness of}} <b>supply</b> <b>stations</b> in reaching these goals are scarce to date. Water samples from 41 water <b>supply</b> <b>stations</b> in the MD were collected between June and October 2012. Water samples were analyzed for general parameters, salinity, nutrients, metal(loid) s and microbial indicator bacteria and compared with World Health Organization (WHO) and Vietnamese drinking water guidelines. In addition, 542 household interviews were conducted to investigate the connection rate to piped-water and people’s perceptions regarding piped-water supplies. The results show that water guidelines were exceeded for pH (min. 6. 2), turbidity (max. 10 FTU), Cl (max. 1, 576 mg·L− 1), NH 4 (max. 7. 92 mg·L− 1), Fe (431. 1 µg·L− 1), Hg (11. 9 µg·L− 1), and microbial indicator bacteria (max. total coliform 50, 000 CFU 100 mL− 1). Moreover, {{more than half of the}} interviewed households with access to a piped-water supply did not use this supply as a source of drinking water due to (i) high connection fees; (ii) preference for other water sources; and (iii) perceived poor quality/quantity. Our study shows that the maintenance and distribution of water <b>supply</b> <b>stations</b> should significantly improve in order for piped-water to become a reliable drinking water source. Additionally, alternatives, such as rainwater harvesting and decentralized treatment facilities, should also be considered...|$|R

25|$|Throughout the 19th century, Malta {{benefited from}} {{increased}} defence spending by Britain, {{particularly from the}} development of the dockyards and the harbour facilities. The Crimean War and the opening of the Suez Canal further enhanced Malta's importance as a <b>supply</b> <b>station</b> and as a naval base. Prosperity brought with it a dramatic rise in the population, from 114,000 in 1842, to 124,000 in 1851, 140,000 in 1870, and double that amount by 1914. Malta became increasingly urbanized, with {{the majority of the population}} inhabiting the Valletta and the Three Cities. Malta's fortunes waned during times of peace in the early 20th century, and again after World War II, leading to massive waves of emigration.|$|E
25|$|Captain John Adair (17321827), {{a native}} of Ireland, built Fort Adair either in 1788 or around 1791 at Grassy Valley, Tennessee. The station was {{intended}} to provide supplies for westward-bound migrants and {{to protect them from}} hostile Cherokee Indians during the years of the Cherokee–American wars. The existence of a supply depot attracted European settlers to the area and contributed {{to the development of a}} settlement around the fortification. Nearby springs provided a constant source of fresh water. Fort Adair served as a <b>supply</b> <b>station</b> for the Cumberland Guard and later for the town of Nashborough, which would become modern Nashville. The Cumberland Guard was a militia organization providing armed protection to migrants to the Cumberland settlements, which would later develop into the town of Nashborough.|$|E
25|$|When Bartolomeu Dias {{and other}} Portuguese explorers first {{encountered}} the Cape of Good Hope in the 15th century, they found little motivation to colonize the sparse and empty land around the Cape. In the early 17th century, the Dutch trading port of Batavia, {{in what is}} now Indonesia, grew to such a size that trading vessels were regularly dispatched on the long voyage from the Netherlands to Asia. The managers of the Dutch East India Company began looking for a logical midway point on the voyage to build a <b>supply</b> <b>station</b> that would serve the sailors making the voyage to and from Asia. In 1652, a Dutch surgeon named Jan van Riebeeck was commissioned with the task of building both a fort and farming community in the Cape.|$|E

500|$|Control of the Mississippi River {{was the key}} {{to victory}} in the Western theater. Believing Grant was a general of [...] "dogged persistence" [...] and [...] "iron will", Major General John C. Frémont {{assigned}} Grant to command troops on the Mississippi at Cairo, Illinois at the end of August (passing over generals John Pope and Benjamin Prentiss). Frémont dismissed rumors of Grant's drunkenness years earlier in the regular army, saying there was something about Grant's manner [...] "that was sufficient to counteract the influence of what they said." [...] Cairo was a bustling Union military and naval base that was to be used to launch a joint campaign down the Mississippi, Tennessee, and Cumberland Rivers. After the Confederates moved into western Kentucky, with designs on Southern Illinois, Grant, under Frémont's authority, advanced on Paducah, Kentucky, taking it without a fight, and set up a <b>supply</b> <b>station.</b> Having understood the importance to Lincoln in keeping Kentucky in the Union, Grant assured its citizens, [...] "I have come among you not as your enemy, but as your friend." [...] On November 1, Frémont ordered Grant to [...] "make demonstrations" [...] against the Confederates {{on both sides of the}} Mississippi, but prohibited him from attacking the enemy.|$|E
2500|$|RAF {{training}} {{in conjunction with}} RAF Locking continued after the World War II, but also civilian flights resumed. In 1955, the old Beaufighter factory at Oldmixon was converted {{for use by the}} Bristol Aeroplane Company Helicopter Division, headed by helicopter pioneer Raoul Hafner, that transferred there from Filton. Production at the site included the Sycamore, that was the first British-designed helicopter to fly and serve with the Royal Air Force, that used it for search and rescue and anti-submarine warfare. The Belvedere followed, a twin-engine, tandem rotor military helicopter. [...] It was designed for a variety of transport roles including troop transport, supply dropping and casualty evacuation. [...] It was operated by the Royal Air Force from 1961 to 1969. In 1960, the factory was taken over by Westland, and served as a logistics <b>supply</b> <b>station,</b> until closure in 1987.|$|E
2500|$|The {{early history}} of South African wine {{can be traced to}} the {{founding}} of a <b>supply</b> <b>station</b> at the Cape of Good Hope by the Dutch East India Company. Jan van Riebeeck was given the task of managing the station and planting vineyards to produce wine and grapes in the Wijnberg (Wine mountain Area); that could be used to ward off scurvy for sailors continuing on their voyages along the spice route. [...] In 1685, another Cape Governor, Simon van der Stel, purchased a large [...] estate, founding what later became the world-renowned Constantia wine estate. In the 19th century, South Africa fell under British rule which proved lucrative for the wine industry as South African wine flowed into the British market. This prosperity lasted until the 1860s when the Cobden-Chevalier Treaty signed by the Palmerston government and France reduced the preferential tariffs that benefited South African wine in favor of French wine exports.|$|E

2500|$|The {{roots of}} the South African wine {{industry}} {{can be traced to}} the explorations of the Dutch East India Company, which established a <b>supply</b> <b>station</b> in what is now Cape Town. A Dutch surgeon, Jan van Riebeeck, was assigned the task of managing the station and planting vineyards to produce wines and grapes. This was intended to ward off scurvy amongst sailors during their voyages along the spice route to India and the East. The first harvest and crushing took place in 1659, seven years after the landing in 1652. The man succeeding Van Riebeeck as governor of the Cape of Good Hope, Simon van der Stel, sought to improve the quality of viticulture in the region. In 1685, he purchased a large [...] estate just outside Cape Town, establishing the Constantia wine estate. After Van der Stel's death, the estate fell into disrepair, but was revived in 1778 when it was purchased by Hendrik Cloete.|$|E

The energy <b>supply</b> <b>stations</b> grow along with the industrial park(s) as new industries are attracted by a reliable, reasonably priced energy source. This paper describes the generic NIPES concept and summarizes the results of the evaluation of a specific NIPES system for the Lake Charles, Louisiana, area. The economics of the specific NIPES system is compared to that of individual user-owned coal-fired facilities for new industrial plants and of individual user-owned oil-fired facilities for existing industrial plants. The results indicate substantial savings associated with the NIPES system for both new and existing users and/or a potential for high return on investment by third-party investors...|$|R

In this paper, the technical reliability and practicability of crop straw gasification technologies, the economic feasibility of gas <b>supply</b> <b>stations,</b> the economic feasibility of crop straw gasification equipment manufacture enterprises and the social acceptability of crop straw gasification technologies are analyzed. The results show that presently both the atmospheric oxidation gasification technology and the carbonization pyrolysis gasification technology in China are mature and practical, and can provide fuel gas for households. However, {{there are still a}} series of problems associated with these technologies that need to be solved for the commercialization development, such as the high tar and CO content of the fuel gas. The economic feasibility of the gas <b>supply</b> <b>stations</b> is different in China. Parts of gas <b>supply</b> <b>stations</b> are unprofitable due to high initial investment, the low fuel gas price and the small numbers of consumers. In addition, the commercialization development of crop straw gasification equipment manufacture enterprises is hindered for the low market demand for gasification equipment which is related to the fund support from the government. The acceptance of the crop straw gasification technologies from both the government and the farmers in China may be a driving force of further commercialization development of the gasification technologies. Then, the crop straw gasification technologies in China have reached at the stage of pre-commercialization. At this stage, the gasification technologies are basically mature and have met many requirements of commercialization, however, some incentives are needed to encourage their further development...|$|R
