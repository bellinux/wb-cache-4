60|$|The {{case is that}} of Madame B., {{a peasant}} woman near Cherbourg. She has her common work-a-day personality, called, for convenience, 'Leonie.' There is also her {{hypnotic}} personality, 'Leontine.' Now Leontine (that is, Madame B. in a somnambulistic state) was one day hysterical and troublesome. Suddenly she exclaimed in terror that she heard A VOICE ON THE LEFT, crying, 'Enough, be quiet, you are a nuisance.' She hunted in vain for the speaker, who, of course, was inaudible to M. Janet, though he was present. This sagacious speaker (a faculty of Madame B.'s own nature) is 'brought out' by repeated passes, and when this moral and <b>sensible</b> <b>phase</b> of her character is thus evoked, Madame B. is 'Leonore.' Madame B. now sometimes assumes an expression of beatitude, smiling and looking upwards. As Dunois said of Jeanne when she was recalling her visions, 'miro modo exsultabat, levando suos oculos ad coelum.' This ecstasy Madame B. (as Leonie) dimly remembers, averring that 'she has been dazzled BY A LIGHT ON THE LEFT SIDE.' Here apparently {{we have the best}} aspect of poor Madame B. revealing itself in a mixture of hysterics and hypnotism, and associating itself with an audible sagacious voice and a dazzling light on the left, both hallucinatory.|$|E

40|$|Extremely {{premature}} born infants often show {{psychomotor development}} deficits {{and the extent}} of these deficits correlates linearly with increased immaturity. The diffuse white matter damage is one critical point in brain injury in preterm infants. Intrauterine infection, a frequent reason for premature birth, and relative hyperoxia, which inevitably occurs after birth and results in a dramatically rise in oxygen tissue tension, are discussed pathomechanisms in the death of oligodendroglial precursor cells, which is present in the diffuse white matter damage. In the present study the <b>sensible</b> <b>phase</b> of hyperoxia-induced damage of the white matter was determined and the dependence of vulnerability on maturity state of primary rat oligodendrocytes was verified. Subsequently cell culture and animal experiments were expanded by a time-defined inflammatory trigger and combined with hyperoxia in the <b>sensible</b> <b>phase</b> mentioned earlier. Both in vivo and in vitro, the inflammation results in a partial protection against hyperoxia-induced cell death. The protective properties of the inflammatory reaction are presumably based on the increased expression of interleukin- 10 and superoxide-dismutase. Beside the beneficial properties inflammation causes a reduced maturation of the oligodendrocytes. It bears mentioning that myelination-processes and the microstructure of the white matter are equally impaired after inflammation-induced impaired maturation and hyperoxia-induced cell death. Inflammation, hyperoxia and the combination of both noxious stimuli cause the same severity of harm to the immature brain, but the underlying mechanisms are significantly different...|$|E

A uniform ADC, which {{is characterized by a}} <b>sensible</b> <b>phase</b> inaccuracy depending on frequency, is connected to a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) processor, that is especially affected by a round-off amplitude noise linked to both the FFT register length and samples number. If the register length is equal to 32 bits, then the round-off noise is entirely negligible, else, once bits are reduced to 16, a technique of compensation must occur. In fact, oversampling can be employed within a short time window, reaching a compromise between the needs of limiting the phase inaccuracy due to ADC and not raising too much the number of averaged FFT values sufficient to bound the round-off. Finally, the appendix presents an outline of somewhat lengthy demonstrations needed to calculate the amplitude and especially phase inaccuracies due to the round-off noise of FFT processors.

40|$|The latest {{scientific}} acquisitions are demonstrating {{what has}} already been hypothesized {{for more than twenty}} years about the development of the state of health/illness of individuals. Indeed, certain stimuli, if applied to a <b>sensible</b> <b>phase</b> of development, are able to modify, through epigenetic mechanisms, gene expression of DNA, resulting in adaptive modifications of phenotype to the environment, which may reflect negatively on the health of every individual. This concept, applied to nutrition, has opened up important prospects for research in this area. The nutritional history of an individual, linked to the development of a healthy state, would begin very early. In fact, since the pregnancy and for the next two years (for a total of about 1000 days), the maternal eating habits, the type of breastfeeding and then the main stages of nutrition in the evolutionary phase represent those sensitive moments, essential for the development of important endocrine, metabolic, immunological alterations, better known as metabolic syndrome. This condition would represent the physiopathogenetic basis for explaining a series of disorders, known as non communicable diseases (NCDs) such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascolar disease and all those conditions that today affect the health of most industrialized countries and through the years are emerging especially in developing countries (South America, Asia), where new environmental conditions and increased food availability are changing food habits, with far-reaching public health impacts.

40|$|Thermal {{heat storage}} systems {{are used to}} improve energy {{efficiency}} of power plants {{and the use of}} process heat. They are also required for continuous energy supply in solar thermal applications. Thermo-chemical reactions offer an option for high temperatures where common <b>sensible</b> or <b>phase</b> change materials are not available. In the framework of a major research project, DLR research is focused on the temperature range from 300 to 1000 °C, while the University of Stuttgart (Institute for Thermodynamics and Thermal Engineering) will investigate low-temperature reactions for long-term heat storage. Because of their high energy density and low cost gas-solid reactions are promising candidates for such systems, especially decomposition reactions of metal hydroxides and carbonates. Main concerns are the correct integration of the complex energy and mass flows into the thermo-chemical system, structural changes of materials, and heat transfer restrictions due to low thermal conductivity. In an initial study, the system requirements and suitability of various materials were identified. However, problems with cycling stability of calcium hydroxide and carbonate were observed during the first thermo-gravimetric measurements. To understand mechanisms and limitations on transport in a packed bed reactor, a 3 D-model solved by Finite-Element-Method has been developed to describe heat and mass transfer during the reactions. It was implemented into a simulation tool to compare different design concepts. This presentation reports on the influence of the main parameters in the packed bed. Possibilities for enhancing the thermal conductivity in case of indirect and direct heat transfer concepts are evaluated based on simulation results. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{scarcity}} and the up scaling cost {{of fossil}} fuels have forced everyone {{to look out for}} an alternative sources of energy. Most of the process heat requirements of industries fall in the temperature range of 125 - 350 0 C where solar concentrating collectors can meet most of the requirement. One of the most common problems that solar power generation systems face is the gap that exists between the availability of the solar resource and energy demand, causing the need for an effective method by which excess heat collected during periods of high solar irradiation can be stored and retrieved later for use at night or during periods of darkness. The literature survey indicates that considerable amount of work in the area of thermal energy storage is concerned with either sensible heat storage system or latent heat storage systems only and not much reported on the combined sensible and latent heat storage systems. Moreover, very limited attempts are made in the high temperature actual solar concentrating systems of considerable size. The purpose of this work is to investigate experimentally the thermal analysis of the concentrating solar system with <b>sensible</b> (without <b>phase</b> change material, PCM) and latent heat energy storage system. A 16 m 2 solar concentrating collector was used for this purpose. A heat exchanger was designed and fabricated to house the phase change material. A thermic fluid was pumped into the system via solar concentrator. The experimental results in the form of charging efficiency and overall efficiency with latent heat and without latent heat storage (only sensible) were presented. During the discharging experiments it was observed that the combined system performs much better than the mere sensible storage type system without phase change material for latent heat storage...|$|R
40|$|The two-tank {{molten salt}} {{thermal energy storage}} (TES) system in CSP plants is limited by cost, environmental, and {{operational}} issues. The literature on TES systems suggests a few promising alternatives, but several key questions remain unanswered. Thus, the present work aims to investigate what is the ‘best’ way forward for high temperature TES materials and systems? Attempting to answer this, however, opens up several other important questions: How can complicated underlying physical phenomena (phase change and natural convection) {{be incorporated into the}} design process? How do these systems techno-economically compare against each other? Answering these questions requires detailed annual integrated analysis. As a first step, it was found that alternative TES systems require alternative operational modes and control strategies, which motivated the author to develop appropriate off-design models for the receiver and the Rankine cycle. Additionally, it was noticed that full fundamental mathematical models for high temperature shell-and-tube TES systems were not available, so, this work expanded the literature by: (i) Determining the circumstances under which natural convection must be considered through proposing error correlations and (ii) Developing natural convection Nusselt correlations that can be used via the effective thermal conductivity method. After developing and validating these mathematical models, along with pulling other salient models from the literature, an integrated system model was developed for comparative analysis amongst all alternatives (including various <b>sensible</b> and <b>phase</b> change systems). It was shown that pushing the CSP plant to regions far from its design point, an ideal performance of two-tank systems with alternatives TES systems can be achieved with a minimal difference in terms of annual electricity generation. Economically, a maximum reduction of 60 % compared to two-tank systems was obtained with a thermocline system with concrete filler in terms of the total TES specific cost, followed by ~ 50 % reduction with pipeless shell-and-tube systems with concrete. Shifting from solid fillers to compact low cost PCMs can lead to ~ 60 % reduction in shell-and-tube system with embedded pipes, but only a 40 % reduction was achieved for a thermocline system. The least desirable system for future development was a single medium thermocline system with ~ 20 % reduction capacity...|$|R

Equipment was designed and built to pass a stream of gas through a bed at a controlled rate, pressure and temperature. The pressure drop characteristic was found to conform to Ergun equation and the constants for the application of that relation to a commonly available granular active carbon established. A mathematical model based on a finite difference technique was created and used to predict the progress of a temperature front in the bed and derive the heat transfer characteristics from experimental data. Heat transfer coefficients measured with argon and ammonia appeared inconsistent with each other and after investigations of the data and comparison with established correlations were made it was concluded that carbon during the argon experiments had been contaminated.

TOUGH has been developed in the Earth Sciences Division of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). Many modifications and enhancements {{have been made to}} TOUGH (at LBNL and elsewhere) from the time it was first released in 1987. TOUGH and its various descendants (such as iTOUGH 2, T 2 VOC, TMVOC, EWASG, TOUGHREACT, TOUGH+ and many more) are currently in use in approximately 300 research laboratories, private companies, and universities in 33 countries. The LBNL group, headed by Karsten Pruess, serves as custodian of the code. The TOUGH simulators were developed for problems involving strongly heat-driven flow. To describe these phenomena a multi-phase approach to fluid and heat flow is used, which fully accounts for the movement of gaseous and liquid phases, their transport of latent and <b>sensible</b> heat, and <b>phase</b> transitions between liquid and vapor. TOUGH takes account of fluid flow in both liquid and gaseous phases [...] and, in certain modules, a non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) [...] occurring under pressure, viscous, and gravity forces according to Darcy's law. Interference between the phases is represented by means of relative permeability functions. The code includes Klinkenberg effects and binary diffusion in the gas phase, and capillary and phase adsorption effects for the liquid phase. Heat transport occurs by means of conduction (with thermal conductivity dependent on water saturation), convection, and binary diffusion, which includes both sensible and latent heat. The goal of this training course is to teach participants with limited numerical modeling experience the fundamental concepts of modeling with the TOUGH family of codes. The material to be covered includes the following: Introduction to the TOUGH family of codes and applications; Underlying physics, mathematical models, and numerical approaches; Program structure and code installation; and Explanation of input and output files. The course will revolve around sample problems that are meant to familiarize users with TOUGH modeling concepts, such as grid generation, specification of material properties, initial and boundary conditions, and program control The most common equation of state (EOS) modules will be considered for a variety of applications and levels of complexity (ranging from isothermal problems with a single component and phase, to non-isothermal problems with multiple components and phases) Examples of advanced applications from the TOUGH family of codes, will be presented...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Instantaneous {{availability}} {{of power is}} taken for granted {{in much of the}} developed world. Provided a fuel source is unlimited and readily available, the expectation of instant power is readily fulfilled with available technology. However, it is now accepted that human kind’s most utilised fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) are in fact diminishing and their availability cannot be guaranteed as demand outstrips supply. Not only supply limitations exist, the burning of these fuels contributes heavily to dangerous climate change. Thus technology needs to be developed to efficiently utilise fuels intermittently or take advantage of other energy sources which may also be intermittent. Thermal energy storage devices store heat energy through <b>sensible</b> heating, a <b>phase</b> change or a combination of the two. A device can be coupled to a power cycle to provide thermal inertia to the system. Power cycles that generate electricity from an intermittent heat source are an obvious application. Applications also exist in industrial processes requiring continuous heat for drying or a chemical reaction and control of air temperature in sensitive environments. Many thermal energy storage devices exist, tailored to particular temperature ranges and storage capacities. This thesis introduces the Miscibility Gap Alloy as a potential thermal storage technology. Miscibility Gap Alloys overcome a number of the shortcomings of molten salt, paraffin and sensible storage media but their properties are not yet well communicated. Material properties, lifetime estimates, economic characteristics and implementations of Miscibility Gap Alloys are discussed in this dissertation. Through analysis of these aspects a number of novel methodologies, theories and devices were developed. The Lattice Monte Carlo method was successfully employed to model effective conductivity of binary composites. The results of these analyses and existing homogenisation models were generalised for volume fraction and constituent conductivity ratio through a novel concept titled ‘microstructural efficiency’. This work enabled the effective thermal conductivity (and indeed any 2 nd rank tensor property obeying Fick’s Law) to be estimated with great accuracy for a number of idealised and common morphologies with generality in volume fraction and conductivity ratio of constituents. Best practice manufacturing methods for different Miscibility Gap Alloys were identified through experiment and presented. This led to knowledge of the morphology of the materials (including potential porosity). From this, good estimates were made of all material properties relevant to the alloys use as thermal storage. The hypothesised material property advantages of Miscibility Gap Alloys are thus confirmed and compared with the existing state of the art. A discussion of the long term behaviour of Miscibility Gap Alloys follows. Consideration is given to diffusion as well as mechanical and chemical dominated aging mechanisms. It was found that diffusion dominated aging is most likely for systems with non-negligible solubility of the components and where discrete large powders undergo large temperature changes through cycling. Mechanical effects should not contribute beyond the first few cycles as the matrix deforms to accommodate any mismatch in thermal expansion. Chemical aging is likely for systems exposed to air or water but may be mitigated through isolation of the material. Establishment of material and long term properties of the alloys enables a discussion of the comparative economics of using Miscibility Gap Alloys as thermal storage. The alloys are shown to be extremely competitive compared to existing thermal energy storage solutions. They have a higher capital cost generally, due to the high cost of metals. However, the infrastructure and maintenance costs required are a fraction of that for most other thermal storage media. Finally a number of potential implementations are introduced ranging from thermal inertia for power production to heating for the drying of foods. Detailed calculations and engineering drawings are provided for an air heater device intended for room heating. Specific methods of storage for concentrated solar thermal plants are described before more exotic implementations are presented. The thesis concludes with a summary of work and a critical evaluation of the potential of Miscibility Gap Alloys as thermal storage media. Potential work for future research is provided with guidance as to how it might be initiated...|$|R
