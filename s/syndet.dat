50|$|Simoniz USA {{was formed}} {{as a result of}} a {{purchase}} by <b>Syndet</b> Products, Inc. of the Simoniz brand name in 1997 from First Brands Corp. <b>Syndet,</b> at the time, was a 25-year-old manufacturer of hard surface detergents, cleaners and waxes, serving the automotive, institutional and industrial marketplaces. Simoniz was already a part of consumer product and advertising history and lore.|$|E
50|$|In 1997, <b>Syndet</b> Products {{purchased}} the Simoniz brand from First Brands Corp., and renamed the company Simoniz USA, Inc. The Simoniz brand {{is now one}} of the most advertised brands in the automotive care appearance industry. In 2000 and 2001, spurred by the successful launch of the Simoniz Detailer's Brushless Carwash, Simoniz produced over one billion consumer impressions and reestablished the brand as an innovative market leader.|$|E
50|$|In 1986, {{as a part}} of the {{divestiture}} of Union Carbide, {{a management}} lead LBO called First Brands Corp. was formed and Simoniz was among the brands purchased. In 1988, First Brands entered into a license agreement with <b>Syndet</b> Products, Inc. to manufacture and distribute on-line Simoniz brand products nationally to the car wash industry, which eventually expanded to include detail shop and janitorial/sanitation (JanSan) cleaning products.|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} the pH value of children's antibacterial soaps and <b>syndets</b> used in children's baths and verify {{whether there is}} information regarding pH on the product label. MethodsQuantitative, cross-sectional, analytical observational study that included ninety soap samples, both in bar and liquid presentations, as follows: 67 children's soap (group 1), 17 antibacterial soaps (group 2), and 6 <b>syndets</b> (group 3). Each sample had its pH measured after 1 % dilution. In addition to descriptive statistics, the Pearson–Yates chi-squared test and Student's t-tests were applied, considering the minimal significance level of 5 %. The Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test, Fisher's exact test, and the Kruskal–Wallis test were used for inferential statistics. ResultsThe pH levels varied considerably between liquid and bar presentations, with lower levels (4. 4 – 7. 9) found for the liquids (p< 0. 05). <b>Syndets</b> showed pH levels close to the ideal (slightly acid) and the antibacterial soaps showed the highest pH levels (up to 11. 34) (p< 0. 05). Only two of the soaps {{included in the study}} had information about their pH levels on the product packaging. ConclusionsKnowledge of the pH of children's soap by doctors and users is important, considering the great pH variability found in this study.

40|$|The correct {{choice of}} {{cosmetic}} products and cleansers {{is very important}} to improve skin hydration, to provide moisturizing benefits and to minimize cutaneous damage caused by surfactants. In fact, surfactants may damage protein structures and solubilize lipids. Soaps, defined as the alkali salts of fatty acids, are the oldest surfactants and are quite aggressive. <b>Syndets</b> (synthetic detergents) vary in composition and surfactant types (anionic, cationic, amphotheric, non-ionic). These new skin cleansing products also contain preservatives, fragrances, and sometimes emollients, humectants and skin nutrients. We present a revision of the literature and discuss recent findings regarding skin cleansers...|$|R
50|$|Soap is, by weight, {{relatively}} {{ineffective and}} it is highly sensitive to deactivation by hard water. By the 1950s, soap had almost been completely replaced by branched alkylbenzenesulfonates, but these detergents {{were found to be}} poorly biodegradable. Linear alkylbenzenesulfonates (LABs), however, proved to be both highly effective in cleaning and more biodegradable than the branched relatives. LABs remain the main detergents used domestically. Other detergents that have been developed include the linear alkylsulfonates and olefinsulfonates, which also resist deactivation by hard water. Both remain specialty products, for example only an estimated 60 million kilograms of the sodium alkylsulfonates are produced annually. During the early development of non-soap surfactants as commercial cleaning products, the term <b>syndet,</b> short for synthetic detergent, was promoted to indicate the distinction from so-called natural soaps.|$|E
40|$|In adipocytes, insulin {{stimulates the}} {{translocation}} of the glucose transporter, GLUT 4, from an intracellular storage compartment {{to the cell}} surface. Substantial evidence exists to suggest that in the basal state GLUT 4 resides in discrete storage vesicles. A direct interaction of GLUT 4 storage vesicles with the plasma membrane has been implicated because the v-SNARE, vesicle-associated membrane protein- 2 (VAMP 2), {{appears to be a}} specific component of these vesicles. In the present study we sought to identify the cognate target SNAREs for VAMP 2 in mouse 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes. Membrane fractions were isolated from adipocytes and probed by far Western blotting with the cytosolic portion of VAMP 2 fused to glutathione S-transferase. Two plasma membrane-enriched proteins, p 25 and p 35, were specifically labeled with this probe. By using a combination of immunoblotting, detergent extraction, and anion exchange chromatography, we identified p 35 as Syntaxin- 4 and p 25 as the recently identified murine SNAP- 25 homologue, <b>Syndet</b> (mSNAP- 23). By using surface plasmon resonance we show that VAMP 2, Syntaxin- 4, and <b>Syndet</b> form a ternary SDS-resistant SNARE complex. Microinjection of anti- <b>Syndet</b> antibodies into 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes, or incubation of permeabilized adipocytes with a synthetic peptide comprising the C-terminal 24 amino acids of <b>Syndet,</b> inhibited insulin-stimulated GLUT 4 translocation to the cell surface by ~ 40 %. GLUT 1 trafficking remained unaffected by the presence of the peptide. Our data suggest that Syntaxin- 4 and <b>Syndet</b> are important cell- surface target SNAREs within adipocytes that regulate docking and fusion of GLUT- 4 -containing vesicles with the plasma membrane in response to insulin...|$|E

40|$|Background/aims: Irritant {{reactions}} to surfactants, cleansing products, soaps and detergents {{are common in}} clinical and occu-pational dermatology. Mildness {{has become a major}} benefit claimed, and testing for mildness now ranks among the first con-cerns of the manufacturing industry. A wealth of publications deals with this problem, trying to improve the methodology, re-duce the costs of testing and facilitate decision-making. Differ-ences in vivo can be measured clinically and/or instrumentally. This is difficult, as commercially available products are generally safe to use and none are harsh in the absolute sense. Methods: Nineteen different products (<b>syndets,</b> shampoos, per-sonal cleansers), all claiming to be mild, were tested in vitro by a newly introduced method, corneosurfametry. For evaluating the aggressiveness of the products, the calculation of an index of irritation (IOI) was proposed. A concentration-effect curve of so...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: In {{people with}} darkly {{pigmented}} skin, classified as Fitzpatrick type IV, V, or VI skin, xerosis or dry skin can {{be associated with}} a whitish coloring and a reduction in skin shininess known as “ashiness. ” The authors investigated whether mild and moisturizing cleansers can repair dry skin in people with type IV, V, or VI skin by improving barrier function and reducing ashiness. Design: This study has a balanced, randomized, double-blind monadic design comprising two cells of approximately 30 participants per cell. Participants were randomly assigned to either receive the marketed directly esterified fatty isethionate-based moisturizing body wash or the marketed <b>syndet</b> bar for general bathing purposes for three weeks. Setting: A clinical testing facility in Dallas, Texas. Participants: Healthy women with visible signs of ashy skin on their lower legs, forearms, and elbows. Measurements: Skin assessments were performed at six defined sites and included expert visual grading of dryness, dermatologist grading of ashiness, instrumental measurements, and a self-assessment questionnaire. Results: Twenty-seven participants received body wash and 28 participants received the <b>syndet</b> bar. Use of body wash was associated with significant improvement in transepidermal water loss and expert- and self-assessed dryness. Participants reported reduced ashiness at all sites after use of body wash. Similar results were seen with use of the <b>syndet</b> bar. Conclusion: In study participants with type IV, V, or VI skin, regular use of the body wash or <b>syndet</b> bar repaired the condition of the skin, improving barrier function and reducing visual dryness. Support of the epidermal barrier by mild and moisturizing cleansers was associated with reduced ashiness...|$|E
40|$|Background/aims: The skin {{irritation}} {{potential of a}} body cleansing product is often compared under exaggerated test conditions, although the product {{is intended to be}} used at home with repetitive and brief contact with the skin. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine how much patch testing is predictive of the clinical, sub-clinical and subjective cutaneous effects of products used at home by consumers for their normal hygienic cleansing. Methods: A double-blind comparative study of the normal use of an alkaline soap bar and a <b>syndet</b> at home during 10 consecutive weeks was performed on two identical groups of 25 healthy female subjects. The eventual skin changes observed at different anatomical skin sites were evaluated by clinical visual examination and by bioengineering measurements before the start of the study and then every 2 weeks. The objective measurements were compared with the subject's perceptions of dryness, tightness and product irritancy during the testing. Results: The bioengineering measurements did not show any significant changes on all the anatomical skin sites, except for a small increase in skin pH with the classical soap bar. However, a trend appeared, showing that the alkaline soap bar is perceived by the subjects themselves as more of an irritant than the <b>syndet</b> bar. In the soap chamber test, the bar soap showed a significantly higher irritancy than the <b>syndet</b> bar. Conclusion: This study showed that cutaneous irritation induced by cleansing products in patch testing is not necessarily predictive of the irritation likely to occur in normal use conditions. Finally, a clear relationship could be demonstrated between the results of the soap chamber test and the consumer perception of both cleansing bars.

40|$|Studies on {{the role}} of {{cleansing}} bars in skin irritancy have focused on pH and composition. The rinsability factor is ignored by chamber style tests but seems to be significant in usage experience. In order to understand the differences een in chamber and use testing, 18 common soap, combats, and <b>syndet</b> bars were studied for their rinsing characteristics, which were compared to their irritancy potential. The relative rinsabilities of the products were determined photographically and spectrophotometrically using soap solu-tions spiked with fluorescein dye. The dye-containing soap solutions were applied to the forearms of volunteers, worked into a lather, and rinsed uniformly. The residues were then either photographed or extracted from the skin and quantified spectrophotometrically. Both photographic aand spectroscopic methods demonstrated that there are significant differences in rinsabilities among the products tested. Deodorant bars, regardless ofcomposition, rinsed poorly. Facial bars and "mild bars " tend to have superior finsabilities...|$|E
40|$|Various {{clinical}} procedures {{exist for}} determining the mildness of personal washing products. It is common to use several of these evaluation methods {{in the development of}} a safety-and-claim support package. The utility of many of the methods is limited by their susceptibility to fluctuations in weather conditions. In this paper we describe amethod, the flex wash test, which is not affected by changes in weather and can be used as a highly reproducible method {{for determining the}} relative irritancy potential of personal washing products. The flex wash test consists of a sixty-second wash, three times daily, of the antecubital fossa (flex area) of the arm. Washing is conducted for five consecutive days or until a moderate rythemic response is elicited. Erythema is assessed prior to each wash and four hours after the last daily wash. Twelve commer-cially available personal washing bars were evaluated in this study. The flex wash is a reproducible clinical test that distinguishes differences in the relative irritancy potential of various <b>syndet</b> (synthetic detergent) and soap bars and is independent of ambient weather conditions...|$|E
40|$|Sodium cocoyl isethionate (SCI) {{has been}} a {{predominant}} ingredient in <b>syndet</b> bar formulation for more than thirty years. Although cost effective and well recognized for good skin compatibility, SCI is not regularly found in liquid detergent systems due to its limited solubility in water. This study focuses on the under-standing of enthalpy of solubilization, equilibrium of solubilization, and the structures and properties of sodium cocoyl isethionate and various surfactants. The purpose of this exercise {{is to help the}} formulator to find appropriate surfactant systems to keep sodium cocoyl isethionate in aqueous olution. The solubility of SCI in water is unfavorable in terms of enthalpy of solvation. When setting up equilibrium of solubilization, there are three possible phases, and three methods have been developed to prevent SCI from recrystallizing in aqueous olutions. The first focuses on tying CI ions within micelies made of secondary surfactants. The second focuses on the exchange of sodium ions with ammonium ions (and/or triethanola-monium). The third centers on emulsification of SCI and the subsequent change of micelies into emulsified oil drops. A combination of two or three of these methods will enable the formulator to use SCI as the primary surfactant in liquid detersive systems...|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} exaggerated-exposure wash {{techniques}} {{have been used}} to evaluate the mildness of personal cleansing products in lieu of clinical evaluation during normal use. This study compares two exaggerated methods, a forearm wash method and a flex wash method, to home-use studies to determine how well the exaggerated methods approximate ad lib usage. The results indicate that the forearm wash method is a better predictor of product mildness under home-use conditions when soap bars are used. Both exaggerated methods yield similar mildness pictures when <b>syndet</b> bars are used, although the forearm wash method is more discriminating. The flex wash implement (sponge) induces greater damage to the stratum corneum than does the forearm wash implement (towel). However, this does not account for the total damage observed when product is applied in the flex wash method. A significant amount of damage is apparently due to product reaching and interacting with lower layers of the skin once the barrier's integrity has been compromised by the sponge. The results indicate that the forearm and flex wash methods are based on different exposure models, and that the model on which the forearm wash is based is more predictive of actual consumer use conditions than is the model on which the flex wash is based...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBotulinum {{neurotoxins}} type A and E (BoNT/A and BoNT/E) are metalloproteases with {{a unique}} specificity for SNAP- 25 (synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa), an essential protein component of the neuroexocytotic machinery. It {{has been suggested that}} this specificity is directed through the recognition of a nine residue sequence, termed SNARE motif, that is common to the other two SNARE proteins: VAMP (vesicle-associated membrane protein) and syntaxin, the only known substrates of the other six clostridial neurotoxins. Here we analyse the involvement of the four copies of the SNARE motif present in SNAP- 25 in its interaction with BoNT/A and BoNT/E by following the kinetics of proteolysis of SNAP- 25 mutants deleted of SNARE motifs. We show that a single copy of the motif is sufficient for BoNT/A and BoNT/E to recognise SNAP- 25. While the copy of the motif proximal to the cleavage site is clearly involved in recognition, in its absence, other more distant copies of the motif are able to support proteolysis. Also, a non-neuronal isoform of SNAP- 25, <b>Syndet,</b> is shown to be sensitive to BoNT/E, but not BoNT/A, whilst the SNAP- 25 isoforms from Torpedo marmorata and Drosophila melanogaster were demonstrated not to be substrates of these metalloproteases...|$|E
40|$|We {{used the}} cDNA {{microarray}} technique to monitor simultaneously possible changes induced by hypergravity in the expression level {{of thousands of}} hippocampal genes. We tested the mRNA level of about 5000 genes in the hippocampus of mice subjected to 1. 09 g (1 g) or to 1. 85 g (2 g) for five repeated 1 -h daily rotations in a centrifuge (g = 9. 81 m/s(2)). Data were compared with those obtained for mice kept stationary (C). The ratios 1 g/C and 2 g/C identified genes affected by rotation and rotation + hypergravity, respectively, whereas 2 g/ 1 g ratio identified those affected by hypergravity. We found that about 200 genes were affected by rotation and/or rotation + hypergravity. Almost all the genes affected by rotation + hypergravity were up-regulated, only five being down-regulated. The modulated genes code for proteins involved {{in a wide range}} of cellular functions (DNA/RNA metabolism, protein processing, intermediate metabolism, cytoskeleton and motility, cell cycle and apoptosis, signal transduction, neuronal structure/function), suggesting that rotation + hypergravity may affect several aspects of the hippocampal function in order to compensate for environmental changes. Six genes directly or indirectly involved in synaptic transmission and plasticity (proSAAS, neuroblastoma ras oncogene, ESTs moderately similar to thymosin beta- 10, <b>syndet,</b> inhibin beta E and Ngfi-A binding protein 2) were found to be significantly modulated by hypergravity and unaffected or only slightly affected by rotation. The modulation by hypergravity of these genes suggests that this stimulus might induce plastic remodelling of the hippocampal circuits, possibly both at structural and functional level...|$|E
30|$|The {{classification}} and labelling {{of personal}} care products was derived by application of the criteria given in the CLP Regulation. Bridging principles were not relevant as no information about comparable cosmetic products tested and classified as mixtures was available. 41 cosmetic products were selected {{from a wide range}} of product groups (e.g. [27, 28]): baby skin product (2), after shave (2), shaving cream, deodorant (4), toothpaste (2), shampoo (2), hand and body lotion, shower gel, liquid soap and <b>syndet,</b> eye zone cream, massage oil, carotene skincare gel, all purpose cream, basic cream, hand cream, emulsion with panthenol, massage oil, hair spray (2), oxidative hair dye formula, bleaching lotion, depilatory cream, cold wave solution, mascara (2), lipstick (2), face make up remover, nail glue, perfume, alcohol free cologne, insect repellent (2). The number of ingredients ranged from 41 (perfume) to a single one (nail glue). The formulas are basic recipes for standard products and correspond to lists of ingredients of products in German retail shops and cosmetic frame formulations [8]. The present selection of products is meant to illustrate the situation with some examples and it is not meant to be complete nor representative. The information on properties necessary for {{classification and labelling}} of all ingredients were compiled from data accessible to the general public. Preferentially harmonized classifications were used in the current C&L Inventory [9]. The classifications of substances registered according to REACH were compared with the classifications in the C&L Inventory. Most substances which are used more or less exclusively in cosmetics have not been registered according to REACH, whereas cosmetic ingredients used also in other applications like e.g. glycerol, hydrogen peroxide, isododecane, isopropanol, or phosphoric acid are registered. The recently installed cosmetic products notification portal according to the Cosmetics Regulation 1223 / 2009 [6] is not open for the general public and could not be used. The names used here are the INCI names [29].|$|E
