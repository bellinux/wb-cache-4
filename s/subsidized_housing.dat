5|$|The HAT under Rajoelina's {{leadership}} affected highly visible, concrete {{activities that}} appealed to popular concerns. Rajoelina occasionally organized events to distribute basic items to groups of poor recipients, including medicines, clothing, house maintenance materials and school supplies. Rajoelina's administration also spent billions of ariary to subsidize basic needs like electricity, petrol, and food staples. Public works construction projects featured prominently among Rajoelina's activities. In 2010, two years after Rajoelina launched the project as mayor of Antananarivo, the HAT completed {{the reconstruction of the}} Hotel de Ville (town hall) of Antananarivo which had been destroyed by arson during the rotaka political protests of 1972. Also in 2010, Rajoelina oversaw the construction of a hospital built to international standards in Toamasina. Through its trano mora ("cheap house") initiative, the HAT built several <b>subsidized</b> <b>housing</b> developments intended for young middle class couples. Numerous other construction projects were planned or completed, including the restoration of historic staircases in Antananarivo built in the 19th century during the reign of Queen Ranavalona I, renovation of Toamasina's two main markets and its principal boulevard, repaving of the heavily traveled road between Toamasina and Foulpointe, and the construction of a 15,000-capacity municipal stadium and new town hall in Toamasina.|$|E

25|$|There is no {{consensus}} on the net impact of immigration to government finances. A 1990 study found that an average immigrant household paid $22,528 in all forms of taxes and on average each household directly consumed $10,558 in government services. By contrast an average native Canadian household paid $20,259 in tax and consumed $10,102 dollars in services. Across the country this means that immigrant households contributed $2.6 billion more than their share to the public purse. A 1996 study found that over a lifetime a typical immigrant family will pay some forty thousand dollars more to the treasury than they will consume in services. Explanations for this include that immigrant households tend to be larger, and have more wage earners, increasing taxes. Newcomers are also less likely {{to make use of}} many social services. Immigrants are less likely than native Canadians to receive employment insurance, social assistance, and <b>subsidized</b> <b>housing.</b> Immigrants are also much less likely to become homeless or suffer from mental illness. Recent immigrants are also less likely to make use of <b>subsidized</b> <b>housing</b> than native Canadians of the same income level. In 2004 22.5% of low-income native Canadians lived in <b>subsidized</b> <b>housing,</b> but only 20.4% of low income recent immigrants did so, though this number was considerably higher among more established immigrants. Results from a study from the Fraser Institute found that the immigrants who arrived between 1987 and 2004 cost governments $23 billion per annum (as of 2006) in excess of taxes raised from those immigrants, relating to universal social services (e.g., welfare, medicare, public education).|$|E

40|$|The U. S. tax {{structure}} implicitly <b>subsidizes</b> <b>housing</b> in {{a number}} of ways. This Abstract article employs a dynamic general equilibrium model of housing, consumption and economic growth to examine the long-run effects of eliminating these implicit subsidies on capital accumulation and welfare. It also investigates the relationship between optimal tax rates on residential and nonresidential capital. It is shown that the elimination of housing subsidies in full may increase nonresidential capital by as much as 46 %. while the stock of housing is reduced by over 15 %. In the meantime, per capita consumption goes up by 7 %. In welfare terms, these changes are equivalent to an increase of over 6 % in a representative individual’s lifetime income under the present tax rules. Second, it is found that optimality, from the standpoint of steady state welfare maximization, implies unequal tax treatment of residential and nonresidential capital.

25|$|The {{effects of}} such high incarceration rates are also shown in other ways. For example, {{a woman who has}} been {{recently}} released from prison is ineligible for welfare in most states. She is not eligible for <b>subsidized</b> <b>housing,</b> and for Section 8 she has to wait two years before she can apply. In addition to finding housing, she also has to find employment, but most likely she can not find a job because she has a criminal record so no one wants to hire her. Essentially, a woman who has been recently released from prison comes into a society that is not prepared structurally or emotionally to welcome her back.|$|E

25|$|The Jacksonville Housing Authority (JHA) is the quasi-independent agency {{responsible}} for public housing and <b>subsidized</b> <b>housing</b> in Jacksonville. The Mayor and City Council of Jacksonville established the JHA in 1994 to create an effective, community service oriented, public housing agency with innovative ideas and a different attitude. The primary goal was to provide safe, clean, affordable housing for eligible low and moderate income families, the elderly, and persons with disabilities. The secondary goal was to provide effective social services, work with residents to improve their quality of life, encourage employment and self-sufficiency, and help residents move out of assisted housing. To that end, JHA works with HabiJax to help low and moderate income families to escape the public housing cycle and become successful, productive, homeowners and taxpayers.|$|E

In the 1990s the University of Illinois at Chicago began to expand south of Roosevelt Road, into the Maxwell Street area.

25|$|Concurrent {{with plans}} to build the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial during the 1930s were plans to provide low-rent or <b>subsidized</b> <b>housing</b> to the poor in the city. The {{majority}} of the city's infant mortality and tuberculosis cases originated {{in a set of}} small neighborhoods, and to rectify these problems, the city built two housing projects between 1939 and 1942. The first, Carr Square Village, was built on the near north side of the city, while the second, Clinton-Peabody Terrace, was built near City Hospital, with a combined cost of $7 million for slightly more than 1,300 units. Despite these two projects and the efforts at civic improvement starting in the 1920s, after World War II more than 33,000 houses in St. Louis had shared or outdoor toilets, while thousands lived in cramped, squalid conditions.|$|E

40|$|Three government-sponsored {{enterprises}} (GSEs) -Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Bank System-were {{created to}} improve the availability of home mortgage financing by supplementing local funding. But today's more evolved financial markets enable retail lenders to tap national markets. Thus, the main contribution of the three housing GSEs has become providing homebuyers an interest rate subsidy that is {{made possible by the}} GSEs' special relationship with the federal government.; This article examines the economic issues arising from the provision of such subsidies via the housing GSEs. The authors first review the benefits and costs of <b>subsidizing</b> <b>housing</b> finance and then provide background information about the housing GSEs and their relationship to the federal government. The GSEs' importance to the financial markets, coupled with their special relationship with the government, raises concerns about the potential for moral hazard and the problems that would arise if a housing GSE became financially distressed or insolvent.; The discussion then focuses on two public policy debates that have been sparked by this special relationship. The first is whether the housing GSEs are efficient mechanisms for <b>subsidizing</b> <b>housing.</b> The second relates to the housing GSEs' safety and soundness and questions whether implicit guarantees of their liabilities are the best way to subsidize them.

40|$|The {{potential}} redistributive role of {{the housing}} subsidies has got a relatively little attention in the literature.

In addition to a general four-type model, we also considered two extensions: endogenously determined housing prices and paternalistic government. The key lesson from the paper is that when individuals differ also in access to housing, the housing subsidy schemes have a redistributive role and they are non-linear. A justification for <b>subsidizing</b> or taxing <b>housing</b> holds also without introducing any merit good argument to the analysis; in the optimal tax model where agents di¤er in their abilities and access to housing it is optimal to tax and <b>subsidize</b> <b>housing,</b> even with separable preferences...|$|R
