25|$|Although any {{programming}} language {{can be used}} on the server to process a form's data, the most commonly used languages are scripting languages, which tend to have stronger <b>string</b> <b>handling</b> functionality than {{programming language}}s such as C, and also have automatic memory management which helps to prevent buffer overrun attacks.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of the ZX81 {{highlighted}} the great {{value for money}} offered by the machine but noted its technical shortcomings. As Tim Hartnell put it in Your Computer, [...] "the ZX81 is both a delight and a disappointment". He applauded the improvements {{that had been made}} over the ZX80, such as a much better manual, display and <b>string</b> <b>handling,</b> and called the ZX81 [...] "a very good first computer" [...] that [...] "will open the world of computing to many who would be denied access to it by cost." [...] However, the built-in memory was so small that use of a memory expansion pack was [...] "mandatory for any worthwhile use". He also found the ZX81 to be alarmingly unreliable, having to have his first two test machines replaced before getting one that worked properly.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{the initial}} {{versions}} of C++ {{had only the}} [...] "low-level" [...] C <b>string</b> <b>handling</b> functionality and conventions, multiple incompatible designs for <b>string</b> <b>handling</b> classes have been designed over the years, and C++ programmers may need to handle multiple conventions in a single application.|$|E
50|$|Microsoft RPC (Microsoft Remote Procedure Call) is a {{modified}} version of DCE/RPC. Additions include partial support for UCS-2 (but not Unicode) <b>strings,</b> implicit <b>handles,</b> and complex calculations in the variable-length string and structure paradigms already present in DCE/RPC.|$|R
5000|$|Internally {{a single}} [...] "string" [...] of the FYQ-93 system {{included}} one Hughes H5118ME Central Computer and two Hughes HMP-1116 Peripheral computers. Radar data was input and buffered in one 1116 for orderly {{transfer to the}} 5118, which then constructed the [...] "air picture". The second 1116 on the <b>string</b> <b>handled</b> program loading, console commands, and data storage. The output of the string fed another 1116 called a [...] "Display Controller" [...] (DC), which sent data to and received switch actions from the HMD-22 consoles. Typically there were two strings and two DCs processing in parallel, one on standby {{in case of a}} malfunction in its counterpart. Either string could feed either DC for further equipment reliability.|$|R

50|$|PL/I's main domains are data processing, {{numerical}} computation, scientific computing, {{and system}} programming; it supports recursion, structured programming, linked data structure handling, fixed-point, floating-point, complex, character <b>string</b> <b>handling,</b> and bit <b>string</b> <b>handling.</b> The language syntax is English-like and suited for describing complex data formats, {{with a wide}} set of functions available to verify and manipulate them.|$|E

5000|$|The Pandorian {{animals will}} be brought to life through {{large-scale}} puppetry. Toruk itself is a 'reverse <b>string</b> puppet' (<b>handled</b> from the base) while the Austrapede, Turtapede and Direhorse are 'lived-in puppets' (someone is inside) and the Viperwolf is an 'in-view puppet' (the lower half of the puppeteer is outside, becoming a part of the puppet, while his/her upper body is inside the puppet).|$|R
50|$|JavaScript {{implementations}} may use UCS-2 or UTF-16. As of ES2015, string {{methods and}} regular expression flags {{have been added}} to the language that permit <b>handling</b> <b>strings</b> from an encoding-agnostic perspective.|$|R
50|$|Strings can be {{concatenated}} {{by using}} the '+' operator, rather than using functions. For dedicated <b>string</b> types Delphi <b>handles</b> memory management without programmer intervention. Since Borland Developer Studio 2006 there are functions to locate memory leaks.|$|R

50|$|As {{a general}} rule, the {{framework}} makes as much use as possible of the Standard Template Library, avoiding duplication {{of work on}} things like container classes, or <b>string</b> <b>handling.</b>|$|E
50|$|The PL/I {{language}} provides {{full support}} for pointers to all data types (including pointers to structures), recursion, multitasking, <b>string</b> <b>handling,</b> and extensive built-in functions. PL/I {{was quite a}} leap forward compared to the programming languages of its time.|$|E
50|$|String interning also reduces memory usage {{if there}} are many {{instances}} of the same string value; for instance, it is read from a network or from storage. Such strings may include magic numbers or network protocol information. For example, XML parsers may intern names of tags and attributes to save memory. Network transfer of objects over Java RMI serialization object streams can transfer strings that are interned more efficiently, as the <b>String</b> object's <b>handle</b> is used in place of duplicate objects upon serialization.|$|R
5000|$|HyperTalk is a weakly typed language. All variables, {{and in fact}} all {{values of}} any kind, are stored as typeless {{character}} <b>strings</b> <b>handled</b> by the interpreter as numbers or text based purely on context. This has a cost in speed. Variables need not be declared, but rather are created on the fly as they are required. For example, the following expression creates a variable named , and sets its initial value: [...] Then the expression [...] {{would result in the}} string [...] being stored in that variable. Taking this further, a powerful and intuitive structure known as [...] "chunking" [...] allows precise manipulation of text and number strings. It is possible, for example, to have the second character of the value [...] (the 2) added to the last character of the value , yielding [...] For another example, word 3 of [...] (cruel) can be appended after the first word of , yielding [...] It would then be possible to put [...] into the first word of that string, replacing the current value of that word to yield.

50|$|A later {{derivative}} of TELCOMP called STRINGCOMP was oriented towards <b>string</b> <b>handling.</b> Another BBN JOSS-derivative called FILECOMP {{was developed for}} the GE MEDINET system, which was cancelled.

50|$|The C++ {{programming}} language has support for <b>string</b> <b>handling,</b> mostly implemented in its standard library.

50|$|It {{was one of}} {{the three}} {{variants}} of JOSS II (along with TELCOMP and FILECOMP) that were developed by BBN.

50|$|Mounted {{inside a}} pull switch, {{there could be}} two types of two-position toggle switches. (In both cases the stable {{physical}} open- or closed -situation would be switch in outer and string in upper position.) One type would switch to closed (alternatively open) already during the initial pull in the string. The other type would switch to closed (or open) only when releasing after a full pull. With the first type, {{the weight of the}} <b>string</b> and <b>handle</b> could accidentally switch the load intermittently on and off, when still around the initial position (depending on the internal spring). This could potentially increase the danger of overheating in the switch.|$|R
