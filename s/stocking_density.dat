5|$|Some {{species of}} mysids {{are easy to}} culture {{on a large scale}} in the {{laboratory}} as they are highly adaptive, and can tolerate a wide range of conditions. Despite low fecundity, these species have a short reproductive cycle which means they can quickly reproduce in vast numbers. They can be cultured in static or flow-through systems, the latter having been shown to be able to maintain a higher <b>stocking</b> <b>density</b> than a static system. In flow-through systems, juvenile mysids are continuously separated from the adult brood stock in order to reduce mortality due to cannibalism. Artemia (brine shrimp) juveniles (incubated for 24 hours) are the most common food in mysid cultures, sometimes enriched with highly unsaturated fatty acids to increase their nutritional value.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAbstractKey messageCarbon <b>stock</b> <b>density</b> {{was quite}} similar in planted vs natural forest of Masson’s pine (Pinus massonianaLamb.) in China across three ages (7, 15, and 50  years). The {{stock in the}} {{standing}} trees was larger in planted than in natural forests, but this difference was compensated by larger stocks in the soil and the debris of natural forests. ContextMost studies on the carbon stocks are focused on management strategies to maximize carbon stocks. We still lack data comparing planted vs natural conifer forests. AimsWe compared carbon storage in the different compartment (vegetation, soil, debris) along a chronosequence of Masson’s pine plantations vs natural forests. MethodsWe investigated 58 Masson’s pine (Pinus massoniana Lamb.) forest stands (20  m[*]×[*] 50  m plots), that differ in stand management (planted and natural forests) and age (young, middle-aged, and mature ages) and then calculated the carbon <b>stock</b> <b>densities</b> of vegetation biomass (tree, shrub, and herb), debris, and soil. ResultsThe carbon <b>stock</b> <b>densities</b> in the planted and natural Masson’s pine forest ecosystems ranged from 78 to 210  Mg ha− 1 and from 97 to 177  Mg ha− 1 respectively. The carbon <b>stock</b> <b>densities</b> in the vegetation were significantly greater in planted forests than in natural forests. A lower carbon <b>stock</b> <b>density</b> in debris and soil alleviated the increase of biomass carbon <b>stock</b> <b>densities</b> in planted vs natural forests, leading to similar carbon <b>stock</b> <b>densities</b> at ecosystem level. The carbon <b>stock</b> <b>densities</b> in the vegetation increased with age, whereas those of debris and soil remained stable. ConclusionsPlanted forests of Masson’s pine sequester similiar amounts of carbon at ecosystem level to those in natural forests, reinforcing the idea that planted pine forests {{can contribute to the}} mitigation of greenhouse gas emission...|$|R
25|$|Within {{the same}} snail {{population}} {{and under the}} same conditions, some snails will grow faster than others. Some will take twice as long to mature.

However, a snail farmer should obviously select and keep the largest and fastest maturing snails for breeding stock and sell the smaller snails. By selecting only the largest, the average size of the snail may increase significantly in {{only a couple of}} generations.

2500|$|<b>Stocking</b> <b>density</b> {{refers to}} the number of animals within a {{specified}} area. When <b>stocking</b> <b>density</b> reaches high levels, the behavioural needs of the animals may not be met. [...] This can negatively influence health, welfare and production performance.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Stocking</b> <b>density</b> is {{an issue}} in the welfare of {{commercial}} turkeys and high densities are a major animal welfare concern. [...] Permitted stocking densities for turkeys reared indoors vary according to geography and animal welfare farm assurance schemes. [...] For example, in Germany, there is a voluntary maximum of 52kg/m2 and 58kg/m2 for males and females respectively. [...] In the UK, the RSPCA Freedom Foods assurance scheme reduces permissible <b>stocking</b> <b>density</b> to 25kg/m2 for turkeys reared indoors. [...] Turkeys maintained at commercial stocking densities (8 birds/m2; 61kg/m2) exhibit increased welfare problems such as increases in gait abnormalities, hip and foot lesions, and bird disturbances, and decreased bodyweight compared with lower stocking densities. [...] Turkeys reared at 8 birds/m2 have a higher incidence of hip lesions and foot pad dermatitis than those reared at 6.5 or 5.0 birds/m2. [...] Insufficient space may lead to an increased risk for injuries such as broken wings caused by hitting the pen walls or other turkeys during aggressive encounters and can also lead to heat stress. The problems of small space allowance are exacerbated by the major influence of social facilitation on the behaviour of turkeys. If turkeys are to feed, drink, dust-bathe, etc., simultaneously, then to avoid causing frustration, resources and space must be available in large quantities.|$|E

2500|$|Stereotypies are repetitive, {{sometimes}} abnormal behaviors like pacing on the perch for birds. There are adaptive stereotypic {{behaviors such}} as grooming in cats and preening in birds. Captive parrots commonly perform a range of stereotypies. These behaviors are repeated identically and lack any function or goal. Captive parrots perform striking oral and locomotor stereotypies like pacing on the perch or repetitive play with a certain toy. Feather picking and loud vocalizations can be stereotypies but are not as rigid and may be reactions to confinement, stress, boredom and loneliness {{as studies have shown}} that parrots that are in cages closest to the door are the most prone to feather pick or scream. Feather picking is not a true stereotypy and is more like hair pulling in human and loud vocalizations or screaming can be a stereotypy but vocalization is part of a parrot's natural behavior. [...] Captive parrots lack sufficient stimulation. Presumably they suffer from lack of companionship and opportunities to forage. [...] Stereotypies can evolve from the social environment for example {{the presence or absence of}} certain social stimuli, social isolation, low feeder space and high <b>stocking</b> <b>density</b> (especially for tail biting in pigs).

40|$|Semi-natural grasslands are an {{important}} habitat for endangered plant and animal species. In grasslands, low-intensity livestock grazing is frequently applied {{as a tool for}} nature conservation. We aim to investigate how different livestock species in various densities influence the state and flower production of a single plant species by selective defoliation and/or trampling. We hypothesized that (1) moderate <b>stocking</b> <b>densities</b> would cause more damage than low, and that (2) horses would cause more damage than cattle due to their higher activity. The experiment took place in a salt marsh in the Netherlands where grazing treatments with horses and cattle in two <b>stocking</b> <b>densities</b> were installed. Damage to individual Aster tripolium plants and number of flower heads were recorded {{at the end of the}} grazing season in late September. We found (1) more damage and fewer flower heads in moderate <b>stocking</b> <b>densities</b> compared to low densities. However, a reduction of flower heads by higher <b>stocking</b> <b>densities</b> was less clear with cattle. No clear difference (2) between livestock species was found, due to opposite trends in moderate and low <b>densities.</b> At low <b>stocking</b> <b>densities,</b> cattle caused more damage by selective defoliation. At moderate densities, horses caused more damage, because of their higher mobility, which led to damage by trampling. We conclude that the response of Aster to grazing is strongly affected by behavioral differences between livestock species. Grazing experiments and management schemes for semi-natural grasslands should therefore not only consider <b>stocking</b> <b>densities,</b> but also livestock species to reach desired conservation goals. ...|$|R

40|$|The Borana {{people are}} the {{predominant}} ethnic group on the Borana Plateau in southern Ethiopia. Though traditionally transhumant pastoralists, they have recently increased their reliance on crops. Rainfall in the region averages between 353 mm to 873 mm; variability in rainfall is quite high, with coefficients of variation ranging from. 21 to. 68. The past decade has witnessed {{a dramatic increase in}} land allocated to crops, and land in pastures that are either becoming privatised, or accessible to only a small sub-group of people. In this paper, we derive an empirical model of stocking rates and land allocation, which is then used to estimate the effects of exogenous parameters on <b>stocking</b> <b>densities,</b> land allocated to crops, and land allocated to private pastures. Results indicate the following: a) regions with high coefficients of variation in rainfall have lower livestock densities and less land allocated to crops, b) communities with greater numbers of households and higher population densities have larger indices of non-cooperation, higher <b>stock</b> <b>densities,</b> and more land allocated to crops, c) heterogeneity within a community, measured by the distribution of wealth levels, is positively related to an index of non-cooperation, and to higher <b>stock</b> <b>densities,</b> d) higher relative prices of livestock and shorter distances to market are associated with greater <b>stock</b> <b>densities</b> as well as greater land allocated to crops, e) the greater is mobility into an area, the higher are <b>stock</b> <b>densities,</b> and the lower is the cooperation level, whereas outward mobility by community members has no effect on either <b>stock</b> <b>densities</b> or the level of cooperation reached, f) the proportion of members engaged in wage work outside has a significant negative effect on the ability of the community to cooperate.

This study found that the proportion of annual N inputs lost by denitrification were significantly lower and leaching N losses were higher at high <b>stocking</b> <b>densities</b> compared to if excreta was distributed uniformly.
