50|$|Corwin {{is remembered}} chiefly as an orator. His speeches both <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> and in debate were {{examples}} of remarkable eloquence.|$|R
50|$|If the bails {{have been}} removed from <b>the</b> <b>stumps,</b> a batsman is only out if the fielder pulls a <b>stump</b> out of <b>the</b> ground with the hand holding the ball. If one bail is still <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stumps</b> <b>the</b> fielder is allowed to knock the bail off to claim a run out.|$|R
50|$|Since {{many of the}} Meanies {{were also}} the senior {{engineers}} interacting with developers at the Worldwide Developers Conference (especially <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stump</b> <b>the</b> Experts panel), MacHack, and in other venues, the group came to be well known by its nickname.|$|R

6000|$|... "And so you shall, my pretty," [...] said Steadfast, {{sitting down}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> of a tree, and taking {{her on his}} knee, while Toby nuzzled up to them.|$|R
50|$|Adventitious buds form <b>on</b> roots near <b>the</b> ground surface, <b>on</b> damaged stems (as <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stumps</b> of cut trees), or on old roots. These {{develop into}} {{above-ground}} stems and leaves.|$|R

60|$|James Walsham had not {{accompanied}} the column, and {{was sitting at}} breakfast with General Johnson, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> of a tree {{in front of his}} tent, when, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> still air, a rattling sound broke out.|$|R
40|$|The {{technique}} presented uses a frame-type socket for fixation of <b>the</b> prosthesis <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump.</b> Apart from rigid {{areas for}} stabilization and control, {{the soft tissue}} of <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> is enclosed by flexible material. This allows self-adjustment of the socket to changes in stump circumference and volume, while maintaining good socket fit...|$|R
6000|$|The {{church bells}} were ringing, the devil sat singing [...] <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> of a rotting old tree; 'Oh faith it grows cold, and the creeds they grow old, [...] And {{the world is}} nigh ready for me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nan is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump.</b> Now {{we shall}} catch it,' cried Tom, putting up an {{umbrella}} to shield his unhappy head; for Nan's earnest voice was audible, and her indignant eye happened {{to rest on}} him as she spoke.|$|R
60|$|They {{brought a}} quarter of a saddle to Colonel Clark, but he smiled at them kindly and told them to divide it amongst the weak. He looked at me as I sat with my feet crossed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm {{only the}} {{intelligent}} spectator, {{you ought to}} know that by this time, Hughie. But I thought it might interest you, since you'll have to go <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> and refute it all. That'll be a nice job. So long." ...|$|R
500|$|As {{the crowd}} departs, <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> starts cackling {{and makes the}} charlatan confess. <b>The</b> <b>stump</b> cackles again, {{demanding}} the king never hurt a wizard again, and build a statue of Babbitty <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> {{to remind him of}} his foolishness. The king agrees and heads back to the palace. Afterwards, a [...] "stout old rabbit" [...] with a wand in its teeth hops out from a hole beneath <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> and leaves <b>the</b> kingdom.|$|R
50|$|The {{buildings}} are now almost completely destroyed, {{apart from the}} manor farm, the precinct wall and a dovecote. A fragment of vaulting, possibly from a passageway in the cloister, survives in Chepstow Priory Church, displayed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> of its crossing tower.|$|R
60|$|I sat <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> of a tree, {{and buried}} {{my face in}} my hands. I must have fallen asleep, for, when I raised my eyes again, the day was brighter. Its cheerlessness had gone. The sky was blue, and birds were singing.|$|R
25|$|An {{incident}} in the second Test of the 1960â€“61 series involved the West Indies player Joe Solomon being given out after his hat fell <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stumps</b> after being bowled at by Richie Benaud. The crowd sided with the West Indies over the Australians.|$|R
6000|$|Now {{this made}} Sammy feel very proud and very happy. You {{know it is}} very seldom that he hears {{anything}} nice said of him. He flew down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> {{of one of the}} trees Paddy had cut. [...] "Let's be friends," [...] said he.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is a {{good deal}} in that man Talcott. Of course he's just beginning, but you'll hear from him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump.</b> He is an orator that reaches people. He has the {{advantage}} of most of us; he's in dead earnest when he's advocating Republicanism." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yuh, {{might be}} good idea, all right. Well--Shame I haven't seen more of you, recent years. Oh, say, hope you haven't held it against me, my bucking you as mayor, going <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> for Prout. You see, I'm an {{organization}} Republican, and I kind of felt--" ...|$|R
60|$|Be this as it may, Will Osten and Larry O'Hale, Muggins, and Old Peter, {{continued}} to {{wander through the}} forest, after discovering that they were lost, until the increasing darkness rendered further progress impossible; then they stopped and sat down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump</b> of a fallen tree.|$|R
25|$|If a bowler's {{delivery}} hits <b>the</b> <b>stumps</b> and if {{at least}} one bail is completely removed {{from the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>stumps,</b> <b>the</b> striker (the batsman facing the bowler) is out (assuming the bail does not luckily land back in <b>the</b> <b>stump's</b> spigots). <b>The</b> ball can either have struck <b>the</b> <b>stumps</b> directly, or have been deflected off the bat or body of the batsman. However, the batsman is not bowled out if the ball is touched by a fielder or touched by the wicket-keeper or the umpire before hitting <b>the</b> <b>stumps.</b> <b>The</b> batsman is not out if <b>the</b> bails remain <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stumps.</b>|$|R
50|$|The valley's name may {{originate}} {{from a time}} when a great windstorm felled hundreds of spruce and fir trees on its slopes. These moss-covered stumps resembled graves. Another theory says that extensive logging during the early 1900s left stumps behind. Mosses and lichens grew <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stumps,</b> resembling an overgrown graveyard.|$|R
25|$|It {{was used}} in the game in the 19th Century, where {{trajectory}} was the most important consideration. Lob bowlers, both right and left-handed, sometimes attempted 'donkey drops', pitching <b>the</b> ball <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stumps</b> from as great a height as possible, preferably with the ball descending behind the batsman standing at the crease.|$|R
60|$|The Citizens Union {{began its}} {{campaign}} early that autumn, {{long before the}} Hons. Jonathan Parks and Timothy MacGuire--Republican and Democratic candidates for Mayor--thought of going <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump.</b> For several weeks the meetings were held in the small halls and club rooms of various societies and orders in obscure portions of the city.|$|R
40|$|The {{regeneration}} {{of complex}} structures in adult salamanders depends on mechanisms that offer pointers for regenerative medicine. These include the plasticity of differentiated cells and the retention in regenerative cells of local cues such as positional identity. Limb regeneration proceeds {{by the local}} formation of a blastema, a growth zone of mesenchymal stem cells <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump.</b> <b>The</b> blastema can regenerate autonomously as a self-organizing system over variable linear dimensions. Here we consider the prospects for limb regeneration in mammals from this viewpoint...|$|R
50|$|In 1886, an {{amendment}} {{was added to}} the constitution of the South Carolina Democratic Party that mandated candidates for Governor and Lieutenant Governor to have at least one meeting in every congressional district with the voters. Benjamin Tillman, an upstate demagogue, engaged Governor Richardson at the meetings in 1888 and soundly trounced him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stump.</b>|$|R
