[...] She was {{fingerprinted}} and charged with felonious assault and possession of a deadly weapon. The next morning, the New York Daily News ran a front page headline stating: [...] "Actress Shoots Andy Warhol." [...] Solanas demanded a retraction of the statement {{that she was an}} actress. The Daily News changed the headline in its later edition and added a quote from Solanas stating [...] "I'm a writer, not an actress." [...] At her arraignment in Manhattan Criminal Court she denied shooting Warhol because he wouldn't produce her play but said [...] "it was for the opposite reason", that [...] "he has a legal claim on my works." [...] Solanas told the judge that [...] "it's not often that I shoot somebody. I didn't do it for nothing. Warhol had tied me up, lock, stock, and barrel.

500|$|In a 2010 {{interview}} with Iwata, {{he was surprised}} about the game's reception outside Japan, which retrogamers have named {{it as one of}} their favorite and most memorable 8-bit titles. He said: [...] "It’s kind of funny that the first time I ever really had any sense of the game’s success was about 10 years following the original release of Blaster Master, when a young staff member from the U.S. office said <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like, 'You’d definitely have become a super famous game designer if you were an American.'" [...] Alex Neuse, creator of the Bit.Trip series, reminisced his memories of playing Blaster Master as a child. He acknowledged that the game was a clone of Metroid that featured a tank that could jump and a corny storyline, but he said it was all [...] "presented {{in a way that it}} felt meaningful". He added that the game's music convinced him [...] "that video game music could be high-quality, memorable, and evocative". 1UP.com listed the game as the 11th best NES game of all time in its [...] "Top 25 NES Games" [...] list; the 1UP.com staff said the game was [...] "an action game that worked like a mishmash of every NES game before it", noting the expansive map like in Metroid. Paste magazine ranked Blaster Master as the 2nd greatest NES game of all time, behind The Legend of Zelda; they cited the tank's additional abilities as a main reason behind its ranking.|$|E

2500|$|The Colour and the Shape {{has been}} {{characterized}} as alternative rock, post-grunge, hard rock, and grunge by professional reviewers.

[...] The album's track sequence reflects this sentiment, chronicling his change from chaos to newfound happiness. Although Grohl admitted the lyricism found on Foo Fighters was obscure and [...] "nonsense," [...] Norton pushed Grohl to write lyrics that had meaning. Grohl also found new strength in his singing compared to the insecurities on his voice for the debut, and delved deeper into his feelings with the lyrics, with him stating that [...] "there was a new freedom: 'Wow, I can actually write about things I feel strongly about and things that mean <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and things I wouldn't normally say in everyday conversation.'" [...] The frontman stated that the experience was [...] "kind of liberating," [...] comparing the album to going to a weekly visit to the therapist [...] "and then {{the rest of the week}} feel pretty good about everything." ...|$|E
