5|$|Traditionally, {{living things}} have been divided into five kingdoms: Monera; Protista; Fungi; Plantae; Animalia. However, many <b>scientists</b> <b>now</b> {{consider}} this five-kingdom system outdated. Modern alternative classification systems generally begin with the three-domain system: Archaea (originally Archaebacteria); Bacteria (originally Eubacteria) and Eukaryota (including protists, fungi, plants, and animals) These domains reflect whether the cells have nuclei or not, as well as differences in the chemical composition of key biomolecules such as ribosomes.|$|E
5|$|Originally, this genus was {{believed}} to be a prosauropod because of the knife-shaped teeth found near its fossils, which fit in with the idea that prosauropods were omnivorous. <b>Scientists</b> <b>now</b> know that the teeth belonged to an unidentified theropod that may have scavenged on the Vulcanodon carcass. Vulcanodon is now known to be a true sauropod. Upon the discovery of the related Tazoudasaurus, both animals were unified in the family Vulcanodontidae, though this has not been universally accepted.|$|E

5|$|The {{superorder}} Selachimorpha {{is divided}} into Galea (or Galeomorphii), and Squalea (or Squalomorphii). The Galeans are the Heterodontiformes, Orectolobiformes, Lamniformes, and Carcharhiniformes. Lamnoids and Carcharhinoids are usually placed in one clade, but recent studies show the Lamnoids and Orectoloboids are a clade. Some <b>scientists</b> <b>now</b> think that Heterodontoids may be Squalean. The Squaleans are divided into Hexanchoidei and Squalomorpha. The Hexanchoidei includes the Hexanchiformes and Chlamydoselachiformes. The Squalomorpha contains the Squaliformes and the Hypnosqualea. The Hypnosqualea may be invalid. It includes the Squatiniformes, and the Pristorajea, which may also be invalid, but includes the Pristiophoriformes and the Batoidea.|$|E

25|$|The {{volume of}} {{scientific}} articles authored by Iranians in international journals has augmented considerably since 2005, according to Thomson Reutersâ€™ Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded). Iranian <b>scientists</b> <b>now</b> publish widely in international journals in engineering and chemistry, {{as well as}} in life sciences and physics. Women contribute about 13% of articles, with a focus on chemistry, medical sciences and social sciences. Contributing to this trend is the fact that PhD programmes in Iran now require students to have publications in the Web of Science.|$|E

25|$|Even as {{scientific}} {{knowledge about the}} Mississippi River has grown, upstream development {{and the consequences of}} the levees have caused more severe flooding in some years. <b>Scientists</b> <b>now</b> understand that the widespread clearing of land and building of the levees have changed the nature of the river.

The state and federal governments have been struggling for the best approaches to restore some natural habitats in order to best interact with the original riverine ecology.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{understanding}} of evolution {{began with the}} 1859 publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species. In addition, Gregor Mendel's work with plants helped to explain the hereditary patterns of genetics. Fossil discoveries in paleontology, advances in population genetics and a global network of scientific research have provided further details into the mechanisms of evolution. <b>Scientists</b> <b>now</b> have a good {{understanding of}} the origin of new species (speciation) and have observed the speciation process in the laboratory and in the wild. Evolution is the principal scientific theory that biologists use to understand life and is used in many disciplines, including medicine, psychology, conservation biology, anthropology, forensics, agriculture and other social-cultural applications.|$|E
25|$|Even single neurons have complex biophysical {{characteristics}} and can perform computations (e.g.). Hodgkin and Huxley's original model only employed two voltage-sensitive currents (Voltage sensitive ion channels are glycoprotein molecules which extend through the lipid bilayer, allowing ions to traverse {{under certain conditions}} through the axolemma), the fast-acting sodium and the inward-rectifying potassium. Though successful in predicting the timing and qualitative features of the action potential, it nevertheless failed to predict {{a number of important}} features such as adaptation and shunting. <b>Scientists</b> <b>now</b> believe that there are a wide variety of voltage-sensitive currents, and the implications of the differing dynamics, modulations, and sensitivity of these currents is an important topic of computational neuroscience.|$|E

25|$|The true {{identity}} of the discoverers of carbon nanotubes is a subject of some controversy. A 2006 editorial written by Marc Monthioux and Vladimir Kuznetsov in the journal Carbon described the interesting and often-misstated origin of the carbon nanotube. A large percentage of academic and popular literature attributes the discovery of hollow, nanometer-size tubes composed of graphitic carbon to Sumio Iijima of NEC in 1991. He published a paper describing his discovery which initiated a flurry of excitement and could be credited by inspiring the many <b>scientists</b> <b>now</b> studying applications of carbon nanotubes. Though Iijima has been given {{much of the credit}} for discovering carbon nanotubes, {{it turns out that the}} timeline of carbon nanotubes goes back much further than 1991.|$|E
25|$|The other protein, TAS1R3, {{is present}} and {{identical}} {{to that of other}} animals, and the relevant taste buds are still present but inactive. Such a genetic marker found in the entire family and not other animals must be the result of a mutation in an early ancestor; as a deletion mutation it could not revert, and thus would be inherited by all descendants, as the evolutionary tree branched out. Some <b>scientists</b> <b>now</b> believe this is the root of the cat family's extremely specialized evolutionary niche as a hunter and carnivore. Their modified sense of taste would cause them to some degree to ignore plants, a large part of whose taste appeal derives from their high sugar content, in favor of a high-protein carnivorous diet, which would still stimulate their remaining taste receptors.|$|E
25|$|Another highly {{classified}} U.S. {{study was}} conducted by the CIA's Office of Scientific Investigation (OS/I) {{in the latter half}} of 1952 in response to orders from the National Security Council (NSC). This study concluded UFOs were real physical objects of potential threat to national security. One OS/I memo to the CIA Director (DCI) in December read: the reports of incidents convince us that there is something going on that must have immediate attention... Sightings of unexplained objects at great altitudes and traveling at high speeds in the vicinity of major U.S. defense installations are of such a nature that they are not attributable to natural phenomena or any known types of aerial vehicles. The matter was considered so urgent that OS/I drafted a memorandum from the DCI to the NSC proposing that the NSC establish an investigation of UFOs as a priority project throughout the intelligence and the defense research and development community. It also urged the DCI to establish an external research project of top-level <b>scientists,</b> <b>now</b> known as the Robertson Panel to analyze the problem of UFOs. The OS/I investigation was called off after the Robertson Panel's negative conclusions in January 1953.|$|E

25|$|NASA <b>scientists</b> <b>now</b> {{believe that}} the dark {{material}} is lag (residue) from the sublimation (evaporation) of water ice {{on the surface of}} Iapetus, possibly darkened further upon exposure to sunlight. Because of its slow rotation of 79days (equal to its revolution and the longest in the Saturnian system), Iapetus would have had the warmest daytime surface temperature and coldest nighttime temperature in the Saturnian system even before the development of the color contrast; near the equator, heat absorption by the dark material results in a daytime temperatures of 129K in the dark Cassini Regio compared to 113K in the bright regions. The difference in temperature means that ice preferentially sublimates from Cassini Regio, and deposits in the bright areas and especially at the even colder poles. Over geologic time scales, this would further darken Cassini Regio and brighten the rest of Iapetus, creating a positive feedback thermal runaway process of ever greater contrast in albedo, ending with all exposed ice being lost from Cassini Regio. It is estimated that over a period of one billion years at current temperatures, dark areas of Iapetus would lose about 20 meters of ice to sublimation, while the bright regions would lose only 10 centimeters, not considering the ice transferred from the dark regions. This model explains the distribution of light and dark areas, the absence of shades of grey, and the thinness of the dark material covering Cassini Regio. The redistribution of ice is facilitated by Iapetus's weak gravity, which means that at ambient temperatures a water molecule can migrate from one hemisphere to the other in just a few hops.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck {{believed}} the giraffe's long neck was an [...] "acquired characteristic", developed as generations of ancestral giraffes strove {{to reach the}} leaves of tall trees. This theory was eventually rejected, and <b>scientists</b> <b>now</b> believe the giraffe's neck arose through Darwinian natural selectionâ€”that ancestral giraffes with long necks thereby had a competitive feeding advantage (competing browsers hypothesis) that better enabled them to survive and reproduce to pass on their genes.|$|E
