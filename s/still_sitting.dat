5|$|After Germany's {{defeat in}} {{the war and the}} signing of the Armistice in November 1918, Markgraf and most of the capital ships of the High Seas Fleet were interned by the Royal Navy in Scapa Flow. The ships were {{disarmed}} and reduced to skeleton crews while the Allied powers negotiated {{the final version of the}} Treaty of Versailles. On 21 June 1919, days before the treaty was signed, the commander of the interned fleet, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, ordered the fleet to be scuttled to ensure that the British would not be able to seize the ships. Unlike most of the scuttled ships, Markgraf was never raised for scrapping; the wreck is <b>still</b> <b>sitting</b> on the bottom of the bay.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1941 the mitrailleuse de 25 mm contre-aéroplanes Modèle 1940, a naval {{adaptation}} of an Army anti-aircraft gun, became available. So Volta was modified between August and November 1941 with two single 25mm guns where the Hotchkiss machine guns had been mounted. Their platform was widened and one additional Browning machine gun was added {{on each side of}} the platform. The Hotchkiss guns were moved to the upper deck on either side of the after deck house. A degaussing cable was added during this same refit. Later in the year the SS 6 sonar was scheduled to be replaced by a French copy of the British ASDIC, but it was <b>still</b> <b>sitting</b> on the dockside when Volta was scuttled in Toulon Harbour when the Germans tried to seize the fleet on 27 November 1942 to prevent it from defecting to the Allies. She was raised on 20 May 1943 by the Italians, but no effort was made to repair her. Volta was bombed and sunk on 24 November 1943 and later refloated and scrapped in 1948.|$|E
5|$|When {{the chorus}} of the song begins, two women pull Gaga out of the bathtub, rip her top {{clothing}} off and force her to drink a glass of vodka. As the second verse begins, Gaga, wearing a diamond-covered outfit topped with a crown, seductively dances {{for a group of}} men bidding for her. She straddles one of the men, played by Slovenian model Jurij Bradač, and performs a lap dance for him. Afterwards, the man raises his bid and becomes the highest bidder for her. When the chorus is played for the third time, Gaga is shown wearing a faux-polar bear hide jacket. She walks towards the man, who is sitting on a bed and unbuttoning his shirt, while drinking a glass of vodka. Gaga has a look of indifference on her face and removes her jacket and sunglasses. Suddenly, the bed spontaneously combusts with the man <b>still</b> <b>sitting</b> on it, and Gaga sings in a sinister way in front of the flames. The video ends with her lying beside a smoldering skeleton, on top of the destroyed bed, covered in ashes. With soot smeared across her body, she calmly smokes a cigarette while her pyrotechnic bra activates.|$|E

25|$|Commentators {{have noted}} that Bell v. Cone is {{significant}} because it clarified the standards that should be used when determining ineffective assistance of counsel claims. Other commentators {{have suggested that the}} Court's ruling has made it more difficult for state prisoners to receive habeas relief in federal court. After several additional appeals, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Cone v. Bell (2009) that Cone should receive a new hearing in federal trial court to determine whether the prosecution's failure to disclose evidence violated Cone's rights to due process under Brady v. Maryland. In 2016, Gary Cone died from natural causes while <b>still</b> <b>sitting</b> on Tennessee's death row.|$|E
25|$|William Henry Chase (June 4, 1798– February 8, 1870) was a Florida militia colonel {{during the}} events in early 1861 {{that led to the}} American Civil War (Civil War). On January 15, 1861, on behalf of the State and Governor of Florida, Colonel Chase demanded the {{surrender}} of Fort Pickens at Pensacola, Florida and of its U.S. Army garrison. Chase had designed and constructed the fort while he was a captain in the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Lieutenant Adam J. Slemmer, commander of the fort, refused the surrender demand. An informal truce between the administration of President James Buchanan and Florida officials, including their <b>still</b> <b>sitting</b> U.S. Senators, avoided military action at Pensacola until after the Battle of Fort Sumter in April 1861.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{students}} and professors persuaded others <b>still</b> <b>sitting</b> on the lower tiers of the Monument to get up and leave, while soldiers beat them with clubs and gunbutts and prodded them with bayonets. Witnesses heard bursts of gunfire. At about 5:10 am, {{the students}} began to leave the Monument. They linked hands and marched through a corridor to the southeast, though some departed through the north. Those who refused to leave were beaten by soldiers and ordered to join the departing procession. Having removed the students from the square, soldiers were ordered to relinquish their ammunition, after which they were allowed a short reprieve from 7:00 am to 9:00 am. The soldiers were then ordered to clear the square of all debris left over from the student occupation. The debris was either piled and burnt on the square, or placed in large plastic bags that were then airlifted away by military helicopters. After the cleanup of the square was completed the troops stationed at The Great Hall of the People remained confined within for the next nine days. During this time the soldiers were left to sleep on the floors and fed a single packet of instant noodles split between three men daily. Officers apparently suffered no such deprivation, and were served regular meals apart from their troops.|$|E

25|$|Rey Cometa was {{accompanied}} by Stuka, Jr. for his one-on-one match with Namajague, while his opponent had Okumura at ringside, bringing all four participants in the Homenaje a Dos Leyendas main event back together again. Okumura helped his partner by attacking Rey Cometa before the bell could even ring, giving Namajague the advantage for the first fall, allowing him to pin Cometa after a power bomb. Stuka, Jr. helped Cometa by keeping Okumura at bay during the second fall, even when the two wrestlers fought outside the ring. At one point Rey Cometa was able to leap off the elevated stage, landing a Moonsault assault on Namajague. Once back inside the ring Rey Cometa forced Namajague to submit to an Armbar submission hold. The third fall was the longest of the match as saw both men hold the advantage in the match at different times. After looking like he would lose Rey Cometa was able to outsmart Namajague, allowing him to land a 450° splash so he could pin him to win the match. Following the match Namajague, who had resisted removing his mask during the Dos Leyendas show, accepted the loss and knelt down as Rey Cometa began to cut his hair. After getting a few handfuls of Namajague's black and bleached hair he left the official CMLL barber finish up, shaving all of Namajague's hair off while <b>still</b> <b>sitting</b> {{in the center of}} the ring.|$|E
25|$|Villeneuve {{arrived at}} Fort de France, Martinique on 14 May, and was joined {{over the next}} two days by the Spanish under Gravina. Having resupplied, he settled in to await the arrival of Ganteaume, who unbeknownst to him was <b>still</b> <b>sitting</b> {{blockaded}} in Brest. Initially reluctant to undertake any large scale assaults on the British possessions in the Caribbean without orders, he was finally persuaded by the Governor of Martinique to attack the British held Diamond Rock after two weeks of sitting idle at anchor. The small garrison surrendered on 2 June, by which time the frigate Didon had arrived with orders. Villeneuve was instructed to await the arrival of two extra ships under Rear-Admiral René Magon, and then spend a month attacking and capturing the British colonies in the West Indies. He was then to sail his entire force back to Europe, join Ganteaume at Brest and cover the invasion flotilla. The orders also noted that Nelson had sailed to Egypt in search of him. In fact Nelson was by now only two days away from Barbados, where he would anchor on 4 June. Villeneuve gathered his forces and pressed northwards towards Antigua, but on 7 June he came across a lightly defended convoy of British merchants, and captured several of them the following day. From them he discovered that Nelson had arrived at Barbados. A shocked Villeneuve decided to break off operations and head north and east again, back to Europe. The fleet got underway on 11 June, causing one of the army officers attached to the fleet, General Honoré Charles Reille to note We have been masters of the sea for three weeks with a landing force of 7000 to 8000 men and {{have not been able to}} attack a single island.|$|E

[...] The new courts, with Stoughton <b>still</b> <b>sitting</b> as chief justice, began to handle the witchcraft cases in 1693, but were under specific instructions from Phips to disregard spectral evidence. As a result, {{a significant number of}} cases were dismissed {{due to a lack of}} evidence, and Phips vacated the few convictions that were made. On 3 January 1693 Stoughton ordered the execution of all suspected witches who had been exempted by their pregnancy. Phips denied enforcement of the order. This turn of events angered Stoughton, and he briefly left the bench in protest.|$|E

The body was shown to the Leetes' sister for identification, and a portion of the clothing was sent to his mother in Guilford for further identification, which was inconclusive.

500|$|To the west, the 1903 {{proposed}} extension from Knightsbridge to Hammersmith via Kensington High Street remained, {{but it was}} to [...] continue beyond Hammersmith under King Street, [...] {{the final}} station being at the junction of King Street, Goldhawk Road and Chiswick High Road. The tunnels were to continue beyond the final station for a further [...] under Chiswick High Road, to end at the junction with Homefield Road. The loop north from Hammersmith to Shepherd's Bush was dropped; instead a more direct route to Shepherd's Bush was proposed as a branch from the Hammersmith extension at Addison Road. It was to run under Holland Road to Shepherd's Bush Green, with a station being constructed opposite the CLR station there. It would then continue west under Uxbridge Road to Acton Vale, where a depot was to be built on the surface between Agnes Road and Davis Road. To {{cover the cost of}} the proposed extensions, powers to raise further capital of £4.2 million were sought. The review of the bill in Parliament was delayed as the Royal Commission was <b>still</b> <b>sitting</b> {{during the first half of}} 1905; the bill was withdrawn by the GNP in July 1905, as insufficient time then remained for completion the parliamentary process before the end of the session.|$|E

Vedder noticed the album cover for Johnny [...] "Guitar" [...] Watson's 1979 album, What the Hell Is This?, and imagined a man who becomes attracted to one of the various women on the cover and then wonders why this woman would rather be one of Watson's many girlfriends instead of his only one.
