5|$|Jerry's form {{has been}} impressively {{consistent}} {{over the past}} few seasons, he has maintained excellent fitness levels and will once again be a very valuable player for us next season. He is a very good professional who is always on the training field. That is why his career has lasted as long as it has. Jerry is a very good influence on the dressing room as well and I'm delighted that he will be <b>staying</b> <b>with</b> <b>us.</b>|$|E
500|$|The trip to America is approaching. [...] {{is not yet}} complete. Terrible haste... {{the score}} is only half-ready. The copyist, Mr. Kauppi, is <b>staying</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> and writing night and day... It is only because of Janne's [...] energy that we are making progress... We lit a lamp in the dining room, a {{chandelier}} in the living room, it was a festive moment. I didn't dare say a word. I just checked that the environment was in order. Then I went to bed and Janne stayed up. All night long I could hear his footsteps, alternating with music played quietly.|$|E
500|$|Ahead of the 2007–08 season, Bristol City manager Gary Johnson stated his {{intention}} to send Myrie-Williams out on loan {{in order to gain}} more first-team experience. Johnson believed that Myrie-Williams would only benefit from a loan move to a League One club, given that he was playing in the third tier of English football prior to Bristol City's promotion to the Championship during the 2006–07 campaign. Two days {{before the start of the}} 2007–08 season, Myrie-Williams joined Cheltenham Town on a month's loan. He made his debut for Cheltenham in the club's 1–0 home win against Gillingham on the first day of the season, coming on as a substitute in the 68th minute. Myrie-Williams made a further substitute appearance in a 1–0 defeat at Millwall a week later, before starting his first game in a 1–1 draw with Swindon Town on 25 August 2007. After making four first-team appearances for Cheltenham, Myrie-Williams' loan was extended for a further month, running until 6 October 2007. Cheltenham Town manager John Ward said [...] "I am really pleased that Jennison will be <b>staying</b> <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> In the last two or three games he has started to show his tremendous pace and ability on the ball". His loan was extended yet again in October 2007, taking him into a third month with Cheltenham. He scored his first goal for Cheltenham in a 3–1 away win at Swindon Town in the Football League Trophy, scoring the first goal of the game, [...] "finishing neatly after a superb through ball from Craig Reid". He made his final appearance for Cheltenham in a 2–2 home draw with Crewe Alexandra, coming on as a substitute as Cheltenham scored two late goals to salvage a point. After the game, Myrie-Williams suffered a knee injury in training, ruling him out of first-team action for two weeks. He made 13 appearances for Cheltenham during his three-month loan spell, scoring one goal— he returned to his parent club in early November 2007.|$|E

2500|$|... "It's a shame {{for this}} to happen to Alan," [...] said captain Kim Hughes. [...] "He's no sloucher. I don't think he's ever come off a cricket ground in his life. He will be <b>staying</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> {{throughout}} the fourth Test.... Alan wants to help with other duties in any way he can. That's the sort of person he is... He really struggled for his rhythm and line. He just can't get around. He's very disappointed. He was hopeful he might put up with it and carry on, but it's no use now... He's lost everything. On his form against West Zone you just couldn't play him anymore. He's still got a lot of cricket left in him and he could do himself permanent damage." ...|$|E

You would, however, greatly oblige your mother, and I'm sure I need not add, myself, {{if you could}} make your arrangements so as to <b>stay</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> till after Easter.
