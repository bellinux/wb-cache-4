5|$|In 2010, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) {{rejected}} proposals {{from the}} United States and Palau {{that would have}} required countries to strictly regulate trade in several species of scalloped hammerhead, oceanic whitetip and spiny dogfish sharks. The majority, but not the required two-thirds of voting delegates, approved the proposal. China, by far the world's largest shark market, and Japan, which battles all attempts to extend the convention to marine species, led the opposition. In March 2013, three endangered commercially valuable sharks, the hammerheads, the oceanic whitetip and porbeagle were added to Appendix 2 of CITES, bringing <b>shark</b> <b>fishing</b> and commerce of these species under licensing and regulation.|$|E

25|$|Agriculture was {{introduced}} to the region around 400 AD to the present. Poor soil and the unreliability of rainfall reduced the viability of agriculture as a reliable subsistence pattern. Throughout the course of the occupation of Chibuene, the inhabitants practiced a broad subsistence economy with the utilization of domestic animals, marine fauna, and wild plant life to augment agricultural production. Of particular significance to the site was the distinctive emphasis on marine fauna in the diets of the inhabitants. The 1995 excavations from a Swedish sponsored team revealed a rather high proportion of fish remains in comparison to sites in South Africa. The faunal remains of shark and turtle were notable features of the site. <b>Shark</b> <b>fishing</b> and turtle hunting are subsistence strategies more associated with East African, or Swahili coast, sites beginning in the first millennium, revealing a closer affinity of Chibuene to sites further north than the southern interior.|$|E

INTRODUCTION Sharks World is a simulation of <b>sharks</b> and <b>fish</b> swimming through a two-dimensional toroidal world. When a <b>shark</b> and a <b>fish</b> are within a certain distance, the shark will eat the fish, causing the fish to disappear from the simulation. <b>Sharks</b> and <b>fish</b> do not interact in any other way.

25|$|The broadnose sevengill {{is listed}} by the IUCN Red List as Data Deficient {{throughout}} most of its range, and as possibly Vulnerable in the northeast Pacific and Near Threatened in the eastern Pacific. This species likely suffers great ongoing pressure from various types of fisheries, and from frequently being caught as bycatch. In Argentina, it's fished by rod and reel and broadnose sevengill <b>shark</b> <b>fishing</b> competitions have been occurring since the 1960s. It is also threatened by water pollution and is hunted for its liveroil and hide which is considered good quality {{in places such as}} China. In the early 1980s, intense fishing in the San Francisco Bay caused a local decline. Its meat and fins are in demand in countries such as the USA, Brazil, Spain, Germany, Netherlands and Israel, and is packaged for frozen food. The broadnose sevengill is also a source of vitamin A and utilized by South African sport anglers for winter tournaments, however, this shark is not easy to land despite being readily hooked.|$|E
25|$|After {{returning}} to active duty, Hathcock helped establish the Marine Corps Scout Sniper School, at the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia. Due to his extreme injuries suffered in Vietnam, {{he was in}} nearly constant pain, but he continued to dedicate himself to teaching snipers. In 1975, Hathcock's health began to deteriorate, and {{he was diagnosed with}} multiple sclerosis. He stayed in the Marine Corps, but his health continued to decline. And, just 55 days short of the 20 years that would have made him eligible for regular retirement pay, he received a permanent disability separation. Being medically discharged, he received 100 percent disability pay. He would have received only 50 percent of his final pay grade had he retired after 20 years. He fell into a state of depression when he was forced out of the Marines, because he felt as if the service had kicked him out. During this depression, his wife Jo nearly left him but decided to stay. Hathcock eventually picked up the hobby of <b>shark</b> <b>fishing,</b> which helped him overcome his depression.|$|E
25|$|The {{rainbow runner}} (Elagatis bipinnulata), {{also known as}} the rainbow yellowtail, Spanish jack and Hawaiian salmon, is a common species of pelagic marine fish of the jack family, Carangidae. The species is {{widespread}} throughout the tropical and subtropical waters of the world, inhabiting both coastal as well as far offshore areas. The species is {{the only member of the}} genus Elagatis, which was created 15 years after its initial description, and is closely related to the amberjacks. The rainbow runner is easily distinguished by its body shape, and the brilliant colouration which gives the fish its name. It is a fast swimming predator, taking small fish, cephalopods and a wide variety of planktonic crustaceans. The species reaches sexual maturity at around , and spawning takes place at different times, with some populations spawning year round, while others only spawn at certain times of the year. The species is a well known game fish, taken by a variety of fishing methods and is a well rated table fish. Large amounts of the species are taken as bycatch in tuna and <b>shark</b> <b>fishing</b> operations and marketed.|$|E

500|$|The most {{significant}} longfin mako catches are by Japanese tropical longline fisheries, and those sharks occasionally enter Tokyo markets. From 1987 to 1994, United States fisheries reported catches (discarded, as this species is worthless on the North American market) of 2–12 tons per year. Since 1999, retention {{of this species}} has been prohibited by the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service [...] Fishery Management Plan for Atlantic sharks. Longfin makos were once significant in the Cuban longline fishery, comprising a sixth of the shark landings from 1971 to 1972; more recent data from this fishery are not available. The IUCN has assessed this species as vulnerable due to its uncommonness, low reproductive rate, and susceptibility to <b>shark</b> <b>fishing</b> gear. It has also been listed under Annex I of the Convention on Migratory Species Migratory Shark Memorandum of Understanding. In the North Atlantic, stocks of the shortfin mako have declined 40% or more since the late 1980s, and concerns exist that populations of the longfin mako are following the same trend.|$|E
500|$|The western North Atlantic {{porbeagle}} {{population has}} a more positive prospect than in the eastern North Atlantic. Fishing in Canadian waters was originally regulated by the 1995 Fisheries Management Plan for pelagic sharks in Atlantic Canada, which established an annual quota of 1,500 tons, restricted the time, place, and gear types allowed for commercial fishing, and set limits for bycatch and recreational fishing. In 2000–2001, Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) prepared a detailed population model and concluded that a quota of 200–250 tons would allow for population growth, resulting in a quota of 250 tons being adopted {{for the period of}} 2002–2007. The mating ground off of Newfoundland was also closed to <b>shark</b> <b>fishing.</b> [...] In 2004, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) listed the porbeagle as Endangered, largely {{on the basis of the}} low population abundance (<25% of original numbers). Canada decided not to list the species under its Species At Risk Act, but further reduced the total fishing quota to 185 tons. [...] In US waters, the 1993 Fishery Management Plan for Sharks of the Atlantic Ocean sets an annual quota of 92 tons (post-processing) for the porbeagle. In 2006, this species was listed as a Species of Concern by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), meaning that it merits conservation concern but there is insufficient data for inclusion on the US Endangered Species Act.|$|E

2500|$|While {{a number}} of {{attempts}} at setting up small industrial units on the island have been made, {{the economy of the}} island is largely dependent on tourism. Subventions from Achill people working abroad, in particular in the United Kingdom, the United States and Africa allowed many families to remain living in Achill throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Since the advent of Ireland's [...] "Celtic Tiger" [...] economy fewer Achill people were forced to look for work abroad. Agriculture plays a small role {{and the fact that the}} island is mostly bog means that its potential for agriculture is limited largely to sheep farming. In the past, fishing was a significant activity but this aspect of the economy is small now. At one stage, the island was known for its <b>shark</b> <b>fishing,</b> basking shark in particular was fished for its valuable liver oil. There was a big spurt of growth in tourism in the 1960s and 1970s before which life was tough and difficult on the island. Despite healthy visitor numbers each year, the common perception is that tourism in Achill has been slowly declining since its heyday. Currently, the largest employers on Achill are two hotels.
