40|$|This project aims {{to develop}} a system for {{evaluating}} patient satisfaction with foot surgery. It is {{in collaboration with the}} Uppsala Academic hospital, the main user of it will be the patients and researchers. That means a smooth running system is not enough. We need to consider the human-computer interaction factors associated with helping patients to express their situation as easily and accurately as possible, and help the researchers to obtain intuitive and meaningful results and the main goal of this project is {{to develop a}} survey system on the tablet PC which uses the touch screen to implement survey instruments that have previously been impossible to deliver in a computerized manner. The system provides a way for patients to give their feed back to their doctor easily, and also for researchers to measure, keep and compare results. We will use a <b>slide</b> <b>tool</b> bar in the GUI to help the patient to express their status accurately and intuitively. Feedback to researchers includes numerical representations of patient feedback measure the effects as well. The survey results will be stored in a Database system, compare to the traditional way, it will perform better in results management and querying. This report describes how we design and develop this survey system, and how we make it as usable as possible. The project is based on Windows. The main program and GUI for the patient is developed in Java. The Database for storing the result is based on the MySQL system. The interface for the researchers to query and compare the results is developed in J 2 EE. The project was divided into several development phases (called "sprints" in the Agile development terminology). Each sprint lasted 1 - 3 weeks (depending on the subtask to be colmeted). Each sprint focuses on a specific use case, and the documentation is also included in the sprint...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} slide-bending {{formation of}} thin metal sheet {{by using an}} industrial robot. The formation of parts made of very thin sheets has become increasingly important following the miniaturization of industrial products, including electrical and mechanical devices. The thinning of sheet thickness causes several problems on the formability and accuracy of the products. in order to solve such problems in bending, a new process where a foil work-piece was bent by a <b>sliding</b> <b>tool</b> was proposed. The method was called a slide bending formation and the bending formation of metal foil with 0. 0 lmm- 0. 05 mn thickness was bent by a <b>sliding</b> <b>tool.</b> Various bent products with complex shapes could be formed easily and precisely under optimum conditions using this method...|$|R
40|$|The {{acquisition}} of high-resolution surface information by advanced documentation methods as short-range laser scanning or closerange photogrammetry can provide novel tool mark research perspectives {{in the field}} of archaeological sciences. For this reason, altogether eight different Bronze Age hand tool replicas and their tool marks were surveyed and analysed in this study. The automatic identification of <b>sliding</b> <b>tool</b> marks was carried out in a GIS environment. Based on hydrological and aspect parameters, the various hand tool impressions as watershed boundaries of the surface model could be determined in the developed workflow. After the segmentation of the single tool marks, slope and width values of the patterns were compared with the cutting edges of their replicas and the most used regions of the hand tool heads could be defined by these tool mark characteristics. The variation of midline parameters along the <b>sliding</b> <b>tool</b> marks resulted in significant conclusions about the mounting techniques of the hand tool heads on the handles. A smaller angular value between the replica and the handle produced different hand tool impressions which had a major influence on the woodworking efficiency as well. Furthermore, in this paper presented methods should also help to understand other ancient wood manufacture processes...|$|R

40|$|The {{improvement}} of detailed surface documentation methods provides unique tool mark-study {{opportunities in the}} field of archaeological researches. One of these data collection techniques is short-range laser scanning, which creates a digital copy of the object’s morphological characteristics from high-resolution datasets. The aim of our work was the accurate documentation of a Bronze Age sluice box from Mitterberg, Austria with a spatial resolution of 0. 2 mm. Furthermore, the investigation of the entirely preserved tool marks on the surface of this archaeological find was also accomplished by these datasets. The methodology of this tool mark-study can be summarized in the following way: At first, a local hydrologic analysis has been applied to separate the various patterns of tools on the finds’ surface. As a result, the XYZ coordinates of the special points, which represent the edge lines of the <b>sliding</b> <b>tool</b> marks, were calculated by buffer operations in a GIS environment. During {{the second part of the}} workflow, these edge points were utilized to manually clip the triangle meshes of these patterns in reverse engineering software. Finally, circle features were generated and analysed to determine the different sections along these <b>sliding</b> <b>tool</b> marks. In conclusion, the movement of the hand tool could be reproduced by the spatial analysis of the created features, since the horizontal and vertical position of the defined circle centre points indicated the various phases of the movements. This research shows an exact workflow to determine the fine morphological structures on the surface of the archaeological find...|$|R
50|$|Web pages {{will often}} require more screen space than is {{available}} for a particular display resolution. Most modern browsers will place a scrollbar (a <b>sliding</b> <b>tool</b> {{at the side of}} the screen that allows the user to move the page up or down, or side-to-side) in the window to allow the user to see all content. Scrolling horizontally is less prevalent than vertical scrolling, not only because such pages often do not print properly, but because it inconveniences the user more so than vertical scrolling would (because lines are horizontal; scrolling back and forth for every line is much more inconvenient than scrolling after reading a whole screen; also most computer keyboards have page up and down keys, and many computer mice have vertical scroll wheels, but the horizontal scrolling equivalents are rare). When web pages are stored in a common directory of a web server, they become a website.|$|R

40|$|Click on the DOI link {{to access}} the article (may not be free). Effects of {{friction}} stir processing (FSP) parameters and reinforcements on the wear behavior of 6061 -T 6 based hybrid composites were investigated. A mathematical formulation was derived to calculate the wear volume loss of the composites. The experimental results were contrasted {{with the results of}} the proposed model. The influences of <b>sliding</b> distance, <b>tool</b> traverse and rotational speeds, as well as graphite (Gr) and titanium carbide (TiC) volume fractions on the wear volume loss of the composites were also investigated using the prepared formulation. The results demonstrated that the wear volume loss of the composites significantly increased with increasing <b>sliding</b> distance, <b>tool</b> traverse speed, and rotational speed; while the wear volume loss decreased with increasing volume fraction of the reinforcements. A minimum wear volume loss for the hybrid composites with complex reinforcements was specified at the inclusion ratio of 50 % TiC+ Al 2 O 3, because of improved lubricant ability, as well as resistance to brittleness and wear. New possibilities to develop wear-resistant aluminum-based composites for different industrial applications were proposed...|$|R

40|$|Incremental {{sheet forming}} (ISF) is a {{promising}} forming process perfectly suitable for manufacturing customized products with large plastic deformation {{by using a}} simple moving tool. Up to now, however, the effects of contact conditions at the sheet interface are not well understood. The aim of this work is to study the effect of tool type and size on the formability and surface integrity during the forming process. Experimental tests were carried out on aluminum sheets of 7075 -O to create a straight groove with four different tools (φ 30,φ 25. 4,φ 20 andφ 10 mm). One tool tip was fitted with a roller ball (φ 25. 4 mm) while the other three were sliding tips. The contact force, friction and failure depth were evaluated. A finite element (FE) model of the process {{was set up in}} an explicit code LS-DYNA and the strain behavior and thickness distribution with different tools were evaluated and compared with the experimental results. This study provides important insights into the relatively high formability observed in the ISF process. Microscopic observations of the surface topography revealed that a rolling tool tip produced better surface integrity as compared with a <b>sliding</b> <b>tool</b> tip, wherein, distinct scratch patterns in the tool traverse direction were evident...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. RNA-Seq {{technology}} offers new high-throughput ways for transcript identification and quantification based on short reads, and has recently attracted great interest. The problem is usually modeled by a weighted splicing graph whose nodes stand for exons and whose edges stand for split alignments to the exons. The task consists {{of finding a}} number of paths, together with their expression levels, which optimally explain the coverages of the graph under various fitness functions, such least sum of squares. In (Tomescu et al. RECOMB-seq 2013) we showed that under general fitness functions, if we allow a polynomially bounded number of paths in an optimal solution, this problem can be solved in polynomial time by a reduction to a min-cost flow program. In this paper we further refine this problem by asking for a bounded number k of paths that optimally explain the splicing graph. This problem becomes NP-hard in the strong sense, but we give a fast combinatorial algorithm based on dynamic programming for it. In order to obtain a practical tool, we implement three optimizations and heuristics, which achieve better performance on real data, and similar or better performance on simulated data, than state-of-the-art tools Cufflinks, IsoLasso and <b>SLIDE.</b> Our <b>tool,</b> called Traph, is available a...|$|R
