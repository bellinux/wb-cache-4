40|$|International audienceMetastability is a {{property}} of systems composed of many interacting parts wherein the parts exhibit simultaneously {{a tendency to}} function autonomously (local segregation) and a tendency to cooperate (global integration). We study anisotropically coupled map lattices and discover that for specific values of the coupling control parameters the entire <b>system</b> <b>transits</b> <b>to</b> a metastable regime. We show that this regime manifests a quasi-stable state in which the system can flexibly switch to another such state. We briefly discuss the relevance of our findings for information processing, functional integration, metastability in the brain, and phase transitions in complex systems...|$|R

40|$|We discuss {{dissipative}} chaos showing symmetries in {{the phase}} space and nonclassical statistics for a parametrically driven nonlinear Kerr resonator (PDNR). In this system an oscillatory mode is {{created in the}} process of degenerate down-conversion of photons under interaction with a train of external Gaussian pulses. For chaotic regime we demonstrate, that the Poincaré section showing a strange attractor, as well as the resonator mode contour plots of the Wigner functions display two-fold symmetry in the phase space. We show that quantum-to-classical correspondence is strongly violated for some chaotic regimes of the PDNR. Considering the second-order correlation function we show that the high-level of photons correlation leading to squeezing in the regular regime strongly decreases if the <b>system</b> <b>transits</b> <b>to</b> the chaotic regime. Thus, observation of the photon-number correlation allows to extract information about the chaotic regime. Comment: 8 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

40|$|We review recent {{results from}} {{extensive}} simulations of the crystallization of athermal polymer packings. It is shown that above a certain packing density, and for sufficiently long simulations, all random assemblies of freely-jointed chains of tangent hard spheres of uniform size show a spontaneous transition into a crystalline phase. These polymer crystals adopt predominantly random {{hexagonal close packed}} morphologies. An analysis of the local environment around monomers based on the shape {{and size of the}} Voronoi polyhedra clearly shows that Voronoi cells become more spherical and more symmetric as the <b>system</b> <b>transits</b> <b>to</b> the ordered state. The change in the local environment leads to an increase in the monomer translational contribution to the entropy of the system, which acts as the driving force for the phase transition. A comparison of the crystallization of hard-sphere polymers and monomers highlights similarities and differences resulting from the constraints imposed by chain connectivity...|$|R

40|$|Extended x-ray {{absorption}} fine-structure (EXAFS) measurements {{have been}} carried out on Ni_ 50 Mn_ 35 Sn_ 15 in the austenitic and martensitic phase. The temperatures associated with structural and magnetic phase transformations are obtained from magnetization measurements. The system orders ferromagnetically below 319 K while the structural phase transition occurs at T_M ∼ 200 K. EXAFS measurements {{have been carried}} out at Mn and Ni K-edges and changes associated with respect to the local structure of these absorbing atoms are compared. Significant changes in the nearest neighbour interactions are seen as the <b>system</b> <b>transits</b> <b>to</b> the low temperature martensitic phase. EXAFS provides evidence for local structural distortion even in the cubic phase that is not seen from the x-ray diffraction studies. The results obtained are understood in terms of changing hybridization between the constituent atoms that influence the electronic structure at the Fermi level, associated with the austenitic-to-martensitic transition.
