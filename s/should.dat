Care <b>should</b> {{be taken to}} prevent the flag from touching the ground, floor or water beneath it. It <b>should</b> be also secured from being torn off or falling {{to the ground and}} it <b>should</b> not be flown outdoors during a heavy rain, blizzard or very strong wind. The flag <b>should</b> never be flown dirty, torn or faded. When no longer in a fit condition to be used, it <b>should</b> be disposed of in a dignified manner, preferably by cutting it in half so as to separate the colors and then, burning.|$|E

5|$|In 1995 {{the group}} {{released}} a report, Digital Terrestrial Broadcasting in Australia, containing the preliminary {{conclusions of the}} group.

5|$|The {{chemistry}} of moscovium {{in aqueous solution}} <b>should</b> essentially be that of the Mc+ and Mc3+ ions. The former <b>should</b> be easily hydrolyzed and not be easily complexed with halides, cyanide, and ammonia. Moscovium(I) hydroxide (McOH), carbonate (Mc2CO3), oxalate (Mc2C2O4), and fluoride (McF) <b>should</b> be soluble in water; the sulfide (Mc2S) <b>should</b> be insoluble; and the chloride (McCl), bromide (McBr), iodide (McI), and thiocyanate (McSCN) <b>should</b> be only slightly soluble, so that adding excess hydrochloric acid would not noticeably affect the solubility of moscovium(I) chloride. Mc3+ <b>should</b> be about as stable as Tl3+ and hence <b>should</b> also be {{an important part of}} moscovium chemistry, although its closest homolog among the elements <b>should</b> be its lighter congener Bi3+. Moscovium(III) fluoride (McF3) and thiozonide (McS3) <b>should</b> be insoluble in water, similar to the corresponding bismuth compounds, while moscovium(III) chloride (McCl3), bromide (McBr3), and iodide (McI3) <b>should</b> be readily soluble and easily hydrolyzed to form oxyhalides such as McOCl and McOBr, again analogous to bismuth. Both moscovium(I) and moscovium(III) <b>should</b> be common oxidation states and their relative stability <b>should</b> depend greatly on what they are complexed with and the likelihood of hydrolysis.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} about {{rational}} and irrational uses of deontological words, such as "should", "ought", and "must", {{referred to as}} "the shoulds". Rationality is taken as a mutual relationship between conceptual schemes and human agency. These are expressed in what Bakhtin referred to as authoritative discourse and internally persuasive discourse respectively. When the conceptual scheme is in place and its authority transparent, and there is interplay between authoritative discourse and internally persuasive discourse, then the <b>shoulds</b> are perceived as rational. When the interplay is disrupted or suppressed the <b>shoulds</b> are seen as irrational. Breakdown occurs in two main ways. First, when the effective conceptual schemes are hidden, and {{the origin of the}} <b>shoulds</b> obscured. We describe some instances of the latter, from philosophy, psychotherapy, and experimental studies of rationality. Second, in technology and science the mutual relationship sometimes breaks down because authoritative discourse is too powerful, and inhibits the interplay in order to maintain itself. After describing these pathologies, we turn to William James, who drew attention to a repair kit for rationality in his detection of the psychologist's fallacy. Describing the work of Dewey and Husserl as elaborations of this, we distinguished two essential aspects of rationality, disciplinary expressed in authoritative discourse, and emancipatory expressed in internally persuasive discourse...|$|R
