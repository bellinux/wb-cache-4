25|$|The primary {{objective}} of a belt press filter is to dewater process sludge {{and much of}} this dewatering occurs in the gravity drainage zone. The gravity drainage zone can achieve a 5 to 10 percent increase in solids concentration. The degree of dewatering in the gravity drainage zone is greatly dependent {{on the type of}} solids, the filter media and the <b>sludge</b> <b>conditioning.</b> The dewatering achieved in the gravity drainage zone is adversely affected if the sludge is poorly spread across the belt or the residence time is insufficient. <b>Sludge</b> <b>conditioning</b> is the addition of chemicals to promote flocculation of particles to form a thickened sludge and to promote dewatering. Dewatering can be promoted by the addition of surfactant and flocculation is achieved via the addition of high molecular weight polymer. Flocculation is improved with optimum polymer dosage, polymer dilution and mixing. The pH of the feed slurry must also be monitored and controlled as low pH decreases flocculation. It is important to find the optimum value for each conditioning parameter as too much polymer or mixing can {{have a negative impact on}} flocculation and greatly increase operating expenses. The effects of <b>sludge</b> <b>conditioning</b> are most apparent in the gravity drainage zone which can be easily replicated on a laboratory scale where the optimum conditioning strategy can be determined. For a belt press filter to be industrially viable it must be economically efficient and thus maximum throughput is desired. Without sufficient conditioning, the gravity drainage is generally the limiting process step, but with optimum dilution the limiting process step can be shifted to the compression zone.|$|E

Both sonication conditioning and sonication-chemical co-conditioning were tested. Final water content of dry sludge {{was used to}} represent the sludge dewaterability. The results showed that sonication significantly changed the sludge dewaterability and the changes were strongly influenced by the ultrasonic power density and time. The best sonication for <b>sludge</b> <b>conditioning,</b> alone or together with chemicals, was 7 s and 0. 8 W/ml. The optimal energy dose was 960 kJ/kgDS while energy input higher than 1200 kJ/kgDS deteriorated the sludge dewatering. Sonication alone only reduced the sludge specific resistance to filtration (SRF) by 40 % and the final water content to 90 %; thus, chemical conditioning was necessary. Combination of FeCl 3 and polyacrylamide (PAM) was very effective for <b>sludge</b> <b>conditioning</b> and the optimal PAM/FeCl 3 was 0. 01. When chemicals were used, sonication effectively reduced the necessary chemical dose by 40 - 50 % but showed little improvement in SRF.

The physical {{properties of the}} composting mass and their influence on the biological activity were also investigated. Three treatments composed of mixtures of raw sludge and co-substrate (commercial fats, protein, and cellulose) were carried out and compared to a control composed of raw <b>sludge.</b> Mixture <b>conditioning</b> {{was performed on the}} basis on air filled porosity (40 %). The results obtained in the co-composting processes reflected a higher biological activity and higher degradation percentages of dry and organic matter when compared with control. Higher temperatures (60, 67 and 62 °C for fats, protein and cellulose, respectively) were also achieved in all co-composting experiments as compared to the control test (55 °C). Biological activity was measured using both Static and Dynamic Respiration Indices obtaining higher values in co-composting experiments compared to the control test. Fats content reduction was higher (66 %) at higher fats content in the initial mixture (10. 6 %). The addition of fats seems also to promote the degradation of cellulose and lignin. Co-composting experiments with fats and cellulose presented higher initial C/N ratio and lower nitrogen losses, 27. 5 and 34. 2 % compared to 40 % for raw sludge. It has been demonstrated that the addition of an adequate co-substrate to raw sludge leads to a higher degradation percentages of the different biochemical fractions and higher nitrogen conservation...|$|R

The experimental results show that increase salinity can decrease the SRF and TTF in mechanical dewatering, and increase the final solid content of the dewatered sludge. At salinity of 10, 000 ppm or higher, the results obtained are comparable to those obtained with chemical addition as the performance of chemicals on sludge SRF and TTF is limited at high salinity.

Current research is focused on pretreatment methods intended {{to increase the efficiency}} of anaerobic digestion. Unfortunately, many of the pretreatment methods studied show little to no improvements in dewaterability of the secondary sludge. This research was carried out to investigate the potential of freezing and combined ultrasound-??freezing methods for simultaneous <b>sludge</b> pretreatment and <b>conditioning.</b> Three methods of freezing were employed; conventional freeze-??thaw (FT), combined ultrasonic-??freezing (UF) and progressive ultrasonic freezing (PUF). The solubilisation of sludge organic matter, evaluated by measuring soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD), showed significant improvements for all freezing methods compared to the controls. The maximum increase in sCOD was 6. 5 times the control for conventional freezing at -?? 30 ?C and 5 freeze-??thaw cycles, 5. 3 times the control for combined ultrasonic freezing at 20 % amplitude and 12 minutes of sonication and 7. 7 times the control for the liquid portion of the progressive ultrasonic freezing samples with a three second sonication pulse {{for the duration of the}} freezing. The dewaterability of the freezing methods was also evaluated by measuring sludge volume index (SVI) and capillary suction time (CST). The three freezing methods showed significant improvements in dewaterability with CST ratios ranging from 0. 12 ? 0. 21 for conventional freezing, 0. 11 -?? 0. 21 for combined ultrasonic freezing and 0. 15 ? 0. 26 for the solid portion of the progressive ultrasonic freezing samples. The freezing methods were compared to three commonly studied pretreatment methods (thermal, microwave and ultrasound) and showed equivalent or better abilities to solubilise sludge organic matter and improve dewaterability. Further tests revealed that the three freezing treatments also resulted in significantly higher concentrations of proteins as well as increased biodegradability and gas production. The gas production ratio over the control was greatest for conventional freezing (1. 52), followed by combined ultrasonic freezing (1. 17) and progressive ultrasonic freezing (1. 13).

It was proved that (1) processes of conditioning cause changes in properties of primary sludge; (2) electrochemical conditioning causes mineralization and stabilization; (3) dewaterability of sludge is improved; (4) the process can be supported using additionally calcium hydroxide and dihydrogen dioxide; (5) optimization of the process can be performed only by improving the effectiveness of selected process parameters...|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{characterize}} anaerobically digested sludge (ADS) and correlate the sludge characteristics {{in terms of}} soluble organic compounds with polymer demand (PD) during <b>sludge</b> <b>conditioning.</b> The PD required to achieve maximum dewatering of the ADS studied is {{in the range of}} 8 - 10 kg polymer/dry ton. The commonly used capillary suction time parameter to evaluate the solid-liquid separation ability was not a reliable indicator for assessing dewatering. Instead, in this study, a modified centrifugal technique proposed by Higgins (Higgins MCT) was used to assess the maximum achievable dry solids content of the biosolids cake. The Higgins MCT is readily obtained using a bench-scale centrifuge equipped with a modified centrifuge bucket. Using the Higgins MCT, the maximum dry solids contents obtained from conditioned ADS was 30 wt%. These values were comparable to the dry solids content obtained from the same sludge at full-scale level. Our results suggest Higgins MCT is suitable for assessing the final dry solids content and simulating the dewatering process...|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of algae in source waters not only causes {{problems in the}} water treatment process, but also complicates the treatment and disposal of sludge. This {{has become a major}} concern in Taiwan because of the increasing eutrophication of water sources. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effects of algae during aging process on the characteristics of potable water treatment residuals and investigate their conditioning in order to provide water treatment plants with guidelines for treating algae-containing sludge. In this study, we measured the bound water content and CST to evaluate the influence of algae and their exudates on <b>sludge</b> <b>conditioning.</b> The change in zeta potential was monitored during sludge aging. During the aging process up to 5 days, the surface charge of sludge became more negative and the dewaterability was enhanced by algal exudates. Microphotographs of the algae-containing sludge suggest that algae and their exudates cause the bio-flocculation phenomenon. © 1999 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the glyphosate adsorption by water treatment residual (termed as alum sludge) in dewatered form (DAS) and liquid form (LAS). Batch adsorption tests were carried out with DAS at different pH, particle size and DAS mass. Standard jar tests were conducted with LAS at two different concentrations (3 g/l and 5 g/l) for glyphosate adsorption. Thereafter, the glyphosate-enriched LAS (after adsorption tests) was subjected to <b>sludge</b> <b>conditioning</b> procedure with polymer LT 25 as conditioner to explore any possible further glyphosate reduction. The results indicate that alum sludge has the high adsorption capacity of 85. 9 mg/g for DAS and 113. 6 mg/g for LAS. This demonstrated {{the potential of the}} alum sludge to be an efficient and cost-effective adsorbent for glyphosate removal in comparison with other adsorbents, such as soils, humic substances, clay minerals, and layered double hydroxides (LDH). The polymer conditioning of the glyphosate-enriched LAS cannot bring about the further glyphosate reduction in the supernatant of the dewatered LAS. Overall, this study promotes the beneficial reuse of alum sludge in wide range of pollutant control in environmental engineering...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{cationic}} surfactant (cationic cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide, CTAB) on {{the improvement of the}} sludge dewaterability using the cationic flocculant (cationic polyacrylamide, CPAM) were analyzed. Residual turbidity of supernatant, dry solid (DS) content, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), specific resistance to filtration (SRF), zeta potential, floc size, and settling rate were investigated, respectively. The result showed that the CTAB positively affected the <b>sludge</b> <b>conditioning</b> and dewatering. Compared to not using surfactant, the DS and the settling rate increased by 8 %– 21. 2 % and 9. 2 %– 15. 1 %, respectively, at 40 mg?L 21 CPAM, 1061023 mg?L 21 CTAB, and pH 3. The residual turbidities of the supernatant and SRF were reduced by 14. 6 %– 31. 1 % and 6. 9 %– 7. 8 % compared with turbidities and SRF without surfactant. Furthermore, the release of sludge EPS, the increases in size of the sludge flocs, and the sludge settling rate were found to be the main reasons for the CTAB improvement of sludge dewatering performance...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} industrial {{utilization of}} polyacrylamide to assist water clarification, <b>sludge</b> <b>conditioning,</b> papermaking, and secondary oil recovery leads to environmental pollution. In this work, an acrylamide degrading bacterium was isolated from paper mill effluent at Charan mahadevi, Tamilnadu, India. The minimal medium containing acrylamide (40 mM) {{served as a}} sole source of carbon and nitrogen for acrylamide degrading bacteria. The bacterial strain has grown well in 40 mM acrylamide at pH (6 - 7) at 30 degrees C. Within 24 - 48 h acrylamide was converted into acrylic acid and other metabolites. Based on biochemical characteristics and 16 S rRNA gene sequence, the bacterial strain was identified as Gram negative, diplobacilli Moraxella osloensis MSU 11. The acrylamide hydrolyzing bacterial enzyme acrylamidase was purified by HPLC. The enzyme molecular weight {{was determined to be}} approximately 38 kDa by SDS-PAGE using reference enzyme Pectinase. These results show that M. osloensis MSU 11 has a potential to degrade the acrylamide present in the environment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
