40|$|The sensor probes {{deployed}} in the electric fields will cause the distortion in the vicinities, therefore it may significantly affect {{the accuracy of the}} measurements in the electric fields. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to separate the electric field distortion due to the <b>spherical</b> <b>sensor</b> probes in a uniform electric field. Moreover, we also investigate the impacts of the <b>spherical</b> <b>sensor</b> probes to the original electric field distortion in terms of the size of sensor probes, the electrode materials, the coupling between the polar electrodes in the design of sensor probes. Our simulation results show that a passive electric field sensor system with the bands from 5 Hz to 200 kHz, and a 20 nF capacitance, combining with our new electric field distortion correction scheme, can surprise meet the requirements of the practical engineering. Moreover, our simulation results also show that the electric field sensor probe system we suggested only has 0. 16 % nonlinear errors compared with the corresponding original system measurements.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a flexible approach for calibrating omnidirectional single viewpoint sensors from planar grids. Current approaches {{in the field}} are either based on theoretical properties and do not take into account important factors such as misalignment or camera-lens distortion or over-parametrised which leads to minimisation problems that are difficult to solve. Recent techniques based on polynomial approximations lead to impractical calibration methods. Our model is based on an exact theoretical projection function to which we add well identified parameters to model real-world errors. This leads to a full methodology from the initialisation of the intrinsic parameters to the general calibration. We also discuss the validity of the approach for fish-eye and spherical models. An implementation of the method is available as opensource software on the author’s Web page.

40|$|General structure-from-motion {{methods are}} not adept at dealing with {{constrained}} camera motions, {{even though such}} motions greatly simplify vision tasks like mobile robot localization. Typical ego-motion techniques designed for such a purpose require locating feature correspondences between images. However, there are many cases where features cannot be matched robustly. For example, images from panoramic sensors are limited by nonuniform angular sampling, which can complicate the feature matching process under wide baseline motions. In this paper we compute the planar ego-motion of a <b>spherical</b> <b>sensor</b> without correspondences. We propose a generalized Hough transform on the space of planar motions. Our transform directly processes the information contained within all the possible feature pair combinations between two images, thereby circumventing the need to isolate the best corresponding matches.

40|$|Direction of Arrival (DOA) {{estimation}} is {{a fundamental}} problem in acoustic signal processing. It is used in a diverse range of applications, including spatial filtering, speech dereverberation, source separation and diarization. Intensity vector-based DOA estimation is attractive, especially for <b>spherical</b> <b>sensor</b> arrays, because it is computationally efficient. Two such methods are presented which operate on a spherical harmonic decomposition of a sound field observed using a spherical microphone array. The first uses Pseudo-Intensity Vectors (PIVs) and works well in acoustic environments where only one sound source is active at any time. The second uses Subspace Pseudo-Intensity Vectors (SSPIVs) and is targeted at environments where multiple simultaneous sources and significant levels of reverberation make the problem more challenging. Analytical models are used to quantify the effects of an interfering source, diffuse noise and sensor noise on PIVs and SSPIVs. The accuracy of DOA estimation using PIVs and SSPIVs is compared against the state-of-the-art in simulations including realistic reverberation and noise for single and multiple, stationary and moving sources. Finally, robust performance of the proposed methods is demonstrated using speech recordings in real acoustic environments...|$|E

Such experiments have been successfully flown on a variety of spacecraft including sounding rockets and satellites. Typical instrument designs involve a series of trades, depending on the science objectives, type of platform (e. g., spinning or 3 -axis stabilized), expected plasma regime where the measurements will be made, available telemetry, budget, etc. In general, ionospheric DC electric field instruments that achieve accuracies of 0. 1 mV/m or better, place <b>spherical</b> <b>sensors</b> at large distances (10 m or more) from the spacecraft body in order to extend well beyond the spacecraft wake and sheath and to achieve large signal-to-noise ratios for DC and long wavelength measurements.

This work addresses a peculiar aspect which drastically limits the applicability of direct registration, namely {{the weakness of the}} convergence domain. First, we propose an activation function based on the conditioning of the RGB and ICP point-to-plane error terms. This function strengthens the geometric error influence in the first coarse iterations, while the intensity data term dominates in the finer increments. The information gathered from the geometric and photometric cost functions is not only considered for improving the system observability, but for exploiting the different convergence properties and convexity of each data term. Next, we develop a set of strategies as a flexible regularization and a pixel saliency selection to further improve the quality and robustness of this approach. The methodology is formulated for a generic warping model and results are given using perspective and <b>spherical</b> <b>sensor</b> models. Finally, our method is validated in different RGB-D spherical datasets, including both indoor and outdoor real sequences and using the KITTI VO/SLAM benchmark dataset.

40|$|Fluvial {{sediment}} transport {{is controlled by}} hydraulics, sediment properties and arrangement, and flow history {{across a range of}} time scales. This physical complexity has led to ambiguous definition of the reference frame (Lagrangian or Eulerian) in which {{sediment transport}} is analysed. A general Eulerian-Lagrangian approach accounts for inertial characteristics of particles in a Lagrangian (particle fixed) frame, and for the hydrodynamics in an independent Eulerian frame. The necessary Eulerian-Lagrangian transformations are simplified under the assumption of an ideal Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), rigidly attached at the centre of the mass of a sediment particle. Real, commercially available IMU sensors can provide high frequency data on accelerations and angular velocities (hence forces and energy) experienced by grains during entrainment and motion, if adequately customized. IMUs are subjected to significant error accu- mulation but they can be used for statistical parametrisation of an Eulerian-Lagrangian model, for coarse sediment particles and over the temporal scale of individual entrainment events. In this thesis an Eulerian-Lagrangian model is introduced and evaluated experimentally. Absolute inertial accelerations were recorded at a 4 Hz frequency from a spherical instrumented particle (111 mm diameter and 2383 kg/m 3 density) in a series of entrainment threshold experiments on a fixed idealised bed. The grain-top inertial acceleration entrainment threshold was approximated at 44 and 51 mg for slopes 0. 026 and 0. 037 respectively. The saddle inertial acceleration entrainment threshold was at 32 and 25 mg for slopes 0. 044 and 0. 057 respectively. For the evaluation of the complete Eulerian-Lagrangian model two prototype sensors are presented: an idealised (spherical) with a diameter of 90 mm and an ellipsoidal with axes 100, 70 and 30 mm. Both are instrumented with a complete IMU, capable of sampling 3 D inertial accelerations and 3 D angular velocities at 50 Hz. After signal analysis, the results can be used to parametrize sediment movement but they do not contain positional information. The two sensors (spherical and ellipsoidal) were tested in a series of entrainment experiments, similar to the evaluation of the 111 mm prototype, for a slope of 0. 02. The <b>spherical</b> <b>sensor</b> entrained at discharges of 24. 8 ± 1. 8 l/s while the same threshold for the ellipsoidal sensor was 45. 2 ± 2. 2 l/s. Kinetic energy calculations were used to quantify the particle-bed energy exchange under fluvial (discharge at 30 l/s) and non-fluvial conditions. All the experiments suggest that the effect of the inertial characteristics of coarse sediments on their motion is comparable to the effect hydrodynamic forces. The coupling of IMU sensors with advanced telemetric systems can lead to the tracking of Lagrangian particle trajectories, at a frequency and accuracy that will permit the testing of diffusion/dispersion models across the range of particle diameters...|$|E

For Earth's atmosphere condition, this method is typically applied to the hot wires made of temperature dependent electrical conductor, typically platinum or tungsten, which working with overheat {{in reference to the}} ambient temperature estimate wind velocity. In case of the low pressure atmospheres, like this on Mars, the mean free path for molecules, due to the rarefied ambient conditions, is much bigger, Using hot wires designed for Earth in this conditions gives that heat exchange at macroscopic scale which does not to obey medium continuum model but rather reveals ballistic behavior Thus, instead of using hot wire, a structure of bigger dimension like hot films are usually propose for such a kind of application. The work included in this thesis is the contribution of the author Lukasz Kowalski to the goal of developing a new generation of wind sensors for the atmosphere of Mars. The work consists in the conception, design, simulation, manufacture and measurement of two novel types wind sensors based on thermal anemometers. The first kind of concept has been developed in this thesis by using hot silicon die made out of silicon wafer of approximate size: 1. 5 x 1. 5 x 0. 5 mm with platinum resistances deposited on top in order to heat it and sense its temperature. These work was {{been a part of the}} bigger undertaking under the project name: "Colaboracíoon en el desarrollo de la estación medioambiental denominada REMS ". Inside the project REMS author of thesis was responsible for sensor shape development and concept validation of proposed geometry. Thermal-fluidical model of the device as well as characterization and behavior were analyzed for a simplified 2 -D wind model for typical Martian atmospheric conditions. REMS was a Spanish contribution to the NASA mission MSL which has been a great success since rover Curiosity has landed on Mars on 8 th August 2012 on Mars near to the Gale Crater location.

The present work explores the physical processes behind this extreme sensitivity and how to best take advantage of them for practical applications of this technology. I begin by examining the nature of the interaction between the intense electromagnetic elds that build up in the optical biosensor and the biomolecules that bind to its surface. This work addresses the need for a coherent and thorough physical model {{that can be used to}} predict sensor behavior for a range of experimental parameters. While this knowledge will prove critical for the development of this technology, it has also shone a light on nonlinear thermo-optical and optical phenomena that these devices are uniquely suited to probing. The surprisingly rapid transient response of toroidal WGM biosensors despite sub-femtomolar analyte concentrations is also addressed. The development of asymmetric boundary layers around these devices under ow is revealed to enhance the capture rate of proteins from solution compared to the <b>spherical</b> <b>sensors</b> used previously. These lessons will guide the design of ow systems to minimize measurement time and consumption of precious sample, a key factor in any medically relevant assay. Finally, experimental results suggesting that WGM biosensors could be used to improve the quantitative detection of small-molecule biomarkers in exhaled breath condensate demonstrate how their exceptional sensitivity and transient response can enable the use of this noninvasive method to probe respiratory distress. WGM bioensors are unlike any other analytical tool, and the work presented here focuses on answering engineering questions surrounding their performance and potential. </p...|$|R
40|$|The thermal anemometry is {{a method}} which allows to {{estimate}} wind magnitude be the mean of measuring heat transfer to the ambient in a forced convection process. For Earth's atmosphere condition, this method is typically applied to the hot wires made of temperature dependent electrical conductor, typically platinum or tungsten, which working with overheat {{in reference to the}} ambient temperature estimate wind velocity. In case of the low pressure atmospheres, like this on Mars, the mean free path for molecules, due to the rarefied ambient conditions, is much bigger, Using hot wires designed for Earth in this conditions gives that heat exchange at macroscopic scale which does not to obey medium continuum model but rather reveals ballistic behavior Thus, instead of using hot wire, a structure of bigger dimension like hot films are usually propose for such a kind of application. The work included in this thesis is the contribution of the author Lukasz Kowalski to the goal of developing a new generation of wind sensors for the atmosphere of Mars. The work consists in the conception, design, simulation, manufacture and measurement of two novel types wind sensors based on thermal anemometers. The first kind of concept has been developed in this thesis by using hot silicon die made out of silicon wafer of approximate size: 1. 5 x 1. 5 x 0. 5 mm with platinum resistances deposited on top in order to heat it and sense its temperature. These work was {{been a part of the}} bigger undertaking under the project name: "Colaboracíoon en el desarrollo de la estación medioambiental denominada REMS ". Inside the project REMS author of thesis was responsible for sensor shape development and concept validation of proposed geometry. Thermal-fluidical model of the device as well as characterization and behavior were analyzed for a simplified 2 -D wind model for typical Martian atmospheric conditions. REMS was a Spanish contribution to the NASA mission MSL which has been a great success since rover Curiosity has landed on Mars on 8 th August 2012 on Mars near to the Gale Crater location. Since then has been constantly running experiments on the Red Planet sending data to Earth for interpretation. From the experience and knowledge gained during REMS project, the author came out with an idea of the novel <b>spherical</b> <b>sensor</b> structure overcoming some fragility problems detected in the REMS wind sensor. The new 3 -D wind sensor concept, besides this advantage, also provided a radical simplification of data post-processing providing comprehensive thermal model based on numerical simulation for any possible wind occurrence. This new device has been developed under Spanish Ministry of the Science and Innovation project: "Sensor de viento para la superficie de Marte para la mission Metnet''. This project, denominated as MEIGA, was a joint effort of many Spanish institution under leadership of Instituto Nacional de Tecnica Aeroespacial (INTA) for the development of space technology for Mars oriented application in a framework of upcoming space mission. To sum up, author's work include contributions to the development of two wind sensor concepts: 1. REMS wind sensor on board of the rover Curiosity in the surface of Mars since August 8 th 2012 2. Spherical wind sensor concept developed in a course of MEIGA projec...|$|E
40|$|Many of {{the flow}} {{metering}} techniques used in industrial applications have finite limits at slow fluid velocities {{in the order of}} 10 mm/s. By comparison, many environmental flow rates occur two or more orders of magnitude below this, examples being the rate of sap flow in plants, the percolation rate of rainfall into soil and through the landscape, flows in the benthic boundary layer of lakes, the movement of water through sandy river banks or in the swash zone of beaches, or the seepage rate of groundwater into river beds. Unlike well-defined industrial flow measurement systems, nature is extravagant with her variability. To counter this, sensor systems in environmental engineering have to be widely flung, inexpensive and highly matched. ‘Smart’ sensors must therefore be simple designs having calibration techniques that can be highly automated. Additionally, such sensors must be able to compute real data locally, apply temperature corrections, compensate for inherent non-linearity and integrate without fuss into environmental logging systems. This thesis describes the development of sensors and experimental techniques in five very slow flow rate applications in environmental engineering via three published papers and two papers in submission: - ¹Gravitational flows in a large stratified water body were identified using smart temperature strings; these sensors demonstrated new techniques for low-cost but high-precision thermistor temperature measurements, sensor temperature matching, the generation of complex algorithms within a simple sensor and a method for obtaining two-point calibrations for non-linear sensors. Field work with these sensor strings identified ‘short-circuiting’ of an urban reservoir during a storm event over the catchment which led to denser cold-water inflows moving along the bottom boundary layer of the lake. ²The movement of ‘wetting fronts’ in the soil below plants mobilizes toxic salts left behind in the soil profile by crop evapotranspiration processes that take up only fresh water. These problems are exacerbated in semi-arid areas under crops irrigated with brackish water. Automatic recording of soil salinity levels is possible using an instrument based on the combination of an EC (electrical conductivity) sensor with a platinum resistance temperature sensor within a funnel shaped ‘wetting front detector’ buried in the soil. These two combined sensors extend the usage of the low-cost 16 -bit charge-balance analog-to-digital converter developed for use in stratification measurements. ³Measurement of sap flow in irrigated agriculture for determining when to irrigate crops was found to be of limited use for determining ‘when to water’ because the flow signal is masked by the plant’s genetically-coded regulatory systems. A new ‘double bridge’ analog control circuit for a self-heating thermistor was designed and described as a thermal diffusion sensor to study plant water status and the onset of irrigation stress in grapevines once sap flow had ceased. A laboratory experiment on a cut vine cane demonstrated that this thermal diffusion sensor was sensitive enough to track the response of the living cane to external forcing events that changed its plant water status. ⁴The same double-bridge thermistor control circuit was used to investigate the lower limits of very slow upward flow measurement for use in the funnels of automatic seepage meters designed to monitor groundwater flows into the bottom of rivers and lakes. Theoretical, CFD (computational fluid dynamics) and two different experimental studies showed that flows between 0. 03 mm/s and 3 mm/s could be measured in the presence of buoyant thermal plumes from the self-heated <b>spherical</b> <b>sensor</b> in free water. ⁵A new type of null-buoyancy thermal flow sensor is described; it is designed specifically for the measurement of downward flows below 3 mm/s using a single thermistor. A typical application of such flow meter technology would be in the measurement of the hydraulic conductivity of soil to determine the rate at which rainfall can enter the landscape without run-off and erosion. The thermistor power dissipation is adjusted so that the upward thrust of the buoyant thermal plume from the warm thermistor sensor exactly counter-balances the downward bulk fluid velocity, resulting in flow stagnation at the sensor tip characterized by a corresponding local peak in the sensor’s temperature response. Power dissipation must increase with the square of an increasing flow velocity to maintain this null-point. ¹Skinner, A. J. and Lambert, M. F.

30|$|This article {{proposes a}} novel method of image unwrapping for spherical {{omnidirectional}} images acquired through a non-single viewpoint (NSVP) omnidirectional sensor. It has three key steps i.e. (1) calibrate {{the camera to}} obtain parameters describing the <b>spherical</b> omnidirectional <b>sensor,</b> (2) map world points onto mirror points and, subsequently, onto image points, and (3) set up the projection plane for the final image unwrapping. Based on the projection plane selected, the algorithm is able to produce three common forms of unwrapping, namely cylindrical panoramic, cuboid panoramic, and ground plane view using closed form mapping equations. The motivation for developing this technique is to address the complexity in using a NSVP omnidirectional sensor and ultimately encouraging its application in robotics field. One of the main advantages of a NSVP omnidirectional sensor is that the mirror can often be obtained {{at a lower price}} as compared to the single viewpoint counterpart.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, piezoceramics {{are widely}} used in sensor technology. However, due to their brittle nature, they can be cracked either in severe {{environmental}} conditions or during careless installation. Besides, the abrasion of their surface is a challenging problem in some applications. Hereby, the usage of a protective layer can prolong their effective working life. In this study, we analyze the electro-elastic behavior of a <b>spherical</b> piezoceramic <b>sensor</b> coated by a homogeneous protective layer. Then, with the motivation of reducing possible interfacial problems across the sensor/coating interface, and also improving the sensing ability of the coated sensor, material gradation concept is utilized. For this intent, two sensor/coating systems are studied: a piezoelectric sensor coated with a functionally graded material, and a functionally graded piezoelectric sensor coated with a homogeneous material. The governing equations are derived {{within the context of}} electro-elasticity theory and closed-form solutions are presented for coated sensors. It is concluded that a piezoceramic sensor protected with a functionally graded coating can improve the interfacial condition of the coated sensor, as well as enhancing its sensing ability...|$|R

We present here a simple modified seawater medium and handling techniques which {{have been used to}} maintain actively growing Trichodesmium thiebautii in laboratory culture for over 1 year. The cultured population, isolated from coastal Atlantic waters, has a growth rate of 0. 23 division day- 1 and exhibits light-dependent nitrogen fixation during exponential growth.
