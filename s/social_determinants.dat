25|$|Sweden’s {{new public}} health policy, which came into force in 2003, has been {{identified}} as a key example of mainstreaming gender in health policies. According to the World Health Organization, Sweden’s public health policy is designed to address not only the broader <b>social</b> <b>determinants</b> of health, but also the way in which gender is woven into the public health strategy. The policy specifically highlights its commitment to address and reduce gender-based inequalities in health.|$|E
25|$|Life {{expectancy}} {{at birth}} is significantly lower for First Nations babies than for {{babies in the}} Canadian population as a whole. , Indian and Northern Affairs Canada estimates First Nations life expectancy to be 8.1 years shorter for males and 5.5 years shorter for females. Where females {{in the general population}} had a life expectancy at birth of 82 years, First Nations females had a life expectancy of 76 years. In males the life expectancy for First Nations individuals was 69 years as opposed to 77 in the general population. The reasons behind the lower birth rate for First Nations individuals are varied and complex; however, <b>social</b> <b>determinants</b> of health are thought to play a big part.|$|E
25|$|LGBT {{health issues}} have {{received}} disproportionately {{low levels of}} medical research, leading to difficulties in assessing appropriate strategies for LGBT treatment. For instance, a review of medical literature regarding LGBT patients revealed that there are significant gaps in the medical understanding of cervical cancer in lesbian and bisexual individuals {{it is unclear whether}} its prevalence in this community is a result of probability or some other preventable cause. It is incorrectly assumed that LGBT women have a lower incidence of cervical cancer than their heterosexual counterparts, resulting in lower rates of screening. Such findings illustrate the need for continued research focused on the circumstances and needs of LGBT individuals and the inclusion in policy frameworks of sexual orientation and gender identity as <b>social</b> <b>determinants</b> of health.|$|E

25|$|In the Women and Gender Equity Knowledge Network's Final Report to the WHO Commission on <b>Social</b> <b>Determinants</b> of Health in 2007, {{health systems}} in many {{countries}} were noted to {{have been unable to}} deliver adequately on gender equity in health. One explanation for this issue is that many healthcare systems tend to neglect the fact that men and women’s health needs can be very different. In the report, studies have found evidence that the healthcare system can promote gender disparities in health through the lack of gender equity in terms of the way women are regarded - as both consumers (users) and producers (carers) of health care services. For instance, healthcare systems tend to regard women as objects rather than subjects, where services are often provided to women as a means of something else rather on the well-being of women. In the case of reproductive health services, these services are often provided as a form of fertility control rather than as care for women's well-being. Additionally, although the majority of the workforce in health care systems are female, many of the working conditions remain discriminatory towards women. Many studies have shown that women are often expected to conform to male work models that ignore their special needs, such as childcare or protection from violence. This significantly reduces the ability and efficiency of female caregivers providing care to patients, particularly female ones.|$|E
2500|$|According to the World Health Organization, <b>social</b> <b>determinants</b> {{of health}} include early child development, globalization, health systems, {{measurement}} and evidence, urbanization, employment conditions, social exclusion, public health conditions, {{and women and}} gender equality. [...] More generally, the WHO considers the circumstances of daily life and structural drivers, which determine health outcome differentials, as the <b>social</b> <b>determinants</b> of health. Different exposures and vulnerabilities to disease and injury determined by social, occupational, and physical environments and conditions, result in more or less vulnerability to poor health. Structural drivers, on the other hand, include stratification in society, biases and societal norms, economic and social policy, and governance. [...] These themes are condensed into a distinct structure of defining the <b>social</b> <b>determinants</b> of health in poverty. The World Health Organization's <b>Social</b> <b>Determinants</b> Council recognized two distinct forms of <b>social</b> <b>determinants</b> for health- social position and socioeconomic and political context. The following divisions are adapted from World Health Organization's <b>Social</b> <b>Determinants</b> Conceptual Framework for explaining and understanding <b>social</b> <b>determinants</b> of health.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>social</b> <b>determinants</b> {{of health}} in poverty {{describe}} the factors that affect impoverished populations' health and health inequality. Inequalities in health stem from the conditions of people's lives, including living conditions, work environment, age, and other social factors, and how these affect people's {{ability to respond to}} illness. These conditions are also shaped by political, social, and economic structures. [...] The majority of people around the globe do not meet their potential best health because of a [...] "toxic combination of bad policies, economics, and politics". Daily living conditions work together with these structural drivers to result in the <b>social</b> <b>determinants</b> of health.|$|E

30|$|Although the {{individual}} is the key actor in his/her own wellbeing and {{may be seen as}} responsible for taking action, the local community, the service providers and the society on the whole need to support and aid him/her when needed.

Especially when the goal is to have an influence on the <b>social</b> <b>determinant</b> of health concerted action of the whole society is required.|$|R
40|$|Housing {{is a key}} <b>social</b> <b>determinant</b> of health. The {{relationship}} between housing outcomes and health outcomes is bi-directional: housing affects healthoutcomes, and health affects housing outcomes. There are clear links between the quality and location of housing and health outcomes. The impacts of housing on health vary between geographic and climatic locations and contexts.

One way of categorisingthese is: infrastructure improvements; addressing behavioural factors; and adjustments to policy environments...|$|R
2500|$|According to Moss, {{socioeconomic}} {{factors that}} affect impoverished populations such as education, income inequality, and occupation, represent the strongest and most consistent predictors of health and mortality. [...] The inequalities in the apparent circumstances of individual's lives, like individuals' access to health care, schools, their conditions of work and leisure, households, communities, towns, or cities, affect people's ability to lead a flourishing life and maintain health, according to the WHO. The inequitable distribution of health-harmful living conditions, experiences, and structures, is {{not by any means}} natural, [...] "but {{is the result of a}} toxic combination of poor social policies and programmes, unfair economic arrangements, and bad politics". Therefore, the conditions of individual's daily life are responsible for the <b>social</b> <b>determinants</b> of health and a major part of health inequities between and within countries. Along with these social conditions, [...] "Gender, education, occupation, income, ethnicity, and place of residence are all closely linked to people's access to, experiences of, and benefits from health care." [...] <b>Social</b> <b>determinants</b> of disease can be attributed to broad social forces such as racism, gender inequality, poverty, violence, and war. This is important because health quality, health distribution, and social protection of health in a population affect the development status of a nation. Since health has been considered a fundamental human right, one author suggests the <b>social</b> <b>determinants</b> of health determine the distribution of human dignity.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Social</b> <b>determinants</b> {{of health}} in poverty reveal inequalities in health. Health is defined [...] "as feeling sound, well, vigorous, and {{physically}} able {{to do things that}} most people ordinarily can do". Measurements of health take several forms including subjective health reports completed by individuals and surveys that measure physical impairment, vitality and well being, diagnosis of serious chronic disease, and expected life longevity.|$|E
2500|$|The {{health care}} system {{represents}} a social determinant of health {{as well as it}} influences other determining factors. People's access to health care, their experiences there, and the benefits they gain are closely related to other <b>social</b> <b>determinants</b> of health like income, gender, education, ethnicity, occupation, and more. For poor people, systematic barriers in the social structure are formidable, especially financing. Medicaid and maternity coverage structures have complex and time-consuming registration processes, along with long waits and unsure eligibility.|$|E
5000|$|Poverty is an {{independent}} risk factor and <b>social</b> <b>determinant</b> of health; the lower the income level the poorer the health outcomes.

2500|$|Because of its well-organised {{health care}} system and {{effective}} water sanitation facilities, Rita R. Colwell of the James Baker Institute says Zimbabwe was historically one of the African countries least affected by cholera. A news commentary in The Lancet said that, under President Robert Mugabe, the country's health programs were negatively impacted, resulting in diminished health care for those infected with cholera. [...] According to a draft paper from the WHO's World Conference on <b>Social</b> <b>Determinants</b> in Health, there were fewer health workers in the villages than in urban areas, which hindered early detection and isolation of cholera cases.|$|E
50|$|A {{more robust}} view of health {{literacy}} includes {{the ability to}} understand scientific concepts, content, and health research; skills in spoken, written, and online communication; critical interpretation of mass media messages; navigating complex systems {{of health care and}} governance; knowledge and use of community capital and resources; and using cultural and indigenous knowledge in health decision making (Nutbeam, 2000; Ratzan, 2001; Zarcadoolas, Pleasant, & Greer, 2002).

2500|$|Poverty {{and poor}} health are {{inseparably}} linked. [...] Poverty has many dimensions – material deprivation (of food, shelter, sanitation, and safe drinking water), social exclusion, lack of education, unemployment, and low income – that {{all work together}} to reduce opportunities, limit choices, undermine hope, and, as a result, threaten health. Poverty {{has been linked to}} higher prevalence of many health conditions, including increased risk of chronic disease, injury, deprived infant development, stress, anxiety, depression, and premature death. According to Loppie and Wien, these health afflictions of poverty most burden outlying groups such as women, children, ethnic minorities, and the disabled. <b>Social</b> <b>determinants</b> of health – like child development, education, living and working conditions, and healthcare- are of special importance to the impoverished.|$|E

40|$|Tuberculosis (TB) -related stigma is an {{important}} <b>social</b> <b>determinant</b> of health. Research generally highlights how stigma can have a considerable impact on individuals and communities, including delays in seeking health care and adherence to treatment. There is scant research into the assessment of TB-related stigma in low incidence countries. This study aimed to systematically map out the research into stigma. A particular {{emphasis was placed on}} the methods employed to measure stigma, the conceptual frameworks used to understand stigma, and whether structural factors were theorized. Twenty-two studies were identified; the majority adopted a qualitative approach and aimed to assess knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about TB. Few studies included stigma as a substantive topic. Only one study aimed to reduce stigma. A number of studies suggested that TB control measures and representations of migrants in the media reporting of TB were implicated in the production of stigma. The paucity of conceptual models and theories about how the <b>social</b> and structural <b>determinants</b> intersect with stigma was apparent. Future interventions to reduce stigma, and measurements of effectiveness, would benefit from a stronger theoretical underpinning in relation to TB stigma and the intersection between the <b>social</b> and structural <b>determinants</b> of health...|$|R
