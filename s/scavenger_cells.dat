When Zanvil Cohn (1926-1993) began studying macrophages in the early 1960s, little was known about them. Immunologists had for decades focused on the chemistry of the second major component of the immune system—the acquired immune response, in which the body produces antibodies in response to exposure to an antigen.

40|$|There are {{at present}} two {{different}} and apparently contradictory theories concerning {{the role of}} nonlymphoid cells, particularly phagocytic macrophages, in the initiation of an immune response. One view is that macrophages have {{an essential role in}} "processing " antigens and "priming " lymphocytes. It has been suggested that macrophages produce either a modified form of the antigen or some form of ribonucleic acid which triggers or even directs the proliferation and differentiation of lymphoid cells. There is considerable evidence suggesting this type of role (10 - 12). The other and equally popular view is that macrophages have no specific role in initiating the immune response, their function being limited to that of a <b>scavenger</b> <b>cell.</b> The essential event in initiating an immune response is held to be the direct interaction of antigen with specific, antibody-like receptors on the lymphocyte surface.

50|$|The {{infection}} of herbivores (and occasionally humans) by the inhalational route normally proceeds as follows: Once the spores are inhaled, they are transported {{through the air}} passages into the tiny air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs. The spores are then picked up by <b>scavenger</b> <b>cells</b> (macrophages) in the lungs and are transported through small vessels (lymphatics) to the lymph nodes in the central chest cavity (mediastinum). Damage caused by the anthrax spores and bacilli to the central chest cavity can cause chest pain and difficulty in breathing. Once in the lymph nodes, the spores germinate into active bacilli that multiply and eventually burst the macrophages, releasing many more bacilli into the bloodstream {{to be transferred to}} the entire body. Once in the blood stream, these bacilli release three proteins named lethal factor, edema factor, and protective antigen. The three are not toxic by themselves, but the combination is incredibly lethal to humans. Protective antigen combines with these other two factors to form lethal toxin and edema toxin, respectively. These toxins are the primary agents of tissue destruction, bleeding, and death of the host. If antibiotics are administered too late, even if the antibiotics eradicate the bacteria, some hosts will still die of toxemia because the toxins produced by the bacilli remain in their system at lethal dose levels.|$|E

The effects, however, that components of the extracellular matrix might have on LDL catabolism by <b>scavenger</b> <b>cells</b> have been little investigated. For these purposes we have prepared insoluble complexes of LDL, heparin, fibronectin, and denatured collagen (gelatin) and examined their effects on lipid accumulation, LDL uptake and degradation, and cholesteryl ester synthesis in mouse peritoneal macrophages. The results of these experiments have demonstrated that the cholesteryl ester content of macrophages incubated with a particular suspension of LDL, heparin, fibronectin, and collagen complexes is four- to fivefold that of cells incubated with LDL alone. The uptake of complexes containing 125 I-LDL is rapid; however, in contrast to either endocytosed 125 I-LDL or 125 I-acetyl LDL, the degradation of complex-derived LDL is impaired. In addition, the uptake of complex-derived LDL stimulates the incorporation of [14 C]oleic acid into cholesteryl oleate, however, the stimulation was {{a small fraction of}} that observed in cells incubated with acetyl LDL. Ultrastructurally, macrophages incubated with LDL, heparin, fibronectin, and collagen complexes did not contain many lipid droplets, but rather their cytoplasm is filled with phagosomes containing material similar in appearance to LDL-matrix complexes.

Source Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Padua, Italy. Abstract Myofibers are reconstituted by the proliferation and fusion of muscle precursor cells when skeletal muscle is injured. One {{of the critical}} events is the peak accumulation of macrophages after 48 hours at the damage site before the satellite cell proliferation. In addition to their well-known role as a <b>scavenger</b> <b>cell,</b> there is now direct evidence of a mitogenic role of macrophages in regenerating muscle. We have utilized an in vitro model to directly investigate and prove that macrophages increase myoblast growth not only of satellite cells, but also of primary myoblasts. Rat muscle {{cells were cultured in}} {{the presence or absence of}} exudate macrophages obtained by peritoneal washing after thioglycollate broth injection. Macrophage coculture increases several times the myoblasts/myotubes yield. This effect is particularly evident in muscle culture conditions in which fibroblast growth is predominant over myoblast proliferation, suggesting a myoblast selective mitogenic effect of macrophages. The results are confirmed by quantitative analyses of both DNA and skeletal muscle-specific-contractile proteins by gel electrophoresis and immunocytochemistry. Experiments with macrophage-conditioned media show this effect is mediated by soluble factors. This growth factor-like activity, which has been shown to be acid-stable and heat-labile, labile, exerts its effects not only on specialized satellite cells during muscle regeneration, but also has a broader mitotic activity on all myogenic cells. In view of the role of muscle regeneration in muscle diseases and of the perspectives offered by gene therapy via myoblasts, we strongly believe that our results open new opportunities in removing many of the clinical constraints associated with repair and cell transplantation.

The focus here {{is on the}} impact of initial spatial localization and substrate diffusivity on the growth of a model microbial consortium consisting of a producer strain that consumes glucose and produces acetate and a scavenger strain that consumes the acetate. The mathematical model is based on an individual cell model where growth is described by Monod kinetics, and substrate transport is described by a continuum-based, non-equilibrium reaction-diffusion model where convective transport is negligible (e. g., in a biofilm). The first set of results focus on a single producer cell {{at the center of the}} domain and surrounded by an initial population of <b>scavenger</b> <b>cells.</b> The impact of the initial population density and substrate diffusivity is examined. A transition is observed from the highest initial density resulting in the greatest cell growth to cell growth being independent of initial density. A high initial density minimizes diffusive transport time and is typically expected to result in the highest growth, but this expected behavior is not predicted in environments with lower diffusivity or larger length scales. When the producer cells are placed on the bottom of the domain with the <b>scavenger</b> <b>cells</b> above in a layered biofilm arrangement, a similar critical transition is observed. For the highest diffusivity values examined, a thin, dense initial scavenger layer is optimal for cell growth.

Since swelling is a well-known inducer of ATP release, and extracellular (ATPe), interacting with P (purinergic) receptors, can affect cell volume (Vr), we explored the dynamic regulation between Vr and ATPe. We made a quantitative assessment of MST 7 -dependent kinetics of Vr and of [ATPe], both in the absence and presence of blockers of ATP efflux, swelling and P receptors. In rbcs 10 μM MST 7 promoted acute, strongly correlated changes in [ATPe] and Vr. Whereas MST 7 induced increases of 10 % in Vr and 190 nM in [ATPe], blocking swelling in a hyperosmotic medium + MST 7 reduced [ATPe] by 40 %. Pre-incubation of rbcs with 10 μM of either carbenoxolone or probenecid, two inhibitors of the ATP conduit pannexin 1, reduced [ATPe] by 40 - 50 % and swelling by 40 - 60 %, while {{in the presence of}} 80 U/mL apyrase, an ATPe <b>scavenger,</b> <b>cell</b> swelling was prevented. While exposure to 10 μM NF 110, a blocker of ATP-P 2 X receptors mediating sodium influx, reduced [ATPe] by 48 %, and swelling by 80 %, incubation of cells in sodium free medium reduced swelling by 92 %. Results were analyzed by means of a mathematical model where ATPe kinetics and Vr kinetics were mutually regulated. Model dependent fit to experimental data showed that, upon MST 7 exposure, ATP efflux required a fast 1960 -fold increase of ATP permeability, mediated by two kinetically different conduits, both of which were activated by swelling and inactivated by time. Both experimental and theoretical results suggest that, following MST 7 exposure, ATP is released via two conduits, one of which is mediated by pannexin 1. The accumulated ATPe activates P 2 X receptors, followed by sodium influx, resulting in cell swelling, which in turn further activates ATP release.

Both chitosan and salicylic acid induced the accumulation of extracellular chitinase, thickening of the cell wall, {{and a variety of}} cytological changes in treated cells. Chitosan also induced the production of a brown pigment and cell death. Both of these effects depended on the availability of reactive oxygen species, because the damage was greatly reduced by either catalase or free-radical <b>scavengers.</b> Pretreating <b>cells</b> with salicylic acid also protected them from the cytotoxic effects of chitosan. This type of induced tolerance persisted when salicylic acid was removed and was not simply due to the release of extracellular substances, because salicylic acid-treated cells did not protect untreated cells from chitosan-induced death. Salicylic acid also stimulated the production of a 10 -kilodalton subtilisin inhibitor that was not produced by chitosan-treated cells. Most of these changes are associated with the hypersensitive response of many plant species, including monocotyledons, and may serve as an in vitro model for investigating the biochemistry of some diseases...|$|R
40|$|A {{procedure}} is described for {{the preparation of}} (S) -dolichol and (S) -nordolichol starting from the polyprenyl fraction extracted from Gingko Biloba integer or exhausted leaves. The procedure appears extremely valuable to obtain the two chiral isoprenoid compounds in good chemical yields and retention of high degree of enantiomeric excess. Also, the (S) -nordolichol represents a good chiral precursor for the preparation of 14 C-labelled (S) -dolichol {{to be used in}} biological investigations on the (S) -dolichol catabolism in the functional living cell. Furthermore, the possible role of (S) -dolichol as a free radical <b>scavenger</b> in the <b>cell</b> membrane was preliminarily evaluated by means of a 1 H-NMR analytical method. Apparently, experimental results substantiate this hypothesis...|$|R
