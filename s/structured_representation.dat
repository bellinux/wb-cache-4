Here we propose to describe images using short <b>structured</b> <b>representations,</b> aiming to capture the crux of a description. These <b>structured</b> <b>representations</b> allow us to tease-out and evaluate separately two types of generalization: standard generalization to new images with similar scenes, and generalization to new combinations of known entities. We compare two learning approaches on the MS-COCO dataset: a state-of-the-art recurrent network based on an LSTM (Show, Attend and Tell), and a simple structured prediction model on top of a deep network. We find that the structured model generalizes to new compositions substantially better than the LSTM, ~ 7 times the accuracy of predicting <b>structured</b> <b>representations.</b> By providing a concrete method to quantify generalization for unseen combinations, we argue that <b>structured</b> <b>representations</b> and compositional splits are a useful benchmark for image captioning, and advocate compositional models that capture linguistic and visual structure...|$|R
25|$|Alternate {{theoretical}} {{approaches to}} syntax make different assumptions regarding {{what is considered}} a constituent. In mainstream phrase structure grammar (and its derivatives), individual words are constituents {{in and of themselves}} as well as being parts of other constituents, whereas in dependency grammar, certain core words in each phrase are not a constituent by themselves, but only members of a phrasal constituent. The following trees show the same sentence in two different theoretical representations, with a phrase <b>structure</b> <b>representation</b> on the left and a dependency grammar representation on the right. In both trees, a constituent is understood to be the entire tree or any labelled subtree (a node plus all the nodes dominated by that node); note that words like killed and with, for instance, form subtrees (and are considered constituents) in the phrase <b>structure</b> <b>representation</b> but not in the dependency <b>structure</b> <b>representation.</b>|$|R

40|$|Similarity {{comparisons}} are a basic component of cognition, {{and there are}} many elegant models of this process. None of these models describe comparisons of <b>structured</b> <b>representations,</b> although mounting evidence suggests that mental representations are well characterized by structured hierarchical systems of relations. We propose that <b>structured</b> <b>representations</b> can be compared via structural alignment, a process derived from models of analogical reasoning. The general prediction of structural alignment is that similarity comparisons lead subjects to attend to the matching relational structure in a pair of items. This prediction is illustrated with a computational simulation that also suggests that the strength of the relational focus is diminished when the relational match is impoverished, or when competing interpretations lead to rich object matches. These claims are tested in four experiments using the one-shot mapping paradigm, which places object similarity and relational similarity in opposition. The results support the hypothesis that similarity involves the alignment of <b>structured</b> <b>representations.</b> © 1993 Academic Press, Inc...|$|R

Language-sensitive editors may impose syntactic correctness as an absolute requirement (e.g., as did Mentor), or may tolerate syntax errors after issuing a warning (e.g., as did the Cornell Program Synthesizer).

FIT posits that [...] "objects are retrieved from scenes by means of selective spatial attention that picks out objects' features, forms feature maps, and integrates those features that are found at the same location into forming objects." [...] Duncan and Humphrey's AET understanding of attention maintained that [...] "there is an initial pre-attentive parallel phase of perceptual segmentation and analysis that encompasses all of the visual items present in a scene. At this phase, descriptions of the objects in a visual scene are generated into structural units; the outcome of this parallel phase is a multiple-spatial-scale <b>structured</b> <b>representation.</b> Selective attention intervenes after this stage to select information that will be entered into visual short-term memory." [...] The contrast of the two theories placed a new emphasis on the separation of visual attention tasks alone and those mediated by supplementary cognitive processes. As Rastophopoulos summarizes the debate: [...] "Against Treisman's FIT, which posits spatial attention as a necessary condition for detection of objects, Humphreys argues that visual elements are encoded and bound together in an initial parallel phase without focal attention, and that attention serves to select among the objects that result from this initial grouping." ...|$|E

40|$|Genome-scale {{metabolic}} reconstructions are {{an important}} resource {{in the study of}} metabolism. They provide both a system and component level view of the biochemical transformations of metabolites. As more reconstructions have been created it remains a challenge to integrate and reason about their contents. This thesis focuses on the development of computational methods to allow on-demand comparison and alignment of metabolic reconstructions. A novel method is introduced that utilises chemical <b>structure</b> <b>representations</b> to identify equivalent metabolites between reconstructions. Using a graph theoretic representation allows the identification and reasoning of metabolites that have a non-exact match. A key advantage is that the method uses the contents of reconstructions directly and does not rely on the creation or use of a common reference. To annotate reconstructions with chemical <b>structure</b> <b>representations</b> an interactive desktop application is introduced. The application assists in the creation and curation of metabolic information using manual, semi-automated, and automated methods. Chemical <b>structure</b> <b>representations</b> can be retrieved, drawn, or generated to allow precise metabolite annotation. In processing chemical information, efficient and optimised algorithms are required. Several areas are addressed and implementations have been contributed to the Chemistry Development Kit. Rings are a fundamental property of chemical structures therefore multiple ring definitions and fast algorithms are explored. Conversion and standardisation between <b>structure</b> <b>representations</b> present a challenge. Efficient algorithms to determine aromaticity, assign a Kekulé form, and generate tautomers are detailed. Many enzymes are selective and specific to stereochemistry.
