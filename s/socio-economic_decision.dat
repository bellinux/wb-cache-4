40|$|Industrial Symbiosis (IS) in an inter-firm {{collaboration}} {{that delivers}} {{both economic and}} environmental benefits. IS can occur when there are local opportunities for the exchange of an underutilized resource, {{this means that the}} exchanged resource is often not a standard product. A non-standard product requires technical expertise and investments in processing equipment or other physical assets. Which in turn puts additional tension on the <b>socio-economic</b> <b>decision</b> making process, because of asset specificity. Thus systems with IS are complex systems, systems with an interplay between socio-economic behaviour and the technical network (Dijkema & Basson 2009). As a consequence, IS attracts scientists from multiple different disciplines. This might explain why there is not yet a widely shared understanding of self-organizing IS (Chertow & Ehrenfeld 2012). All big challenges society phases require inter-disciplinary collaboration.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to reveal some basic {{characteristics}} in social and economic process, and lay the analytic foundation for advance-retreat course (ARC). Design/methodology/approach – The paper presents the analytic model of stochastic ARC (SARC), which is based on the partial distribution and partial process (belonging to the probability theory and stochastic process), and describes some important characteristics of social and economic process in a quantitative method. Findings – The successful socio-economic process, including many biological process, are usually divided into three basic stages: the weak growth, the quick development and the swift decline. In general, rapid growth brings with it the weak persistence, and slow growth brings with it the strong persistence. The socio-economic fluctuations are mainly caused by the excessive environmental pressures. The duration of the socio-economic growth is inverse with the environmental pressure. Research limitations/implications – All the basic variables and parameters in an ARC model should be no less than zero. Practical implications – Based on US GDP (chained) price index data (1940 - 2005), American economic process in recent 70 years is analyzed, and the analysis indicates, American economic motivity is clearly insufficient after 2008, and the present economic recovery will be very arduous and prolonged. Social implications – The environmental pressures will become the main problem for future global socio-economic development. Originality/value – SARC model in this paper presents a special way to analyze the social development and economic growth, and is helpful to related academic research and <b>socio-economic</b> <b>decision</b> making.

40|$|People {{are usually}} confronted with an emotion/deliberation dilemma {{during the course}} of {{judgement}} and decision making, such that an emotional want is at odds with a reasoning- based should/need. Such dilemmas can occur at a social level and be related to others’ welfare. Meanwhile, experience and activities in everyday life can often induce certain mood in people. This means a decision maker may be in a certain mood when confronted with an other-regarding emotion/deliberation dilemma. However, the potential role of mood in judgement and decision making in other-regarding emotion/deliberation dilemmas has been largely unexplored. The purpose of the current thesis is to explore the influence of mood on judgement and decision making in other-regarding emotion/deliberation dilemmas, by looking at whether and how mood affects <b>socio-economic</b> <b>decisions</b> and moral judgement. Treating such emotion/deliberation dilemmas with a dual-process approach, and building on theories of affect that suggest an informational function of mood and mood’s effect on information processing strategy, we propose that mood can affect judgements and decisions in other-regarding emotion/deliberation dilemmas through its informational value. Theoretical and empirical research suggests that mood can influence processing strategy by providing information about the situation (“affect-as-information” approach; Schwarz and Clore, 2007). Positive mood signals that the present situation is non-problematic and in turn encourages the use of a heuristic, top-down, reflexive processing strategy; in contrast, negative mood signals that the present situation is problematic and encourages the use of a more systematic, bottom-up, reflective processing strategy (Clore et al., 2001; Schwarz, 2000, 2002; Schwarz and Clore, 2007). Based on the affect-as-information theorising, we hypothesised that, when confronted with other-regarding emotion/deliberation dilemmas, positive mood would give rise to emotionally compelled judgements and decisions, whereas negative mood would give rise to more cognitively controlled judgements and decisions. To test this idea, three studies were conducted using two experimental paradigms — one pertaining to <b>socio-economic</b> <b>decisions</b> and the other to moral judgement — both of which are assumed to incorporate an other-regarding emotion/deliberation dilemma. Study 1 examined the influence of negative mood on <b>socio-economic</b> <b>decisions</b> using a paradigm called the “mini-ultimatum game” in which the divergence between emotion- and reasoning-based decisions corresponds to that between outcome-focused and intention-considered decisions. Studies 2 and 3 examined influences of positive and negative mood on moral judgement using a moral dilemma paradigm, in which an emotion/deliberation dilemma is posited by the fact that deontological (or, non-utilitarian) choices are at odds with utilitarian choices. Results of Study 1 show that mood did not affect decisions in the mini-ultimatum game. A closer inspection of the behavioural economics literature suggests that this might be caused by a contextual extremity such that outcome plays a dominant role over intention in determining <b>socio-economic</b> <b>decisions.</b> Main results of Studies 2 and 3 indicate that mood may affect moral judgement by providing information about individual moral disposition; thus, whether negative/positive mood is associated with more reasoning-/emotion-based (i. e., utilitarian/non-utilitarian) judgements may be subject to individual moral inclination. Moreover, a pattern that is contrary to the initial thesis hypothesis was obtained from Studies 2 and 3, such that utilitarian judgements tended to increase with positive mood but decrease with negative mood. This suggests that mood may influence moral judgement in a different way from affecting the use of a certain processing strategy. Taken together, our findings, adding to the line of research of judgement and decision making, suggest that mood may affect judgements and decisions in other-regarding emotion/deliberation dilemmas through its informational value, and that its influence (or absence of influence) may be determined by interaction with contextual and dispositional factors. Our findings are discussed in relation to interplays between mood and contextual and dispositional factors, and to mood effects on willpower and on processing scope. They are also thought to have possible implications for legal decision making...|$|R

This article {{presents}} a detailed hydroeconomic modeling tool {{used to assess}} potential economic tradeoffs of alternative water resources management policies and development options under different climate scenarios. The tool leverages the strengths of detailed hydrological, water resources, and economic models to accurately represent the complex and multi-objective physical, management, and <b>socio-economic</b> <b>decision</b> processes in a basin. On the supply side, detailed hydrological and water resources assessment models (including operational Turbine Load Dispatching Models, Short and Long Range Reservoir Management and River Simulation Models, Inflow Forecasting Models, Climate Change Assessment Models, and Scenario/Policy Assessment Models) are used to simulate the spatial and temporal water availability {{in different parts of}} the basin subject to inflow variability and potential climate change, water use withdrawals and returns, and system constraints imposed by different management policies. On the demand side, detailed economic models based on inductive and deductive water valuation techniques are used to derive marginal economic benefit functions for different water use sectors. The tool is applied to the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee- Flint (ACF) basin in the Southeast US (Figure 1) to assess the economic tradeoffs of two alternative water resources management policies under current and potential future climate conditions. The alternative management policies are the Interim Operations Plan (IOP) used by the US Army Corps of Engineers (US ACE) and a new operational plan proposed by Georgakakos, 2010 (GTIOP). Preliminary results (Figure 2) show that (a) GT-IOP clearly outperforms the current ACF water resources management policy under both historical and future climates; and (b) the ACF basin is likely to experience significant water related economic losses due to potential future climate change unless appropriate mitigation measures are implemented.

40|$|The Howard River {{catchment}} covers approximately 1, 500 km 2 in {{the rural}} Darwin region of the Northern Territory (NT). Over the past decade, increased demand from Darwin residents and residential and agricultural development {{in the rural}} Darwin region has increased competition for groundwater, thus generating tensions between different user groups, including those concerned {{about the health of}} groundwater dependent ecosystems. The NT Government is turning to statutory water planning processes to regulate, share and sustain local water resources. In this, it is driven and guided by the national program of water reform introduced by the Council of Australian Governments (COAG), the National Water Initiative (NWI). These water planning processes include mechanisms to guarantee water allocations to the aquatic environment and the water accounting systems to underpin monitoring, trading, environmental and on-farm management. However, water planning in the NT is in its infancy and managers, planners and members of the community face a number of challenges. One of the key questions to arise in water planning is how to allocate scarce water resources {{to meet the needs of}} multiple stakeholders holding multiple and sometimes conflicting objectives. One of the key questions for water planning processes is thus how to explore, weigh and negotiate the different and sometimes competing values and uses for water. This research was thus designed as part of a Commonwealth Government National Heritage Trust project to assist in water planning for the rural Darwin region by trialling social research and <b>socio-economic</b> <b>decision</b> support tools that can help explore and settle trade-offs between competing outcomes. To do this, a combination of methods was used to build understanding of the values, uses and issues for the Howard catchment, explore the conflicts and potential trade-offs, and evaluate several scenarios for the future. These methods included stakeholder consultations and workshops. We brought together a group of stakeholder representatives in a structured and guided process of deliberation and evaluation, called a deliberative multi-criteria evaluation. It was found that there are multiple and sometimes competing values and uses for the water resources of the Howard catchment and a range of existing and emerging conflicts. The deliberative multicriteria evaluation process organised different outcomes for each value and use into scenarios and then enabled information to be shared and positions discussed as the workshop participants evaluated the set of scenarios for the future of the catchment. While there was a range of opinions about the importance of certain criteria to the desired outcome for the catchment there was overwhelming agreement among participants in wanting to see the catchment’s environmental and recreational values maintained and improved. It was also acknowledged that the more likely scenario would include a combination of development and environmental/passive recreational outcomes. Participants concluded that the responsibility for sustainable water use is shared between users, managers and suppliers, and that maintaining environmental and recreational values in the face of population and other pressures will likely require authorities to begin a program of demand management for household water consumption in both the rural and urban regions. They also raised the importance of the need to coordinate land use and water planning. The deliberative multi-criteria evaluation provided a structure for organising values, uses, preferences and scenarios and for participants to hear information from local experts on a range of issues. This information and the ability to ask questions of presenter and talk things through with the other participants dissolved some myths around water use and management in the catchment and from this emerged a new appreciation for the complexity of water planning and management and that responsibility must be shared by all. This kind of outcome, while not easily measurable, may serve to improve stakeholder consultations around future water planning in the NT. As for the effectiveness of the deliberative multi-criteria evaluation in helping to explore, weigh and negotiate the different and sometimes competing values and uses for water in the Howard River catchment, there was a moderate degree of success as described above; however, two factors probably impeded a more effective process. First, a lack of data and modelling limitedthe extent to which the scenarios and evaluation matrix were based on scientific understanding of the key relationships. Second, confusion about the weighting process limited the extent to which participants we able to engage with the scenarios and evaluation matrix. There are solutions for these problems: evaluation matrices can be developed based on better information and the weighting process can be explained more clearly. These learnings will be taken up in the next application of this method. Based on the results of our work we suggest that the NT Government focus attention on gaining and providing more information on: condition of aquatic habitat and populations of aquatic species;new industry in the catchment;risks to water quality; andcondition of terrestrial habitat and populations of terrestrial speciesas the four most important criteria both before and after deliberation. These are the things that people care about and will look at to know how well things are going in the catchment. Our work also shows that providing further information and opportunities for deliberation can improve the level of agreement about what is important; a useful tool for bringing about some level of consensus in a water planning process. This report is primarily for the participants of the workshops and for stakeholders who were contacted throughout the workshop process. It is not a complete report of the project and does not cover a substantial amount of the findings from the literature reviews and stakeholder consultations.

The landscape for international climate services {{and the use of}} climate information in critically important decision-making has evolved significantly {{over the last couple of}} decades. The demand for useful and forward-looking information about climate variability and change across time scales has exploded during this period, as evidenced by a growing focus on climate and risk management/adaptation in many sectors, countries and regions. Stakeholders and decision makers are demanding tangible, actionable information on the impacts of a dynamic climate system on the lives, livelihoods and property of the people and places in which they are vested. Increasingly, meeting these needs has meant the creation of data, contextual <b>socio-economic</b> information, <b>decision</b> support tools and institutional capacity to reduce the negative consequences and take advantage of the positive impacts of variability and change. In addition, the last 10 - 15 years also marks an increasing recognition by institutions with development and resource management mandates (e.g., The World Bank and regional development banks, the World Health Organization) of the need to consider strategic approaches to addressing a dynamic climate system within their relevant sectors (World Bank climate change programs; World Health Organization climate programs).|$|R

The <b>decisions</b> about using contraceptives after each birth are driven by similar covariates, survival status of the previous child, and the family’s gender composition. Birth spacing is driven by contraceptive use and other factors. We find favourable effects of contraceptive use, reducing infant deaths in second and higher order births. Because the mortality risks for first-borns is higher than for later births and contraceptive use reduces the number of higher order births, the net effect on the total infant mortality rate is small. ...|$|R
40|$|Jatropha curcas is a multipurpose, drought-resistant, biofuel tree {{originating}} from Central and South America, but now growing pantropic. The tree produces seeds containing 27 – 40 % inedible oil, which is easily convertible into biodiesel. Although even some basic agronomic characteristics of J. curcas {{are not yet}} fully understood, the plant enjoys a booming interest, which may hold the risk of unsustainable practice. Our qualitative sustainability assessment, focusing on environmental impacts and strengthened by some socio-economic issues, is quite favorable as long as only wastelands or degraded grounds are taken into J. curcas cultivation. Preliminary lifecycle energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) balances are positive, but the GHG balance {{is expected to be}} much dependent on the type of land use which is converted to J. curcas. Removing natural forest will have a severe impact on the global warming potential of the jatropha biodiesel. The cultivation intensity and the distance to markets are expected to have a signifi cant impact on the GHG balance as well. Similar reasoning applies for the impact on soil, water, vegetation structure and biodiversity, although the latter will always depend on local circumstances. Next to biodiesel production and wasteland reclamation, J. curcas also hosts socio-economic development potential.

Results: Intentions, ICK and AR were all predictors of FOBT uptake; however, for people who expressed strong intentions to return their FOBT kit, only ICK differentiated kit returners from non-returners, with non-returners reporting higher disgust (mean difference= 0. 51; 95 % CI for difference (0. 37, 0. 64), Cohen’s d= 0. 34). The 4 -item ICK-C showed excellent internal reliability and predictive validity with regard to an objective measure i. e., FOBT uptake. Conclusions: The findings show that perceived disgust is an important emotional psychological construct in determining uptake of colorectal cancer screening. We also demonstrated that a simple 4 -item scale (the ‘ICK-C), developed to be used in research on colorectal cancer screening, has excellent psychometric properties...|$|R

They are also heavily exploited and are currently the focus of numerous ecosystem-based management exercises. Over {{the past ten years}} there has been increasing enthusiasm for marine protected areas (MPAs) as a tool for pelagic conservation. However, there remains almost a complete absence of systematic conservation planning in the pelagic realm, both within exclusive economic zones and the high seas. Here we demonstrate the use of a decision support system to guide the implementation of MPAs that consider the physical and biological dynamics typical of the pelagic realm, and propose a method for integrative planning for pelagic and benthic conservation in the Southern Benguela ecosystem. Our approach was to maximize the representation of threatened species and key fisheries species within MPAs closed to fishing. In addition to representation, we consider MPA design to address the dynamics of the system using time series data of key oceanographic characteristics and abundance of small pelagic fish. We also discuss problems associated with offshore conservation, where the features of interest are ephemeral and dynamic. Our approach explicitly involves stakeholders and we incorporate <b>socio-economic</b> data into <b>decision</b> support tools...|$|R
40|$|Participation in the {{informal}} land market by farmers is always common in land scarce rural Bangladesh {{in response to}} failure of implementation of administratively based land reform system to meet increasing demand for cultivable land and to minimize discrepancy in distribution of factors at the farm level. The objective {{of the present study}} is to jointly determine the <b>socio-economic</b> factors underlying <b>decision</b> to lease-in or lease-out land and conditional on these decisions, tenant-land lord's choice of accepting and offering of share versus fixed rent contracts in rural Bangladesh agriculture. The focus is on the risk averseness and moral hazard problem for tenant land lord respectively. An empirical model of contract choice for both parties (tenants and land lords) is compared against a data set from a sample survey of IRRI and finds a mixed evidence of risk averseness among tenants and moral hazard problem among land lords. However, we find attributes of the land lord plays more important part to offer either a sharecropping contract or fixed rent contract than tenant's attributes to choose a contract between two alternatives. This indicates a monopoly power of land lords in Bangladesh in {{the informal}} tenancy market. Farm Management,...|$|R
40|$|The aim: {{the article}} {{describes}} the paternalistic relationship as determinants of corruption. Method of work: the Dialectical method to {{the knowledge of the}} social phenomena made it possible to analyze corruption and paternalistic relations as determinants of its manifestations in the contemporary socio-cultural landscape, the phenomenological method facilitated distinction of corruption in society. Results: the Existence of paternalistic relations in society mediates the proliferation of corruption phenomena in the society, which leads to waste of public funds and property, mismanagement of public goods, the suppression of entrepreneurial activity, reduce the quality of goods and services, increasing social differentiation of the population, undermine the democratic foundations of society, the diminution of credibility and confidence in the state from society, the weakening of the managerial capacity of the state apparatus, the inhibition of the socio-political, <b>socio-economic</b> and management <b>decisions.</b> The scope of the results: the basic provisions and conclusions of the article can be used in scientific, pedagogical and practical activities in the examination and analysis of the transformations of different social relations taking place in modern times, including {{from the point of view}} of corrupt behaviour...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} aims {{to evaluate the}} usefulness of the application of Life Cycle Management in the agricultural sector focusing on the environmental and <b>socio-economic</b> aspects of <b>decision</b> making in the Colombian cocoa production. Such appraisal is based on the application of two methodological tools: Life Cycle Assessment, which considers environmental impacts throughout the life cycle of the cocoa production system, and Taguchi Loss Function, which measures the economic impact of a process' deviation from production targets. Results show that appropriate improvements in farming practices and supply consumption can enhance decision-making in the agricultural cocoa sector towards sustainability. In terms of agri-business purposes, such qualitative shift allows not only meeting consumer demands for environmentally friendly products, but also increasing the productivity and competitiveness of cocoa production, all of which has helped Life Cycle Management gain global acceptance. Since farmers have an important role in improving social and economic indicators at the national level, more attention should be paid to the upgrading of their cropping practices. Finally, one fundamental aspect of national cocoa production is the institutional and governmental support available for farmers in face of socio-economic or technological needs...|$|R

The low-lying Kenyan coast is vulnerable to these hazards, therefore modeling their eff ects is necessary for understanding their <b>socio-economic</b> impacts. A <b>Decision</b> Support Tool (DST) was developed to study the hydrodynamics along the Kenyan coast. The bathymetry grid for the DST was created using Arc View GIS from nau cal charts. MIKE 21 Hydrodynamic Module (HD) Demo version was used to organize the bathymetry and enforce boundary condi ons for ELCOM simula on. Tidal data was obtained from both the Kenya Meteorological Department’s dal gauges and the GLOSS sta on. The computed de and currents from ELCOM were validated using graphical and sta s cal comparison. Their predic ve ability was analyzed. The ELCOM water levels and currents compared well to observed values, and their dominant signals were detectable. ELCOM could, therefore, simulate and forecast coastal hydrody-namics. This DST can assist the Government in opera onal forecas ng for marine environmental protec on, resources management and disaster risk reduc on and mi ga on as well as infrastructure mapping and de-velopment along the Kenyan coast...|$|R
40|$|Forests provide {{ecosystem}} services jointly with timber production. In some cases, private forest owners implement management actions {{in order to}} enhance the provision of such services. They may get direct benefits from this decision such as private amenity values or effects on (e. g., hunting), they may have altruist traits in their utility function for providing public goods (e. g., biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration), or they may be incited for by a public authority and compensated for the costs. Specifically, this paper focuses on the decision of setting aside forest land. It raises the more general question of the efficiency of multiple-use vs. specialized management of forest lands. We propose an econometric analysis to identify factors of the set-aside choice and to measure the impact of this decision on forest management costs. A flexible cost function is modelled and estimated for both types of management. The percentages of old/mature deciduous and old/mature coniferous forests are used as biodiversity and carbon indicators. Results show that the set-aside choice depends on the landowners’ income and on their <b>socio-economic</b> characteristics. Set-aside <b>decision</b> has a significant and positive impact on the management costs. This implies that the additional private and public benefits achieved from specialized relative to multiple-use management should exceed this cost premium...|$|R
40|$|The {{rehabilitation}} of contaminated sites involves several considerations {{in terms of}} environmental, technological and <b>socio-economic</b> aspects. A <b>decision</b> support system becomes therefore {{necessary in order to}} manage problem complexity and to define effective rehabilitation interventions. DESYRE (Decision Support sYstem for Rehabilitation of contaminated sites) is a software system which integrates risk assessment with socio-economic analysis and technological assessment in order to provide decision-makers with different remediation scenarios to be evaluated. The structure of the system allows a subsequent analysis, from socioeconomic analysis and site characterization, to risk assessment before and after remediation technologies selection, until the definition of remediation scenarios. The system integrates several analytical tools, such as geostatistics, Fuzzy logic, risk assessment and geographical information systems (GIS). The present paper focuses {{on the role of the}} Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), which represents the core of the DSS. In the DESYRE framework, MCDA is applied for the definition of the pool of the suitable remediation technologies. The analytic hierarchy process is applied to rank technologies and develop alternative remediation scenarios. The scenarios are described by a set of indices which can be aggregated by decision makers to rank alternative options. Future research developments suggest the MCDA application also for the evaluation of the remediation scenarios by different stakeholders, in a Group Decision Making (GDM) context...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was aimed to assess the dietary intake in {{pregnant}} women aged 18 - 45 year. A sample of 200 respondents was selected through simple random sampling technique from four urban areas of District Faisalabad and 50 respondents were selected randomly from each area. A well structured interviewing schedule was utilized to collect the data. Analysis was conducted through Descriptive and Bi-variate methods and Gamma and chi-square tests were applied {{to examine the relationship}} between variables. Maximum numbers of respondents were of age up to 30 years and 12 years schooling was reported by about 42. 5 % respondents. Huge majority 77. 5 % of the respondents were taking balance diet during pregnancy, 40. 0 % of the respondent suffered in anemia and 85. 0 % of the respondents were using multi vitamins during pregnancy. Strategies and policies to enhance women education to make them independent in <b>socio-economic</b> and cultural <b>decisions</b> are required to have profound impact on their health. Public health awareness campaigns are required to be launched to make people aware about the benefits of small family, prenatal and postnatal care in the form of better food provision and vitamins and utilization of health facilities in the context of women general reproductive health...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} object-based image {{analysis}} (OBIA) techniques {{were applied to}} assess land cover changes related to mineral extraction in a conflict-affected area of the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) {{over a period of}} five years based on very high resolution (VHR) satellite data of different sensors. Object-based approaches explicitly consider spatio-temporal aspects which allow extracting important information to document mining activities. The use of remote sensing data as an independent, up-to-date and reliable data source provided hints on the general development of the mining sector in relation to <b>socio-economic</b> and political <b>decisions.</b> While in early 2010, the situation was still characterised by an intensification of mineral extraction, a mining ban between autumn 2010 and spring 2011 marked the starting point for a continuous decrease of mining activities. The latter can be substantiated through a decrease in the extend of the mining area {{as well as of the}} number of dwellings in the nearby settlement. A following demilitarisation and the mentioned need for accountability with respect to the origin of certain minerals led to organised, more industrialized exploitation. This development is likewise visible on satellite imagery as typical clearings within forested areas. The results of the continuous monitoring in turn facilitate non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to further foster the mentioned establishment of responsible supply chains by the mining industry throughout the entire period of investigation...|$|R
40|$|Grassland bird habitat has {{declined}} substantially in the United States. Remaining grasslands are increasingly fragmented, mostly privately owned, and vary greatly {{in terms of}} habitat quality and protection status. A coordinated strategic response for grassland bird conservation is difficult, {{largely due to the}} scope and complexity of the problem, further compounded by biological, sociological, and economic uncertainties. We describe the results from a collaborative Structured Decision Making (SDM) workshop focused on linking social and economic drivers of landscape change to grassland bird population outcomes. We identified and evaluated alternative strategies for grassland bird conservation using a series of rapid prototype models. We modeled change in grassland and agriculture cover in hypothetical landscapes resulting from different landowner decisions in response to alternative <b>socio-economic</b> conservation policy <b>decisions.</b> Resulting changes in land cover at all three stages of the annual cycle (breeding, wintering, and migration) were used to estimate changes in grassland bird populations. Our results suggest that successful grassland bird conservation may depend upon linkages with ecosystem services on working agricultural lands and grassland-based marketing campaigns to engage the public. With further development, spatial models that link landowner decisions with biological outcomes can be essential tools for making conservation policy decisions. A coordinated non-traditional partnership will likely be necessary to clearly understand and systematically respond to the many conservation challenges facing grassland birds...|$|R
