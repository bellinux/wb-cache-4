5|$|After death, {{the empty}} <b>shell</b> of this sea snail {{is often used}} by hermit crabs. On {{the coast of the}} Caraguatatuba, Brazil, a study of <b>shell</b> use in the diogenid hermit crab species Isocheles sawayai was carried out. This study {{revealed}} that 11.5% of the population of these hermit crabs were using shells of Semicassis granulata. The occupation of <b>shell</b> type was reported as not being random, but was instead described as being influenced by the weight, size, shape and internal volume of the <b>shell,</b> the occurrence of epibionts such as bryozoans on the <b>shell,</b> and the degree of resistance the <b>shell</b> offered to predation and desiccation.|$|E
5|$|Both sides cite strong evidence, and the {{conflict}} {{has yet to}} be resolved. The <b>shell</b> of testudines distinguishes them from other vertebrates. The <b>shell</b> is not an exoskeleton, but a modified ribcage and part of the vertebral column. Because of the <b>shell,</b> the pectoral and pelvic girdles are located within the ribcage. The limb bones are also modified to accommodate to the <b>shell.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1965, in the US, the Scotch Bonnet <b>shell</b> {{was named}} {{as a state}} symbol of North Carolina, the first {{designation}} of a US state <b>shell.</b>|$|E
50|$|Other display {{introduces}} detail classification, {{characteristics and}} items of special interest, {{as well as}} introduce the habitat and distribution of different of <b>shells,</b> for example, scallop <b>shells,</b> thorny oysters, nautilus <b>shells,</b> volutes <b>shells,</b> cowries, dangerous (poisonous) <b>shells,</b> mitres and murex <b>shells</b> and their relatives.|$|R
5000|$|Juvenile cowry <b>shells</b> {{are not at}} all {{similar to}} adult cowry <b>shells.</b> The {{juvenile}} <b>shells</b> of cowries perhaps more closely resemble the <b>shells</b> of some [...] "bubble snails" [...] in the order Cephalaspidea. Also the <b>shells</b> of juvenile cowries seldom exhibit the same color patterns as the adult <b>shells</b> do, and thus can be hard to identify to species.|$|R
50|$|Apart from mollusk <b>shells,</b> other <b>shells</b> {{that can}} be found on beaches are those of barnacles, {{horseshoe}} crabs and brachiopods. Marine annelid worms in the family Serpulidae create <b>shells</b> which are tubes made of calcium carbonate cemented onto other surfaces. The <b>shells</b> of sea urchins are called tests, and the moulted <b>shells</b> of crabs and lobsters are called exuviae. While most seashells are external, some cephalopods have internal <b>shells.</b>|$|R
5|$|In theory, {{if enough}} {{satellites}} were created and deployed around their star, they would compose a non-rigid {{version of the}} Dyson <b>shell</b> mentioned below. Such a <b>shell</b> would not suffer from the drawbacks of massive compressive pressure, nor are the mass requirements of such a <b>shell</b> {{as high as the}} rigid form. Such a <b>shell</b> would, however, have the same optical and thermal properties as the rigid form, and would be detected by searchers in a similar fashion (see below).|$|E
5|$|The {{frame was}} {{strengthened}} and made longer {{to handle a}} 12 gauge -inch <b>shell,</b> {{as well as the}} -inch <b>shell.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>shell</b> of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is ovate, slender, acute, and of {{moderate}} thickness. The <b>shell</b> suture is deep. The spire is gently convex, laterally compressed, with 3¼ whorls. The spire is long, {{slightly less than}} half the <b>shell</b> length, and the aperture is very oblique. The <b>shell</b> color is subtranslucent, calcareous pale yellow to white. The surface is somewhat glossy and marked with growth wrinkles and lines. The size varies somewhat, but adult specimens of the type lot averaged 20.9millimeters (mm) in <b>shell</b> length. Various adult specimens measured during the summer of 1981 and 1982 ranged from 19 to 24mm.|$|E
40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the geometrically non-linear theory of 6 -parametric elastic <b>shells</b> with drilling degrees of freedom. This theory establishes a general model for <b>shells,</b> which is characterized by two independent kinematic fields: the translation vector and the rotation tensor. Thus, the kinematical structure of 6 -parameter <b>shells</b> is identical to that of Cosserat <b>shells.</b> We show the existence of global minimizers for the geometrically non-linear 2 D equations of elastic <b>shells.</b> The proof of the existence theorem is based on the direct methods of the calculus of variations using essentially the convexity of the energy in the strain and curvature measures. Since our result is valid for general anisotropic <b>shells,</b> we analyze separately the particular cases of isotropic <b>shells,</b> orthotropic <b>shells,</b> and composite <b>shells...</b>|$|R
50|$|The term seashell is also applied loosely to mollusk <b>shells</b> {{that are}} not of marine origin, for example by people walking the shores of lakes and rivers using the term for the {{freshwater}} mollusk <b>shells</b> they encounter. Seashells purchased from tourist shops or dealers may include various freshwater and terrestrial <b>shells</b> as well. Non-marine items offered may include large and colorful tropical land snail <b>shells,</b> freshwater apple snail <b>shells,</b> and pearly freshwater unionid mussel <b>shells.</b> This can be confusing to collectors, as non-marine <b>shells</b> are often not included in their reference books.|$|R
30|$|This section {{presents}} the experimental buckling obtained with {{three types of}} <b>shells</b> subjected to uniform external pressure, axial compression {{or a combination of}} the two. The <b>shells</b> were either smooth cylinders (the reference <b>shells)</b> or ASTER <b>shells.</b>|$|R
5|$|The <b>shell</b> of Theodoxus fluviatilis is {{somewhat}} depressed (with an usually low spire), strongly calcified, and has 3–3.5 whorls (including the protoconch). Larger specimens are usually eroded. The width {{of an adult}} <b>shell</b> is usually 5–9mm, but can reach up to 11–13mm. The height of the <b>shell</b> is 4–6.5mm, or up to 7mm. These mean values vary among populations depending on the environment: the maximum width of the <b>shell</b> of brackish water populations is 9.3mm. Brackish water shells are somewhat shorter, reaching up to 5.8mm, and the maximum weight of the <b>shell</b> is 124mg. In freshwater populations, the maximum recorded <b>shell</b> width is 13.1mm, and maximum height is 9.3mm. The maximum weight of freshwater shells is 343mg.|$|E
5|$|The {{shells of}} Amphidromus are {{relatively}} large, {{from one to}} three inches high, and colorful. Amphidromus has an elongate-conic or ovate-conic helicoid <b>shell</b> of 5 to 8 whorls. The <b>shell</b> may be thin and fragile, or very heavy and solid, with no known correlation of <b>shell</b> structure with distribution or habitats.|$|E
5|$|The {{stability}} of the 6s <b>shell</b> {{is due to the}} presence of a filled 4f <b>shell.</b> An f <b>shell</b> poorly screens the nuclear charge that increases the attractive Coulomb interaction of the 6s <b>shell</b> and the nucleus (see lanthanide contraction). The absence of a filled inner f <b>shell</b> is the reason for the somewhat higher melting temperature of cadmium and zinc, although both these metals still melt easily and, in addition, have unusually low boiling points.|$|E
50|$|Camaenid <b>shells</b> {{are often}} quite large (25-50 mm), {{but a number}} of species also have small <b>shells</b> (<5 mm). <b>Shells</b> reveal a {{remarkable}} diversity in shape and colour, which is partly linked with their lifestyle. For instance, arboreal species tend to have large and conical <b>shells,</b> whereas terrestrial species often have rather flat <b>shells.</b> The <b>shells</b> of some taxa can be vividly coloured, showing banding or other conspicuous patterns, but others are plain and uniform.|$|R
50|$|The term {{aperture}} is {{used for}} the main opening in gastropod <b>shells,</b> scaphopod <b>shells,</b> and also for Nautilus and ammonite <b>shells.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2014 {{researchers}} encapsulated silicon nanoparticles inside carbon <b>shells,</b> {{and then}} encapsulated clusters of the <b>shells</b> with more carbon. The <b>shells</b> provide enough room inside {{to allow the}} nanoparticles to swell and shrink without damaging the <b>shells,</b> improving durability.|$|R
5|$|Whereas {{all other}} group 8 {{elements}} have 2 electrons in the outermost <b>shell,</b> in ruthenium, the outermost <b>shell</b> {{has only one}} electron (the final electron is in a lower <b>shell).</b> This anomaly is observed in the neighboring metals niobium (41), molybdenum (42), and rhodium (45).|$|E
5|$|Actinides {{have similar}} {{properties}} to lanthanides. The 6d and 7s electronic shells are filled in actinium and thorium, and the 5f <b>shell</b> is being filled with further increase in atomic number; the 4f <b>shell</b> is {{filled in the}} lanthanides. The first experimental evidence for the filling of the 5f <b>shell</b> in actinides was obtained by McMillan and Abelson in 1940. As in lanthanides (see lanthanide contraction), the ionic radius of actinides monotonically decreases with atomic number (see also Aufbau principle).|$|E
5|$|After Urus {{release and}} Uru Lives demise, Cyan {{announced}} that new content would be added via expansion packs. The first, Uru: To D'ni, added the never-released Uru Live online content, thus {{focusing on the}} past of the D'ni. Uru: The Path of the <b>Shell,</b> extended the story of Uru {{in the present and}} added multiple never-before-seen Ages. Unlike the first expansion pack, Uru: The Path of the <b>Shell</b> was not free, but was boxed and sold in stores. Uru, To Dni, and The Path of the <b>Shell</b> were also packaged together and sold as Uru: The Complete Chronicles.|$|E
50|$|Empty serpulid <b>shells</b> can {{sometimes}} {{be confused with the}} <b>shells</b> of a family of marine gastropod mollusks, the Vermetidae or worm snails. The most obvious difference is that serpulid <b>shells</b> are dull inside, whereas the molluscan vermetid <b>shells</b> are shiny inside.|$|R
50|$|Initially, {{there were}} no special sea target <b>shells,</b> instead, regular {{fragmentation}} <b>shells</b> were used with timed, immediate and delayed fuses for differences in desired effect. A first attempt to develop sea target <b>shells</b> failed in the 1980s, with the company going bankrupt. A fresh start {{was done in the}} beginning of the 1990s for payload <b>shells</b> similar to some anti-tank <b>shells.</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} averaged <b>shelling</b> {{and coordination}} numbers of aperiodic tilings. <b>Shelling</b> numbers count the vertices on radial <b>shells</b> around a vertex. Coordination numbers, in turn, count the vertices on coordination <b>shells</b> of a vertex, defined via the graph distance {{given by the}} tiling. For the Ammann-Beenker tiling, we find that coordination <b>shells</b> consist of complete <b>shelling</b> orbits, which enables us to calculate averaged coordination numbers for rather large distances explicitly. The relation to topological invariants of tilings is briefly discussed...|$|R
5|$|Also if {{assuming}} a radius of one AU, then {{there may not}} be sufficient building material in the Solar System to construct a Dyson <b>shell.</b> Anders Sandberg estimates that there is 1.82 kg of easily usable building material in the Solar System, enough for a 1-AU <b>shell</b> with a mass of 600kg/m2—about 8–20cm thick on average, depending on the density of the material. This includes the hard-to-access cores of the gas giants; the inner planets alone provide only 11.79 kg, enough for a 1-AU <b>shell</b> with a mass of just 42kg/m2.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the exact}} {{size of the}} two outer CO shells remains elusive, {{preliminary}} estimates suggest that one <b>shell</b> extends from about 1.5 to 4.0 arcseconds and the other expands as far as 7.0 arcseconds. Assuming the Jovian orbit of 5.5AU as the star radius, the inner <b>shell</b> would extend roughly 50 to 150 stellar radii (~300 to 800AU) with the outer one as far as 250 stellar radii (~1400AU). The Sun's heliopause is estimated at about 100 AU, so {{the size of this}} outer <b>shell</b> would be almost fourteen {{times the size of the}} Solar System.|$|E
5|$|As {{a benefit}} from the system's design, most tasks in Plan 9 can be {{accomplished}} by using ls, cat, grep, cp and rm utilities in combination with the rc <b>shell</b> (the default Plan 9 <b>shell).</b>|$|E
40|$|We derive {{formulas}} for {{whispering gallery mode}} resonances and bending {{losses in}} infinite cylindrical dielectric <b>shells</b> and sets of concentric cylindrical <b>shells.</b> The formulas also apply to spherical <b>shells</b> and to sections of bent waveguides. The derivation {{is based on a}} Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) treatment of Helmholtz equation and can in principle be extended to any number of concentric <b>shells.</b> A distinctive limit analytically arises in the analysis when two <b>shells</b> are brought at very close distance to one another. In that limit, the two <b>shells</b> act as a slot waveguide. If the two <b>shells</b> are sufficiently apart, we identify a structural resonance between the individual <b>shells,</b> which can either lead to a substantial enhancement or suppression of radiation losses.

50|$|During the First World War, {{shrapnel}} <b>shells</b> and explosive <b>shells</b> inflicted terrible {{casualties on}} infantry, accounting for nearly 70% of all war casualties and {{leading to the}} adoption of steel helmets on both sides. <b>Shells</b> filled with poison gas were used from 1917 onwards. Frequent problems with <b>shells</b> led to many military disasters when <b>shells</b> failed to explode, most notably during the 1916 Battle of the Somme.|$|R
50|$|The player's {{currency}} of Gold <b>Shells</b> to Pink <b>Shells</b> to Green <b>Shells</b> changed after GoPets discovered {{a flaw in}} their fortune cookie system which gave a higher payout of gold <b>shells</b> than a person who would buy the prepaid cards. Due to this, GoPets changed and revised the fortune cookie system making a daily maximum payout of 10 Gold <b>Shells</b> from pink fortune cookies.|$|R
5|$|At 14:47, an unexploded 24-cm <b>shell</b> was reported. The <b>shell</b> {{crashed through}} the port bow {{directly}} below the Wardroom {{and entered the}} stateroom of Warrant Officer M.A. Clark, but failed to explode. The unexploded <b>shell</b> was later disarmed by a Navy bomb disposal officer in Portsmouth and is currently displayed aboard the ship. Throughout the three-hour duel, the Germans straddled and near-missed Texas over sixty-five times, but she continued her mission firing 206 14-inch shells at Battery Hamburg until ordered to retire at 15:01.|$|E

40|$|The spherically {{symmetric}} thin <b>shells</b> of the barotropic fluids {{with the}} linear {{equation of state}} are considered {{within the framework of}} general relativity. We study several aspects of the <b>shells</b> as completely relativistic models of stars, first of all the neutron stars and white dwarfs, and circumstellar <b>shells.</b> The exact equations of motion of the <b>shells</b> are obtained. Also we calculate the parameters of the equilibrium configurations, including the radii of static <b>shells.</b> Finally, we study the stability of the <b>shells</b> against radial perturbations...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an {{experimental study of}} imperfection insensitive composite wavy cylindrical <b>shells</b> subject to axial compression. A fabrication technique for making cylindrical <b>shells</b> with intricate shape of cross-sections has been developed. A photogrammetry technique to measure the geometric imperfections has also been developed. The behavior of the wavy <b>shells</b> under axial compression was predicted through simulations and measured through compression tests. Both the analyses and experiments have confirmed that the wavy <b>shells</b> are imperfection insensitive. Comparisons between the wavy <b>shells</b> and circular <b>shells</b> have also confirmed that introducing optimal symmetry-breaking wavy cross-sections can significantly reduce the imperfection sensitivity and improve the load-bearing capability of cylindrical <b>shells...</b>|$|R
