5|$|Flanders and his brother, Ernest, were {{instrumental}} in developing <b>screw</b> <b>thread</b> grinding machines. These incorporated advances in thread technology (furthered by the Hartness optical comparator) and Flanders’s engineering calculations for gear-cutting machinery. In 1946, the two brothers received the Edward Longstreth Medal of the Franklin Institute as recognition of this accomplishment. They had improved the accurate manufacture of die-cut screws in soft metal and solved the problem of thread-grinding on hardened work.|$|E

These are more reliable than A-clamps because the O-ring is well protected, but many countries do not use DIN fittings widely on compressors, or cylinders which have DIN fittings, so a diver traveling abroad with a DIN system may need to take an adaptor, either for connecting the DIN regulator to a rented cylinder, or for connecting an A-clamp filler hose to a DIN cylinder valve.|$|E

25|$|Threading is {{the process}} of {{creating}} a <b>screw</b> <b>thread.</b> More screw threads are produced each year than any other machine element. There are many methods of generating threads, including subtractive methods (many kinds of thread cutting and grinding, as detailed below); deformative or transformative methods (rolling and forming; molding and casting); additive methods (such as 3D printing); or combinations thereof.|$|E
25|$|Joseph Whitworth was an {{engineer}} and inventor who hailed from Stockport, Cheshire (now Greater Manchester). A talented mechanic amongst various other engineering roles, {{for long periods of}} his life, he worked in factories in Manchester. Whitworth would ultimately devise a standard <b>screw</b> <b>thread</b> system, {{the first of its kind}} in the world. The system he created in 1841 would become known as the British Standard Whitworth.|$|E
25|$|His life {{achievements}} {{were recognized}} with honorary {{degrees from the}} University of Vermont (ME in 1910 and LLD in 1920) and Yale University (MA in 1914).

In the same year the American Philosophical Society and the City Trusts of Philadelphia awarded the John Scott Medal to Hartness for the flat turret lathe, citing its usefulness in making artillery.|$|E

40|$|Fine <b>screw</b> <b>threads</b> {{are widely}} used for the bolted joints under severe running conditions. It {{is well known that}} they are {{effective}} to prevent thread loosening due to fine pitch. As for other mechanical characteristics, it has been reported in the previous paper using complex stress functions that the stress concentration at bolt thread root is higher than coarse <b>screw</b> <b>threads</b> and the fatigue strength of threaded fasteners shows a minimum value for varying pitch. However, the latter is questionable since the calculations were conducted under lots of hypotheses. In this study, stress concentration and stress amplitude along thread root are evaluated by three-dimensional finite element analysis, in which numerical models of the bolted joints are constructed so as to accurately represent the effect of thread helical geometry. It is shown that the stress concentration at thread root of fine <b>screw</b> <b>threads</b> is higher than that of coarse <b>screw</b> <b>threads,</b> and the maximum stress amplitude is likely to be lower on the contrary. Meanwhile, it is sometimes recognized that clamping forces of fine <b>screw</b> <b>threads</b> are smaller comparing to those of coarse <b>screw</b> <b>threads</b> when tightened with same torque. To clarify this contradictory phenomenon, tightening experiments are conducted, and it is found that the difference of the energy needed for tightening <b>screw</b> <b>threads</b> is found to be the major cause. 1...|$|R

25|$|TNT {{is prone}} to {{exudation}} of dinitrotoluenes and other isomers of trinitrotoluene. Even small quantities of such impurities can cause such effect. The effect shows especially in projectiles containing TNT and stored at higher temperatures, e.g. during summer. Exudation of impurities leads to formation of pores and cracks (which in turn cause increased shock sensitivity). Migration of the exudated liquid into the fuze <b>screw</b> <b>thread</b> can form fire channels, increasing the risk of accidental detonations; fuze malfunction can result from the liquids migrating into its mechanism. Calcium silicate is mixed with TNT to mitigate the tendency towards exudation.|$|E
25|$|The {{center of}} the bit is a tapered <b>screw</b> <b>thread.</b> This screws into the wood as the bit is turned, and pulls the bit into the wood. There {{is no need for}} any force to push the bit into the workpiece, only the torque to turn the bit. This is ideal for a bit for a hand tool. The radial cutting edges remove a slice of wood of {{thickness}} equal to the pitch of the central screw for each rotation of the bit. To pull the bit from the hole, either the female thread in the wood workpiece must be stripped, or the rotation of the bit must be reversed.|$|E
25|$|The balance {{consisted}} of a circular steel balance wheel with two bimetallic strips attached diametrically. Each bimetallic strip terminated with a <b>screw</b> <b>thread</b> mounted with a weight or balance nut. The further along the strip this nut was screwed, the greater the compensating effect. Another part of the patent concerned an addition to {{the form of the}} balance spring—a coil of smaller radius {{at each end of the}} helical spring, which offered increasing resistance to the rotating balance as it turned towards the end of each vibration. This was an important invention, as it largely eliminated the problem of the positional adjustment of balance controlled watches. This device, known as the Overcoil balance spring is still used today in most precision mechanical watches.|$|E
