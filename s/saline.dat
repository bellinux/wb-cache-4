5|$|In {{two small}} studies of two {{patients}} and another with one patient suffering from recurrent CSF leaks where repeated blood patches failed to form clots and relieve symptoms, the patients received temporary but complete resolution of symptoms with an epidural <b>saline</b> infusion. The <b>saline</b> infusion temporarily restores the volume {{necessary for a}} patient to avoid SIH until the leak can be repaired properly. Intrathecal <b>saline</b> infusion is used in urgent cases such as intractable pain or decreased consciousness.|$|E

50|$|The {{southern}} Illinois <b>salines</b> {{were the}} first major industry in the Illinois Territory following European settlement. The <b>salines,</b> where brine was boiled down into salt, were financially successful, and became {{the property of the}} State of Illinois upon its statehood in 1818. Although Illinois was legally a free state, an exemption in the Illinois Constitution allowed slavery at the Illinois <b>Salines</b> and other salt springs near Shawneetown; this exception was made because the slave-operated <b>salines</b> contributed one-third of the new state's yearly revenue. The law allowed African slaves to be imported to the site until 1825, when the exemption expired. However, indentured servitude at the springs continued past this point. Salt production continued until 1870, when competition from West Virginia salt mines drove the springs out of business.|$|R

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} debut of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, M-11 was {{designated}} from M-50 at Napoleon to US112 in <b>Saline.</b> The last section of this highway was fully paved between Bridgewater and <b>Saline</b> in late 1948 or early 1949. In the middle of 1954, M-92 was extended southward from Chelsea to Manchester. From there, that highway replaced M-11 west to Bridgewater before turning south to Clinton; at the same time, the remainder of M-11 {{was removed from the}} state highway system and the designation was decommissioned.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{remarkable}} {{significance of}} Pantanal {{for the conservation}} of aquatic birds, the status of their populations, the spatiotemporal patterns of distribution and habitat use and structure of communities are little known. Thus, we studied three aquatic environments (Negro river, bays and <b>salines)</b> from 2007 to 2009 in the Nhecol&# 226;ndia Pantanal to verify the distribution and composition of aquatic birds and also if there is significant seasonal influence on these aspects. We adopted the transect method (288 hours of sampling) and recorded 135 species (7. 834 individuals). The Negro river showed the highest diversity, while the <b>salines</b> the lowest. The similarity of aquatic bird communities was higher between bays and <b>salines,</b> followed by Negro river and bays and lower between <b>salines</b> and Negro river. The equidistribution is more variable in the <b>salines</b> and more stable in the Negro river. The environments strongly differ from each other in aquatic bird composition in space (habitat use and distribution) and time (seasonal water fluctuations). The diversity of bird community in the dry season varies significantly in the <b>salines,</b> followed by the bays and more stable in the Negro river. The Negro river, regardless of large annual amplitude of flow, is more seasonally stable since its riparian vegetation is continuous (not isolated) and constant. These aspects provide better conditions to stay all year, contributing to decrease the seasonal nomadic tendencies of aquatic birds. Finally, all these data provide strong arguments to the preservation of all phytophysiognomies in the Nhecol&# 226;ndia sub- region of Pantanal, but with special attention to the <b>salines</b> widely used by many flocks of aquatic birds (mainly in the dry season) and migrant and/or rare species restricted to this habitat...|$|R

5|$|In Washtenaw County, US12 {{passes through}} Benton {{in a rural}} {{southern}} section of the county. At <b>Saline,</b> the highway enters the suburban edge of the Ann Arbor–Ypsilanti metro area. US12 follows Michigan Avenue northeasterly through <b>Saline</b> and across an interchange with US23 before intersecting I-94 in Pittsfield and Ypsilanti townships. US12 leaves Michigan Avenue to follow I-94 at that freeway's exit181; Michigan Avenue continues into downtown Ypsilanti as a city street. I-94/US12 skirts around {{the south side of}} the city and intersects the western end of Business US12 (Bus. US12) at Huron Street south of downtown. The freeway continues around {{the south side of the}} city and rounds the north end of Ford Lake. It is bounded by residential neighborhoods, and it crosses the Huron River on the eastern side of Ypsilanti. Near the Willow Run industrial complex and airport, US12 separates from I-94 and turns northeasterly along an expressway on the north side of the airport. There are three interchanges, including one for the eastern end of M-17 before US12 crosses into Wayne County and intersects the eastern end of Bus. US12.|$|E

Guidelines differ as to which dose to use when blood sugar levels start falling; some recommend reducing the dose of insulin once glucose falls below 16.6mmol/l (300mg/dl) but other recommend infusing glucose in addition to <b>saline</b> to allow for ongoing infusion of higher doses of insulin.|$|E

5|$|The {{amount of}} fluid {{replaced}} {{depends on the}} estimated degree of dehydration. If dehydration is so severe as to cause shock (severely decreased blood pressure with insufficient blood supply to the body's organs), or a depressed level of consciousness, rapid infusion of <b>saline</b> (1 liter for adults, 10 ml/kg in repeated doses for children) is recommended to restore circulating volume. Slower rehydration based on calculated water and sodium shortage may be possible if the dehydration is moderate, and again <b>saline</b> is the recommended fluid. Very mild ketoacidosis with no associated vomiting and mild dehydration may be treated with oral rehydration and subcutaneous rather than intravenous insulin under observation for signs of deterioration.|$|E

5|$|The geology of the Riverina {{comprises}} several troughs and sedimentary basins. The western Riverina {{is presumed}} to be {{a continuation of the}} Ballarat and Bendigo geological zone while eastern sections are underlain by western portions of the Lachlan Fold Belt. There is potential for the Riverina to host several mineral deposit types including coal, petroleum, coal seam methane, gypsum, orogenic gold, Cobar style polymetallic systems, heavy mineral sands and possibly diamonds in these fold belt rocks and basins. Riverina soils are generally sandy along the river channels, with more <b>saline</b> grey and brown clays found on rarely flooded areas on the perimeter of the floodplain. As the Murrumbidgee passes downstream, the water and soil become more <b>saline.</b>|$|E
