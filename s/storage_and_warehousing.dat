5|$|Plans for {{the club}} {{to move to a}} new groundMaine Roadin Moss Side were {{announced}} in 1922. The final Manchester City match at Hyde Road was a league fixture against Newcastle United on 28 April 1923, and in August 1923 a public practice game was the last football match played at Hyde Road. Manchester City began the 192324 season at Maine Road, which had an 80,000 capacity. Parts of Hyde Road were used elsewhere; the roof of the Main Stand was sold to Halifax Town, and erected at The Shay, where even in the 21st century, part of the Hyde Road roof is still in place. Within a decade, all traces of the football ground had disappeared from Hyde Road. The bulk of the area was taken over by Manchester Corporation Tramways department, whose major Hyde Road depot and works was alongside, for use as their Permanent Way yard for assembling and storing tramway rails and materials. The Tramways system also provided at this time a substantial parcels handling service within the city, using both vans and special parcels trams, and a new central parcels depot was built on the Bennett Street side of the former site, against the railway viaduct. After the end of Manchester's trams in 1949 (most of the old trams were scrapped on this site) it was used for storing old buses and as a bus drivers' training area. As of 2000, the site of the pitch is Olympic Freight Terminal, a container <b>storage</b> <b>and</b> <b>warehousing</b> facility.|$|E

50|$|The {{industry}} {{peaked in}} 1912 when it produced 8 billion yards of cloth. The Great War of 1914-18 halted {{the supply of}} raw cotton, and the British government encouraged its colonies to build mills to spin and weave cotton. The war over, Lancashire never regained its markets. The independent mills were struggling. The Bank of England set up the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in 1929 to attempt to rationalise and save the industry. Welkin Mill, Lower Bredbury was one of 104 mills bought by the LCC, {{and one of the}} 53 mills that survived through to 1950. Ring mill producing 40's to 50's.

5000|$|Wholesaling {{facilitates}} the economic function of {{buying and selling}} (usually termed as [...] "price formation") by allowing the forces {{of supply and demand}} to converge to establish a single price for a commodity. The wholesaler may also perform <b>storage</b> <b>and</b> <b>warehousing</b> functions, as well as allowing economies of scale to be obtained in the transportation of produce from farm to market. The people involved in wholesaling can act simply as merchants, buying and selling produce, can be brokers dealing in orders rather than goods, or can be commission agents. Prices are normally established by negotiation but some wholesale markets use the auction system. The auction is compulsory in all wholesale markets in big cities in Japan. A comparison of the Japanese system with that in Brisbane, Australia, found that prices moved more frequently and with a greater degree of volatility in Japan than those at Brisbane.|$|E

50|$|Considering {{the extent}} of the {{production}} area, scholars think that there must also be ditches for the depuration of clay, with pipes for the water inflow and down flow, and of some workshops with various lines of production, <b>storage</b> <b>and</b> <b>warehouse.</b> Maybe there were about 15 furnaces, but discovering these will need further excavation campaigns. Working each furnace gave work to 8 people, with 2 or even 3 for each group, so it is possible that in this area there was a village (whose traces are not yet identified) with about 90 families engaged in the production centre.|$|R
