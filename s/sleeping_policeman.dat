Whenever a non-qualifying vehicle is raced, the time is compared to the official Power Laps but then removed from the board, for example - the Ferrari FXX owned by Michael Schumacher (1:10.7) was taken off the board after because it both failed to meet road legal standards and used slick tyres.|$|E

50|$|A {{speed bump}} {{is also known}} as a <b>sleeping</b> <b>{{policeman}}</b> in British English, Maltese English and Caribbean English, a judder bar in New Zealand English, and a lying-down policeman in Croatia, Slovenia and Russia. A speed bump is a bump in a roadway with heights typically ranging between 3 and 4 in. The traverse distance of a speed bump is typically less than or near to 1 ft; contrasting with the wider speed humps, which typically have a traverse distance of 10 to 14 ft.|$|E

5000|$|Amir Qayyum {{was born}} in 1981 in Pakistan. As a child, Qayyum was {{abandoned}} by his father and {{went to live with}} his uncle, a Dr. Shahid. Qayyum displayed violent tendencies at a young age and was thrown out of school. He would also be thrown out of his house by his brothers and sisters after he would beat them up. On September 25, 2003, Shahid and a friend were murdered by unidentified assailants. On February 28, 2004 a suspect named Hafiz Abid was arrested but shot and killed himself in a police van after taking a gun from a <b>sleeping</b> <b>policeman.</b> [...] His uncle's murder caused Qayyum to want to take revenge against society. From June to July 2005, Amir Qayyum killed 14 homeless men with bricks or stones and was known as [...] "The brick killer". He was caught after assaulting a man with a stone. He was sentenced to death on May 10, 2006.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{measurements}} of noise generated by road traffic. In theoretical part is described physical essence of sound, sound spread, perception of sound by human, effects of noise on human, methods of noise reduction, sources of noise from road traffic, legislation regarding noise and traffic-engineering measures. In practical part {{the noise was}} measured. Evaluate the noise at the bus stop, different noise level on straight road and <b>sleeping</b> <b>policeman</b> and different noise level on roads with different maximum speed allowed...|$|E

Their names are PC Snooze, PC Snore and PC Nodoff. They work with Daisy very well. PC Snooze has pale green skin, PC Snore has pale orange skin and PC Nodoff has pale purple skin. In Series 2, the word ZZZ appears from the policemen when they sleep and snore. They are voiced by Russ Abbott.|$|R

40|$|A {{model of}} {{transient}} single-lane traffic flows is proposed, {{taking into account}} the basic components used to control road traffic (traffic lights and 9 ̆ 3 <b>sleeping</b> <b>policemen</b> 9 ̆ 4), which is radically different from those traditionally considered in continuum mechanics. The model takes into account the main property of traffic flows, namely, the property of selforganisation, and enables the conditions required to ensure maximum carring capacity to be describned correctly both qualitatively and quantitatively, as well as the occurrence and evolution of 9 ̆ 3 travelling traffic jams 9 ̆ 4 on road, as well as the effect of road traffic control units. Unlike the first mathematical models, which describe traffic flows 1 - 6, and the corresponding research, generalized in the monograph 7, a model of fraffic flows was proposed in which contains not only a continuity equation but also a differential equation of the motion, and takes into account the limits on speed acceleration of the traffic flow, the technical charactristics of the vehicles and the response of a driver to a change in the road conditions. According to this model, the problem of traffic flow has no direct hydrodynamic analogy. Below, developing this model, we take into account additional road conditions, namely, the different forward visibility distances for a driver, and the presence on the road of traffic lights and 9 ̆ 3 <b>sleeping</b> <b>policemen</b> 9 ̆ 4...|$|R
