5|$|A mid-20th-century report {{estimated}} {{the volume of}} surface <b>seepage</b> into mine workings at Hull Creek was 9.53 gallons per minute per inch of rainfall. The rate of streambed <b>seepage</b> in the area {{was estimated to be}} 17.02 gallons per minute per inch of rainfall. The rate of <b>seepage</b> is much higher than a number of other streams in the area.|$|E
5|$|At the Canning Dam {{and indeed}} all dams, care {{had to be}} taken to prevent water <b>seepage</b> between the {{foundation}} rock and the structure of the dam. At the Canning in addition to cutting back the foundation to solid unfractured rock, a cut-off trench was sited near the upstream face of the dam, down stream which a rock filled drain containing open jointed pipes was provided to intercept any <b>seepage</b> between the rock face and the concrete of the dam. The inclusion of an internal drainage system was considered innovative at the period. Near vertical tubular 8 in (200mm) cut-off drains were provided at five-foot (1.52 m) intervals along the dam to relieve internal <b>seepage</b> through the concrete.|$|E
5|$|An {{embankment}} dam {{is a massive}} artificial water barrier. It is typically created by the emplacement and compaction of a complex semi-plastic mound of various compositions of soil, sand, clay and/or rock. It has a semi-permanent natural waterproof covering for its surface, and a dense, waterproof core. This makes such a dam impervious to surface or <b>seepage</b> erosion.|$|E

50|$|Geologically and touristically {{interesting}} {{are also}} the <b>seepages</b> of the Danube ("Donauversickerungen") in Immendingen and {{to the south of}} Fridingen.|$|R
50|$|Its natural {{habitats}} are forested floodplains, ditches, streamsides, and <b>seepages.</b> With wet weather, the species may enter wooded terrestrial habitats.|$|R
5|$|Continued ingress {{of water}} from the roof and from unroofed {{exterior}} walkways above the ceiling level had caused <b>seepage</b> which carried down salts from the building mortar and deposited them on the ceiling through evaporation. In places this caused the surface of the frescoes to bubble and lift. Although discolouration was a serious problem, bubbling was not, because the thinness and transparency of the paint which Michelangelo employed on the greater part of the ceiling permitted the salts to pass through rather than accumulating beneath the surface.|$|E
5|$|Grassland on the Helvellyn range {{has been}} heavily overgrazed for many years, yet it {{supports}} {{a diversity of}} acid grassland species including sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina) on the summit ridge, matgrass (Nardus stricta) on the middle slopes, and fescue-bent swards on the lower slopes. The Nardus grasslands are the haunt of the scarce mountain ringlet butterfly (Erebia epiphron), the only alpine species of butterfly found in Britain. Acidic flushes (areas of water <b>seepage)</b> with their carpets of sphagnum mosses are common. Less common are basic flushes, which support a greater diversity of species.|$|E
5|$|Northeast Minnesota has 2700-million-year-ago exposed rocks formed during {{volcanic}} activity {{that was in}} the form of <b>seepage</b> of lava from rifts in the sea floor. These lava flows began to rise up out of the ancient ocean to form the Superior craton; the Superior craton later assembled into the Canadian shield, which became part of the North American craton. The Superior province is the largest preserved fragment of Archean crust, and the Canadian shield is the nucleus of the North American craton.|$|E
30|$|The {{variations}} in the size-fractionated chemical concentration of U for the A-SP- 198 and the A-SP- 199 groundwaters are listed in Table  3. The concentrations of U in the fracture <b>seepages</b> were approximately constant for the various filter pore sizes. The U concentrations in the fracture <b>seepages</b> were comparable {{to that in the}} boreholes after 5, 10, and 20 volumes of sampling interval space of groundwater had been replaced (Figures  6 and 7).|$|R

5|$|Out of the 35 or more acid mine {{drainage}} {{sources in}} the Mahanoy Creek watershed, the four most significant ones are the Locust Gap Tunnel, the Packer #5 Breach, the Packer #5 Borehole, and the Girard Mine <b>seepage.</b> The 15 most significant sources have discharges of between 29,200 liters per minute and 680 liters per minute. The pHs of the sources range from 3.9 to 6.7. The iron concentrations at these sites ranges from 2.1 to 18 milligrams per liter. The concentrations of manganese ranges from 0.95 to 6.4 milligrams per liter.|$|E
5|$|After a {{bill that}} would have {{provided}} funds to protect the site failed, then-President Lyndon B. Johnson signed an Executive Order that authorized funding for the Army Corps of Engineers to build a levee around the site to protect it from the imminent flooding caused by construction of the Lower Monumental Dam. Late that year, Daugherty left the dig, leaving Fryxell to lead the project. Once the Lower Monumental Dam was closed in February 1969, within three days, the site was completely underwater, due to the <b>seepage</b> of thick layers of gravel that had not been accounted for. However, as the site was being flooded, the excavation team laid down plastic sheeting topped with gravel in the hopes of being able to return to the dig in the future.|$|E
5|$|Another unusual feature {{found in}} the abyssal and hadal zones is the cold seep, {{sometimes}} called a cold vent. This {{is an area of}} the seabed where <b>seepage</b> of hydrogen sulfide, methane and other hydrocarbon-rich fluid occurs, often {{in the form of a}} deep-sea brine pool. The first cold seeps were discovered in 1983, at a depth of 3200meters in the Gulf of Mexico. Since then, cold seeps have been discovered in many other areas of the World Ocean, including the Monterey Submarine Canyon just off Monterey Bay, California, the Sea of Japan, off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, off the Atlantic coast of Africa, off the coast of Alaska, and under an ice shelf in Antarctica.|$|E
50|$|Nannophya occidentalis is {{a species}} of {{dragonfly}} of the family Libellulidae, known as the western pygmyfly. It inhabits boggy <b>seepages</b> and swamps in south-western Australia.|$|R

5000|$|The Sunset Frog is {{only found}} in {{isolated}} permanently moist peat swamps, in high rainfall areas. These sites have high moisture content {{and are often}} protected from drier conditions by <b>seepages</b> that provide water even through the drier seasons (Spring and Summer). Males call between October and December from shallow pools, water <b>seepages</b> or in open water along creek margins. They make a rapidly repeated [...] "dd-duk-duk". Females lay less than 200 eggs that are deposited singly often supported by algae mats {{just below the surface}} of the water.|$|R
5|$|Capable {{of growing}} at a {{multitude}} of angles {{on a variety of}} surfaces, Physcia caesia also tolerates a wide range of environmental extremes from the high temperatures of desert locations to the low temperatures of the Antarctic. It grows on both dry stone and that moistened by <b>seepage,</b> and can survive being irregularly submerged for extended periods underwater. Like many lichens that grow on rock, Physcia caesia is able to extract nutrients from the substrate upon which it grows, as well as from rainwater and atmospheric dust. It is threatened by habitat loss through development, as well as trampling or overgrowth of its location. A number of lichenicolous species are known parasites.|$|E
5|$|Skyline Drive was {{originally}} lined with miles of chestnut log guardrails. However, the guardrails rotted and were removed in the 1950s and not replaced. The Marys Rock Tunnel was partially lined with concrete in 1958 to prevent icicles {{in the winter}} and water <b>seepage</b> in the summer. In 1983, the Federal Highway Administration began work to replace several of the original stone walls on the drive with concrete walls that used the original stone as a veneer. The road was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 28, 1997. On September 22, 2005, Skyline Drive was designated a National Scenic Byway. Skyline Drive was designated a National Historic Landmark in October 2008 for its pioneering place in the development of national parks in the eastern United States.|$|E
5|$|The tunnel {{proved to}} be a {{constant}} nuisance to the Chicago Great Western and its predecessors. Almost immediately, railroad engineers realized that the unstable nature of shale through which the tunnel was bored, ground water <b>seepage,</b> and the isolated location of the tunnel meant repairs would be frequent and costly. The tunnel was originally braced by wooden beams when it opened to rail traffic in January 1888, but these eventually proved inadequate, and were replaced in 1902 by brick and reinforced concrete. Constant deterioration of the supports meant that large-scale reconstruction of the tunnel was needed in 1912, 1918, 1944 and 1947.|$|E

40|$|Oil and gas {{reservoir}} has long-term suffering from hydrocarbon <b>seepages</b> including macroseepages and microseepages. The presence of <b>seepages</b> documents the first {{element of a}} hydrocarbon system and could therefore reduce exploration risks. Hydrocarbons that escape from underground reservoirs cause oxidation-reduction reactions either in situ or along vertical migration pathways and result in anomalies in the surface sediments and soils. The surface changes can be detected by multispectral remote sensing. The spectroscopy and ASTER multispectral remote sensing were employed to investigate hydrocarbon seepage-induced anomalies in the Kuqa depression basin, southern Tian Shan Mountain, west China, combined with field investigations, geochemical and mineral analyses of selected samples. Results showed that ASTER band ratios of 2 / 1 and 4 / 9 can reveal successfully mineralogical alterations induced by hydrocarbon <b>seepages</b> such as bleached red bed and secondary carbonates in the southern Tian Shan Mountain, which represent an open-window to petroleum system and provide indirect evidence {{for the presence of}} hydrocarbon system at depth. 1...|$|R
50|$|Natural {{habitat of}} Limnonectes tweediei are muddy pools in rainforests near small streams and <b>seepages.</b> It makes holes for breeding. It is {{becoming}} rare due to pollution and habitat degradation.|$|R
5|$|Cordyline australis is a light-demanding pioneer species, and {{seedlings}} die when overtopped {{by other}} trees. To grow well, young plants require open space {{so they are}} not shaded out by other vegetation. Another requirement is water during the seedling stage. Although adult trees can store water and are drought resistant, seedlings need a good supply of water to survive. This stops the species from growing in sand dunes unless there are wet depressions present, and from hillsides {{unless there is a}} <b>seepage</b> area. The fertility of the soil is another factor—settlers in Canterbury used the presence of the species to situate their homesteads and gardens. The fallen leaves of the tree also help to raise the fertility of the soil when they break down. Another factor is temperature, especially the degree of frost. Young trees are killed by frost, and even old trees can be cut back. This is why C.australis is absent from upland areas and from very frosty inland areas.|$|E
5|$|DOE {{has stated}} that seismic and tectonic effects on the natural systems at Yucca Mountain will not {{significantly}} affect repository performance. Yucca Mountain lies in a region of ongoing tectonic deformation, but the deformation rates are too slow to significantly affect the mountain during the 10,000-year regulatory compliance period. Rises in the water table caused by seismic activity would be, at most, a few tens of meters and would not reach the repository. The fractured and faulted volcanic tuff that Yucca Mountain comprises reflects the occurrence of many earthquake-faulting and strong ground motion events during the last several million years, and the hydrological characteristics of the rock would not be changed significantly by seismic events that may occur in the next 10,000 years. The engineered barrier system components will reportedly provide substantial protection of the waste from <b>seepage</b> water, even under severe seismic loading.|$|E
5|$|Studies of {{the water}} quality of the lake in 1983–84 {{indicate}} a decline in quality since the 1965–66 analysis. Scientific research over the years also reveal that Telbal, Botkal, and sewage drains are responsible for a substantial influx of nitrogen and phosphorus into the lake. Quantitatively, fifteen drains and several other sources have released a total of 156.62 tonnes (56.36 tonnes by drains alone) of phosphorus, and 241.18 tonnes of inorganic nitrogen into the lake from a discharge of 11.701 million cubic metres /year. Non-point sources, such as <b>seepage</b> and diffused runoff, also add to this pollution and have been recorded as further adding 4.5 tonnes of total phosphates and 18.14 tonnes of nitrogen (NO3–N and NH4–N) to the lake. Based on the values mentioned above, it has been inferred that the water quality of the lake has deteriorated.|$|E

5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions {{were scheduled to}} be held before the Sunday race: two on Thursday and one on Friday. The first session was due to run for 105 minutes, and {{the second and third}} sessions were scheduled to last 90 minutes. Heavy rain on the days before the event resulted in the local clay absorbing a large amount of water. Only a small amount of evaporation had occurred due to low air temperatures. Race officials examined water that emerged through the track's surface in several areas on Thursday. The track surface had been drilled through overnight in an effort to drain collected water and prevent further <b>seepage.</b> CART's jet dryer was used on the track but, despite creating a dry track surface, water continued to appear through it. CART chief steward Chris Kneifel drove the pace car onto the track at 3:00p.m. British Summer Time (UTC+1) along with all 26 racing vehicles and 23 secondary cars under caution for five installation laps with both groups. No improvement was reported, and CART announced an hour later that the remainder of the day's activities were cancelled.|$|E
5|$|Around the 1880s, San Francisco wine dealers were {{purchasing}} {{wine from}} Napa Valley vintners at low prices (sometimes around 15 to 18 cents per gallon). The dealers had facilities to store and age wines that most Napa Valley vintners lacked, and thus {{were able to}} purchase wine from the vintners at low prices. Because of this, Bourn began a campaign to build the cooperative winery; {{he was in his}} early 30s at the time. He created a business partnership with another businessman, E. Everett Wise, who was of a similar age. Bourn then asked for support within the Napa County wine industry. Bourn met with Henry Pellet, president of the St. Helena Vinicultural Club, who endorsed the idea and encouraged his associates to do the same. Bourn and Wise ended up gathering enough support from the local wine industry, and they hired George Percy and Frederick F. Hamilton of the San Francisco architectural firm Percy & Hamilton to design the Greystone Cellars, along with Italian stonemasons to build the façades, and the Ernest L. Ransome firm to handle concrete work. The plans involved the use of new materials and technology of the time, including the relatively new Portland cement. The cement was used as mortar and also poured over the iron reinforcing rods built within the first and second floor elevations. The heavy timber construction of the third floor provided structural support for not only that floor's cask, barrel and bottle aging space but also for the gravity-flow crushing area located on the floor above. The architects planned for the cellars to hold two million gallons of wine at a time, with thirteen tunnels in the hillside behind the building to hold another million gallons. Those tunnels collapsed due to effects of water <b>seepage</b> and of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.|$|E
