5|$|According to Oan Ali Mohammed, <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> the Arab {{sovereignty}} {{movement was}} the spark {{that led to}} his desire to attack the Iranian Embassy in London.

5|$|Breastfeeding causes {{negative}} feedback to occur on pulse secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Depending {{on the strength}} of the {{negative feedback}}, breastfeeding women may experience complete <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> follicular development, but no ovulation, or normal menstrual cycle may resume. <b>Suppression</b> <b>of</b> ovulation is more likely when suckling occurs more frequently. The production of prolactin in response to suckling is important to maintaining lactational amenorrhea. On average, women who are fully breastfeeding whose infants suckle frequently experience a return of menstruation at fourteen and a half months postpartum. There is a wide range of response among individual breastfeeding women, however, with some experiencing return of menstruation at two months and others remaining amenorrheic for up to 42 months postpartum.|$|E
5|$|Historian Steven Boyd {{argued that}} the <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> the Whiskey Rebellion {{prompted}} anti-Federalist westerners to finally accept the Constitution and to seek change by voting for Republicans rather than resisting the government. Federalists, for their part, came to accept the public's role in governance and no longer challenged the freedom of assembly {{and the right to}} petition.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, as {{a direct}} result of this campaign, Belgium {{formally}} annexed the territory, creating the Belgian Congo.

5|$|It {{was clear}} that Edward now {{regarded}} the struggle not as a war between two nations, but as the <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> a rebellion of disloyal subjects.

40|$|Habituation {{kinetics}} {{were found}} to vary considerably in different polysynaptic pathways of the brain stem in man. The exteroceptive reflex of the digastric muscle habituates markedly, even for stimuli repeated at 1 -min intervals. The second component of the blink reflex habituates for intervals below about 8 sec, but this can largely be prevented by steady voluntary contraction of the muscle. On the other hand the exteroceptive <b>suppressions</b> <b>of</b> the masseter muscle only disclose slight habituation of their late component ES 2 and no habituation of the early component ES 1. This {{does not appear to}} be affected by voluntary activation since the suppressive effects present the same pattern in relaxed masseter muscles tested by proprioceptive reflex activation. Exteroceptive reflexes and exteroceptive <b>suppressions</b> <b>of</b> similar latencies disclose genuine and important differences in their habituation kinetics. © 1976.

5|$|The book {{argues that}} artists have been scapegoated by those advocating censorship, {{as a method}} of {{deflecting}} debate away from the <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> human rights.

Heins argues that even if the perceived negative impacts of pornography,hip hop music, and violent films were factually accurate (and she asserts they are not), the ends would not justify the means of degrading the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. She emphasizes that education should be used to help guard against potentially dangerous notions, instead of censorship and <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> dissent.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} factors are {{involved}} in <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> inflammation by erythromycin and other macrolides. They are especially effective at inhibiting the proliferation of neutrophils, by diminishing the ability of interleukin 8 and leukotriene B4 to attract them. Macrolides also reduce the efficiency of adhesion molecules that allow neutrophils to stick to bronchiolar tissue linings. Mucus production in the airways is a major culprit in the morbidity and mortality of DPB and other respiratory diseases. The significant reduction of inflammation in DPB attributed to erythromycin therapy also helps to inhibit the production of excess mucus.|$|E

Bussard and Falke were broken up for scrap in 1912, but the remaining four ships were still in service following the outbreak of World War I in August 1914.|$|E
