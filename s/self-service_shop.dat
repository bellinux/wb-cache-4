In 1951, ex-US Navy sailor Patrick Galvani, {{son-in-law}} of Express Dairies chairman, made a pitch to the board to open a chain of supermarkets across the country. The UK's first supermarket under the new Premier Supermarkets brand opened in Streatham, South London, taking ten times as much per week as the average British general store of the time. Other chains caught on, and after Galvani lost out to Tesco's Jack Cohen in 1960 to buy the 212 Irwin's chain, the sector underwent {{a large amount of}} consolidation, resulting in 'the big four' dominant UK of today: Tesco, Asda (owned by Wal-Mart), Sainsbury's and Morrisons.|$|R

Ved at fokusere på en af de rejser om selvbetjening, der blev arrangeret i Marshall-regi, kan det vises, hvordan oprettelsen af selvbetjeningsbutikker både var i overensstemmelse med amerikanske og danske ønsker. I den danske detailhandel var især kooperationen interesseret i de nye principper, men der fandtes også skeptiske stemmer, der advarede mod de amerikanske ideer. Abstract The article explores how the {{dissemination}} of <b>self-service</b> <b>shops</b> in Denmark {{was an integral part}} of the Marshall Plan. Focusing on one of those journeys under the auspices of the Marshall Plan to study such <b>self-service</b> <b>shops</b> in the USA, the article shows how the creation of <b>self-service</b> <b>shops</b> was in accordance with American as well as Danish aspirations. In the Danish retailing business, particularly the cooperative movement was interested in the new principles, even if sceptical voices cautioned against these American ideas. Outside these circles, the Danish unions and employers’ organizations supported the intentions to modernize what they considered an expensive link in the retail trade. The gain in productivity pursued by the industry was considered to depend not only on increasing consumption, but also on standardized goods and mass consumption...|$|R

5000|$|In 1918, Rudolf Wanzl Senior {{founded a}} locksmith's in Giebau in the Sudetenland (today {{part of the}} Czech Republic), which he built up into a scale {{manufacturing}} business and agricultural machinery company with 20 employees. After the expulsion of Germans from the region in 1947, Rudolf Wanzl Junior re-established the company in Leipheim as a scale manufacturer and repair workshop. The inspiration {{to focus on the}} concept of self-service came from the cash register manufacturer NCR in Augsburg. The company ordered hand-made shopping baskets for its demonstration room. At around the same time, the [...] "Production" [...] consumer co-operative, based in Hamburg, ordered 40 trolleys and 100 hand baskets for the opening of Germany's first <b>self-service</b> <b>shop.</b> At the start of the 1950s, Rudolf Wanzl travelled to the United States where he met Sylvan Goldman, inventor of the shopping trolley. On the return flight he had already designed his own more manoeuvrable version, which became the model for all shopping trolleys in use today. In 1951, the first shopping trolley with a fixed basket was patented. Three years later, the co-owning Siegel brothers left the company to found their own business. This is how it came about that Germany's two largest shopping trolley manufacturers were both based in Leipheim for many years. By 1956, Wanzl had 74 employees.|$|E
50|$|Many, {{fiercely}} local, societies saw the CWS as {{a valuable}} supplier but {{did not want to}} exclusively purchase produce from a single source. In order to increase loyalty to the CWS, they started to assist the local retail societies in more ways than simply as a wholesaler. The CWS Bank, the precursor to The Co-operative Bank, financed loans for societies to use for expansion through purchasing new buildings, land or new equipment. After the acquisition of the Co-operative Insurance Society in 1913, the CWS also provided insurance services to members and the CWS also began providing legal services - all business which remain today. It was hoped that these financial tie, as well as the CWS corporate dividend, would increase loyalty to the CWS. During World War II rationing led to an effective pause in any major changes to the co-operative movement in the UK with the CWS becoming highly involved in sourcing overseas goods for UK consumers and manufacturing wartime goods. Following the war there was some attempt to modernise the co-operative stores. After the London Co-operative Society opened its first <b>self-service</b> <b>shop</b> in 1942 the co-operative movement led the way on the development of self-service stores to the point where, by the 1950s, 90% of self-service shops in the UK were run by co-operatives. Despite this the market share and the number of members of the society began to dwindle and - importantly - so did the member share capital which societies used to invest. The CWS responded with operation facelift in 1968 which introduced the first national co-operative branding, the 'Co-op' cloverleaf. Though operation facelift led to some improvements the movement (including the CWS) remained largely unreformed with its grocery market share continuing its downward trend. It was also suggested around this time that societies merge to form regional societies to improve their competitiveness through the economies of scale. Many local co-op societies strongly resisted such mergers but, as their financial situation declined, many were forced to merge to create regional societies or with either the CRS or the SCWS to avoid failing. Consolidation within the movement was considerable and in 1973 serious financial mismanagement of the SCWS Bank led to the SCWS and the CWS merging to form a single UK-wide wholesale society.|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis {{is concerned with the}} design and evaluation of a checkout system in <b>self-service</b> <b>shops</b> in Sweden. The aims were (a) to study the ergonomics of {{the development of a new}} check-out system which is to be part of a new automatic data handling system in retailing, and (b) to evaluate certain ergonomics methods used in a system development programme. The thesis falls into five parts. The first deals with a system analysis of check-out systems in <b>self-service</b> <b>shops.</b> The second consists of a literaturereview of the ergonomics of keyboards relevant to cash register design. The third describes an experimental evaluation of two keyboards suitable for use with cash registers. The fourth describes surveys, involving interviews, cuestionnaires and observational studies, on customers and cashiers using and working in <b>self-service</b> <b>shops.</b> In the fifth and final part experimental and survey results are discussed and interpreted. The principal results obtained can be summarised as follows. (a) For ten button keyboards speed and accuracy of performance is better with the keys 123 on the top row and the keys 789 on the bottom row, than conversely. Cashiers generally prefer the 123 to the 789 keyboard. (b) A new cash desk (into which the 123 keyboard may be placed) incorporating two moving conveyor belts, which has recently been introduced into <b>self-service</b> <b>shops</b> has improved working conditions for cashiers. Suggestions are made on how the cash desk may be further improved from the point of view of both cashiers and customers. (c) Important relationships between results obtained from interviews involving the reporting of critical incidents, questionnaires and observational studies are reported and the methodological implication of these relations reviewed...|$|R

This work is mainly focused on revitalization of the square. It contains small urban interventions like lamps, bus stop, greenery and one major architectural element - community housing for seniors. Until early 1980 ’s, there’re country houses surrounding the square from all sides. Since then, there’s been a <b>self-service</b> <b>shop</b> which disrupts the rural character of the village. Today the shop is closed and the building, where the shop sited, is deteriorating. The condition of this building and disturbed appearance of the square were the main reasons why I decided to bring a new life to the village centre through the community house for seniors. The concept of the community house is based on typical country houses which had formed the village square in the past. The community house is intended for active old generation as well as people who need professional care. Neighborly ties are the mainstay of this community housing...|$|E

40|$|About {{five decades}} the Franc CFA-Zone in Western and Central Africa was praised as {{incarnation}} {{of economic and}} political stability in Africa, backed by France. But free convertibility and fixed parity, guaranteed by the French Treasury, mainly served the interest of a small elite of the Messieurs Afrique, both in France and in Africa. Generations of French entrepreneurs and of their African counterparts maintained a profitable <b>self-service</b> <b>shop</b> on expense of the African poor and the French taxpayer. In the aftermath of the devaluation of the Franc CFA in 1994, and of the peg of the currency to the Euro in 1998, the socio-economic divide between rich and poor, urban and rural regions, the formal and the informal sector even widened. However, the perpetuation of the established monetary structure of the CFA-Zone became increasingly anachronistic. As far as the political stability, previously guaranteed by the neo-colonial French Africa policy, becomes obsolete, the base for economic stability of the traditional arrangement of the currency union is threatened as well. The more so, as the CFA-Zone never fulfilled the most crucial preconditions of an optimal currency area. The peg to the EMU, orientated at the interests of highly industrialized European countries, led to an overvaluation of the real exchange rate of the CFA, and will increasingly constitute an obstacle to sustainable indigenous development in francophone Africa. ...|$|E

In the first stage, facial expressions associated with negative affect were found to occur during <b>self-service</b> <b>shopping</b> interactions, indicating that facial expression detection is suitable for detecting negative affective states during self-service interactions. In the second stage, user perceptions of the emotional facial expressions displayed by an emotional agent during a problematic self-service interaction were gathered. Overall, the expression of disgust was found to be perceived as inappropriate while emotionally neutral behaviour was perceived as appropriate, however gender differences suggested that females perceived surprise as inappropriate.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this casebook, like others in the Ius Commune Series, is to help uncover common roots, notwithstanding differences in approach, of the European legal systems, {{with a view to}} strengthening the common legal heritage of Europe. It covers the big legal families in the EU and contains judgments from the supreme courts and other courts of the Member States. In view of the importance of EC legislation (eg harmonisation directives and regulations) in this field, the consumer law casebook contains much material derived from Community law, such as extracts from directives (eg on unfair contract terms, distance selling, doorstep selling, product liability, unfair commercial pratices etc) and judgments of the ECJ and national court decisions. Furthermore, attention is paid to the way in which, when interpreting EC directives in the consumer field, the ECJ refers to concepts common to the legal systems of the Member States and how the courts of the Member States incorporate the concepts found in the directives (as interpreted by the ECJ) in their legal systems. The casebook also compares harmonised and pre-harmonised law, especially in the case law of the Member States. It concentrates on private law in the field of consumer protection but also addresses topics, in particular in the field of enforcement, that are primarily a matter of public law.

50|$|Meijer {{was founded}} as Meijer's in Greenville, Michigan, by Hendrik Meijer, a Dutch immigrant. Meijer {{was a local}} barber who entered the grocery {{business}} during the Great Depression. His first employees included his 14-year-old son, Frederik Meijer, who later became chairman of the company. The current co-chairmen, brothers Hank and Doug Meijer, are Hendrik's grandsons. After studying trends in the grocery industry, Meijer {{was among the first}} stores to offer <b>self-service</b> <b>shopping</b> and shopping carts. He also offered staple items, such as vinegar, at bargain prices.|$|R
50|$|The Schwegmanns {{introduced}} New Orleans to <b>self-service</b> <b>shopping,</b> then {{a novelty}} that eventually became an ordinary feature of American life and doomed the smaller stores in which proprietors filled each customer's order. For a time, the Schwegmanns still offered full service for traditional shoppers, but they encouraged customers to gather their own {{items from the}} shelves and to take their baskets to the checkout counter. While this innovation was not initially well received, shoppers accepted the idea quickly {{so that they could}} obtain a 10 percent discount if they helped themselves.|$|R
50|$|Under the {{leadership}} of the founder’s grandsons, Albert and Gerrit Jan Heijn, the company continued to make a significant impact on food retail in the Netherlands in the next four decades, pioneering <b>self-service</b> <b>shopping,</b> and the development of own brand and of non-food as a grocery store category. The company also influenced culinary development in the country, popularizing products such as wine, sherry and kiwi fruit, contributing to the introduction of the refrigerator in Dutch households and introducing convenience items, such as ready meals and frozen pizzas, to Dutch consumers.|$|R
50|$|In 1997 Ganz {{unveiled}} a new retail shopping concept called the Body Bar, a <b>self-servicing</b> lingerie <b>shopping</b> assistant which provided product information based on anatomical area, and reduced shoppers' dependency on salespeople.|$|R
50|$|During his 23 {{years as}} Chairman, Sainsbury's {{replaced}} all its 82 counter service stores with modern supermarkets, {{and the number}} of UK grocery stores increased from 244 stores (including 162 <b>self-service</b> <b>shops)</b> to 313 supermarkets, whilst the average size of new supermarkets increased from 8120 sq ft to 34980 sq ft. The range of products increased from 4,000 (including 1,500 own brand products) to 16,000 (including 8,000 own brand products). He was said to personally taste own brand products himself {{to make sure he was}} satisfied with its quality control, and personally approved every own brand product packaging design himself before the official launch of each new own brand product. He was said to turn up unannounced at stores by helicopter to patrol the aisles and highlight deficiencies.|$|R
50|$|In 1990, plant IV {{is opened}} in Leipheim, {{close to the}} A8 motorway. Today, this plant {{is home to the}} company's headquarters. In 1991, Wanzl founds the Shop Solutions {{business}} division. From now on, the fittings for entire supermarkets may be planned and shelving systems manufactured. With the fall of the Iron Curtain, the concept of <b>self-service</b> <b>shopping</b> also spreads to Eastern Europe, opening up new markets. In 1995, a production plant is opened in the Czech Republic, not far from Rudolf Wanzl's former home town. In 1998, after ten years as Managing Director, Gottfried Wanzl assumes overall management of the business from his father. Major orders such as equipping the new airport in Hong Kong with luggage trolleys drive employee numbers and sales figures even higher. In 1999, one million shopping trolleys are manufactured in a year for the first time.|$|R
50|$|Generally, {{criminal}} theft involves {{taking possession}} of property illegally. In <b>self-service</b> <b>shops,</b> customers are {{allowed by the}} property owner to take physical possession of the property by holding or moving it. This leaves areas of ambiguity that could criminalize some people for simple mistakes, such as accidental putting of a small item in a pocket or forgetting to pay. For this reason penalties for shoplifting are often lower than those for general theft. Few jurisdictions have specific shoplifting legislation with which to differentiate it from other forms of theft, so reduced penalties are usually at a judge's discretion. Most retailers {{are aware of the}} serious consequences of making a false arrest, and will only attempt to apprehend a person if their guilt is beyond a reasonable doubt. Depending on local laws, arrests made by anyone other than law enforcement officers may also be illegal.|$|R
40|$|All {{hypermarket}} retailers offer similar {{products and}} services. One {{of the ways}} to make a particular hypermarket unique is by offering the hypermarket corporate brand extension through products on the shelves and by an extended <b>self-service</b> <b>shopping</b> concept that only facilities the consumers’ purchase and consumption from a particular hypermarket outlet. The purpose of this research is to analyse the relationship of corporate brand extension for the product and service with brand value in hypermarket retailing, and to examine the influence of consumer experience and brand personality as mediating effects in the relationship. This research is a cross-sectional study. The primary data for this research were collected through survey questionnaires from 785 hypermarket consumers based on convenience sampling. The main analyses comprised descriptive analysis followed by exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and structural equation modeling (SEM). The findings from the analyses indicate {{that the majority of the}} respondents purchase and consume hypermarket corporate brand extension in both the product and service dimensions...|$|R
