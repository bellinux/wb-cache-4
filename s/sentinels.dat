40|$|Introduction: Several {{radiotracers}} {{are being}} used for <b>sentinel</b> node mapping in patients with breast cancer. In the current study, we reported our experience with 99 m-Tc Phytate for <b>sentinel</b> node mapping in Mashhad University of Medical Sciences. Methods: All breast cancer patients who underwent <b>sentinel</b> node mapping using 99 m-Tc Phytate were included. All patients received intradermal peri-areolar injection of 0. 5 mCi/ 0. 1 cc 99 m-Tc Phytate. Lymphoscintiraphy was performed for 145 patients 5 - 10 minutes post-injection. The <b>sentinel</b> nodes were found during surgery using a hand-held gamma probe as well as blue dye technique. Results: In total 165 patients were evaluated. Lymphoscintigraphy showed axillary <b>sentinel</b> nodes in 135 out of 145 patients (93 %) following imaging. At least one <b>sentinel</b> node could be detected in all these 135 patients during surgery. In the remaining 10 patients with <b>sentinel</b> node non-visualization, 5 had <b>sentinel</b> node harvesting failure during surgery. Median number of <b>sentinel</b> nodes on the lymphoscintigraphy images was 1. <b>Sentinel</b> node detection rate was 95 % (157 / 165). In the 8 patients with <b>sentinel</b> node harvesting failure, 7 had pathologically involved axilla. Median number of harvested <b>sentinel</b> nodes was 1. Mean <b>sentinel</b> node to background count ratio was 10 ± 2. Conclusions: 99 m-Tc Phytate is an effective and highly successful radiotracer for <b>sentinel</b> node mapping. <b>Sentinel</b> node can be visualized {{in a short time}} after 99 m-Tc Phytate injection on the lymphoscintigraphy images. The <b>sentinel</b> to background count during surgery is high which results in more convenient <b>sentinel</b> node harvesting and high detection rate...|$|R

5|$|Born in 1888 in Omaha, Nebraska, Stevens became {{involved}} in the fight for suffrage while a college student at Oberlin College. After graduating with a degree in sociology in 1911, she taught briefly before becoming a paid regional organizer for the National American Woman Suffrage Association's Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage (CUWS). When the CUWS broke from the parent organization in 1914, Stevens became the national strategist. She was in charge of coordinating the women's congress, held at the Panama Pacific Exposition in 1915. When the CUWS became the National Woman's Party (NWP) in 1916, Stevens organized party delegates for each of the 435 Congressional Districts in an effort to attain national women's enfranchisement and defeat candidates who were opposed to women's rights. Between 1917 and 1919, Stevens was a prominent participant in the Silent <b>Sentinels</b> vigil at Woodrow Wilson's White House to urge the passage of a constitutional amendment for women's voting rights and was arrested several times for her involvement. After the 19th Amendment secured women's right to vote, she wrote a book, titled Jailed for Freedom (1920), which recounted the sentinel's ordeals.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to assess the {{diagnostic}} value of the <b>sentinel</b> node method in patients suffering from squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract. In 50 patients with oral, pharyngeal or laryngeal carcinomas staged N 0 up to 50 MBq technetium- 99 m colloid were injected peritumorally. <b>Sentinel</b> nodes were localised using a g-probe in the setting of an elective neck dissection. Pathological findings of <b>sentinel</b> nodes and corresponding neck specimens were compared. In 46 patients <b>sentinel</b> nodes were detected. Of these 34 patients were free of metastatic disease in the <b>sentinel</b> nodes and in the neck specimens. In 12 patients clinically occult metastases were found in the <b>sentinel</b> nodes. Three metastases were detected only after additional sectioning of the <b>sentinel</b> nodes. In four patients, a <b>sentinel</b> lymph node could not be localised. Our results support the <b>sentinel</b> node concept in head and neck cancer and a definition of the <b>sentinel</b> nodes as the three nodes with the highest activity. Careful clinical staging of the neck and thorough pathological evaluation of the <b>sentinel</b> nodes are necessary to avoid false-negative results...|$|R
40|$|To report our {{experience}} {{about the role}} of <b>sentinel</b> node biopsy in cervical cancer patients while debating provocatory arguments concerning this procedure. From June 2001 to February 2003, patients affected by stage IB(1) cervical cancer were submitted to the <b>sentinel</b> node biopsy procedure. Patients were submitted to lymphoscintigraphy and, subsequently, to laparoscopy in order to locate the <b>sentinel</b> lymph node. Thirty-seven patients were enrolled in the study. <b>Sentinel</b> node(s) was(were) identified with preoperative lymphoscintigraphy in 89 % of the patients. Intraoperative detection rate was 70 %. During surgery in 31 % of the patients, <b>sentinel</b> node was detected bilaterally; in 15 %, two <b>sentinel</b> nodes {{on the same side of}} the lymphatic vessels were detected. The <b>sentinel</b> node was located at the level of superficial common iliac vessels (26 %), external iliac vessels (69 %), and superficial obturator vessels (49 %). In 77 % of the patients, the histologic specimen sent by the surgeon as unique <b>sentinel</b> node contained two or more nodes. Metastatic <b>sentinel</b> nodes were found in 23 % of the patients. There was no case with a positive nonsentinel node in the presence of a negative <b>sentinel</b> node. <b>Sentinel</b> node detection is a feasible procedure in cervical cancer patients. However, a high percentage of patients is found with bilateral and/or more than one <b>sentinel</b> lymph node. Improvements in detection rate and pathological analysis are needed prior to consider the <b>sentinel</b> node biopsy a routine procedure in cervical cancer patients...|$|R

5|$|Faced {{with this}} information, Master Chief and Cortana decide to destroy Halo to prevent its activation. While {{fighting}} the Flood, the Covenant, and Guilty Spark's <b>Sentinels,</b> Cortana discovers {{that the best}} way to accomplish this is to cause the crashed Pillar of Autumn to self-destruct. However, Captain Keyes' authorization is required to destroy the Autumn, forcing the Chief and Cortana to return to the now-Flood-infested Truth and Reconciliation to search for him. By the time they reach Keyes, however, he has been infected beyond the point of no return by the Flood. Master Chief retrieves Keyes' neural implants directly from his brain and retreats to the Autumn, where Cortana activates the ship's self-destruct sequence. However, 343 Guilty Spark reappears and deactivates the countdown, discovering the record of human history in the process. Master Chief manually destabilizes the Pillar of Autumns fusion reactors, and he and Cortana narrowly escape the destruction of the ring via a fighter. Cortana scans nearby space and finds that they are apparently the only survivors. Cortana justifies the sacrifices of the other humans on Halo, stating that they had no choice due to the threat posed by Halo, the Covenant and the Flood.

5|$|Japan's {{entry into}} the war in late 1941 stopped plans for the {{deployment}} of Australian armour to the Middle East. By the beginning of 1943 the Australian Armoured Corps was at its peak with 1,460 tanks on strength, {{the majority of them}} Matildas and light and medium M3s. Meanwhile, 65 production AC1 vehicles and one AC3 had been completed by June 1943. That year, the 3rd Army Tank Battalion was equipped with a squadron of AC1 tanks, which were modified to resemble German tanks and used in the filming of the movie, The Rats of Tobruk. This appears to have been the only time a squadron of <b>Sentinels</b> was used for any purpose. Nevertheless, the completed Sentinel tanks were used for evaluation purposes only and were not issued to operational armoured units, as the Australian Cruiser tank program was terminated in July 1943. By this time the Japanese threat had lessened, and US and British-made M3 Grant and Matilda tanks were being supplied to Australia from the Middle East, and it was felt that Australia's manufacturing resources would be better spent on railway locomotive production.|$|E

40|$|Introduction:. <b>Sentinel</b> {{lymph node}} biopsy is {{indicated}} for patients with biopsy-proven thickness melanoma greater than 1. 0 [*]mm. Use of lymphoscintigraphy along with vital blue dyes is {{the gold standard for}} identifying <b>sentinel</b> lymph nodes intraoperatively. Indocyanine green (ICG) has recently been used as a method of identifying <b>sentinel</b> lymph nodes. We herein describe a case series of patients who have successfully undergone ICG-assisted <b>sentinel</b> {{lymph node biopsy}} for melanoma. We compare 2 imaging systems that are used for ICG-assisted <b>sentinel</b> lymph node biopsy. Methods:. Fourteen patients underwent ICG-assisted <b>sentinel</b> lymph node biopsy for melanoma using the SPY Elite system (Novadaq, Mississigua, Canada) and the Hamamatsu PDE-Neo probe system (Mitaka USA, Park City, Utah). We analyzed costs for 2 systems that utilize ICG for <b>sentinel</b> lymph node biopsies. Results:. Intraoperative use of ICG for <b>sentinel</b> lymph node biopsies was successful in correctly identifying <b>sentinel</b> lymph nodes. There was no difference between the Hamamatsu PDE-Neo probe and SPY Elite systems in the ability to detect <b>sentinel</b> lymph nodes; however, the former was associated with a lower operating cost and ease of use compared with the latter. Conclusion:. ICG-assisted <b>sentinel</b> lymph biopsy using the SPY Elite or the Hamamatsu PDE-Neo probe systems for melanoma are comparable in terms of <b>sentinel</b> node detection.

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of the <b>sentinel</b> node technique {{in the evaluation of}} axillary node involvement in breast cancer was evaluated in 83 consecutive patients with monofocal T 1 - 2 carcinoma, who were clinically N 0 and who underwent lymphoscintigraphy with 99 mTc-colloid integrated with intraoperative <b>sentinel</b> node detection by a portable probe. Lymphoscintigraphy revealed at least one <b>sentinel</b> node in 75 patients (90. 4 %), always identified by the probe. In eight patients (9. 6 %) the <b>sentinel</b> node was detected neither by lymphoscintigraphy nor by the probe. All removed lymph nodes were analyzed by hematoxylin-eosin histology and the <b>sentinel</b> node by immunostaining. In 28 / 75 patients (37. 3 %) at least one metastatic axillary lymph node was detected; in 16 of the 28 N+ subjects (57 %) only the <b>sentinel</b> node was positive. The false negative rate (<b>sentinel</b> node negative/other axillary lymph nodes positive) was 17. 85 % (5 / 28 patients). In 9 / 23 patients (39 %) micrometastases were found in the <b>sentinel</b> node only. In conclusion, specific <b>sentinel</b> node positivity in 57 % of cases supports the validity of the <b>sentinel</b> node concept. Moreover, nine patients would have been considered N 0 by standard hematoxylin-eosin histology without <b>sentinel</b> node-aided immunostaining.
