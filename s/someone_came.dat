5|$|Pokiri success {{elevated}} Mahesh to super-stardom {{and brought}} recognition to Jagannadh {{as a writer}} and director. The sequences featuring Brahmanandam as a software engineer, the comedy track of Ali and Brahmanandam, Mahesh asking D'Cruz to give him upma at the railway station were acclaimed. The fashion trend of wearing doctor sleeves increased in Andhra Pradesh after Mahesh sported them and they continue to influence fashion even today. After the film's release, many films were released subsequently that had titles bordering on cuss words including Jagannadh's next film Desamuduru (2006). Mahesh revealed that he became confused after the film's success:It was such a huge hit, that if <b>someone</b> <b>came</b> to me with a script, I would approach the result of the film before approaching the character. I only wanted to act in movies that were like Pokiri, I think that was a mistake. It all got to me and I felt that I needed a break from films itself. Initially, I wanted just a seven-month break. I signed Khaleja after nine months, but it just kept getting delayed and the break ended up becoming a two-year-long holiday. But I didn't freak out... I relaxed {{for the first time in}} life.|$|E
25|$|The Honeymooners {{originated}} from a sketch Gleason was developing with his show's writers. He {{said he had}} an idea he wanted to enlarge: a skit with a smart, quiet wife and her very vocal husband. He went on to describe that, while the couple had their fights, underneath it all they loved each other. Titles for the sketch were tossed around until <b>someone</b> <b>came</b> up with The Honeymooners.|$|E

[...] Chief Scott's wife, Addie Scott, lived {{with him on the}} third floor and later recalled the station's early days: [...] "I remember the horses. [...] They really knew what to do. [...] When the bell would ring, they would come out and stand there to be hitched up. ... It was a nice life here for us. ... I remember trying to wax all these floors, and I just couldn't do it. [...] So <b>someone</b> <b>came</b> and helped me. [...] This is a lot of floor space you know." ...|$|E

500|$|Smalls Paradise {{played a}} role in popularizing the Madison in 1960, but the night club's burst of {{popularity}} in the early 1960s came from the later dance craze, the Twist. [...] Since Tuesday nights were exceptionally slow at Big Wilt's Smalls Paradise, the club looked for a way to bring in more business. [...] <b>Someone</b> <b>came</b> up with the idea to hold Twist dance contests on Tuesday evenings and the club's weekly contest started in December 1961.

500|$|During the {{production}} of X2, producer Lauren Shuler Donner had discussed {{the idea of a}} film focusing on the young X-Men with the crew, which was met with approval; the concept was revived during {{the production}} of [...] One of The Last Stands writers, Zak Penn, was hired to write and direct this spin-off, but this idea later fell through. Penn explained in 2007 that [...] "the original idea was to have me do a young X-Men spin-off, a spin-off of the young X-Men characters. But <b>someone</b> <b>came</b> up with a pretty interesting idea [...] it was this guy who worked with me named Mike Chamoy, he worked a lot with me on X3. He came up with how to do a young X-Men movie which is not what you'd expect." ...|$|E
500|$|Melish engaged Constance Ortmayer {{to design}} the coin. Ortmayer later remembered, [...] "I was {{recommended}} by them, <b>someone</b> <b>came</b> through Cincinnati... they were just looking for somebody so they recommended me". Ortmayer apparently prepared a design before the bill passed Congress, for Melish wrote to Assistant Director of the Mint Mary Margaret O'Reilly on April 4, 1936 that the original [...] "lacked distinction and artistic merit" [...] and that Ortmayer would redesign the coin. He wrote again on May 7, asking if Ortmayer's new design was satisfactory. The models were submitted to the Commission of Fine Arts, charged since 1921 with advising on coin design, though the government was not bound to follow its recommendations. On May 13, the chairman, Charles Moore, wrote to Mint Director Nellie Tayloe Ross, withholding approval.|$|E

500|$|On Wednesday, March 3, 1993, in Rancho Viejo, Texas, an {{affluent}} community {{just north of}} Brownsville, Fischer woke up early {{to get ready for}} school. Just before 7:00a.m., he went to the garage and reversed his mother's car into the circular driveway at his home at 3 Cortez Avenue. He then walked toward {{the corner of the house}} and grabbed a garden hose to spray water on the car's windows, which were covered in dust. As he sprayed the car, <b>someone</b> <b>came</b> from behind and shot him twice at point-blank range with what would later be identified as a [...]38 Super pistol. One of the shots penetrated his chest and the others his brain. Fischer's mother looked out the window to see what had happened, thinking the noise came from one of the house's palm tree branches falling on the roof, or that the car had backfired. She did not see the car, and thought that perhaps her son had gone to a convenience store to pick up something, but Fischer's brother Eric told her he could see the car parked on the driveway.|$|E

He said, [...] "I used to stand outside the theater knowing the truant officer was looking for me. I would stand there 'til <b>someone</b> <b>came</b> along, and then ask them to buy my ticket. It was necessary for an adult to accompany a juvenile into the theater. When I succeeded I'd give him my ten cents—that's all it cost—and I'd go {{up to the top of}} the balcony where I'd put my chin on the rail and watch, spellbound, from the first act to the last. I would usually select the actor I liked the most and follow his performance throughout the play." ...|$|E

2500|$|In early January 2013, Willie Frazer {{said that}} he and a group of loyalists planned to hold a protest outside the Irish {{parliament}} building, Leinster House, in Dublin and [...] "sarcastically" [...] ask for the Irish flag to be taken down. Frazer said [...] "it's a tongue-in-cheek gesture. It's to give Irish people a sense of how we feel. I would be very offended if I was living in Ireland and <b>someone</b> <b>came</b> and asked me to take the flag down. That’s exactly how we feel in Belfast. People keep telling us we're still part of the UK, yet here we are without a flag". In 2006, a march in Dublin, organised by Love Ulster, had sparked riots. The Progressive Unionist Party's Billy Hutchinson condemned the clashes, while his colleague, Phil Hamilton, criticised the PSNI for not deploying enough officers to the Short Strand area on 12 January to prevent violence. The UDA's Jimmy Birch told the BBCs Radio Ulster: [...] "Every time they call a tune, we take to the streets. We are wrecking our own areas, we fight with the police, we are burning our own cars and we stop our own people going to work and disrupt our own people's way of life. It is wrong, we need to step back and we need to stop being predictable." ...|$|E
2500|$|Max Tackett, a 33-year-old Arkansas State Police officer rookie at the time, {{realized}} that a car had been stolen on the nights of the murders, and a previously stolen car was found abandoned. On Friday, June 28, 1946, Tackett found a car that had been reported stolen in a parking lot. He staked out the car until <b>someone</b> <b>came</b> back to it. He arrested a 21-year-old woman. She said she had just married her husband in Shreveport, but he was currently in Atlanta, Texas trying to sell another stolen car. Homer Carter, chief of police in Atlanta, told Tackett that a man had tried selling a stolen car {{to one of his}} citizens. Tackett asked the citizen if he would recognize the suspect, but the man said that he would not. Tackett noticed that the citizen had a distinct look, which included a cowboy hat and boots. Tackett told the citizen, [...] "You wouldn't recognize him, but he would recognize you." [...] Max then asked the citizen if {{he would be willing to}} walk with him into several public places. Tackett had the idea that the suspect would not want to see the citizen and would try to avoid him. On a Saturday in July, Tackett walked into the Arkansas Motor Coach bus station on Front Street, near Union Station, with the citizen. Tackett saw a man run out the back of the building. He chased after him and caught him on the fire escape. The man, Youell Swinney, would not talk, but his wife Peggy confessed in great detail that he was the Phantom Killer and that he killed Betty Jo Booker and Paul Martin.|$|E
