5|$|Nordmann {{was born}} on 22 November 1915 in Giessen, {{at the time in}} the Grand Duchy of Hesse of the German Empire. He {{was the son of a}} doctor and joined the {{military}} service of the Luftwaffe on 6 April 1936 as a Fahnenjunker (officer cadet). Nordmann was promoted to Leutnant (Second Lieutenant) on 1 January 1938 and served with 1. Staffel of Kampfgeschwader 253 from 1 March to 30 April 1938. He was then posted to the Jagdfliegerschule (Fighter Pilot School) at Werneuchen, under the command of Oberst (Colonel) Theodor Osterkamp. Since July 1938, he served as a Staffeloffizier (squadron officer) with the <b>Stab</b> <b>of</b> I. Gruppe (1st group) of Jagdgeschwader 77 (JG 77—77th Fighter Wing), which later became IV./Jagdgeschwader 51 (JG 51—51st Fighter Wing).|$|E
5|$|Following three {{victories}} on 20 August, two I-153 and a I-16, Gollob {{shot down}} two Bostons on 22 August. On 24 August 1941, {{he took his}} total to 142 aerial victories by claiming three LaGG-3 and one Boston. Over {{the course of the}} next four days, he scored one victory on each day, a Boston on 25 August, a Pe-2 on 26 August, a I-16 on 27 August, and another Boston on 28 August. After three victories over LaGG-3s and one Pe-2 on 29 August 1942, he reached 150 aerial victories and became the Luftwaffes highest scoring pilot at that point. For this he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds on 30 August. Gollob was the third member of the Wehrmacht and the third fighter pilot who had received this award. Fearing he would be lost in combat, Hitler imposed a flying ban on him. The next day, he was again mentioned in the Wehrmachtbericht radio report, his third and last of such mentions. Der Adler, a biweekly Nazi propaganda magazine published by the Luftwaffe, also reported his actions in volume 19 of 1942. On 30 September 1942, Gollob was officially replaced in command of JG77 by Hauptmann Joachim Müncheberg. Gollob was then posted to the <b>Stab</b> <b>of</b> Jagdfliegerführer 3 (Jafü3—3rd Fighter Pilot Leader) at Brest-Guipavas on the English Channel Front.|$|E
25|$|Wiese led JG77 in {{the opening}} phase of the {{offensive}} until 25 December 1944, when he was severely injured in a training exercise. Wiese and his wingman, Feldwebel (Sergeant) Hansch, took off at 11:20a.m. on a training flight over German held territory. The plan was {{to meet up with}} I. Gruppe but the two failed to establish contact. Instead, flying at an altitude of , they encountered a flight of Supermarine Spitfires in the vicinity of Bottrop and Essen. In the resulting aerial combat, both Bf109G-14s were shot down, Hansch was killed in action while Wiese bailed out. He came down near Essen-Dellwig. His parachute only opened partially, resulting in a harsh landing, and loss of consciousness. Wiese was taken to a field hospital at Bottrop where he was diagnosed with a concussion and minor skull fracture. He {{spent the rest of the}} winter in hospital, and was replaced as commander by Major Siegfried Freytag. Their victors may have been Spitfires from the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) No. 401 Squadron which claimed two Bf109s from the <b>Stab</b> <b>of</b> JG77 shot down over Duisburg that day. One of these victories was credited to Flying Officer John MacKay.|$|E

500|$|The musicologist Suzanne Cusick {{writes that}} Monteverdi [...] "creat the lament as a {{recognizable}} genre of vocal chamber music {{and as a}} standard scene in opera... that would become crucial, almost genre-defining, to the full-scale public operas of 17th-century Venice". Cusick observes how Monteverdi is able to match in music the [...] "rhetorical and syntactical gestures" [...] {{in the text of}} [...] Ottavio Rinuccini. The opening repeated words [...] "Lasciatemi morire" [...] (Let me die) are accompanied by a dominant seventh chord which Ringer describes as [...] "an unforgettable chromatic <b>stab</b> <b>of</b> pain". Ringer suggests that the lament defines Monteverdi's innovative creativity {{in a manner similar to}} that in which the Prelude and the Liebestod in Tristan und Isolde announced Wagner's discovery of new expressive frontiers.|$|E
500|$|Flies have {{appeared}} in literature {{since at least the}} time of Ancient Greece. The Ancient Greek playwright Aeschylus has a gadfly pursue and torment Io, a maiden associated with the moon, watched constantly by the eyes of the herdsman Argus, associated with all the stars: [...] "Io: Ah! Hah! Again the prick, the <b>stab</b> <b>of</b> gadfly-sting! O earth, earth, hide, the hollow shape—Argus—that evil thing—the hundred-eyed."

In Antony and Cleopatra, Shakespeare similarly likens Cleopatra's hasty departure from the Actium battlefield to that of a cow chased by a gadfly. More recently, in 1962 the biologist Vincent Dethier wrote To Know a Fly, introducing the general reader to the behaviour and physiology of the fly.|$|E

500|$|In its operatic context the lament {{takes the}} form of an {{extended}} recitative of more than 70 vocal lines, delivered in five sections divided by choral comments. Some of the wording is prefigured in the immediately preceding scene in which the First Envoy describes Arianna's plight to a sympathetic chorus of fishermen. The lament depicts Arianna's various emotional reactions to her abandonment: sorrow, anger, fear, self-pity, desolation and a sense of futility. Cusick draws attention to the manner in which Monteverdi is able to match in music the [...] "rhetorical and syntactical gestures" [...] in Rinuccini's text. The opening repeated words [...] "Lasciatemi morire" [...] (Let me die) are accompanied by a dominant seventh chord which Ringer describes as [...] "an unforgettable chromatic <b>stab</b> <b>of</b> pain"; Monteverdi {{was one of the first}} users of this musical device. What follows, says Ringer, has a range and depth [...] "comparable to Shakespeare's most searching soliloquies". The words [...] "Lasciatemi morire" [...] are followed by [...] "O Teseo, O Teseo mio" [...] (O Theseus, my Theseus"); the two phrases represent Arianna's contrasting emotions of despair and longing. Throughout the lament indignation and anger are punctuated by tenderness, until the final iteration of [...] "O Teseo", after which a descending line brings the lament to a quiet conclusion.|$|E
500|$|On 22 July 1942, the Geschwaderkommodore of Jagdgeschwader 52 (JG52—52nd Fighter Wing), Major Herbert Ihlefeld, was {{severely}} {{injured in a}} flight accident and had to surrender command during his convalescence. At the time, all three Gruppen of JG77 were lent out to other units, and Gollob had time to spare, so temporarily took over command of JG52 as acting Geschwaderkommodore. On this {{or one of the}} following days, he departed and flew to the Geschwaderstab of JG52. On 28 June 1942, the Wehrmacht had initiated Fall Blau (Case Blue), the 1942 strategic summer offensive in southern Russia. The objective was to secure the oil fields of Baku as well as an advance in the direction of Stalingrad along the Volga River, to cover the flanks of the advance towards Baku. Tasked with aerial support of this offensive was Luftflotte 4 to which JG52 was subordinated. By the time Gollob joined the Geschwader in late July 1942, the offensive had been renamed Operation Braunschweig and JG52 was located at Rostov-on-Don. Gollob claimed his first victory with the <b>Stab</b> <b>of</b> JG52 on 26 July 1942, a I-16 and his 108th in total. The next day, he shot down two I-153 biplane fighters. He claimed the first aerial victory of August 1942, his last month of combat operations, on 4 August over a Yakovlev Yak-1 fighter aircraft. He was then credited with four victories on 6 August, two Il-2, one Yak-1 and one R-5 took his score to 115 aerial victories. He claimed one Yak-1 on each of the next two days. On 14 August, he was credited with two LaGG-3 and one Douglas A-20 Havoc, referred to as a Boston. For the last time in his combat career, Gollob achieved [...] "ace-in-a-day" [...] for the sixth time on 16 August 1941. That day he claimed two LaGG-3, two I-16 and one Il-2. His success as a fighter pilot continued, as he shot down two LaGG-3 on 17 August, three I-16 on 18 August, and two Il-2 and a I-153 on 19 August, taking his overall total to 133 aerial victories.|$|E

2500|$|Weiß {{was born}} on 25 September 1907 in Breslau—today Wrocław in Poland—at the time a Silesian Province of the Kingdom of Prussia.

He transferred to the Deutsche Verkehrsfliegerschule (German Air Transport School) in Braunschweig for pilot training on 1 March 1933. Weiß transferred to the Luftwaffe on 1 October 1934 holding the rank of Oberleutnant where he initially served as a technical officer with a reconnaissance squadron. From October 1936 to July 1938, now a Hauptmann (Captain), he served on the <b>Stab</b> <b>of</b> Jagdgeschwader 134 [...] "Horst Wessel" [...] (JG 134—134th Fighter Wing).
