Goal of the approach is to guide designers in the selection of the different materials of the blade, while providing indications to composite manufacturers on optimal trade-offs between mechanical properties and material costs.

A mortality rate of approximately 44 % was recorded and the clinical findings included anorexia, lethargy, swollen necks and several unusual vesicles and bullas were present on the legs and <b>shell</b> <b>skin.</b> When the surviving turtles {{reached the age of}} 11 months (October 2009), another {{outbreak of}} this disease occurred in the same pond, resulting in a mortality rate of approximately 20 %. In both outbreaks, histopathological examination revealed typical acute lesions, such as ballooning degeneration and acute cell swelling of keratinocyte 5 of the epidermis. Furthermore, tiny eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusion bodies were observed in the vacuoles. Sloughed necrotic epidermis, inflammatory cells, and a predominance of heterophils were found to have infiltrated the area of the exposed underlying dermis. In addition, patches of skin ulceration and deep layer inflammation were present, and secondary bacterial infection was suspected.

40|$|Stiffened {{shells of}} various {{configurations}} fabricated out of composite materials find extensive applications in aircraft structures. Two distinctive modes of buckling dominate structural response of stiffened panels, viz. the short-wave local mode {{in which the}} <b>shell</b> <b>skin</b> buckles essentially between the stiffeners and the long-wave overall mode in which the <b>shell</b> <b>skin</b> buckles carrying the stiffeners with it. In optimized designs, the critical stresses corresponding to these modes of buckling would be close to each other. This leads to a nonlinear mode interaction which is recognized to be the principal cause {{of the failure of}} stiffened structures. If the structure is subjected to through-the-thickness thermal gradients, then large-wave bending effects would begin to occur well below the overall critical load and these would play the role of overall imperfections. The load carrying capacity would be significantly diminished as a result of interaction of local buckling with overall thermal distortions. The analysis of this problem using standard finite element techniques can be shown to be prohibitively expensive for design iterations. A concept which would greatly facilitate the analysis of mode interaction is advanced. We note that the local buckling occurs in a more or less periodic pattern in a structure having regular spacings of stiffeners. Thus it is a relatively simple matter to analyze the local buckling and the second order effects (which are essential for modeling postbuckling phenomena) using a unit cell of the structure. Once analyzed, these dormations are embedded in a shell element. Thus, a shell element could span several half-waves of local buckling and still be able to depict local buckling effects with requisite accuracy. A major consequence of the interaction of overall buckling/bending is the slow variation of the local buckling amplitude across the structure - the phenomenon of 'amplitude modulation' - and this is accounted for in the present model by letting the scaling parameter of the local mode vary according to a 'slowly varying' function. The construction of the analytical model involves essentially two stages and these are described briefly...|$|R

Sandwich structures can comprise various types of cores and skin materials to create an optimal design for a specific performance target. Composite sandwich structures are used widely in weight-sensitive structures where high flexural rigidity is required, because of the high-specific strength, stiffness, light weight, high thermal insulation, and the capability to be formed into complex geometries (El Demerdash 2013). Typical composite sandwich panels comprise a relatively thin, stiff, and strong <b>skin</b> <b>plate</b> with a relatively thick and light core.
