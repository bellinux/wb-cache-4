Unlike conventional star networks, the pro-posed network {{is divided into}} several delta regions, each containing only one feeder fiber. This delta-star structure significantly reduces the complexity and implementation cost of conventional star net-works. A concatenated dual-ring structure with the self-healing function is designed to overcome the star’s weakness in reliability. Numerous <b>sensor</b> <b>ring</b> subnets (SRSNs) are utilized to serve {{a large number of}} fiber Bragg grating sensors. Delta regions are parti-tioned upon the criterion of inter-region traffic uniformization; this simplifies the interrogation process and time slot assignment. The reconfigurable function for this multipoint sensor network, which is based on the optical switching technique, is utilized to en-sure service continuity when fibers fail. The protection mechanism is illustrated with several multiple link failure cases. Finally, an ex-perimental network is implemented to demonstrate the feasibility and survivability of the proposed sensor network.

40|$|Offshore {{foundations}} for wind turbines {{are expected to}} increase in significance over the coming years. Various wind parks are already producing energy {{and there are many}} more planned or currently being built. The maintenance of these offshore wind turbines is challenging due to the limited accessibility and expensive logistics. Currently, 25 % of these structures have to be evaluated each year regarding their condition and stability. For this task, welded seams are the focus of interest. At the moment, they are visually inspected by divers; in the oil and gas industry, the alternating current field measurement (ACFM) technique is used as well. None of these are applicable on the inside of jackets, for example, due to safety issues. Visible inspection is often limited by the sight conditions and ACFM can only measure directly under the sensor. The Fraunhofer IKTS has therefore developed a transducer ring to be placed permanently on the foundations of offshore wind turbines. It is particularly well suited for the monitoring of jackets. The measurement device, CoMoSeam, has been successfully tested underwater. Furthermore, an artificially-initialised crack could be detected and located correctly. The investigation is realised by guided waves, which have a lower frequency range than the commonly used ultrasound techniques. The advantage lies in the reduced number of sensors compared to NDT ultrasound techniques, which also leads to a lower resolution. Nevertheless, the resolution is decreased but is still far better than that achieved by the currently used inspection methods. This paper presents the hardware used for building the <b>sensor</b> <b>ring</b> as well as the measurement technique. The lamination required to ensure that the equipment is waterproof is especially challenging due to the large diameters demanded for offshore platforms. To detect cracks correctly, even in harsh environments, sophisticated data processing is necessary to automatically eliminate all obviously incorrect data.

30|$|We {{used the}} {{experiment}} without a hydraulic head, i.e., without (ground)water flow, {{to adjust the}} thermal properties of the sandbox model. From this, we obtained a thermal conductivity of approximately 2.8  W m− 1  K− 1 and a water heat capacity of 2  MJ K− 1  m− 3 for the filling material of the sandbox, medium-grained sand with a porosity of approximately 30 %. These values match those obtained from laboratory measurements of sand samples. For the Thermocem® cement, which is in between the two TSM tubes, we used a porosity of 10 % and assumed, as plastic tubes enclose it, a very low permeability of 10 − 19 m 2. Its thermal conductivity and heat capacity were 2  W m− 1  K− 1 and 2  MJ K− 1  m− 3, respectively. Its thermal conductivity strongly influenced the temperature gradient of our measurement.

40|$|The seismic {{waves that}} spread {{out from the}} {{earthquake}} source to the entire Earth are usually measured at the ground surface by a seismometer which consists of three orthogonal components (Z (vertical), N (north-south), and E (east-west) or R (radial), T (transversal), and Z (vertical)). However, a complete representation of the ground motion induced by earthquakes consists not only of those three components of translational motion, but also three components of rotational motion plus six components of strain. Altough theoretical seismologists have pointed out {{the potential benefits of}} measurements of rotational ground motion, they were not made until quite recently. This was mainly because precise instruments to measure ground rotational motion were not available. The measurement of rotational motion induced by earthquakes is relatively new in the field of seismology. To the best of our knowledge, the first experiment to measure ground rotational motion using rotational sensor was done by Nigbor (1994 }. He successfully measured translational and rotational ground motion during an underground chemical explosion experiment at the Nevada Test Site using a triaxial translational accelerometer and a solid-state rotational velocity sensor. The same type of sensor was also used by Takeo (1998 } for recording an earthquake swarm on Izu peninsula, Japan. However, because of the limitation of the instrument sensitivity, this kind of sensor was only able to sensing the rotational ground motion near the earthquake sources of other artificial sources. Another type of rotational sensor was assembled using two oppositely oriented seismometers. This is possible since in principle the rotational component of the ground motions is equal to half the curl of the ground velocity. This kind of sensor was intensively researched and developed by the seismology group in Institute of geophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences. However, they report several problems especially due to the small differences in the seismometer's response function. Like the solid state rotational sensors, this sensor was only able to measure rotational motion near the seismic sources. The application of the Sagnac effect for sensing the inertial rotation using optical devices were intensively investigated, since the advent of lasers in the sixties. However, the first application of a ring laser gyroscope as a rotational sensor applied in the field of seismology was reported by Stedman et al. (1995 }. Fully consistent rotational motions were recorded by a ring laser gyro installed at the fundamental station Wettzell, Germany (Igel et al., 2005). They showed that the rotational motions were compatible with collocated recordings of transverse acceleration by a standard seismometer, both in amplitude and phase. They mentioned that "standard" rotational sensors with sufficient resolution may be possible in the near future. Among the other type of rotational <b>sensor,</b> <b>ring</b> lasers seem more reliable in seismic applications since it has been provenable to sensing the ground rotational motion from near source as well as teleseismic earthquake events with a broad magnitude range (Igel et al., 2007 }. In earthquake engineering, observations of rotational components of seismic strong motions may be of interest as this type of motion may contribute to the response of structures to earthquake-induced ground shaking. Most of rotational/torsional studies of ground motion in earthquake engineering are so far still carried out by indirect measurements. It can be done since the rotational component of motion is a linear combination of the space derivatives of the horizontal component of the motion. However, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, there are no comparison of array-derived rotation rate and direct measurement from rotational sensors mentioned in the literature. The first objective of my thesis is to study the effect of noise and various uncertainties to the derivation of rotation rate and to compare directly the result with the ring laser data. Here we present for the first time a comparison of rotational ground motions derived from seismic array with those observed directly with ring laser. Our study suggest that - given accurate measurements of translational motions in an array of appropriate size and number of stations - the array-derived rotation rate may be very close to the "true" rotational signal that would be measured at the center of the array (or the specific reference station). However, it is important to note that it may be dangerous to use only the minimally required three stations as even relatively small noise levels may deteriorate the rotation estimates. Furthermore, it is clear that the logistic effort to determine rotations from array is considerably larger than direct measurements. In the light of this, the necessity to develop field-deployable rotational sensors with the appropriate resolution for use in local and regional seismology remains an outstanding issue. More recently, Igel et al. (2005) introduced a method to estimate the horizontal phase velocity by using collocated measurements from a ring laser and seismometer. A simple relationship between transverse acceleration and rotation rate (around a vertical axis) shows that both signals should be in phase and their ratio proportional to horizontal phase velocity. Comparison with synthetic traces (rotations and translations) and phase velocities determined in the same way showed good agreement with the observations. The second objective of my thesis is to study the accuracy of phase velocity determination using collocated measurement of rotational and translational motion and derive the Love wave dispersion curve using spectral ratio for both synthetic and real observed data. Whether the accuracy of the dispersion curves derived with the approach presented in this thesis is enough for tomographic purposes remains to be evaluated. Nevertheless, the results shown here indicate that through additional measurements of accurate rotational signals, wavefield information is accessible that otherwise requires seismic array data. However, to make this methodology practically useful for seismology will require the development of an appropriate high-resolution six-component broadband sensor. Efforts are underway to coordinate such developments on an international scale (Evans et al., 2006). The ground tilt is generally small but not negligible in seismology, especially in the strong-motion earthquake. It is well known that the tilt signal is most noticeable in the horizontal components of the seismometer. Ignoring the tilt effects leads to unreliable results, especially in calculation of permanent displacements and long-period calculations. The third objective of my thesis is to study the array-derived tilt, a further application of measuring tilt. An interesting result concerning tilt study based on a synthetic study is the possibility to derive the Rayleigh wave phase velocity as well as Rayleigh wave dispersion curve from collocated measurement of tilt rate and translational motions. The synthetic study shows that there is a frequency dependent phase velocity from collocated radial acceleration and transverse tilt...|$|E

A completely cement-filled TSM cannot be disassembled and separated from the BHE tubes. Hence, water flow affected the interior sensors of the TSM prototype.|$|R

Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) wire <b>ring</b> <b>sensors</b> have been proposed and demonstrated successfully in laboratory conditions previously. Here it is proposed that the <b>ring</b> <b>sensor</b> is used in a modified configuration: a flexible hose instrumented with the <b>ring</b> <b>sensor</b> {{is connected to the}} pipe, via a fire hydrant or other standard access point. Some theoretical modelling has been carried out, which predicts that the acoustic pressure in the main pipe transmits well into the sidebranch, whilst the pressure in the main pipe is largely unaffected. This suggests that PVDF wire located on the sidebranch will effectively monitor the pressure in the main pipe. Moreover, if the sidebranch is sufficiently flexible, substantial sensitivity gains can be made using this configuration compared with locating the wire on the main pipe. Measurements made in the laboratory on a medium density polyethylene (MDPE) finite pipe with a polythene sidebranch connected to it confirm that the acoustic pressure in the main pipe can indeed be measured on the sidebranch. The expected sensitivity gains were not fully realized, and a number of different reasons for this are proposed...|$|R

Significant new national security technologies were developed at the Center that included MEMS acceleration <b>sensors</b> and <b>ring</b> laser gyroscopes for smart weapons, incorporation of advanced information technology into high performance fighter aircraft, and stealth technology for the B-2 bomber. An Air Force Systems Command initiative on complex software systems managed using systematic software engineering processes was also implemented. In 1990, became TRW's Vice President of Technology for the Space and Defense Sector - which undertook defense conversion efforts following collapse of the USSR.|$|R

5000|$|If all {{contacts}} {{are placed}} at the same angular position, then 9 tracks are needed to get a standard BRGC with at least 1 degree accuracy. However, if the manufacturer moves a contact to a different angular position (but at the same distance from the center shaft), then the corresponding [...] "ring pattern" [...] needs to be rotated the same angle to give the same output. If the most significant bit (the inner ring in Figure 1) is rotated enough, it exactly matches the next ring out. Since both rings are then identical, the inner ring can be cut out, and the <b>sensor</b> for that <b>ring</b> moved to the remaining, identical ring (but offset at that angle from the other <b>sensor</b> on that <b>ring).</b> Those two <b>sensors</b> on a single ring make a quadrature encoder. That reduces the number of tracks for a [...] "1 degree resolution" [...] angular encoder to 8 tracks. Reducing the number of tracks still further can't be done with BRGC.|$|R
40|$|International audienceFor {{maritime}} applications like offshore {{foundations of}} wind turbines, durable sensors and sensor systems with low noise levels are needed which are {{well suited for}} the harsh environmental conditions. Additionally, the restricted offshore repair opportunities and therefore {{the urgent need for}} high reliability have to be taken into account. In order to monitor welded seams in these applications areas, <b>sensor</b> <b>rings</b> were tested and qualified. Sensors are positioned in a ring around the pipe. The area of the welded seam is investigated by ultrasonic waves. Especially the correct positioning of the damage demands for highly sophisticated processing algorithms which are able to reconstruct the damage reliably from the recorded signals. The present paper introduces a technique to localize cracks in cylindrical structures. The proposed technique is based on the use of elastic waves propagating in hollow cylinders The so-called guided waves are used in a variety of wave modes. Every wave mode induces a different interaction potential with a crack depending on frequency and elastic stress components. Using the Finite difference method, the time-dependent elastic problem is solved by the simulation software Wave 3000 Plus to determine well-suited wave modes and frequency domains for the interaction of waves with the expected cracks. Subsequently, measurements using a cylindrical test structure were performed to verify the simulation results. Varying wave modes provide differing main oscillation directions and require the usage of shear transducers and thickness crystal transducers. Furthermore, the synthetic superposition technique is approved by experiments on cracks with varying depth...|$|R
