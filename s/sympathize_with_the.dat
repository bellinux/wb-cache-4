5|$|Shea's {{relationship}} with the engineers at North American was a difficult one. While Shea blamed North American's management for the continuing difficulties {{in the development of}} the command module, project leader Harrison Storms felt that NASA itself was far from blameless. It had delayed in making key design decisions, and persisted in making significant changes to the design once construction had begun. While Shea did his part in attempting to control the change requests, Storms felt that he did not understand or <b>sympathize</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> inevitable problems involved in the day-to-day work of manufacturing.|$|E
5|$|Somewhere premiered at the 67th Venice International Film Festival {{where it}} {{received}} the Golden Lion {{award for best}} picture. Critical opinion was mildly positive. Reviewers praised the patience of the film's visual style and its empathy {{for a handful of}} characters, but some found Somewhere to be too repetitive of themes in Coppola's previous work, or did not <b>sympathize</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> protagonist because of his relative success. It was released to theaters in the United Kingdom and Ireland on December 10, 2010, and in the United States on December 22, 2010.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, {{the empire}} became divided in a {{struggle}} that was less a rebellion against the established government and more a contest for the throne between equal contenders. Michael held Constantinople and the European provinces, controlled the imperial bureaucracy, and had been properly crowned by the Patriarch, but {{he had come to}} the throne through murder, while Thomas gained support and legitimacy through his claim to avenge the fallen Leo, and he won the backing of themes both in Asia and later in Europe. Thomas was a well-known, popular, and respected figure in Asia Minor, where Leo V had enjoyed considerable support. Michael, on the other hand, was virtually unknown outside the capital; his military record was unremarkable, he was uneducated and coarse of manner, his stutter earned him ridicule, and he was reputed to <b>sympathize</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> heretical religious sect of the Athinganoi, to which his family had belonged.|$|E

5|$|Peng enlisted as {{a private}} second class, with a monthly wage of 5.5 yuan, 2 yuan of which he sent back to support his family. Within seven months he was {{promoted}} to private first class, with a monthly wage of 6 yuan, 3 yuan of which he sent to his family. One of Peng's commanding officers was an idealistic Nationalist who had participated in the 1911 Xinhai Revolution, who influenced Peng to <b>sympathize</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Kuomintang goals of social reform and national reunification. When another civil war broke out in 1917, Peng's regiment split from the rest of its army and joined the forces of Tang Shengzhi, who was aligned with Tan Yankai and Sun Yat-sen, against those aligned with the northern warlord Wu Peifu. During this period Peng received training in formal tactics from an officer in his brigade. In July 1918 Peng was captured while on a reconnaissance mission behind enemy lines, but was released after two weeks. In April 1919 Peng was promoted to master sergeant and acting platoon commander. Tang Shengzhi's forces drove enemy troops out of Hunan in July 1920, capturing the provincial capital of Changsha.|$|E
5|$|Buddhist traditions provide {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} how this transfer proceeds. Transferring merit to another person, usually deceased relatives, is simply done by a mental wish. Despite the word transfer, the merit of the giver {{is in no way}} decreased during such an act, just like a candle used to light another candle does not diminish. The merit transferred cannot always be received, however. The dead relatives must also be able to <b>sympathize</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> meritorious act. If the relatives do not receive the merit, the act of transferring merit will still be beneficial for the giver himself. The transfer of merit is thus connected with the idea of rejoicing. The other person who rejoices in one's meritorious deeds, in that way also receives merit, if he approves of the merit done. Thus, rejoicing in others' merits, apart from being one of the ten meritorious acts mentioned, is also a prerequisite for the transferring of merit to occur. The purposes for merit transfer differ. In many Buddhist countries, transferring merit is connected to the notion of an intermediate state. The merit that is transferred to the deceased will help them to cross over safely to the next rebirth. Some Mahāyāna traditions believe that it can help deceased relatives to attain the Pure Land. Another way of transferring merit, apart from helping the deceased, is to dedicate it to the devas (deities), since it is believed that these are not able to make merits themselves. In this way it is believed their favor can be obtained. Finally, many Buddhists transfer merits to resolve a bond of revenge that may exist between people, as it is believed that someone else's vengefulness may create harm in one's life.|$|E
25|$|Like clergy, {{civilians were}} {{executed}} in Republican territories. Some civilians were executed as suspected Falangists.

Shopkeepers and industrialists were shot if they did not <b>sympathize</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Republicans, and were usually spared if they did. Fake justice was sought through a commission, known in Russia as checas.|$|E

They tended to <b>sympathize</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Union during the Civil War. The residents in Hackleman's portion of town to the east were made up mostly of working-class Democrats who sided with the Confederacy. The two sides planted a hedge near Baker Street separating their sides of town.|$|E
25|$|Apricot Jam and Other Stories (2010) by Alexander Solzhenitsyn. In a {{short story}} about Marshal Georgii Zhukov's futile {{attempts}} at writing his memoirs, the retired Marshal reminisces about serving against the peasant uprising in Tambov province. He recalls Mikhail Tukhachevsky's arrival to take command of the campaign and his first address to his men. He announced that total war and scorched earth tactics are to be used against civilians who assist or even <b>sympathize</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> peasant rebels. Zhukov proudly recalls how Tukhachevsky's tactics were adopted and succeeded in breaking the uprising. In the process, however, they virtually depopulated the surrounding countryside.|$|E

He agreed and was joined by a Somali fleet, which began attacking Portuguese colonies in Southeast Africa.|$|E

Despite this, Shannon calls Brendon {{the next day and}} invites him, Jason, and their friend Melissa to his {{birthday}} party, which Brendon resentfully accepts. When the kids arrive at Shannon's party, they see that no one has arrived. Shannon laments about how his bullying ways have caused no one he knows to actually like him, and the kids <b>sympathize</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> bully. However, Shannon then reveals that there are several kids at the party, who come out from hiding spots and ridicule Brendon, Jason, and Melissa for being swindled. As their retaliation, the children steal Shannon's lawn gnome and depart from the party.|$|E
25|$|According {{to media}} reports, {{prosecutor}} Marcia Clark thought that women, regardless of race, would <b>sympathize</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> domestic violence {{aspect of the}} case and connect with her personally. On the other hand, the defense's research suggested that women generally were more likely to acquit than men, and that jurors did not respond well to Clark's combative style of litigation. The defense also speculated that black women would not be as sympathetic as white women to the victim, who was white, because of tensions about interracial marriages. Both sides accepted a disproportionate number of female jurors. From an original jury pool of 40% white, 28% black, 17% Hispanic, and 15% Asian, the final jury for the trial had 10 women and two men, of which there were nine blacks, two whites, and one Hispanic.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{economic}} growth and success in diplomatic relations, the government that gained power by coup d'etat was essentially a military regime and the public's support and trust in it was low when the promises for democratic reform never materialized. In the 1985 National Assembly elections, opposition parties won more votes than the government party, clearly indicating that the public wanted a change. Many started to <b>sympathize</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> protesting students. The Gwangju Massacre was never forgotten and in January 1987, when a protesting Seoul National University student died under police interrogation, public fury was immense. In April 1987, President Chun made a declaration that measures would be taken to protect the current constitution, instead of reforming it {{to allow for the}} direct election of the president. This announcement consolidated and strengthened the opposition; in June 1987, more than a million students and citizens participated in the nationwide anti-government protests of the June Democracy Movement.|$|E

25|$|After the {{revolution}} radicalized further and headed towards terror, Charlotte Corday began to <b>sympathize</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Girondins. She admired their speeches and grew fond {{of many of}} the Girondist groups whom she met while living in Caen. She respected the political principles of the Girondins and came to align herself with their thinking. She regarded them as a movement that would ultimately save France. The Gironde represented a more moderate approach to {{the revolution}} and they, like Corday, were skeptical about the direction the revolution was taking. They opposed the Montagnards, who advocated a more radical approach to the revolution, which included the extreme idea that the only way the revolution would survive invasion and civil war was through terrorizing and executing those opposed to it. The opposition to this radical thinking, coupled with the influence of the Gironde, ultimately led Corday to carry out her plan to murder the most radical of them all, Jean-Paul Marat.|$|E
25|$|The student {{movement}} began to coalesce after the government's assault on Vocational School #5, which {{marked the first}} major infringement on student autonomy. The movement began to gain support from students outside the capital and from other segments of society, which continued to build until that October. Students formed brigadas (brigades), groups of six or more students who distributed leaflets about the issues in the streets, markets, and most often on public buses. These parochial organizations, the smallest units of the CNH, decided the scope and issues which the {{student movement}} would take up. These included both rural and urban concerns. The brigadistas would board buses {{to speak to the}} passengers about the government's corruption and repression, while others distributed leaflets and collected donations. Eventually, the passengers and bus drivers began to <b>sympathize</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> students’ demands for democracy and justice, and the students collected increasing amounts of money. But the aggressive militancy among the students began to disillusion some bus drivers about the students’ motives, and they suspected the youths of seeking power for its own sake.|$|E

Bey agreed and was joined by a Somali fleet, which began attacking Portuguese colonies in Southeast Africa. The Somali-Ottoman offensive managed to drive out the Portuguese from several important cities such as Pate, Mombasa and Kilwa. However, the Portuguese governor sent envoys to India requesting a large Portuguese fleet. This request was answered and it reversed the previous offensive of the Muslims into one of defense. The Portuguese armada managed to re-take most of the lost cities and began punishing their leaders. However, they refrained from attacking Mogadishu.|$|E

25|$|Penniman {{must have}} had {{abundant}} opportunity to know Allen’s character. It would seem that she turned against the Toryism of her step-father and her own British ancestry, to <b>sympathize</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> settlers in their struggle for freedom and for statehood. But though she doubtless admired Ethan Allen's bravery, {{it is said that}} she was repelled by his rough manners and his tincture of infidelity, and possibly by his family of children, and hesitated for some time before yielding to his wooing. However, after their marriage she had great influence over him though she could not entirely cure him of the convivial habits common to the period. This is illustrated by the story of his watch which she insisted must be found every morning hanging on a certain nail as evidence that he had returned home the night before in a condition to make connection between the nail and the ring of his watch. In the spring of 1787, the Allens removed to Burlington, Vermont he having purchased the farm later known as the Van Ness farm north of the city, still later converted into Ethan Allen Park. They spent the first few months in the family of a Mr. Collins at “The Bay,” as the little settlement on the Lake was called, where there were then only three or four families. Here, their younger son Hannibal was born.|$|E
