50|$|Where {{particularly}} poor background contrast {{cannot be}} avoided, a <b>sighting</b> <b>board</b> (usually painted white) {{can be placed}} behind the arm to provide adequate contrast which improves visibility. Alternatively, part of a bridge abutment conveniently located behind a signal may be painted white.|$|E

60|$|Soon after, the English crew went to quarters; and as {{they stood}} up at their guns, all along the main-deck, a row of beef-fed Britons, stalwart-looking fellows, I was struck with the {{contrast}} they afforded to similar <b>sights</b> on <b>board</b> of the Neversink.|$|R
60|$|But {{less than}} an hour afterwards, while {{crossing}} the Place Mollard, I caught <b>sight</b> of him <b>boarding</b> a South Shore tramcar.|$|R
40|$|Animals may {{select the}} microhabitats they use in {{response}} to a real or perceived risk of attack by visually hunting predators. However, to demonstrate this requires measuring visual cover at the microhabitat level, which can be labor-intensive and may require specialized equipment. Simpler methods lack repeatability, particularly when multiple observers are involved. We devised, and describe here, the quadrant cover method (QCM), which provides rapid, objective assessment of the degree of concealment that microhabitats provide from visual predators. Our method gives results that correlate strongly with those obtained using a conventional <b>sight</b> <b>board,</b> but requires less than 25 % of the time. The method is highly repeatable, with negligible observer bias. The QCM is ideal in microhabitat studies in which the variable of interest is visual exposure to other animals such as predators. © The Ecological Society of Japan 2009...|$|R
5000|$|On 25 February 1917, she was <b>sighted</b> and <b>boarded</b> by the German {{commerce}} raider [...] Unusually, the Germans then {{allowed her}} to proceed because being Danish, she was a neutral ship. This {{was something of a}} lucky escape, because within weeks Germany would return to unrestricted marine warfare, a tactic that would have meant the ship's indefinite sinking.|$|R
50|$|The organization's {{identity}} has been closely aligned with its founder Mildred Weisenfeld, {{who lost her}} vision to retinitis pigmentosa two years before starting the nonprofit. Weisenfeld lead the organization as Executive Director for 50 years, from 1946-1996. Among other notable leaders at Fight for <b>Sight</b> were <b>board</b> president Herbert Tenzer, {{who had been a}} member of the United States House of Representatives, and comedian Bob Hope who was an honorary chairman from 1960. Other honorary board members included Milton Berle, Ed Sullivan and Sammy Davis, Jr.|$|R
50|$|The Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) {{station on}} Ottawa Street (Hwy #7) in Havelock {{was built in}} 1929. It was {{designated}} in 1991 as a Heritage Railway Station by the Historic <b>Sights</b> and Monuments <b>Board,</b> Parks Canada. In 2004 the Station was purchased and renovated to accommodate restaurants.|$|R
25|$|Another {{account of}} this story was {{published}} in 1929. In this account the Marlborough was found adrift in January 1899 by the ship British Isles under Captain Hadrop. The British Isles was purportedly sailing from Lyttleton to England. She was a little north of Cape Horn by Staten Island when the Marlborough was <b>sighted</b> and <b>boarded.</b> This story was discounted {{because there were no}} reports of the British Isles visiting Lyttleton in the time period, and it was improbable that Hadrop would have waited so many years to report the sighting.|$|R
50|$|One {{option was}} to keep the {{terminal}} as is. The consulting group did not recommend this as the terminal has too many structural and safety problems. The list of problems include: mold growth, roof leakage, differential settlement, blocking runway line of <b>sight,</b> passenger <b>boarding,</b> potential equipment damage from basement flooding, outdated electrical and mechanical systems, no sprinkler system, code deficiencies, insufficient parking setback, and interior traffic circulation issues. The terminal could be rehabilitated for $18.3 million, however, that would leave many issues unresolved and leave no room for expansion.|$|R
50|$|The film opens {{aboard a}} U-boat as it returns from a mission. It then follows the crew onshore {{the day before}} they ship off for their next mission—meeting their family and sweethearts, {{spending}} a last night at a club, and so forth. Then they ship off, soon <b>sighting</b> and <b>boarding</b> a Dutch merchant ship, which they inspect for contraband. The boarding of the ship is shown being done professionally and in a non-confrontational manner. While they are aboard the Dutch ship, a Royal Navy ship spots them and tries to torpedo them, but the U-boat ends up sinking it.|$|R
50|$|Two days later, Sage, with , YMS-262, and YMS-383, was {{detached}} from the formation. Proceeding to Wide Pass, they commenced sweeping operations at 0617; and, at 0726, entered the lagoon. An hour and one half later, they <b>sighted</b> personnel on <b>board</b> a beached Japanese ship. After shelling the ship, they resumed sweeping operations and added patrol duties which continued until mid-March.|$|R
5000|$|In 1910 {{he moved}} to Cologne and from there, {{travelled}} and toured extensively, mainly in the Americas, playing matches against local champions and exhibiting his legendary skills as a player of simultaneous blindfold chess. At New York in 1916, he once played twenty opponents without <b>sight</b> of a <b>board</b> and won nineteen games and drew one, while engaging in polite conversation with opponents and spectators.|$|R
5000|$|After {{bringing}} her prize into Key West, Florida, on 19 November, William G. Anderson set sail a week later. She cruised off Puerto Rico, Cuba, Bermuda, and the Windward Islands into {{the spring of}} the following year. She <b>sighted</b> 210 vessels, <b>boarded</b> 66, and had found Confederate privateers, in her commander's words, [...] "rare during that time." [...] She concluded that cruise at the Boston Navy Yard on 16 April 1862.|$|R
50|$|Anthony Hamilton (born 18 February 1969 in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire) is {{a former}} British Paralympic athlete who {{represented}} the United Kingdom at the 1988 and 1992 Paralympic games. He was the winner of two gold medals for the 800m and 1500m at the 1988 games, where he broke the world record for the fastest time over 1500m. In 1992 he bronze for the 1500m. Hamilton is partially <b>sighted</b> and <b>boarded</b> at Exhall Grange School near Coventry. He was still at school when he first represented his country. Away from athletics he trained as a teacher, and has taught geography at schools around the Midlands. Hamilton was seconded to Birmingham Local Authority to support schools in an Ofsted category before becoming headmaster of George Dixon Academy in 2009.|$|R
60|$|The next day, {{while the}} storm was blowing itself out, Wolf Larsen and I crammed anatomy and surgery and set Mugridge’s ribs. Then, when the storm broke, Wolf Larsen cruised {{back and forth over}} that portion of the ocean where we had {{encountered}} it, and somewhat more to the westward, while the boats were being repaired and new sails made and bent. Sealing schooner after sealing schooner we <b>sighted</b> and <b>boarded,</b> most of which were in search of lost boats, and most of which were carrying boats and crews they had picked up and which did not belong to them. For the thick of the fleet had been to the westward of us, and the boats, scattered far and wide, had headed in mad flight for the nearest refuge.|$|R
50|$|Guide Dogs {{relies on}} many volunteers, key roles filled by volunteers include puppy walking (where puppy walkers take a pup {{into their home}} for 12 to 14 months and help {{familiarise}} it with everyday <b>sights</b> and sounds), <b>boarding</b> (those who look after trainee guide dogs in the evenings and at weekends), breeding stock holders (those who look after the brood bitches and stud dogs), drivers, branch roles (such as branch treasurer or branch supporter), and fundraising.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{good day}} to you, major, and a hearty welcome to the open air!" [...] cried the sturdy yeoman, frankly but respectfully, {{offering}} his hand. [...] "You fell into a pit here, or into a den among thieves; and it's downright providential you e'er saw and breathed the clear air ag'in! Wa-a-l, I've been trailin' a little this mornin' along with the Injin; and no hound has a more sartain scent than he has. We went into the hollow along the creek; and a desp'rate <b>sight</b> of <b>boards</b> them varmints have got into the water, I can tell you! If the lot's worth forty pounds York, it must be worth every shilling of five hundred. They'd 'a' made their fortin's, every blackguard among 'em. I don't know but I'd fit myself to save so many boards, and sich beautiful boards, whether wrongfully or rightfully lumbered!" ...|$|R
50|$|Now that {{completion}} of the construction phase was in <b>sight,</b> the <b>Board</b> gave consideration to the working of the line. The G&SWR were approached and agreed {{to do so for}} 75% of gross receipts; this figure was thought excessive and talks were opened with Thomas Wheatley, who was successfully working the Wigtownshire Railway. Wheatley advised them to procure rolling stock and work the line themselves, but the Directors did not feel confident in that arrangement, so they approached the Caledonian Railway (CR), which was working the Portpatrick Railway. The CR was losing money on the Portpatrick Railway work and politely declined, assuming that the G&PJR would turn back to Wheatley. However this course was not developed and the G&PJR concluded an agreement with the G&SWR to work their line. The CR were alarmed at this: Wheatley, as a small-time independent was not a threat: the G&SWR were a deadly rival.|$|R
50|$|Action {{continued}} after nightfall, and by 1840 hours, {{the ground}} and air elements of the 3d AD could report over 20 tanks, 14 APCs, several trucks and some artillery pieces destroyed. Unfortunately, that same evening, the 4th Battalion, 32d Armor lost the division's first casualties in a Bradley Fighting Vehicle to 25mm cannon fire - with two soldiers killed and three wounded. During the night, both darkness and sandstorms hampered soldiers' visibility, but thermal <b>sighting</b> systems on <b>board</b> the M1A1 Abrams tanks and Bradleys allowed gunners to knock out Iraqi targets.|$|R
2500|$|In Savage Dragon/Destroyer Duck #1 (Nov. 1996), Gerber {{claims that}} Howard and Beverly Switzler changed {{their names to}} Leonard the Duck and Rhonda Martini, {{remained}} in the Image Universe and [...] "were last <b>sighted</b> in Chicago <b>boarding</b> the Amtrak for Buffalo" [...] while the duck who returned to Marvel is [...] "only an empty trademark, a clone whose soul departed him {{at the corner of}} Floss and Regret". This was done because Tom Brevoort invited Gerber to write the comic, claiming {{he was the only one}} to write Howard, then Gerber noticed the Howard guest appearances in Ghost Rider and Generation X and felt as though he had been tricked.|$|R
6000|$|... "The modern {{feats of}} {{blindfold}} play (without <b>sight</b> of <b>board)</b> greatly surpass those of twenty years ago. Paul Morphy, the American, {{was the first}} who made an especial study {{of this kind of}} display, playing some seven or eight games blindfold and simultaneously against various inferior opponents, and making lucrative exhibitions in this way. His abilities in this line created a scare among other rivals who had not practised this test of memory. Since his day many chess-players who are gifted with strong and clear memory and power of picturing to the mind the ideal board and men, have carried this branch of exhibition play far beyond Morphy's pitch; and, contemporaneously with this development, it has become acknowledged that skill in blindfold play is not an absolute test of similarly relative powers over the board: e.g. Blackburne and Zukertort can play as many as sixteen, or even twenty, blindfold games at a time, and win about 80 per cent of them at least. Steinitz, who beats them both in match play, does not essay more than six blindfold at a time. Mason does not, to our knowledge, make any spécialité at all of this sort." ...|$|R
50|$|However, Jeddah did not sink. Her {{passengers}} later {{reported that}} after the captain's lifeboat had been launched, the second mate had tried to escape in another lifeboat {{along with a few}} passengers. The other passengers had prevented this, and in the confusion that ensured, the lifeboat fell into the water, drowning the second mate and two passengers on board the lifeboat with him. Thereafter the remaining 20 crew members, including two officers, {{with the help of the}} passengers, bailed the water out of the ship's engine room. They then hoisted distress signals, which the French passenger steamship Antenor, sailing from Shanghai to London with 680 passengers on <b>board,</b> <b>sighted</b> while Jeddah′s passengers and crew were trying to beach Jeddah off Ras Feeluk, near Bandar Maryah. Antenor approached Jeddah, assisted Jeddah′s crew and passengers in making her stable, and then towed her into the port of Aden, where she arrived on 11 August to much astonishment. Almost all the pilgrims had survived.|$|R
2500|$|The next day, Racoon {{captured}} another privateer, in {{this case}} after a fight. At 10 p.m. Racoon was {{about five or six}} miles south of Dover when she <b>sighted</b> a lugger <b>boarding</b> a brig. Racoon set off in pursuit and after 40 minutes of a running fight came alongside and exchanged further fire with the quarry. The French vessel sustained so much damage that he had to strike. The privateer was the Intrepide, of 16 guns and 60 men under the command of Citizen Suillard. He had sailed from Boulogne at 4 p.m. the previous day. In the engagement the French had thirteen men killed and wounded; Racoon had two men slightly wounded, one of them being Lloyd, who was wounded in the head by a half-pike, though not dangerously. Racoon was too damaged for Lloyd to be able to pursue the brig the privateer had captured. The brig was the Welcombe, and she had been sailing from London to Plymouth with malt. Lloyd stated that he [...] "derived particular Pleasure to have deprived the Enemy of a Vessel which they considered the largest and best Sailer from Calais".|$|R
25|$|During {{a search}} among Mrs McGinty's possessions, Poirot finds a {{newspaper}} from which an {{article has been}} cut out. The newspaper is dated {{a few days before}} the murder. He later discovers that the missing article is about women connected with famous murder cases, and includes photographs of them. He also discovers that Mrs McGinty had purchased a bottle of ink in a local shop shortly before her murder. He concludes that she had recognised one of the women in the article, and had written to the paper in question. Someone must have found out about it and then killed her to prevent her from talking. Poirot and Spence, using the ages of people in the town, conclude that someone is either Lily Gamboll, who committed murder with a meat cleaver as a child, or Eva Kane, who had been the love interest who inspired a man to murder his wife and bury her in a cellar. Another possibility is that someone is Evelyn Hope, the daughter of Eva Kane. Shortly afterwards, Poirot discovers the murder weapon, a sugar hammer, left around in plain <b>sight</b> at his <b>boarding</b> house and accessible to all the suspects. In an attempt to flush out the murderer, Poirot claims to know more than he does and is nearly pushed under an oncoming train. Poirot decides to show most of the suspects the photos at a party. Mrs Upward claims to have seen the photo of Lily Gamboll, but does not say where.|$|R
6000|$|What {{was the use}} of a Colonel {{without a}} regiment? The Governor and Council who had made such a parade of thanks in endowing me with mine, were away out of <b>sight,</b> skulking on <b>board</b> ships, with an {{occasional}} piracy and arson on shore. My Lord Dunmore's black allies frightened away those of his own blood; and besides these negroes whom he had summoned round him in arms, we heard that he had sent an envoy among the Indians of the South, and that they were to come down in numbers and tomahawk our people into good behaviour. [...] "And these are to be our allies!" [...] I say to my mother, exchanging ominous looks with her, and remembering, with a ghastly distinctness, that savage whose face glared over mine, and whose knife was at my throat when Florac struck him down on Braddock's Field. We put our house of Castlewood into as good a state of defence as we could devise; but, in truth, it was more of the red men and the blacks than of the rebels we were afraid. I never saw my mother lose courage but once, and then when she was recounting to us the particulars of our father's death in a foray of Indians more than forty years ago. Seeing some figures one night moving in front of our house, nothing could persuade the good lady but that they were savages, and she sank on her knees crying out, [...] "The Lord have mercy upon us! The Indians--the Indians!" ...|$|R
