[...] Benioff also alluded to the many references and foreshadowing throughout the series that preceded the reveal of the Children creating the White Walkers, saying, [...] "There are certain symbols and patterns that recur throughout the show. The first time we saw {{that was one of the}} very first scenes in the pilot, when Will the ranger sees the Wildling body parts in an odd pattern displayed by the White Walkers. We <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> north of the Wall with the dead horses displayed in a spiral pattern, and then you <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> here and see where these patterns come from, that they're ancient symbols of the Children of the Forest used in their rituals, and the Children of the Forest created the White Walkers." ...|$|E
500|$|Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian was disappointed, {{arguing that}} [...] "All the story's power {{is allowed to}} leak away by the deliberative {{heaviness}} with which Rivette pads through his 150-minute narrative, with its exasperating lack of dramatic emphasis." [...] Philip French noted similarities to Hitchcock's Vertigo and Jean Cocteau's Orphée, but called it [...] "surprisingly flat and unmagical". The New York Times also found it [...] "dry and overdetermined," [...] and Time Out complained that it [...] "never supplies the frissons expected of a ghost story or the emotional draw of a good love story." [...] Film 4 compared it to The Sixth Sense and The Others, but said that [...] "its glacially slow pace will frustrate {{all but the most}} patient". (Rivette said when promoting the film that [...] "I like The Sixth Sense because the final twist doesn't challenge everything that went before it. You can <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> which I did, and it's a second film that's just as logical as the first one. But the end of The Others made the rest of it meaningless.") [...] "An intellectual exercise in metaphysical romance - Ghost for art-house audiences" [...] was Empire wry take. The Digital Fix argued that Rivette's direction resulted in a product that [...] "if never exactly dull and certainly the work of a master, is ultimately an empty film that has nothing to offer but its own cleverness". Keith Uhlich of Slant Magazine found it was [...] "a lesser Rivette offering — a watchable, ultimately unfulfilling ghost story".|$|E

500|$|Bova, like Campbell, was a technophile with a {{scientific}} background, and he declared {{early in his}} tenure that he wanted Analog to {{continue to focus on}} stories with {{a scientific}} foundation, though he also made it clear that change was inevitable. [...] Over his first few months some long-time readers sent in letters of complaint when they judged that Bova was not living up to Campbell's standards, particularly when sex scenes began to appear. [...] On one occasion—Jack Wodhams' story [...] "Foundling Fathers", and its accompanying illustration by Kelly Freas—it turned out that Campbell had bought the story in question. [...] As the 1970s went on, Bova continued to publish authors such as Anderson, Dickson, and Christopher Anvil, who had appeared regularly during Campbell's tenure, but he also attracted authors who {{had not been able to}} sell to Campbell, such as Gene Wolfe, Roger Zelazny, and Harlan Ellison. [...] Frederik Pohl, who later commented in his autobiography about his difficulties in selling to Campbell, appeared in the March 1972 issue with [...] "The Gold at the Starbow's End", which was nominated for both the Hugo and Nebula Awards, and that summer Joe Haldeman's [...] "Hero" [...] appeared. [...] This was the first story in Haldeman's [...] "Forever War" [...] sequence; Campbell had rejected it, listing multiple reasons including the frequent use of profanity and the implausibility of men and women serving in combat together. [...] Bova asked to <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> and ran it without asking for changes. [...] Other new writers included Spider Robinson, whose first sale was [...] "The Guy With the Eyes" [...] in the February 1973 issue; George R.R.

Abas refused to make any concessions and ambushed Ber's forces in a dawn assault. Several more skirmishes took place, wherein Ber was finally captured by Abas' men.

In 1920, Doyle debated the claims of Spiritualism with the notable sceptic Joseph McCabe at Queen's Hall in London. McCabe later published his evidence against the claims of Doyle and Spiritualism in a booklet entitled Is Spiritualism Based on Fraud? which claimed Doyle had been duped into believing Spiritualism by mediumship trickery.|$|E

Jodl nevertheless proved some of the charges made against him were untrue, such as the charge that he helped Hitler gain control of Germany in 1933. He was in one instance aided by a GI clerk who chose to give Luise a document showing that the execution of a group of British commandos in Norway had been legitimate.

Problems with David Magee's screenplay that initially could be shrugged off—occasionally slow pacing, melodramatic plot twists—became glaring. With familiarity, the fantasy simply wasn't as fanciful. It felt like growing up, and it was disappointing. On the other hand, many of the film's qualities are too strong to falter, starting with another fascinating man-child performance by Johnny Depp as Barrie." ...|$|R
