She is always changing her look and clothes to suit her current boyfriendâ€™s preference. But Amar, a poor, hardworking boy, sees beyond all her fake layers and likes Udita for her true self.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are various}} methods of calculating {{the length of}} an astrological age. In <b>sun-sign</b> astrology, the first sign is Aries, {{followed}} by Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces, whereupon the cycle returns to Aries and through the zodiacal signs again. Astrological ages, however, proceed {{in the opposite direction}} ("retrograde" [...] in astronomy). Therefore, the Age of Aquarius follows the Age of Pisces.|$|E

It {{is only a matter}} of convenience. I think about 65 per cent of such predictions come correct and that is a good average. But no, you cannot make predictions like that. You have to read the individual horoscopes and even then you must have it in your destiny to predict correctly." ...|$|E
5000|$|Leo, {{who took}} {{the name of his}} <b>sun-sign</b> as a pseudonym, is {{credited}} with starting the movement towards a more psychologically-oriented horoscope analysis in astrology, being the first astrologer to argue for a loose interpretation of possible trends of experience rather than the specific prediction of events. His influence has been described as marking a 'turning point' in horoscope delineation, because, as astrological historian James Holden explains: [...] Thereafter, what has been more recently called [...] "event-oriented" [...] astrology gradually receded in favor of character analysis and vague descriptions of possible areas of psychological harmony or stress.|$|E
5000|$|Santillana and von Dechend {{state that}} ancient myths have no {{historical}} basis but a cosmological {{one based on}} a primitive form of astrology. They {{recognized the importance of}} the heliacally rising constellation as markers for the astrological ages and claimed that knowledge of this phenomenon had been known for thousands of years previously. They claim that to understand ancient thinking it is necessary to understand astrology, not the modern <b>sun-sign</b> or horoscopic astrology, but the astrology of ancient times which was the lingua franca of ancient times. They go further and state that our knowledge of the dawn of astrology and its relationship to ancient myths and star names is limited to about 2100 BC during the Renaissance of Sumerian Culture instead of being able to examine the real old material on the subject. In [...] "Hamlet's Mill" [...] it is claimed that the ancient Greeks knew of three successive destructions that correlate to three ages and that since the beginning of history the vernal point has moved through Taurus, Aries, and Pisces. Hesiod in [...] "Works and Days" [...] refers to five successive ages.|$|E
