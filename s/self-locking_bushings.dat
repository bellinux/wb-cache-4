These plates allow many options in screw angulation enhancing the possibility of fracture fixation. This versatility allows for a stable osteosynthesis of highly comminuted or osteoporotic fractures. Several technologies exist to obtain variable axis locking such as <b>self-locking</b> <b>bushings</b> or screws with two components where a cap locks the screw in a chosen direction.|$|E
