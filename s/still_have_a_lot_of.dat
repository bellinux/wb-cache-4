No one is better than any one else. What an incredible day for California AND for equality." [...] Lovato later said: [...] "I believe in gay marriage, I believe in equality. I think there's a lot of hypocrisy with religion. But I just found {{that you can have}} your own relationship with God, and I <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> faith." ...|$|E
500|$|Discussing {{the season}} finale, Tancharoen stated, [...] "This season, we've {{explored}} {{a lot of}} different themes: There's the notion of purpose. We also introduced an Inhuman who has a strong sense of faith. We talk a lot about destiny and all these things intertwine." [...] Bennet likened {{the end of the season}} to [...] "the end of the first book of S.H.I.E.L.D. This finale feels like the end of something bigger and the beginning of a whole new tone for the show." [...] Whedon added, [...] "We wanted to put a close to [...] story. We knew going into this season what our plan was for both Ward and Hive. Our goal was to make it not just feel like victory—we like to get a victory and also a loss at the same time." [...] On whether the Inhumans storyline would also be ending with the season, Whedon said, [...] "We think of it as never closed. We like that we were able to open up that world and make Inhumans a permanent part of the universe. Now, we have a quick-fire way of introducing people with powers. It gives us a lot of leeway in our world, and it lets us explode the metaphors of what it is like to be different. We will never close that chapter." [...] On making a six-month time jump at the end of [...] "Ascension", Bell said that despite each character completing their arcs this season, [...] "we <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> plot. Emotionally, their arcs are done. What the jump lets you do is to do a reset ... It allows us to put down a lot of old plot and pick up a lot of new." [...] Whedon added, [...] "We’ve done it each season, so we just wanted to do it a little early ... we would’ve done [...] in episode 1 next year but what we wanted to do was tease" [...] things to come at the end of this season.|$|E
2500|$|The {{release of}} KDE 4.0 {{was met with}} a mixed reception. While early adopters were {{tolerant}} {{of the lack of}} finish for some of its new features, the release was widely criticized {{because of a lack of}} stability and its [...] "beta" [...] quality. Computerworld reporter Steven Vaughan-Nichols criticised KDE 4.0 and KDE 4.1 and called for a fork of KDE 3.5 by rebuilding it on top of Qt4. The same reporter later praised KDE 4.3 and welcomed the KDE 3.5 continuation project Trinity. Although Linus Torvalds switched from GNOME to KDE on December 2005, he switched back to GNOME after Fedora replaced KDE 3.5 with 4.0. In an interview with Computerworld, he described KDE 4.0 as a [...] "break everything" [...] model and [...] "half-baked" [...] release, claiming that he expected it to be an upgrade of KDE 3.5, when the reality was that there were significant cases of features being regressed due to its extensive changes. (Torvalds did point out, however, that he understood why the developers in charge of the KDE project had chosen to make such drastic changes to the desktop environment in KDE 4.0 and the reason for its premature release, and that his criticism was more on the way KDE 4.0 was pushed out to the public.) Despite the criticism, reviewers such as Ars Technica’s Ryan Paul noted that the visual style [...] "is very attractive and easy on the eyes" [...] and [...] "exhibits a relatively high level of polish" [...] and that [...] "the underlying technologies <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> very serious potential".|$|E

All I can say is that it’s hard to say, in light of all the information in the media, all the information coming out of various accountability offices in the United States, that they weren’t aware. But I think we’re left with basically a binary alternative here. Either they were aware and they deliberately misled Canadians or they weren’t aware and we have a negligence and competence issue with this government." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} their {{contribution}} to industry and economy, the contemporary semi-peripheral states are semi-industrialized.
