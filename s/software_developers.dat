Analyze the <b>software</b> <b>developer</b> to have the expert knowledge and develop the <b>software.</b> <b>Developer</b> must have the knowledge to define the problem, analysis, design and implementation. The every process must well defined by the developer. The developer entirely depends on the system and they have the expert solution of the system. The developer has communication every services using the SOA architecture. For the services and the expert knowledge to gain the <b>developer,</b> create the <b>software</b> <b>developer</b> optimizer. This optimizer will develop based on the knowledge base of the developer. This paper introduces the knowledge management process for an expert system that is the <b>software</b> <b>developer</b> optimizer (SDO). It is the design of expert system for the <b>software</b> <b>developer</b> process. Then the development stages are described. The SDO is an innovation since it is the first expert system developed for <b>software</b> <b>developer</b> It is a knowledge-based and SOA optimization system...|$|R

5|$|Professional <b>software</b> <b>developers</b> are {{responsible}} for most of Folding@home's code, both for the client and server-side. The development team includes programmers from Nvidia, ATI, Sony, and Cauldron Development. Clients can be downloaded only from the official Folding@home website or its commercial partners, and will only interact with Folding@home computer files. They will upload and download data with Stanford's Folding@home data servers (over port8080, with 80 as an alternate), and the communication is verified using 2048-bit digital signatures. While the client's graphical user interface (GUI) is open-source, the client is proprietary software citing security and scientific integrity as the reasons.|$|E
5|$|Unstable, always codenamed sid, is the trunk. Packages are {{accepted}} without checking the distribution as a whole. This branch is usually run by <b>software</b> <b>developers</b> {{who participate in}} a project and need the latest libraries available, and by those who prefer bleeding-edge software. Debian does not provide full Sid installation discs, but rather a minimal ISO {{that can be used}} to install over a network connection. Additionally, this branch can be installed through a system upgrade from stable or testing.|$|E
5|$|A Passenger Information Display System (PIDS) was {{installed}} in all Metrorail stations in 2000. Displays are located on all track platforms and at the mezzanine entrances of stations, and provide real-time information on next train arrivals, delayed trains, emergency announcements, and related information. WMATA also provides current train and related information to customers with conventional web browsers, as well as users of smartphones and other mobile devices. In 2010 Metro began sharing its PIDS data with outside <b>software</b> <b>developers,</b> for use in creating additional real-time applications for mobile devices. Free apps are {{available to the public}} on major mobile device software platforms (iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Palm). WMATA also began providing real-time train information by phone in 2010.|$|E

5|$|Damage to a German steel {{facility}} {{occurred during}} a DST transition in 1993, when a computer timing system {{linked to a}} radio time synchronization signal allowed molten steel to cool for one hour less than the required duration, resulting in spattering of molten steel when it was poured. Medical devices may generate adverse events that could harm patients, without being obvious to clinicians responsible for care. These problems are compounded when the DST rules themselves change; <b>software</b> <b>developers</b> must test and perhaps modify many programs, and users must install updates and restart applications. Consumers must update devices such as programmable thermostats with the correct DST rules or manually adjust the devices' clocks. A common strategy to resolve these problems in computer systems is to express time using the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) rather than the local time zone. For example, Unix-based computer systems use the UTC-based Unix time internally.|$|E
5|$|Rage <b>Software,</b> <b>developers</b> of Incoming, {{were known}} for their {{cutting-edge}} graphics and effects. Incoming was no exception. The game utilized the 3dfx technology, and was included in some retail versions of the Voodoo2 graphics card. Critics were praising the game's visuals on its 1998 PC release. In particular, the explosions, similar special effects and cut scenes using the main game engine were noted for their quality. The Dolby Surround-encoded sound was a further source of acclaim. The reception, however, was less positive when the game was ported to the Dreamcast. A release title for Sega's console, critics complained that the graphics were not top-of-the-range {{at the time of}} its late 1999 release, with the draw distance being cited as a specific hindrance on gameplay. An arcade version followed in 2003, running on the Vortek V3 Global VR arcade board, utilising the system's unique virtual reality hardware interface.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{releases}} of System 6 were unstable; many third party <b>software</b> <b>developers</b> {{did not receive}} copies before its release, resulting in widespread compatibility problems. At first, many common software programs such as Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Works and 4th Dimension were not fully compatible with System 6. There were also software bugs in the Color Manager, Script Manager, and Sound Manager extension files. Apple announced that 66 bugs were fixed when the 6.0.1 update was released in September 1988. However, a major bug involving text spacing of screen fonts was found in 6.0.1 after distribution began. This led to the quick release of 6.0.2, which solved this problem. Some customers waited longer until moving to System 6 because of the poor reputation already gained.|$|E
