5|$|A {{large number}} of {{decompression}} experiments were done using goats, which were compressed for three hours to assumed saturation, rapidly decompressed to surface pressure, and examined for symptoms of decompression sickness. Goats which had been compressed to 2.25 bar absolute or less <b>showed</b> <b>no</b> signs of DCS after rapid decompression to the surface. Goats compressed to 6 bar and rapidly decompressed to 2.6 bar (pressure ratio 2.3 to 1) also <b>showed</b> <b>no</b> signs of DCS. Haldane and his co-workers concluded that a decompression from saturation with a pressure ratio of 2 to 1 was unlikely to produce symptoms.|$|E
5|$|A test in 1997 {{showed that}} P. fimbriata′s {{preferences}} for {{different types of}} prey are in the order: web spiders; jumping spiders; and insects. These preferences apply to both live prey and motionless lures, and to P. fimbriata specimens without prey for 7days ("well-fed") and without prey for 14days ("starved"). P. fimbriata specimens without prey for 21days ("extra-starved") <b>showed</b> <b>no</b> preference for different types of prey. The test included as prey several species of web spiders and jumping spiders, and {{the selection of the}} prey species <b>showed</b> <b>no</b> evidence of affecting the results. Insects were represented by the house fly Musca domestica.|$|E
5|$|A test in 1997 {{showed that}} P. labiata from the Philippines and from Sri Lanka have similar {{preferences}} for {{different types of}} prey, and that the order of preference is: web spiders; jumping spiders; and insects.

P. labiata specimens without prey for 21days ("extra-starved") <b>showed</b> <b>no</b> preference for different types of prey.

50|$|A flatline is an {{electrical}} time sequence measurement that <b>shows</b> <b>no</b> activity and therefore, when represented, shows a flat line {{instead of a}} moving one. It almost always refers to either a flatlined electrocardiogram, where the heart <b>shows</b> <b>no</b> electrical activity (asystole), or to a flat electroencephalogram, in which the brain <b>shows</b> <b>no</b> electrical activity (brain death). Both of these specific cases are involved in various definitions of death.|$|R

50|$|In {{line with}} this prediction, many studies of seabirds have {{revealed}} no EPCs or EPFs. Several genetic studies of storm-petrels, <b>show</b> <b>no</b> evidence of EPCs or EPFs, {{which is not}} surprising considering these are burrow-nesting seabirds that lay only one egg per year and show high biparental investment. Dovekie (Alle alle), a surface nesting alcid that raises one chick per year, has <b>shown</b> <b>no</b> EPFs or EPP. Nazca boobies (Sula granti) have been well studied at breeding colonies in the Galapagos for decades and also <b>show</b> <b>no</b> evidence of EPCs or EPFs; also not a surprising result since they only have one surviving offspring per year. Chinstrap penguins, which raise two chicks annually, have also <b>shown</b> <b>no</b> EPCs or EPFs.|$|R
