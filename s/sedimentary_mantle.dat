40|$|The paper {{considers}} geological {{conditions for}} <b>sedimentary</b> <b>mantle</b> formation. In the geological past limestone deposits and sedimentation rock mass from fragmentary materials brought by water flows were {{formed in the}} southern part of the stretched geosyncline which had been submerged by shallow sea. By lapse of time deposits were transferred into sandstone, siltstone and mudstone that represented the bottom part of rock mass. Continental conditions were established as a result of orogenic process which took place nearly 30 – 50 million years ago. Erosional activity of wind and flowing waters was observed on the surface for a long period of time. The top part of soil rock mass is represented by alluvial deposits of the rivers Tigris and Euphrates. During the process of sediment deposition more full-flowing Tigris caused more complicated dynamics of water channels  including meandering and changeability of inter-bedding. Engineering and geological investigations have been carried out with the purpose to study structure of soil rock mass in various regions of the country (Al-Diwaniya, Khidr, Al-Nasiriya and Khila). Specific drill columns have been selected on the basis of analysis of soil rock masses.   Theses drill columns may serve for further selection of rational types of foundations (shallow foundation, piles foundation) or creation of artificial foundations (cementing, armoring etc.).  </p...|$|E

The C isotopic composition of CO 2 (d 13 C–CO 2 2. 0 ‰to 3. 8 ‰) and He isotope ratios (R/RA 0. 12 – 0. 27) were used to calculate the fraction of CO 2 originating from <b>mantle</b> degassing vs. <b>sedimentary</b> sources. The results show that CO 2 predominantly (average of 75 %) derives from the thermo-metamorphic reaction of limestone. Between 6 % and 22 % of the CO 2 in the samples derives from organic-rich <b>sedimentary</b> sources. The <b>mantle</b> source accounts for 0 – 6 % of the total CO 2; however, in two samples, located in proximity to the most important faults of the plain, the mantle accounts for 24 % and 42 %. The presence of faults and fractures allows upward gas migration from a deep source to the Earth’s surface, not only in the peri-Tyrrhenian sector, as generally reported by studies on natural gas emissions in central Italy, but also in the pre-Apennine and Apennine belts. Isotope ratios of CH 4 (d 13 C–CH 4 6. 1 ‰ to 22. 7 ‰; dD–CH 4 9 ‰ to 129 ‰) show that CH 4 {{does not appear to be}} related to mantle or magma degassing, but it is the product of thermal degradation of organic matter (i. e. thermogenic origin) and/or the reduction of CO 2 (i. e. geothermal origin).

40|$|Boninites are unusual high MgO-high SiO 2 {{volcanic}} rocks {{found in}} several western Pacific island arcs. Their high Mg/(Mg + total Fe) (0. 55 - 0. 83) and compatible element contents (Ni = 70 - 450 ppm, Cr = 200 - 1800 ppm) indicate equilibration with mantle peridotite, but their low TiO 2 contents (0. 1 - 0. 5 %) indicate severe depletion of this source. K, Rb, Sr and Ba abundances in boninites {{are typical of}} primitive arc basalts, but ratios such as Ti/Zr and La/Yb are variable (Ti/Zr = 23 - 67, (La/Yb) e. f. = 0. 6 - 4. 7). Evidence for both enrichment and depletion of incompatible elements suggests that boninites are derived from refractory peridotite which has been metasomatically enriched in LREE, Zr, Sr, Ba and alkalis. Wide variations in 143 Nd/ 144 Nd (0. 51262 - 0. 51296) are correlated with La/Sm, Sm/Nd and Ti/Zr, which enables identification of components in the boninite source. Possible LREE depleted components have relative REE and Ti abundances like those in depleted peridotites and high 143 Nd/ 144 Nd ratios which reach MORB-like values. Possible LREE enriched components have relative REE abundances {{similar to those in}} metasomatized mantle peridotite nodules, and low 143 Nd/ 144 Nd ratios which indicate either <b>sedimentary</b> sources or <b>mantle</b> sources with recent to ancient LREE enrichment. Relative abundances of Ba and Sr in boninites decrease with increasing LREE enrichment and suggest a non-sedimentary source for the LREE enriched material. Enrichment in Ba, Sr and alkalis may result from a third component derived from subducted oceanic crust. Two models can account for the successive generation of boninites and arc tholeiites within a single area: 1) boninites can be derived from the peridotite residue of earlier arc tholeiite generation which is metasomatically enriched in LREE before boninite volcanism, or 2) arc tholeiites and boninites can be derived from a variably depleted peridotite source which has been pervasively enriched in LREE. Areas of fertile peridotite would yield tholeiites while refractory areas would yield boninites...|$|R
40|$|This {{historical}} perspective provides an overall {{view of the}} main steps {{that led to the}} acceptance of the concept of mantle exhumation accompanying lithosphere stretching and extreme crustal thinning. We first remember that the presence of exposures of mantle rocks along oceanic spreading ridges was early reported in the 60 's due to the results of sediment cores and dredge hauls collected along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. In the meantime, detailed analysis of the relationships between oceanic sediments of Late Jurassic age and their primary basement in the Apennine ophiolites led many authors to point to the importance of exhumation of mantle rocks on ancient seafloors. By contrast to the thick sections of classical ophiolites (e. g. Oman), the Alpine-Corsican-Appennine ophiolites are characterized by a relatively small amount of mafic rocks (gabbros and basalts), by the absence of any sheeted dyke complex and by the frequent occurrence of oceanic sediments stratigraphically overlying mantle-derived peridotites and associated gabbroic intrusions. They display some of the characteristics of slow-spreading ridge systems, but, due to their highly tectonized character, they have been interpreted successively either as remnants of oceanic fracture zones of normal ocean or as remnants of very-poorly organized, abnormal oceanic basement. This review shows how the concept of mantle exhumation has been elaborated more or less in the same period both by marine geoscientists and by geologists conducting investigations in ophiolitic units of the Alps-Apennines mountain belt. Dredging and diving results from the Gorringe Bank, the Iberia margin, the Thyrrenian Sea and the Central Atlantic in the 1980 's and 1990 's provided additional proofs that the mantle is currently exhumed in various oceanic environments, including distal continental margins, back-arc basins and slow-spreading ridges of wide oceans. It is shown finally how renewed cross-information from mountain belts and the oceans, multiplying the examples of <b>sedimentary</b> reworking of <b>mantle</b> material, help better constrain the mechanisms of mantle exhumation. This mechanism progressively appeared as a fundamental step during the processes of extension of both continental and oceanic lithospheres in numerous geological situations worldwide...|$|R

To {{get the full}} text please contact the other at maliknasr 40 @hotmail. com, mmalik@aaaid. orgThe Study area {{is located in the}} Blue Nile State, about 30 km west to Edamazin town, 570 km south Khartoum. The total area is about 220, 000 feddans (9247 ha). The area is divided into 220 blocks each block is (2 x 2 km) about 1000 feddans, The annual mean temperature is 27. 7 oC; the average annual rainfall ranges from 400 mm. to 700 mm, the rainy season extends from May to October with maximum rainfall in August, the distribution and intensity are erratic. The annual potential evapotranspiration is 1894 mm and generally decreases when rainfall increases, resulting in an annual water deficit of about 1543 mm. The mean annual sunshine percentage is 75 %; the wind is moderate all over the year with an average monthly value of 2. 4 meter / second. The prevailing wind blows from the north-east direction in dry season and from south-west direction in the rainy season. The soil of the project area has an Isohyperthermic soil temperature regime, and has an ustic moisture regime because the survey area is located in the semi-arid climatic zones. The main geological formations underlying the survey consist mainly of basement complex that includes igneous and <b>sedimentary</b> rocks. The <b>mantle</b> that cover the underlying rocks are of recent thick deposits mainly fine textured forming the clay plain these sediments have been weathered in the Ethiopian high lands under humid conditions transported by the Blue Nile. The general topography of the area is flat to nearly flat plain with some depressions of variable extent, the largest depressions running along the general slope of the project area. The study area lies within the acacia tall grass Savannah. the natural vegetation consists mainly acacia trees, shrubs and grasses. The people in the project area are involved in several activities such as, the traditional and mechanized rain fed agriculture of sorghum, millet on clayey soils. Some are nomads, {{and most of them are}} labors in Agadi project.. The main water source in the area is the rain water reservoirs (hafirs) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{discovery}} of exhumed continental mantle and hyper-extended crust in present-day magma-poor rifted margins {{is at the}} origin of a paradigm shift within the research field of deep-water rifted margins. It opened new questions about the strain history of rifted margins and the nature and composition of <b>sedimentary,</b> crustal and <b>mantle</b> rocks in rifted margins. Thanks {{to the benefit of}} more than one century of work in the Alps and access to world-class outcrops preserving the primary relationships between sediments and crustal and mantle rocks from the fossil Alpine Tethys margins, it is possible to link the subsidence history and syn-rift sedimentary evolution with the strain distribution observed in the crust and mantle rocks exposed in the distal rifted margins. In this paper, we will focus on the transition from early to late rifting that is associated with considerable crustal thinning and a reorganization of the rift system. Crustal thinning is at the origin of a major change in the style of deformation from high-angle to low-angle normal faulting which controls basin-architecture, sedimentary sources and processes and the nature of basement rocks exhumed along the detachment faults in the distal margin. Stratigraphic and isotopic ages indicate that this major change occurred in late Sinemurian time, involving a shift of the syn-rift sedimentation toward the distal domain associated with a major reorganization of the crustal structure with exhumation of lower and middle crust. These changes may be triggered by mantle processes, as indicated by the infiltration of MOR-type magmas in the lithospheric mantle, and the uplift of the Brianconnais domain. Thinning and exhumation of the crust and lithosphere also resulted in the creation of new paleogeographic domains, the Proto Valais and Liguria-Piemonte domains. These basins show a complex, 3 D temporal and spatial evolution that might have evolved, at least {{in the case of the}} Liguria-Piemonte basin, in the formation of an embryonic oceanic crust. The re-interpretation of the rift evolution and the architecture of the distal rifted margins in the Alps have important implications for the understanding of rifted margins worldwide, but also for the paleogeographic reconstruction of the Alpine domain and its subsequent Alpine compressional overprint...|$|R
40|$|The Principal Cordillera of Central Chile is {{characterized}} by two belts of different ages and lithologies: (i) an eastern Mesozoic belt, consisting of limestone- and gypsum-rich sedimentary rocks at the border between Central Chile and Argentina, where the active volcanic arc occurs; and (ii) a western belt of Cenozoic age containing basaltic to andesitic volcanic and volcanoclastic sequences. This distinctive geological setting controls water chemistry of cold and thermal springs in the region, which are fed by meteoric water that circulates through deep regional structures. In the western sector of Principal Cordillera, water–rock interaction processes produce lowTDS, slightly alkaline HCO 3 − dominatedwaters, although dissolution of underlyingMesozoic evaporitic rocks occasionally causes SO 4 2 − and Cl− enrichments. In this area, few Na+–HCO 3 − and Na+–SO 4 2 − waters occurred, being likely produced by a Ca 2 +–Na+ exchange during water–rock interactions. Differently, the chemical features of Ca 2 +–Cl−waterswas likely related to an albitization–chloritization process affecting basaltic to andesitic rocks outcropping in this area. Addition of Na+–Cl− brines uprising from the eastern sector through the westverging thrust faults cannot be excluded, {{as suggested by the}} occurrence of mantle He (~ 19 %) in dissolved gases. In contrast, in the eastern sector of the study region, mainly characterized by the occurrence of evaporitic sequences and relatively high heat flow,mature Na+–Cl− waters were recognized, the latter being likely related to promising geothermal reservoirs, as supported by the chemical composition of the associated bubbling and fumarolic gases. Their relatively low 3 He/ 4 He ratios (up to 3. 9 Ra) measured in the fumaroles on this area evidenced a significant crustal contamination by radiogenic 4 He. The latter was likely due to (i) degassing from 4 He-rich magma batches residing in the crust, and/or (ii) addition of fluids interacting with sedimentary rocks. This interpretation is consistent with the measured δ 13 C-CO 2 values (from− 13. 2 to− 5. 72 ‰vs. V-PDB) and the CO 2 / 3 He ratios (up to 14. 6 × 1010), which suggest that CO 2 mostly originates from the limestone-rich basement and recycling of subducted sediments,with an important addition of <b>sedimentary</b> (organic-derived) carbon,whereas <b>mantle</b> degassing contributes at a minor extent. According to geothermometric estimations based on the Na+, K+, Mg 2 + and Ca 2 + contents, the mature Na+–Cl− rich waters approached a chemical equilibrium with calcite, dolomite, anhydrite, fluorite, albite, K-feldspar and Ca- andMg-saponites at a broad range of temperatures (up to ~ 300 °C) In the associated gas phase, equilibria of chemical reactions characterized by slowkinetics (e. g. sabatier reaction) suggested significant contributions from hot and oxidizing magmatic gases. This hypothesis is consistent with the δ 13 C-CO 2, Rc/Ra, CO 2 / 3 He values of the fumarolic gases. Accordingly, the isotopic signatures of the fumarolic steam {{is similar to that of}} fluids discharged from the summit craters of the two active volcanoes in the study area (Tupungatito and Planchón–Peteroa). These results encourage the development of further geochemical and geophysical surveys aimed to provide an exhaustive evaluation of the geothermal potential of these volcanic–hydrothermal systems...|$|R
