5|$|Some {{table salt}} sold for {{consumption}} contain additives which address {{a variety of}} health concerns, especially in the developing world. The identities and amounts of additives vary widely from country to country. Iodine is an important micronutrient for humans, and a deficiency of the element can cause lowered production of thyroxine (hypothyroidism) and enlargement of the thyroid gland (endemic goitre) in adults or cretinism in children. Iodized salt {{has been used to}} correct these conditions since 1924 and consists of table salt mixed with a minute amount of potassium iodide, <b>sodium</b> <b>iodide</b> or sodium iodate. A small amount of dextrose may also be added to stabilize the iodine. Iodine deficiency affects about two billion people around the world and is the leading preventable cause of mental retardation. Iodized table salt has significantly reduced disorders of iodine deficiency in countries where it is used.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{detectors}} include <b>sodium</b> <b>iodide</b> (NaI) scintillation counters and high-purity germanium detectors.|$|E
25|$|Scintillation {{detectors}} use crystals that emit {{light when}} gamma rays {{interact with the}} atoms in the crystals. The intensity of the light produced is usually proportional to the energy deposited in the crystal by the gamma ray; a well known situation where this relationship fails is the absorption of <200keV radiation by intrinsic and doped <b>sodium</b> <b>iodide</b> detectors. The mechanism {{is similar to that}} of a thermoluminescent dosimeter. The detectors are joined to photomultipliers; a photocathode converts the light into electrons; and then by using dynodes to generate electron cascades through delta ray production, the signal is amplified. Common scintillators include thallium-doped <b>sodium</b> <b>iodide</b> (NaI(Tl))—often simplified to <b>sodium</b> <b>iodide</b> (NaI) detectors—and bismuth germanate (BGO). Because photomultipliers are also sensitive to ambient light, scintillators are encased in light-tight coverings.|$|E

Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 95 single canal human teeth were collected. Then after washing and cleaning and filing, the sterilization done using an autoclave. The teeth were smeared with enterococcus faecalis except five which selected as controls and then divided them into 3 groups which A randomly represented the irrigation by <b>sodium</b> hypochlorite, <b>iodide</b> potassium iodide (IKI) and chlorhexidine solution were done. The teeth were filled with gutta-percha and then incubated in a incubator for 90 days at a temperature of 37 ° C. The specimens were analyzed for Colony Count.

The specimens which were washed by IKI had the most positive amount of cultures (23. 3 %) and the specimens which washed by chlorhexidine had the lowest (16. 7 %).

40|$|It is {{important}} to be able to determine the actual supply of vitamins and minerals in the population, a procedure that can be carried out by using parameters applied to blood or urine. This is also called nutritional status assessment. At the moment, the intake of vitamins and minerals is determined in the Dutch National Food Consumption Surveys. In these food consumption surveys, dietary monitoring is done via 24 -h dietary recalls. Signals of possible inadequate intake (vitamin B 2, folate, vitamin B 12, vitamin D, magnesium, iron, zinc) and the potential risk of an excessive intake (vitamin D, sodium, zinc) from the surveys can be evaluated through a nutritional status assessment. Information gained through such an assessment can also compensate for the lack of knowledge in the Netherlands about the nutrient supply of <b>iodide,</b> <b>sodium</b> and selenium. And finally, status assessment is recommended as being more practical than dietary monitoring for immigrant groups. Parameters for the vitamins B 2, folate, B 12 and D, and the minerals magnesium, <b>sodium,</b> iron, <b>iodide,</b> selenium and zinc are also discussed in the report.

40|$|Iodide (I-) is an {{essential}} constituent of the thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T 3) and thyroxine (T 4), and the iodide concentrating mechanism of the thyroid gland {{is essential for the}} synthesis of these hormones. In addition, differential uptake of iodine isotopes (radioiodine) is a key modality for the diagnosis and therapy of thyroid cancer. The <b>sodium</b> dependent <b>iodide</b> transport activity of the thyroid gland is mainly attributed to the functional expression of the Na+/I- Symporter (NIS) localized at the basolateral membrane of thyrocytes. In this paper, we review and summarize current data on molecular characterization, on structure and function of NIS protein, {{as well as on the}} transcriptional regulation of NIS encoding gene in the thyroid gland. We also propose that a better and more precise understanding of NIS gene regulation at the molecular level in both healthy and malignant thyroid cells may lead to the identification of small molecule candidates. These could then be translated into clinical practice for better induction and more effective modulation of radioiodine uptake in dedifferentiated thyroid cancer cells and in their distant metastatic lesions...|$|R

25|$|Scintillation {{counters}} {{consist of}} a scintillating crystal (typically of <b>sodium</b> <b>iodide</b> doped with thallium) attached to a photomultiplier.

Scintillation counters are often connected in series with a gas flow proportional counter: the latter is provided with an outlet window opposite the inlet, to which the scintillation counter is attached.

40|$|In the {{presence}} of hydrogen peroxide and either potassium <b>iodide,</b> <b>sodium</b> chloride, or potassium bromide, purified human myeloperoxidase was rapidly lethal to several species of Candida. Its candidacidal activity was inhibited by cyanide, fluoride, and azide, and by heat inactivation of the enzyme. A hydrogen peroxidegenerating system consisting of d-amino acid oxidase, flavine-adenine dinucleotide, and d-alanine could replace hydrogen peroxide in the candidacidal system. Horseradish peroxidase and human eosinophil granules also exerted candidacidal activity in {{the presence}} of iodide and hydrogen peroxide; however, unlike myeloperoxidase or neutrophil granules, these peroxidase sources were inactive when chloride replaced iodide. Cells of Saccharomyces, Geotrichum, and Rhodotorula species, and spores of Aspergillus fumigatus and A. niger were also killed by the combination of myeloperoxidase, iodide, and hydrogen peroxide.
