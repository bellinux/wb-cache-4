50|$|Fort Greene {{consisted}} of three separate reservations in Point Judith. The East Reservation is now the Fort Greene Army Reserve Center and has the 16-inch Battery Hamilton, but is not normally accessible to the public. The West Reservation is the campground of Fishermen's Memorial State Park, and includes the 16-inch Battery 109 and a Plotting, Switchboard, and Radio (PSR) bunker housing a plotting room {{as part of the}} Coast Artillery fire control system. It also has a fire control tower resembling a barn <b>silo.</b> <b>Battery</b> 109 is overgrown, although a path {{to the top of the}} bunker is maintained. The South Reservation is near Point Judith Light and is the seaside portion of the park. The actual Fishermen's Memorial is on one of the gun positions of Battery 211, and a path leads to the top of the bunker. A Panama mount is in front of the bunker. However, no interpretation of the park's military history is provided.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} experimentally registered temperatures {{occurring in}} RC grouped silo bins for grain, corresponding to winter operation period in Polish climate conditions. A new generation wireless computerized measurement system was applied, {{based on the}} use of telemetric transceivers operating in intelligent radio network. On the basis of experimental temperature distribution, numerical analysis of the hoop thermal stresses and bending moments in reinforced concrete <b>silo</b> <b>battery</b> subjected to grain pressure and thermal gradient was carried out. In the analysis the numerical model of silo wall with interaction between wall structure and stored particulate solid was applied which had previously been developed and validated on a stand-alone ferroconcrete silo bin model...|$|E
50|$|The {{island has}} defunct Nike Ajax missile <b>silos,</b> <b>battery</b> NY-15 {{that were part}} of the United States Army base Fort Slocum from 1956-1961 and {{operated}} by the army's 66th Antiaircraft Artillery Missile Battalion. Some silos are located on Davids' Island. The Integrated Fire Control system that tracked the targets and directed missiles was located in Fort Slocum. The last components of the missile system were closed in 1974.|$|R
