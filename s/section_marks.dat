In the case of [...] "Ticket to Ride", the section consists of a repeated refrain similar to {{the last line of}} the chorus ("My baby don't care"), played over a constant A major chord and set to the double-time rhythm used in the bridge. Lennon said this closing section was one of his [...] "favourite bits" [...] in the song. He also claimed that [...] "Ticket to Ride" [...] was the first heavy metal record ever made. According to MacDonald, the track's heavy sound may have been influenced by Lennon and George Harrison's first encounter with LSD, the precise date for which varies among Beatles biographers.|$|E
50|$|Shortly {{after the}} lock, the canal is crossed by Tankard's Stone Bridge, {{and then by}} Paper House Bridge. This is a late-eighteenth century single arched {{humpback}} bridge, made of millstone grit, and is grade II listed. The East Coast Main Line crosses next, after which comes Burton Hall Bridge, an accommodation bridge designed by William Jessop, and constructed when the canal was built. The A19 road crosses at Burn Bridge, and a dismantled railway used to cross just {{to the south of}} the A63 road bridge. Immediately afterwards, another original bridge carries Brayton Lane across the canal. Then the Doncaster to Selby railway line crosses at Brayton Railway Bridge, and the A1041 road at Bawtry Road Bridge. The only swing bridge is situated just before the final lock, and is operated by boaters.

5000|$|Scott Warfield {{wrote that}} [...] "the symphony in D minor follows the same formal plans that Strauss had been {{studying}} for nearly five years. The outer movements are real sonata-allegro movements, now complete with true development sections. The slow movement draws on the same model and the Scherzo follows the standard binary form." [...] The first movement opens with a fifty bar slow introduction, laying out thematic material used later. As Werbeck notes, within this introduction, Strauss goes {{through a series of}} modulations in which one two-bar theme is repeated in a sequence from D min, Bflat7, Eflat, B7, Emin, C, Fmin, Dflat, ending in F. This wondering tonality is in contrast to the otherwise conservative musical conception of the symphony, and perhaps prefigures the future Strauss. The exposition starts with a shift to 3/4, and the transition uses thematic material both from the first theme and the introduction. [...] "This opening movement also contains the first genuine development section in any symphonic work by Strauss. His technique for development in this lengthy subsection (188 bars) consists primarily repeating the material...as it sequences through various harmonic levels. This <b>section</b> <b>marks</b> the first time that Strauss went beyond the safety of a codified formal plan". By the age of sixteen, Strauss was writing a symphony which [...] "need not be excused as a [...] "student" [...] work". As David Hurwitz notes, Strauss had a rare mastery of orchestration and in particular writing for woodwind: [...] "Colorful scoring that captivates the ear and never fatigues or bores the listener makes a work sound shorter than it really is, even one that has a rather stiff little fugue in the middle of its finale, as does the First Symphony." ...|$|E

40|$|Calcareous {{nannoplankton}} assemblages and benthic d 18 O isotopes of Pliocene {{deep-sea sediments}} of ODP site 1172 (East of Tasmania) {{have been studied}} to improve {{our knowledge of the}} Southern Ocean paleoceanography. Our study site is located just north of the Subtropical Front (STF), an ideal setting to monitor migrations of the STF during our study period, between 3. 45 and 2. 45 Ma. The assemblage identified at ODP site 1172 has been interpreted as characteristic for the transitional zone water mass, located south of the STF, based on: (i) the low abundances (< 1 %) of subtropical taxa, (ii) relatively high percentages of Coccolithus pelagicus, a subpolar type species, (iii) abundances from 2 - 10 % of Calcidiscus leptoporus, a species that frequently inhabits the zone south of the STF and (iv) the high abundances of small Noelaerhabdaceae which at present dominates the zone south of the STF. Across our interval the calcareous nannoplankton manifests glacial-interglacial variability. We have identified cold events, characterized by high abundances of C. pelagicus which coincide with glacial periods, except during G 7. After 3. 1 Ma cold events are more frequent, in concordance with global cooling trends. Around 2. 75 Ma, the interglacial stage G 7 is characterized by anomalous low temperatures which most likely are linked to definite closure of the Central American Seaway (CAS), an event that is believed to have had global consequences. A gradual increase of very small Reticulofenestra across our <b>section</b> <b>marks</b> a significant trend in the small Noelaerhabdaceae species group and has been linked to a general enhanced mixing of the water column in agreement with previous studies. It is suggested that a rapid decline of small Gephyrocapsa after isotopic stage G 7 might be related to the cooling observed in our study site after the closure of the CAS...|$|E
