5|$|Bulk cargo {{can be very}} dense, corrosive, or abrasive. This {{can present}} safety problems: cargo shifting, {{spontaneous}} combustion, and cargo saturation can threaten a ship. The use of ships that are old and have corrosion problems {{has been linked to}} a spate of bulker sinkings in the 1990s, as have the bulker's large hatchways, important for efficient cargo handling. New international regulations have since been introduced to improve ship design and inspection, and to <b>streamline</b> <b>the</b> process of abandoning ship.|$|E

5|$|The Mongols sought {{alliances with}} other nations and {{societies}} to ensure the flow of trade through the empire.

The Mongol military was mostly made up of cavalrymen. This allowed the military to move swiftly and easily over large distances.|$|E

5|$|To expand {{upon the}} concept of Reserve {{component}} and National Guard components, the First Army activated Division East and Division West, two commands responsible for reserve units' readiness and mobilization exercises. Division East activated at Fort Riley. This transformation {{was part of an}} overall restructuring of the US Army to <b>streamline</b> <b>the</b> organizations overseeing training. Division East took control of reserve units in states east of the Mississippi River, eliminating the need for the 24th Infantry Division headquarters. As such, the 24th Infantry Division was again inactivated on 1 August 2006 at Fort Riley.|$|E
5|$|RPGs {{can suffer}} {{in the area}} of exploration. Traditional RPGs {{encourage}} exploration of every detail of the game world, and provide for a more organic experience in which NPCs are distributed according to the internal logic of the game world or plot. Action games reward players for quick movement from location to location, and tend to ensure that no obstacles occur along the way. Games such as Mass Effect <b>streamline</b> <b>the</b> player's movements across the game world by indicating which NPCs can be interacted with, and by making it easier for players to find locations and shopkeepers who can exchange items for money or goods. Some of the best characteristics of RPGs can be lost when these road blocks are eliminated in the name of streamlining the player's experience.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese {{civilian}} administration encouraged Japanese {{businessmen and}} settlers to the expand phosphate mining and copra production, which came into commercial existence during the German colonial era. During this time, new infrastructure was built between towns—including road and harbour facilities, and electricity and sewerage lines were laid out. Immigration from Japan, Okinawa and Korea to Palau intensified {{as a result}} of new job opportunities. A state-owned enterprise, Nanyo Kohatsu Kabushiki Kaisha (South Seas Colonization Corporation) was formed in 1936 to <b>streamline</b> <b>the</b> islands' economic activities with the administration objective of developing the islands' self-sufficiency capabilities. In the late 1930s, Japanese pearl divers made regular visits to the Arafura Sea, and stopped by Palau from October to April. The influx of pearl divers from Japan {{led to the development of}} the island's tourist industry, and some Japanese settlers from Saipan opened new cafés, geisha houses and liquor houses in Koror to cater to the pearl divers during their stopovers in between October to April.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{plan was}} to create setpiece {{graphics}} for key story moments, similar to simulation titles on PC games. Among the scenes initially planned were Marth kneeling next to the character Jagen {{in a pool of}} blood, and two characters escaping from an ambush. To try and accommodate the advanced graphics, the team opted to use an MMC3 memory chip. The adoption of the MMC3 was influenced by memory space difficulties experienced by the team during the development of Famicom Wars. When it was discovered that the chip only had one megabite of memory, the team were forced to <b>streamline</b> <b>the</b> graphics and visuals, resulting in the setpiece graphics being cut. The reduced emphasis on graphics meant that the game was not visually impressive, which was later regretted by Kaga and other team members.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, several {{changes were}} made to the {{business}} routes in downtown Jackson. Eastbound BL I-94 traffic was shifted off Michigan Avenue along Blackstone Street to Washington Avenue, and from there it ran along Washington to Francis Street and back to Michigan Avenue. The westbound traffic was shifted north at Mechanic Street to Pearl Street, continuing until turning south at Blackstone back to Michigan Avenue. The eastern end was updated further in 1968 to use Louis Glick Highway to connect to the northern half of the loop around downtown to Michigan Avenue. A set of connector streets on the western side of the downtown loop opened in November 1969 to <b>streamline</b> <b>the</b> flow of traffic further resulting in the last changes to the BL I-94 routing in Jackson. Eastbound traffic was redirected to the connector on Michigan Avenue just east of Third Street. This connector curved south then east to Washington Avenue near First Street. Louis Glick Highway was extended west from Blackstone curving south to merge into Michigan. In 2012, the eastern terminus of the business route was shifted easterly to follow Ann Arbor and Sargent roads to exit145 on I-94; as a result, the former partial interchange between I-94 and Ann Arbor Road which formerly served as the business route's eastern terminus was obliterated.|$|E

In 1964, several changes {{were made to the}} business routes in downtown Jackson. Southbound Bus. US127 traffic was shifted off Michigan Avenue along Blackstone Street to Washington Avenue, and from there it ran along Washington to Francis Street and back to Michigan Avenue. The northbound traffic was shifted north at Mechanic Street to Pearl Street, continuing until turning south at Blackstone back to Michigan Avenue.

5|$|The team used Unreal Engine 2.5 {{to build}} and test prototypes of the {{real-time}} strategy elements, allowing the designers and gameplay programmers to commence work while another team focused on creating a new game engine. Having completed the multiplayer stage battle portion of the game first, Double Fine found it easy to gradually introduce the player to its more advanced aspects during the single-player campaign. The game-world's large size and varied content necessitated a game engine with streaming capabilities, allowing the game to seamlessly load and unload content as needed — this was also something the team had no prior experience with. Double Fine developed several in-house tools to help <b>streamline</b> <b>the</b> content-creation process for the game's world: an automated testing bot, RoBert (so named {{after one of the}} test engineers), was created to put daily builds of the game through continuous and rigorous testing, automatically reporting any errors to developers, while the Multi-User-Editor allowed the game's artists to simultaneously work on the game-world without fear of overwriting each other's work. The team ran into content management issues late in the game's development as more of the game's assets neared completion. Within the span of a few months the combined asset size tripled, endangering the game's ability to fit on a DVD and causing performance problems throughout the company's development systems. With the help of the engineering team, they were eventually able to overcome the performance issues and re-optimize the content for space.|$|E
