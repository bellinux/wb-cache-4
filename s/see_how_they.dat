5|$|Firefighting {{operations}} were resumed at about 20:00, {{and it was}} anticipated that all fires could be extinguished during the night. Further damage occurred {{to one of the}} storage tanks {{in the early hours of}} Tuesday morning, causing firefighters to be withdrawn once again, but operations resumed at 08:30. By midday on 13 December, all but three fires had been extinguished, although the largest tank was still burning.

5|$|In {{addition}} to these gunnery drills, Broke was fond of preparing hypothetical scenarios to test his crew. For example, after all hands had been drummed to quarters, he would inform them of a theoretical attack and <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> would act to defend the ship. Though the use of cutlasses in training was avoided a method of swordsmanship training called 'singlestick' was regularly practised. This was a game employing roughly similar cuts, thrusts and parries as were used with the cutlass, but as it was played with wooden sticks with wicker hand guards; hits, although painful, were not often dangerous. It soon developed quickness of eye and wrist. Many of the crew became very expert.|$|E
5|$|The {{church was}} now under a rector, who {{replaced}} the lay abbot; and any remaining priests of the clas and their abod were presumably expelled. If one accepts {{the evidence of}} the inquisition taken before Rhys ap Gruffydd, lieutenant of the Justiciar, at Llanfihangel Genau'r Glyn, 1 September 1326 (which conflicts with Gerald's account), as early as 1212 there were apparently only two monks (from St Peter's, Gloucester) in residence. However, it is difficult to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> can have remained, in light of Welsh control of the area; possibly they had only arrived in 1211; we don't know whether there was a priest resident (one of the monks might have been a priest).|$|E

25|$|Little Inferno is set {{in front}} of a brick fireplace, which the player uses to set various objects, such as toys, dolls, and electronics, on fire. The game {{encourages}} the player to burn any combination of objects to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> react when lit ablaze, as most of the objects have unique properties. Little Inferno is classified as a sandbox game as it offers few traditional objectives to complete and has no states of failure. The game was designed as a satire of similarly themed video games in which the player dedicates long amounts of time to performing tasks considered to be unrewarding.|$|E
25|$|The {{controllers}} were hard-wired to {{the console}} with no connectors for cost reasons. The game pad controllers were more-or-less copied {{directly from the}} Game & Watch machines, although the Famicom design team originally wanted to use arcade-style joysticks, even taking apart ones from American game consoles to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> worked. There were concerns regarding the durability of the joystick design and that children might step on joysticks left on the floor. Katsuyah Nakawaka attached a Game & Watch D-pad to the Famicom prototype {{and found that it}} was easy to use and caused no discomfort. Ultimately though, they installed a 15-pin expansion port {{on the front of the}} console so that an optional arcade-style joystick could be used.|$|E
25|$|Smith {{was born}} September 24, 1969 in El Paso, Texas to Ivan Smith and Janice Pvirre {{but when he}} was nine the family moved to Tampa, Florida.

In high school he became interested in carpentry, even finding a part-time job as a carpenter's assistant. He also liked to work on cars, especially old ones, and enjoyed taking things apart to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> worked, even restoring a dune buggy with a friend.

25|$|Pokkén Tournaments Nintendo-approved {{presence}} at Evo 2016 was notable as {{just three years}} prior, Nintendo attempted to block Super Smash Bros. Melee from the tournament. Yet, {{the inclusion of the}} game was also controversial among fighting game fans as popular fighting games like Street Fighter IV and Blazblue were bumped from the event in favor of Pokkén Tournament. Players from across the world traveled to Las Vegas in order to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> would match up against the game's Japanese playerbase, where the game was released for a much longer time. Red Bulls Ian Walker stated that Pokkén Tournament grew a strong community at Evo 2016, with many low-level players enjoying being among like-minded players. Walker suggested that due to the game's younger player-base, it may bolster the fighting game community strongly.|$|E
25|$|Brown's {{opponents in}} his 1999 mayoral reelection {{campaign}} were former Mayor Frank Jordan and Clint Reilly. They criticized Brown for spending the city's US$1billion in budget growth without addressing the city's major problems and creating {{an environment in}} city hall of corruption and patronage. Tom Ammiano was a late write-in candidate and he faced Brown in the runoff election. Brown won reelection by a 20 percent margin. He was supported by most major developers and business interests. Ammiano campaigned on a promise that he would {{raise the minimum wage}} to US$11 per hour and scrutinize corporate business taxes. Brown repeatedly claimed that Ammiano would raise taxes. President Clinton recorded a telephone message on Brown's behalf. Brown's campaign spent US$3.1million to Ammiano's US$300,000. The 1999 mayoral race was the subject of the documentary <b>See</b> <b>How</b> <b>They</b> Run.|$|E
25|$|In 2012 in Vietnam a {{group of}} {{scientists}} took in four Irrawaddy Dolphins and provided them with medical care to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> would survive. However, they found this to be the first case they saw Irrawaddy Dolphins to have bacterial infection. The bacertial infection, Chorioamnionitis is common in many marine animals, however when these few Dolphins were taken in the scientists discovered this same bacterial infection {{for the first time in}} this group of dolphins. This disease mostly affects animals that are pregnant because the infection occurs through the umbilical cord and goes into the maternal bloodstream. One of the dolphins the scientists in Vietnam was pregnant and before her death was found circling around the bottom of the pool and was found dead early the next morning. This bacterial infection affects many organs in the body of the animal.|$|E

25|$|Wood {{was born}} on January 28, 1981, in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, the second of three children. His parents, Debbie (née Krause) and Warren Wood, {{operated}} a delicatessen. Wood is of Austrian, Danish, English, German, and Polish descent. He was raised Roman Catholic. He has an older brother, Zachariah (born 1974), who is a video game producer at Sony, and a younger sister, Hannah (born October 7, 1983), who is an actress. At age seven, Wood began modeling in his hometown and took piano lessons. In elementary school, he appeared in The Sound of Music and played the title character in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. He also served as choir boy in a Marion Creative Council production of <b>See</b> <b>How</b> <b>They</b> Run. In 1989, his parents sold their delicatessen and the family–without his father–moved to Los Angeles for Wood to pursue an acting career. His parents divorced when he was 15.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} few years, however, {{researchers}} like Robert J. Coplan and Julie C. Bowker have bucked the trend that solitary practices and solitude are inherently dysfunctional and undesirable. In their groundbreaking work The Handbook of Solitude, the authors note how solitude can allow for enhancements in self-esteem, generates clarity, and can be highly therapeutic. In the edited work, Coplan and Bowker invite not only fellow psychology colleagues to chime in on this issue, but they also invite {{a variety of other}} faculty from different disciplines to address the issue. Arguably the most interesting of these alternative views comes from Fong's chapter on how solitude {{is more than just a}} personal trajectory for one to take inventory on life; it also yields a variety of important sociological cues that allow the protagonist to navigate through society, even highly politicized societies. In the process, political prisoners in solitary confinement were examined to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> concluded their views on society. Thus Fong, Coplan, and Bowker conclude that a person's experienced solitude generates immanent and personal content as well as collective and sociological content, depending on context.|$|E
25|$|Unlike his entrance, Weltlich's {{departure}} did {{not result}} in an exodus of players from the program. Penders' first team returned four starters from the previous season, and two talented transfers—Lance Blanks and Joey Wright—gained eligibility, giving Texas a starting five with three future NBA Draft picks and a fourth starter who would play in the NBA. Penders led his first team to a 25–9 overall record, marking the first 20-win season in ten years at Texas and the then-second-highest win total in school history. He quickly validated his promise to bring high-scoring offense to Texas: in the first nine games of the 1988–89 season, the Longhorns scored more than 100 points five times. In Bob Weltlich's 175 games as head coach, Texas had never scored 100 or more points in a game—and had only scored 90 or more points on four occasions (twice requiring an overtime period to reach that mark). The Longhorns opened the season with an 8–1 record before traveling to Oklahoma City to compete in the four-team All-College Tournament. Texas players openly marveled at the wholesale change in coaching philosophy from prior seasons to one that now encouraged them to shoot in large volumes, and some expressed eagerness to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>they</b> would fare against elite competition with their new style of play. Texas defeated the OSU Cowboys 85–84 in the first contest behind 32 points from sophomore guard Joey Wright and two late free throws from junior guard Lance Blanks, who had transferred from Virginia. The win matched Texas in the tournament final against a high-scoring, sixth-ranked Oklahoma Sooners team only nine months removed from a four-point loss as a prohibitive favorite in the 1988 national championship game. Billy Tubbs' Sooners revealed the distance that remained between Texas and college basketball's elite teams, building a 63–37 halftime lead en route to an easy 124–95 win. Texas won six games in conference play by five or fewer points to finish in second place in the SWC with a 12–4 record, with two losses to Arkansas and one loss apiece to Houston and Texas A Interspersed among the conference contests were games against NCAA Tournament-bound Vanderbilt, which Texas lost by a score of 94–79, and Miami (FL), which the Longhorns won easily, 123–104. Texas defeated both SMU and TCU in overtime in the SWC Tournament to advance to the final, in which Arkansas defeated the Longhorns {{for the third time in}} 10 weeks. Texas was subsequently selected as a No. 11 seed to play in the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 10 seasons, where the Longhorns would defeat the sixth-seeded Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, 76–70, for the program's first NCAA Tournament victory since 1972. Texas fell in the second round to the sixth-ranked and third-seeded Missouri Tigers, 108–89, to end the season at 25–9, a nine-win improvement over Weltlich's final season. The Longhorns' on-court success—in combination with Penders' appealing, fast-tempo brand of basketball and his tireless promotion of the Texas program—produced a rise in average home attendance from the prior season of almost 149 percent (from 4,028 to 10,011), the largest such increase in NCAA Division I basketball for the 1988–89 season.|$|E
