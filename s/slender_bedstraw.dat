50|$|The {{dominant}} {{chalk grassland}} community at Park Gate Down is CG4 Brachypodium pinnatum. However, fine, less vigorous grasses are also common such as sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina). The reserve supports a rich flora including many calcicoles such as common milkwort (Polygala vulgaris), small scabious (Scabiosa columbaria) and marjoram (Origanum vulgare). Notable species include <b>slender</b> <b>bedstraw</b> (Galium pumilum), adder's tongue (Ophioglossum), horseshoe Vetch (Hippocrepis comosa) and columbine (Aquilegia vulgaris).Fourteen species of orchid {{are known to}} grow at the reserve {{including some of the}} UK's rarest species. Park Gate Down is one of only three sites in the UK for the nationally rare monkey orchid (Ochis simia). The orchid was introduced to the site during the twentieth century from another Kentish site and has since flourished with over 100 plants. Park Gate Down also supports the nationally rare late spider orchid (Ophrys fuciflora) that in the UK is limited to the North Downs in East Kent as well as the nationally scarce lady orchid (Orchis purpurea) and musk orchid (Herminium monorchis) of which 72 were counted in 2007.|$|E
50|$|A {{diversity}} of soil types, slope, aspect and {{past and present}} land-use {{has given rise to}} various grassland communities. Historical evidence suggests that large areas of grassland are of great antiquity, and areas which were cultivated {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century have experienced nearly 100 years of chalk grassland re-colonisation. Parts of East Salisbury Plain and the periphery of Central and West comprise areas of grassland currently managed for grazing pasture and hay-cutting, whilst the middle of Centre and West are ungrazed. A large proportion of Salisbury Plain supports upright brome (Bromus erectus) species-rich grassland, within which a continuous floristic variation is seen. A widespread type on the plain is characterised by an abundance of red fescue (Festuca rubra), crested hair-grass (Koeleria macrantha), salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor), lady's bedstraw (Galium verum), rough hawkbit (Leontodon hispidus), common rock-rose (Helianthemum nummularium) and dropwort (Filipendula vulgaris). The high constancy of this last species is a distinctive feature of the upright brome grasslands on Salisbury Plain and is otherwise only known from one other site in Hampshire. Where upright brome is less dominating, plants such as small scabiosa (Scabiosa columbaria), clustered bellflower (Campanula glomerata), dyer's greenweed (Genista tinctoria), kidney vetch (Anthyllis vulneraria), sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia) and horseshoe vetch (Hippocrepis comosa) are characteristic associates.The rare and notable plants which occur here include burnt-tip orchid (Neotinea ustulata), <b>slender</b> <b>bedstraw</b> (Galium pumilum), field fleawort (Senecio integrifolius) and the nationally scarce British endemic early gentian (Gentianella anglica). Particularly associated with long established turf on thin rendzina soils, and rabbit-grazed areas of the eastern and central ranges, are low-growing perennials including squinancy-wort (Asperula cynanchica), chalk milkwort (Polygala calcarea), dwarf thistle (Cirsium acaule), wild thyme (Thymus praecox), the nationally scarce bastard toadflax (Thesium humifusum) and purple milk-vetch (Astragalus danicus) in its most southerly British station.|$|E
