25|$|Haughey's {{personal}} wealth and extravagant lifestyle – he owned racehorses, a large motor <b>sailing</b> <b>yacht</b> Celtic Mist, a private island, and a Gandon-designed mansion – {{had long been}} a point of curious speculation; he had refused throughout his career {{to answer any questions}} about how he financed this lifestyle on a government salary.

The northern sea route proved ice free and the three Norwegians sailed into the Bering Strait on 24 September.

The boat over-wintered in Nome, and finished the trip through the Northwest passage the following summer.|$|E
25|$|Twenty {{years after}} his accident, in 2005, Le Bon made public his desire to race again. During a touring hiatus in August 2005, Le Bon again raced Drum in the Fastnet race, {{borrowing}} the vessel from her current owner (the Late Scottish multi car garage owner Sir Arnold Clark) to participate, and raising funds for the RNLI charity. Le Bon {{had to leave the}} race unfinished, as light winds were slowing Drum (and the other competitors), and would have delayed the boat's arrival at Plymouth, interfering with Le Bon's obligation to perform in Japan. He appears as the narrator in a documentary film project called The Weekend Sailor which is about a Swan 65 <b>sailing</b> <b>yacht</b> called Sayula II that won the first Whitbread Round the World sailing race in 1973/74.|$|E
500|$|The {{advent of}} {{overseas}} travel and changes to holiday trends eventually caused the town's economy to decline after the 1960s; regular flooding of the Plenty Brook prevented redevelopment {{of the town}} centre. However, extensive seafront regeneration in the 1990s followed {{the creation of the}} Neptune's Arm sea defence jetty. The jetty has created a small harbour used by leisure boats and from where tourists can take <b>sailing</b> <b>yacht</b> trips to a seal-watching site in the Thames estuary. The Victorian gardens on the seafront were then able to be fully restored. The Central Bandstand, built in 1924, was refurbished after years of disrepair and closure to the public. A swimming pool and cinema were added to the town centre in the early 1990s. In 2005, a wind-farm with thirty 2.75MW wind turbines was built [...] off the coast of Herne Bay and Whitstable, generating a total of 82.5MW of electricity. The recent upgrades by the Council have helped improve the image of the town and raise its profile. It is hoped this will attract new investment in tourism and business by the private sector, and lead to the regeneration of the town's economy.|$|E

2500|$|In California in 1945, Bogart {{bought a}} [...] <b>sailing</b> <b>yacht,</b> the Santana, from actor Dick Powell. He found the sea a sanctuary, {{spending}} about thirty weekends {{a year on}} the water, with a particular fondness for sailing around Catalina Island. He once said, [...] "An actor needs something to stabilize his personality, something to nail down what he really is, not what he is currently pretending to be." [...] He also joined the Coast Guard Temporary Reserve offering the use of his own yacht, Santana, for Coast Guard use. [...] It was rumored Bogart attempted to enlist but was turned down because of his age.|$|E
2500|$|For a {{small boat}} (e.g. 22' / 6.7 m <b>sailing</b> <b>yacht),</b> this might consist of a heavy weight on the seabed, a 12mm or 14mm rising chain {{attached}} to the [...] "anchor", and a bridle made from 20mm nylon rope, steel cable, or a 16mm combination steel wire material. [...] The heavy weight (anchor) should be a dense material. [...] Old rail wagon wheels are used in some places (e.g. Clontarf, Dublin, Ireland) for this purpose. [...] In some harbours (e.g. Dun Laoghaire, Ireland), very heavy chain (e.g. old ship anchor chain) may {{be placed in a}} grid pattern on the sea bed to ensure orderly positioning of moorings. [...] Ropes (particularly for marker buoys and messenger lines) should be [...] "non floating" [...] to reduce likelihood of a boat's prop being fouled by one.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to being offered better, more diverse roles, Bogart started his own production company in 1948, Santana Productions, named after his <b>sailing</b> <b>yacht</b> (which also lent her name to the cabin cruiser featured in the climax of that year's smash, Key Largo). [...] Earning the right to create his own production company had left Warner Bros. head Jack Warner furious, and afraid other stars {{would do the same}} and further erode the major studios' power. In {{addition to}} the pressure they were bearing from freelancing actors like Bogart, James Stewart, Henry Fonda and others, they were beginning to buckle from the eroding impact of television and enforcement of anti-trust laws breaking up theater chains. [...] Bogart performed in his final films for Warners, Chain Lightning, released early in 1950, and The Enforcer, early in 1951.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{documents}} the rich meanings of recreational <b>sailing</b> and <b>yachting</b> in Australian waters between 1888 and 1945. It approaches <b>sailing</b> and <b>yachting</b> through two functional categories of maritime history, {{the use of}} the sea for leisure and the inspiration of the sea in culture, and considers how meanings are created through myth, legend, and ritual. By consulting newspaper articles, magazines, yachting histories and books, poetry, race programs, images and the design of boats, this thesis considers the way that <b>sailing</b> and <b>yachting</b> developed in Australian waters. By consulting secondary literature, it locates this development of <b>sailing</b> and <b>yachting</b> in the broader themes of Australian history. This thesis has found a strong tradition of <b>sailing</b> and <b>yachting</b> in Australian waters in events such as the Sydney Hobart Yacht Race and Anniversary Regattas; the rituals and traditions of <b>sailing</b> clubs and <b>yacht</b> clubs, such as the open boat clubs in Sydney, and the Royal Yacht clubs throughout the capital port cities of Australia; legends created around <b>sailing</b> and <b>yachting,</b> such as the Sydney Hobart Yacht Race, open boats, and ocean cruising; and the practices of <b>sailing</b> and <b>yachting</b> throughout the period covered. It has found that <b>sailing</b> and <b>yachting</b> developed in Australian waters between 1888 and 1945 within the broad context of modernisation. Old seafaring traditions were maintained in the context of technological changes in shipping and recreational <b>sailing.</b> <b>Yachting</b> and <b>sailing</b> was democratised as boats became more affordable, exclusive social boundaries weakened, and the pastimes were commodified. Local traditions and Britishness remained constant refrains in <b>sailing</b> and <b>yachting</b> culture during the period covered. However, in the twentieth century, local traditions have taken on national significance. This thesis had found that contemporary myths, legends, and rituals surrounding <b>sailing</b> and <b>yachting,</b> including the Sydney Hobart Yacht Race and America&# 146;s Cup, are based on a long tradition of <b>sailing</b> and <b>yachting</b> in Australian waters...|$|R
