The overall approach might be considered Constructivism (learning theory) in approach. Lecture, worksheets, and book work are often eschewed in favor of carefully constructed activities that are designed to help the learner to develop their own personal understanding. In this model, teachers will typically avoid making definitive <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>understanding</b> to the students and will instead help the students work towards their own understanding. It is uncommon to see letter grading in micro-schools. Micro-schools will often pair suggested extracurricular activities, field trips, programs, books, and other multimedia with their classes so that students will have a broader exposure to content than what is just offered in the classroom.|$|R

This group separated in 1898 {{as a result of}} differing views on who would be raised to judgment at the return of Christ. The majority of Christadelphians believe that the judgment will include anyone who had sufficient knowledge of the gospel message, and is not limited to baptized believers. The majority in Britain, Australia and North America amended their statement of faith accordingly.

As narrativas, embora ligadas pela Taverna, possuem suas particularidades na busca do esquecimento em virtude das decepÃÃes de amores frustrados e das paixÃes como objeto, seja atravÃs do imaginÃrio dos afetos, da simbologia, da HistÃria ou de outras possÃveis leituras que possam dar subsÃdios a esta dissertaÃÃo.

30|$|Having {{argued for}} the {{importance}} of philosophy for rational beings in general, the editors set about {{to address the issue of}} why philosophy is particularly germane to the enterprise of business. Rand is generally known as an apologist for capitalism. But what precisely is the connection between philosophy in general and particularly ethics and capitalism? Why is it critical that businesspeople be informed about philosophy? These issues are addressed in a number of pieces that often complement each other nicely. Rand’s piece “Wealth is the product of man’s capacity to think”, an excerpt from Atlas Shrugged, is a succinct <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> her <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> the origin and nature of wealth and its connection both to reason and to virtue. In direct contrast to Marx, Rand holds that it is reason, not labor, which is the origin of wealth. The electric generator as well as farming science are adduced as examples. In the times before these technologies were available, enormous labor was expended merely to produce enough wealth to sustain life. Examples could be multiplied. The tremendous wealth which separates modern from primitive societies in the form of abundant food, heated homes, medicine, and even ‘natural’ resources is not the result of mere labor. Its basis resides in the application of human intelligence to nature.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to assess the exposure to physical work demands of train conductors and service electricians at a railway company in the Netherlands. On-site observations were performed using the Task Recording and Analysis on Computer observation system to identify the mean duration and frequency of tasks, activities and body postures. In total, 36 train conductors and 41 service electricians were observed for a net working day of 7 h. Results showed that train conductors and service electricians climbed a flight of stairs on average 249 and 258 times, respectively, and that service electricians worked above shoulder height for 65 min on average. In both jobs, guidelines were exceeded, e. g. duration of standing, the number of times climbing a flight of stairs, kneeling and squatting or working in awkward postures, which are risk factors for developing musculoskeletal complaints. Suggestions are made concerning how to reduce these risk factors. <b>STATEMENT</b> <b>OF</b> RELEVANCE: <b>Understanding</b> physical work demands is essential for recognising risk factors for musculoskeletal disorders.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how value chain coordination affects {{the ability of}} aquaculture producers to engage in eco-certification. Through a comparison of global salmon and shrimp value chains, {{it is argued that}} production risks and producer capacity are key determinants in the type of chain coordination adopted by lead firms. The results challenge global value chain governance theory by indicating that it is hierarchical (or vertically integrated) forms of coordination that are associated with high capabilities and low risk rather than market forms of coordination. It is also shown that eco-certification {{is more likely to be}} adopted in value chains with more engaged forms of coordination. This in turn means that eco-certification is a far less 'hands off' form of regulation than widely thought. The paper concludes that for certification to engage producers operating under market forms of chain coordination new arrangements are needed that can respond to challenges of improving producer capability and production risk. <b>Statement</b> <b>of</b> relevance: By <b>understanding</b> the role <b>of</b> risk and producer capability this paper contributes to improving the application and impact of eco-certification in global aquaculture production...|$|R

It digs deeper to identify causes of inconsistencies in RBA understanding across ActionAid staff and factors affecting the project’s adherence to RBA essentials. A project being implemented by ActionAid Pakistan has been selected to limit the scope of the study. The research is qualitative and is based on primary data collected from ActionAid, implementing partner, project staff and final beneficiaries. The study also draws learning from previous literature on the subject. Interview guides, focus group discussions, general discussions and review of literature were used for data collection. Information was also obtained from respondents through telephone contact and casual discussions. A checklist derived from the UN’s <b>Statement</b> <b>of</b> Common <b>Understanding</b> on RBA (2003) was used to assess the selected project’s adherence to RBA. The study found inconsistencies in staff <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> RBA across ActionAid.

The project studied was found to be strong in adhering to some essentials of RBA e. g. relationship with the community and using empowering strategies. However, it exhibited weaknesses in adhering to other essentials e. g. monitoring processes along with outcomes and assessing capacity of duty bearers for fulfilling duties. The study concludes by advancing recommendations for ActionAid or other NGOs for improving staff understanding about RBA and for better adhering to RBA essentials in their ongoing and/or upcoming work including; institutionalization of donor funded project work, implementation of initiatives for capacity building and maintenance of a balance between advocacy and service delivery in RBA projects...|$|R
