5|$|The {{two sides}} had played each other {{earlier in the}} competition, having both been drawn in Group D in the group stage; Bayern won the group, while Manchester United {{qualified}} for the knockout phase {{as one of the}} two best runners-up across all six groups.

5|$|Each club {{needed to}} get past four rounds to reach the final. Chelsea made {{comfortable}} progress; they scored 12 goals while conceding only one to Wycombe Wanderers in the semi-final. Arsenal fielded a relatively young team throughout the competition; their wins against fellow league opponents Liverpool in the fifth-round and Tottenham Hotspur in the <b>semis</b> were acclaimed by the British press. Chelsea entered the match as favourites and were undefeated against Arsenal in all competitions since 2004.|$|E

At Wimbledon, Kuznetsova reached the quarterfinals for the second time before losing to top seed Davenport. She teamed up with Mauresmo to reach her sixth Grand Slam doubles final but suffered a heavy defeat by Cara Black and Liezel Huber.|$|E

5|$|At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China, Riner {{competed in}} the men's heavyweight event. He {{received}} a bye into {{the second round of}} the competition before beating Anis Chedli of Tunisia and Kazakhstan's Yeldos Ikhsangaliyev to advance to the semi-finals. In the <b>semis</b> he was beaten by Uzbek judoka Abdullo Tangriev on the golden score, meaning Riner had to enter the repechage rounds. In the repechage he defeated Andreas Tölzer and João Schlittler to reach a bronze medal final against Lasha Gujejiani of Georgia; Riner took the bronze medal by a score of one ippon, one yuko and one koka to nil. In December 2008 he won his second World Championship gold medal at the Open weight Championships held in Levallois-Perret, France, by beating Alexander Mikhaylin of Russia in the final.|$|E
5|$|Paes {{played in}} the 2017 season with his 111th partner, Andre Sa. The duo lost to the Indian pair of Purav Raja and Divij Sharan {{in the first round}} of Aircel Chennai Open in {{straight}} sets. With this loss, Paes moved down to the 64th rank in doubles. Though India won their Davis Cup tie against New Zealand, Paes and his last minute partner, Vishnu Vardhan, lost to the New Zealand pair of Artem Sitak and Michael Venus. Paes and Rohan Bopanna were kept as reserves by new, non-playing captain Mahesh Bhupathi for the tie against Uzbekistan. Eventually, Paes was dropped from final four, which created controversy. Paes reached the <b>semis</b> of the Dubai Open and at Delray Beach. Paes, with Adil Shamasdin, won the Leon Challenger in Mexico. With this victory, he moved to 53rd in the doubles rankings. He then paired with Scott Lipsky and won the Tallahassee Challenger title to move to 49th in the rankings. Paes and Shamasdin won the Aegon Ilkley Challenger, and Paes moved to 62nd in the rankings.|$|E
5|$|United again came {{up against}} Italian {{opposition}} in the semi-finals, facing Juventus, who had beaten Greek side Olympiacos in the quarters, and Bayern were drawn against Ukrainian side Dynamo Kyiv, who beat reigning champions Real Madrid to reach the <b>semis.</b> Both first legs finished as draws; Ryan Giggs scored in injury time to secure a 1–1 home draw for Manchester United after Antonio Conte had put Juventus ahead midway through the first half, while Bayern also had to come from behind to draw 3–3 in Kiev. A single goal from Mario Basler proved the difference between Bayern and Dynamo in the second leg, giving the Germans a 4–3 aggregate win. Manchester United fell behind early in Turin, as Filippo Inzaghi scored twice in the first 11 minutes. Goals from Keane and Yorke before half-time levelled the tie but gave United the advantage on away goals, before Andy Cole secured victory with the winning goal seven minutes from time.|$|E

5|$|In the 1998 Winter Olympics, curling {{became a}} medal sport {{for the first}} time. Olympic trials were held in November 1997 to select Canada's representatives at the Olympics. The Schmirler rink {{finished}} first in the round robin, and defeated Shannon Kleibrink in the final with a score of 9–6, behind strong shot making from Schmirler and McCusker. Schmirler made a difficult in-off to win and clinch the berth to the Olympics. The 1998 Winter Olympics were held in Nagano, Japan. The Schmirler rink was among the favourites for gold, {{but there was a}} strong field in the event. After finishing the round robin in first place with six wins and one loss, Canada played their semifinal game against Great Britain's Kirsty Hay. The game was tied after regulation play and went to an extra end, where Schmirler barely made a draw with her last rock to win the game. In the final against Denmark's Helena Blach Lavrsen, Schmirler secured a win in nine ends, winning Canada the gold medal. After winning the gold medal, Sandra appeared {{on the front page of}} the New York Times. After the Olympics, the Schmirler rink was named 'Team of the Year' by the Canadian Press. The team were also inducted into the Canadian Curling Hall of Fame in 1999. After returning from the Olympics, Schmirler and her rink had to compete almost immediately in the Scott Tournament of Hearts as Team Canada. Schmirler and her team made the playoffs, and won the 3 vs. 4 playoff game before dropping the semifinal to Anne Merklinger. After losing in the <b>semis,</b> Schmirler joined CBC as a colour commentator for the final match.|$|E
