Subunit structure is deduced, since crosslinkers bind only surface residues in relatively close proximity in the native state.

50|$|Crosslinkers are {{chemical}} reagents that {{play a crucial}} role in the preparation of conjugates used in biological research particularly immuno-technologies and protein studies. Crosslinkers are designed to covalently interact with molecules of interest, resulting in conjugation. A <b>spacer</b> <b>arm,</b> generally consisting of several atoms, separates the two molecules, and the nature and length of this spacer is important to consider when designing an assay involving the selected crosslinker. BisSulfosuccinimidyl suberate is an example of a homobifunctional crosslinker.|$|E
50|$|In the beginning, long {{chains of}} ECM {{proteins}} including fibronectin (FN), vitronectin (VN), and laminin (LN) were used, but more recently {{the advantages of}} using short peptides have been discovered. Short peptides are more advantageous because, unlike the long chains that fold randomly upon adsorption causing the active protein domains to be sterically unavailable, short peptides remain stable and do not hide the receptor binding domains when adsorbed. Another advantage to short peptides {{is that they can}} be replicated more economically due to the smaller size. A bi-functional cross-linker with a long <b>spacer</b> <b>arm</b> is used to tether peptides to the substrate surface. If a functional group is not available for attaching the cross-linker, photochemical immobilization may be used.|$|E

The adsorption of two plasma proteins (HSA and Fbg) was analysed onto the four hydrogels in flow conditions by ATR-FTIR, evaluating the adsorption kinetics and the eventual protein conformational changes.

50|$|This {{view was}} shown to be {{incorrect}} by Dingwall and Laskey in 1982. Using a protein called Nucleoplasmin, the archetypal ‘molecular chaperone’, they identified a domain in the protein {{that acts as a}} signal for nuclear entry. This work stimulated research in the area, and two years later the first NLS was identified in SV40 Large T-antigen (or SV40, for short). However, a functional NLS could not be identified in another nuclear protein simply on the basis of similarity to the SV40 NLS. In fact, {{only a small percentage of}} cellular (non-viral) nuclear proteins contained a sequence similar to the SV40 NLS. A detailed examination of Nucleoplasmin identified a sequence with two elements made up of basic amino acids separated by a <b>spacer</b> <b>arm.</b> One of these elements was similar to the SV40 NLS but was not able to direct a protein to the cell nucleus when attached to a non-nuclear reporter protein. Both elements are required. This kind of NLS has become known as a bipartite classical NLS. The bipartite NLS is now known to represent the major class of NLS found in cellular nuclear proteins and structural analysis has revealed how the signal is recognized by a receptor (importin α) protein (the structural basis of some monopartite NLSs is also known). Many of the molecular details of nuclear protein import are now known. This was made possible by the demonstration that nuclear protein import is a two-step process; the nuclear protein binds to the nuclear pore complex in a process that does not require energy. This is followed by an energy-dependent translocation of the nuclear protein through the channel of the pore complex. By establishing the presence of two distinct steps in the process the possibility of identifying the factors involved was established and led on to the identification of the importin family of NLS receptors and the GTPase Ran.|$|E
40|$|For {{studying}} penicillin G acylase (PGA) purification efficiency, various chain {{lengths of}} diamine (n = 2 - 10) were applied as <b>spacer</b> <b>arm</b> {{to prepare the}} regenerated cellulose-based immobilized metal affinity membrane (IMAM). The effects of <b>spacer</b> <b>arm</b> length on water content of the IMAM, immobilized metal ion capacity, and batch PGA adsorption were investigated. The use of 1, 10 -diaminodecane led to the smallest water content of membrane and the maximum capacity of Cu 2 + (62. 06 mu mol/disc), whereas the optimal PGA adsorption capacity (2. 6 IU/disc) was achieved with 1, 8 -diaminooctane. When applying the IMAMs with the <b>spacer</b> <b>arm</b> of 1, 8 -diaminooctane to the flow chromatographic experiments, a performance of 2. 73 -fold purification and 70. 27 % recovery was obtained.

The <b>spacer</b> <b>arm</b> is constituted of a carbon chain including a variable number of methylene groups (n = 2 – 11). To improve the ability of the fullerene carriage, two arms are presented simultaneously through a malonyl bridge.

Biological macromolecules were found to better retain their functional activity when immobilized on hydrophilic materials. Polyacrylamide is a common material for solid-phase carriers of biological macromolecules, including immunoreagents used in affinity chromatography. New macroformats for immunoassay modified with activated polyacrylamide derivatives seem to be promising. Results New polymeric matrices for immunoassay in the form of 0. 63 -cm balls which contain hydrazide functional groups on hydrophilic polymer <b>spacer</b> <b>arms</b> at their surface shell are synthesized by modification of aldehyde-containing polystyrene balls with hydrazide derivatives of poly(meth) acrylic acid.

40|$|AbstractAnalogues of neuropeptide Y (NPY) {{containing}} small N- and C-terminal segments linked via flexible <b>spacer</b> <b>arms</b> {{were found}} to exhibit receptor binding affinity constants almost as high as NPY as well as post- and presynaptic NPY-agonistic activities. One {{of the most active}} analogues contains N-terminal NPY segment 1 – 4 linked via ε-aminocaproic acid (Aca) to the C-terminal partially α-helical peptide amide segment 25 – 36. NPY 1 – 4 -Aca- 25 – 36 is the first highly potent NPY agonist, which is of considerably reduced size in comparison to the native hormone. The analogues are accessible by solid-phase synthesis using Fmoc strategy...|$|R

Three carbohydrate-based templates containing four protected N-terminal arms were synthesised from glucose and galactose. Methyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside was converted to two derivatives bearing a carboxylic acid handle for attachment to solid supports, <b>spacer</b> <b>arms</b> of differing hydrophilicity, and phthaloyl-protected amino groups suitable for peptide chain extension. beta-D-Galactopyranosyl azide was converted to a template bearing a carboxylic acid handle and four BOC-protected amines. All the templates {{were found to be}} suitable for attachment to solid supports and subsequent cleavage from resins, using either BOC- or FMOC-methodologies...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{series of}} covalently bonded {{ferrocene}} derivatives to carbon nanotubes via either alkyl or poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) spacers has been prepared and deposited onto glassy carbon electrodes using chitosan as a binder. Evaluation {{of the effect}} of <b>spacer</b> <b>arms</b> revealed that the hydrophilic and flexible PEG chain greatly facilitates electron transfer reactions. When adding diaphorase in the composite, effective electrocatalytic oxidation of NADH was achieved. The PEG spacer also permitted an efficient dispersion of the functionalized carbon nanotubes, without additives. In this way, they can be easily incorporated in water-based sol-gel matrices, as illustrated for bioelectrochemical applications with co-immobilized glucose dehydrogenase, diaphorase and NAD(+) cofactor...|$|R
