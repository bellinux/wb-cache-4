5|$|Spokane {{became an}} {{important}} rail and <b>shipping</b> <b>center</b> because of its location between mining and farming areas. In the early 1880s, gold and silver were discovered in the Inland Empire; as a regional <b>shipping</b> <b>center,</b> the city furnished supplies to the miners who passed through {{on their way to}} the mineral-rich Coeur d'Alene, Colville and Kootenay districts. The mining districts are still considered among the most productive in North America.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{this period}} {{represented}} a high point in Galveston's economy. It is {{sometimes referred to as}} the open era or the wide-open era because the business owners and the community made little effort to hide the illegal vice activities. The tourist industry spawned by the illegal businesses helped to offset Galveston's decline as a commercial and <b>shipping</b> <b>center</b> following a devastating hurricane in 1900. However, crackdowns against gambling and prostitution in Texas during the mid-20th century made these businesses increasingly difficult to sustain. By the 1950s, this era of Galveston's history had ended.|$|E
5|$|Unlike many Midwestern cities its age, Dayton {{has very}} broad and {{straight}} downtown streets (generally {{two or three}} full lanes in each direction) that improved access to the downtown even after the automobile became popular. The main reason for the broad streets was that Dayton was a marketing and <b>shipping</b> <b>center</b> from its beginning; streets were broad to enable wagons drawn by teams of three to four pairs of oxen to turn around. In addition, some of today's streets were once barge canals flanked by draw-paths.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century the region {{gave birth to}} some of the state's {{earliest}} oil fields and refineries as the Texas Oil Boom took hold. Refining and manufacturing grew rapidly in the area, particularly around Baytown, Pasadena, and Texas City. The opening of the Port of Texas City, and later Barbours Cut and Bayport, gradually established the region as an important <b>shipping</b> <b>center.</b> As wealth increased in southeast Texas, resorts and other tourist draws developed in the Bay Area. During the 1960s the area became home of the Johnson Space Center, headquarters for the nation's manned space program, which helped diversify the regional economy and began the development of an aerospace industry, and later other high-tech industries.|$|E

25|$|By 1914, {{neglect and}} lack of use due to {{diversion}} of freight traffic to railroad lines resulted in the Red River becoming unnavigable. In 1994, the United States Army Corps of Engineers restored navigability by completion {{of a series of}} lock-and-dam structures and a navigation channel. Today, Shreveport-Bossier City is being re-developed as a port and <b>shipping</b> <b>center.</b>|$|E
25|$|During the 1850s, Marquette {{was linked}} by rail to {{numerous}} mines {{and became the}} leading <b>shipping</b> <b>center</b> of the Upper Peninsula. The first ore pocket dock, designed by an early town leader, John Burt, was built by the Cleveland Iron Mining Company in 1859. By 1862, the city had a population of over 1,600 and a soaring economy.|$|E

In this paper, the development strategies of <b>shipping</b> <b>centers</b> and transportation network are discussed based on economic globalization tendency. The results argue that a united transportation network should be built in order to promote the economic competition of Northeast Asia in the world. As a key component of the economic cooperation, a hierarchical <b>shipping</b> <b>centers</b> network should be established with Hang Kong, Shanghai, Pusan, Kobe, and Tokyo as cores. The authorities of China, Japan, R. O. Korea and D. P. R. Korea should make more efforts to build a set of cooperation institutions based on raising the transportation efficiency...|$|R
25|$|Henry B. Plant's {{railroad}} line {{reached the}} area in 1884 and ran across the Interbay Peninsula to Old Tampa Bay, where he built the town and shipping facility of Port Tampa at its terminus. In 1898, Plant used his connections {{in the federal government}} to make Port Tampa a major embarkation point for the U.S. Army during the Spanish–American War, leading to the U.S. Congress appropriating funds for the United States Army Corps of Engineers to begin the first large dredging operation in Tampa Bay. A deep shipping channel was created which linked Port Tampa to the mouth of the bay, enabling Plant to greatly expand his steamship line. In 1917, the Corps of Engineers dredged another channel from the mouth of Tampa Bay to the Port of Tampa, instantly making the city an important <b>shipping</b> <b>center.</b>|$|E
25|$|The primary {{economic}} {{enterprise of}} the county was rice planting, particularly along the Satilla River. Sea Island cotton was grown on Cumberland Island, and short-staple cotton was grown on the mainland along with sugar cane. Various forest products including turpentine and timber were produced, mainly for consumption in the naval industry and the West Indies. Camden County {{also served as a}} hub of backcountry trade with American settlers and various Indian groups, and as a shipyard and <b>shipping</b> <b>center</b> centered around the town of St. Marys. The land in Camden County was owned by fewer than 300 people throughout the colonial and antebellum eras. Most of the white population worked in trades or as tenant farmers, while nearly all black residents were slaves. Until the 1840s (and increasingly strict black codes), Camden County had a small population of free black workers, mainly involved in day labor or maritime industry.|$|E
500|$|The {{opening of}} Houston Ship Channel in 1914 {{led to the}} Port of Houston {{overtaking}} the Port of Galveston as the state's dominant seaport. The situation led Houston to also overtake Galveston as the primary <b>shipping</b> <b>center</b> for cotton. The large quantities {{of oil and gas}} moving through Houston, Baytown, Texas City, and surrounding communities made the area around the ship channel attractive for industrial development. Chemical plants, steel factories, cement plants, automobile manufacturing, and many other types of heavy industry that could benefit from a ready supply of cheap fuel rapidly developed in the area. By the 1930s, Houston had emerged as the state's dominant economic center, though it continued to compete with Dallas throughout the 1900s. The effects of the boom helped offset the effects of the Depression so much that Houston was called the [...] "city the Depression forgot." [...] Dallas and other Texas communities were also able to weather the Depression better than many American cities because of oil.|$|E

500|$|Invasive {{species in}} the Everglades are exotic plants and animals that are not native to the area and have aggressively adapted to {{conditions}} in wilderness areas in southern Florida. The Everglades are a massive watershed in the southern portion of the U.S. state of Florida that drains overflow from the vast shallow Lake Okeechobee that is in turn fed by the Kissimmee River. The overflow forms a very shallow river about [...] wide and [...] long that travels {{about half a mile}} per day. The network of ecosystems created by the Everglades are surrounded by urban areas to the east in the South Florida metropolitan area, to the west by Naples and Fort Myers, and to the south by Florida Bay, a marine environment that receives fresh water from and is maintained by the Everglades. As it is surrounded on three sides and close to a major transportation and <b>shipping</b> <b>center,</b> it is particularly vulnerable to the importation of exotic species.|$|E
2500|$|The Town of Largo was {{incorporated}} in 1905. Lake Largo was drained in 1916 {{to make way}} for growth and development. Between 1910 and 1930, Largo's population increased about 500%. Then and for decades afterwards, Largo's economy was based on agriculture—citrus groves, cattle ranches, and hog farms, as well as turpentine stills and sawmills. Largo is best remembered as [...] "Citrus City", from the time it was a citrus packing, canning and <b>shipping</b> <b>center.</b>|$|E
2500|$|From the town's {{founding}} in 1835, business activities included real estate, transportation, and retail sales. Later, other businesses were formed, especially in railroad construction and operation, new building construction, lumber sales, and communications. The Port of Beaumont became a successful regional <b>shipping</b> <b>center.</b> [...] Beaumont {{was a small}} center for cattle raisers and farmers in its early years. With an active riverport by the 1880s, it became an important lumber and rice-milling town. It exported rice as a commodity crop.|$|E

2500|$|The Canal {{nonetheless}} {{provided an}} economic boost for Georgetown. In the 1820s and 1830s, Georgetown {{was an important}} <b>shipping</b> <b>center.</b> [...] Tobacco and other goods were transferred between the canal and shipping on the Potomac River. [...] As well, salt was imported from Europe, and sugar and molasses were imported from the West Indies. [...] These shipping industries were later superseded by coal and flour industries, which flourished with the C & O Canal providing cheap power for mills and other industry. In 1862, the Washington and Georgetown Railroad Company began a horsecar line running along M Street in Georgetown and Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, easing travel between the two cities.|$|E
2500|$|The town {{grew from}} a sleepy {{agricultural}} village (in 1824), and {{was transformed into}} a transportation hub and <b>shipping</b> <b>center</b> as the Delaware terminus of the Morris Canal (1829-1924), the first transportation infrastructure project (of several, each eventually) giving the community a direct connection [...] to New York City. The Central Railroad of New Jersey would soon follow with a connection, but the community's growth (and for a long while, its importance) was that it reached the canal terminals of both the Delaware Canal and the Lehigh Canal by its cross-river cable ferry system to Easton, PA. In 1853, the Lehigh Valley Railroad connected across the river with the CNJ and a passenger shortline railroad, the Belvidere Delaware Railroad, as well as the Morris Canal, all within Phillipsburg. Rapid growth followed quickly.|$|E
2500|$|In its {{earliest}} days, Lafayette was a <b>shipping</b> <b>center</b> on the Wabash River. In 1838, Henry Leavitt Ellsworth, the first United States Patent Commissioner, published a booklet titled Valley of the Upper Wabash, Indiana, with Hints on Its Agricultural Advantages, to promote {{settlement of the}} region. By 1845, Ellsworth had purchased [...] of farmland in and around Lafayette and moved there from Connecticut to supervise land sales. By 1847 Ellsworth was distributing broadsides looking for farmers to purchase his farmland. He {{became president of the}} Tippecanoe County Agricultural Society in April 1851 – despite some local resentment over what was called [...] "the Yale Crowd" [...] – but he was defeated the same year when he ran for the Indiana House of Representatives.
