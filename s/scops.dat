25|$|Due to a nomenclatorial dispute, {{the generic}} name <b>Scops</b> {{is not used}} by either the <b>scops</b> or the screech owls (which when only a few species were known were placed together), nor by any other animal. In 1760, Mathurin Jacques Brisson had {{established}} the genus Scopus for the hammerkop, a peculiar African bird. Paul Möhring in 1758 had already used the name <b>Scops</b> for this bird however, and believing this name to be valid Morten Thrane Brünnich replaced Scopus with it in 1772. The <b>scops</b> and screech owls, which were placed in Otus by Thomas Pennant in 1769 (as he too believed that Moehring's <b>Scops</b> was valid) were moved to <b>Scops</b> by Marie Jules César Savigny in 1809.

40|$|Summary: The {{database}} <b>SCOP</b> (Structural Classification Of Proteins) {{has become}} a major resource in bioinformatics and protein science.

40|$|SummaryBecause {{activation}} of ERK 1 / 2 MAP kinase (MAPK) {{is critical for}} hippocampus-dependent memory, there is considerable interest in mechanisms for regulation of MAPK during memory formation. Here we report that MAPK and CREB-mediated transcription are negatively regulated by <b>SCOP</b> (suprachiasmatic nucleus [SCN] circadian oscillatory protein) and that <b>SCOP</b> is proteolyzed by calpain when hippocampal neurons are stimulated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), KCl depolarization, or NMDA. Moreover, training for novel object memory decreases <b>SCOP</b> in the hippocampus. To determine if hippocampus-dependent memory is influenced by <b>SCOP</b> in vivo, we generated a transgenic mouse strain for the inducible overexpression of <b>SCOP</b> in the forebrain. Overexpression of <b>SCOP</b> completely blocked memory for novel objects. We conclude that degradation of <b>SCOP</b> by calpain contributes to {{activation of}} MAPK during memory formation...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} and prediction of protein-protein interaction sites from structural data, is restricted by by the limited availability of structural complexes {{that represent the}} complete protein-protein interaction space. The domain classification schemes CATH and <b>SCOP</b> are normally used independently in the {{analysis and}} prediction of protein domain-domain interactions. In this paper, the effect of different domain classification schemes on the number and type of domain-domain interactions observed in structural data is systematically evaluated for the <b>SCOP</b> and CATH hierarchies. Although {{there is a large}} overlap in domain assignments between <b>SCOP</b> and CATH, 23. 6 % of CATH interfaces had no <b>SCOP</b> equivalent and 37. 3 % of <b>SCOP</b> interfaces had no CATH equivalent in a non redundant set. Therefore, combining both classifications gives an increase of between 23. 6 % and 37. 3 % in domain-domain interfaces. It is suggested that if possible, both domain classification schemes should be used together, but if only one is selected, <b>SCOP</b> provides better coverage than CATH. Employing both <b>SCOP</b> and CATH reduces the false negative rate of predictive methods which employ homology matching to structural data to predict protein-protein interaction by an estimated 6. 5 %. 86. 5 % of the structures in which CATH interfaces had no equivalent <b>SCOP</b> interface can be attributed to <b>SCOP</b> assigning a single domain to the region while CATH assigns two separate domains where as only 22. 5 % of <b>SCOP</b> interfaces were in this category...|$|R
25|$|As {{opposed to}} screech owls, <b>scops</b> owls {{have only a}} single type of call. This {{consists}} {{of a series of}} whistles or high-pitched hoots, given with a frequency of 4 calls per second or less, or of a single, drawn-out whistle. Calls differ widely between species in type and pitch, and in the field are often the first indication of these birds' presence, as well as the most reliable means to distinguish between species. Some, like the recently described Serendib <b>scops</b> owl (Otus thilohoffmanni), were discovered because their vocalizations were unfamiliar to experts in bird-calls.|$|E
25|$|<b>Scops</b> owls hunt from perches in semi-open landscapes. They prefer areas {{which contain}} old trees with hollows; these {{are home to}} their prey which {{includes}} insects, reptiles, small mammals such as bats and mice and other small birds. The owls will also eat earthworms, amphibians and aquatic invertebrates. <b>Scops</b> owls have {{a good sense of}} hearing which helps them locate their prey in any habitat. They also possess well-developed raptorial claws and a curved bill, both of which are used for tearing their prey into pieces small enough to swallow easily.|$|E

40|$|Overexpression of {{suprachiasmatic nucleus}} {{circadian}} oscillatory protein (<b>SCOP),</b> a negative ERK regulator, blocks long-term memory encoding. Inhibition of calpain-mediated <b>SCOP</b> degradation also prevents {{the formation of}} long-term memory, suggesting rapid <b>SCOP</b> breakdown is necessary for memory encoding. However, whether <b>SCOP</b> levels also control the magnitude of long-term synaptic plasticity is unknown. Here we show that following synaptic activity-induced <b>SCOP</b> degradation, <b>SCOP</b> is rapidly replaced via mTOR-mediated protein synthesis. We further show that early <b>SCOP</b> degradation is specifically catalyzed by µ–calpain while late <b>SCOP</b> re-synthesis is mediated by m-calpain. We propose that µ–calpain promotes long-term potentiation induction by degrading <b>SCOP</b> and activating ERK, while m-calpain activation limits the magnitude of potentiation by terminating the ERK response via enhanced <b>SCOP</b> synthesis. This unique braking mechanism {{could account for the}} advantages of spaced vs. massed training in the formation of long-term memory. Keywords SCOP; calpain; LTP; induction; consolidation; learning and memory Long-term potentiation (LTP) of glutamatergic transmission induced by brief, patterned stimulation of afferents fulfills several requirements for a high-capacity memory mechanism, including rapid induction, extreme persistence and synapse specificity 1.

40|$|Abstract Background Domain experts {{manually}} {{construct the}} Structural Classification of Protein (<b>SCOP)</b> database to categorize and compare protein structures. Even though using the <b>SCOP</b> database {{is believed to}} be more reliable than classification results from other methods, it is labor intensive. To mimic human classification processes, we develop an automatic <b>SCOP</b> fold classification system to assign possible known <b>SCOP</b> folds and recognize novel folds for newly-discovered proteins. Results With a sufficient amount of ground truth data, our system is able to assign the known folds for newly-discovered proteins in the latest <b>SCOP</b> v 1. 69 release with 92. 17 % accuracy. Our system also recognizes the novel folds with 89. 27 % accuracy using 10 fold cross validation. The average response time for proteins with 500 and 1409 amino acids to complete the classification process is 4. 1 and 17. 4 seconds, respectively. By comparison with several structural alignment algorithms, our approach outperforms previous methods on both the classification accuracy and efficiency. Conclusion In this paper, we build an advanced, non-parametric classifier to accelerate the manual classification processes of <b>SCOP.</b> With satisfactory ground truth data from the <b>SCOP</b> database, our approach identifies relevant domain knowledge and yields reasonably accurate classifications.

40|$|Background: the {{cholinergic}} system {{is important in}} learning processes and probably influences behavioral sensitization to drugs. This study {{examined the effects of}} scopolamine (<b>scop),</b> a muscarinic antagonist, on the behavioral sensitization to ethanol (EtOH) stimulant effect in mice. Methods: in experiments 1 and 2, male Swiss albino mice received saline or 1. 0 mg/kg <b>scop</b> (s. c.) + saline or EtOH (i. p). (1. 0 g/kg in experiment 1 and 2. 2 g/kg in experiment 2), for 21 days. Locomotor activity (LA) was recorded once a week, being the treatment withdrawn for 7 days after the last test. On the 28 th day (challenge 1), they were evaluated under saline or EtOH. in experiment 2, 3 days after the first challenge, they were tested in an open-field arena, under saline or 2. 2 g/kg EtOH. Three days after this, mice were tested under saline or 1. 0 mg/kg <b>scop</b> in the activity cages. Results:Acutely, EtOH and <b>scop</b> did not alter the LA. However, when both drugs were coadministered, a significant reduction was observed. During the treatment, tolerance to the depressor effect was developed and behavioral sensitization observed only in the saline + 2. 2 EtOH group. in challenge 1, the groups <b>scop</b> + 1. 0 EtOH, saline + 2. 2 EtOH, and <b>scop</b> + 2. 2 EtOH presented higher levels of LA than that of the control groups. However, in challenge 2, conducted in a different setting, no differences between groups were observed. in challenge 3, when the animals received <b>scop,</b> both groups pretreated with 2. 2 g/kg EtOH (saline + 2. 2 EtOH and <b>scop</b> + 2. 2 EtOH groups) presented higher levels of activity suggesting an interaction between EtOH and <b>scop.</b> Conclusions:Although the coadministration of scopolamine had impaired the observation of sensitization on the 21 st day test, when the group <b>scop</b> + EtOH was challenged with <b>scop</b> + EtOH, it seems that the <b>scop</b> just masked the observation, but did not impair the development, of the EtOH-sensitization observed in the challenge with EtOH alone. the higher levels of LA in groups pretreated with EtOH only in the cages but not in the open-field arena confirm the importance of environmental factors, such as the context of drug administration and testing.

500|$|A {{subcommittee}} {{was set up}} in 1997 {{to undertake}} a review of rare bird records from the years immediately prior to BBRC's establishment. The purpose of the review was to ensure that all records from 1950 onwards (the cut-off date for Category A of the BOU British List of birds) have been subjected to a similar level of scrutiny. Not all of the 1,100 records of species considered to be rarities at that time were assessed, but only those related to species not recorded more than 100 times by 1997, as well as a few records of less rare species under particularly unusual circumstances, which were termed [...] "sore thumbs". Much of the original documentation was unavailable for the review, as it had been lost, and so for many records, the review was based solely on published accounts of the birds. The most notable outcome of this review was the reidentification of a frigatebird record from Tiree in 1953. Previously identified as a magnificent frigatebird, the BBRC review concluded that the bird was in fact an Ascension frigatebird, the only individual of this species ever identified in Europe (Walbridge, Small & McGowan 2003). The full results of the review were published in 2006. Of the 126 records reviewed, 37 were rejected as unacceptable. These included a claimed white-tailed eagle, which broke into a chicken-run in a garden and stole a chicken, three little crakes, three European <b>scops</b> owls, the only late December record of tawny pipit, three black-eared wheatears, a record of two White's thrushes together in April, a spring lanceolated warbler, two moustached warblers and a pine grosbeak. Furthermore, issues were found with the identification of Britain's first western sandpiper, on Fair Isle in 1956, and these led the BOURC to reject this record. The western sandpiper has been recorded several times subsequently in Britain however, and remains on the national list. The subcommittee's final report also hints at the prospect that some records from immediately prior to 1950 may be incorrect; because these fell outside the timeframes of the review they were not reassessed.|$|E
