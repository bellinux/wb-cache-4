5|$|The species {{grows in}} sand dunes of white, white-grey or {{yellow-brown}} sand, amongst {{a system of}} ephemeral salt creeks. Populations occur both in low-lying areas near creeks, and atop dunes.

5|$|July 13, 1996- Tropical Storm Bertha crosses {{over the}} state with a peak wind gust of 58mph (93km/h) at Dover. The winds down <b>scattered</b> <b>trees,</b> signs, and power lines, leaving 3,200 homes without power for 8hours. The storm {{produces}} moderate rainfall across the state, causing drainage problems. Prior to moving across the state, Bertha causes rough surf, resulting in 40 water rescues. Overall damage is minor, and no deaths occurred.|$|E

5|$|This {{species is}} {{prevalent}} in most woodland types in its range, {{and also in}} more open country with <b>scattered</b> <b>trees.</b> Eurasian sparrowhawks prefer to hunt the edges of wooded areas, but migrant birds {{can be seen in}} any habitat. The increased proportion of medium-aged stands of trees created by modern forestry techniques have benefited Accipiter nisus, according to a Norwegian study. Unlike its larger relative the northern goshawk, it can be seen in gardens and in urban areas and will even breed in city parks.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, several {{woodpeckers}} {{are under}} threat as their habitats are destroyed. Being woodland birds, deforestation and clearance {{of land for}} agriculture and other purposes can reduce populations dramatically. Some species adapt to living in plantations and secondary growth, or to open countryside with forest remnants and <b>scattered</b> <b>trees,</b> but some do not. A few species have even flourished when they have adapted to man-made habitats. There are few conservation projects directed primarily at woodpeckers, but they benefit whenever their habitat is conserved. The red-cockaded woodpecker {{has been the focus}} of much conservation effort in the southeastern United States, with artificial cavities being constructed in the longleaf pines they favour as nesting sites.|$|E
5|$|The Australian magpie prefers open {{areas such}} as grassland, fields and {{residential}} {{areas such as}} parks, gardens, golf courses, and streets, with <b>scattered</b> <b>trees</b> or forest nearby. Birds nest and shelter in trees but forage mainly {{on the ground in}} these open areas. It has also been recorded in mature pine plantations; birds only occupy rainforest and wet sclerophyll forest in the vicinity of cleared areas. In general, evidence suggests the range and population of the Australian magpie has increased with land-clearing, although local declines in Queensland due to a 1902 drought, and in Tasmania in the 1930s have been noted; the cause for the latter is unclear but rabbit baiting, pine tree removal, and spread of the masked lapwing (Vanellus miles) have been implicated.|$|E
30|$|Despite {{the recent}} {{advances}} in tree-level identification, {{it is challenging to}} obtain stand-level information on aspen in remote sensing-based forest inventories. Correspondingly, the accuracy estimates have been rather low for aspen, or it has been completely ignored in traditional field inventories. Since the trend in forest inventories is toward remote sensing applications, rare and <b>scattered</b> <b>tree</b> species, such as aspen, could become neglected in inventories. On the other hand, there is an increasing need to have forest inventory information on aspen, especially in conservation areas where the occurrence and long-term persistence of <b>scattered</b> aspen <b>trees</b> may be crucial for many conservation-dependent species.|$|R

5|$|The willie wagtail {{is at home}} in a {{wide variety}} of habitats, but avoids densely forested areas such as rainforest. It prefers semi-open {{woodland}} or grassland with <b>scattered</b> <b>trees,</b> often near wetlands or bodies of water. In New Guinea, it inhabits man-made clearings and grasslands, as well as open forest and mangroves. On Guadalcanal, it was reported from open areas and coconut groves. It has responded well to human alteration of the landscape and can often be seen hunting in open, grassed areas such as lawns, gardens, parkland, and sporting grounds. The species spread into the Western Australian Wheatbelt after the original vegetation had been cleared for agriculture.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} boobook {{is found}} across Australia, although is scarce in more arid regions such as western New South Wales, southwestern and western Queensland, much of South Australia {{away from the}} coast and interior Western Australia and Northern Territory. In drier areas it is generally found along watercourses such as the Darling and Paroo Rivers, and Lake Eyre basin. It is found on numerous offshore islands such as Groote Eylandt, Melville Island, Mornington Island in the Gulf of Carpentaria and many islands off eastern Australia. It is found in southern New Guinea, Roti, Timor and surrounding islands in Indonesia. It is found {{in a wide range}} of habitats, from forest and open woodland to scrubland and semi-desert areas. In Australia it resides in mainly Eucalypt forests. It has adapted to landscapes altered by human activity and is found in farmland and suburban areas as long as there are some <b>scattered</b> <b>trees.</b> In fact, it can adapt to any habitat as long as there are some trees present.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} different microhabitats in a wood; coniferous forest, broad-leafed forest, open woodland, <b>scattered</b> <b>trees,</b> woodland verges, clearings and glades; tree trunk, branch, twig, bud, leaf, flower and fruit; rough bark, smooth bark, damaged bark, rotten wood, hollow, groove and hole; canopy, shrub layer, plant layer, leaf litter and soil; buttress root, stump, fallen log, stem base, grass tussock, fungus, fern and moss. The greater the structural {{diversity in the}} wood, the greater the number of microhabitats that will be present. A range of tree species with individual specimens of varying sizes and ages, {{and a range of}} features such as streams, level areas, slopes, tracks, clearings and felled areas will provide suitable conditions for an enormous number of biodiverse plants and animals. For example, in Britain {{it has been estimated that}} various types of rotting wood are home to over 1700 species of invertebrate.|$|E

25|$|Under certain {{combinations}} of physical circumstances in the UK, <b>scattered</b> <b>trees</b> can occur {{across the surface}} of a bog in a relatively stable ecological relationship as open woodland, without the loss of bog species. This true Bog woodland is a much rarer condition than the progressive invasion of bogs by trees, through natural colonisation or afforestation following changes in the drainage pattern which leads eventually to the loss of the bog community. The habitat type has not previously been well described in the UK, and consequently knowledge of its ecological characteristics is limited.|$|E
25|$|Swainson's hawk, the red-tailed hawk (B. jamaicensis) and the {{ferruginous}} hawk (B. regalis) compete for territory, and defend territories against each other. In {{many parts of}} the plains these three species nest in the same general area and exploit much the same prey base. Although diets overlap greatly, habitats may not overlap as much. In Oregon, Swainson's hawk selects nesting trees having a different configuration than those used by red-tailed or {{ferruginous hawk}}s. In southern Alberta, different nesting habitats help reduce food competition, with Swainson's hawk favoring areas with <b>scattered</b> <b>trees</b> or riparian borders, while red-tailed hawks nest in stands of tall trees, and ferruginous hawks nest on the open plains.|$|E

25|$|Savannas {{maintain}} an open canopy despite a high tree density. It is often believed that savannas feature widely spaced, <b>scattered</b> <b>trees.</b> However, in many savannas, tree densities are higher and trees are more regularly spaced than in forests. The South American savanna types cerrado sensu stricto and cerrado dense typically have densities of trees similar to or {{higher than that}} found in South American tropical forests, with savanna rangingt 800–3300 trees per hectare (trees/ha) and adjacent forests with 800–2000trees/ha. Similarly Guinean savanna has 129trees/ha, compared to 103 for riparian forest, while Eastern Australian sclerophyll forests have average tree densities of approximately 100 per hectare, comparable to savannas in the same region.|$|E
25|$|Swainson's hawks hunt using various methods. Many still-hunt, {{watching}} for prey activity from a perch {{such as a}} tree, bush, pylon, telephone pole, hummock or other high object. Others hunt by soaring over open ground with wings held in a dihedral, using their stellar vision to watch for prey activity below. It occasionally courses low over the ground like a northern harrier (Circus cyaneus) or hovers like a rough-legged hawk (B. lagopus) while hunting. They frequently engage in transect-glides while actively hunting in flight. It commonly perches on the ground both during migration and on the breeding grounds. While hunting on the ground, almost entirely for large insects, their gait can appear awkward but they are often successful in pinning down several insects per day. During migration, it typically roosts for the night on bare ground with <b>scattered</b> <b>trees,</b> a habit that distinguishes it from fellow long-distance migrants such as the broad-winged hawk (B. platypterus), which roosts in closed-canopy woodlands.|$|E
25|$|Additional formal {{terraces}} {{and informal}} ornamental gardens were {{made up in}} the 19th and 20th centuries, initially replacing the former sweep of parkland up to the frontage of the house shown on maps up to 1841. Oswald Augustus Smith (who purchased Hammerwood in 1864) was probably responsible for laying out the ornamental gardens {{to the east of}} the house. As the cousin of Augustus Smith (the founder of Tresco Abbey Gardens in the Isles of Scilly, where rhododendrons feature in the planting) he introduced them to Hammerwood and they remain today. The Smiths also planted the gardens with specimen trees and made up gravel paths through the bushes, shrubberies and woodland to the east (these are shown on the OS map of 1873). In 1927, a Yew Garden was introduced below the south terrace; it has been restored and is now a registered helicopter landing site. Until the mid-20th century, the parkland on the valley slopes to the south of the lakes was mainly wooded; it is now under arable cultivation, for which it was largely cleared of trees in the 1950s. A few <b>scattered</b> <b>trees</b> remain from the extensive pattern shown established on the map of 1808.|$|E

40|$|This paper scrutinizes {{determinants}} of regional-level institutions regulating {{the provision of}} biodiversity and ecosystem services. Two cases of maintaining ecosystem services, provided by quite different resource systems, are compared: the protection of wolves and the management of a high nature value agroforestry system, <b>scattered</b> fruit <b>tree</b> meadows. Taking an abductive approach, we suggest that the distinct characteristics of resources – in particular the mobility of resource units – and differences in the overarching European regulatory framework – the obligation to protect wolves versus voluntary compensation payments to maintain <b>scattered</b> fruit <b>tree</b> meadows – largely explain the existing institutional structures at regional level. Cost-effectiveness considera-tions concerning the transaction costs of governance seem to act as determinants for the design and implementation of regional institutions.
