25|$|Continuous {{reporting}} {{is a point}} of constant debate. Some parties, including analysts and investors, are interested in knowing how a company is doing at a given point in time. They argue that near real-time information would provide them with the ability to take advantage of important business moves as they happen. However, opponents are skeptical of how the raw information can be useful and fear information overload, or that there would be too much irrelevant information out there. Additionally, some companies are fearful that continuously reported financial information would give away important <b>strategic</b> <b>moves</b> and undermine competitive advantage.|$|E
500|$|While GamePro {{gave the}} game perfect ratings in {{controls}} and fun, Next Generation considered the controls as awkward {{as they were}} on the Super NES and ultimately wrote that the game was [...] "not much fun". Many reviewers criticized how Gold combo-based gameplay diminished the importance of skill. IGN wrote that this shallow emphasis on [...] "archaic" [...] combo sequence memorization prevented creative improvisation. CVG wrote that Gold had little [...] "flow": every match was focused on huge combos rather than small, <b>strategic</b> <b>moves.</b> Thus, players were forced to train before they could effectively produce combos long enough to win matches. Multiple reviewers praised its training mode, which CVG also liked in the game's Super NES predecessor.|$|E
40|$|The <b>strategic</b> {{commitment}} <b>moves</b> {{that game}} theory predicts players make may sometimes seem counter-intuitive. We therefore conducted an experiment {{to see if}} people make the predicted <b>strategic</b> <b>move.</b> The experiment uses a simple bargaining situation. A player can make a <b>strategic</b> <b>move</b> of committing to not seeing what another player will demand. Our data show that subjects do, but only after substantial time, learn to make the predicted <b>strategic</b> <b>move.</b> We find only weak evidence of physical timing effects. strategic moves; commitment; bargaining; strategic value of information; physical timing effects; endogenous timing; experiment...|$|R

2500|$|Smith's <b>strategic</b> <b>moves</b> in the World Series drew praise {{even from}} those who had {{previously}} been critics. [...] Smith's most dramatic strategic call was his decision to continue playing center-fielder Mickey Stanley at shortstop, for all seven games of the World Series. [...] Even Smith's closest friends questioned the move, and critics gravely opined that he was weakening the Tigers at two positions, given Stanley's Gold Glove season in center field. [...] While Stanley made two errors, neither led to a Cardinal run, and his play at shortstop was generally solid. More importantly, the move allowed Smith to keep both Jim Northrup and Al Kaline in the line-up, and each had key hits to fuel the Tigers' comeback against the Cardinals. [...] Kaline had a [...]379 batting average in the World Series with two home runs, eight RBIs, and the game-winning hit in Game 5. [...] Northrup also belted two home runs (including a grand slam in Game 6), hit a two-run triple in Game 7, and totalled eight RBIs.|$|E

About [...] north of the capital where two mountain ranges join {{from east to west}} is the only pass into the capital; known as Sacramento Pass, this point is now part of present-day Chihuahua City. The Battle of Sacramento was the most important battle fought in the state of Chihuahua because it was the sole defense for the state capital.
