5|$|There {{had been}} heavy rain in Liverpool {{in the week}} before the first leg. Nevertheless, Austrian referee Erich Linemayr decided that the first leg on 9 May would <b>still</b> <b>go</b> ahead.

The referee took the decision to abandon the game after 27 minutes with the match to be played the next day.|$|E
5|$|In all organisms, {{two steps}} are {{required}} to read the information encoded in a gene's DNA and produce the protein it specifies. First, the gene's DNA is transcribed to messenger RNA (mRNA). Second, that mRNA is translated to protein. RNA-coding genes must <b>still</b> <b>go</b> through the first step, but are not translated into protein. The process of producing a biologically functional molecule of either RNA or protein is called gene expression, and the resulting molecule is called a gene product.|$|E
5|$|Augustine {{believed}} that a physical Hell exists, but that physical punishment is secondary to the punishment of being separated from God. He proposed two reasons for this: Firstly, humans have free will, and only those who choose to follow God will be forgiven and able to avoid Hell. Secondly, he {{believed that}} Adam and Eve's choice to sin affected our free choice, and that humans are left unable to resist sin. Augustine proposed that the grace of Jesus Christ freed humans from original sin, but he maintained that humans can only be saved {{if they choose to}} receive grace, and that this choice is formed by the character of individual humans. Accepting that even those who will be saved continue to sin, Augustine proposed that those who choose God's grace will <b>still</b> <b>go</b> to Hell for a time to purge them of their sin, before going to Heaven.|$|E

However, they will <b>still</b> <b>go</b> {{to great lengths to}} conceal their true identities; in effect, the mask is synonymous with the luchador.

25|$|There, {{a fabulous}} welcome awaited them.

25|$|Cyber Chicken Animation Studio and DQ Entertainment Limited animate {{the series}} in {{traditional}} 2-D. The character designs are kept from the web series, with some changed details; such as cleaner lines and brighter eyes. Despite {{the fact that}} both versions use Adobe Flash to create animation, the television episodes are cleaner-looking. This is probably because the characters and backgrounds in the web episodes were made of overlapping JPEG files, and that the television series has an actual budget. Also, the colors <b>still</b> <b>go</b> outside the outlines, but it seems more like a second outline than messy drawing. Every building was changed; in the web cartoon most buildings were grey, but was changed to different colors for the TV version. Vendetta's house is now dark green and Charlotte's blue.|$|E
25|$|Gudas was {{thrust into}} a top-4 role on defense for the season, with Eric Brewer being {{moved to a}} more {{manageable}} 3rd pair role. Gudas continued to play his physical game that he had become known for in his first full NHL season. His rough and tumble in-your-face game also landed Gudas in trouble at a few points during the season. The biggest incident involved Panthers forward Scottie Upshall squirting Gudas {{with a bottle of}} water from after he had fallen in front of the Panthers bench. Gudas would retaliate by smashing his stick on the Panthers in frustration. He would be ejected from the game for his actions, though the Lightning would <b>still</b> <b>go</b> onto to win the game despite being down a defensemen {{for the remainder of the}} game. Gudas also received a match penalty against the Dallas Stars on 5 March 2014. Though it was announced by Lightning General Manager Steve Yzerman that there would not be any additional discipline from the league. Gudas finished his first full NHL season by playing three games in the Stanley Cup playoffs for the Tampa Bay Lightning in a 4 sweep by the Montreal Canadiens.|$|E
25|$|Following the 1982 Kangaroo Tour, Sterling {{had been}} highly sought after by English clubs {{and he went}} on to play for Hull F.C. in the 1983–84 English season. Sterling played , and was man of the match winning the White Rose Trophy in Hull's 29-12 victory over Hull Kingston Rovers in the 1984 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1984–85 season at Boothferry Park, Kingston upon Hull, on Saturday 27 October 1984. He was then chosen for Game 1 of the 1984 State of Origin series, but lost his place to Steve Mortimer {{for the rest of the}} series. Sterling was then {{overlooked}} for the home Ashes series against Great Britain in 1984, but would <b>still</b> <b>go</b> on to win the Rugby League Week Player of the Year award for the first time. In the 1984 Grand Final, Sterling and longtime partner in crime Brett Kenny had few opportunities against Mortimers Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs whose forwards dominated the Eels pack and gave the star pairing little room to move. The narrow 6-4 loss to the Bulldogs ended the now John Monie coached Parramatta's bid for a 4th successive premiership.|$|E

25|$|The Army Council instead sanctioned {{a mortar}} attack on Downing Street, and in mid-1990 two IRA members {{travelled}} to London {{to plan the}} attack. One of the IRA members was knowledgeable about the trajectory of mortars and the other, from the IRA's Belfast Brigade, was familiar with their manufacture. An active service unit bought a Ford Transit van and rented a garage, and an IRA co-ordinator procured the explosives and materials {{needed to make the}} mortars. The IRA unit began making the mortars and cutting a hole in the roof of the van for the mortars to be fired through. They reconnoitred locations in Whitehall to find a suitable place from which the mortars could be fired at the back of 10 Downing Street, the Prime Minister's official residence and office. Once preparations were complete the two IRA members returned to Ireland, as the IRA leadership considered them valuable personnel and did not wish to risk them being arrested in any follow-up operation by the security services. In November 1990 Margaret Thatcher unexpectedly resigned from office, but the Army Council decided the planned attack should <b>still</b> <b>go</b> ahead, targeting her successor John Major. The IRA planned to attack when Major and his ministers were likely to be meeting at Downing Street, and waited until the date of a planned cabinet meeting was publicly known.|$|E
