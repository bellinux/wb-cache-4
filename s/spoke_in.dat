5|$|Seymour and {{his small}} group of new {{followers}} soon relocated {{to the home of}} Richard and Ruth Asberry at 216 North Bonnie Brae Street. White families from local holiness churches began to attend as well. The group would get together regularly and pray to receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit. On April 9, 1906, after five weeks of Seymour's preaching and prayer, and three days into an intended 10-day fast, Edward S. Lee <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> tongues for the first time. At the next meeting, Seymour shared Lee's testimony and preached a sermon on Acts 2:4 and soon six others began to speak in tongues as well, including Jennie Moore, who would later become Seymour's wife. A few days later, on April 12, Seymour <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> tongues for the first time after praying all night long.|$|E

5|$|A {{year after}} Gui's disappearance, {{there is a}} general {{consensus}} among commentators that the five booksellers were abducted by Chinese authorities. As of October 2016, Gui has spent a year in detention, while the other four men were released in early March 2016. One colleague, Lam Wing-kee, gave an interview that received significant media coverage in which he <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> great detail about his abduction and his months in detention by mainland law enforcement in Ningbo and subsequently Shaoguan. Their other colleagues have remained low profile and refused comment.|$|E
5|$|After the Camp returned, Smith drew {{heavily from}} its {{participants}} to establish five governing {{bodies in the}} church, all originally of equal authority to check one another. Among these five groups was a quorum of twelve apostles. Smith gave a revelation saying that to redeem Zion, his followers would have to receive an endowment in the Kirtland Temple, and in March 1836, at the temple's dedication, many participants in the promised endowment saw visions of angels, <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> tongues, and prophesied.|$|E

5|$|As {{a lifelong}} Democrat, Beauregard worked to end Republican rule during Reconstruction. His {{outrage over the}} {{perceived}} excesses of Reconstruction was a principal source for his indecision about remaining in the United States and his flirtation with foreign armies, which lasted until 1875. He {{was active in the}} Reform Party, an association of conservative New Orleans businessmen, which <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> favor of civil rights and voting for former slaves, hoping to form alliances between African-Americans and Democrats to vote out the Radical Republicans in the state legislature.|$|E
5|$|Elected in 1901 to the Senate, Neild was a {{vigorous}} supporter of old-age pensions, {{free trade and}} several other causes, but his ambitions of promotion were never realised. Passionately loyal to the British Empire, he questioned aspects of the White Australia policy and <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> support {{of the children of}} Kanaka labourers facing deportation. His continued disputes with the military, including an attempt to have the commander of the Australian military forces found in contempt of Parliament, saw him lose respect among his colleagues and his later career was spent in comparative isolation. He lost his seat in 1910 and died the following year.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his return}} from New Zealand in 1946, Newall was raised to the peerage as Baron Newall, of Clifton upon Dunsmoor, in the county of Warwick.

5000|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1894 {{producing}} needles. With {{the growth of the}} bicycle industry, they started to make wheel <b>spokes.</b> <b>In</b> 1898, the company was registered as [...] "Carl Schwanemeyer, Aachener Stahlwarenfabrik AG".|$|R
60|$|The man at {{the wheel}} had forsaken it in a funk, and Captain Davenport had leaped and caught the <b>spokes</b> <b>in</b> time to prevent the ship from yawing in the current and going ashore.|$|R
50|$|For {{aerodynamics}} and rotating weight, it {{is generally}} better {{to reduce the number}} of <b>spokes</b> <b>in</b> the wheel. For high-end wheelsets, the spokes can be shaped to have a bladed cross-section, further reducing wind resistance.|$|R
5|$|Harding {{elected to}} conduct a front porch campaign, like McKinley in 1896. Some years earlier, Harding had had his front porch remodeled to {{resemble}} McKinley's, which his neighbors felt signified presidential ambitions. The candidate remained at home in Marion and gave addresses to visiting delegations. In the meantime, Cox and Roosevelt stumped the nation, giving hundreds of speeches. Coolidge <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> the Northeast, {{later on in the}} South, and was not a significant factor in the election.|$|E
5|$|Having already famously played Shylock in Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice on the Yiddish {{stage at}} the People's Theater, he played the role again in a 1903 Broadway production, {{directed}} by Arthur Hopkins. In this production, Adler spoke his lines in Yiddish {{while the rest of}} the cast <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> English. The New York Times review of Adler's performance was not favorable: in particular his naturalistic acting style was not what audiences of the period expected in a production of Shakespeare. Some other reviews (such as that in Theater magazine) were friendlier; in any event the same production was revived two years later.|$|E
5|$|In {{retirement}} Denning {{moved to}} Whitchurch and continued {{the work he}} had done outside court hours, lecturing and presenting awards. He also on occasion dispensed legal advice; in February 1983 he advised Patrick Evershed on the statutory duties of water suppliers. Further hip troubles were resolved with a full replacement in March 1983, although a fall later that year forced him {{to stay at home}} for six weeks. With free time on his hands Denning <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> the House of Lords on matters that interested him, supporting an amendment to the Abortion Act 1967 and bills designed to allow the administration of companies in financial difficulties.|$|E

5|$|The Redskins {{controversy}} began receiving {{more attention}} in 2013, {{starting with a}} symposium in February on the topic at the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, D.C. Subsequently, the Oneida Indian Nation of New York sponsored a series of radio ads in each city to coincide with games of the 2013 season, each featuring a targeted message. A broader range of persons <b>spoke</b> <b>in</b> favor of change or open discussion, including local government leaders, members of Congress, and President Barack Obama. Statements {{in support of a}} name change by civil rights and religious organizations were added to those that Native American groups have been making for decades.|$|E

40|$|The {{results and}} {{implications}} of dynamical and reflectance studies of <b>spokes</b> <b>in</b> the Voyager 2 low-resolution ring movie are presented. The spoke of greater interest (Spoke 1) can be traced from its first appearance on the morning and to its terminal dispersion on the evening side. Orbital velocities, reflectances, and reflectance profiles are reported. The behavior of Spoke 1 conforms to the plasma cloud model of spoke formation and evolution proposed by Goertz and Morfill (1983). A second <b>spoke</b> observed <b>in</b> the ring movie provides corroborating support for the observed behavior of Spoke 1...|$|R
