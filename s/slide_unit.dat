The system models, for instance, the <b>slide</b> <b>unit</b> of machine tools or positioning systems. The presented results, which are obtained both with numerical and perturbation methods, show clearly the evolution of resonance phenomena under various excitation amplitudes. Apart from the primary resonance, a number of super-harmonic resonances has been excited in the non-linear single-degree-of-freedom system. Hence, a resonance graph contains a number of peaks being below the natural frequency. The contact vibrations are associated with strongly non-linear phenomena like: asymmetry of vibrations, loss of contact, bending resonance peak, multi-stability, period-doubling bifurcations, chaotic vibrations, which are far from linear dynamics.

The system models, for example, the <b>slide</b> <b>unit</b> of machine tools or positioning systems. The main aim of the computational analysis is to present the evolution of the resonance phe-nomena under various amplitudes of the excitation force. The studies show that, beside the primary resonance, a number of superharmonic resonances appear, which take place in the single-degree-of-freedom non-linear system excited by a harmonic force. Thus, in a resonance plot, a number of peaks is observed. The superharmonic (ultraharmonic) resonances take place at excitation frequencies being below the natural frequency, and becoming stronger with the increase of the excitation amplitude.

40|$|AbstractAnisotropy and {{heterogeneity}} of friction and wear {{can result from}} anisotropic roughness of engineering surfaces and from anisotropic and heterogeneous microstructures present in many materials (wood, single crystals, ceramics, composites, layer-lattice materials, polymers, biomaterials, monomolecular layers). In sliding surfaces of some materials, kinematics of sliding initiates microstructural and frictional changes. This research deals with advanced constitutive models, which describe evolutions of frictional anisotropy and heterogeneity induced by the sliding kinematics. First-, second- and higher-order constitutive equations of friction are developed with respect to powers of a sliding path curvature. The first-order equation of the friction force has two independent variables: <b>sliding</b> velocity <b>unit</b> vector and its derivative. The second- and higher-order equations are polynomials with respect to odd order tensors composed by the <b>sliding</b> velocity <b>unit</b> vector and the derivative. In the equations, friction tensors of even orders describe anisotropy and inhomogeneity of friction and effects associated with the sliding kinematics. The sliding path curvature generates: (a) an additional resistance to sliding, (b) a constraint force normal to the sliding trajectory. The friction constitutive equations satisfy the axiom of objectivity. A condition of dissipated energy restricts the friction tensors and the radius of curvature.

40|$|Using a new 3 -D {{physical}} modelling technique we investigated the initiation {{and evolution of}} large scale landslides in presence of pre-existing large scale fractures and {{taking into account the}} slope material weakening due to the alteration/weathering. The modelling technique is based on the specially developed properly scaled analogue materials, {{as well as on the}} original vertical accelerator device enabling increases in the 'gravity acceleration' up to a factor 50. The weathering primarily affects the uppermost layers through the water circulation. We simulated the effect of this process by making models of two parts. The shallower one represents the zone subject to homogeneous weathering and is made of low strength material of compressive strength σ l. The deeper (core) part of the model is stronger and simulates intact rocks. Deformation of such a model subjected to the gravity force occurred only in its upper (low strength) layer. In another set of experiments, low strength (σ w) narrow planar zones sub-parallel to the slope surface (σ w l) were introduced into the model's superficial low strength layer to simulate localized highly weathered zones. In this configuration landslides were initiated much easier (at lower 'gravity force'), were shallower and had smaller horizontal size largely defined by the weak zone size. Pre-existing fractures were introduced into the model by cutting it along a given plan. They have proved to be of small influence on the slope stability, except when they were associated to highly weathered zones. In this latter case the fractures laterally limited the slides. Deep seated rockslides initiation is thus directly defined by the mechanical structure of the hillslope's uppermost levels and especially by the presence of the weak zones due to the weathering. The large scale fractures play a more passive role and can only influence the shape and the volume of the <b>sliding</b> <b>units...</b>|$|R
