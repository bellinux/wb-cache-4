50|$|Up to {{five million}} pet {{dogs in the}} UK, {{approximately}} 50% of the population, may perform undesirable separation-related behaviour when left home alone. Dogs were trained to move from a start position to a food bowl. When the bowl was {{on one side of}} the room ('positive' location, P) it contained a small quantity of food, and when on the opposite side ('negative' location, N) it was empty. In test trials, the bowl (empty) was placed at one of three ambiguous locations between P and N (near-positive (NP), middle (M), or near-negative (NN). Three test trials were presented at each location. The researchers measured how quickly the dogs moved to the ambiguous locations, fast indicating anticipation of food (an 'optimistic' judgement) or more slowly (a 'pessimistic' judgement). These cognitive bias tests show that dogs which exhibit high levels of separation-related behaviour in a <b>separation</b> <b>test</b> also have a more negative underlying mood.|$|E

40|$|Traditional fairing {{systems are}} {{designed}} to fully encapsulate and protect their payload from the harsh ascent environment including acoustic vibrations, aerodynamic forces and heating. The Orion fairing separation system performs this function and more by also sharing {{approximately half of the}} vehicle structural load during ascent.

A series of component-level development tests were completed to evaluate and characterize each component within Orion's unique fairing separation system.

40|$|Farm {{animals are}} social {{and are willing}} to work for access to social companions. To {{separate}} and isolate animals from each other is a strong stressor, and will induce fear. The fear of novel and fear-eliciting situations in social animals can be reduced by being a part of a group. The response to handling will probably not only be a reaction to humans, but will also be affected by the environment, the novelty of the situation and the social context. The aim of this project was firstly to study the effect of three different densities (1 m 2, 2 m 2 and 3 m 2) on fear responses and social behaviour in a <b>separation</b> <b>test</b> and human approach test. Secondly we wanted to study the relationship between fear responses and different types of social interactions on the individual level. Fifty four pregnant goats were selected and used in this study. They were housed in three different densities with three groups in each density. Each of the groups consisted of six goats. The <b>separation</b> <b>test</b> lasted for two minutes were vocalizations and flight attempts were recorded. The human approach test was performed right after the <b>separation</b> <b>test.</b> The scores from this test were used to determine the individuals reactivity. A human entered the pen, took one big step to the left or right and waited for five second before approaching the goat. When the animal was within reach the goat was given the opportunity to smell the hand of the human. The human would then crouch together and hold this position for 10 seconds. We predicted higher levels of vocalization and flight attempts in the second <b>separation</b> <b>test</b> in the high density. Our findings could not support this prediction. Number of vocalizations was significantly higher in the second <b>separation</b> <b>test,</b> but had no effect of density. Number of flight attempts was not affected by densities, but {{there was a significant difference}} between the two tests. We predicted that confidence score in the human approach test were affected by density. The results could not support this prediction. As predicted, the results showed a higher level of offensive initiated behaviours in the high level density than in lower densities. It will be difficult to make any conclusion about the level of fear in these tests since they go in different directions. The density had an effect on the number of offensive behaviour initiated and received. These results give us a clear indication that high densities give higher aggression among goats...|$|E

Methods: A group of 45 full-time sonographers was randomly assigned to receive weekly 30 -minute massage sessions, massages plus stretching exercises to be performed twice a day, or no intervention. Outcome measures were scores of the QuickDASH instrument and its associated work module at baseline and at 10 weeks of intervention.

40|$|Legacy {{aircraft}} platforms face many hurdles; when {{it comes}} to testing these include but are not limited to: shrinking budgets, low priority, and lack of instrumentation. These hindrances to test programs are not likely to change in the near future. New low cost interchangeable instrumentation systems are needed to fill the gap between current test capabilities and future requirements. In recent years, advances in technology have allowed instrumentation systems to greatly shrink both in size and cost. Some of these new instrumentation systems are designed to fit inside of a MK 80 series fuze well and are designed to look like existing bomb components. One of these is a small form factor instrumentation system nicknamed “ 6 DoF, ” because it transmits six degree of freedom information to a ground station. The 6 DoF is a completely self-contained instrumentation system that requires no aircraft interface to operate. The 6 DoF has provided a low cost data collection device for weapon <b>separation</b> <b>test</b> programs {{for the last couple of}} years.

40|$|Highlights • Pet {{dogs were}} tested in a brief <b>separation</b> <b>test</b> and filmed {{remotely}} using thermography. • Temperature was analyzed from selected patches of both ear pinnae simultaneously. • Social isolation {{was associated with a}} significant decrease in ear pinnae temperature. • Temperature of the two ears did not differ significantly from each other. • Long distance thermography is a useful tool in non-invasive stress monitoring. Abstract Infrared thermography can visualize changes in body surface temperature that result from stress-induced physiological changes and alterations of blood flow patterns. Here we explored its use for remote stress monitoring (i. e. removing need for human presence) in a sample of six pet dogs. Dogs {{were tested in}} a brief <b>separation</b> <b>test</b> involving contact with their owner, a stranger, and social isolation for two one-minute-periods. Tests were filmed using a thermographic camera set up {{in a corner of the}} room, around 7 m from where the subjects spent most of the time. Temperature was measured from selected regions of both ear pinnae simultaneously. Temperatures of both ear pinnae showed a pattern of decrease during separation and increase when a person (either the owner or a stranger) was present, with no lateralized temperature differences between the two ears. Long distance thermographic measurement is a promising technique for non-invasive remote stress assessment, although there are some limitations related to dogs' hair structure over the ears, making it unsuitable for some subjects...|$|E

40|$|Females of farm {{species can}} be exposed during their {{pregnancy}} to various stressors such as thermal stressors, social stressors, transports and aversive handling. In rats and primates, prenatal stress increases emotional reactivity, delays development {{as well as}} decreases birth weight. However, the effects of prenatal stress on goat kid behaviour are still unknown. The present experiment was designed to test if prenatal stress alters emotional reactivity in goat kids. Twelve pregnant dairy goats were transported 6 times for 1 hour during the last 5 weeks of pregnancy, while twelve pregnant goats were left undisturbed and served as controls. The kids were individually exposed to a novel environment and to social isolation at 10 and 30 days of age. Their basal cortisol concentrations were measured at 8 days of age together with their cortisol response to an ACTH injection at 30 days of age. In response to a novel environment (novel arena test and <b>separation</b> <b>test</b> in an unfamiliar environment), motor activity of prenatally stressed kids was decreased compared to control kids. They also sniffed more the environment and shivered more often than control kids. When the social <b>separation</b> <b>test</b> occurred in the familiar environment, prenatally stressed kids vocalised more.
