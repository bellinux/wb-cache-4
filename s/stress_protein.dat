Viral infection can stimulate synthesis of <b>stress</b> <b>proteins</b> and particular associations of viral and <b>stress</b> <b>proteins</b> have been documented. However, demonstrations of functions for <b>stress</b> <b>proteins</b> in viral life cycles are few. We have initiated {{an investigation of}} the roles of <b>stress</b> <b>proteins</b> in eukaryotic viral life cycles using as a model the Ty 3 retrovirus-like element of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. During stress, Ty 3 transposition is inhibited; Ty 3 DNA is not synthesized and, although precursor proteins are detected, mature Ty 3 proteins and virus-like particles (VLPs) do not accumulate. The same phenotype is observed in the constitutively stressed ssa 1 ssa 2 mutant, which lacks two cytoplasmic members of the hsp 70 family of chaperones. Ty 3 VLPs preformed under nonstress conditions are degraded more rapidly if cells are shifted from 30 degrees C to 37 degrees C. These results suggest that Ty 3 VLPs are destroyed by cellular <b>stress</b> <b>proteins.</b> Elevated expression of the yeast UBP 3 gene, which encodes a protease that removes ubiquitin from proteins, allows mature Ty 3 proteins and VLPs to accumulate in the ssa 1 ssa 2 mutant, suggesting that, at least under stress conditions, ubiquitination plays a role in regulating Ty 3 transposition...|$|R

Mercuric chloride (HgCl(2)) induces acute renal failure in rats by a single dosage. The present in vivo study was conducted to assess the efficacy of BIM against acute HgCl(2) nephrotoxicity. At different times after BIM and/or HgCl(2) exposure we evaluated renal morphology and the localization/abundance of three <b>stress</b> <b>proteins</b> (HSP 72, GRP 75, HSP 60) by electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. BIM delivery to rats 6 h before mercury, ameliorated damage to renal ultrastructure, with recovery of tubular and mitochondrial membranes 24 h after mercury treatment. In rats pretreated with BIM prior to HgCl(2) exposure, HSP 72 was significantly overexpressed in proximal tubules in a time-dependent manner. In contrast, the amounts of GRP 75 and HSP 60 after BIM pretreatment were comparable to the group treated with mercury alone, but these <b>stress</b> <b>proteins</b> had translocated to the nuclei at 14 and 24 h, respectively.

40|$|The {{intracellular}} {{level of}} free heat shock proteins, {{in particular the}} 70 -kDa <b>stress</b> <b>protein</b> family, has been suggested to {{be the basis of}} an autoregulatory mechanism by which the cell measures the level of thermal stress and regulates the synthesis of heat shock proteins. It has been proposed that the DNA-binding and oligomeric state of the heat shock transcription factor (HSF) is a principal step in the induction pathway that is responsive to the level of 70 -kDa <b>stress</b> <b>protein.</b> To test this hypothesis, we investigated the association between HSF and 70 -kDa <b>stress</b> <b>protein</b> by means of a coimmunoprecipitation assay. We found that 70 -kDa stress proteins associate to similar extents with both latent and active forms of HSF, although unlike other 70 -kDa <b>stress</b> <b>protein</b> substrates, the association with HSF was not significantly disrupted in the presence of ATP. Gel mobility shift assays indicated that active HSF trimers purified from a bacterial expression system could not be substantially deactivated in vitro with purified 70 -kDa <b>stress</b> <b>protein</b> and ATP. In addition, elevated concentrations of hsp 70 alone could not significantly inhibit induction of the DNA-binding activity of endogenous HSF in cultured rat cells, and the induction was also not inhibited in cultured rat cells or Drosophila cells containing elevated levels of all members of the heat shock protein family. However, the deactivation of HSF to the non-DNA-binding state after prolonged heat stress or during recovery could be accelerated by increased levels of heat shock proteins. Hence, the level of heat shock proteins may affect the rate of disassembly of HSF trimers, but another mechanism, as yet undefined, appears to control the onset of the oligomeric transitions...|$|E

Using two-dimensional electrophoresis we have analyzed shifts in <b>stress</b> <b>protein</b> profiles {{in response to}} energy deprivation {{as a model of}} ischemic injury to kidneys. A group of chaperones and stress-induced mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinases were analyzed. In addition to examining <b>stress</b> <b>protein</b> induction and phosphorylation we have also examined the mechanism of cytoprotection by heat shock protein 70 (Hsp 70). Our results show that, of the different stress proteins examined, only binding protein (BiP) and Hsp 70 were significantly induced upon energy deprivation. Other stress proteins, including Hsp 27, calnexin, Hsp 90 and ERp 57 showed alterations in their phosphorylation profiles. Three different MAP kinases, namely p 38, extracellular signal regulated kisase and c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) were activated in response to energy deprivation. While JNK activation was linked to apoptosis, activated-p 38 was involved in phosphorylation of Hsp 27. Study of inhibitors of Hsp 70 induction or pre-induction of Hsp 70 indicated that induced Hsp 70 was involved in the suppression of JNK activation thereby inhibiting apoptotic cell death.

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were {{to examine the effects of}} whole body heat stress and {{subsequent}} <b>stress</b> <b>protein</b> induction on glycolytic metabolism, mitochondrial metabolism, and calcium handling within the heart. The effect of heat stress on glycolytic and mitochondrial pathways was examined by measuring con-tractile performance in the presence of glucose and pyruvate, respectively. Calcium handling was assessed using force-inter-val relationships. Right ventricular papillary muscles taken from heat-stressed and control rabbit hearts were superfused with Kreb's solution containing either glucose or pyruvate and rendered hypoxic for 30 min. After reoxygenation, the greatest recovery of contractile function occurred in the heat-stressed muscles with pyruvate as substrate; there was, however, no difference in the force-interval relationship between the groups. The degree of contractile recovery was related to the content of the inducible 70 -kD but not the 65 -kD, heat <b>stress</b> <b>protein.</b> This study suggests that heat stress enhances the abil-ity of rabbit papillary muscle to use pyruvate, but not glucose, after reoxygenation, and that the differences seen in contractil-ity may be secondary to induction of the 72 -kD <b>stress</b> <b>protein...</b>|$|E

In this study, we demonstrate that clusterin (i) inhibits stress-induced precipitation of a very broad range of structurally divergent protein substrates, (ii) binds irreversibly via an ATP-independent mechanism to <b>stressed</b> <b>proteins</b> to form solubilized high molecular weight complexes, (iii) lacks detectable ATPase activity, (iv) when acting alone, does not effect refolding of <b>stressed</b> <b>proteins</b> in vitro, and (v) stabilizes <b>stressed</b> <b>proteins</b> in a state competent for refolding by heat shock protein 70 (HSP 70). Furthermore, we show that, at physiological levels, clusterin inhibits stress-induced precipitation of proteins in undiluted human serum. Clusterin represents the first identified secreted mammalian chaperone. However, reports from others suggest that, at least under stress conditions, clusterin may be retained within cells to exert a protective effect. Regardless of the topological site(s) of action, the demonstration that clusterin can stabilize <b>stressed</b> <b>proteins</b> in a refolding-competent state suggests that, during stresses, the action of clusterin may inhibit rapid and irreversible protein precipitation and produce a reservoir of inactive but stabilized molecules from which other refolding chaperones can subsequently salvage functional proteins...|$|R
