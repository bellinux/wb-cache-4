40|$|Binaries {{are very}} common in galaxies, {{and more than half}} of Galactic hot subdwarf stars, which are thought as a {{possible}} origin of UV-upturn of old stellar populations, are found in binaries. Previous works showed that binary evolution can make the <b>spectra</b> of <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> populations significantly different from those of single star populations. However, the effect of binary evolution has not been taken into account in most works of spectral fitting of galaxies. This paper studies the role of binary evolution in spectral fitting of early-type galaxies, via a stellar population synthesis model including both single and <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> populations. <b>Spectra</b> from ultraviolet to optical band are fitted to determine a few parameters of galaxies. The results show that the inclusion of binaries in stellar population models may lead to obvious change in the determination of some galaxy parameters and therefore it is potentially important for spectral studies. In particular, the ages of young components of composite stellar populations become much older when using <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> population models instead of single star population models. This implies that <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> population models will measure significantly different star formation histories (SFHs) for galaxies compared to single star population models. In addition, stellar population models with binary interactions measure larger dust extinctions than single star population models on average. It suggests that when using <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> population models instead of single star population models, negative extinctions are possibly unnecessary in spectral fitting of early-type galaxies.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} techniques for astrophysics with adaptive optics is the ability to do spectroscopy at diffraction limited scales. The extreme difficulty of positioning a faint target accurately on a very narrow slit can be avoided by using an integral field unit, which provides the added benefit of full spatial coverage.

40|$|Some {{pulsating}} {{stars are}} good clocks. When {{they are found}} in <b>binary</b> <b>stars,</b> the frequencies of their luminosity variations are modulated by the Doppler effect caused by orbital motion. For each pulsation frequency this manifests itself as a multiplet separated by the orbital frequency in the Fourier transform of the light curve of the star. We derive the theoretical relations to exploit data from the Fourier transform to derive all the parameters of a binary system traditionally extracted from spectroscopic radial velocities, including the mass function which is easily derived from the amplitude ratio of the first orbital sidelobes to the central frequency for each pulsation frequency. This is a new technique that yields radial velocities from the Doppler shift of a pulsation frequency, thus eliminates the need to obtain <b>spectra.</b> For <b>binary</b> <b>stars</b> with pulsating components, an orbital solution {{can be obtained from}} the light curve alone. We give a complete derivation of this and demonstrate it both with artificial data, and with a case of a hierarchical eclipsing binary with Kepler mission data, KIC 4150611 (HD 181469).

40|$|The {{complexity}} of composite <b>spectra</b> of close <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> system makes {{study of the}} spectra of their component stars extremely difficult.

In a long-term observational project we aim to fill this gap with systematic abundance studies for the variety of binary systems.
